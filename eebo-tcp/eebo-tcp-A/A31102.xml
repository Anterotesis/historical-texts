         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But before I proceed to the Diviſion and Differences of Parts, I ſhal briefly reſolve this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,<note place="margin">Which Part of the Body is firſt generated.</note> 
               <hi>Which Part of the Body is firſt generated.</hi> We muſt therefore know, that according to <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> all the Parts are formed and differenced at one and the ſame time, as in a Circle, there is neither beginning nor end, but altogether are both beginning and end. But all the Parts are not perfected and adorned at one and the ſame time; but in the firſt place the Navil-vein. 2. The Liver. 3. Afterwards the Heart (which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would have to be firſt made, as <hi>Galen</hi> would have the Liver to be) and laſtly the brain. The Navil-vein therefore, is firſt finiſhed and perfected, in regard of the enlargement thereof by the blood, but not in reſpect of its firſt Conſtitution of the Seed. But others ſaid that the Groundwork or underwarpe of the Parts is Seed, and the Woof or Superſtructure blood, ſuppoſing that there are two material Principles of the body: Seed and blood. Which Opinion I have refuted and ſufficiently explained in my <hi>Anatomical Controverſies, Quaeſt.</hi> 11. <hi>touching the Parts and their Faculties and Functions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore the Veſſels are ſaid in reſpect of Perfection to be generated before the bowels,<note place="margin">Why the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were to be made before the Bowels.</note> and that juſtly. For otherwiſe the bowels could not be nouriſhed without a proportionable Inſtrument to that end, namely a Vein, by which the blood is conveighed for their Nutriment. For as out of a Kernel or Seed put into the Earth, firſt a long Root deſcends into the Earth, after that other Roots ſpread themſelves round about the Surface of the Earth, out of which afterwards, the Trunk and branches ſpring up; ſo out of the Seed committed to the Womb, there ariſes firſt the Navil-vein, receiving blood out of the Womb-cake; out of which Navil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vein ariſes the <hi>Vena Portae,</hi> with its Roots.</p>
            <p>Let us now come to the Diviſion or Differences of the Parts, which may be divers.</p>
            <p>Taking the word in a large Senſe, ſome divide them into parts of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> as the Heart, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,<note place="margin">Diviſion of the Parts.</note> Lungs, Stomach; and Parts of <hi>Commodity,</hi> and that either <hi>great</hi> as the Eyes and Stones, or <hi>leſs</hi> as the Nails; and parts of <hi>Ornament,</hi> as the Hairs of the Head and Beard.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall divide the Parts, chiefly in reſpect of their <hi>End,</hi> or in reſpect of their <hi>Matter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In reſpect of their End. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>The principal Parts.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>reſpect of the worthineſs of the End,</hi> ſome are <hi>Principal,</hi> others leſs principal and <hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Principal</hi> are the Liver, Heart, Brain, which are the Principles of other Parts. As, out of the brain ariſe the Nerves, according to the common Opinion, out of the Heart, the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, out of the Liver, the Veins. Others add the Teſticles, but without any need, becauſe they make nothing to the Conſervation of the Individual, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and Generation is cauſed without them, as I ſhall ſhew by Examples in the 7. Book Chap. 22.</p>
            <p>Now we do not mean the beginning of Radication or Original; for ſo, the Seed is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning<note place="margin">The Beginning or principle of Radication. The Original of Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

So from the Heart, as the beginning or Original of Diſpenſation, the Arteries ariſe, becauſe they receive their Virtue from the heart. and ſeem there to have their Original. The ſame may be ſaid of the Veins and Nerves in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their Originals.

reckoned, <hi>viz.</hi> the proper ſubſtance (ſetting aſide the other ſimilar parts, Veins, Arteries, &amp;c.) of the Brain, Tongue, Lungs, Heart, Liver, Gall-bladder, Spleen, Stomach, Guts, Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, Ureters, Piſs-bladder, Womb, Yard, Stones, Muſcles, Kernels. But it is in Vain for him to reckon theſe parts as new: for all in a manner are comprehended under Fleſh. For according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> there is a fleſh of the Muſcles, and a fleſh of the Bowels, and a fleſh of the Glandules or Kernels. But in another place <hi>Galen</hi> propounds a threefold fleſh. 1. In a Muſcle, which the <hi>Ancients</hi> did only cal Fleſh. 2. The <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> or proper ſubſtance of the Liver, Heart, Kidneys, &amp;c. 3. In the Stomach, Bladder, Veins. 4. In the Bones, though improperly.</p>
            <p>Whence we may gather four ſorts of Fleſh. 1. Muſculous fleſh, which <hi>Galen</hi> frequently<note place="margin">How many ſorts of Fleſh there are?</note> terms Fibrous fleſh, and it is ſoft and red and properly termed fleſh. And in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Language, by fleſh many times is ment the Muſcles. 2. Viſcerous fleſh or the fleſh of the Bowels. <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> cals it <hi>Parenchyma</hi> or an Affuſion of blood; <hi>Galen</hi> cals it Similar and ſimple fleſh, which ſupports the Veſſels of the bowels, fills up the empty ſpaces, and performs the Action. 3. Membranous fleſh, or the fleſhy ſubſtance of every Membranous part, as in the Gullet, Stomach, Guts, Womb, bladder. 4. Glandulous fleſh, or the fleſh of Kernels, which ſerves. 1. For to ſupport the diviſions of Veſſels. 2. To drink up ſuperfluous humors, eſpecially wheyiſh humors, becauſe the Kernels are of an hollow Spungy ſubſtance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are vulgarly termed <hi>Emunctories</hi> or Clenſers. Thoſe in the Neck being counted Clenſers of the Head; thoſe in the Arm-pits, of the Heart; thoſe in the Groyns of the Liver. 3. To moiſten the parts for their more eaſie motion, or otherwiſe to prohibit dryneſs. Such are thoſe which are ſituate by the Tongue, Larynx, Eye-corners, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But the ſimilar parts are reckoned to be <hi>ten:</hi> A bone, a Griſtle, a Ligament, a Membrane, a<note place="margin">The Number of the Similar Parts.</note> Fibre, a Nerve, an Artery, a Vein, Fleſh and Skin.</p>
            <p>Of theſe ſome are ſimilar only in the judgment of Senſe, as Veins, Arteries (ſome add Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles) others are ſimply and abſolutely ſimilar. That Veins, Arteries, Nerves, Muſcles are not truly ſimple and ſimilar, hath been rightly taught by <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> for a Muſcle conſiſts of Fleſh, Fibres, and a Tendon: Nerves are made up of the Dura and pia Mater, with Marrow: Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of two different coats; the Veins of a coat (and of Fibres as ſome will have it) and Valves. Simply and truly ſimilar parts are Bones, Griſtles, Ligaments, Membranes, Fibres, Fleſh and Skin. To theſe <hi>ſome</hi> add the Ureters, the Air implanted in the Ear, &amp;c. but in vain. For, 1. They are not parts common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the whole body, but proper to ſome parts. 2. The implanted Air of the Ears, is nothing but an implanted ſpirit, which cannot be reckoned among ſolid parts.</p>
            <p>Here we are to obſerve that all theſe <hi>parts</hi> are commonly divided, into <hi>Spermatical, Sanguine,</hi> or <hi>mixt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spermatical</hi> are made of ſeed, and ſuch are the eight firſt reckoned; which if they are cut<note place="margin">What a Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Part is?</note> aſunder, they breed not again, nor can they be truly united, but they are joyned together by a Callus in the middle, by reaſon of defect of matter and formative faculty, which acts not after the Conformation of the Parts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sanguine</hi> or fleſhy Parts, contrarywiſe are bred again, becauſe they are ſuppoſed to be<note place="margin">What a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Part.</note> made of Blood, as the Fleſh.</p>
            <p>A mixt Part is the Skin, of which we ſhall treat hereafter, in <hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>For feed and blood are commonly accounted the two general Principles of which we are made: ſo that in the Seed there is very little of the material principle, but much of the active, but in the blood much of the material principle, and but a little and weak portion of the active or effective principle. The firſt Rudiments and underwrap as it were of the parts, are ſaid to be made of Seed; and the woofe or ſuperſtructure of blood flowing in. But what the Truth is in Contradiction to this vulgar opinion, we have taught <hi>in our Anatomical Controverſies.</hi> For we are rather to hold, that the parts are at firſt made only of Seed, as of their matter; and that the Mothers blood doth nouriſh, and encreaſe and amplifie the Parts. The Skin in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to other Parts, hath an indifferent proportion of Seed, not ſo much as the Spermatical, nor ſo little as the Sanguinary parts.</p>
            <p>The Compound or <hi>diſſimilar Parts</hi> are, thoſe which may be divided into divers unlike parts,<note place="margin">What a diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar part is?</note> as an Hand cannot be cut into other Hands, but into Bones, Muſcles, Veins, &amp;c. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar parts are by the Phyloſopher called Members: but they are vulgarly termed <hi>Organical</hi> or inſtrumental parts.</p>
            <p>Now in every Organ, there are for the moſt part, four kinds of parts. For example ſake,<note place="margin">Organical parts.</note> in the Eye there is, 1. That part by which the action, <hi>viz.</hi> Seeing is performed, namely the Chryſtalline Humor. 2. That without which it cannot be performed, as the Optick Nerve. 3. That by which it is the better performed, as the Coats and Muſcles of the Eyes. 4. That by which the action is preſerved, as the Eye-lids, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Diſſimilar parts are more or leſs Compounded, they are divided into four degrees or ranks.</p>
            <p>The 1. Is ſuch as are ſimilar to the ſenſe, as a Muſcle, Vein, Artery. The 2. Is made of the ſormer and the reſt of the ſimilars, as a Finger. The 3. is compounded of the ſecond, as an Hand, Foot, &amp;c. The 4. Is compounded of the third, as an Arm or Leg.</p>
            <p>Finally the <hi>Body is divided</hi> into its greateſt Members, as by ſome into the Head, Cheſt, Belly<note place="margin">con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb facs="tcp:41352:4"/>
Arms and the Legs. But others have better divided them into the <hi>Bellies</hi> and <hi>Limbs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bellies are certain remarkeable Cavities of the Body, wherein ſome noble bowel is placed: and as there are three principal Members, ſo are there <hi>three Bellies:</hi> the <hi>loweſt</hi> belly, commonly called Abdomen or the Paunch, contains the Liver and Natural parts. The <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> or Cheſt, containes the Heart and vital parts. The <hi>uppermoſt</hi> or Head contains the brain and Animal parts. The <hi>Limbs</hi> which were given us for more conveniency of living, are the Arms and the Legs.</p>
            <p>And therefore we ſhall make four books: 1. Of the Lower belly. 2. Of the Middle belly.<note place="margin">This whole Work divided into four Books and four Petty Books or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuals.</note> 3, Of the ſupream belly or Cavity, the Head. 4. Of the Limbs. And to theſe ſhall anſwer four <hi>Petty Books:</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> of the Veins which ariſe from the Liver in the lower Cavity. The <hi>ſecond</hi> of the Arteries which ariſe from the Heart, in the middle Cavity. The <hi>third</hi> of the Nerves, which are commonly thought to ſpring from the brain. The <hi>fourth</hi> of the bones, which are moſt what in the Limbs: and as the bones joyned together make a compleat frame and bodies as it were; ſo alſo do the Veins, Arteries, and Nerves.</p>
            <p>We may find another diviſion of the body in <hi>Fernelius,</hi> which nevertheleſs is of no uſe ſave<note place="margin">The diviſion of the Body ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Regions.</note> in Phyſick.

and Conſumptions, it many times grows thick. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut or torne, it ſends forth no Blood. 5. It is not of a red color, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor are the Excrements</hi> of any Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the matter thereof. Not the<note place="margin">Or of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</note> Excrements of the firſt or ſecond dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; for how ſhould it be made of Dung, Urin or Gall? Nor the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the third, For the third Digeſtion or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction hath a threefold Excrement. 1. Vaporous and thin which Expires. 2. Thin, but more ſolid then the former, of a wateriſh ſubſtance, ſuch as are Ichors and Wheyiſh humors, which by their ſharpneſs and Acrimony, would ſooner hinder the Generation of the Scarf-skin, or corrode the ſame after it is generated. 3. Thick, Clammy, and ſticking faſt, which <hi>Archangelus</hi> and <hi>Laurentius,</hi> do<note place="margin">Laurentius and Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> ſuppoſe to be dried and turned into the Scarf-skin, and they demonſtrate the ſame from the filth which is, in bathing, ſcraped from the foles of the Feet. And if their opinion were true, the Scarf-skin would come off in Baths.</p>
               <p>And therefore the matter thereof is <hi>another Excrement,</hi> viz. an Oyly,<note place="margin">The true mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scarf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin.</note> Thick, Clammy, and moiſt vapor (for of dry Exhalations the Hair is made) proceeding from the Skin and Members under the ſame. So we ſee in a Skillet of Water-gruel, a Skin grows over the top of the Gruel, being mad, of the vapors thereout aſcending, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed by cold.</p>
               <p>Now the Scarf-skin is <hi>bred,</hi> partly in the womb with the Skin, and partly without the Womb. Within, For 1. So there are the rudiments and beginnings of Hair, Teeth, Nails in the Child in the Womb, 2. Without the Scarf-skin, the skin would be moiſt, and the Humor would ſweat out with pain, as in gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and where <hi>Phoenigmi</hi> are applied. 3. Experience ſhews, that the Scarf-skin is ſomewhat apparent in an Abortion, and may be ſeparated by ſome fretting Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity. But whiles the Child is in the Womb, it is exceeding tender, ſoft, and but as yet begun to be made: becauſe there is not in the Womb ſo much cold, only a ſmall degree ſpringing from the ſerous humor which ſurrounds the Child. But it receives its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement and perfection without the Womb, from the coldneſs of the Air, which doth more condenſe and dry, which is the Cauſe that the skin of all New-born In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants looks red.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the remote and internal <hi>Efficient</hi> thereof is in the inward heat of the<note place="margin">The Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cauſe thereof.</note> Body, thruſting forth a vapor into the ſurface thereof, as Exhalations are made by the ſuns heat. The next and external, is the coldneſs of ſomebody, as the Air, &amp;c. compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thickning. So Gruel, Hot milk, and other hot diſhes of meat, have a skin growing over them: ſometimes alſo the dryneſs of the Ambient Air, conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the external humor, and compacting the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the matter. Now by how much the ſaid vapor is more Earthy and Clammy, by ſo much more ſolid is that which is bred thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vſe</hi> thereof is to defend the Skin. And therefore 'tis ſomwhat <hi>hard,</hi> howbeit <hi>exceeding thin</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vſe.</note> and yet tranſparent, like the tranſparent skins of Onions; leaſt if it were thicker, the skin ſhould not feel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Yet not over cloſe and compact, leaſt it ſhould hinder the bodies tranſpiration And it is cloſe wrought, not only to defend the parts under it but that alſo too great an efflux of Vapor, Blood, Spirit and heat might not happen. For it is the cover of the Mouths and extremities of the Veſſels. And therefore thoſe cannot live in good health that are born without a Scarf-skin; as was ſeen in <hi>Lewes</hi> the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungaria,</hi> who became gray hair'd while he was but a Boy.</p>
               <p>It is of a <hi>white color,</hi> and therefore of a<note place="margin">The color of the Scarf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin.</note> 
                  <hi>cold and dry temper and quite void of Blood,</hi> For being torn or cut, it ſends forth no Blood. Nor is it nouriſhed by Blood, as <hi>Lauremberg</hi> and <hi>Sperlinger</hi> would have it; for it is not intrinfically nouriſhed by attraction of its proper Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but by addition of parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the vapor growing into the like nature of the Scarf-skin, as <hi>Caſſerus</hi> rightly diſputes, The Scarf-skin is black in Blackmores, but not the skin beneath it.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>number:</hi> there is but one Scarf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin;<note place="margin">Its number.</note> only there was once two found by <hi>Aquapendent:</hi> the one being ſtrongly faſtned in the pores of the skin, and inſeperable: the other ſeperable without offence to the skin. Which happens in ſome only, not in all parts of the Body. Alſo <hi>Laurembergius,</hi> in applying Veſicatories, found the Scarf-skin double; but that is a rare caſe, for that Veſicatories do peitce unto the skin is apparent from the humor dropping out, and the pain. In brawny Calloſities, indeed there are many little skins, as it were the skins of Onyons; but they are beſides nature, whoſe Generation and cure is delivered by <hi>Fallopius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In point of <hi>Connexion,</hi> it ſticks ſo<note place="margin">Its Connexion.</note> cloſe to the Skin of a man, while he is alive, as if it were one continued body therewith. Yet many times it is caſt off as ſnakes and ſerpents caſt their skins, which <hi>Felix Platerus</hi> tells us did happen to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and which happens in burning Feavers and the ſmall Pox. <hi>Salmuth</hi> obſerved as much in ſome Gouty perſons, in an Ague, and ſome other caſes.

Now it is chiefly in thoſe parts which are more ſtrongly moved then the reſt, hard like Suet, and interwoven between the Fibres and little Veins, as in the Palm of the Hand, the inner ſides of the Fingers (for there are many tendons, Nerves and Veſſels, which ought to be moiſtened) in the ſole of the Foot, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Heel.

               <p>
                  <hi>Caecilius Folius</hi> hath larely written<note place="margin">It is not made of Chyle.</note> that the matter whereof fat is made, is the milky juyce, or fatter portion of the Chylus, and that therewith the Bones are nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

That Children ſhould preſently become fat as we ſee it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in Children new born, who have been nouriſhed only with their Mothers Blood. 4. That the Chylus is neceſſarily changed before it come unto the Parts. 5. There is no paſſage from the Meſentery to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream parts of the body; for it is neither ſuckt through the Membranes, as ſome learned men ſuppoſe, nor is it carried through the Glandules. Not the former. 1. Becauſe they are thicker, then to ſuck and draw as threads. 2. They would appear ſwoln, and would in Anatomy diſcover ſome Oyly moiſture in them. Nor the latter, 1. Becauſe the Kernels are not continued with the fat parts. 2. Nor do they receive any profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able humor, but Excrements, yea they abound with a white, flegmatick, but not a fat humor. 3. We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that many creatures grow fat which have no Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels.

Fat; ſo about the Heart Fat is collected, for there is the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardium,<note place="margin">And about the Heart?</note> a cold and thick Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane; alſo the wheyiſh Humor contained therein: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it there is the Midriff as a Fan, on either fide the Lungs like Bellows, the Mediaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num &amp;c. So about the the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys<note place="margin">And the Kidneys?</note> Fat is gathered, becauſe they abound with a wheyiſh Excrement, lie near the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, and are covered by the Guts.</p>
               <p>5. A Cover hanging over boyling Water, coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Vapors which ariſe unto it, and turns them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to water by its Coldneſs. For make the Air round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout exceeding hot, and then the Vapors ſtriking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the cover, will not be condenſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another Opinion</hi> is, that Fat is made by an hot Cauſe, becauſe the matter thereof<note place="margin">An Opinion that Fat is cauſed by Heat.</note> is hot, and becauſe Fat eaſily flames; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe all things are made in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by Coction, and Heat. But the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is clear from what hath been ſaid before. And we do not mean meer Coldneſs, the Cauſe of Crudity, but a weak Heat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some</hi> ſay that Fat attains its conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency from the compactneſs of the<note place="margin">An Opinion that it is made by compactneſs. Refuted.</note> Membranes, for that which is itſelf compact makes other things ſo. I anſwer. That cold things condenſe, and Condenſation proceeds from Cold, nor can that which is condenſed condenſe, unleſs it were a firſt Quality, or ſhould take the aſſiſtance of Cold, for otherwiſe the thinneſs of the Membrane would make the fat thin. And why does not the den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity or compactneſs of the Veſſels make the matter contained to be condenſed and compact?</p>
               <p>2. In like manner they object: By a thick cover though very hot, the Vapor ariſing from boyling Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when it meets therewith, is turned into Water, or in a Diſtillation by an Alembick, the Exhalations ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the ſubject matter, meeting with the thick glaſs are ſtopped, and by reflection turned into a thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Subſtance. But the Anſwer, is clear from what hath been ſaid; moreover, the Vapors which are raiſed up by boyling, if they are by the Veſſel ſo ſhut in, that there is no place to breath out, new Vapors continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſing, that there may not be a Penetration of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it is neceſſary, that they reaſſume their former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency: But if they find egreſs, they turn to Water, by reaſon of the cold Air ſurrounding the glaſſie Cover. And therefore it is that, to make the Liquor iſſue more aboundantly, Diſtillers ever and anon cool the ſame with cold Water. So when the Air abroad is cold, hot Vapors within do turn to Water upon the glaſs Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; which does not happen when the Air is hot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
               <p>3. They ſay, that there are many cold Parts, as the Brain and its coats, &amp;c. which have no Fat about them. I anſwer, thoſe Parts alſo are denſe. Nor would Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have Fat in thoſe Parts, for it would be both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and hurtful: And a moderate Heat is there provided for, by the thickneſs of the Skin, the Hair and the Skull.</p>

But no man can eaſily obſerve the diſſimilitude of the fibres, either within the body, or without.</p>
               <p>The Fat of the Belly hath three <hi>Veins,</hi> the external Mammillary deſcending from<note place="margin">Its Veſſels.</note> above the <hi>Vena Epigaſtrica,</hi> ariſing from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath out of the crural Vein, through the Groins, and very many Veins coming out of the Loins, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Arteries. And through theſe, and the Veſſels of the Skin, Cupping-glaſſes and Scarifications draw Humors out of the inner Parts, as far as I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of Fat is 1 To keep warm like<note place="margin">Its Uſes.</note> a Garment, to cheriſh Natural Heat, by its Clammyneſs, hindring the going forth thereof, and by its thickneſs, ſtopping the Paſſages, leaſt Cold ſhould enter; and in Summer, they keep out the Heat.</p>

               <p>3. To daub and moiſten hot and dry parts, ſuch as is the Heart.</p>
               <p>4. To facilitate Motion, provided it be moderate, for abundance of Fat hinders Motion and all other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and to keep the Parts from being over dried, diſtended, or broken. Hence it defends the ends of Griſtles, the Joyntings of the greater Bones; and it is placed on the outſide of certain Ligaments, alſo about the Veſſels carried to the Skin. For this very cauſe, there is ſtore of Fat in the Socket of the Eye, leaſt by reaſon of continual Motion, it ſhould become dry and withered as it were. And the <hi>Vena Coronalis</hi> of the Heart, is fenced with much Fat, to accommodate the great Motion and Heat of the Heart.</p>
               <p>5. It ſerves as a Pillow and Bulwark againſt Blows, Bruiſes, and Compreſſions. And therefore it is that Nature hath furniſht the Buttocks, and the Hollow of the Hands and Feet with plenty of Fat.</p>

                  <hi>carnoſa,</hi> or fleſhy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane lies, which in Apes, Dogs, and Sheep lies next the Skin. Before we treat thereof, ſome things are to be known concerning the Nature of a Membrane in general.</p>
               <p>The Ancients called the Membranes <hi>Hymenas,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Chitona's</hi> Coats, alſo <hi>Meningas;</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles <hi>Operimenta,</hi> and <hi>Tegumenta</hi> Coverings; and with <hi>Galen</hi> and other Anatomiſts, ſpeaking in a large Senſe, a Coat and a Membrane, are one and the ſame thing. But when they ſpeak in a ſtrickt and proper Senſe.</p>
               <p>That is a <hi>Membrane</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes ſome bulkie Part, as the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritonaeum,<note place="margin">The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a membrane and a Coat, and Meninx.</note> the Pleura, the Perioſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, the Pericardium, and the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Membranes of the Muſcles.</p>
               <p>But the term <hi>Tunica</hi> or Coat in a ſtrickt ſenſe, is attributed properly to the Veſſels, as Veins, Arteries, Ureters, the Womb, the Gall-blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the Piſs-bladder, the Gullet, the Stomach, the Guts, the Stones.</p>
               <p>The term <hi>Meninx</hi> is properly given and peculiarly to the Membranes of the Brain.</p>
               <p>Now a Membrane is a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part broad, plane, white,<note place="margin">What a Membrane is?</note> and which may be ſtretched, made by a proper Membrane-making faculty, of clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and watery Seed, to the end that it might by cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing defend the Parts.</p>
               <p>The Form thereof is the equality of its Surface, Thinneſs, and Lightneſs (leaſt it ſhould burden) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactneſs and ſtrength that it might be widened and ſtretched.</p>
               <p>Its Uſe is 1. To cloath and defend the Parts by reaſon of its hardneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactneſs;<note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note> and to be the Inſtrument of feeling: For the Parts feel by help of the Membranes. And ſo great is the neceſſity of Membranes, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath covered every Part with a Membrane. 2. To ſtrengthen the parts. 3. To defend the parts from the injury of the Cold, and to keep the Natural Heat from exhaling. 4. To joyn parts with parts. So the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery knits the Guts to the Back. 5. To ſhut the mouths of the Veſſels, leaſt the Humors ſhould flow out, or flow back: As in the Bladder, where the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are implanted, in the Ventricles of the Heart, by the Valves.</p>
               <p>Now a <hi>Membrane</hi> is <hi>thicker</hi> or <hi>thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Difference of Membranes.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>thin</hi> Membrane differs in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For the Perioſtium of the Ribs is thinner then the Pleura, the Perioſtium of the Head, is thinner then the Pericraneum; the <hi>pia mater</hi> is thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then the <hi>dura mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>thick Membrane</hi> is the <hi>Membrana carnoſa,</hi> which is not every where alike thick; for it is thicker in the Neck then other places. And now let us ſpeak of the <hi>Membrana carnoſa,</hi> or fleſhy Membrane.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Panniculus carnoſus</hi> or <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The fleſhy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane what for a thing it is?</note> 
                  <hi>carnoſa</hi> is by ſome termed a membranous Muſcle, by others a Nervie Coat, a fattie Coat, &amp;c. It is termed fleſhy, becauſe in ſome places, as about the Forehead, the compaſs of the Neck, and the Ears, it turns to a muſculous fleſh, and in ſuch Creatures as by the help hereof can move their whole Skin, it ſeems to be a Muſcle: It is endued with ſuch fleſhy Fibers, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in their Necks, by the motion whereof they drive away flies. But in Man, ſave in his Forehead, it is immoveable; only <hi>Veſalius</hi> and <hi>Valverda</hi> report that there were ſome men who could move the Skin on their Cheſt and Back, and in other parts, juſt as oxen do. In whom doubtleſs this Membrane was made of the ſame conſtitution, which it hath in Brutes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in new-born Children, it reſembles fleſh, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of plenty of blood; in grown perſons it is like a Membrane, by reaſon of continually being dried. In a Mans Body, if exact Separation be made, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to conſiſt of four diſtinct Membranes. <hi>Spigelius</hi> and others do take thoſe membranous Fibers, which are every where interwoven among the Fat, to be <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculus carnoſus,</hi> or <hi>Membrana carnoſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is 1. To defend the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note> Parts, yea, and to cover and defend the whole Body, and therefore it is ſituate all over the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>2. To keep in the Fat, that it flow not out, or melt by reaſon of the continual motion of the Muſcles.</p>
               <p>3. To ſupport thoſe Veſſels which are carried into the Skin (which go between<note place="margin">Connexion.</note> the Skin and this Membrane) for it is <hi>knit unto the Skin</hi> by very many Veins, ſome fewer Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, branches of Nerves, and membranous Fibers; and to the Membranes under the Muſcles, by the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Fibers. It is therefore falſe, that when the Fat is conſumed by faſting, the Skin ſticks to the Muſcles no otherwiſe, then a Ball to a peice of cloth wherewith it is covered. It ſticks moſt<note place="margin">Original.</note> firmly to the Back, in faſhion of a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, and therefore it is ſaid to ariſe from thence. In the former part of a Mans Neck and his Forehead, it can hardly be ſeparated from the Skin and the <hi>Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus latus;</hi> it ſticks ſo cloſe, and is thought to conſtitute the <hi>Muſculus latus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Surface</hi> thereof is ſlippery, there where it tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the Muſcles, by reaſon of that clammy Humor, which is wont to be daubed upon the Membranes, leaſt the motion of the Muſcles ſhould be hindred. It is of exquiſite ſenſe; and therefore if it be twitched by a ſharp Humor, it cauſes ſhivering and ſhaking, as by Choler in Agues.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Muſcles in General.</head>
               <p>A Muſcle is termed in Greek <hi>Mus</hi> a Mouſe, becauſe it reſembles a flaid Mouſe; and the Latins cal it <hi>Lacertus</hi> a Lizard, from its ſimilitude with that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Howbeit we cannot allot one certain figure to the Muſcles, by reaſon of their variety.</p>
               <p>A Muſcle is an Organical Part, the Inſtrument of voluntary motion. For<note place="margin">What a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is?</note> only this part can receive the Iuflux of the motive faculty. <hi>Helmont</hi> allowes the muſcles a life peculiar to themſelves, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues for a while, even after death, as the convulſive motion in the Falling-ſickneſs which continues invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily. Which nevertheleſs does more truly ariſe, from the retraction and drineſs of the Nerves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Spirits. Alſo the ſame man is in an error in conceiving that new fibres do ariſe in the muſcles, and cauſe the Palſie. No man ever ſaw them, nor can they be bred anew, becauſe they are Spermatick parts. The Palſie ought rather to be referred to a defect of ſome fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres.</p>
               <p>A muſcle is an Organical part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it conſiſts 1. Of fleſh. 2. Of<note place="margin">A Muſcle is an Organical part.</note> a tendinous part (and theſe are the two parts of a muſcle, which perform the Action) 3. Of Veins to carry back the Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 4. Of Arteries preſerving the inbred Heat, and bringing the Nouriſhment to the part. 5. Of Nerves, which contribute ſenſe and eſpecially motion. For the Brain ſends the motive faculty through the Nerves into the Muſcles. 6. Of Membranes which encompaſs and keep the muſcles together. 7. Of Fat which moiſtens them, and hinders them from being dried by over much motion.</p>
               <p>The Muſcles of the whole Body are moſt ſtraitly conjoyned one with<note place="margin">The Connexion of the Muſcles of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> another: Yet ſometimes they gape, and are at ſome diſtance, when Wind, wheyiſh Humor, or ſome other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gets between them; as in the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Pleuriſie, and concerning a Soldier whipt by the Turks. <hi>Veſlingus</hi> told me that his muſcles were ſo wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and ſeparated, that if he bent his body but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, every muſcle would bear it ſelf out from its Natural ſituation, bunching out as it were, and ſwelling.</p>
               <p>We divide the Muſcles into two <hi>parts,</hi> a <hi>fleſhy</hi> part, and a <hi>tendinous</hi> part.<note place="margin">The Parts of a Muſcle only two. The tendinous Part how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fold.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Again, we make the <hi>tendinous</hi> part to be either <hi>united,</hi> or <hi>diſgregated,</hi> and <hi>ſevered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>United,</hi> where the whole tendinous part appears, white and hard, either in the beginning, end, or middle; or in all theſe parts.</p>
               <p>Contrariwiſe it is <hi>diſgregated</hi> or <hi>ſevered,</hi> where it is divided into many ſmall fibres, ſcarce diſcernable to the ſight, being compaſſed about with fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous fibers may notwithſtanding be diſcerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the fleſhy ones, in boyled Hogs-fleſh, and in the fleſh of a Turkey-cock, &amp;c. So in ſome Muſcles, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> with fleſh. Somtimes the tendinous part appears, united in the end, and ſevered in the beginning, as in the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle Deltoides; ſomtimes it is tendinous in the middle, and ſomtimes not at all.</p>
               <p>With <hi>Aquapendent</hi> we define a<note place="margin">What the Tendon of a Muſcle is?</note> Tendon to be a Body continued from the beginning to the end of a Muſcle, and that it is a body of a peculiar Nature, cold and dry, made<note place="margin">Its Beginning.</note> of Seed, as the principle of its Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: But the beginning of its diſpenſation is a bone, for it ſprings from a bone, and is inſerted or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into a bone. Yet ſome Muſcles ariſe from Griſtles, and ſome from Tendons, and are implanted into them. And<note place="margin">Why called Tendo?</note> it is rightly termed <hi>Tendo,</hi> from ſtretching, becauſe it is bent and ſtretched like the ſtring of a bow.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Muſcle</hi> is otherwiſe divided into the <hi>Head, middle,</hi> and <hi>End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Reginning and Head of a Muſcle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Beginning and Head of a Muſcle.</note> when it is tendinous, is by <hi>Galen</hi> and other Anatomiſts, called <hi>Ligamentum,</hi> which they ſay is void of Senſe, and that it is leſs then a Tendon, or the end of a Muſcle.</p>
               <p>Now the beginning in a great part of Muſcles, is tendinous, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<note place="margin">Both the beginning and end of a Muſcle may be called a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</note> fleſhy. And to ſpeak the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth, the beginning may as well be termed a Tendon, as the end; ſeeing for the moſt part, ſuch as is the Beginning, ſuch is the End, in Subſtance, in Thinneſs, Lightſomneſs, Whiteneſs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now every Muſcle is ſaid to move towards its beginning,<note place="margin">Two things obſervable touching the beginning of a Muſcle.</note> and every Muſcle hath a Nerve, which is inſerted either into the Head, or about the middle (and in ſome through the Surface of the muſcle, in others through the Subſtance) ſo that where the Nerve is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, there is the Head of the Muſcle: Which <hi>Galen</hi> laies down as<note place="margin">Galens <hi>Rule.</hi>
                  </note> a ſure Rule, and ſaith; that if the Nerve be implanted into the Tayl, there is the Head of the muſcle. But<note place="margin">Diſliked by <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus;</hi> and why?</note> 
                  <hi>Johannes Walaeus</hi> an excellent learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Phyſitian, likes not this Rule, and conceives that it is all one, whether the Nerve be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted into the beginning, the middle, or the end. 1. Becauſe that Rule renders the motions of many muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles obſcure. 2. Becauſe it holds not true in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral muſcle, nor ſomtimes in other muſcles of the Cheſt and Belly. 3. Becauſe that Rule is not found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon any reaſon, for whether the Nerve be inſerted into the beginning of the muſcle, or into any other part thereof, the Spirits flowing in by the Nerve, may equally move the muſcle: As we ſee in Wind-Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Air is let in ſomtimes above, ſomtimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, one way as conveniently as another. 4. And whereas that Rule is oftentimes found true, it happens by accident, becauſe moſtmuſcles are moved upward, &amp; becauſe the Nerves deſcend from above, and therefore could not be more ſafely implanted any where, then in the upper part of the muſcles. And that which <hi>Riolanus</hi> objects againſt<note place="margin">The Objection of <hi>Riolanus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> 
                  <hi>Walaeus,</hi> touching the Contorſion or Wreathing of the recurrent Nerve, is nothing. For the Nerves run back, to avoid confuſion, otherwiſe, if Nature chiefly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Inſertion into the Heads of Muſcles, ſhe might
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41352:8"/>
have carried them right out into the Larynx, as ſhe doth other Nerves of the ſixt Pair. Some Muſcles receive two branches of Nerves, as the Midrif; ſome five, as the temporal Muſcle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Middle of the Muſcle,</hi> which they call the belly or body, doth for the<note place="margin">The middle of a Muſcle.</note> moſt part ſwell, and is fleſhy; ſome few have a tendon in the middle, as the Muſculus Digaſtricus which opens the nether Jaw, and the ſecond Pair belonging to the <hi>Os Hyoïdes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The end or taile of a Muſcle,</hi> is by ſome called <hi>Tendo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> by others <hi>Chorda,</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuroſis.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The end of a Muſcle how known by <hi>Galen</hi> and other Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts?</note> And the end is ſomtimes round, ſomtimes broad, ſomtimes long, other whiles ſhort; ſomtimes one, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles more then one. Now this end, or tendon, is commonly conceived to be made up of a Concourſe of Fibres, Ligaments, and very ſmal Nerves, which by little and little grow into one Body. For they will have a Nerve, when it comes to the place of a Muſcle to be divided into divers ſlips, which are met by a Ligament, cleft after the ſame manner. Conſequently they De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
               <p>1. That the Tendon hath the ſenſe of Feeling, but not the<note place="margin">Whether the Head of a Muſcle be void of ſenſe?</note> Head, which they account void of ſenſe and Motion. But this is falſe; becauſe the tendinous head of a Muſcle, when it is prickt, breeds Convulſions and cruel Symptomes, juſt as if the Head of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle were prickt. Moreover, the beginning of a Muſcle hath motion, and therefore ſenſe. It hath motion, becauſe a Muſcle, even in its<note place="margin">If it have Motion?</note> Head, is contracted and expanded, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is fleſhy.</p>
               <p>2. They ſay alſo that the End is thicker then the Head: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding<note place="margin">Whether the end be thicker then the Head.</note> is ſomtimes true and ſomtimes falſe, as in the Muſculous Biceps, and others.</p>
               <p>3. They will have the Tendon to be ſofter then the Ligament (as they call it) or the beginning of the Muſcle, namely ſo much ſofter, as it is harder then a Nerve, But the contrary is true, viz. that the Tendon is harder then the beginning, becauſe it many times changes into a boney and griſtley ſubſtance, as in the feet of feathered fowle; but the beginning doth not ſo. Moreover, I deny that Nerves enter into the Tendon. For <hi>Aquapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Whether the Nerves go into the Tendon.</note> and <hi>Riolanus</hi> have obſerved, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſſections, that when they are entred into the fleſh of the Muſcle, they are ſpread out into many little branches, which go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a certain Membranous flexure, and ſo vaniſh or end, before they come to the tendon. Moreover, a Nerve is ſoft, how therefore can it be mingled with an hard body? Neither is the end leſs deſtitute of ſenſe, then the Head, ſeeing there come no more Nerves to it then the other: for the Nerve being implanted, tends downwards, and not upwards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Action of a Muſcle</hi> is voluntary Motion.<note place="margin">The action of a Muſcle is Motion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Motion of a Muſcle, is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, 1. A Muſcle is contracted within it ſelf, towards the Head; and when this is done the oppoſite Muſcle is relaxed and looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. 2. Being contracted, it continues ſo. And theſe two motions are primary, <hi>per ſe</hi> and not acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. 3. After contraction it is relaxed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which motion is accidental, and proceeds from another. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Muſcles are alwaies ſet one againſt another, as Antagoniſts.</p>
               <p>Now the work of this Motion or Action, which is ſeen in the parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereinto the Muſcles are planted, doth vary according to the Variety of Parts. For in the throat it is ſwallowing; in the Arme bending and ſtretching forth, &amp;c. Yea and ſomtimes one follows upon another. For the Muſcles of the Cheſt, when they act, do diverſly widen or contract the ſame, they draw in Air, or expel Fuliginous ſooty vapors, and cauſe Reſpiration.</p>
               <p>This Motion of the Muſcles, is ſomtimes<note place="margin">And that Voluntary.</note> called Voluntary, ſomtimes Animal, to diſtinguiſh it from the natural, in Brutes Spontaneous. For we can haſten, or ſlacken, or ſtop this motion as we pleaſe. And in this motion, the will of a Man or the Appetite of Brutes, is like an Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man guiding and putting his Horſe forward; the Nerves reſemble the Reins of the Bridle, and the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are like the Horſe. There are ſome ſingular Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as of the inſide of the Eare, the Midrif, the Muſcles of the Cheſt, and Eye-lids, whoſe motion is partly voluntary and partly natural, becauſe they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times perform their actions, when we have no thought nor will thereto.</p>
               <p>The <hi>uſe</hi> of all the Parts of the Muſcle, is<note place="margin">The uſe.</note> after the ſame manner, as in every perfect Organ. For 1. There is that by which the action is primarily and of it ſelf performed, and it is the Fibrous fleſh; [but eſpecially according to the Fibres, for the fleſh being wounded according to the length of the Fibres, the motion remains unhurt, but it is not ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the fibres are wounded] for the moſt part the belly of the Muſcle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is moſt of all contracted. Hence it is that if you cut a Muſcle of in the beginning end or middle, in a living perſon, or in one that is dead it purſes it ſelf round and draws it ſelf into it ſelf like a ball: as alſo it doth, being caſt into the water. <hi>Riola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> counts the principal part to be the tendon, upon which the Action depends, becauſe it hath a peculiar ſubſtance of its own, ſuch as is no where to be ſeen out of a Muſcle. But this is rather true of fibrous fleſh, which is in all Muſcles, where as in ſome there is no tendon. 2. That without which it cannot be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as the Nerve: For if the Nerves be hurt the Muſcle looſes its motion. 3. That by which it is more ſtrongly and better performed, as the tendons and tendinous fibres. Wherefore thoſe Muſcles only, which perform conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual<note place="margin">Which Muſcles do move more ſtrongly?</note> and ſtrong motions, have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved united and Conſpicuous tendons. For the Muſcles do either move them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only, as thoſe of the Fundament and Bladder; or they move alſo the skin, as in the Lips, forehead and face: and in theſe there is no tendon to be ſeen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or they move a bone, and theſe for the moſt part evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently end in tendons, becauſe the ſtrong motion of an heavy member did require as much: or they move ſome other light thing, as the Muſcles of the tongue and Larynx (ſome of which have tendons and ſome not) of the Eyes, Stones and Yard. 4. Such parts as conſerve and guard the action, as the Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Membranes and fat.</p>

               <p>there are <hi>ſixteen Muſcles of the Belly</hi> for the moſt part, at leaſt and <hi>ſeldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fourteen,</hi> when there are only three right Muſcles on either ſide; <hi>ſomtimes eighteen,</hi> when there are five <hi>right ones</hi> found, on each ſide. <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> found them all, folded and wrapped up in an Embryo or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt Pair obliquely deſcendent,</hi> [or the external] ſo called by reaſon of the Fibres, which deſcend obliquely from the upper to the lower part; covers all the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> on its own ſide, ſeeing it is very great and broad.</p>
               <p>Its original is in the breaſt, from the lower part of the ſixt, ſeventh and eight<note place="margin">The Original of the oblique deſcending Muſcle.</note> Ribs, before they end in Griſtles; and it ariſes from ſundry triangular begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, or ſpires, [near the great ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhap'd Muſcle of the Breſt] which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grow into one. And to every triangular ſpire, from the ſpaces between its Ribs, and Nerve is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Moreover, it ariſes alſo [a ſmal ſpace being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed] from the point of the tranſverſe proceſſes of the Vertebra's of the Loyns. So largly is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof ſpread out, namely from the ſixt Rib to the loweſt Vertebra of the Loyns.</p>
               <p>It ends in the middle of the Abdomen, where a white line appears, and it ends into<note place="margin">Its End.</note> a large Tendon, an infinite company of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Fibres running together in that place.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>white Line,</hi> which is ſomtimes<note place="margin">What the white Line is?</note> fringed with fat, is the meeting together of the Tendons of the Muſcles of the Belly, ſaving thoſe of the right muſcles. For the Tendons of the oblique muſcles are united. and do ſo meet form both parts, that they form as it were a coat which covers the Belly, or as if it were but one Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
               <p>It is white, becauſe void of fleſh, proceeding from the <hi>Mucronata Cartilago</hi> or pointed Griſtle which is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Sharebone: and it is narrower below the Navil then above.</p>
               <p>The two muſcles obliquely deſcendent are bored through. 1. At the Navil. 2. At the Groyn in men, that the ſeed Veſſels may paſs through; in Women, to give paſſage to the two round and Nervy Ligaments of the Womb, which are terminated in the Privity near the <hi>Nymphes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41352:10"/>Now as touching the Original<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Error of</hi> Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent <hi>and</hi> Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius, <hi>touching the Original of the oblique-deſcending Muſcle.</hi>
                  </note> of the obliquely-deſcending muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>Aquapendant</hi> did long ſince hatch a contrary Opinion, which <hi>Laurentius</hi> did afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound as new, and of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, reprehending all other Anatomiſts, who were the ſaid miſerably deceived. Now this contrary Opinion will have theſe muſcles to be rather termed external Aſcendents, ſo that their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal ſhould be from the upper part of the <hi>Os pubis, Os Ilij,</hi> and from the tranſverſe Proceſſes of the Loins: And the end. in the Ribs. They prove it thus:</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe a muſcle ought to ariſe from ſome quiet and immoveable<note place="margin">Their firſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon refuted.</note> part, ſuch as is the Share-bone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Ribs. I anſwer, the Ribs are quiet and ſtill, being compared to the white Line.</p>
               <p>2. They ſay a muſcle draws towards its beginning, and becauſe the oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendent<note place="margin">Their ſecond Reaſon</note> ſerves for Reſpiration, it draws the Ribs towards the Share. I anſwer, this muſcle doth not primarily<note place="margin">anſwered.</note> ſerve for Reſpiration, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter.<note place="margin">Tis proved that theſe Muſcles ariſe from above, not from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now our Opinion, which is <hi>Galens,</hi> is proved. 1. By the Ingreſs of Nerves, which is about the beginning. 2. By the carriage of Fibres, which go here from the beginning to the white Line. 3. All confeſs that there is a Concourſe of Tendons, yea of thoſe which obliquely deſcend, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the white Line. Therefore the End is there. 4. It</p>

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41352:10"/>is proved by the common Action, of which beneath.</p>
               <p>The Uſe [according to <hi>Riolanus,</hi> who ſaith that the <hi>Os pubis</hi> or Share-bone being moveable, doth move this boney ſtructure forwards, the Cheſt reſting, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lightly moved, in the Conjugal Embracement, and in the going of ſuch as want Leggs and Thighs. But we daily obſerve the Belly to be moved, in ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are chaſt, nor doth Nature frame Parts to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unexpected defects of muſcles, but for Natural and Ordinary Actions. <hi>Spigelius</hi> ſuſpects, that from the ſame moveable beginning, that ſame bone is drawn obliquely upward, and enclined toward the Cheſt, by the help of the muſcles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond pare</hi> is the OBLIQUELY ASCENDENT [or internal] having Fibres contrarily ſituated: It is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated next the former, and hath a triangular Figure.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Original</hi> is fleſhy, from the Rib of <hi>Os Ilij:</hi> but membranous, both<note place="margin">The Original of the obliquely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> from the tranſverſe Proceſſes of the Vertebra's of the Loins, from which it receives Nerves, and from the ſharp points of <hi>Os ſacrum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It grows a little by a fleſhy End, to<note place="margin">Their double End.</note> each of the baſtard Ribs, and to ſome of the true Ribs, but the reſt its End turns by little and little into a Tendon, which is double: The one part goes upon the right muſcles, the other beneath, ſo that the right doth reſt as it were in a ſheath, but near the white Line it is reunited, and inſerted thereinto. Which <hi>Riolanus</hi> hath obſerved to happen only above the Navil, and not beneath.</p>
               <p>The third pare of the <hi>right Muſcles,</hi> by reaſon of the right fibres. This pare is commonly reckoned to be but one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> doth rightly make the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be fleſhy, ariſing from the<note place="margin">The Original of the right Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> Breaſt-bone, on each ſide of the Sword-faſhion'd Griſtle, and from the Griſtles of the four baſtard Ribs. It <hi>ends</hi> in a Tendon at the <hi>Os Pubis.</hi> Others contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, will have the beginning to be here in the Share<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, and the End above. But I anſwer. 1. That the right Muſcles receive their Nerves in the upper part, viz. one branch of thoſe Nerves, which were inſerted into the oblique deſcending Muſcle, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo from the laſt of the Back, and from the firſt pare of the Loins. 2. A Muſcle uſes not to have a tendinous beginning, and a fleſhy End. Other late Anatomiſts will have the right Muſcles to have two beginnings and two ends; one beginning and one end in the Breaſt, and another in the Share-bones. Who are for this Conceit of theirs, beholden to that new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion touching the moveableneſs of the Share-bone, of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſculus rectus</hi> or ſtraight muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, hath for the moſt part three. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions<note place="margin">That there are divers right Muſcles.</note> in Perſons of a middle ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſomtimes four in tall people, whoſe Belly is long. But according to <hi>Carpus</hi> and <hi>Caſſerius,</hi> we ſay that ſuitable to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Inſcriptions, there are more muſcles, becauſe 1. To every Joynting there comes a Nerve. 2. If it were but one, being contracted into itſelf, it could not equally compreſs all parts. 3. There ſhould be no ſuch muſcle in the whole body, wherein nevertheleſs there are many long ones, without ſuch a number of Inſcriptions.</p>
               <p>In the internal Surface of the right muſcles, there are <hi>two Veins</hi> conjoyned, with as many Arteries.</p>
               <p>The <hi>upper</hi> called <hi>Mammaria,</hi> ariſe from the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> lying beneath the<note place="margin">The Veins.</note> Claves, the more remarkeable branch whereof reaches unto the Duggs, and runs out under the right Muſcle, as far as to the Region of the Navil, where it is terminated.</p>
               <p>This is met by the other termed <hi>Epigaſtrica,</hi> which in Women ſprings from the Womb, in men the <hi>Vena cava</hi> goes upwards towards the upper Vein, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it touches, it is for the moſt part obliterated. Yet theſe two Veins are ſomtimes joyned together by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Anaſtomoſis, touching one another, at their ends. Hence the Conſent is ſuppoſed to ariſe between the Duggs and the Womb, the Belly and the Noſtrils. For when the Noſe bleeds, we fix Cupping-glaſſes to the belly, and the Duggs of Women being handled, it in cites them to Venery.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſculi recti</hi> receive <hi>Arteries</hi> from the Epigaſtrica Artery, and <hi>Nerves</hi> which<note place="margin">The Arteries and Nerves.</note> proceed from the laſt Vertebra's of the Cheſt.</p>
               <p>The proper uſe of theſe Muſcles according to <hi>Riola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> is to move the Share-bone forward in Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hath been already confuted. <hi>Spigelius</hi> will have them to draw the Breaſt to the <hi>Oſſa pubis</hi> or ſhare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones, and the Share-bones to the Breaſt, in a ſtraight motion, and ſo to bend the Cheſt; whence it is, that in Dogs and Apes, they reach as far as to the <hi>Jugulum,</hi> becauſe their Cheſt did require very much bowing. But theſe contrary motions, unleſs they be holpen, with thoſe inciſions of the right muſcles, do involve a difficulty. <hi>Helmont</hi> ſuſpects that they are ſtretched in going up hill, and that from thence ſhortneſs of breath proceeds. <hi>Flud</hi> ſaith, that by a general uſe, they make the Belly round, and compreſs it centrally, or towards the middle point thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth pare</hi> called the <hi>Pyramidal</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Pyramidal Muſcles.</note> Muſcles, do reſt upon the lower Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons of the <hi>Muſculi recti.</hi> Nor are they parts of the right Muſcles, as <hi>Veſalius</hi> and <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> think; but diſtinct muſcles, as <hi>Fallopius</hi> proves with reaſons, which are partly convincing, partly vain. But that they are peculiar muſcles is hence apparent. 1 Becauſe they are cloathed with a peculiar membrane. 2. Their Fibres are different from thoſe of the <hi>Muſculi recti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They riſe</hi> with a fleſhy beginning,<note place="margin">Their Original.</note> not very broad, from the external Share-bone, where alſo the Nerves do enter; and the farther they go upwards, the narrower they grow, till they terminate with a ſharp point, into the Tendon of the tranſverſe Muſcle. And from this place I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved more then once, a ſmall and round Tendon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as far as to the Navil.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Galen,</hi> was eaſily hurt by cold, and therefore he alwaies covered his Belly with Wool.

               <p>THe Stomach called <hi>Ventriculus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Stomach, why called Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triculus?</note> that is a little Belly, is an Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical part ſeated in the lower Belly, juſt under the Midriff, being the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument that makes Chyle. <hi>Paraeus</hi> obſerves that it hath through a Wound in the Midriff aſcended into the Cheſt, and gone downwards by reaſon of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Call. But Naturally;</p>
               <p>It is <hi>ſeated</hi> in the Epigaſtrium, a place encompaſſed with no Bones, that it<note place="margin">Its Situation.</note> might ſtretch more eaſily, juſt under the Midriff, as it were in the middle of the Body, and it reſts upon the Back-bone: Now its left ſide which is the greater and rounder in the bottom, lies in the left Hypochondrium, to give way to the Liver which lies on the right ſide, and that ſo the Body may be equally as it were poiſed, and ballanced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or trimmed, as the Watermen ſpeak of their boats: Towards the right hand it grows ſmall by little and little, that the meat may be gradually thruſt thither. Whence we gather that it is better for ſuch as lie down to ſleep, to lie firſt upon their left ſide till the Digeſtion be finiſhed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards upon their right, otherwiſe then is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagined. But in the left ſide there is the bottom, where the meat ought to tarry, for being rowled to the right ſide, it is nearer paſſing out. Howbeit in this caſe, much muſt be allowed to Cuſtom.</p>
               <p>'Tis only one in <hi>Number</hi> in man, and ſuch live Creatures as have teeth in both<note place="margin">The Number of Stomachs in feathered Fowle.</note> their Jaws. <hi>Riolanus</hi> bath twice obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a double Stomach in a man, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, but diſtinguiſhed by a narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out of one into another. <hi>Sperlinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> ſaw the ſame in a Woman of <hi>Wittemberg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montius</hi> ſaw a bag full of ſtones which grew to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. Yea, and that it hath been double in one that chewed the Cud, as <hi>Salmuth</hi> relates and others, is not to be doubted. In ſome Fowls there are two Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, the one membranous, which the Latins term <hi>Ingluvies</hi> the Crap, which only receives the meat, that from thence being lightly digeſted, they may caſt it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mouths of their young ones, whereas otherwiſe young Birds could not be nouriſhed. The other is very fleſhy and hotter, having within a hard Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, wherein hard meat is received. <hi>Petrus Caſtellus</hi> a rare man, adds a third, which is in like manner fleſhy. In Beaſts that chew the Cud, and have Hornes, and teeth only in one Jaw<note place="margin">In Beaſts that chew the Cud.</note> there are four; The firſt <hi>Venter,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulum,</hi> the <hi>Omaſus,</hi> and the <hi>Abomaſus;</hi> of which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks. The <hi>Venter</hi> and the <hi>Reticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> which is a part thereof, are ordained to hold the crude meat; The <hi>Omaſus</hi> receives the Food immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the mouth, if it be thin, if thick, it is firſt chewed, and from hence after a ſhort ſtay, it ſlips into the <hi>Abomaſus.</hi> Now chewing the Cud, is a ſecond chewing of the meat in the mouth, for the more perfect Digeſtion thereof, whence the Aliment proves excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and for that cauſe among the Jews, ſuch as chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cud were counted clean Beaſts. Chewing the Cud is cauſed, not as ſome think, becauſe the meat in the firſt Stomach gains ſuch a quality, that it provokes the Stomach to caſt it up; for ſo in every ſharp biting of the Stomach, and in all Animals chewing the Cud, would happen againſt their Wills: but it depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the voluntary Action of the Stomach, which by a ſingular membrane, expels what it pleaſes, and when it pleaſes; as that ſome Toſspot of <hi>Malta,</hi> whom I have ſeen, would as he pleaſed caſt up what ever he had drunk; and others will ſwallow down the Smoak of Tobacco, and turn it out again. In great Sea-fiſhes I have obſerved a threefold Stomach, as in a Porpice and others; but it grew ſo together, that there was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three diſtinct Cavities with paſſages from one to another, three perfect Stomachs.</p>
               <p>It hath <hi>two Orifices,</hi> and both of them in the upper Region of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.<note place="margin">Its Orifices. The Symptoms of the Stomachs, Mouth, and why like Heart-paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</note>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>left</hi> is commonly called the upper Orifice, and ſomtimes ſingly the mouth of the Stomach, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tis termed the Stomach, becauſe of its largeneſs; the Ancients did cal it <hi>Cor</hi> the Heart, becauſe the Diſeaſes thereof cauſed fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other Symptoms like thoſe which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ſuch as are troubled with Paſſions of the Heart; alſo becauſe of its moſt exquiſite ſenſe, and becauſe the Heart doth ſympathize therewith, both in regard of its nearneſs, and they have Nerves proceeding from the ſame Branch. This Orifice <hi>is greater,</hi> thicker, and larger, ſo that it may admit hard or half chewed meat. <hi>Tis ſituate</hi> at the eleventh Vertebra of the Cheſt: It hath circular fleſhy Fibres, that it may by Natural Inſtinct ſhut up the mouth of the Stomach, after the meat is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in, leaſt fumes ſhould ariſe, and go into the Brain, and breed Diſeaſes; and that ſo Digeſtion may be more perfectly accompliſhed. So we cover it as we do our Seething-pots with a potlid, to keep in the Fumes, and to hinder the meat from falling back into our mouths, when we lie in bed, and tumble this way and that way. Through this Orifice, meats and drinks are received in. And it is but in the Epigaſtrick Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it is more near the Back-bone, then the ſword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhion'd Griſtle or <hi>Cartilago Enſiformis:</hi> And therefore when it is diſeaſed, we apply Epithems rather behind then before. <hi>Helmont</hi> places the ſeat of the Soul, and the Principle of life<note place="margin">Whether the Soul be ſeated in the Orifice of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach?</note> in the Stomach, as it were in its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral point, ſo that it governes and rules over the Head and principal Faculties. If you aske him more particularly where it is placed, he will anſwer you that it is there after an exorbitant manner, centrally in a point, and as it were in the middle of an Atome of the thickneſs of one Membrane. But the Stomach cannot be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41352:13"/>
the Seat of the Soul, becauſe. 1. It is alwaies full of impure meats. 2. No Faculties flow to us from thence. 3. Great Feeders and perſons of large Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, ſhould have more Soul then other people. 4. The Soul is not fixed to any Centre. 5. When the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is hurt, death doth not preſently follow, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in him that ſwallowed the knife. And any dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage happen, it is by reaſon of the Nearneſs of the Heart, and Community of Nerves, and conſequently by accident. For the Soul ſticks not in the Nerves primarily; but there rather from whence the Nerves have their Original<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is a common Membrane. Yet in a large ſenſe, it may be called the Principle of Life, becauſe there is the Seat of Appetite, and the firſt Reception and Digeſtion of Aliments, whoſe fault in the following Concoctions, is never amended. Now it rules over the Head, by reaſon of the Conſent of the Membranes, and the moſt undoubted ariſing of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors.</p>
               <p>The <hi>right Orifice,</hi> commonly called the lower, is as far from the bottom,<note place="margin">The right Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, called Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorus.</note> well near, as the left: It is narrower, and abides ſhut until the Digeſtion of the meat be finiſhed, that is to ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the meat be turned into a liquid Cream, or Poſſet as irwere. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit<note place="margin">It is opened in the Diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chylus.</note> 
                  <hi>Walaeus</hi> hath obſerved, that it may and doth let out the more liquid meats, and ſuch as are of eaſie Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by peicemeal before the reſt, which may eaſily be done by opening it ſelf a little way, ſo that the thicker and undigeſted meats cannot paſs through, as <hi>Riolanus</hi> objects, ſeeing they cannot paſs through a narrow chink: This <hi>Walaeus</hi> I ſay obſerved in his Diſſertion of Living Creatures. <hi>Helmont</hi> affirms that in Vomiting, it is ſhut upwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note place="margin">It is ſhut ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting.</note> the Pylorus, becauſe it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to Health, that the faculent matter of Vomits ſhould paſs down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.

And the truth is, that it is alſo open to noxious Humors, <hi>Lienteries</hi> doth witneſs, and other fluxes of the Belly, <hi>Miſerere mei,</hi> and other Diſeaſes, which paſs and repaſs through the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorus.

how that very great things have been ſwallowed down, and voided out by Vomit, and by Stool; as Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, Nut-ſhels, ſmall Knives, Pebble-ſtones, peices of Iron, Frogs, Lizards, Serpents, whole Eels, Pipes, Coins, &amp;c.

               <p>The ſtomach hath three ſorts of <hi>Fibres:</hi> ſtraight, oblique, &amp; tranſverſe; which are<note place="margin">The Fibres of the Stomach and their uſe.</note> conceived to ſerve for Attraction, Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Expulſion. But ſome do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure more rightly determine, that the Fibres conduce to firmneſs and ſtrength, as when we would have a peice of Cloath ſtrong, we cauſe more threeds to be woven into it: Eſpecially ſeeing many other parts, without theſe kind of Fibres do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, retain, and expel; as the Liver, Spleen, Brain, Stones, Lungs, Duggs. And other parts, as Bones and Griſtles, though they have Fibres, yet do they not attract or expel any thing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Number of Fibres</hi> in the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes is uncertain, through the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance<note place="margin">Their Number.</note> of Authors. That the firſt or outmoſt Coat hath more right Fibres, and the ſecond more tranſverſe, is generally agreed upon by moſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomiſts. The doubt is touching the third or inner Coat. <hi>Galen, Abenſina, Mundinus, Sylvus,</hi> and <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendens,</hi> do allow it only right or ſtraight Fibres. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalius</hi> ſaies it hath right Fibres towards the Cavity, and oblique in the outward part. <hi>Coſtaeus</hi> allows it only oblique. I with <hi>Fallopius</hi> and <hi>Laurentius,</hi> being led by Experience and Reaſon, do admit al kinds of Fibres in this Membrane.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surface</hi> is ſmooth without, plain and whiteiſh within, when the ſtomach<note place="margin">The Surface.</note> doth purſe it ſelf, it appears wrinkled and ſomwhat reddiſh.</p>
               <p>It hath a triple <hi>Membrane:</hi> The firſt<note place="margin">The Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes.</note> common and external, ſpringing from the Peritonaeum, and the thickeſt of all that have their Original from the Peritonaeum, though otherwiſe thin enough; which <hi>Petrus Caſtellus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives doth chiefly concurre in Vomiting.

                  </gap> ungrateful to the Stomach, and becauſe the meat is prepared in the mouth. Hence it is, that when Choler is in the Stomach, the Tongue is bitter and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: And contrariwiſe the Diſeaſes of the Mouth and Tongue are communicated to the Oeſophagus and Sromach. This <hi>Coat</hi> is <hi>wrinkled,</hi> that it may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dilated. And it hath its Wrinkles from a fleſhy Cruſtineſs ſticking thereunto, the better to defend it from hard meats. This <hi>Cruſt</hi> is thought to ariſe from the Excrements of the<note place="margin">The Cruſtineſs in the ſtomach whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds?</note> third Concoction of the Stomach: and it is ſpungy, and hath paſſages like ſhort Fibres, from the inner Surface to the outward; that the thinner Chylus may be the better detained till the End of Digeſtion.</p>
               <p>The Subſtance therefore of the Stomach being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous and cold, is holpen by the Heat of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Parts. For the Liver lies over the right ſide, and middle part thereof; for it lies under the Heart-pit: At the left ſide lies the Spleen; it is covered by the fat Call: Under it lies the Pancreas or Sweet-bread; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo near it lie the Midriff, Colon-gut, the Trunk of <hi>Vena cava,</hi> and of the Aorta.</p>
               <p>The Stomach is knit in the left part<note place="margin">Its Connexion.</note> to the Midriff (not to the Back-bone) by its Orifice; therefore when it is over full, by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the motion of the Midriff, it cauſes ſhortneſs of breath: On the right ſide it is joyned to the Gut Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum, by its other Orifice or the Pylorus.</p>
               <p>At the Stomach, in the left ſide, under the Midriff, is formed a remarkeable <hi>Cavity</hi> encloſod with Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, partly from the Stomach, partly from the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, and partly from the Call. Tonching this Cavity, that place of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is to be underſtood in the 54 Aphoriſm of the 7. Section. <hi>Thoſe who have Flegm ſhut up between the Septum tranſverſum and the Stomach, which cauſes pain, and can find no paſſage into either of the Bellies, when the Flegm paſſes through the Veins into the Bladder, their Diſeaſe is cured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Shape</hi> of the Stomach is round and<note place="margin">Shape.</note> oblong, like a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bag-pipe, eſpecially if you conſider it together with the Duodenum and Oeſopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus. In the Fore-part is is equally gibbous or bunch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth; in the Hinder-part, while it lies encloſed in the Body, it hath two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bunchings, that on the right hand being the leſs, and that on the left hand the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, between which lie the Vertebra's of the Back, and the deſcending Trunk of the <hi>Vena cava</hi> and the Artery.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Magnitude</hi> varies; commonly tis leſs in Women then in Men, that<note place="margin">Its Magnitude.</note> place may be made for the Womb when it ſwells. For Women are for the moſt part leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then men, and yet not more gluttonous then Men, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> beleives, viz. being of the ſame ſize and equally healthy; yea, and they are inferior to men in Heat to digeſt and concoct. Alſo in gluttonous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and great Drinkers, it is greater then ordinary, ſo that when it ſwells, it may be felt as it were naked. For it is exceedingly dilated, and therefore it is thinner in Drinkers, in whom it is ſomtimes ſo attenuated, that it can no more wrinkle it ſelf, whence follows long weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Which <hi>Walaeus</hi> in Diffection hath obſerved to happen chiefly to thoſe old men, whoſe Stomachs in time of Concoction do breed Wind; which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo in gluttonous perſons, takes up more room then their meat. <hi>Columbus</hi> will have it, when it is ſtretched, to reach as low as the Navil, and <hi>Archange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> will have it to reach further, when it is over ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but being contracted and wrinkled in ſuch as live ſoberly, it is thick, and lies hid under the Liver. Now the Largeneſs of the Stomach is known. 1. By the Greatneſs of the Mouth, for thoſe that have large Mouths, are great Eaters, but withal bold and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous. 2. If from the <hi>Cartilago Enſiformis</hi> to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the ſpace is greater, then that of the Face or Breaſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>weight</hi> of the Stomach being dryed with the Oeſophagus, according to the Obſervation of <hi>Loſelius</hi> is two ounces and two drams; wherein notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I have found a variety, according to the diverſity of ſubjects.</p>
               <p>It receives very many <hi>Veſſels. Veins,</hi> as from the Spleen <hi>Vas breve,</hi> which is inferted,<note place="margin">Veſſels.</note> not into the mouth but into the bottom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and there inſinuating it ſelf into the tunicles, it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41352:14"/>
creeps upwards between them, towards the Orifice: but before it reaches the ſame, it is obliterated; in ſome it is not viſible, becauſe of its ſmalneſs, in ſome it is quite abſent [and therefore peradventure thoſe perſons have no good Concoction, or Nature Recompences that defect with other Arteries] in others I have ſeen it flouriſhing, with manyfold branches. And becauſe it is implanted into the bottom of the ſtomach, and blood emptied there, cannot provoke Appetite, as many imagine. Others will have it that a Melancholick Excrement which<note place="margin">Whether blood caſt out of the Spleen help Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</note> could not be changed in the Spleen, is by this Veſſel brought into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, that by its harſh and acid facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it might further the ſtomachs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and make the meats abide therein, a convenient ſeaſon. But Concoction ſhould rather be hindred, by the caſting in of a ſtrange Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious Humor. If we ſhall interpret it touching an acid fermenting juyce, the Opinion will be truer, which kind of juyce, can come from no other place but the Spleen. For according to the Obſervation of <hi>Walaeus,</hi> the Spleen, eſpecially of a Sow, being boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and eaten, as coming neareſt that of a man, doth wont to help the heavyneſs and dullneſs of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. Hence ſharp things are pleaſing to the Spleen, and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> gives Vinegar to Spleenetick perſons, and <hi>Celſus</hi> makes a Cataplaſm for the Spleen tempered with the ſharpeſt Vinegar. Moreover <hi>Riolanus</hi> hath found the left ſide of the inner part of the Stomach blacker then the right. <hi>Others</hi> ſuppoſe that nothing is carried into the ſtomach by the <hi>Vas breve,</hi> but that ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what is carried out of the ſtomach into the Spleen; whether it be the thinner part of the Chyle, as <hi>Conrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, Horſtius,</hi> and <hi>Regius</hi> prove, or Blood as <hi>Hogeland</hi> conceives; they being informed by Ligature in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections of live Creatures: of which hereafter.</p>
               <p>Moreover the ſtomach receives Veins from Vena Portae, viz. the Pyloric, Gaſtric, and Gaſtroepiploic branches left and right.</p>
               <p>There is one notable Vein called <hi>Gaſtrica,</hi> which creeps a long the bottom of the ſtomach, but doth not quite touch it leaſt the ſtomach being very much ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, it ſhould be in danger to be broken; but it ſpreds many branches to the ſtomach: which <hi>Picolhomineus</hi> and <hi>Aquapendent</hi> will have to ſuck out the more thin and ſubtile part of the Chyle, before it paſſes out of the ſtomach to the Liver. And this Opinion ſeems prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. 1. Becauſe otherwiſe no reaſon can be given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſo ſudden a paſſage, ſeeing they who have drunk much, do preſently Piſs it out plentifully. 2. Otherwiſe the ſtomach would be ready to burſt, when it is overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. 3. Thence it comes, that ſtrength is ſo ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by fragrant Wine, broaths, and other comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things.</p>
               <p>In ſome Men a part of the Choler paſſage, is inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the bottom of the ſtomach, by which our Country-men <hi>Petrus Severinus,</hi> would have choler to be carried into the ſtomach. But this is an Error of Nature, and therefore ſuch perſons are apt to vomit Choler, for they are exceeding Cholerick, ſuch as <hi>Galen, Veſalius, Fernelius,</hi> and <hi>Caſſerius</hi> have obſerved. Such perſons are ſaid to be <hi>Picrocholoi ano,</hi> vomiters of Choler.</p>
               <p>The ſtomach receives <hi>Arteries</hi> from me <hi>Caeliaca Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> which accompany the Veins, not only for lifes ſake, but that blood may be ſupplied from the Heart, for nouriſhment, for that the ſtomach ſhould be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with Chyle, is a falſe opinion and now out of date. Seeing it is nouriſhed with blood, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of other parts (it is only delighted with the chyle) whichis brought out of the Arteries; which blood flows back again to the Heart, according to the Doctrine of Circulation proved and aſſerted by the renowned <hi>Walaeus</hi> in his Epiſtles. By the Splenic Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries an acid ſharp juyce is conveighed into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach from the Spleen, as the ſaid <hi>Waloeus</hi> and <hi>Hoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> conceive, which I grant when there is no <hi>Vas breve,</hi> or in abſence of the Spleen, wherein I eaſily conſent with <hi>Riolanus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo it hath <hi>Nerves</hi> from the ſixt pair,<note place="margin">Its Nerves.</note> viz. a couple in its Orifice, from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach branches, being produced after it hath run back in the Cheſt and furniſhed the Lungs and Pericardium; which becauſe they are ſoft and go a great way, they are covered with ſtrong Membranes. And they do ſo croſs one another, that they are carried obliquely and conſequently with greater ſafety. The right branch compaſſes the fore and left part of the mouth of the ſtomach; the left the hinder and right part thereof. And therefore becauſe the Orifice is ſo compaſſed with Nerves, as if it were altogether compoſed of Nerves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thence it is that this Orifice of the ſtomach is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſenſible; for there was to be the ſeat of Appetite and hunger: even as thoſe that are very hungry, do feel that part to be as it were contracted and wrinkled together. Alſo branches of Nerves are ſent from theſe downwards to the very bottom. A branch goes from the left Nerve, a long the upper part of the ſtomach to the Pylorus, which it infolds with certain branches, and goes to the hollow of the Liver. Other two Nerves alſo go unto the bottom of the Stomach, from the branches which run along by the Roots of the Ribs. And therefore it is no wonder, that when the Brain is ſmitten and hurt, the Stomach is diſturbed, and falls a vomiting, eſpecially in the pain called <hi>Hemicranea:</hi> As alſo that when the Stomach is miſaffected, the Animal Faculty languiſhes.</p>
               <p>In the Stomach <hi>Fermentation</hi> of the Meats goes before Concoction, which<note place="margin">The Stomachs Fermentation.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> inculcates in his book <hi>de Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſca Medicina.</hi> Becauſe hard things ought to be broken to peices; and thick things as bones and ſhells, &amp;c. in the ſtomachs of Beaſts, ſeem impoſſible to be melted by the natural heat alone, unleſs ſomwhat elſe do cut them in peices. This labor <hi>Petrus Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> attributes to Choler, which nevertheleſs according to the ordinary Courſe of Nature is not found in the ſtomach, nor does it diſſolve any hard meat, though Painters uſe to temper their colours. <hi>De la Chambre</hi> attributes it to Spirits, without which it can hardly be performed, <hi>Riolanus</hi> ſuppoſes that it proceeds from the Reliques of the Chyle, which have attained a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting faculty; it concurs indeed, for a fermentative quality may be communicated to any thing: but we muſt come to ſome firſt, thing, by which the Chylus is fermented, and from whence the ferment of the firſt meat was derived, before the Reliques of the Chyle could ariſe. The <hi>greater part of Doctors</hi> do attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this whol work to Melancholy, which is carried by the <hi>Vas breve</hi> into the ſtomach, and of which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick perſons, who are otherwiſe no good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſters, do often complain by reaſon of its ſharp taſt. Which Melancholy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it be underſtood of the acid juyce, it may be allowed. For any acid or ſharp things taken in, as Vinegar, and Meats ſteeped there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, Juyce of Citrons, Oyl of Sulphure or Vitriol, Cream of Tartar, and the like, do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

doth, and the acidity of Vitriol ferments Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and ſour leven makes the bread ariſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Johannes Walaeus</hi> requires three things to Concoction, firſt ſome<note place="margin">Three things requiſite to Concoction,</note> moiſture to temper the meat and make it liquid, viz. Drink and Spittle; in the next place, ſomwhat to cut and mince it as it were, as the thin ſharp humor, and laſtly ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to melt and make liquid that which is cut, ſuch as is heat, wherewith in ravenous beaſts and ſome Men, the chyle is made fluid, though they do not alwaies drink, I ſhould not doubt, but that the Excrements of the third Concoction, ſticking to the Cruſt, as being ſtill impraegnated with the virtue of the parts nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do give ſome aſſiſtance to the Concoction, which when they are fretted of, is impared, and ſo in long faſting men are not ſo able to digeſt: And that the ſpittle beſides moiſtening and tempering the meats, doth perform ſome other more noble work in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, viz. prepares the meat in the mouth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it comes to change its ſmels; and heals Tetters, and either kills or chaſes away Scorpions and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>But what becomes of that acid Juyce, when it hath performed its office of fermentation? <hi>H. Regius</hi> beleives that it remaines after the expulſion of the Chylus, to prick the ſtomach and provoke Appetite. But hunger is raiſed in the ſenſible mouth of the ſtomach, and not in the bottom thereof, where this acid juyce is; alſo there would be hunger after the ſtomach is full. I ſhould think that it is expelled with the Chyle, and that then it is either therewith turned into blood, or that in obſtructions of the Meſentery, it goes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and raiſes diſturbance.</p>
               <p>The Action of the ſtomach is <hi>Coction</hi> which is termed Chylification. For the<note place="margin">Concoction is the Stomachs Act.</note> ſtomach is the Organ of the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, the beginning and preparation of which Concoction is performed in the mouth, the middle in the bottom of the Stomach, and the Concluſion in the ſmal Guts. Now this Concoction is performed by heat, not<note place="margin">How it is made.</note> of the ſtomach only, but alſo of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts; as alſo by a faculty which is naturally bred in the ſtomach of every Animal. Now it turnes the meats into a white Chylus or Juyce, of a like ſubſtance, whiles both its Oriſices being ſhut very well, it contracts it ſelf, and cloſely embraces the food. But touching the whole manner of Concoction ſee the forecited Epiſtles of <hi>Walaeus.</hi>

Their length, for the moſt part doth exceed the length of the perſon whoſe they are ſix times, little more or leſs. <hi>Picolhomineus</hi> ſaies they are a foot and half ſhorter; they are reckoned to be ſeven times as long by <hi>Laurentius, Paraeus</hi> and <hi>Riolanus,</hi> and before them by <hi>Celſus,</hi> who nevertheleſs began to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from the <hi>Oeſophagus.

               <p>Concoction of the Guts. 1. That the Mouths of the Meſaraick Veins may not be ſtopped. 2. That neither they nor the inner Coat might be made hard and callous, by the continual thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Chylus. Alſo the ſecond is proper, and the middle moſt, being ſtrong and furniſhed with fleſhy Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres. The <hi>third</hi> is common and external, being bred immediately of the Membranes of the Meſenterium [ſave that where the Duodenum and Colon cleave to the Stomach, it ariſes from the lower Membrane of the Call] but mediately from the Peritonaeum. Of theſe two proper Membranes, the inner is often hurt in a Dyſentery or bloody Flux, that other remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt.</p>
               <p>They have <hi>Fibres.</hi> not only tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, as is commonly conceived, but of<note place="margin">Their Fibres.</note> all kinds: The innermoſt hath oblique ones. the middlemoſt hath tranſverſe ones. The right Fibres which are allotted for the ſafeguard of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ones, are fewer in the thin or ſmall Guts, more in the large, eſpecially the right or the laſt Gut, which was to be ſtrong, becauſe it did collect hard Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The Guts are covered on the outſide with <hi>Fat,</hi> on the inſide with a ſlimy ſnotty Subſtance, that the Dung may thereby paſs more freely, and that the Guts may be duller in point of feeling.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Veſſels</hi> they have the <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> or milkie Veins, which are chiefly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed<note place="margin">Their Veſſels.</note> between the common and proper Membranes, which carry the Chyle to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and others from the <hi>Vena Portae,</hi> which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to bring Blood for Nouriſhment, but they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carry back to the Liver the Blood which remains after the Guts have received their Nouriſhment. They have alſo Arteries from the Caeliaca for life, which by their motion preſerve from purrefaction, but eſpecially to bring Nouriſhment from the Spleen to the Guts, which wanted ſuch kind of ſuſtenance. They have <hi>Nerves</hi> from the ſixt pare of Nerves. But <hi>Walaeus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that the Guts have ſuch great plenty of Arteries and Veins. 1. That Excrements might be conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the common ſhore, which are contained in the Veſſels, whence the Child in the Womb, though it take
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41352:16"/>
no meat in at the mouth, yet hath it Excrements in the Guts. 2. That greater plenty of Blood might be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through the <hi>Vena portae</hi> and the Liver, and might come to be perfected by the Liver.</p>
               <p>All the Guts are commonly <hi>divided,</hi> into the <hi>thin,</hi> or <hi>ſmall,</hi> and the <hi>thick,</hi> or<note place="margin">Difference of the Guts.</note> large Guts. For though they make one continued Channel from the Pylorus to the Fundament: Yet becauſe this paſſage doth vary, in Magnitude, Number of Turnings, Subſtance, Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Figure, and Office, therefore is it diſtinguiſhed into divers Guts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>thin</hi> or ſmall Guts, ſo called by<note place="margin">Whether the thin Guts may be right ſaid to be uppermoſt?</note> reaſon of the thinneſs of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, are ſituate partly above, partly beneath the Navil; and therefore they poſſeſs both the Umbilical Region and Hypogaſtrium, which is not ſo in Dogs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Ancients</hi> taking Example from Dogs, called the upper Guts thin, the lower thick: which is falſe in Mankind. For a Man hath more of the thick Guts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Navil, and more of the thin Guts beneath; ſeeing that which is the longeſt, is beneath; and the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junum which is ſhort is above. And therefore all the ſmall Guts are in the middle Region about the Navil. 1. Becauſe they are the more noble. 2. That they may be the more near to the Centre of the Meſenterie, and conſequently receive Veins and Arteries immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the Meſenterie, and quickly conveigh the Blood to the Liver. Now the ſmall Guts are three: Duodenum, Jejunum, and Ileon. And theſe perfect and diſtribute the Chyle: In as much as by reaſon of their narrowneſs, every part of the Chylus may be touched, by their Coat and Veſſels. This Diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is holpen by the inbred Periſtaltick motion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Guts are contracted from the upper part down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Craſſa Inteſtina</hi> or thick Guts,<note place="margin">The thick Guts.</note> are ſo called, becauſe they have thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Coats; they contain the thick part of the Chyle: And are made to collect, and for a ſeaſon retain the Dung. And they are three; Caecum, Colon, and Rectum. And they are ſituate by the ſides of the ſmall Guts, which they wall about as it were, that they might give way to the thin Guts, and that the thin Guts might not be oppreſſed by the thick.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of all the Guts is, to be like<note place="margin">Their Uſe.</note> the Earth, out of which the Meſaraick Veins ſuck Blood, and the <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> or milkie Veins ſuck Chyle. And the <hi>uſe</hi> of the <hi>thin Guts</hi> is, to concoct the Chylus yet more in the paſſage, and to diſtribute the ſame. Of the <hi>thick Guts</hi> to contain the Excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Reliques of the Chyle. viz. the Dung; alſo Winds and Choler proceeding from the Liver. A <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary uſe</hi> of the Guts being dried, is to cure pains of the Cholick, and other Diſeaſes of the Guts; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preternaturally depraved, to contain ſeveral ſorts of Worms, and Duggs, and Stones; alſo variouſly to be affected, of which Phyſitians are wont to treat.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Guts in Particular.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>firſt</hi> thin Gut, under which<note place="margin">The Gut Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum.</note> the Sweet-bread lies, eſpecially in Dogs, is called DUODENUM. <hi>Galen</hi> terms it <hi>Ecphiſis, Herophilus, Dodecadactylon,</hi> as if it were juſt twelve fingers long; though in the daies and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of ours, it is not found ſo long; nay it is hardly four fingers long, unleſs men are grown leſs of ſtature then they were anciently, which is not credible. Nor can we underſtand the fingers breath, of which this Gut hardly attains to eight, unleſs peradventure the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did alſo comprehend the Pylorus in ther meſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
               <p>It <hi>proceeds</hi> in the right ſide, from the Pylorus towards the Back-bone, or under the Stomach, where being joyned to the Vertebra's of the Loins, by membranous Ligaments, it defends right along, without any Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolution, and is <hi>terminated,</hi> where the Windings and Wreathings begin.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>thicker</hi> then the reſt of the thin Guts; but hath a more narrow Cavity, leaſt the Chylus ſhould ſlip in too faſt. I ſaw a large one at <hi>Padua,</hi> and <hi>Aquapendent</hi> deſcribes ſuch another being puffed with Wind, ſuch as that was, mentioned by <hi>Trafelman,</hi> which had in it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Stones as big as Nutmegs, of an Aſh-color.</p>
               <p>It hath <hi>two Holes</hi> beneath, towards the Gut Jejunum; the one being the<note place="margin">The Holes of the ſaid Gut.</note> outlet of the Exoler or Gall-carrying paſſage, which is the reaſon we find it yellow in our Diſſections, the other is the new paſſage of the Pancreas or Sweet-bread, invented by <hi>Wirſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus;</hi> which I have notwithſtanding ſometimes ſeen grow together, and joyned with one only Mouth.</p>
               <p>Its peculiar <hi>Uſe</hi> aſſigned by <hi>Helmont,</hi> is to change the acid Cream brought out of the Stomach, forthwith into a brackiſh Salt.</p>
               <p>It hath a proper <hi>Vein</hi> called <hi>Vena duodena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath an <hi>Artery</hi> from the right Branch of the Caeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aca.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is called JEJUNUM, becauſe for the moſt part it is more empty then<note place="margin">The Gut Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junum.</note> the reſt, eſpecially in Diſſections. 1. By reaſon of the plenty and greatneſs of the Meſaraicks [the milkie Veins] which in that place are as it were infinite, and do preſently ſuck out of the greateſt part of the Chyle. 2. By reaſon of the moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Chyle paſſing through. 3. By reaſon of the nearneſs of the Liver. 4. By reaſon of the Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Choler. For the cholerick or Gall-paſſage, enters in at the beginning of this Gut, or at the End of the Duodenum, bringing Choler from the Liver to provoke Expulſion.</p>
               <p>Its inner Membrane is longer then the Outer, and therefore it is wrinkled into Foles, the better to ſtop the Chyle, ſlipping by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Riolanus</hi> falſly ſaies that Women have no Jejunum Inteſtinum, being deceived by thoſe, who either were dull-ſighted, or finding this Gut filled, thought it could not be the Jejunum. <hi>Laurentius</hi> obſerves, that it appears ſomwhat reddiſh, by reaſon of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood of the Liver.</p>
               <p>It hath <hi>Veins</hi> from the <hi>Meſenterica dextra,</hi> which are common to the reſt of the Guts, excepting the laſt, or <hi>rectum Inteſtinum,</hi> the ſtraight Gut.</p>
               <p>It hath <hi>Arteries</hi> from the upper Meſenterick Artery.</p>

The Gut cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, or the blind Gut.</note> perſons grown up, howbeit in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant in the Womb, it is ſaid to receive the Excrements. <hi>Knobleth</hi> indeed ſaith that it hath a double Orifice, ſevered with a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous Partition, that by one it may receive from the Ileon, and by the other deliver into the Colon; but we have not yet found this in any man, in whom one and the ſame Orifice takes in and gives out. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath only one Hole, whence it is alſo called <hi>Monocolon.</hi> For it is a little Appendix like a long Worm, which ariſing from the beginning of Colon, and the End of Ilium, of a ſubſtance ſufficiently thick, ſpreds it ſelf upon the Colon like a twined worm, and is annexed to the Membrane of the Peritonaeum; but by its End, it is joyned to the right Kidneys, the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum coming between, and is quite free and looſe from the Meſenterie.</p>
               <p>It is four fingers <hi>long,</hi> and as broad as ones thumb, but the Cavity thereof is very ſtrait. <hi>Riolanus</hi> did find it exceeding wide, and equal to the Stoma it ſelf, as I alſo have ſeen it. <hi>Sylvius</hi> did in many find it ſolid, without any Followneſs, and in ſuch perſons, the Dung
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41352:17"/>
does go immediately from the Ileon into the Colon. And <hi>Maſſa</hi> ſuſpects that this Appendix is only bred when the Child being from its Birth troubled with a Looſneſs, the liquid Dung paſſing ſpeedily by the Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, and not abiding therein, being fruſtrated of its Office, it grows lean. Howbeit, I have ſeen it of the ſame thinneſs in a Child new born.</p>
               <p>The Ancients by the Caecum un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood<note place="margin">The Inteſtinum caecum, or blind Gut of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</note> that globous and capacious part, at the beginning of the Colon, which <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Rufus Epheſius</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. For that it was known to the Ancients, contrary to what <hi>Laurembergius</hi> imagins, I do hence prove, becauſe 1. They diſſected Beaſts. 2. <hi>Pollux</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> have ſet it down diſtinctly. 3. <hi>Galen</hi> hath diſtinguiſhed it from the Colon, both by Uſe and Situation, placing the Caecum on the right Hand, and the Colon on the left.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Caecum is, not to be only for a marke or ſign, as <hi>Hofman</hi> imagines, But firſt to receive Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, leaſt they ſlip down violently into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and breed pains, and force us to be contiually go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtool. And there ſome imagine the Dreggs or Excrements proceeding from cherries and cherry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, which have been voided ſorty daies after they were eaten, did lie lurking. The <hi>Conciliator</hi> contends, that the Dung is here ſeparated from all chylous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Helmont</hi> places the <hi>Fermentum ſtercoreum</hi> or turdie Leaven, which turns the Excrements of the Chyle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to plain Turds, in this place. 2. It may help ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what towards the Elaboration of the Chyle, either by ſucking out of the white Meſaraick Veins ſome negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted parcels of Chyle, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid, or by digeſting the inobedient Chylus, which could not be tamed, in the Stomach and ſmall Guts, by reaſon of the multitude of Food taken in, as <hi>Zerbus</hi> ſuppoſes. 3. It may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Ligament to ſuſtain the Peritonaeum, leaſt it fall down. But <hi>Riolanus</hi> obſerved this very Gut Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum in a certain Apothecary rouled to the Groin, and in little Boys into their Cod, in whom it reſted upon the <hi>Os ſacrum. Severinus</hi> ſuſpects that the Reaſon why Dogs void their Dung with more then ordinary ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is, becauſe the caecum is in Dogs very narrow at the beginning, and a little oblique.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond thick Gut</hi> is called <hi>Colon,</hi> from the torment which is ſomtimes<note place="margin">The Gut Colon.</note> therein cauſed, by colick pains. Some think tis ſo called from its Hollowneſs, and becauſe it ſhapes the Belly. Others derive it from a word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to delay, becauſe it gives a ſtop to the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are in paſſage. The Author of a Treatiſe falſly aſcribed to <hi>Galen,</hi> derives it <hi>a colando,</hi> from ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe it is narrow like a ſtrainner, and involved, that there may be a Gradation of the Excrement, and that it may not deſcend all at once.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Situation</hi> is various, for its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which is capacious and round, is in<note place="margin">Its Situation and Progreſs.</note> the right Flank, ariſing from the caecum at the right Kidney to which it ſticks; then it is turned back upwards under the Liver; where it is ſomtimes knit to the Gall-bladder, and is thereby dyed with a clay-color yellowiſhneſs: It paſſes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, athwart, under the bottom of the Stomach, and on the left hand is joyned to the Spleen, with thin Membranes, and then it is tyed to the left Kidney, where it hath very crooked Turnings, which are apt to detain both Dung and Wind; and from thence it ends ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ong, upon the Rectum. Wherefore it doth a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> compaſs the whole Belly, and ſomtimes aſcends, and otherwhile deſcends (hence ſuch as do their buſineſs, have commonly one Harveſt after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtinct) that the Excrements may be the longer detained, and not flow out all on a ſudden, and that we may not every foot be ſollicited to go to ſtool. To which intent alſo ſerve its Magnitude and Cells. For;</p>
               <p>It is commonly eight or nine hands-breath in <hi>length,</hi> and the thickeſt and wideſt of all the Guts.</p>
               <p>It hath received <hi>Cells,</hi> that any hard Matter, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſufficiently digeſted, might be perfectly concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and at laſt through the milkie Meſaraicks, which are carried to the Colon, that ſaid Matter being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, might be ſent unto the Liver. And that theſe Cells might not be diſſolved, and that being collected into themſelves, they might make the Cavities at times, ſomtimes greater, and ſomtimes leſs.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Ligament</hi> deſcribed by few, or a <hi>certain Band,</hi> as broad as an half finger, is implanted through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle thereof, on the upper part long-wiſe, and ariſing from the Caecum, is termined in the Rectum. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over by reaſon of its largeneſs; it hath two ſtrong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments, one upwards, another downwards, that it may be tyed to the upper and lower Parts. <hi>Riolanus</hi> nevertheleſs accounts theſe two Ligaments to be but one, oppoſite to the upper Ligament.</p>
               <p>According to the Longitude of the Colon, there are extrinſecally obſerved certain fat Appendices, from the Spleen to the beginning of the <hi>Rectum Inteſtinum,</hi> as <hi>Riolanus</hi> and <hi>Spigelius</hi> have obſerved. Whoſe uſe is to moiſten the Gut, that the Excrements may ſlide down the more eaſily.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of the Colon, a<note place="margin">A Valve in the Gut Colon.</note> Valve is placed ſufficiently thick and membranous, invented by <hi>Baubinus,</hi> looking upwards, not downwards, as <hi>Laurentius</hi> writes: for the Excrements do aſcend and not deſcend, when they paſs out of the Ileon into the Colon, by reaſon of upper Situation of the Guts. But if the Natural ſetling of the Excrements be conſidered, they deſcend making haſt out of the Body: And thus <hi>Bartholinus</hi> and <hi>Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingerus</hi> are reconciled. The firſt Invention of this Valve, ſeems to be long unto <hi>Salomon Alberts</hi> an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſt of <hi>Witteberg,</hi> as appears in an Appendix to three Orations ſet forth by him, about the End, and from the Obſervations of <hi>Schenkius, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Title de Ilio.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, beſides <hi>Bauhinus Varolus</hi> did alſo attribute the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention thereof unto himſelf, who was a well known Anatomiſt in the Univerſity of <hi>Padua,</hi> in the year 1572. And therefore <hi>Riolanus</hi> conceives the firſt Invention thereof, ought to be attributed rather to him then <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinus;</hi> But truly, it is in vain that he ſeeks to bereave him of this commendation, ſeeing divers Perſons may obſerve one and the ſame thing, at one or ſundry times, without ſtealing the Invention one from another. For Nature lies open to all diligent Enquires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is found</hi> after this manner: Water<note place="margin">How it is found out?</note> poured or wind blown into the Gut Ile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot paſs through unleſs violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But Water doth a little mar the Gut.</p>
               <p>Touching its <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Shape</hi> and <hi>Number,</hi> Authors do not conſent. For omitting ſuch as wholly deny the ſame; <hi>Bauhinus</hi> determines that it is only one, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the figure of a Nail. <hi>Archangelus</hi> ſaith, that there are three Valves at the Caecum, as in the Heart, looking downwards. I have ſought it at <hi>Padua</hi> in many Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and at other places, and alwaies found it, but never more then one, and that of an orbicular or circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Shape. <hi>Pavius</hi> to <hi>Hildanus</hi> and afterwards <hi>Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgius,</hi> did not find out a membranous Valve, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Ring or Circle with an hanging brim. But the ſaid Circle is nothing but a Valve, for ſome Valves are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41352:17"/>
found of a circular Figure, both in the Heart, and in other Veins. The whole conſtitution of this Valve is elegantly deſcribed by that great Practitioner <hi>Nicholas Tulpius,</hi> that it is a Circle on which hangs a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, two fingers broad, and ſo ſhaped that it is fit to ſhut the egreſs of Inteſtinum Ileum. Before which there hangs a Cortin or ſlack veile as it were; now the latitude of this Pendulous Membrane is very unequal; for where it looks towards the Ileum, it diffuſes it ſelf looſely, to the quantity of near two fingers breadth, but the farther from the place it is, the cloſelyer it is ſtrait'ned, ſo that about the middle of the Gut (for ſo far it runs) it is either quite obliterated, and ends in to that Membranous compaſs, which inwardly ſevers the Inteſtinum Colon a Caeco. From which unequal la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, there follows neceſſarily that ſame circular form, which the value expreſſes being artificially ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: as the ſmaller picture faithfully expreſſes. Now this Membrane is faſtned above to that ſame fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brous circle which ends the Colon, but it is faſtned below or rather ſtrongly held, by two very little Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, proceeding on both ſides from the ſide of that Orifice, through which the thinner Guts disburthen themſelves into the wider: the uſe of which bones, is to hinder that the value do not eaſily totter, for they bind it to the Ileum: But the lower part of the value doth wave up and down looſely.</p>
               <p>The <hi>uſe</hi> thereof is, that nothing may paſs back out of the thick Guts into the thin, be it Wind or Excrement, eſpecially in a ſtrong excretion or ſtraining at ſtool, or in coſtiveneſs of the Belly. Hence it is, that the matter of Clyſters cannot naturally reach unto the ſmal Guts.</p>
               <p>The Colon hath <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> under the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach from the Epiplois poſtica. But in the left ſide it hath the Haemorrhoidal Vein, and from the lower Meſenterick, the Haemorrhoidal Artery.</p>
               <p>The laſt thick Gut is termed REC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUM, becauſe it goes ſtraight out,<note place="margin">The Inteſtinum rectum, or the ſtraight Gut.</note> without any turning, and ends at the Fundament; for it goes ſtreight downwards, from the top of the Os Sacrum to the extremity of the Crupper-bone, to which it is <hi>Knit</hi> firmly, by the Peritonaeum, leaſt it fal of: alſo it <hi>grows</hi> in men to the Piſpipe in the Yard; to the Neck of the Womb in Women, by mediation of a Muſculous ſubſtance. Whence ſprings the conſent of theſe parts in Men and Women, eſpecially of the Womb and this Gut in Women, for the Gut being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerated, oft-times the Excrement is caſt out the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Privity.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>long,</hi> as it were an Hand-breath and an half, and three fingers broad; and Corpulent and <hi>thick,</hi> having Fat Appurtenances, growing thereto on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</p>
               <p>It hath <hi>Veins</hi> from the Hypogaſtrick branch of the Vena Cava, and Haemorrhoidal Veins.</p>
               <p>Four <hi>Nerves</hi> are inſerted into the end thereof, which make this Gut very ſenſible, as is apparent in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſmus.</p>
               <p>Its end is termed <hi>Podex</hi> or <hi>Anus,</hi> the <hi>Arſe</hi> or <hi>Fundament,</hi> having three Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,<note place="margin">Touching the Fundament.</note> of which peradventure five may be made. The,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Fallopius</hi> and others do make two of this Muſcle, becauſe its upper part is thicker; the inferior part is inſeparably annexed to the Skin, as is ſeen in the Fore-head and Eye-lids, and therefore <hi>Galen</hi> called this part the skinny Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or the fleſhy Skin.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Its <hi>uſe</hi> is, to purſe up the Fundament, that we may do our buſineſs when we pleaſe. And therefore being palſied or otherwiſe hurt, it makes the dung to come from a man whether he will or no: even as the Sphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the Bladder being hurt, the piſs flows out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily.</p>

They are called <hi>Ani Levatores</hi> Arſe-lifters. Becauſe,</p>
               <p>Their <hi>uſe</hi> is to draw the Fundament upwards into its own place again, after the Excrements are voided. eſpecially when we have been forced to ſtrain hard at ſtool. And therefore when they have been weakned or ſlacked, ſomtimes the Fundament is drawn up with difficulty, and ſomtimes it continues hanging forth.</p>
               <p>Theſe Muſcles are under the Bladder broad and thin, ariſing from the Ligaments of the Share, the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> and Hip: from whence they are carried downwards, to the right and left ſides of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they compaſs about. But they have a certain peculiar and diſtinct portion, growing to the Root and Neck of the Yard, which may be counted a third and diſtinct Muſcle. The uſe of theſe Muſcles ceaſes in thoſe who have their Fundament ſhut up.

Out of this he fetches the Original of the milky Veins, with probability enough, becauſe there they grow all into one, and from hence are carryed both downwards and upwards to the Liver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Add hereunto, that it is in color like thoſe Veins; and the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41352:19"/>
Veins themſelves have in this place ſomwhat proper, viz. that they are interwoven in the whole Body of this Pancreas, with wonderful turnings, twiſtings, and twinings.</p>
               <p>It is ſurrounded with <hi>Fat</hi> as in the Call, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from fat blood ſlipt out of the Veſſels, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the denſity of the Membranes, and ſo conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; that it may cheriſh the Heat of thoſe Parts, and further the preparation of Chyle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of theſe <hi>Kernels</hi> is, 1. To prop up and ſupport ſundry Diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note place="margin">The Uſe of the Kernels.</note> of the Branches of <hi>Vena porta</hi> and <hi>Arteria magna.</hi> Hence it is, that about the Centre of the Meſenterie are the greateſt Kernels, becauſe there is the Diſtribution of the greater and more collected Veſſels. Moreover, theſe Glandules or Kernels, when they are at any time troubled with a ſcirrhous hard Tumor; there follows a Leanneſs of the whol Body, becauſe they bear hard, and lie upon the branches of the <hi>Vena portae,</hi> and of the milkie Vein, ſo that the Nouriſhment cannot be freely carried through the ſaid Veins. 2. To moiſten the Guts, with the Humors which they ſuck out of the Parts, and promote Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by way of boyling as it were. Which Uſe <hi>Spigelius</hi> denies, becauſe there are Animals that have not theſe Glandules, and nevertheleſs are fat; and others though they have theſe, are lean. Which may happen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to my aſſertion, becauſe theſe former Animals have ſuch good Juyce, as needs no purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the latter have ſo little nutritive Juyce, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſufficiently be depurated by theſe Glandules. And therefore, 3. They ſerve to ſuck ſuperfluous Humors out of the Guts, which was <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Opinion. I add 4. A peculiar Uſe, viz. to receive that plenty of milkie Veins which paſſes that way, and to keep ſome portion of the Chyle, becauſe 1. It is of like uſe with that greater middle Kernel, and its ſubſtance is the ſame with that which exceeds this only in magnitude, becauſe greater milkie Veins paſs that way. 2. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that in Fiſhes, eſpecially in a Lump-fiſh male and female, beſides the great white one, the others did alſo ſend forth a white Juyce. 3. This being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, both Atrophia and other Diſeaſes are better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, to which Opinion alſo <hi>Aſellius</hi> ſeems to have encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And whereas <hi>Riolanus</hi> makes the Seat and Root of al Kings-evil ſwellings to be in theſe Kernels, and ſaith they never ſhew themſelves on the outſide of the Body, except the Meſenterie be firſt diſeaſed with the ſame kind of Swellings, is not likely, for 1. Though they may be remote and accidental cauſes. 2. There is no communion between theſe kind of Swellings in the Head, and the Kernels of the Meſenterie. 3. Many have the Kings-evil ſwellings, in whom theſe Kernels are perfectly ſound. 4. All would be ſubject to ſuch Swellings, becauſe all have theſe Kernels. 5. Thoſe people dwelling under the <hi>Alpes,</hi> that are ſo ſubject to theſe Swellings, ſhould have their Meſenterie differing from thoſe that are not ſo troubled. 6. The ſaid Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are filled by any kind of Humor proceeding from any Region of the Body.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of the <hi>Meſenterie</hi> is to be the common Band of the Guts, whereby<note place="margin">The Uſe of the Meſenterie.</note> they are knit to the Vertebra's of the Loins.</p>

               <p>Beſides all which, it hath alſo another <hi>Paſſage</hi> which is membranous, and of a peculiar Nature by it ſelf, ſpread out all along the Pancreas, ſomtimes in a ſtrait Line, ſomtimes in a crooked Line, which hath been as yet deſcribed by no Anatomiſt, being firſt diſcovered at <hi>Padua,</hi> when I was there, in the year 1642. by <hi>John George Verſungus,</hi> a very diligent Anatomiſt, but killed by cruel Fate; it is remarkeable for its Cavity, and the ſtrength of the Walls thereof. I beleive <hi>Fallopius</hi> did not know it. He mentions indeed ſmall Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ending into the Pancreas and Kernels next it; but becauſe this paſſage is only one, he rather ſaw through a miſt the milkie Veins, diſperſed into the Pancreas of the Meſenterie and other Kernels. It is for the moſt part ſingle, though the ſame Party had found it double running one by another in parallel Lines: A ſhort one in the ordinary place, and beneath it a larger. The Orifice whereof opens widely into the Gut Duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, near the Entrance of the Gal-paſſage, with which it is ſomtimes joyned by one and the ſame Mouth, but more frequently (as I found with the Author) by a different but neighboring Circle. The little Valve ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate before the egreſs thereof, looking outwards, keeps the Probe from entring this new paſſage, being thruſt in by the Duodenum. And therefore in a Living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being bound towards the Gut, it ſwells more and more, but beyond it is preſently emptyed, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive <hi>Jacobus Baccius,</hi> which is an Experiment hard to make for before that this paſſage which lies intangled and encombred can be freed, or bound, the Creature dies. From thence this paſſage creeps through the whole Body of the Pancreas, ſpreading out on both ſides infinite little Branches, until by narrower but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly diſpoſed twigs, it goes by little and little ſtraight forward, and is ſilently <hi>terminated</hi> towards the Spleen. But it goes not into the Spleen, although <hi>Folius</hi> hath aſſured me, that he hath obſerved it to go thereinto.

In which Cavity (truly) there is no conſpicuous Humor, ſave that a Probe being thruſt in, is for the moſt part died with a yellow cholerick colour, the Walls thereof being coloured with the like tincture, ſo that Choler ſeems to be therein contained, by the ordinary Law of Nature, which <hi>Johannes van Horn</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Friend of mine ſaw at <hi>Venice,</hi> in a cholerick looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the ſaid Veſſel being evidently full of Gall or Choler. And therefore this new found paſſages</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe,</hi> is not to carry Chylus ut of the Duodenum into the Spleen, bo uſe 1.<note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note> It doth not reach to the Spleen. 2. A Valve hinders the Ingreſs. Nor doth it ſerve to carry Melancholy out of the Spleen, to which uſe ſerve the <hi>Capſulae atrabilariae,</hi> the black Choler boxes. Nor to carry fermentative Juyce unto the Stomach, as <hi>Horſtius Junior</hi> ingeniouſly feignes, Becauſe 1. Such Juyce is not bred in the Pancreas, which is a glandulous Body. 2. The way is more ready to that purpoſe, from the Spleen; this being a more troubleſom and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred paſſage, for it would be troubled by meeting the Chylus in the Duodenum, and would be infected by the nearneſs of the Gall-paſſage. 3. Never any ſuch Juyce ſeen in this paſſage. 4. Who will be bound that it ſhall be able to paſs beyond the Pylorus? Nor is it to prepare Chylus, which <hi>Baccius</hi> affirmes to be found in living Creatures. Nor to nouriſh the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas, ſeeing that Humor is therefore unfit, and the coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liack Arteries do that work, but for the common good. But how, or which way ſhall it return to the Liver? For he rightly denies it to the Spleen. Shall it return to the Duodenum, and from thence to the Meſentery? There would be an infinite Circulation. He ſhall not eaſily find it in living Anatomies; alſo he confounds the Pancreas with the large Kernel of the Meſentery. Nor finally does it ſend the Excrements of the Chyle to the Duodenum, as <hi>Licetus, Riolanus,</hi> and <hi>Veſtingus</hi> conceive; for in this Paſſage no Chyle is ſeen, but yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Walls. Moreover the refuſe of the Chyle is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready voided by ſtool, nor does the Chyle part with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new Excrement, till it undergo a new change in the Veins of the Liver. Now ſure it is, that out of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41352:20"/>
Pancreas it ſelf, whoſe proper paſſage it is, and in which it begins, and is ended, ſomwhat is thereby voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the Guts, and it doth as I conjecture.</p>
               <p>1. Purge forth Choler, whether bred in the Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Pancreas, or in the Spleen, for each of theſe are taken to be Auxiliary-Livers. And it is as it were the Bladder-gall of the Spleen, which is conveniently joyned by its mouth, to the other paſſage of the Livers-Gall-bladder, by the Duodenum, ſo that look what uſe the one affords to the Liver, the ſame the other may be ſuppoſed to afford to the Spleen. And to prevent our doubting, the Humor of Choler daubs the inſide of this Paſſage. To which Opinion of mine, very many Learned men have aſſerted, though in ſome things they diſſent.</p>
               <p>2. To receive into it ſelf the Excrements of Arterial Blood from the Heart and Spleen, though the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Branches of <hi>Arteria Coeliaca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Riolanus</hi> counts it a profitable Uſe, that by this Paſſage, in vomiting, divers Humors are purged out, and the Redundancies of the firſt Region; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the fomenting Humors which maintain long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and malignant Feavers and chronical Diſeaſes, and which lurks in the Pancreas, is this way voided forth. And I may well ad ſomwhat to this moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Invention. That not only by Vomit, but alſo by ſtool, through the aſſiſtance of Choler-purgers, hot cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick Diſtempers may be by this Paſſage diſcharged, which burn the Meſentery, Spleen, Arteries, and Heart it ſelf. And hence proceed cholerick ſtools in burning Feavers, and blood in a Dyſentery or Bloody-flux, by reaſon of the large Inundation of Choler, continually flowing from hence into the Guts; which is ſo much the more hard to cure, by how much the Pancreas doth lie out of the reach of Medicaments, being deeply whelmed among the Bowels.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe of the Pancreas it ſelf</hi> is, 1. To prop and ſupport Veſſels paſſing<note place="margin">The Uſe of the Pancreas.</note> through the ſame, as the Branches of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na porta,</hi> of the Coeliack Artery, and of the Nerves: Eſpecially the <hi>Ramus Splenicus.</hi> 2. To aſſiſt the Concoction of the Stomach, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in Heat and Moiſture. 3. To ſerve as a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion under the Stomach. And therefore that old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Rome</hi> in whom it was become ſtoney, fell firſt into a continual Vomiting, afterwards into an Atrophy or conſuming of fleſh, and at laſt died thereof, as <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolus</hi> hath it in his Obſervations. 4. To ſuck out the wheyiſh Blood which ſlides along that way, and through help of the Kernels to purge it. 5. In ſickly and melancholick Bodies, to perform the Office of the Spleen, which <hi>Riolanus</hi> ſhews from the Example of the moſt renowned <hi>Thuanus:</hi> Whoſe Pancreas or Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, did equal the Liver in amplitude and weight, yet was it wholly ſcirrhous; but his Liver hard and round as a ball, and full of Flegm like Potters-clay, and his Spleen was found ſo ſmall, that it hardly wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghed an ounce.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Touching the Liver.</head>
               <p>ANd ſo much may ſuffice to have ſaid touching the Organs deſtined to primary Digeſtion or Chyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, we come now to thoſe which are any waies aſſiſting the ſecond Concoction or Sanguification. And the Principal of theſe is the Liver.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Liver</hi> is an Organick Part ſeated in the Lower Belly, juſt under the Diaphragma or Midriff, on the right ſide, being the Organ of Blood-making, and the beginning of the Veins.</p>
               <p>It hath its Name in Greek, from a Word that ſignifies want or Indigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,<note place="margin">Why the Liver is the Original of the Veins?</note> becauſe it ſupplies the want of the Parts of the Body, the Latins cal it <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,</hi> as if you would ſay <hi>juxta Cor,</hi> near the Heart. 'Tis called the Principle or Beginning of the Veins, becauſe therein the Roots of two of the greateſt Veins appear diſperſed, viz. of the <hi>Cava</hi> and <hi>Portae,</hi> as Roots implanted in the Earth. The milkie Veins are ſuppoſed to ariſe from the Pancreas: Yet Trunks and Branches of them are alſo to be ſeen in the Liver. Now the Roots of Trees diſperſed in the Earth, do grow together into a Trunk without the Earth. The <hi>Vena arterioſa</hi> of the Heart, is in truth an Artery: And the <hi>Arteria venoſa,</hi> is a Vein, and may owe its Original to the Liver, becauſe in a Child in the Womb, it is joyned with the <hi>cava,</hi> and opens it ſelf thereinto by an Anaſtomoſis: And beſides, it carries Blood to the Heart, but brings none from it, if there be any force in this Argument.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Liver</hi> is commonly but one in <hi>Number,</hi> ſeldom two: And more ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<note place="margin">Its Number.</note> is the Liver quite wanting, as in <hi>Matthias Ortelius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is <hi>ſituate</hi> in the loweſt Belly, under<note place="margin">Its Situation.</note> the <hi>Septum tranſverſum</hi> (which alſo <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotie</hi> acknowledged) by the Ribs, and for the greater part in the right Hypochondrium, a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers breadth diſtant there from, that the motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might not be hindered: Therefore a Swelling in the Liver cauſes ſhortneſs of breath. In Birds it lies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually on both ſides: As alſo for the moſt part in Dogs which have a thin and long Spleen. In Man it ſeldom changes its place, ſo as the Liver ſhould be in the left, the Spleen in the right ſide, which <hi>Gemma</hi> and <hi>Spererius</hi> have obſerved. It reſts lightly upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and upper part of the Stomach, eſpecially on the right ſide, for otherwiſe ſome part thereof reaches to the left ſide alſo, and ſomtimes the greateſt part, the Spleen being very ſmall. But ſome conceive that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> was ignorant of the Situation of the Liver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſaid <hi>Huper de to Diazoma,</hi> &amp;c. which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret, above the Septum is the Liver ſeated. But the Philoſoper is thus to be tranſlated: It is placed on the other ſide, or beyond the <hi>Septum tranſverſum;</hi> for <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> with an Accuſative ſignifies beyond, but with a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netive, it ſignifies above.</p>
               <p>And by reaſon of the Midriff, to which<note place="margin">Its Figure.</note> it was to give way, it hath its upper and outward <hi>Figure</hi> ſufficiently round, convex or gibbous, even and ſmooth, where alſo there is an oblong Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, behind at the Paſſage of <hi>Vena cava.</hi> And becauſe of the Stomach it hath received a Figure which is hollow on the inner and lower ſide, which is termed its ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous or ſaddle ſide, and it is more uneven then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having in it two hollowneſſes: One on the right hand for the Gall-bladder; another on the left, for the Stomach to paſs by. So that the Liver is on the right ſide of an ample roundneſs, but on the left it is narrow and ſharp.</p>
               <p>The Liver is <hi>divided</hi> by ſome, into the<note place="margin">Its Diviſion.</note> right and left part: between which there is a ſmal cleft or chink, where the Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical<note place="margin">A Mans Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Laps or Scol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops.</note> Vein enters.

I have more then once found intertwiſted ropes of Worms, in other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Liver.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>faſtned</hi> by three ſtrong Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 1. To the <hi>Belly,</hi> by the <hi>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belicalis</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Its Connexion.</note> 
                  <hi>Vena,</hi> or Navil-vein, which after the Birth, is in grown Perſons dried up, and turns to a Ligament, leaſt the Midriff ſhould dangle too much, and ſhould hang too low down. 2. <hi>Above</hi> to the Midriff, on the right ſide, by a broad membranous and thin Ligament, but yet a ſtrong one ariſing from the Peritonaeum, which the Midriff undercircles; and this is called the <hi>Ligamentum ſuſpenſorium</hi> or hanging Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 3. Alſo <hi>above</hi> to the Diaphragma, but on the left hand, by another Ligament ſprung from the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum, round, and exceeding ſtrong: Alſo in its <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-part</hi> where the <hi>Vena cava</hi> paſſes, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> cleavs by its bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy ſide to the Peritonaeum. <hi>Riolanus</hi> reckons theſe three Ligaments for one, becauſe he contends that the umbelical Vein is dried up, which being carried through a duplicature or folding of the Peritonaeum, hath for its Companion the Membrane it ſelf, which being rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led back over the Liver, runs out upwards &amp; downwards to the Diaphragma it ſelf, which it inveſts and faſtens. But it is al one caſe. For Ligaments are termed ſundry, becauſe they faſten and ſuſpend divers parts of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, although the two latter ariſe from the Peritonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. Now therefore according to his reckoning, there will be two Ligaments, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> one only; the former from the Umbelical, and the other from the Peritonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. The fourth Ligament annexed to the <hi>mucronata Cartilago,</hi> at the Cleft of the Liver, is no pecular one, but muſt be reckoned as part of our ſecond Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>It hath a <hi>Subſtance</hi> red and ſoft [ſo<note place="margin">Its Subſtance.</note> that with a little ſtick it may be beaten off, and ſeparated from the Veſſels interwoven, either when it is boyled or being raw] ſpred about the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, like congealed blood, for which cauſe it is termed <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> that is to ſay an Effuſion or ſhedding forth of blood, becauſe it is poured about the Veſſels, and fills the ſpaces between them [in ſome kind of fiſhes it ſeems to be a congealed Fat, out of which an Oyl is boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to burn in Lamps. Yet is it hardly corrupted; for <hi>Riolanus</hi> hath obſerved that a Liver having been acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally kept a year together, hath remained uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. In ſubſtance it is moſt like an Oxes Liver, and being boyled; differs not there-from, neither in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, color, nor taſt, and therefore our fleſh is more like that of Oxen then of Swine.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Color</hi> of a ſound Liver is ruddie [but<note place="margin">Its Color.</note> if it be quite void of blood, or boyled, we may rightly ſay with <hi>Gordonius,</hi> that it is whiteiſh, as in an Embryo, before affuſion of blood be made. But we ſhall find it very large and red, in Children new born, of a good Conſtitution. I have demonſtrated it to be yellow, in the fiſh called a Lump. In a Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prey it is green (which makes <hi>Bronzerus</hi> diſpute touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Principallity of the Liver) though the blood be red, whether it have contracted its color here, or in the Heart, or from it ſelf] In ſome ſick perſons, as thoſe which have the Dropſie, it is very pale, as alſo the Spleen and Kidneys.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe <hi>Veſſels</hi> in the Liver, are the<note place="margin">Its Veſſels.</note> 
                  <hi>Roots of Vena portae and cava,</hi> (with a few [to a mans firſt thinking, but upon ſerious Examination according to the Obſervation of <hi>Walaeus,</hi> an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company of] ſmall Arteries interpoſed, of a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter color, diſperſed from the Coeliaca, through the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle part thereof) [partly that they might nouriſh the Liver, and warm it throughly with the heat of the heart the branches of <hi>Vena portae</hi> aſſiſting likewiſe to the ſame intent; partly that by the motion of the Pulſe, and the neceſſity of running back, it may aſſiſt and provoke the paſſage of the blood out of the Liver according to the conjecture of <hi>Slegelius.</hi> For whereas <hi>Galen</hi> tells us that the Liver is cooled by the Arteries, that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to truth: For they are hot, and by their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on further the blood, and draw it to thoſe parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are implanted;] which appear diſtinct, the fleſh or Parenchyma of the Live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being taken away, how they are carried this way and that way, without order, among which alſo ſmall branches are diſſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which afterwards unite into one common Paſſage, and ſo carry Choler into the Gall-bladder. Now it is conjoyned with the Roots of <hi>Porta,</hi> that there the Blood may be ſeparated from the Choler. But more Roots of the <hi>Porta</hi> are ſpred up and down here and there through the lower part of the Liver, very few through the upper part: Contrariwiſe, more of the Roots of the <hi>Cava</hi> are carried through the upper and tuberous, or boſſie part thereof, and fewer through the hollow or ſaddle part. To theſe muſt be added the Roots of the Milkie Veins. <hi>Aſellius</hi> did ſomtimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their trunk to be in the Liver. But he did not preciſely add the place, which I have determined to be in the third Lobe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Anaſtomoſes</hi> or Conjunctions of<note place="margin">Their Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomoſes.</note> the Roots of <hi>Vena Porta</hi> and <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> are peculiarly to be obſerved. For reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting thoſe who altogether deny the Union of theſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41352:21"/>
Veins, or who conceive that they are obſcurely and hardly known: [among whom <hi>Harvey</hi> and <hi>Riolanus</hi> are lately come upon the ſtage, the former of whom could no where find any Anaſtomoſis, either in the Liver, Spleen, or any other Bowel, though they had been boyled, till the whole <hi>Parenchyma</hi> would crumble in peices, and was ſeparated like duſt from all the ſtrings of the Veſſels, with a needle. Only he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this one thing, in a freſh Liver, viz. that all the branches of Vena Cava creeping along the boſſie part of the Liver, have Coats like ſelves full of infinite lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle holes, as being made for the draught of the Body, to receive ſuch Blood as ſettles there: but that the branches of the Vena Portae are not ſo but are divided into boughes, and that every where the branches of both, do run out to the higheſt Eminency of the boſſie ſide of the Bowel, without Anaſtomoſes. But the Porta hath likewiſe very many holes great and little, as the Cava hath, ſome of which will admit the probe, others not, only they make certain Cavities covered with a thin Membrane. Whence it is apparent, that the blood is ſtaied by thoſe cloſed holes and not ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out, ſome of them being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> covered with a Coat, <hi>Riolanus</hi> inſpired by the ſame Spirit, doth ſtrongly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Anaſtomoſes of the Vena Cava and Portae leaſt he ſhould be forced to admit the Circulation of the Blood in that Place. He was afraid that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted liquor ſhould be confounded and mixt with the unconcocted. And what if they be confounded and jumbled together? The Chymus being changed into imperfect blood is confounded coming out of the milky Veins, with that which is contained in the Cava, for both of them are to be perfected in the Heart. And the other which flows out of Porta, prepares both with its acid juyce. But be it how it will be, the Authority of all Anatomiſts doth aſſert thoſe Anaſtomoſes from the times of <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> to our daies, becauſe it is manifeſt to ſuch as ſearch diligently, that theſe roots are joyned together, ſomtimes athwart, ſo that one lies over the middle of another as it were, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the extremities of one Vein touch the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or ends of another, otherwhiles the ends of one touch the middle of the other; and ſomtimes they touch not one another at all; peradventure where the Branches of the Liver ſerve only for Nutrition. <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinus</hi> wiſhes us chiefly to obſerve a remarkable Anaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſis, which reſembles a channel, and is as it were a common and continued paſſage, out of the Roots of Porta into the Roots of Cava, admitting a pretty big Probe. But becauſe we cannot rely upon naked Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, experience muſt be called by us to counſel, which doth neceſſarily perſwade us that there are ſuch Anaſtomoſes or Unions of the Mouths of the Veſſeis, by reaſon of the paſſage of the Blood out of the milky Veins and the Venae Porrae, unto the Cava, and out of the manifeſt Arteries, ſeeing the paſſage only through the fleſh cannot ſuffice, in a quick and plentiful Flux. I confeſs all the kinds of Anaſtomoſes are not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Eye as to be ſeen open, in dead bodies, though no man can therefore deny that there are ſuch things; but ſome of them are inſenſible, which admit neither Probe not Wind, and ſome admit Wind and nothing elſe. The Renowned <hi>Walaeus</hi> obſerved and found by experience, that the Veins of the Porta are in the Liver no where opened into the greater branch of Vena Cava, but that the very ſmalleſt branches of Vena Porta, do open into the ſmalleſt branches of the Vena Cava, as he obſerved in a Liver blown up with wind, after the fleſh was taken away, and floating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on water. I have in an Oxes Liver curiouſly ſought for apparent Anaſtomoſes, becauſe there they muſt needs be viſible becauſe of the greatneſs, following the example of the moſt learned <hi>Slegelius.</hi> But the very truth is they are not viſible to the Eye: the Veſſels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are divers waies interwoven and twiſted one among another; Trunk with Trunk, branches of the Trunkes, either with the Trunk of another Vein, or with little branches; and that either in the middle of thoſe little branches, or in the extremities, even as we ſee both the Veſſels cleave together in the Womb-cake: But a Probe finds no entrance, by any open hole of an Anaſtomoſis. Nevertheleſs, it is not to be denied, but that in living<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bodies there is a paſſage known to Nature though unknown to us by reaſon of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a through paſſage. Which I the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe that in the conjunction of the Veſſels, yea even of the greater, where the Anaſtomoſes ſeems ſhut, the Coat is extraordinary thin and for the moſt part ſingle, as appears by its tranſparency, which in Living Bodies being ratified by heat and motion, doth eaſily ſuffer the blood to paſs through.</p>
               <p>By theſe Unions therefore of the Roots of the Vena Cava and the Vena Portae, the Blood may paſs through: And by them likewiſe the peccant matter paſſes, when we Evacuate the habit of the Body by Purgations. Not that it ſhould be carried out of the Porta to the Meſentery, as hath been hitherto beleived, but ſo as thence to paſs through the Heart, and be emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied out through the Caeliacal Arteries, and thence through the ſtomach or the Gall-Conduits into the Guts, forced along by virtue of the purging Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Anaſtomoſes are likewiſe to be obſerved, by which the ſmal Veins of the Gall-bladder, are joyned to the Branches of Vena Portae and Vena Cava.</p>
               <p>The Roots of Vena Portae, do by little<note place="margin">The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Veins.</note> and little towards the lower part become ſmaller and greater, until they make one Trunk, which is called <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> the Gate-Vein: So alſo the Roots of the Cava, above and in the fore-part do altogether make up one <hi>Trunk;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the going out whereof, certain Circles are placed, here and there in the greater branches, being of a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous ſubſtance and very like to Valves, ſomtimes thicker, other whiles thinner and like Cobwebs, which were firſt diſcovered by <hi>Stephanus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and after by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringius</hi> in an Oxes Liver; and I likewiſe found them, looking towards the larger trunk, which hinder the return of blood, not ſo much of that which is impure and dreggy, as of the pair being once gone out to the Heart: afterwards, as ſoon as it comes to the Liver, it is divided into two great branches, the aſcendent and deſcendent; and hence it is that they ſay, the Cava ariſes from the upper or boſſie part of the Liver, and the Vena Portae from the lower and hollow part.</p>
               <p>The Liver hath two <hi>Nerves</hi> from the ſixt pair, one from the Stomach, another from the Coſtal, diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed only through its Coat, and not through its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (as <hi>Veſalius</hi> will have it) that in its inmoſt body, it may be void of ſenſe, in regard of ſo many motions of humors. And therefore the pains in this part are, dul and rather a kind of Heavyneſs then pain. Yet <hi>Riolanus</hi> hath obſerved, that two remarkable little Nerves do accompany the Vena Portae, and go into the very ſubſtance of the Liver.</p>

any thing without it. 1. Becauſe the Meſeraick Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have enough to do to drive out their own blood, and the Veins have work enough to receive it. 2. And the milky Veins are exceeding ſmall. 3. The proper Fibres of the Veins, do ſerve more for ſtrength, then for driving. 4. The Stomach indeed, and the Guts are contracted, but they are not able to expel the chyle; for their motion is obſcure, and though it were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yet it would not preſently follow, that it muſt drive into the Liver. 5. Thoſe Bowels being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted on all ſides, and ſhut up, as much Chyle is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as is expelled. 6. The Abdomen doth oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reſt, according to our deſire and pleaſure, being apt to be moved by the Muſcles; but the motion of the Chylus is performed continually and ſwiftly, viz. the due time of diſtribution being come. 7. The dreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Chyle ſhould be ſent unto the Liver, without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as well as the pure. It is therefore <hi>principally</hi> drawn by the Liver, howbeit ſome conſtruction of the Guts, is <hi>ſecondarily</hi> aſſiſtant thereunto. This Chymus being attracted in the Roots of the milky veins, as in the place where, is by the Parenchyma or Subſtance of the Liver, as the Efficient cauſe, with the aſſiſtance of the internal heat of the Chyle, changed into a new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of blood. Now it gains a <hi>Redneſs</hi> like the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Liver, not ſo much from the fleſh of the Liver alone, which it ſelf ows its color to blood ſhed about it, which it layes away when it is waſhed or boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and in ſome other Creatures we find it of a green color, as from its own proper and adventitious Heat (as Grapes are red) which vaniſhing away, the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ceaſes, as it happens in blood-letting. Nor is that a ſufficient cauſe, ſeeing in healthy bodies it continues afterwards red, and therefore we muſt take in light as another Cauſe, of which there is a great quantity in red colors, ſubſiſting even without Heat, unleſs the ſubject happening to be diſſolved, it come to be extinguiſhed and exhale. Hence it is, that boyled blood becomes black, and putrid blood is duskie. Hence alſo, by how much the more Natural inbred light any man hath, the more he ſhines with bright blood; contrariwiſe, in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick perſons, the ſame being darkned, the blood grows black and dark. That light and fire are the cauſe hereof appears in Oyl of Sulphur, by the mixture whereof Liquors become red.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> is partly planted in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the Chyle it ſelf, ſpringing thereout, by reaſon of its previous preparation, and partly kindled therein, either by reaſon of the nearneſs of the Heart, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering parts, or by reaſon of the Arterial blood, derived from the Heart and Spleen.</p>
               <p>The more crude Blood being thus made, is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to nouriſh the Liver or the Body, which Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is performed by the Hepatick Arteries, but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Anaſtomoſes of the fleſh and Veſſels, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled into the Roots of <hi>Vena cava,</hi> where by longer tarriance, it is more elaborated, and ſoon after with the returning blood of the <hi>Vena porta</hi> and the Arteries, it is poured out into the Trunk of <hi>cava,</hi> going all ſtraight along, through the upper part of the Trunk to the heart, that it may there attain its laſt accompliſhment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it becomes fit to nouriſh all the Parts. Not any thing returns this way to the Liver, the Valves hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, which in the Liver look outwards, in the Heart inwards, as the whole Fabrick and Ligatures do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. By theſe it is, that the <hi>Cava</hi> alwayes ſwells towards the Liver, and is empty towards the Heart.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the Nouriſhment of all the Parts of the Body being accompliſhed by the Capillary Arteries, becauſe all the blood is not conſumed, which by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Pulſations is ſent forth, nor can that which is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous return the ſame way, by reaſon of the Valves of the Heart ſeated by the Aorta, which lets any thing paſs from the Heart, but admits nothing back again; and becauſe any Artery being tied, is full, and ſwels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Heart, but is empty, and lank towards the Veins: Therefore it muſt needs return as it were by a circular motion, out of the ſmalleſt Veſſels back again into the greateſt Veins, and the Trunk it ſelf of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> and thence into the Heart. As it paſſes through the Liver, other blood there newly bred, is joyned with that of the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> and that which is redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant from the Arteries, for the reſtoring of that which is ſpent, and ſo the <hi>Circulation</hi> is again repeated. Mean while, as hath been ſaid, Choler is drawn out of the blood, by branches of veſſels, terminating into the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bladder and Choler-paſſage. But the wheyiſh part, is becauſe of its thinneſs retained a while, that the blood may more eaſily paſs every where, and afterwards it is ſent away, partly to the Kidneys (with the wheyiſh blood, which according to <hi>Galen</hi> is not concocted in the Kidneys, but becauſe the Serum is an Excrement of the Liver, the Kidneys do only ſeparate the blood from the whey) and from thence by the Ureters into the Bladder; whence the Urin does afterward partly go into the Skin, and paſſes out by ſweat and inſenſible Tranſpiration.</p>

And if the force of the Spirits were ſo great, they might as eaſily open and ſhut the valves of the Heart, when they are in the Arteries more plentiful then ordinary. They pierce indeed by their fineneſs the valves, when they are ſhut, but they carry not the blood with them. Choler, truly, may by ſome other means be inflamed, which is every where among hot blood. Finally, the valve would be broken by the violence of Spirits, and greater danger might follow thereby, then if the Gall-bladder were broken, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample whereof <hi>Salmuth</hi> relates.</p>
               <p>The Gall-bladder hath received very many ſmall <hi>Paſſages,</hi> furniſhed with ſundry little twigs, ſowed up and down in the Liver, between the Roots of <hi>Cava</hi> and <hi>Porta;</hi> which afterwards being joyned into one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, do carry pure Choler into the Gall-bladder: and the Gall-bladder having diſgorged it ſelf into the Gut, is daily filled again, and ſo it continues that courſe. Contrary to the Opinion of <hi>Arniſoeus;</hi> that the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is filled with Choler, which being hindred by the Chylus, from deſcending by the <hi>Porus biliarius,</hi> into the Guts, does drive back again into the Bladder, For I have often ſeen <hi>Waloeus</hi> demonſtrate, how that the Bladder being never ſo little ſqueezed with a mans hand, even when the Guts are full of Chyle, Choler is eaſily ſquirted into the Guts.</p>
               <p>It hath two very ſmall <hi>Veins</hi> to nouriſh it. Alſo it hath very ſmall Arteries from<note place="margin">Its Veins and Arteries.</note> the Coeliaca, to nouriſh and preſerve Heat. It is not therefote nouriſhed with Choler, as <hi>Joubertus</hi> conceives. It hath a little dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive Nerve, ſcarce viſible, from a little Branch of the ſixt pare, which crawls up and down the Coat of the Liver.</p>
               <p>Its uſe is to receive yellow excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Choler, pure and thin (not the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement<note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note> mingled with the Blood, as the Kidneys do) and to retain it ſome while, and then to expel it.</p>
               <p>Now touching the <hi>uſe</hi> of this Choler, Learned men are of ſundry minds. Some with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> will allow it no uſe, only it was a thing could not be avoided, and is drawn away, that the Blood may not be defiled; which Opinion <hi>Conringius</hi> maintains. Others attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more to Choler, and make it uſeful to the whole Body. 1. In that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

If that be true, we muſt underſtand it of a moderate quantity thereof; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe an over great Heat of Choler would burn the Stomach.</p>
               <p>2. Ofkin to theſe, is the Opinion of <hi>Helmont;</hi> that it is the balſom of the Liver, and the whole Blood, brought from the Liver to the Meſentery, and that therefore the Gall precedes in the work of Sanguifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Liver follows; alſo he ſayes it hath the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a neceſſary Bowel. But how ſhould it come into the Liver, ſince Anatomy doth teach, that this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is brought out of the Liver, but not carried back thither. For, the way is too long, through the Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, where by reaſon of its acrimony, it makes haſt out, or the edge thereof is blunted. And of what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hall it be bred, if it go before the Concoction of Blood? There are few Veins and Arteries diſperſed there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, but ſtore of Choler is collected. That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Liver goes before that of the Gall, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the Womb do ſhew, in whom the Liver is full of blood, before the Bladder ſwell with Gall, or be ſo much as lightly colored therewith.</p>
               <p>3. Their Opinion is not much unlike, who conceive that Choler preſerves the neighbouring Parts, and the Liver it ſelf from corruption, which <hi>Zerbus</hi> would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prove, becauſe when the Gall-bladder is removed from the Liver, the ſubſtance thereof where the Gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bladder lay, does preſently diſſolve and melt.</p>
               <p>4. A greater number of Authors will have it to ſerve to expel the Excrements of the Belly, by ſtrengthening the Guts with its Heat, or provoking them to Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by its Acrimony. For although the Choler-paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, be implanted into the beginning of the Gut Jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, or into the Duodenum; yet it hath an eaſie paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Colon and Ileum. That it paſſes through the Jejunum, is manifeſt from its yellow color, and the quick paſſage of the Chyle there through. Howbeit, it ought to be moderate in quantity, otherwiſe the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is dried and made coſtive, or too much looſned.</p>
               <p>5. I add that it makes the Dung liquid, and apt to paſs, to which intent Painters uſe it to temper their colors.</p>
               <p>The other Receptacle of Choler, is<note place="margin">Porus biliarius.</note> the <hi>Canalis</hi> or <hi>Porus biliarius,</hi> the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-paſſage, which is found even in thoſe Animals which have no Gall-bladder, as the Hart, the Deer, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, the Roe, the Dolphin, the Sea-calf, &amp;c. It is a veſſel round and long, and the paſſage thereof is twice as large as the Neck of the Gall-bladder, and it goes right out from the Liver [being ſometimes forked, yet ſo that its two branches do ſoon become one, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Obſervation of <hi>Riolanus</hi>] through the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon paſſage into the Gut (not into the Gall-bladder, as <hi>Fallopius</hi> conceived) receiving a thick cholerick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement, which may plainly be perceived, if the ſaid paſſage be opened and blown up, for then the Gut ſwells, and not the Gall-bladder. And <hi>Riolanus</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that ſome have died of a Dyſentery proceeding from Choler, in whom the Neck of the Gall-bladder was obſtructed, but the <hi>Porus biliarius</hi> or Choler-paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, very much enlarged.

The moſt renowned <hi>Conringius</hi> allows the Premiſes for true in a praeterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural greatneſs of the Spleen, otherwiſe, if it be Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and legitimate, the Body flouriſhes when the ſpleen does flouriſh.</p>
               <p>Be the ſtate of the Spleen what it will, I conceive the Body is diminiſhed, when the Spleen is augmented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it bereaves the reſt of the Body of the fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive acid Juyce, and either conſumes it to nouriſh it ſelf, if it be naturally great; or is unable to prepare and expel it, when its greatneſs is praeternatural and ſickly.</p>
               <p>Its Shape is for the moſt part like on Oxes tongue, whence ſome have called it<note place="margin">Its Shape.</note>

On the outſide towards the Ribs and the Midriff, it is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bunching and boſſie; ſomtimes it hath marks made in it by the Ribs, being hollow on that ſide, which is towards the right hand, by reaſon of the ſtomach which lies cloſe by it: Where all along the middle part, there is a certain white Line, with prominencies in it, which admits Veins and Arteries with the Caul. Howbeit, praeternaturally it receives ſundry Figures, viz. exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly round, triangular, ſharp-pointed, <hi>made rough</hi> with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minencies, divided into two parts; as <hi>Archangelus</hi> hath rightly obſerved.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Color</hi> in a Child in the Womb is red,<note place="margin">Its Color.</note> like that of the Liver, becauſe it is nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pure Mothers Blood: But in perſons come to age, it is blackiſh, becauſe of the thick blood where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is nouriſhed, and in ſuch as are yet older, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes black and blew. I have obſerved it red in grown perſons, and <hi>Veſalius</hi> before me, as alſo <hi>Spigelius</hi> who therefore beleives, that ſuch as have it blackiſh are unhealthy. <hi>Conringius</hi> thinks that black color is cauſed by Intemperance in eating, and in drinking eſpecially. I do attribute much to the temper of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this caſe, and to the variety of Heat. Now the Spleen does praeternaturally put on many colors, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

But in its hollow part, it is knit to the upper Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the Caul, from which alſo (according to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the Peritonaeum, or as ſome will have it, proper to it ſelf) it receives,</p>

The numerous branches of this bough, being for the moſt part ſmall as Fibres, are ſpent in the Spleen, ſaving two which ſometimes paſs out of the Spleen: The one is called <hi>Vas breve</hi> entring into the ſtomach, ſometimes by one, otherwhiles by more branches [which more frequently, as <hi>Walaeus</hi> informs us, is a little branch of <hi>Vena ſplenica,</hi> which when it is come to the middle ſpace betwixt the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and the Spleen, it is divided forkwiſe into two twigs, one of which goes to the Spleen, the other to the ſtomach] which veſſel ſome will have to belch out acid blood to provoke appetite, or to ſtrengthen the ſtomach, which is afterwards voided by the Guts. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother branch goes unto the Fundament, and makes the internal Haemorrhoid Veins.</p>
               <p>It hath many and great <hi>Arteries</hi> from a<note place="margin">Its Arteries.</note> branch of the Coeliaca, which the Liver hath not. 1. To cheriſh life and inbred heat. 2.

               <p>Now we are to take ſpecial notice of the frequent <hi>Anaſtomoſes</hi> of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries<note place="margin">Its Anaſtomoſes.</note> of the Spleen, with the Veins thereof, eſpecially one remarkable one, before the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Veſſels into the Spleen: the reſt are in the Spleen.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Action</hi> of the Spleen is by ſuch Doctors as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the old Opinion ſaid to be chieſly threefold. 1. To draw melancholick, excrementitious, and ſlimy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors out of the Liver. 2. To ſeparate the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Excrement there from, that it may be nouriſhed by the good blood. 3. To void it being ſeparated, into the Stomach and Guts. Alſo they ſay that the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Spleen is elaborated and broken by the Arteries, becauſe ſpongy and looſe fleſh ought to be nouriſhed with vaporous and ſubtile blood. The Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages by which the melancholy Juyce is ſaid to be bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth, are firſt the <hi>Vas breve,</hi> and then the Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoidal Vein. They will have the Spleen therefore to be the Receptacle of the melancholick Excrement, or of thick dreggie Blood ſeparated in the Liver (even as the Gall-bladder receives the yellow Choler) and that therefore the Spleen is ſet juſt over againſt the Liver.</p>

               <p>Later Anatomiſts have conceived, that the Spleen doth elaborate Blood, as the<note place="margin">Whether the Spleen make Blood?</note> Liver doth, but they are not agreed, touching the way, nor the Nature of the Chyle. <hi>Caſparus Bartholinus</hi> my Father was of Opinion, that the Spleen did <hi>make a thick,</hi> but good ſort of Blood, of the thicker part of the Chymus, which by an inbred Faculty it hath, it draws to it ſelf, through the <hi>Ramus ſplenicus.</hi> This he proved,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By the likeneſs of the ſtructure of the Spleen, with that of the Liver. For as the Liver is a fleſhy Bowel, covered with a Coat, furniſhed with very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Veſſels, the fleſh whereof reſembles blood, ſhed round about: Even ſo, the Spleen is a Bowel, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Coat, and with very many Veſſels variouſly interwoven, whoſe proper fleſh is as it were congealed blood, ſhed round about the Veſſels.</item>
                  <item>2. In the Spleen, there are very many textures of the Veſſels and infinite Anaſtomoſes. Now there are no where ſuch textures, and plications, or foldings of the Veſſels, ſave for a new elaboration, as may be ſeen in the Brain, Liver, Stones, Duggs, &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>3. It appears from the Scituation of the <hi>Ramus ſpleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> which is far beneath the Liver, out of the Trunk of <hi>Vena porta,</hi> where part of the Chymus is attracted, or of the Chyle, which hath ſome diſpoſition towards blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If therefore it receives matter there, of which blood is made, why therefore ſhall not the Spleen make blood?</item>

                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41352:24"/>4. Nature is wont either to double the Parts of the Body, and ſet one on each ſide, as appears in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, Stones, Lungs, Duggs, Organs of the Senſes, &amp;c. or if ſhe makes only one, ſhe is wont to place it in the middle. as the Heart, Stomach, Womb, Bladder, Noſe, Tongue, Mouth, &amp;c. Therefore the Spleen muſt needs be another Liver.</item>
                  <item>5. Diſeaſes of the Spleen, as well as of the Liver, do hurt Blood-making or Sanguification.</item>
                  <item>6. Somtimes the Situation of the Liver is changed, ſo that it is in the left ſide, and the Spleen on the right.</item>
                  <item>7. The Liver failing and growing leſs, the Spleen is augmented, and aſſiſts the Liver, as is known by many Examples, whence the Spleen hath been often ſeen in Diſſections, to be greater and redder then the liver.</item>
                  <item>8. Tis unlikely that ſo many Arteries enter into the Spleen, for the ſake of Excrements, but rather to digeſt &amp; concoct thick Blood, that ſo by contrary thinneſs, the ſtubborn thinneſs of the ſaid Blood may be overcome.</item>
                  <item>9. In a Child in the Womb, the Spleen is red as is the Liver, by reaſon of the cauſe aforeſaid.</item>

                  <item>3. And therefore the liver is greater, becauſe it makes blood for the whole body beſides: The Spleen leſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes blood only for the lower Belly, ſave when in caſes of neceſſity it is forced to help the Liver.</item>
                  <item>4. In Dogs the Spleen is long and thin, becauſe the Parts or Bowels of the lower Belly are ſmaller in a Dog, and leſs wreathed and folded, then in a Man.</item>
                  <item>5. There is an evident difference between the Fat bred in the muſculous Parts, or thoſe which are nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> and that dirty, and ſoon pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And by how much an Humor is thicker (as is the muddie Fat we ſpeak of) ſo much the ſooner it putrifies: As the dreggie fat doth ſooner, then the Fat in muſculous parts. So the Blood of the Spleen is more diſpoſed to Putrefaction, then that of the liver, and this then the blood of the right Ventricle of the Heart. Moreover, the blood of the Arteries is leſs ſubject to Putrefaction, then any of the former; and the Spirit leaſt of all.</item>

But that Age de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves excuſe, as being ignorant of what Poſterity hath ſince found out. For the milkie veins diſcovered by <hi>Aſellius,</hi> do ſhew, that no Chyle thick or thin, is drawn by the Meſaraick Veins, or carried any whether, but by the milkie Veins only to the Liver, and not to the Spleen. Moreover, a Ligature in live Diſſections de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that nothing is carried through the Meſaraicks to the Spleen, but contrariwiſe from the Spleen to the Meſaraicks. Yet I allow thus much to the foreſaid reaſons, that there is a certain Generation of Blood made in the Spleen, by the manner hereafter to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, not of Chyle, which hath here no Paſſages, but of Arterial Blood, ſent from the Heart.</p>

For the Arteries are ordained to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blood to the Meſentery, which is very manifeſt by Ligatures, and it is contrary to the courſe of Nature, for the blood to be carried, and the Chyle brought back the ſame way, leaſt they ſhould be mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Moreover, in live Anatomiſts, there was never any Chyle obſerved there. And the dreggie Portion of the Chyle, which no part ſtands in need of to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it ſelf, is more fitly purged out by the Guts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sperlingerus</hi> a learned Man, conceives that this work is performed by the milkie Veins, as to the Liver.

The ſplenick Vein receives all its blood from the Spleen and its Arteries, and returns nothing, and therefore being bound in living Anatomies, it is filled, and ſwells towards the Spleen, according to the Obſervation of <hi>Walaeus,</hi> but towards the Liver it is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied. Howbeit <hi>Regius</hi> appeals to the Ligature, that the <hi>Vas breve</hi> ſwells betwixt the Ligature and the Stomach, and that it is lank between the Ligature and the Spleen. <hi>Bachius</hi> is nothing moved herewith, though he cannot untie the knot, and <hi>Hogeland</hi> is various in this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that I much doubt, whether the <hi>Vas breve</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſo filled, before I ſhall ſee it atteſted by the Eyes of ſome others.</p>

But all would be well, if thoſe men that have eyes in their heads, would ſhew us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Paſſages, or that peculiar Veſſel. The Pores are too narrow for the dreggie parts of the Chyle to paſs through, and who can hinder them ſweating out ſome other way, rather then into the Spleen? Many times when the Spleen ſtuck not ſo cloſe to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, I could ſee no veſſel, nor could I ſee any ſuch thing in a Youth, who having largely drunk, was here lately choaked with a bit of a Neates-tongue.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, <hi>Reuſner, Piſo,</hi> and <hi>Conringius</hi> lately praiſed, do ſuppoſe, that only potulent matter, is by the Spleen preſently ſuckt out, and that therefore it makes only watry Blood ordinarily. But there is no ſtrong and ſufficient reaſon for this Opinion, ſeeing there are no manifeſt Paſſages. Nor muſt it only draw that which is thin, which both the Blood and Chylus ſtand in need of, as a vehicle or carrier, though it flow not alone, but is variouſly mixed with groſſer matter, according to the Conſtitution of the blood; till having plaid its part, it is either ſeparated by the Kidneys, or ſweats through the whole Habit of the Body. If the whey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh moiſture be praeternaturally ſeparated in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, from the thicker Chyle, either it is voided by Vomit, and the groſſer Chyle wanting the help there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to carry it, will make the Colick in the Guts, as I ſaw in our famous <hi>Wormius;</hi> or it is voided through the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> which is alwaies open for liquid meats, and ſuch as are eaſily digeſted, according to the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our moſt deſired <hi>Walaeus;</hi> much more after much drinking, which is ſomtimes in great Drinkers, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voided by urin, not paſſing through the Spleen, but through the Guts, if there be a conveniency of quality, thinneſs of Humors, looſneſs of the Veſſels, and ſtrength of the attractive Faculty. All which conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <hi>Aſellius</hi> rightly avouches there is no way ſo long, which is not ſoon paſſed over. In ſuch as are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conſtituted, Drink does not ſo ſoon ſlip away by Urin. For ſome will drink all day, and never uſe a Chamber-pot. In ſome alſo their Belly becomes looſe, and the Drink goes away, queſtionleſs, by the Guts. The blood, indeed, of Splenetick perſons, is thin and warry, not that it comes ſuch immediately from the ſtomach, but the fault is in the whole blood, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by the Arteries to the Spleen. I paſs over, how that theſe are the ſigns of a diſordered Spleen, from the praeternatural ſtate whereof, no good Argument can be drawn to prove any thing, touching its Natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by which Anſwer, all other Arguments brought by moſt learned men, for this potulent Chylus are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               <p>It is a doubtful queſtion, why only<note place="margin">What Creatures have no Spleen</note> ſuch Creatures have Spleens, which have Kidneys and Bladders, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which <hi>Panarolus</hi> found true in a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeleon. Is it becauſe of the Attraction of wheyiſh Humors? I cannot beleive it. But they have no Spleen, becauſe they make little blood, and therefore the wheyiſh Humor did not want peculiar Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but the Superfluities of the blood is ſpent upon Feathers, Skin, Scales, &amp;c. They are therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Spleen, becauſe Fermentation was not neceſſary, in the imperfect Concoction of thoſe kind of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who have a perpetual and Natural Lientery.</p>

                  <hi>Riolanus</hi> hath lately in his Enchiridion out of all theſe Opinions, hammer'd a mixt action of the Spleen, to attract ſlimy Blood for its own Nouriſhment, and after that to pour out a certain particular fermentative Whey, through the ſplenetick Arteries into the ſtomach, and becauſe its fleſh is of a drinking Nature, to draw and ſuck ſuperfluous Liquor through the Veins out of the ſtomach. To which I have already anſwered, part by part. The Action verily of the Spleen is more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then to receive ſuperfluous Humors out of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. And through what Paſſages ſhould it do that? For the Office of the Veins is, to carry back the blood in the parts, out of the Arteries to the Trunk, according to the Doctrine of the Circulation, which <hi>Riolanus</hi> does here vainly oppoſe. And Ligatures in living A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomies do ſhew the ſame.</p>

For the contrary is ſeen in ſuch as have one Kidney only ſtopped with a great ſtone, or conſumed by an Ulcer; and the contrary to what he imagines, is ſeen in other parts, for one Eye being hurt, the other ſees; and all the ſcollups of the Lungs being conſumed on one ſide, that on the other ſide does further Reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs haply both parts be affected by ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe, for otherwiſe they muſt be forced to ſay, that that happens only ſomtimes. There is ſeldom found only one, and then it is a great one placed in the middle, for otherwiſe the body ſhould not be well bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced, nor could the Veſſels be conveniently carried. Tis monſtruous, when both the Kidneys are joyned into one beneath, and cleave together, as I have ſeen at <hi>Padua.</hi> Tis more rare to find three or four placed one upon another, or one beneath another.</p>
               <p>They are <hi>ſituate</hi> under the Liver and Spleen, where they reſt upon the<note place="margin">Their Situation.</note> Muſcles of the Loins, between the two Coats of the Peritonaeum, at the ſides of the <hi>Vena cava</hi> and <hi>Arteria magna,</hi> under which very great Nerves lie hid, both of the Muſcle <hi>Pſoas,</hi> and others, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently paſs this way unto the Thighs. Whence it is that a ſtone being in the Kidney, a numneſs is felt in the Thigh of the ſame ſide. It is a rare caſe which <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brolius</hi> hath obſerved, for the Kidneys to reſt upon the Back-bone of the Loins. Nor are the Kidneys ſeated juſt one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Which Kidney is the higheſt?</note> leaſt there ſhould be ſome impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to attraction, and leaſt ſome part of the wheyiſh humor ſhould ſlip aſide. But the <hi>right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide</hi> Kidney is <hi>loweſt in Men,</hi> to give way to the Liver, under which it reſts immediately, reaching by its end, the third Vertebra of the Loins. It is ſeldom higher then the left, and ſeldom are the two Kidneys ſeated one juſt againſt another. The left Kidney for the moſt part, lies partly under the ſpleen, but is ſeldom higher then the ſpleen. Contrariwiſe in Brutes, the ſpleen goes more downwards, and the right Kidney lies higher, and therefore there is a Cavity in the Liver by means of the Kidney, which does not Naturally happen in men. Here ſome obſerve that the right Kidney is nearer to the <hi>Cava,</hi> and the left more remote, by reaſon of the left Emulgent Vein, which is much longer then the right.</p>
               <p>They are not alwaies both juſt of one bigneſs, but for the moſt part they are.<note place="margin">Their Bigneſs.</note> They are commonly of the length of four Vertebra's; their latitude for the moſt part, three fingers, their thickneſs that of a thumb, yet the right Kidney is very many times larger then the left, becauſe by reaſon of the heat of the right part, it draws the wheyiſh blood more vehemently, unleſs it be fretted by ſome Diſeaſe, for then it grows lean and thin. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſuch as are given to fleſhy deſires, have larger Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys then ordinary. But their Proportion is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies alike convenient for the body.</p>
               <p>The Surface of the Kidneys, as in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is ſlippery and ſmooth: It is ſeldom<note place="margin">Surface.</note> in Mankind uneven, as if it were compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of many Kidneys or kernels, which any man may frequently find in a Child yet in the Womb. But the Kidney is alwaies ſo made, in an Ox and Bear, in a Calf, and moſt curiouſly of all in a Sturgeon, in which the Kidneys are made up like bunches of Grapes, of triangular and quadrangular dies or tiles as it were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Artificial manner, as I have demonſtrated in the Anatomy of that Creature.</p>
               <p>The Colour of the Kidneys is a dark<note place="margin">Their Colour.</note> red, but ſeldom intenſely red. In diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed perſons the Kidneys are variouſly coloured, even as the Liver and Spleen are.</p>
               <p>The Kidney is ſhaped like a kidney-bean ſo<note place="margin">Shape.</note> called, alſo like an Aſarum leaf, if you reſpect the plane ſurface.

And the right kidney, to the blind Gut, ſomtimes alſo to the Liver, the left to the Spleen and Colon. Hence pains of the kidneys are exaſperated by plenty of Winds and Excrements.</p>
               <p>They have a double <hi>Membrane:</hi> The<note place="margin">Membranes.</note> firſt internal one near and proper, being very thin without Fat and Veins, from the external and common Coat of the ingredient Veſſels dilated (for a Vein only goes in with but one Coat) which growing very cloſe, makes the fleſh more compact, and being turned back inwards, it accompanies the Veſſels, enters into, and inveſts their Bellies. <hi>Another</hi> external from the Peritonaeum, which adhaeres but looſely, whence they term it the <hi>Swath-band</hi> of the kidneys.

                  </figure> Heart, but not ſo fibrous, becauſe the Fibres of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are there. But on both ſides of the internal Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Fat being removed, there appears a looſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, uneven and hollow. This fleſh ſomtimes is conſumed and putrefies, whence comes worms in the kidneys. In a Dog I have ſeen a worm ſo great in the right kidney which lay hid like a ſnail, that beſide the external Coat of the kidney, there was none of the fleſh left.</p>
               <p>The kidneys have two <hi>Bellies</hi> as it were,<note place="margin">Their Bellies.</note> the outermoſt in the hollow part which <hi>Fallopius</hi> calls <hi>Porta;</hi> through which the emulgent veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are carried, and firſt they enter bipartite or divided into two, and ſoon after they are commonly divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four, and ſo ſpread abroad into the whole ſubſtance of the kidneys, till at laſt they are conſumed and ſpent into very ſmall and fine threads. The inner Belly is nothing but the large Cavity of the Ureter, that is to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41352:27"/>
ſay a membranous Cavity, made of the Ureters, ſpred out and widened in the Cavity of the kidneys. But the Ureters in their progreſs are not attenuated within, as other Veſſels are, but they have the ends of their branches (eight or ten for the moſt part) broad and open like Pipes, embracing certain Caruncles, or little fleſhy Eminences.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Caruncles</hi> are like kernels, leſs coloured and harder then the reſt of<note place="margin">The Caruncles.</note> the fleſh. <hi>Carpus</hi> was the Finder out of them, though <hi>Rondeletius</hi> ſaies that he did firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, and calls them Mammilary productions. Others call them Papillary Caruncles, becauſe they are very like the Nipples upon Womens Duggs: They are as big as Peaſe, ſomwhat broad above, convex be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and they have very little holes bored through them, ſo that they will hardly permit an hair to enter, which furrows and little channels may be obſerved, if the kidneys be cut long-wiſe. I have inſtead of theſe found ſtones in an Ox. The holes were to be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſmall, leaſt the blood which is requiſite to nouriſh the kidneys, ſhould with the Serum and Choler flow into the Ureters, which indeed happens when the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys are diſeaſed or the Paſſages too open.</p>
               <p>They have <hi>Veſſels</hi> of all kinds. <hi>Veins</hi> from the <hi>Cava.</hi> 1. The <hi>emulgent</hi> or <hi>milking</hi> Veins ſo called from their Office, which are great<note place="margin">The emulgent Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</note> and remarkeable by reaſon of aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of wheyiſh humor in the Body: In which <hi>Baubinus</hi> ſaith there are Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to be ſeen, which hinder the return<note place="margin">A Valve in the Vein.</note> of ſerum into the <hi>Vena cava.</hi> But Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teaches otherwiſe, for with their broad end they look towards the <hi>Cava,</hi> and with their ſharp and lunary part they reſpect the kidneys, by which they are opened, according to the Opinon of Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> which I have found true, and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by viſible Inſpection, ſo that any matter may eaſily repaſs, from the kidneys by the Emulgents to the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> in the ſolemn Circulation of the Blood. By a ſhort and crooked paſſage they are carried downwards to the hollow part of the kidneys, as alſo the <hi>emulgent Arteries,</hi> which are remarkable and large, derived from the Trunk of the Aorta, unto the kidneys, not ſo much to furniſh vital Heat, to reſiſt coldneſs, as to nouriſh the kidneys, and to purge away the wheyiſh humor, which is moſt plentifully contained in the Arterial blood. For theſe emulgent Veſſels are ſeldom one like another, or one in number, ſomtimes with ſix, five, four, three, and for the moſt part two branches, they go diſtinctly to the kidneys, and that either on the one or both ſides, ſeldom on one alone. And when they have entred the hollow part of the kidney, each branch is ſuddenly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into four or five little ones, which being again divided into other leſſer ones, they are at laſt ſpent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Veins and Arteries as ſmal as hairs, which end at the the Heads of the Caruncles, into which they ſhed their wheyiſh humor, that it may diſtil into the little Pipes of the Ureters: Yet are the Emulgents never opened at the Pipes of the Ureters. For wind or water being forced in, it flows indeed through the Emulgents, but it goes not out by the Pipes. Into the left Emulgent in ſome bodies there is implanted a branch of the <hi>Vena azugos</hi> ſo called, which is thought to be the cauſe of that Conſent which is between the Cheſt and the Kidneys, which the Arteries do not a little further.</p>

Moreover, the kidneys need no other Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to nouriſh them beſides the Arteries, as the <hi>Veſica bilaria</hi> or Choler-bladder, and the Piſs-bladder; for they do not draw a pure Excrement as thoſe do.</p>
               <p>The Kidney hath one very ſmall <hi>Nerve</hi> on each ſide, from the Stomach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch<note place="margin">Their Nerves.</note> of the ſixt pare, diſtributed into its proper Membrane, whence ariſes<note place="margin">Why ſuch as have a ſtone in their kidney are ſubject to vomit?</note> the Sympathy between the kidneys and the ſtomach, as when perſons diſeaſed in their kidneys, are troubled with ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach-ſickneſs and vomiting. But there are a few branches of Nerves, which proceed from about the beginnings of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Meſentery, part of which enters into the hollow of the kidneys with the Emulgents, and is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminated through their ſubſtance. Hence perſons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſtone in their kidneys, have more vehement gravative and ſtretching pains: But their pain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more ſharp, when the ſtone enters into the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and very ſenſible Ureters.</p>
               <p>Now this is the ſtructure of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys<note place="margin">The ſtructure of a Dogs kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note> in Mankind. For in a <hi>Dog</hi> it is <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,</hi> in whoſe kidneys there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cavities; but in the kidneys of a Man there are none, ſave what are formed by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgents and Ureters variouſly divided.</p>
               <p>Alſo there is a feigned Dream of ſome<note place="margin">The Cribrum benedictum of the Ancients.</note> of the Ancients, touching the <hi>Cribrum benedictum</hi> by them ſo called. For they feigned that there were in the kidneys, two Cavities ſeated according to their length: The one uppermoſt, into which the wheyiſh blood ſhould be poured out of the Emulgents, the other lowermoſt, which a certain tranſverſe Membrane was thought to ſever like a ſeive bored through with very ſmall holes, which made them call it the <hi>Colander,</hi> and the bleſſed ſeive, through which they would have the Serum ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Ureters, and the good blood to ſtay behind to nouriſh the kidneys. Theſe Dreams of the Ancients <hi>Veſalius</hi> did rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;<note place="margin">The Error of <hi>Veſalius.</hi>
                  </note> but he is mean while deceived, while he would have ſuch Cavities in the kidneys of men, as there are in Dogs kidneys, and wil not have the kidneys of a man or ſheep to be cut up, becauſe of the Fat. <hi>Riolanus</hi> defends this Opinion of the Colander or Seive, but he explaines it only of the Caruncles (as I do) which are pierced through with very ſmall holes.</p>

               <p>Their <hi>Uſe</hi> is to draw the wheyiſh<note place="margin">How the Urin is made?</note> blood, by the emulgent Arteries, that ſo the maſs of blood may be purged. The blood therefore going out through theſe Veſſels, is alwaies carried through the branches of the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, which are ſpred abroad through the whole fleſh of the kidneys, and go at laſt into very ſmall paſſages, ſo that at laſt the wheyiſh Humor is poured right out into the fleſh of the kidneys: But the ſanguine and laudable portion, does partly remain to nouriſh the kidneys, and partly returns by little emulgent Veins which are open into the <hi>Cava,</hi> and ſo to the Heart. The wheyiſh and watry part is ſtrained through the Papilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Caruncles, which have holes into the branches of the Ureters, which grow together into one large Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or Expanſion of the Ureter, into which the whey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41352:28"/>
humor is emptied, and through the Ureters into the Bladder, where it becomes urin. And becauſe urin is yellow, a portion of yellow Choler not drawn out by the Gall-bladder, is thought to paſs along with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum or wheyiſh humor that the Ureters might be clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Choler, as the Guts are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olhafius, Sennertus, Olaus Wormius,</hi> whom a great many others have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,<note place="margin">Whether the Kidneys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Seed?</note> as <hi>Hofman, Meybome, Horſtius, Loſeleus, Eichſtadius, Sperlinger,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have attributed to the Kidneys the preparation of Seed, becauſe hot Kidneys cauſe a propenſity to fleſhy luſt, and cold Kidneys indiſpoſe to Venery, and becauſe in Creatures that uſe Venery, the kidneys have a rank ſmell and taſt of Seed, which in guelded Animals they have not. Becauſe in a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhaea proceeding from aboundance of Sperm, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are ſucceſsfully applied to the kidneys: becauſe men are ſaid to proceed from the Loins of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, and they have been famed for the ſeat of Luſt: Becauſe the Loins being whipped, do raiſe an Appetite to Venery: And finally becauſe in perſons given up to luſt, the kidneys are conſumed. Which Arguments are indeed of ſome weight, unleſs perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture that ſmell and raſt happen to the kidneys, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are nouriſhed with ſuch a nutriment as is the matter of Seed, which is carried for the Generation thereof in bordering Veſſels. And when the kidneys are hot or cold, the neighbouring places are alſo hot or cold, through which the matter of Seed is carried, and in which it is altered, and therefore Seed may have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity to the Conſtitution of the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys. For <hi>Johannes Walaeus</hi> conceives<note place="margin">This Opinion reconciled with the Doctrine of Circulation.</note> that the Circulation of the blood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit this uſe of the kidneys, for blood is not carried from the kidneys to the ſtones, by the Emulgents and Veins: but it falls down only out of the Aorta by the Spermatick Arteries. But this action of the kidneys defended by ſuch Learned men, may be reconciled with the circular motion of the blood, if we ſhall ſay. 1. That the more wheyiſh part of the Arterial blood is drawn by the kidneys through the emulgent Arteries, whereby the reſt which deſcends right along through the Spermatick Arteries, becomes more pure and fitter to make Seed. Of which this is a ſign, that when the attraction of the kidneys is weak, and the blood comes to the ſtones more wheyiſh then it ought to be, the ſeed which is voided, is unfit for Generation, though plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in quantity. 2. That the neighbouring Sperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Veſſels are irradiated and virtuated by the kidneys, even as the Brain irradiates the lower Parts, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred property reſembling light. 3. If any thing ſhould be carried from the kidneys to the ſtones, we might very well ſay, it is a wheyiſh ſubſtance, which ſtirs up a ſharp titillation and ſtrong provocation and deſire to Venery. For I am not perſwaded by the Arguments of <hi>Helmont,</hi> that the ſalt of the Urin takes away the fruitfulneſs of the Seed, if it be moderate, ſeeing it helps the Seed both by its acrimony and fluidity or thinneſs of ſubſtance. Little Birds, indeed, though very laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, have neither kidneys nor bladder; yet they have ſomwhat that ſupplies the Office of the kidneys, viz. certain Caruncles or little parcels of fleſh, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the kidneys, which are continued with the <hi>Vena cava</hi> and <hi>Aorta,</hi> Witneſs <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beverovicius</hi> artributes a kind of Sanguification or Blood-making to<note place="margin">Whether the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys make Blood?</note> the kidneys. 1. Becauſe they have a Parenchy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> and very many Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. But they might have their Parenchyma becauſe of their Veſſels, that they might not be intangled one with another. And it was requiſite they ſhould have very many Veſſels, to the end they might plentifully purge away the Serum or wheyiſh part of the Blood, ſo that through very many and very ſmall outlets, the Whey might be iſſued out into the Caruncles, without any conſiderable quantity of Blood therewith. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Kidneys which in healthy perſons are red, clear, ſolid; according to the kind of the Diſeaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſomtimes obſcure and blackiſh, ſomtimes white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh; otherwhiles looſe, brittle, and as it were rotten; and ſomtimes again, hard and dried. But that might happen, becauſe as ſome other parts, ſo the kidneys might be ſick, or through ſickneſs of the Body, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction being ſomwhere hurt, they could not be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with good blood. 3. Becauſe the Urins of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons troubled with the ſtone are crude: But of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother cauſe is commonly rendred. Viz. in that the kidneys being ſtopped, the thinner part only of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin can make its way forth. 4. Becauſe perſons trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the ſtone are wont to ſwell and look pale, like thoſe that are termed <hi>Leucophlegmatici.</hi> But this may eaſily happen, becauſe the kidneys either through weakneſs cannot ſufficiently draw the wheyiſh humor out of the blood, or being ſtopped it cannot be duely expelled. But if he or any other ſhall affirm, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Circulation of the blood in theſe parts, the blood is there ſomwhat more changed, then it was in its ſimple Veſſel, I ſhall not diſagree with them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For themſelves it is that they change the blood, but it is for the reſt of the body only, that they purge out the wheyiſh Excrement.</p>

               <p>Now theſe Caſes are ſo ſcated, that they reſt upon the upper part of the kidneys on the outſide, where they look towards the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> being covered with Fat and Membranes.</p>

kidneys, peradventure becauſe they are moiſter then ordinary, and contain a more thin melancholy Juyce, which becauſe they do not ſtrongly enough expel, but treaſure it up rather, therefore theſe Caſes are widened. But in grown perſons they are ſtraitned, and become leſs, though they abound more with Melancholy, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the Melancholy being gathered by degrees, is through the ſtrength of nature by degrees expelled; partly, becauſe the Serum in hotter perſons is dried up, wherewith the new born Infant abounded; and partly becauſe as the Reins grow bigger, they are compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Yet I have once obſerved them in a grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by reaſon of aboundance of black Choler, twice as big as ordinary, whereas commonly they are no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then a large vomiting Nut.</p>

In Infants I have ſeen to my thinking wheyiſh blood in them. I admire that <hi>Riolanus</hi> could not, or would not ſee this Cavity, for though he cries that it is ſo ſmall, that it will hardly admit a little Pea, yet is it ſomtimes wider, and alwaies ſo large, as to contain many peaſen compreſſed, and we can thruſt a Probe into it, this way and that way, without violence. It contains therefore a large Cavity, reſpecting the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its Body. Nor hath Nature ever labour'd in vain, no not in the ſmalleſt ſpaces of the Capillary Veins. It is a ſmall matter which they can hold, yet it may be counted much, becauſe it is ſucceſſively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in, and caſt out again. This Humor might have been indeed allayed and ſweetned by the admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of blood, as Choler alſo might, yet Veſſels and Receptacles are ordained for both theſe Excrements, that the blood might not be polluted.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Shape</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> they many times reſemble the kidneys, ſave that<note place="margin">Their Shape and Subſtance.</note> their ſubſtance is a little looſer; ſo that they ſeem little kidneys reſting upon the great ones. Which perhaps was the Reaſon that <hi>Caſſerius</hi> did call them Auxiliary kidneys: But more frequently their ſubſtance is flat like a Cake (howbeit hollow within) and their ſhape is round-long and ſomwhat ſquare. Somtimes they are three corner'd, ſeldom round; for they are ſeldom ſeen in one and the ſame ſhape.</p>
               <p>They are <hi>knit</hi> where they reſt unto the external Membrane of the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys<note place="margin">Their Connexion.</note> ſo faſt, that negligent Diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, when they take out the kidneys, leave them ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Membrane of the Diaphragma or Midriff. And this is the Reaſon that many obſerve them not.</p>
               <p>They have <hi>Veſſels: Veins,</hi> and <hi>Arteries,</hi> derived to them from the middle of the<note place="margin">Their Veſſels.</note> Emulgents. Somtimes alſo a Vein is ſent thither from the kidney, and ſomtimes alſo a branch near the Liver from the <hi>Cava</hi> is brought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſomtimes alſo from the <hi>Vena adipoſa,</hi> and ſomtimes from all thoſe places, ſomtimes with a ſingle, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles with a double branch. Somtimes they have a ſingle Artery from the Emulgents, ſomtimes a double one; and otherwhiles they have from the Trunk of the Aorta, one while a ſingle branch, otherwhiles three together.</p>
               <p>Theſe Caſes have <hi>Nerves</hi> alſo. For about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Arteries of the Meſentery, ſome branches of Nerves mixed together are produced, one part of which goes unto the kidneys, and theſe Caſes which reſt upon them.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>uſe</hi> hath been hitherto unknown.<note place="margin">The uſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Authors Opinion.</note> If it may be allowed to conjecture, as doubtleſs it is, due conſideration being had to the Structure and Paſſages; we may ſay, that a thick and excrementiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous black-cholerick humor, is detained in theſe Caſes, which had not been purged from the Blood made in the Liver, or Spleen, or both, but eſpecially that blood which we formerly proved to be made in the Spleen; which is here kept and digeſted, becauſe it could not paſs through the narrow waies of the kidneys. Nor let the aſcending of an heavy ſubſtance trouble us, which ever and anon happens in the Body, by means of the expulſive and attractive Faculty of ſome Part; yea and vehement attraction is advantaged by the highneſs of Situation in motions Spiritual. Hence alſo perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture it is that Urins are ſomtimes black, when at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time this Humor is collected in the Caſes, in too great a quantity. Where alſo may be often doubtleſs, the ſeat of ſome morbifick cauſe, eſpecially of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. And the reaſon why melancholick perſons are thereby little pained, is becauſe the ſmallneſs of the Nerves, and the thickneſs of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, do render the Senſe dull. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned<note place="margin">According to <hi>Veſlingus.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Veſlingus</hi> agrees with me in this uſe, but he ſhews not whence, nor how the humor comes. For he conceives they help to draw the wheyiſh humor, and that they treaſure up a parcel of black Choler, which furthers the ſeparation of Whey from the Blood, like Runner. <hi>Olhafius</hi> will have them to receive the<note place="margin">According to <hi>Olhafius.</hi>
                  </note> thick and terreſtrial Excrements of the kidneys, which remain after their Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. And therefore becauſe a greater Bowel hath more Excrements then a leſſer, the Conceptacle for the right kidney was to be larger, and that for the left leſſer, and therefore the right ſide Caſe is greater then the left ſide, becauſe the right kidney is greater then the left. But no man hath thought of the waies by which the black blood ſhould be diſcharged into theſe <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulae</hi> or Caſes. The Arteries do eaſily occur to ſuch as hold the Circulation of the blood. For according to the old Opinion, a way is readily found to theſe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulae from the Emulgent, or from the Trunk of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ota it ſelf, which bringing Nutriment ſuch as it is, do withal unlade the Excrement of the Arterial blood, which was not evacuated formerly. But how it returns out of the Capſulae, how<note place="margin">How the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor comes out of the Caſes into the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.</note> it comes to the kidneys to colour the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins black, is not ſo eaſie to ſhew, for the Veins end in the Emulgents, or in the <hi>Cava</hi> it ſelf, ſeldom in the kidneys, and ſo either they ſhould perpetually keep that excrementitious Juyce, which is unlikely, or ſend it back again to the <hi>Cava</hi> and the Heart, or they ought, verily, to enter the kidneys directly by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgent Veins, without any hindrance by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motion of the blood going out of the kidneys. This contrary motion a thicker and ſtronger humor can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily overcome, manifold branches alſo oppoſing the ſame, as in Rivers we now and then ſee waters run contrary to the ſtream, by the banks and in the middle, by reaſon of ſome fountains opened.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their Situation.</hi> They run through many parts in their beginning, mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,<note place="margin">Their Situation.</note> and end. Their beginning is in the kidneys themſelves, what ever <hi>Hofman, Riolanus, Laurenberg,</hi> and <hi>Plempius</hi> ſay to the contrary; in which they riſe like Roots out of the Earth, and as a Vein out of the Liver. Nor does their ſimilitude with the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der move me; becauſe, 1. The Nature of the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is peculiar and diſtinct from them both. 2. They are not much unlike the belly of the kidneys. 3. All Parts do carry with them the nature and colour of their Original, as we ſee in the Aorta and the Cava. Nor does their cleaving faſt to the Bladder infer any thing, ſeeing the connexion is not greater there then in the kidneys, being conveniently ſeparable, between the Membrane of the Bladder and the Muſcle. And therefore this <hi>Original</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Original of the Ureters.</note> is in the kidneys, out of nine or ten little Pipes or Channels, to each of which the Caruncles aforeſaid are applied, though the Caruncles may be alſo applied to their middle part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bored through. Now thoſe Pipes go into fewer and greater branches, commonly into three, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the upper, middle, and lower Region of the kidney. Theſe grow afterwards into one large Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which goes out of the flat ſide of the kidney. The middle part, is the whole<note place="margin">Their Middle.</note> long-round Pipe or Channel, reſting upon the Muſcles of the Loins, between two Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Peritonaeum, with which</p>
               <p>The Ureters <hi>are faſtned;</hi> above to the kidneys, below to the Bladder,<note place="margin">Their Connexion.</note> with the inner ſubſtance whereof they make one continued Body, ſo that they cannot be pluckt away without breaking. Their <hi>End</hi> is, where they are implanted, being<note place="margin">Their End.</note> carried obliquely a fingers breadth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the proper Membrane of the Bladder, and its circumvolved Muſcle, not far from the Neck of the Bladder, in its hinder part. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the oblique Inſertion of the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<note place="margin">Why the Urin cannot go out into the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</note> (which cannot at al, or very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinder the regreſs of the wheyiſh Humor into the Ureters, becauſe it is broad) two little Membranes are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Implantation, like the Valves in bellows, ſhutting up the paſſage of the Ureters, ſo that the Urin cannot go back. Hence it is, that the Bladder being blown up, will not admit ſo much as any wind. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius, Riolanus,</hi> and <hi>Plempius</hi> deny theſe Valves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all other Anatomiſts. But though the paſſage be crooked, yet is it open enough. The Gut Colon is not a little wreathed, and the Ileon more then that, and yet they have a Valve affixed. Yea they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forced to confeſs, that the two Membranes clapt together, do exactly ſhut up the paſſage of the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and what hinders but that they may be termed Valves.</p>
               <p>As for their <hi>Magnitude.</hi> They are long-round Veſſels, thick and<note place="margin">Their Magnitude.</note> hollow, as big as ſtraws. But in Diſſections of perſons troubled with the Stone, we have often ſeen their Cavity ſo wide as to admit two fingers, yea and as big as the Guts.</p>
               <p>As to there <hi>Figure,</hi> they are round Veſſels like Water-pipes, a little crooked like the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Figure.</note> S.</p>
               <p>They have a double <hi>Membrane:</hi> The<note place="margin">Membranes.</note> one common from the Peritonaeum for ſtrength ſake, the other proper, like the inner ſubſtance of the Bladder, and continued therewith, white (whence ſome and <hi>Celſus</hi> among the reſt call them the white Veins) bloodles, nervous, thick, ſtrong furniſhed with ſtraight and crooked Fibres, that they may be ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
               <p>They receive ſmall <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> from<note place="margin">Veſſels.</note> the neighbouring Parts.</p>
               <p>They have <hi>Nerves</hi> from the ſixt pare, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the Loins. Whence they have an exquiſite ſenſe, and are pained when ſtones paſs through them, which ſenſe of pain is encreaſed, by the diſtention of theſe membranous Bodies, cauſed by great ſtones.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Uſe</hi> is, that through them as Conduit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes,<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> the Urin ſeparated from the Blood by the kidneys, may be carried into the Bladder; and ſomtimes Gravel and Stones, Worms, Pins, Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The <hi>firſt Membrane</hi> is outmoſt and common, from the Peritonaeum, ſtrong<note place="margin">Membranes.</note> and thick.</p>
               <p>The <hi>other</hi> is inmoſt, and proper, thin, of exquiſite ſenſe, interwoven with all kind of Fibres, that it may admit of much diſtention and contraction [wherein there are very many wrinkles, in perſons troubled with the ſtone, and little cavities are engraven which hold ſtones, being cauſed through long want of diſtention] And it is covered with a<note place="margin">The Cruſt of the Bladder.</note> fleſhy Cruſt, or wrinkled Coat as it were, made of the Excrements of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41352:30"/>
by the ſharpneſs of the Urine.</p>
               <p>That which is in the middle, betwixt this proper and the outmoſt Coat, is by others called the ſecond proper Membrane, which nevertheleſs they grant to be thick, and furniſhed with fleſhy Fibres.</p>
               <p>But it is rather a <hi>Muſcle</hi> encompaſſing the whole Bladder: becauſe it hath Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres<note place="margin">The expulſive Muſcle of the Bladder.</note> viſibly fleſhy, inſerted into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the bladder: So that, as the circular Muſcle called Sphincter, does cloze the bladder, that our water may not paſs from us againſt our wills, ſo this Muſcle does help the voidance of our water, whileſt by contracting it ſelf, it ſqueezes the bladder. And this is, indeed, the Opinion of my Maſter <hi>Aquapendent;</hi> the truth whereof <hi>Walaeus</hi> was wont thus to prove in the Diſſection of live Dogs: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cut off all the Muſcles of the Abdomen, he makes a ſmall piercing wound into the bladder, out of which wound or hole, the urin ſpins out as far, as naturally it does from the Yard: yet I ſhal not refuſe to grant thus much to other Authors: Viz. that the Muſcles of the Abdomen or Belly, do alſo help forward the Expulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Urin. It ma es nothing againſt us, that the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and Guts, and Womb, have the like fleſhy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane; for they alſo did need ſuch an one, that they might more eaſily be widened and contracted. Hence, though the Membrane of the Bladder be more fleſhy, yet in a large ſenſe, the Membrane of theſe other parts may likewiſe be termed muſculous. But the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spirituous blood, forcibly iſſuing forth, and of a dull and lazie urin are different. Moreover, in the Veins, the precedent blood is forced on by that which follows, according to the Laws of Circulation, and the inbred Faculty.</p>
               <p>The Bladder hath three <hi>Holes:</hi> Two a little before the Neck, where the Ureters<note place="margin">Its Holes.</note> are inſerted, of which before, the third is in the Neck, to let out the Urin.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Neck</hi> of the Bladder, is its nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower<note place="margin">Its Neck.</note> part, through which the Urin is voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In <hi>Men</hi> this Neck is more <hi>long-round, narrow,</hi> and a little writhen, becauſe being placed under the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which compoſe the Yard, it is carried upwards, under the Share-bones, from the Fundament to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of the Yard: To which in the hinder part two Kernels are adjoyned, called the <hi>Proſtatae.</hi> In <hi>Women</hi> the <hi>Neck of the Bladder</hi> is <hi>ſhort and broad,</hi> ſtretched forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right downwards, and implanted above into the Neck of their Womb. In both Sexes the Neck is fleſhy (which therefore heals, being wounded, whereas wounds in other parts of the bladder are deadly) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with very many Fibres, eſpecially ſuch as run athwart, which purſe up the Neck of the bladder, that our water may not paſs from us againſt our wills, and this orbicular Muſcle is<note place="margin">The Sphincter Muſcle.</note> therefore called the <hi>Sphincter.</hi> Which if it be over cooled, or troubled with the Palſie, or any other Diſeaſe, the Patient cannot hold his water.</p>
               <p>The Bladder hath <hi>Veins,</hi> termed <hi>Venae Hypogaſtricae,</hi> implanted into the ſides of its<note place="margin">Its Veſſels.</note> Neck, which being variouſly diſtributed through the bladder, are mutually conjoyned one with another, and with the Arteries, and are penetrable by mutual holes from one to another, ſo that the blood may eaſily paſs out of one branch into another, according to the Obſervation of <hi>Sylvius,</hi> that the nutritive blood brought in by the Arteries, may return by the Veins. Now the reaſon why the Bladder hath Veins, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it draws a meer Excrement, viz. the Urin, with which it cannot be nouriſhed.</p>
               <p>It hath <hi>Arteries</hi> from the Hypogaſtrica in Men, in Women from the Veſſels which go into the Neck of the Womb.</p>
               <p>It hath conſiderable <hi>Nerves</hi> from the ſixt pare, and from the <hi>Medulla</hi> of <hi>Osſacrum.</hi>
               </p>

For by reaſon of the intricate mixture and intertexture of the Veſſels, no part goes back, ſave what the ſtones diſmiſs, as not neceſſary for themſelves, nor the whole Body. And therefore we do for the moſt part find the Arteries which bring the blood greater, and the Veins which carry it back leſſer, becauſe the Stones do not return ſo much as they receive. And that the Spirit is retained, the ſilent courſe of the blood through the Veins, is a token. Which blood, verily, is retained in the ſtones from flowing back, by the ſame power whereby it is retained in other Parts of the Body.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Figure</hi> of the Stones is Oval.<note place="margin">Their Figure.</note> Which Figure varies ſomtimes, by reaſon of the neighboring Veſſels more or leſs turgent: And therefore ſome ſay the <hi>right</hi> Teſticle is more full vein'd, and it is thought to be more hot, and have ſeed better digeſted. Whence <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls it the <hi>Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getter,</hi> becauſe it receives more pure and hot blood and Spirits out of the great Veſſel, viz. the great Artery.

Whence that common Saying, Wenches are begot by the left Stone in the left ſide of the Womb; Boys by the right Stone in the right ſide. And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaies, <hi>there is in a man as wel as in a woman both male and foemale Seed,</hi> that is to ſay, hotter and colder. But I am not of Opinion, that wenches are alwaies begotten by the left Stone, and that it receives a colder ſort of Seed, for, 1. There are ever and anon <hi>Virago's</hi> or manly Women, which exceed Men in ſtrength and courage. 2.

Howbeit the left parts of the body are generally ſaid to be colder then the right.</p>
               <p>Moreover the right Stone is fuller of Seed, doth ſwel more, and hath a greater Vein and Artery, ſo that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems to deſign the Generation of Foemales more then of Males.

Alſo in the Carnal conjunction, they draw back the Stones, that the Seed-channel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhortned, the Sperm may be ſooner and eaſier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh'd into the Womb. In ſome perſons theſe Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are capable of voluntary motion, who can draw up, and let down their Stones as they liſt: where theſe Muſcles are doubtleſs ſtronger then ordinary, that they may not only hold the Stones ſuſpended, but move them from place to place.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Stones is, by their<note place="margin">The Efficiens cauſe of the Seed.</note> Heat and inbred Faculty, to make ſeed. For the Efficient cauſe of Seed is the proper fleſh or ſubſtance of the Stones, both in regard of their hot and moiſt temper of their ſpecifick Property; ſince no fleſh in the Body is found like that of the Stones. Now they turn the blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared into Seed, which is requiſite to preſerve the Species of Mankind: And that which remains o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above, either goes back by the Spermatick Veins into the Heart, or turns to nouriſhment for the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41352:32"/>
Stones. Nor can Seed be ordinarily<note place="margin">Without the Stones there is no Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> bred without the Stones, nor perfect Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals without them, for from them the Seed receives both its form and colour. That ſome have ingendred without Stones, though not according to the ordinary Courſe of Nature, <hi>Smetius</hi> in his Miſcellanies, <hi>Fontanus</hi> in his Phyſica, <hi>Cabrolius, Hofmannus de Generatione,</hi> and others, do teſtifie. Now the place wherein the Seed is bred, is not any large Cavity in the Stone, but certain very ſmall Veſſels therein formed, covered with a very deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate thin Coat, as <hi>Veſalius</hi> rightly teaches. Now theſe following Authors after <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> have taken away the faculty of Seed-making from the Stones, viz. <hi>Fallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius, Cabrolius, Poſthius, Caſparus Hofmannus, Caeſar Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moninus, Adrianus Spigelius, Regius,</hi> and others, becauſe the Matter of Seed does not go into the Stones, nor is there ever any Seed found in them. But they wil have them principally to be Receptacles for the wheyiſh Humor which flows in with the Blood; which they collect from their glandulous ſubſtance, and the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the left Stone. But they are confuted by Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs and gelt perſons, whoſe Stones being cut out or bruiſed, they become unable to engender. Alſo Seed hath been frequently obſerved in the Stones. Witneſs <hi>Dodonaeus</hi> in his 39. Obſervation touching a Spaniſh Soldier, <hi>Hofman de Generatione</hi> Chap. 18. <hi>Carpus</hi> and <hi>Riolanus.</hi> It is indeed not to be found in ſome Bodies, becauſe it was not bred, by reaſon of ſome ſickneſs, or Impriſonment, or upon Death the Spirits being diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, a watry Liquor appears inſtead thereof. Nor can the Seed come to the <hi>Vaſa deferentia</hi> otherwiſe then by the Teſticles, which begin at the Stones, as the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory Veſſels end in them, by the Obſervation of very many Anatomiſts, and why the left Stone is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the right, another reaſon is alleadged by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men.</p>
               <p>Alſo the <hi>Stones</hi> ſeems to give ſtrength and courage to Mens bodies, as may<note place="margin">The Sympathy of the Stones with the whole Body,</note> be ſeen in gelded perſons, who are changed well-near into Women, in their Habit of Body, Temperament, Manners, &amp;c. And doubtleſs the ſtones do exceedingly ſympathize with the upper Parts of the Body, eſpecially with the Heart. For we ſee that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial and cooling Epithems in fainting Fits and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Noſe, being applied to the Stones, do help as if they were applied to the very Heart and Part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. The Cauſe hereof is hard to tell; <hi>Jaccbinus, Laurentius, Hofmannus,</hi> conceive that it comes to paſs by reaſon of Paſſions of the Mind, which are joyned with fleſhly Luſt. But Eunuchs alſo are luſtful, for they are great Lovers of Women: And Eunuchs are often tranſported with anger and other Paſſions of the Mind, but they receive not never the more the Habit of Men. <hi>Galen</hi> ſeems to have been of Opinion, that a Spirit was bred in the Stones and diffuſed thence al the Body over. But glandulous Bodies of the number of which the Stones are, are unfit to engender an hot Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; nor are there any Paſſages about the Stones, for the diſtribution of that new Spirit, according to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Galen.</hi> Nor is therefore the Opinion of <hi>Mercatus</hi> allowable, viz. that thoſe Spirits are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed bred there; but that the Vital Spirits are collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Stones in great quantity, that from them they may return back into the whole Body; for thoſe which are there collected, are collected to engender Seed. But the Opinion of <hi>Thomas a Vega</hi> does better pleaſe me, til I ſhall find a more probable, viz. that a Seminal Air is raiſed up in the Generation of Seed, which thus changes the whole Body. The fleſh truly of ungelt Creatures, hath a rammiſh taſt of the Seed, which the fleſh of ſuch as are gelt hath not. This Vapor or Air of the Seed is carried to the Heart, either by the inner Pores of the Body, or by the Veins which reconveigh to the Heart the ſuperfluities of the generated Seed. <hi>Helmont</hi> imagines the Stones do act by a ruling power, at a diſtance, as the ſtomach does upon the Womb, the Womb upon the upper Parts, and that without any right waies or marks; which nevertheleſs an Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſeeks to find, if it be poſſible. <hi>Veſtingus</hi> ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly makes the reaſon of the change of voice, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, ſtrength, &amp;c. in perſons guelded, to be the oppreſſion of their inbred Heat by plenty of Matter, which ought to turn to Seed. Now their Sympathy with the Heart, depends partly upon the Nerves, partly (for we hold the Circulation in the Stones) from the foreſaid Veins, returning back to the Heart, by which both the vertues of Cordials aſcend, and of cooling Medicaments, even as we apply Cordials and Coolers to the Hands, with like ſucceſs.</p>

               <p>WEE have propounded the Spermatick praepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Veſſels above, which end into the Stones, to which they carry Matter to make Seed.</p>
               <p>Now there are other Veſſels, which begin at the Stones, and end at the Root of the Yard, whither they carry and there ſquirt out the Seed, which hath been made in the Stones. And theſe are termed <hi>Vaſa defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia,</hi> or Veſſels that carry away the Seed; and they are two in number, on each ſide one.</p>
               <p>Now we divide theſe Veſſels into the Beginning, Middle, and End.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Beginning</hi> are termed <hi>Paraſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Paraſtatae.</note> as if you would ſay idle atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon the ſtones, ceremonious waiters, alſo <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra varicoſa</hi> or <hi>variciformia,</hi> becauſe they are twiſted and wreathed, like thoſe crooked black Veins called <hi>Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Galen</hi> in his Interpretation of hard words uſed by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls them <hi>Epididymides,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Names.</note> becauſe they reſt upon the ſtones, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs others diſtinguiſh by a peculiar uſe, as that they prepare the ſeed; and the Paraſtatae do add more perfection thereto: Others invert the Matter, and perſwade themſelves that the Paraſtatae prepare the ſeed, and the Epididymides finiſh it, which Opinion of theirs they have received, I know not how well, from the ancient Phyſitians. And they are oblong Veſſels, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon the ſtones, white, thick, and round, a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and ſolid, growing narrow by little and little.</p>
               <p>As for their <hi>Subſtance,</hi> tis of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle nature betwixt that of the ſtones<note place="margin">Their Subſtance.</note> and that of the <hi>Vaſa deferentia.</hi> For their ſubſtance is ſofter then the latter, and harder then the former, becauſe they are glandulous within, and fungous; and externally membranous.</p>
               <p>As to their <hi>Original,</hi> the Opinion of<note place="margin">Their Riſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Spigelius</hi> and other late Anatomiſts, does againſt all former Authority thus determine: viz. that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41352:33"/>
they ariſe by continuation from the Seminary Veſſels, ſo that both the Praeparatory Veſſels, and the Paraſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae, and the Out-carrying Veſſels, are but one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body, receiving divers Names according to its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parts, and their reſpective Offices and Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Walaeus</hi> conceives, that it is more ſuitable to what appears in Diſſection, to ſay, that theſe Veſſels do not ariſe from the praeparatory Veſſels, but are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mixed with them, faſtned to, and opened into them: and that as he ſuppoſes, to the end that the blood forced in by the Praeparatory Veſſels, may depoſite that Matter which it contains fit to breed ſeed, into the little branches of the <hi>Vaſa deferentia.</hi> But the reſt of the blood, which is unfit for Nutrition and Generation of Seed, is by other Anaſtomoſes ſhed into the Veins, and by Circulation returns to the Heart.</p>
               <p>Now they have their Original from the ſtones. by means of innumerable ſmall Pipes or white Fibres. And there is no communion at all between the Veſſel that carries away the Seed, and the Veins, and Arteries of the ſtones, which <hi>Veſalius</hi> conceives to be apparent in Diſſections. Yet are they faſtned to the inmoſt Coat of the ſtones, though they have a proper Coat of their own.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Paraſtatae, is to perfect and finiſh the ſeed, by a power which they<note place="margin">Their Uſe.</note> receive from the ſtones. Moreover, while the ſeed abides in them, it comes to paſs that vehement and frequent Luſt is not provoked.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ejaculatory</hi> or ſquirting Veſſels, are ſimply ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Middle, becauſe they carry ſeed from the ſtones and the <hi>Corpora varicoſa,</hi> to the ſeminal bladders: for they are ſeen to carry a whiteiſh Humor, yea and the Paraſtatae are frequently found full of ſeed.</p>
               <p>They have a <hi>Subſtance</hi> white and nervous; and their <hi>Figure</hi> is round and long: They have an obſcure <hi>Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> becauſe the ſeed by means of the ſpirits whereof it is full, does eaſily paſs.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Situation</hi> is partly in the Cod, partly in the Cavity of the Belly, above the <hi>Os pubis</hi> or Share-bone. For they are carried upwards, and are knit to the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory Veſſels, by a thin Membrane, and ſo paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Flanks and the Share-bone, which for that cauſe have a ſlight Cavity. And afterwards being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back downwards, they are carried above the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and under the hinder part of the Bladder, above the <hi>rectum Inteſtinum,</hi> they are on each ſide widened at the Neck of the Bladder, where</p>
               <p>Their <hi>End</hi> is, and theſe Veſſels ſo widened do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſeminary Bladders,</hi> which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in number like little Cells, and ſeem<note place="margin">See Fig. III. Tab. XXI.</note> to make on each ſide one remarkable, great, and winding one, becauſe one goes into another, which you cannot compare to any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing better then to a bunch of Grapes. The Cavities do neatly repreſent the Cells of a Pomegranate in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and figure. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> did firſt of al deſcribe theſe Bladders, and after him <hi>Fallopius.</hi> Theſe nervous Bladders are ſeated between the Ligaments of the Piſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bladder and the Arſe-gut, by the ſides of the deferent Veſſels, a little before the ſaid Veſſels grow thick, and unite.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to contain the ſeed being wrought, and to reſerve the ſame til time of Copulation, ſo that there may be ſeed ſufficient to beget many Children. And therefore that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And that ſeed is contained in theſe<note place="margin">Whether ſeed is contained in the Bladderkies.</note> little Bladderkies, beſides the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Fallopius, Platerus, Laurentius, Aquapendent,</hi> and <hi>Caſſerius,</hi> it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by this Experiment: If you ſqueez them, preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly feed is forced into the Pipe of the Yard, juſt like Milk out of the Dug, or piſs out of the Piſs-bladder, &amp;c. But if you preſs the Proſtatae with your finger, yet nothing comes<note place="margin">Whether in the Proſtatae?</note> away, unleſs you preſs the Bladders alſo. And that the ſeed does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually diſtil and drop out of them, into Urinary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, a little Caruncle hinders, which ſtops their hole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The perpetual ſeat of a virulent Gonorrhaea, hath been by the Obſervation of late Anatomiſts found to be in theſe Bladders, for upon Diſſection there hath been found an evident Impoſthumation in theſe parts. From the ſituation of theſe Bladders and of the ſtones, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Cavity of the Abdomen, <hi>Riolanus</hi> would give a reaſon why men are not ſo cruelly infeſted with the filthy vapors of corrupt ſeed, as women are. But the Peritonaeum does not hinder the evaporations of the ſeed, becauſe the Veins do inwardly open upwards. Alſo <hi>Viragoes</hi> or manniſh women, are not troubled with the ſaid vapors. The reaſon muſt therefore be ſought in the quality of the ſeed, which being in men and manly women more benigne, does neither go to, nor infect the Heart.</p>
               <p>After the Conſtitution of the ſeminary Bladders theſe deferent Veſſels are united into one ſmal paſſage which goes into the Proſtatae.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> as if you<note place="margin">See Tab. XXII. Let. QQ.</note> would ſay the Waiters, are two Kernels, manifeſty differing from the ſeed bladders, in uſe, form, ſituation, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, though <hi>Hofman</hi> think otherwiſe; their</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Situation</hi> is at the Root of the Yard, above the Sphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter or Muſcle of the Bladder, on each ſide, at the neck thereof. <hi>Columbus</hi> calls them <hi>Proſtatae, Veſalius glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duloſum corpus, Fallopius glanduloſion aſſiſtens,</hi> others call them the little ſtones, to difference them from the true ſtones. Before and behind they are flat, on the ſides round.</p>
               <p>They are commonly as <hi>big</hi> as a Walnut.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Subſtance</hi> is ſpongy, and yet harder and whiter then that of other Kernels, and they are covered with a thicker Membrane; all which is to hinder the ovlie ſubſtance, of it ſelf apt to run, from paſſing out. And becauſe they are of exquiſite ſenſe, therefore they cauſe pleaſure in Copulation. Theſe Kernels are open by certain Pores into the Urethra or Piſs-pipe, which is evidently apparent in ſuch as have died of the Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaea, of which Gonorrhaea theſe Pores being dilated are many times the ſeat.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Uſe</hi> is to contain an oylie, ſlippery, and ſat Humor, which is preſſed forth when need requires, to daub the Urinary paſſage, to defend it from the acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ſeed or urin, and that it may not fall in through drineſs, but may remain ſlippery; becauſe through it in Copulation, the ſaid Humor does ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly flow out of the ſeed.</p>
               <p>This is that which <hi>Galen</hi> ment, when he ſaid that they contained a certain Humor like ſeed, but much thinner, the uſe of which Humor, is to excite Luſt,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41352:33"/>
and to cauſe Delight in Carnal Copulation.</p>
               <p>Mean while, <hi>Spigelius, Riolanus,</hi> and others do conceive that they contain<note place="margin">Whether the Proſtatae do make ſeed.</note> ſeed, which is there collected, and thence voided, having attained ſome further perfection, as <hi>Veſlingus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives. Others as <hi>Laurentius,</hi> conceive they do both; for he will have the Proſtatae both to thicken the ſeed, and to breed a thin humor, and excite titillation. But that they do not contain ſeed, their compreſſion ſhews, which voides none, unleſs the Veſicles or ſeed-blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be withal compreſſed. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeat of the Gonorrhaea is here,<note place="margin">The ſeat of the Gonorrhaea.</note> which we frequently obſerve to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue many years, without any remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Detriment to Health, it is unlikely that the ſeed flows from the Proſtatae. I ſaw a man at <hi>Padua,</hi> who was troubled thirty years with the Gonorrhaea, and hath it ſtill, being otherwiſe in Health. The ſeed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not contained in them, nor does it ſtay there, though it may paſs through.</p>
               <p>Others do conceive, that they help to make the ſeed, yea that they and the<note place="margin">The Proſtatae do not help to make ſeed.</note> bladders are the only ſeed-makers, as <hi>Regius</hi> endeavors to prove. Which if it were true, guelded perſons might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender. Guelded perſons do indeed ſend forth a moiſt matter reſembling ſeed, and they are provoked to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, but they can get no Children. And if they have been obſerved at any time to engender, according to what is related of guelded Horſes and Bulls; there was doubtleſs remaining in the ſeed-bladders, ſo much ſeed made by the ſtones, as might ſerve for one bout of Generation. But if they engendred more then once, doubtleſs one ſtone was left behind, when they were guelded.</p>

                  <hi>Chap. XXIV.</hi> Of the Yard.</head>
               <p>THe Genital Member of a Man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly<note place="margin">Its Names.</note> called in Latin <hi>Penis a penden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> becauſe it hangs, alſo <hi>Virga</hi> the Rod or Yard, <hi>Colis,</hi> &amp;c. Many other Names are wont to be put upon it, which are better paſt over then mentioned. In Engliſh tis moſt uſually termed the <hi>Yard</hi> or <hi>Prick. Plato</hi> in his Timaeus compares it to a certain living Creature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath an Appetite to Generation. Howbeit, it is indeed the Part and Inſtrument of a Live-wight, and the Faculty of Appetite is ſeated in the Brain.</p>
               <p>Tis <hi>ſeated</hi> at the Roots of <hi>Os pubis,</hi> that carnal Copulation might more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently<note place="margin">Situation.</note> be accompliſhed, and that it might be no impediment to other parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is placed in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, becauſe only one in number. Yet there was once a man diſſected at <hi>Bononia</hi> who had two Yards. Which alſo <hi>Obſequens</hi> relates of a Boy, among his Prodigies. Another named <hi>Anna,</hi> being lately a vagrant in <hi>Italy,</hi> had no Yard, but inſtead thereof a certain piece of ſpongy fleſh under his Navil, which Nature had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided him to piſs withal.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is round and long; but not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, becauſe it is broader on the upper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Its <hi>Magnitude</hi> conſiſting in thickneſs and<note place="margin">Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude.</note> length, does vary, both in the ſeveral ſorts of Animals, and in the Individual Creatures of the ſame ſort. <hi>Particularly,</hi> tis in Man ſo great as was neceſſary to propagate his ſpecies or kind: But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally ſhorter then in many Brutes, becauſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind couples after another manner then thoſe beaſts do. In particular Men, there is exceeding great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. For it is for the moſt part greater then ordinary, 1. In little Men. 2. In ſuch as abſtain from carnal Embracements, if we beleive <hi>Galen.</hi> 3. If the Navil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings be not tied cloſe to the Navil in Infants; for otherwiſe, by reaſon of the Urachus or Piſs-pipe, the Bladder and neighboring Parts, are drawn more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Yet <hi>Spigelius</hi> is herein of a quite contrary mind. 4. In ſuch as have large Noſes. For the proportion of the Yard anſwers that of the Noſe very much, if we will beleive Phyſiognomiſts. 5. In Block-heads and dull-pated Aſſes. Some Nations have this Member larger then ordinary, as the Aethiopians or Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores.</p>
               <p>It conſiſts of the Scarf-skin, Skin, fleſhy Membrane, and a proper ſubſtance of its own.</p>
               <p>It is void of <hi>Fat,</hi> even in the fatteſt<note place="margin">Why the Yard is void of Fat, the firſt Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>Laurentius</hi> his Error.</note> men. And it is a great queſtion why there is no Fat found either in it or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. Some, as <hi>Laurentius,</hi> think it is becauſe fat through its ſoftneſs would hinder its erection: But the Yard will ſtand, as long as the Bodies thereof are blown up. Others make the Cauſe to be leaſt the weight thereof ſhould do hurt, and that the Yard might not grow too great. But if there were a little Fat, it would add nothing to the weight, nor would it enlarge the Yard over much. The truer Cauſe therefore is this, that there is therefore no Fat, that its ſenſe might not be dulled, and the pleaſure of Copulation abated, when the Fat ſhould melt by rubbing the Yard.</p>
               <p>Its proper <hi>Subſtance</hi> is not boney as it is in a Dog, a Wolf, a Fox, a Whale,<note place="margin">Its Subſtance.</note> &amp;c. but peculiar and proper to it ſelf, ſuch as is no where to be found in any<note place="margin">The four Parts of the Yard.</note> other Part of the Body. Now there are four proper Parts of the Yard, the Urethra or Piſs-pipe, the Nut, and the two nervous Bodies.</p>
               <p>The URETHRA or Piſs-pipe, is a nervous<note place="margin">Urethra.</note> Pipe or Channel, alwaies of the ſame ſize, from the neck of the bladder (to which it is joyned, but does not ariſe therefrom, nor communicate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with) like a long neck, to the End of the Yard; ſave where the Nut is joyned with the nervous Bodies.

It is exceedingly widened in perſons trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the ſtone. <hi>Alpinus</hi> ſaw it ſo wide in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that it would receive a large Hazel-nut. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is eaſily blown up, to draw out the ſtone.</p>
               <p>In the beginning thereof are thoſe Pores, through which we ſaid before the ſeed ſtills forth. There is alſo a <hi>little Membrane</hi> or Caruncle like a Valve ſtretched before it, to keep the ſeed and urin from returning into the ſpermatick Veſſels. It is eroded or fretted by ſharp Humors, or by uſe of the Catheter, whence follows a perpetual Gonorrhaea. <hi>Riolanus</hi> obſervs that it is found in Boys, till the twentieth year of their Age, but I ſee no cauſe why it ſhould not remain in their after Age, when the encreaſe of ſeed, makes it more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then formerly.</p>

and <hi>Recutiti,</hi> skinleſs or skin-cut. In which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tis wonderful what <hi>Veſtingus</hi> told me himſelf ſaw, viz. that in young Boys it grows out ſo long and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it reſembles a tayl. <hi>Hildanus</hi> obſerved it in a certain perſon very great and fleſhy. At the lower end it is tied to the Nut by a Membrane or Band termed <hi>Fraenum</hi> the Bridle, which is terminated in the hole of the Nut. Some will have it to be made up of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the Nerves. <hi>Carolus Stephanus</hi> thinks it is compoſed of a Combination of the Tendons of the Muſcles of the Yard, and a Nerve.</p>
               <p>The <hi>two nervous Bodies,</hi> on each ſide<note place="margin">The nervous Bodies.</note> one, do make up the remaining and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the Yard: the whole ſubſtance whereof is like a moſt thick ſpungy Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſtuffed with fleſh.</p>
               <p>For the ſubſtance thereof is twofold, the firſt exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, compact, hard, and nervous; the other internal, ſpungy, thin, and hollow, and of a dark-red colour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to black; and therefore <hi>Veſalius</hi> ſaies tis filled with a great deal of black Blood, like a Pudding.</p>
               <p>Now this ſubſtance is rare and pory,<note place="margin">Whence the hardneſs and Erection of the Yard pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</note> that it may be filled with Spirit, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Arterial Blood; by which means the nervous ſubſtance thereof is the more ſtretched, and the Spirits are not ſoon diſſipated, whence proceeds the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtiffneſs of the Yard, not ſo much for Copulations ſake, as that the man might ſquirt his ſeed right out as far as might be, even to the Orifice of the Womb, after the Yard hath been moved in the female Privity.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Bodies have their Original from the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer parts of the Hip-bones, as from a firm and ſtable Foundation, to which they are ſtrongly tied with two Ligaments; where in their Riſe they keep ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that place may be allowed to the Urethra; and then they are carried upwards, and grow into one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the Share-bone (like the two horns of the letter y) but ſo as they do not both remain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but they looſe near a third part of their nervous ſubſtance. Howbeit they remain diſtinct, by the coming between of ſome membranous partition (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not of a double Membrane, as at the Riſe of the Bodies, but of one ſingle one) very thin and tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſtrengthned with nervous and ſtrong tranſverſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres; which fibres are ranked and ordered like a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Comb.</p>
               <p>All kind of <hi>Veſſels</hi> enter into the Yard, <hi>Nerves, Veins,</hi> and <hi>Arteries. 1. External</hi> ones running in the Skin, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequent, from the <hi>Pudenda,</hi> and alſo internal ones ſpred through its Body. They are therefore miſtaken, that think the Yard is deſtitute of Veins. Its internal <hi>Arteries</hi> are two remarkable ones, ariſing from the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogaſtrica, which are inſerted at the beginning of the growing together of the Bodies, and are ſpred up and down, according to the length of the Yard, But in the middle, where the Septum or partition is thinneſt, they ſend branches up and down, through the ſpaces of the Fibres, the right Artery into the left Body, and the left Artery into the right Body, carrying Spirit and Blood, to blow up, erect, and nouriſh the Yard. The Nerves alſo are diſſeminated from the Marrow of <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> through the Yard, as well the external and Skin-nerves, as the internal, and thoſe remarkable ones, which aſcend through the middle of the forked diviſion, and are thence diſſeminated into the Muſcles, the whole Body, and the Nut; that there might be an exquiſite ſenſe and delectation.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Yard hath two pare of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Muſcles of the Yard.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt pare</hi> ſhort and thick, are the Yard Erectors; this pare ariſes nervous, under the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Yard, from an Appendix of the Hip, and growing fleſhy, it is carried to the bodies of the Yard, into which it is inſerted, not far from their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Uſe</hi> is to raiſe and keep the Yard up in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond Pare which widens the Urethra</hi> is longer, but thinner or leaner. Theſe two fleſhy Muſcles ariſe from the Sphincter of the Fundament, following the length of the Yard: then they are carried beneath and inſerted into the ſides of the Urethra, about the middle thereof.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to widen the lower part of the Piſs-pipe, both in piſſing, and eſpecially in Copulation, when the bodies of the Yard are full, that the Egreſs of the Seed may not be hindred. And in theſe Muſcles is the place where Surgeons do commonly take out ſtones. The Line of the Cod being drawn to one ſide, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their length, and not according to their breadth as <hi>Marianus ſanctus</hi> notes againſt the Ancients, an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Catheter being thruſt into the Ureter, upon which, the Inciſion is to be made, which manner of cutting <hi>Aquapendent</hi> deſcribes and approves of.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Yard is for Copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note place="margin">Copulation.</note> which a man cannot rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form without the Erection of his Yard, and the ſquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the Seed which follows thereupon. For the man ſquirts his Seed right out into the Mouth of the Womb, where being afterward joyned with the womans Seed, an drawn in, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Womb, Conception is ſaid<note place="margin">Conception.</note> to be made.</p>
               <p>A ſecondary <hi>Uſe</hi> thereof is to void urin, yet was it not therefore made, ſeeing women do make water without it. By reaſon of this twofold uſe of the yard, the Arabians make two paſſages, as <hi>Veſalius</hi> tells us, who obſerved ſuch a like Conformation in a certain perſon.</p>
               <p>In ſome the Nut of their Yard is not bored through in the ſore part where it ought to be, but in the lower part, as <hi>Hofman</hi> hath noted out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Paulus,</hi> who cannot make water if their Yard do not ſtand, or when they ſit. Others, and that more frequently, have it imperforated in the upper part. They are both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt for Generation. Somtimes the Yard hath no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage at all as <hi>Julius Obſequens</hi> hath obſerved.</p>

Which Conceits falling to the ground by their own weakneſs, I ſhall proceed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Parts.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41352:35"/>
in their Number, Original, and Office, &amp;c. I muſt now therefore only tell you wherein they differ.</p>
               <p>They differ firſt in <hi>Magnitude.</hi> Theſe Veſſels in women are ſhorter, becauſe<note place="margin">How they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from thoſe in Men.</note> of the ſhort way they are to go, but therefore they have many turnings and windings which make up the <hi>Corpus va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricoſum:</hi> to the end the ſeed may ſtay long enough to receive due preparation. In the next place they differ in their Implantation. For in women they are not totally carried to the ſtones, but they are divided in the middle way: and the greater part goes to the ſtone, and makes the <hi>Corpus varicoſum,</hi> and the leſſer part ends into the womb, into whoſe ſides it is diſſeminated, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to the upper part of the bottom, for to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the Womb and the Child therein; and that by thoſe Veſſels ſome part of the menſtrual blood may be purged forth in ſuch as are not with Child. For the leſſer branch being tripartite, is below the ſtone divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three branches, one of which, as was ſaid, runs out into the womb, the other is diſtributed to the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Veſſel or Trumper of the Womb, and to the round Ligament; the third branch creeping along the ſide of the Womb through the common Membrane, ends near the trueneck of the womb, inſinuating it ſelf alſo among the Hypogaſtrick Veins, with which and the Arteries, they are joyned by Anaſtomoſes. Of which ſee <hi>Zerbus, Fallopius, Platerus,</hi> and others, who have ſhewn <hi>Riolanus</hi> and my ſelf the way. That is a rare caſe, which is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured out by <hi>Beſlerus,</hi> viz. for the ſpermatick Arteries to be joyned by way of Anaſtomoſis with the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Artery. For this cauſe in women theſe Veſſels go not out of the Peritonaeum, nor reach to the Share<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone: becauſe the Stones and Womb are ſeated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeminal Veins and Arteries are intertwined with many wonderful Anaſtomoſes, for the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeed. Yea and the Veins do receive into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Hypogaſtrick Arteries of the Womb, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Obſervation of <hi>Arantius</hi> and <hi>Riolanus.</hi> Yet I remember the Arteries were wanting in a woman that had bore male Children, and <hi>Franciſcus Zanchez</hi> relates how they were turned into ſtone in a woman of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe.</hi>

                  <item>8. In <hi>Connexion;</hi> for they are knit unto the womb by two manifeſt paſſages, or rather the one of them is an obſcure one, out of which during carnal Copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is ſhed, not a wheyiſh ſubſtance, but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeed.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Their <hi>Uſe</hi> is to make ſeed which helps to generate after its way and manner: which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> againſt all Reaſon and Experience, was bold to deny to women, in ſome places of his Writings, contrary to the expreſs Doctrine of <hi>Hippocrates de Genitura,</hi> where he tells us that women alſo ſend forth ſeed out of their Bodies, ſomtimes into their womb, whereby it is moiſtned, and ſomtimes without, if the Orifice thereof do gape over much. Now that in the Womb it helps to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he thereby demonſtrates, in that if after Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. The woman ſhal not conceive, the ſeed which they have both of them voided, does flow out of the womb. But ſome other Anatomiſts deny that theſe ſtones do make ſeed. But they will have them to be meet Kernels, to receive that moiſture which needs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the womb, which is the Opinion of <hi>Cremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> or that they are only made for a mark and ſign, which was the Conceits of <hi>Rhodiginus,</hi> and of <hi>Hofman</hi> ſince him, who account them rather Carcaſſes of ſtones then true ſtones, becauſe they are ſmall, void of Juyce, and uncompact. But as for what concerns Humidity we deny that Argument, and ſay 1. That there was no need of ſo much preparation to water the womb. One Veſſel gently carrying a wheyiſh Humor, might have ſerved that turn, yea the Pores alone might have ſufficed, as it is well known to happen in a clammy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor diſtilling into the Knee. 2. They may anſwer both Intents, viz. Generation and Irrigation. 3. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience tells us that ſeed and no other humor hath iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out of the ſtones of women being diſſected. <hi>Guin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius</hi> was hindred in his Diſſection, by the plentiful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption thereof. The nocturnal pollutions of women teſtifie the ſame, and women became barren, when in ancient times they were guelded or ſpayed, Witneſs <hi>Athenaeus. Galen</hi> experimented the ſame in Sows. <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> writes that Cows being guelt, do conceive if they go to Bull preſently after. 4.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> Of the Veſſels that carry away the Seed, eſpecially the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of the Womb.</head>
               <p>COncerning the Veſſels which carry away the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male-ſeed, the Doctrine of Anatomiſts hath been hitherto ſomwhat intricate, partly through varity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and partly the obſcurity of the matter it ſelf, which nevertheleſs I ſhall endeavor to reduce, and as much as may be to illuſtrate the ſame.</p>
               <p>The <hi>deferent Veſſels</hi> are taken either in a large or a ſtrict ſignification. Strictly for thoſe ſame obſcure Paſſages and Veſſels only, which carry part of the ſeed bred in the ſtones, into the womb. <hi>Largely</hi> and <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> 1. For the preparatory Veſſels alſo, 2. For them and the <hi>Womb-trumpet,</hi> which others refer to the ſervatory and jaculatory Veſſel. I ſhall ſpeak of both briefly and diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>deferent Veſſels</hi> are properly thoſe ſmall paſſages derived from the ſtones, either to the bottom of the womb, with a very ſhort paſſage, or diſſeminated at the trumpets of the womb, with ſundry, and thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſmall Twigs, reſembling the <hi>Venae lacteae,</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the ſpermatick preparatory Veſſels, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with them, however here they change their name and uſe, becauſe they immediately paſs over, and lick the ſtones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> conceives that the former is only inſerted into the ſides of the womb, which are termed <hi>Cornua,</hi> or the wombs horns, and other Anatomiſts are of the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, who profeſs they could find no other Inſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But <hi>Zerbus, Fernelius, Laurentius,</hi> found another Branch herefrom, which goes not into the bottom as the former, but into the Neck, ſo that one part of this deferent Veſſel which is the ſhorter but larger, is inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the middle of the Horn of the ſame ſide, and there poures out ſuch ſeed as it hath, into the Cavity of the womb: but the other part being the narrower and longer, is carried along the ſides of the womb, below the Mouth, to the beginning of the Neck. <hi>Varolius</hi> hath alſo made mention of this Part, and ſaies it is ſo ſmall in ſuch as have never conceived, that it cannot be found, ſave by a skilful Anatomiſt, but in Women with Child it is very large. <hi>Spigelius,</hi> becauſe he could not ſomtimes find it, did count it a ſport of Nature. <hi>Veſtingus</hi> does ſeem to allow of it, ſeeing he brings ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Matter from the ſtones, to the bottom and ſheath of the womb, this way. I ſhould willingly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Opinion of <hi>Spigelius,</hi> becauſe it is ſeldom ſeen. Little Branches indeed are alwaies diſſeminated unto the neck of the womb, but the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of theſe Veſſels is, partly to carry the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Matter to the Trumpets, that it may be there fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accompliſhed, and better wrought, and reſerved for further uſe, and partly to the bottom of the womb. Where another Branch ends into the Neck, the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Humidity is voided this way alſo, cauſing greater delight by reaſon of the length of the way.</p>
               <p>The other <hi>deferent Veſſel,</hi> which ought to keep the Seed before it be ſquirted out, is the <hi>Trumpet</hi> of <hi>the Womb,</hi> by <hi>Fallopius</hi> ſo called, from the likeneſs it hath to a Trumpet of War, which he thus deſcribes. There ariſes a ſeminal Paſſage, ſmall and very ſtrait, nervous, and white, from the Horn of the womb it ſelf, and when it hath gone a little therefrom, it grows broader by little and little, and criſps it ſelf like the tendrel of a Vine, till it comes towards the end. Then diſmiſſing its wrinkled Criſpations, and becoming very broad, it <hi>ends</hi> into a certain Extremity, which ſeems membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and fleſhy, by reaſon of its red Colour, and at laſt becomes very torn and ragged, like the jagged ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of worn clouts, and hath a large hole, which lies alwaies ſhut, thoſe jagged ends alwaies falling in upon it, which nevertheleſs if they be diligently opened and widened, they repreſent the broad end of a brazen Trumpet.</p>
               <p>I ſhall handle the Particulars more diſtinctly. The <hi>Trumpets ariſe</hi> from the bottom of the womb by one end, nor do they reach with their other end to the Stones, or any other remarkable Part. And therefore they are not manifeſtly paſſable in this other Part, but ſhut up and blind, ſo that they are like the <hi>Inteſtinum caecum,</hi> and are as it were an Appendix of the Womb. But this ſhutting up may be made according to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Fallopius,</hi> which <hi>Riolanus</hi> who was ſince him, challenges for his own, by the fringes and jagged ends of the Trumpets, falling together, like Raggs of Cloath.</p>
               <p>They are two in <hi>Number,</hi> on each ſide one.</p>
               <p>They are <hi>ſeated</hi> ſo as to compaſs half the Stones, but they are diſtant from the Stones, on every ſide, near half a fingers breadth, unleſs the womb be diſeaſed, by which they are drawn up nearer to the Stones. They are ordinarily faſtned only by very thin Membranes, not unlike the wings of Bats or Flitter-mice, through which many Veins and Arteries are diſſeminated, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from the Stones into theſe Paſſages, and carrying Seed out of the Stones.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Subſtance</hi> is nervous, white, thick and hard.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Figure</hi> is round and hollow. Somtimes their Cavity ſo praeternaturally widened, as to contain a Mole, which <hi>Marquardus</hi> relates in his <hi>Empirica Praxi;</hi> ſomtimes a Child, Examples whereof are recited by <hi>Riolanus.</hi> Nor could he ſee any other waies for the mans ſeed to enter, ſave the turning and winding Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of thoſe Veſſels. But in a living woman, the mans ſeed full of ſpirits, might eaſily be drawn thither, by the widened waies of the womb miſaffected, which Paſſages being afterwards (Conception being made, and the Trumpets diſtended) ſhut up, were not ſeen by Diſſectors. Or whether hath there not been a ſhape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Mole, or a Child without life been ſhaped, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſeed of a Man, of the Mothers ſeed only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Trumpets; which having received no life from any Father, and the paſſages being ſhut up, it grew great, and kil'd the Mother?</p>
               <p>In the Natural <hi>Figure</hi> let us conſider the Beginning, Middle, and End. The Inſertion o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Beginning</hi> is at
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41352:36"/>
the bottom of the womb large, where it attains a ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Pipe, ſtretched out to the middle well-near of the Trumpet, hollow, that it may tranſmit the Seed to the bottom of the womb. The <hi>Middle</hi> being capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſhews certain little Cells, containing white ſeed. The <hi>End</hi> is narrower, though it carry ſome wideneſs with it. Howbeit before the End, it is wreathed and criſped like the tendrel of a Vine, as is viſible in Men and Beaſts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Paſſage</hi> therefore of the Trumpets, is not in all parts ſtraight, but winding, becauſe the way is ſhort from the ſtones to the womb. But the pleaſure ought not to be ſhort, when the ſeed is poured plentifully out of the ſtones into the horns of the womb in Copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And look what the <hi>Seed-bladders</hi> are in Men, as to preſerve the ſeed, theſe blind paſſages may be the ſame in Women, when they couple oftentimes, and ſtil void ſeed. For they may be ſo termed, becauſe they are annexed to the ſtones by little Membranes, that by Veſſels brought to them from the ſtones, as by the milkie and meſaraick Veins, they may eaſily draw the ſeed by them concocted, and lay it up within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for future occaſion, and ſend it forth when need requires.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Uſe</hi> is, 1. According to <hi>Fallopius</hi> to ſerve as Chimneys, by which the ſooty vapors of the womb may exhale. Which I for my part cannot believe. For the ſooty Vapors are condenſed, and being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into water, are reſerved till the time of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, or aſcend by inſenſible Pores, or breath out at the mouth of the womb, both in Women with Child, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the mouth of the womb is never ſo cloſe ſhut as to hinder, as the Examples of Superfoetation teſtifie, as in ſuch as are not with Child. Nor can I wel tel how the ſooty vapors ſhould find way through theſe croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Paſſages. 2. According to the ſaid <hi>Fallopius</hi> in his Obſervations, they make ſeed, becauſe he alwaies found ſeed in them, but never ſaw any in the ſtones; to which I anſwered before. 3. Their true Uſe is, to draw ſeed out of the ſtones, by blind paſſages of the Veſſels diſperſed through the Membrane, and when it is drawn to perfect the ſame by ſome tarriance in the Tendrels and Cells, by the irradiation of the vertue of the ſtones; that it may be more fit for a Child to be made of; finally to carry it to the womb, eſpecially in the Act of Copulation, by thoſe little Pipes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the Horns of the womb, that it may meet the mans ſeed in the Cavity of the womb or its Neck, to cauſe Conception.</p>

               <p>THe Womb is by the Latins termed <hi>Uterus,</hi> from <hi>Uter</hi> a Bottle by reaſon of its hollowneſs, in which Senſe <hi>Tacitus</hi> does uſe <hi>Uterum Navis</hi> for the Keel of a Ship. <hi>Iſidorus</hi> ſaies tis ſo called, becauſe tis on each ſide one: in a more large ſignification tis termed <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in the <hi>Digeſts</hi> and <hi>Inſtitutes.</hi> Alſo tis called <hi>Matrix, Utriculus,</hi> and <hi>Loci muliebres,</hi> where conſiſt the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Generation, according to <hi>Varro.</hi> In other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, according to <hi>Pliny,</hi> tis termed <hi>Vulva,</hi> eſpecially in Sows, which the ancient Romans did account a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Diſh: Of which ſee <hi>Plutrach,</hi> and <hi>Langius</hi> in his Epiſtles, alſo <hi>Martial, Horace, Apitius, Athenaeus,</hi> and among late Writers <hi>Caſtellanus. Hofman</hi> conceives that <hi>Vulva</hi> is corrupted from <hi>Bulga,</hi> and <hi>Bulga</hi> a Word uſed by <hi>Lucilius</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi> is originally French, if we believe <hi>Feſtus,</hi> who renders it a Bag. <hi>Nonius</hi> interprets it to be a Satchel or Knapſack hanging about a Mans Arm. See hereof <hi>Voſſius.</hi> But the term <hi>Vulva</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by <hi>Celſus,</hi> and the Authors formerly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>ſituate</hi> in the Hypogaſtrium, or<note place="margin">Why the womb is placed in the Hypogaſtrium.</note> the lower Part of the lower Belly, which is framed in the Cavity termed <hi>Pelvis,</hi> by the <hi>Osſacrum</hi> and the Flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones. And therefore that <hi>Pelvis</hi> or Baſin, is larger in Women: and therefore they have Buttocks greater and wider. Now it was requiſite that it ſhould be ſo placed, that the Womb might be diſtended according to the greatneſs of the Child, and that the Child might be conveniently excluded.</p>
               <p>Moreover the Womb is placed in the middle incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to no ſide, ſave ſomtimes when a Woman is of Child with a Boy or a Girl: for then the Child lies more to the right or left ſide, though that be no certain Rule.</p>
               <p>Now it lies between the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum</hi> or Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gut, which is beneath it, and the Bladder which lies upon it, as between two Pillows. Why therefore ſhould we be proud who are bred between Dung and Urin?</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Magnitude</hi> is conſidered in length<note place="margin">Its Magnitude.</note> depth, and thickneſs, and all theſe vary in reſpect of Bodies, Age, and Venery.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Length</hi> in thoſe of a middle ſtature, who uſe Venery, from the external Privity to the bottoms end, is commonly eleven fingers; the bottom is three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Breadth</hi> of the bottom, is two or three fingers, becauſe in Women not with Child the latitude of the bottom and neck is one and the ſame. And hence the amplitude may eaſily be conjectured.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>Virgins,</hi> which have not attained to ripeneſs of Age, it is little and leſs then the Bladder: in ſuch as are full of Age it is greater: yet if they abſtain from Venery it is ſmall enough, though thick, as it is alſo in very old Women. But it is greater in ſuch as have oft conceived, and bore Children: that a man may well near graſp it in his hand, unleſs when the Women are great with Child: for then it is more and more enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and whereas before Gravidation, the bottom of the Womb did not paſs beyond the beginning of <hi>Osſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum,</hi> it reaches afterward to the Navil and beyond, ſo that it reſts upon the thin Guts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>thickneſs</hi> of the Womb does va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Whether the womb becomes thinner in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child.</note> after the ſame manner.

               <p>The <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> accompanying one another, are carried between the Coats of the womb, and pour forth their Blood into thoſe membranous Pipes of the womb, but are not carried into the inmoſt Cavity of the womb.

Thoſe Veins and Arteries which come <hi>from beneath</hi> and aſcend, do ariſe from the Hypogaſtrick Branches of the <hi>Cava</hi> and the <hi>Aorta,</hi> and creep through the neck of the womb, and the lower part of the bottom, where they are every where joyned with the ſuperior ones.

And they may be eaſily obſerved, if in dead Bodies ſome of them be blown up. For they all ſwell by that blaſt into one. The Mouths of theſe Veſſels or Pipes rather, do enter into the Cavity of the bottom, and are called <hi>Acetabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> or <hi>Cotylidones</hi> Cups or Saucers: which gape and are opened, when the Menſtrua are purged.

For it is not probable, that that blood comes out of the womb: for the Child would be ſuffocated, and through too great opening of the internal mouth of the womb, Abortion might follow.</p>

Certain it is, that all the Particles of the Seed, have a peculiar Determination, referring to that Part of the Body of the Parents, from whence they came, and which they are to form in the Child.

Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens are hatched out of the Eggs, only by the ſitting of the Hen or ſome other Bird, alſo in a bed, in the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Furnaces of <hi>Aegypt, Tuſcany, Denmark,</hi> and Seeds of corn do ſprout upon Chamber-floures, without the aſſiſtance of any womb. 2. The external Members would ſooner be ſhaped then the internal. 3. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould contribute nothing to the ſormation of the Child. 4. No cauſe could be given of the likeneſs of the Child, ſomtimes to the Father, otherwhiles to the Mother. Now the Followers of <hi>Des Crates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt <hi>Regius</hi> do aver, that the Particles of the Seed are agitated only by the Heat of the womb and of the Seed, and they being agitated, in regard of their figures, do neceſſarily fall into the Branch of a Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wight, juſt as when the oblong Particles of Salt, agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in water by the force of Heat, and joyned one with another, do firſt make a plate, and by the frequent multiplication thereof a four ſquare grain or corn, and as of ſix little balls agitated upon ſome plane and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together a Roſe is made; and as of the Particles of Vapors ariſing out of Cellars in cold weather and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſmiteing upon their doors, with a whirling mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſundry pictures of the patts of Plants are formed. And out of the ſaid Branch or Stalk, by little and little the whole ſhaping of the Child is perfected without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny underſtanding of the Soul, or any corporeal Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, directing the ſame, as in the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes of Glaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers after a Bubble of Glaſs is rudely cut, Gloves, Boots, and other things are blown by ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that come to ſee the works; and in ſome Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, by reaſon of the figures of the Pores in the Pipes, we ſee Images formed by force of the water breaking forth. A neat way, truly, of Conception and Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the womb, if it were true. No man is able in this Matter to trace the Workmanſhip of Nature. But I cannot as yet perſwade my ſelf, that all things are done rudely and mechanically in the Body, who have alwaies had an higher Opinion of Nature then ſo.

they could ſnew us ſome example, which their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers will never be able to do.

For the Heat and Virtue of the Seed and Blood would expire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could be mingled in the Glaſs, and it would be a very hard matter, to get the Seed of a woman to mingle among the reſt.</p>
               <p>That Conception hath been made, and a Child for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of the womb, ſome Examples teſtifie. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trumpet of the womb, I ſpake before, from the Relation of <hi>Riolanus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Child con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a womans Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</note> That a Child was conceived in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach of a young woman the Wife of an abominable Taylor, and voided by her mouth the length of a mans finger, but well ſhaped in all Parts external and internal. <hi>Salmuth</hi> informs us, deſcribing the Story from the Letters of <hi>Komelerius</hi> to <hi>Gothofredus Hofmannus,</hi> nor does he doubt of the truth of the Story. That the ſame may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the neck of the womb, thoſe Superfoetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeem to demonſtrate, which are voided in the firſt place to make more room for the larger Conception in the womb. But theſe are to be accounted very rare and praeternatural caſes, if true. But Superfoetation, whether in the womb or without, depends from the virtue of the womb, reaching all over the whole Body thereof.</p>
               <p>The womb is therefore neceſſary to preſerve the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> or kind. Howbeit it contributes alſo to the health of the Individual, as the emunctory or clenſer of the whole Body. Howbeit very many women have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very long, and happily without it, witneſs <hi>Abenzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, Aegineta, Wierus, Zacutus.</hi> When it hath fallen out putrified, it hath been all in a manner cut off without danger, according to the Obſervations of <hi>Rhaſes, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, Mercurialis, Langius, a Vega, Paraeus, Baubinus,</hi> and others. <hi>Fernelius</hi> tells us he ſaw a childing woman, who voided with her Child her whole womb, pluckt away by the roots, without danger of life. <hi>Saxonius</hi> relates other Stories of like Nature. <hi>Saronus</hi> ſaies that Sows are made more corpulent in <hi>Galatia,</hi> by cutting out their wombs. <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us that Sows were hung up by their ſore Legs, and had their ſtones and wombs cut out, that ſo looſeing the uſe of Venery, they might become more fat and delectable to the Palate. Nor is it without reaſon, becauſe the womb is the Mother of many Diſeaſes, by reaſon of the Obſtruction of the narrow Veſſels, and the ready falling down of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which when the womb is away, are more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purged out by a larger paſſage.</p>
               <p>Moreover another action of the womb is ſaid to be a certain Natural motion:<note place="margin">The wombs motion.</note> whence <hi>Plate</hi> would have the womb to be a certain <hi>Animal</hi> or Live-wight, and <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> ſaies it is an Animal in an Animal, becauſe of its motion. For in carnal Copulation, and when it is poffeſſed with a deſire to conceive, it is moved now up and then down, and gapes to receive the Yard, as a Beaſt gapes for its Food. And ſomtimes it is moved downwards, to expel the Child and Secondine, with ſo much violence, that it falls out.</p>
               <p>Moreover it is moved with, rejoyces in, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with ſweet ſmelling things: but it ſhuns ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrong ſmelling things, as Caſtoreum, Aſafoeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, &amp;c. Hence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies, that women with child will miſcarry at the ſmell of a Candle-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Even as we ſee al the Spirits recreated, by ſweet ſmelling things, not in reſpect of the ſmell preciſely, but of the vapor conjoyned therewith, which is familiar and acceptable to the Spirit. And therefore the Genital parts of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are the ſooner affected, becauſe they have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding quick Senſe. And becauſe ſweet ſmelling things have good and pleaſing Vapors joyned with them; and ſtinking things have filthy and ugly Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors; therefore by the latter, the Spirits are made more impure, and becauſe the womb is full of Spirits, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe is delighted with ſweet and fragrant things, and abominates ſuch as are ſtinking.</p>
               <p>And nevertheleſs, ſome women are<note place="margin">Why ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling things do hurt ſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> found whoſe wombs are badly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, who are put into Fits of the Mother by ſweet ſmelling things, and cured by ſuch as ſtink: becauſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being provoked to Expulſion by the latter, does with the ſtinking Vapors expel the morbifick Matter. But with the former filthy Vapors are ſtirred up in the womb, which before lay hid, ſo that they aſcend to the Midriff, Heart, Brain, &amp;c. whence proceed ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Fits of the Mother. Now theſe Vapors aſcend partly by the ſenſible Pores, and partly by the Veins running back, and carrying the ſaid Vapors with the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terine Blood: for I cannot allow of the power <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> aſſigns to his ruling Parts, without manifeſt and known Paſſages. Now the womb it ſelf does not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, nor is it moved out of its place, unleſs being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended, it takes up more room then ordinary, nor does it roule up and down like a Bowl or Globe in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Belly, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Fernelius</hi> have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. Nor do the horns of the womb being ſwelled, move any more then the womb it ſelf, as <hi>Riolanus</hi> ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, for they are faſtned by their Membranes, and they cannot ſhed their Seed into the Belly, the waies being ſtopped, but Vapors have an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Beſides its Senſe of Smelling, Taſting, Feeling, it is furniſhed according to <hi>Helment,</hi> with a kind of brutiſh Underſtanding, which makes it rage, if all things go not according to its deſire. But theſe things favor of the Opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> who improperly did compare the womb to a living Creature. Whence that fury proceeds, I have already declared. As for what that ſame Novelliſt <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaies, that it lives many times, and keeps a coile after a woman is dead, no man will eaſily believe it. For its life depends upon the life of the whole Body; and if it ſtir after death, either that motion proceeds from winds, or from a Child ſeeking its way out, after the Mother is dead, as ſundry Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples demonſtrate. <hi>Sphinx Theologico-Philoſophica,</hi> tells us that the Mother being dead, a Child ſuddenly iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of her womb, and cried luſtily. After which manner <hi>Laurentius</hi> deſcribes the Birth of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Manilius. Eberus</hi> hath two Examples of a Child born after the Mothers death, as alſo <hi>Johannes Matthaeus,</hi> and the like caſes are freſh in the memory of many here at <hi>Hafnia.</hi> But in oppoſition to <hi>Winchlerus, Sperlingerus,</hi> and others that deny it, we muſt obſerve, 1. That the Child muſt neceſſarily be ſtrong. 2. That the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Mothers womb muſt be large. 3. That the Mother being dead, the mouth of the womb muſt be widened, and her Thighs ſpred, or elſe the Child will be ſtrangled before it can come forth.</p>

                  <hi>Chap. XXIX.</hi> Of the Bottom of the Womb, and its Mouth.</head>
               <p>WEE have treated hitherto of<note place="margin">See Tab. XXVII.</note> the Womb in General, and its ſimilar Parts. The <hi>diſſimilar Parts</hi> follow, into which we have divided the ſame: viz. the <hi>Bottom,</hi> the <hi>Neck,</hi> and the <hi>Privity,</hi> with the Parts annexed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fundus</hi> or Bottom of the womb, is that part which reaches from the internal Orifice to the End up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. We divide it into the lower and narrower part and the larger upper part; to which we ad a third part viz. the Mouth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>lower and narrow</hi> part, is that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Mouth of the womb, and<note place="margin">The ſhort Neck of the womb.</note> the beginning, largeneſs thereof, and it may be called the ſhort Neck, to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference it from the true and long Neck. For before the wideneſs of the womb begins, between it and the inner Mouth, there interceeds another Neck as it were, or narrower Channel, then the largeneſs of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and this is obſerved both in Man and Beaſt. And <hi>Fallopius</hi> is of Opinion, that this part was called the Neck of the womb by the Ancients, as <hi>Galen, Soranus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pinaeus</hi> reckons this part to be as long as a mans thumb, I have obſerved it to be five fingers breadth, long in a Doe.</p>
               <p>The Cavity hereof is not large, but ſuch as will admit a Probe or large Quil.<note place="margin">Some Cauſe of Barrenneſs.</note> It is rough, leaſt the Seed which hath been drawn in, ſhould flow out again, as happens in ſome barren women, which have this part ſlippery, by reaſon of bad Humors. This roughneſs ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from wrinkles, which according to the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Pinaeus,</hi> have their Roots ſituate beneath, and their Edg tending inwards or upwards, that they may eaſily admit, hardly let go any thing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>large</hi> and <hi>upper Part</hi> is chiefly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Fundus</hi> or the Bottom, and this Part<note place="margin">The Bottom.</note> is properly called the Womb or <hi>Matrix,</hi> and it is the principal Part for whoſe ſake the reſt were made, being wider and larger then the reſt.</p>
               <p>It is ſeated above the <hi>Os pubis</hi> or Share-bone, that it may be there dilated and widened.</p>
               <p>The womb hath in a woman only one Cavity, not diſtinguiſhed into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">No Cavities or Cells in the womb of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> Cells, as ſome falſly attribute ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſeven Cells. In Brutes it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly divided into two parts, and therefore thoſe parts are called the two Horns of the womb: though the<note place="margin">Why Horns are ſaid to be in the wombs of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> form of Horns is not conſpicuous in all Brutes, but in Cows, Does, Sheep, Goats, &amp;c. Howbeit in imitation thereof, Authors have attributed horns to the wombs of women, becauſe on the ſides of the bottom thereof, there is on each ſide ſome protuberan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, where the deferent Veſſels are inſerted. But the womb of a woman is very ſeldom divided into two parts, as it is in Beaſts, as it hath been obſerved in ſome by the <hi>Brother</hi> of <hi>Baubinus, Sylvius, Riolanus,</hi> and <hi>Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens</hi> before them. And I doubt whether their wombs be ſo divided, who bear two or more Children at a Birth. The laſt year many women at <hi>Hafnia</hi> bore Twins contrary to their cuſtom, yea and ſome three Children at a Birth, which they never did before nor ſince. We muſt not therefore account that to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Families, or attribute the ſame to the wombs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing double, which properly belongs to the Seed. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that they are not conceived in a double womb, the womb-cake teſtifies, which alone is ſufficient for many Children, only it hath ſo many ſtrings faſtned to it in ſeveral places, as there are Children, as <hi>Beſterus</hi> hath lately deſcribed it in a like Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Yet is it divided into the right and left part. In the former Boys are for the moſt part ingendred: in the latter Girls. And it ſeldom happens otherwiſe, if we believe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen.</hi> Hunters have this ſign whereby they known whether the Beaſt they hunt have a male or female in her belly, for if when ſhe is ſtruck dead, ſhe fall on her right ſide, they conclude ſhe is big of a Male, becauſe the burthen ſhe goes with is moſt weighty on the right ſide; if on the left ſhe fall, they judg it is a Female. Tis reported that women with child of a Boy, do lift their right foot higher then their left, as they walk, as <hi>Salmuth</hi> gives us to underſtand, all which ſigns are nevertheleſs fallacious. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and his followers do reckon other ſigns, which are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for this place.</p>
               <p>The right and left ſide are differenced by a Line or Seam which ſticks up obſcurely, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> termes the Median Line. The like Line is ſeen in the lower Belly under the Navil, dividing that Region into two parts, which they conceive to be then more viſible, when women bear twins. But in ſome women with child I have ſeen this Line manifeſt, who bore after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards only one Child.</p>
               <p>The outward Surface is ſmooth and even, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered as it were with a watry Humor. The inner part hath many Poroſities, which are Mouths, through which in the time of a womans going with child, blood eaſily paſſes out of the Veins of the womb to nouriſh the Infant.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to receive the Seed, contain the Child, nouriſh it, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Orifice or inner Mouth of the womb</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The inner O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice of the womb.</note> is oblong, and tranſverſe, but very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row (but when it gapes, it is round and orbicular, which is perhaps the cauſe why the German Midwives call it the Roſe, and the French Midwives, the Crown of the Mother) like the Hole of the Nut of the Yard, that no hurtful thing may enter in, nor the Seed drawn thither, eaſily paſs out. If at any time it fall out of the Privity, or be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned inſide out, it reſembles exactly the Mouth of a Tench.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Situation</hi> thereof be changed, ſo that it be not juſt in the middle, looking towardst he bottom, tis conceived a Man cannot ſquirt his Seed thereinto, and that the Seed will ſooner flow back, then the woman conceive. If it be quite abſent, which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom falls out, an uncurable Barrenneſs<note place="margin">Some Cauſes of Barrenneſs.</note> is thereby cauſed. As alſo Barrenneſs is cauſed, if it be otherwiſe affected, viz. with Cancers, ſcirrhous Tumors, Obſtructions, Calloſity, over much Fatneſs: eſpecially through o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much Humectation and Relaxation, either through over much Copulation as in Whores, or through too great a Flux of Humors.</p>
               <p>In women with child a glewiſh clammy Matter grows to the Orifice, and fills the ſhort Neck well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>near; that theſe Parts being moiſtned, may more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be opened in the time of Travel.</p>
               <p>Within the Channel of this Mouth to the lower part thereof, grows its little bunch, which does more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He alſo informs us that about this little bunch, there are to be ſeen Pores or little Holes, which ſeem to be the ends of the deferent Veſſels, ending at the Neck. <hi>Columbus</hi> found thoſe Veſſels implanted like the teeth of a comb, full of Blood.</p>
               <p>By this Orifice, the womb draws the Seed into it, which being conceived, it is<note place="margin">The Uſe of the Orifice of the womb</note> ſaid to be ſhut ſo cloſe, that the point of a needle cannot enter. And therefore Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians do vainly ſquirt Liquors thereinto with a Syringe, and Whores endeavor in<note place="margin">When the Mouth of the womb is opened.</note> vain to draw out the Conception. But it is opened in Superfoetation, in the Ejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a bad Conception without hurt to the Child, which ſomtimes happens in the Emiſſion of Seed, but it is eſpecially opened after a wonderful manner at the time of Child-birth, when it ought to be widened according to the greatneſs of the Child, ſo that the wideneſs is in a manner equal from the bottom of the womb to the Privity, whereout the Child paſſes. And this ſaies <hi>Galen</hi> we may wonder at, but we cannot underſtand. And he admoniſhes us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion, that it is our duty to acknowledg the Wiſedom and Power of him that made us. But this Orifice as well as the womb, does chiefly conſiſt of wrinkled Membranes, which being ſmoothed out, will admit of unimaginable Dilatation.</p>

               <p>IN the Bottom of the Womb we have<note place="margin">See Tab. XXVII.</note> obſerved three things; the <hi>Bottom</hi> it ſelf, the <hi>leſſer Neck,</hi> and the <hi>Orifice.</hi> In the greater Neck alſo, three things are to be noted. The <hi>Neck</hi> it ſelf, the <hi>Hymen,</hi> and the <hi>Mouth of the Bladder.</hi> Of the Hymen we ſhall treat in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Neck</hi> or Channel of the womb, is by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo ſomtimes called <hi>Matrix,</hi> and the Door of the Womb, <hi>Fallopius</hi> calls it <hi>Sinus pudoris,</hi> the Privity. It is a long Channel, being hollow even when the Child is in the womb, admitting both a Probe and a mans finger, as may be ſeen in ſuch as are new born.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>ſituate</hi> between the external and the internal Mouth, receiving the Yard like a ſheath.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Figure.</hi> The Neck is ſomwhat writhen and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, alſo it is ſhorter and ſtraiter, when it is looſe, and fals together; that the internal parts may not be refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated. But it is ſtraight and widened 1. In carnal Copulation. 2. In the monthly Flux. 3. In the time of Child-birth, when it is exceedingly ſtretched according to the Shape of the Child; whence alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the exceeding great pains of women in travel: and then as alſo during their Courſes, women are very much cooled.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Magnitude.</hi> The length thereof is eight fingers breadth commonly, or ſeven; ſo as to be as long as a Mans longeſt finger. It is as wide as the <hi>Inteſtinum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi> or Arſe-gut. But the longitude and latitude of this part are ſo various, that it is hard to deſcribe them. For in carnal Copulation, it accommodates it ſelf to the length of the Yard, and this Neck becomes longer or ſhorter, broader, or narrower, and ſwells ſundry waies according to the luſt of the woman. And when that happens, the Caruncles ſwell with Spirits which fill them, as appears in Cows and Bitche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> deſire Copulation; but the Channel is made narrower and leſs, as alſo in the Act of Generation, that it may more cloſe embrace the Yard: and therefore its</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Subſtance</hi> is of an hard and nervous fleſh, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſpungy, like the Yard; that it may be widened and contracted within, the upper part is wrinkled, when it is not diſtended, but<note place="margin">Wrinkles in the Neck of the womb.</note> being widened, it is more ſlippery and ſmooth. Howbeit in the Neck of the womb alſo when it is diſtended, there are many orbicular wrinkles in the beginning of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel near the Privity, moſt of all in the fore part next the Bladder, leſs towards the Inteſtinum rectum on which it reſts; and they ſerve for the greater Titillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cauſed by the rubbing of the Nut of the Yard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſaid wrinkles. And in young Maids theſe wrinkles are ſtraiter, and the Neck narrower, through which the Menſtrual blood is voided; alſo in grown perſons that are yet Virgins. But the wrinkles are worn out, and the ſides become callous, by reaſon of frequent rubbing, 1. In old women. 2. In ſuch as have uſed much Copulation, or have frequently bore Children. 3. In thoſe that have been troubled with a long Flux of the Courſes, or of the Whites. And in all theſe the ſubſtance does alſo become harder, ſo that it becomes at laſt griſtley, as it were old women, and ſuch as have born many Children. But in young Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, it is more ſoft and delicate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Neck is to receive the Yard being raiſed, and to draw out the Seed.</p>
               <p>Finally, beyond the middle towards<note place="margin">The Orifice of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> the end of the Neck, in the fore and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part, not far from the Privity, comes the <hi>Inſertion of the Bladder</hi> into ſight, that the Urin may there be voided by the common Paſſage. It is as long as a knucle of ones finger, without fleſhy, or rather covered with a fleſhy Sphincter. <hi>Pinaeus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that it is black within, of the ſame ſubſtance with the Piſs-pipe in Men, as any man may ſee, now <hi>Riola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> that told us ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wierus</hi> hath noted in his Obſervations, that the ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter extremity of the Neck of the Bladder, does not in all women appear in the ſame place, in many tis ſeen above the outer ſtraits of the neck of the womb, under the Nymph; in ſome few it lies hid inwardly, in the upper part of the Privity. But the entrance into the Bladder, is ſound on the back-ſide, when the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane called <hi>Hymen</hi> is there: of which we are now to ſpeak.</p>

                  <hi>Virginity,</hi> ought not to be doubted. For all Men find that marry Virgins, that there is ſomwhat that hinders their Yard from going in, unleſs it be thruſt forward with great force and ſtrength. Whence <hi>Terence</hi> ſaies the firſt Copulation of a Virgin is exceeding painful. And at that time for the moſt part, blood iſſue with great pain, more or leſs; which Blood is alſo called <hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:41352:40"/>For by reaſon of the widening of the<note place="margin">Why Virgins are pained in their firſt carnal Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> ſtrait Neck of the Womb, and the tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Hymen, all Virgins have pain and a Flux of blood in their firſt Copulation. Younger Virgins have more pain and leſs Flux of blood, becauſe of the drineſs of the Hymen and the ſmallneſs of their Veſſels; but thoſe that are older, and have had their Courſes, have leſs pain and greater flux of blood, for the contrary cauſes.</p>
               <p>But if her Courſes flow, or have flowed a little before: the Yard is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily<note place="margin">An Exception.</note> admitted, by reaſon of the Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Parts, whence there is little or no pain, and little or no flux of blood. And therefore Maids ought not to be married at that ſeaſon, leaſt the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom come to ſuſpect the Virginity of his Bride.</p>
               <p>Now what it is that hinders the Yard from entring, that is to ſay, in<note place="margin">What is the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Virginity.</note> what part the token of Virginity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, there are ſundry Opinions and Differences.</p>
               <p>I.

               <p>Theſe are Fancies.</p>
               <p>II. Others (among whom are <hi>Fernelius</hi> and <hi>Ulmus</hi>) do ſay that the<note place="margin">The <hi>II.</hi> Opinion.</note> ſides of the Neck grow together, and when they are ſeparated and widened, the Veins are broken which run in thoſe Parts. But this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Experience, which witneſſes, that in little Girls the Neck hath its Cavity, nor do the ſides there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſtick together.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Others</hi> ſay it is a tranſverſe Membrane.<note place="margin">The <hi>III.</hi> Opinion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And herein they are right. But they are deceived, who have feigned it to have Holes in it like a Seive, and placed it in the loweſt end of the Neck: through which they would have the Urin to be voided.</p>
               <p>IV. The neweſt Opinion of all, is that of <hi>Severinus Pinaeus,</hi> a moſt<note place="margin">The <hi>IV.</hi> Opinion.</note> expert Surgeon of <hi>Paris,</hi> who hath wrote an whole Book of the Notes of Virginity, not unprofitable to be read. Now he accounts the four Myrtle-ſhap'd Caruncles to be the Hymen, tied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a ſmall Membrane, placed in the outer part of the neck of the womb; of which hereafter. And ſome learned men are at this day of his Opinion, as <hi>Bauhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> for one. I could find no other in a young Girl, lately diſſected in this place.</p>
               <p>V. The more common Opinion is, that the Hymen is a tranſverſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane<note place="margin">The <hi>V.</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by many Authors.</note> going athwart the neck of the womb, a little above the Neck of the Bladder, which reſiſts the firſt Entrance of the Yard. And many Experiments and Authorities ſtand up for this Opinion. And in the firſt place of four moſt renowned Anatomiſts, of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua, Veſalius, Fallopius, Aquapendent,</hi> and <hi>Caſſerius.</hi> And all Antiquity had ſome knowledg hereof.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> ſeem to have been ignorant hereof in the 1. Sect. of his 175. Exercitation, where he ſpeaks of a Root that extreamly excites Luſt. For he ſaies; <hi>If any ſhall piſs thereon, they ſay he will preſently be full of fleſhy deſires: Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that look to Cattle in the fields, if they ſit thereon or make water, tis ſaid the skin in their Privity will break, as if they had been defloured by a Man. Columbus</hi> and <hi>Sebizius</hi> did three times find it, <hi>Baubinus</hi> twice, as he averrs in his Book of the ſimilar Parts, and <hi>Wolfius</hi> ſeems in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions to aſſent thereunto, who witneſſes that he found it at <hi>Padua. Adrianus Spigelius</hi> affirms that he found it in all the Virgins that ever he did cut up, and I my ſelf and <hi>Veſlingus</hi> at the ſame time ſaw it at <hi>Padua.</hi> Nor is it neceſſary to bring all the Authorities which might be had in this ſubject to this place.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>Columbus</hi> and <hi>Paraeus</hi>

Or if they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected young Virgins, they through wantonneſs do ſomtimes with their fingers break the ſaid Skin or Membrane. But if they ſhall ſay they did cut up abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Births, Girls of two or three years old &amp;c. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer tis incredible that the Hymen ſhould be wanting in ſuch, ſeeing the Authorities and Experiences of skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Anatomiſts forecited, are againſt it. Again, if in ſome by them diſſected, it was wanting; by the ſame right that they ſay this Membrane is praeternaturally preſent, we ſhall ſay it was praeternaturally abſent. For it is ſeldom abſent, and for the moſt part preſent. And others that are for <hi>Laurentius</hi> againſt us, ſuch as <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaccius</hi> and <hi>Augenius,</hi> are to be rejected as perſons not skilled in Aſtronomie.</p>
               <p>VI. There is a midling Opinion<note place="margin">The <hi>VI.</hi> Opinion.</note> of <hi>Melchior Sebizius,</hi> viz. that all the ſigns of Virginity muſt be joyned together, when they are preſent. And when the Hymen or Skin ſo called is abſent, we muſt reſt in the ſtraitneſs of the Neck and other marks, which being widened in the firſt Copulation, pain and effuſion of blood follows by reaſon of the Solution of Continuity.</p>
               <p>Theſe things thus promiſed, let us come to the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of this Hymen or thin Skin which goes croſs the neck of the womb.</p>
               <p>Tis <hi>ſituate</hi> in the neck of the womb, near the end thereof, juſt behind the Inſertion of the Neck of the Bladder, or a little more inward. For the Situation does now and then vary, though the difference is but little. And there this Membrane goes croſs the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, like the Diaphragma or Midriff.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Figure.</hi> In the middle it hath an hole like a ring, ſo that in grown Maids, it will admit the top of ones little finger, through which hole the Courſes flow.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Aquapendent</hi> hath many times found this hole in a threefold difference.<note place="margin">The hole in the middle of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is of ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions.</note>
               </p>

               <p>II. Higher, and not juſt againſt the Privity.</p>

               <p>Its <hi>Subſtance</hi> is partly membranous, partly fleſhy, nor yet very thick. And in ſome it is thinner and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker then in others.

In ſome it is more ſoild and thick, and ſomtimes ſo ſtrong, that it muſt be cut open, eſpecially when the Bridegroom is lazie and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent: for if he be a luſty Carle, he is wont after ſome months labor, to make his way through.</p>
               <p>This Membrane is furniſhed with many <hi>little Veins,</hi> which being broken in the firſt Copulation, pain and blood-ſhed ariſes.

               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Hymen is, to defend the internal Parts from external Injury. 2. To teſtifie a Maids Virginity.</p>
               <p>Now a Maid may conceive without<note place="margin">Whether Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception may be made without hurting the Hymen.</note> hurting the token of her Virginity, which <hi>Americus Veſputius</hi> relates to have been common in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and <hi>Speronus</hi> and <hi>Peramatus</hi> prove the ſame. Tis reported that at <hi>Paris</hi> a certain wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in this preſent Age wherein we live, was got with Child, without any Detriment to her Virginal Parts, and a like Hiſtory is related by <hi>Clementina.</hi> Which we may conceive to be done five manner of waies, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned up by <hi>Plempius</hi> and <hi>Sinibaldus,</hi> which for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors ſake, I ſhall here omit. Nor does this any waies prejudice the Conception of our Savior, which was performed without any of theſe waies, without the Embracement of any Man, and only by the overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing of the Holy Spirit, of which it belongs to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines to treat. If we believe <hi>Suidas,</hi> the Membrance was by the Midwives found in the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> when it was queſtion'd, whether ſhe had loſt her Virginity or no; which I conceive to have been inconſiſtent with the Modeſty of that bleſſed Virgin. The living <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that he might be reputed for a God, boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted that he was born of his Mother <hi>Rachel,</hi> ſhe being a Virgin. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> conceits that in the State of Innocence, the Seed of the Man might be conveighed into the Womb of the Woman, her Virginity remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncorrupted, even as now Menſtrual blood comes out of the womb of a Virgin, without any Detriment to her Virginity. Which Opinion <hi>Vives</hi> does explain and approve.</p>
               <p>But that Women can become fruitful without the Seed of a Man, is incredible. For <hi>Caranza</hi> judges that Story of <hi>Pomponius Mela,</hi> of certain hairy women in an Iſland, which are fruitful without any Copulation of Men, to be a Fable.

                  </hi> the Ship; others commonly call it <hi>Natura muliebris,</hi> the Womans Nature. <hi>Varre</hi> tells us the Romans called it <hi>Porca</hi> the Furrow or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley-bed, the Sow. And what Experience of biting made, <hi>Suidas</hi> and <hi>Euſtathius</hi> call it <hi>cuneiron</hi> or <hi>cuona,</hi> the Dog, let thoſe judg that can ſpeak by Experience.</p>
               <p>It is only one in <hi>Number. Obſequens</hi> tells of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had two Privities, and <hi>Licetus</hi> hath obſerved many ſuch as Monſters.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Situation</hi> is external, in the former Region of the Share-bones, where very<note place="margin">Parts of the Privitie.</note> many parts are to be ſeen without Diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſome without drawing open the Lips; as the Hairs of the Share, the Lips, and the Hillocks themſelves; the great external Chink, the Wings, the Tentigo; but ſome parts cannot be ſeen without drawing the Lips aſide, as the <hi>foſſa navicularis,</hi> the two ſmaller Chinks by the Nymphs, the bodies of the Clitoris, the Hole of the Neck of the Bladder, with with a fleſhy Valve, the wrinkled Chink or immediate Mouth of the Neck, with four Caruncles, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Membranes: where afterwards the Channel begins of which we have ſpoken.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hairs</hi> of the Share in ſuch as are ripe, break out about the Lips, the better to cloſe the Chink. And they are in Women more curled then in Maids; of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry colors, being produced by Nature, partly the ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and partly to cover theſe parts, which ſhe judges ought in decency to be covered. But the Italian and Eaſtern Women out of a deſire of cleanlineſs and neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, do by Art remove theſe Hairs as unprofitable.</p>
               <p>The Lips being drawn open, there appears 1. MAGNA FOSSA the large<note place="margin">See Fig. II. <hi>and</hi> III. <hi>of the</hi> XXVIII. Tab.</note> Trench or Ditch, with the outer GREAT CHINK, and we may call the foreſaid Ditch <hi>Foſſa navicularis</hi> the Boat trench, becauſe of its likeneſs to a little Boat or Ship. For it is backwards more deep and broad, that the lower and after-end might degenerate as it were the Ditch or Trench. In this Ditch the Lips be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened, two Holes appear, but hardly viſible, ſave in live bodies, out of which a good quantity of whey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Humor Iſſues, which moiſtens the Mans Share in the time of Copulation. The Orifice or Beginning of the Neck of the Womb, is in the middle of this Ditch.</p>
               <p>Now this Ditch with the external Chink were to be large, that the Child might in the external part come out more eaſily, ſeeing the Skin cannot be ſo ſtretched, as the membranous Subſtance within may be.</p>
               <p>Then we meet with two COLLATERAL CHINKS, which are leſs: the right and the left, and they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lips and the Wings.</p>
               <p>Now in this large Ditch, there are firſt of all to be ſeen certain <hi>Caruncles</hi> or little Parcels of fleſh, of which we are now to diſcourſe.</p>

               <p>IN the Middle of the Ditch or<note place="margin">See. Fig. IV. <hi>of</hi> Tab. XXVIII.</note> Trench aforeſaid, appear four CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RUNCLES or little Particles of fleſh, preſently after the Wings.</p>
               <p>They are ſo <hi>ſituate</hi> that each poſſeſſes a corner, and oppoſe one another in manner of a quadrangle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One</hi> of them is before in the circumference of the hole of the urinary Paſſage, to ſhut the ſame (it being greater then the reſt, and forked) leaſt after the water is voided, any external thing as Air, &amp;c. ſhould enter into the Bladder.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecon</hi> oppoſite to the former, is ſituate behind, the <hi>two</hi> remaining ones are Collateral.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Shape</hi> reſembles the Berries of Myrtle.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Size</hi> varies, for ſome have their ſhorter, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thicker, and thinner then others. Howbeit they abide til extream old Age, and wear not away ſo much as in thoſe that have uſed frequent Copulation and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Child-bearing.</p>
               <p>They have ſome Membranes joyned to them, which <hi>Pinaeus</hi> together with the Caruncles terms Valves: ſo that their ſubſtance is partly fleſhy and partly membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hole</hi> in the middle between theſe Caruncles, is of various ſize, according to the age of the Party. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>Riolanus</hi> hath obſerved, that in Virgins it equals a third part of the great Chink.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>He</hi> conceives, theſe Caruncles are made by the wrinkling of the fleſhy ſheath of the Privity, that the external part being narrower then the ſheath, may in time of travel be widened as much as it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a Child-bed Woman, after ſhe was brought to bed, he obſerved them for ſeven daies quite oblitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by reaſon of the great diſtention of the Privity, nor is there any appearance of them till the Privity be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſtraitned and reduced to its Natural form.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Uſe</hi> is, I. to defend the internal parts, while they immediately ſhut the Orifice of the Neck, that no Air, Duſt, &amp;c. may enter. To which end alſo the Nymphs and Lips of the Privity do ſerve.</p>
               <p>II. Fortitillation and pleaſure, while they are ſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and ſtrongly ſtrain, and milk the Yard as it were, eſpecially in young Laſſes.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Pinaeus</hi> will have their uſe to be far different. For he ſaies theſe Caruncles, whoſe Extremities are fleſhy Membranes, are ſo bound together, as to leave only a little hole, and ſo to make the Hymen or true Mark of Virginity. Nor will he have it ſeated acroſs or ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart, but long-waies, ſo that the figure of the whole Hymen ſhould make an obtuſe cone, or a cone with the ſharp end cut off.</p>

               <p>Now the CLITORIS is a ſmall Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.<note place="margin">See Tab. XXVIII.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is <hi>ſeated</hi> in the middle of the Share, in the upper and former end of the great Chink, where</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:41352:42"/>Its <hi>Size</hi> is commonly ſmall; it lies hid for the moſt part under the Nymphs in its beginning, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it ſticks out a little. For in Laſſes that begin to be amorous, the Clitoris does firſt diſcover it ſelf. It is in ſeveral perſons greater or leſſer: in ſome it hangs out like a mans Yard, namely when young Wenches do frequently and continually handle and rub the ſame, as Examples reſtifie. But that it ſhould grow as big as a Gooſes neck, as <hi>Platerus</hi> relates of one, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether praeternatural and monſtrous. <hi>Tulpius</hi> hath a like Story of one that had it as long as half a mans fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and as thick as a Boys Prick, which made her wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have to do with Women in a Carnal way. But the more this part encreaſes, the more does it hinder a man in his buſineſs. For in the time of Copulation it ſwells like a mans Yard, and being erected, provokes to Luſt.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Subſtance</hi> is not boney (though it was ſo in a Venetian Courtezan, who<note place="margin">Its Subſtance.</note> had it cut off, and the hardneſs whereof did inflame the Yards of the Lovers) but as that of a mans Yard, it conſiſts of two nervous Bodies hard and thick, within porous and ſpungy (that this part might riſe and fall) ariſing diſtinctly from the Hip-bones, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the brims of the ſaid Bones. But they are joyned together about the Share-bone, and make up the Body of the Yard. Its <hi>Muſcles</hi> are, according to <hi>Pinaeus</hi> three, according to <hi>Riolanus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Its Muſcles.</note> and <hi>Veſlingus</hi> four, like as in a mans Yard, and ſerving to the ſame Intent. The two uppermoſt round ones, reſt upon longer Ligaments, and proceed from one and the ſame place; the two others being lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, broad, and fleſhy, proceed from the Sphincter of the Fundament.</p>
               <p>The outmoſt End or Head, ſticking out like the nut of a mans Yard (the reſt lying hid) is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led TENTIGO, having an hole as a mans<note place="margin">Tentigo.</note> Yard, but no thoroughfar.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to be covered with a Fore-skin as it were, which is made of a ſmall Skin ariſing from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Wings.</p>
               <p>Alſo it hath <hi>Veſſels</hi> of all ſorts brought unto it.<note place="margin">Its Veſſels.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Veins and Arteries</hi> common to it and the Privity, a <hi>Nerve</hi> from the ſixt Conjugation, all more large then the Nature of its Body might ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, to cauſe an exact Feeling and Erection.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to be the Seat of Delectation and Love. And it is like the <hi>Froenulum</hi> or Bridle<note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note> on the Nut of a mans Yard. For by the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing thereof, the Seed is brought away.</p>
               <p>Howbeit <hi>Aquapendent</hi> conceives that the Uſe of the Clitoris, is to ſuſtain the Neck of the Womb in the time of Copulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellonius</hi> and <hi>Iovius</hi> do conceive that this is the part wherein the Aethiopians were wont to circumciſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <hi>Aetius</hi> and <hi>Aegineta</hi> do ſhew us how to cut it off, confounding it with the Nymph. And even at this day, the Eaſtern Nations, in regard of its bignes extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, do ſear it, that it may grow no more. And they hire ancient women to perform this Piece of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, which they improperly term Circumciſion. And it is to thoſe people as neceſſary, in regard of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed greatneſs of the Clitoris, as it is comely; for at <hi>Alcair</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> Wenches go naked after this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and when they are married, they wear a Smock only. Of which things is alſo this kind of Circumciſion, I have diſcourſed at large in my <hi>Puerpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Antiquities.</hi>

               <p>TWo red Productions offer themſelves to our view between the Lips, which they term <hi>pterugia</hi> and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAS, that is the <hi>Wings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> calls them NYMPHS, either<note place="margin">See FIG. III. <hi>and</hi> IV. <hi>of the</hi> Tab. XXVIII.</note> becauſe they do firſt admit the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, or becauſe they have charge of the Waters and Humors iſſuing forth. For between them as it were two walls, the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin is caſt out to a good diſtance with an hiſſing noiſe, without wetting the Lips of the Privity. Others call them the Curicular Caruncles.</p>
               <p>They are <hi>ſeated</hi> between the two Lips.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Magnitude</hi> is not alwaies alike: for ſomtimes one Wing, otherwhiles both, ſeldomer in Virgins then in women, do grow ſo big, eſpecially being frequently drawn by the fingers, or otherwiſe by an Afflux of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by reaſon of the impediments thereby hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, tis neceſſary to cut them. And <hi>Galen</hi> tells us that this Diſeaſe is frequent among the Aegyptians; ſo that they are faln to cut them in Virgins that are to marry, and in other women alſo; and <hi>Aeetius</hi> and <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineta</hi> do ſpeak to the ſame purpoſe, which others will have to be underſtood of the Clitoris. And they are in the right as I conceive, becauſe the Clitoris being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver long, may hinder the amorous Embracement, and may be raiſed like the Yard; but the Nymphs cannot be this way troubleſom, which are ſofter, and in ſome do hang down very long, yea in Whores that trade with theſe Parts.</p>
               <p>They are in <hi>Number</hi> two; the right and the left, now they are in the beginning commonly joyned together, where they make a fleſhy Production, like a Fore-skin cloathing the Clitoris.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Figure</hi> is triangular, but one angle is blunter then the reſt, viz. that which comes without the Lips. It is like a Cocks-comb: and for that cauſe haply by <hi>Juvenal</hi> termed <hi>Criſta.</hi>
               </p>

                  </hi> is red like a Cocks-comb under his throat.</p>
               <p>Tis covered with a thin <hi>Coat</hi> rather then Skin, as the Lips and other parts of the Mouth.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Subſtance</hi> is partly membranous, ſoft, and ſpungy (bred peradventure of the doubling in of the Skin, at the ſides of the great Chink) and partly fleſhy.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Uſe</hi> is the ſame with that of the Myrtle-ſhap'd Caruncles. And moreover that the Urin might be conveighed between them, as between two wals. Some conceive they ſerve as a Ligament, to ſuſpend and ſtraiten as it were, in Virgins, the lower part of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Chink, which ſeems unlikely. The Lips per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that Office, and the Nymphs ſhould rather ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuch as are defloured, in whom they are longer.</p>
               <p>The two LIPS, between which the external Chink conſiſts, have certain<note place="margin">The Lips and <hi>Venus</hi> Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks.</note> riſings adorned with hair, which are termed <hi>Monticuli Veneris,</hi> the Hillocks of <hi>Venus.</hi> In women they are flatter then in maidens. This Part is that which is properly termed the Privity. Theſe Hillocks are longiſh, ſoft Bodies, of ſuch a Subſtance, the like whereof is not to be found in the whole Body again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it conſiſts part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Skin, and partly of ſpungy Fleſh, under which is placed a parcel of hard Fat.</p>

               <p>The <hi>firſt Membrane</hi> is termed AMNIOS becauſe of of its ſoftneſs and thinneſs, alſo <hi>Agnina, Charta Virginea, Induſium, &amp;c.</hi> And it is the thinneſt of them all, white, ſoft, tranſparent, furniſhed with a few very ſmal Veins and Arteries, diſperſed within the foldings thereof. It compaſſes the Child immediately and cleaves every where almoſt to the Chorion, eſpecially at the ends, about the Womb-Cake, united in the middle thereof, where the Umbilical Veſſels come forth. Yet we can eaſily ſeparate it from the Chorion. There is in it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41352:44"/>
plenty of Moiſture and Humors wherein the child ſwims which proceeds in Brutes from Sweat, in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from Sweat and Urin. But <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> having obſerved that in Brutes<note place="margin">Whence the Liquor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that is in the Amni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os.</note> the Sweat and Urin were contained in ſeveral little Membranes, the latter more low and externally in the Chorion, the former higher, and more inwardly in the Amnion; he thought it was ſo in Mankind much more. But Experience and Reaſon are againſt it, becauſe there are no Paſſages to the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion. And becauſe we do not find the Urachus open in Mankind, therefore the Urin cannot be thence col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the Amnios, but is voided by the Yard if it be troubleſom, and the remainder is kept till the time of the Birth, in the Bladder, which in Children new born is for the moſt part diſtended and full, but in Brutes empty. Nor does the ſharpneſs of the Urin offend the Child in the Womb, becauſe 1. It is but little in a Child in the Womb, becauſe of the benignity and purity of its Nouriſhment. 2. The Skin is daubed with a clammy Humor, and Brutes are defended by their hairineſs. Therefore the <hi>Uſe</hi> is</p>
               <p>I. That the Child floating therein as in a Bath, may be higher and leſs burthenſom to the Mother.</p>
               <p>II. That the Child may not ſtrike againſt any neighboring hard Parts.</p>
               <p>III. That in the Birth, the Membrane being broke, this Humor running out, may make the way through the Neck of the Womb, ſmooth, eaſie, and ſlippery.</p>
               <p>Part of the Amnios does ever and anon hang about the Head of the Child when it comes forth, and then the Child is ſaid to be <hi>Galeatus</hi> or Helmeted. This Helmet the Midwives diligently obſerve for divers reſpects, and they prognoſticate good fortune to the Child, and others that uſe it, if it be red; but if it be black, the praeſage bad fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paraeus, Lemnius</hi> and others, conceive that the happy and ſtrong Labor of the Mother, is the cauſe that the foreſaid Helmet comes out with the child, but in a troubleſom Labor it is left behind. <hi>Spigelius</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwife, thinks that when the Mother and child are weak, it comes away. <hi>Beſterus</hi> makes the Reaſon to be the roughneſs of the Amnios, which the child is not able to break through, or the weakneſs of the child, for which cauſe it ſeldom lives to ripeneſs of Age. I have ſeen both thoſe that have come into the world with this Helmet, and thoſe without it, miſerable; and by chance it comes to cleave both to the Heads of ſtrong and weak children.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Membrane is termed Chorion, becauſe it compaſſes the child like a Circle.</p>
               <p>This immediately compaſſes the former, and lies beneath it in a round ſhape like a Pancake, whoſe inner or hollow part it covers and invelops, ſpreading it ſelf out according to the meaſure thereof. It is hardly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated therefrom, and it ſtrongly unites the Veſſels to the Womb-liver, and bears them up. Towards the child it is more ſmooth and ſlippery, but where it is ſpread under the Womb-cake, and faſtned thereto, it is more rough: alſo it is ſufficiently thick and double. In Brutes the <hi>Cotyledons</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyledons are.</note> cleave hereunto, which conſiſt of a fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhy and ſpungy ſubſtance. But in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, this Membrane cleavs immediately to the womb, by a certain round and reddiſh lump of fleſh, faſtned to one part only of the womb (commonly the upper and former part) nor does it compaſs the whole child; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing framed of an innumerable company of Branches, of Veins, and Arteries, among which bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>That ſame round Maſs is called PLACENTA UTERI the Womb-pancake, by reaſon of its Shape; alſo the WOMB LIVER: which I will now exactly deſcribe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it hath been my hap to ſee it.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is circular, but the Circumference une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, in which I have obſerved five Prominences ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in due order, and the Membrane Chorion in the intermediate ſpaces, thicker then ordinary. Where it looks towards the Womb, it is rough and waved, like baked bread that hath chinks in it; and being cut in this part, it diſcovers an infinite number of fibres, which if you follow, they will bring you to the Trunks of the Veins.</p>
               <p>It is one in <hi>Number,</hi> even in thoſe who bear two or more children at a burthen. For into one Womb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cake, ſo many Cords are inſerted in divers places, as there are children.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Magnitude</hi> varies according to the condition of the Bodies and the children<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Yet it is about a foot in the Diameter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Subſtance</hi> thereof ſeems to be a Body wove to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of infinite little fibres, blood as it were congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led being interpoſed, which is eaſily ſeparated. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore it hath a Parenchyma, it is no wonder, if like a kind of, Liver it make or prepare blood to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the child.</p>
               <p>The Nature and Appearance of the Subſtance, is not every where alike. For here and there it is <hi>glandulous,</hi> eſpecially in the tops of the Hillocks, as being the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctories of the childs Work-houſe, placed in the outmoſt Verges. It is <hi>thicker</hi> in the middle of the hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks; and thin about the brims, variouſly interwoven with the Capillary Veins: For,</p>
               <p>It hath <hi>Veſſels,</hi> viz. <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> running through the ſame, from the Umbelical Veſſels, which by little and little are all extenuated about the brims of the Womb-cake, making wonderful contextures, cloſely ſticking to the Subſtance thereof, ſo that no part of the Branches is void. They are joyned together by vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Anaſtomoſes, which ſhall be hereafter deſcribed, through which the blood in the child runs back, out of the Arteries into the Veins. For I have obſerved in the Veins of the Womb-cake, how that the blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, may eaſily by ones finger or an inſtrument, be forced towards the Trunk or Cord, but not towards the Womb-cake. The contrary where to happens in the Arteries, which by impulſe of the finger, do eaſily ſend the blood to the Womb-liver, but hardly to the Trunk.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is 1. To ſupport the Navil-veſſels, under which it is ſpred as a Pillow.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe it hath a ſingular kind of Parenchyma, to prepare blood to nouriſh the Child, as the true Liver does in grown perſons. For it mediately ſucks the Mothers blood through its Veins, out of the Veins of the womb, and prepares and tempers it for uſe, and ſoon after ſends it through the greater Navil-vein, into the Liver of the child, that it may be carried right forth unto the Heart, by the Anaſtomoſis and little Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; out of which by the Arteries it is diſtributed into the whole body of the child to nouriſh the ſame. But part of the blood returns through the Iliack Arteries, to the Womb-cake, as an appurtenance to the child; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preſerve the ſame by its heat, and to nouriſmit with Arterial blood, partly that it may be there further perfected; which Labor being finiſhed, it returns back again into the concomitant Veins, that together with other blood, newly ſupplied by the Pipes of the womb, it may paſs back again by the Umbelical Veins, and repeat the foreſaid Circle. <figure>

               <p>Now there are four Navil-veſſels: ONE VEIN, TWO ARTERIES, and the URACHUS. Which are covered and veiled as it were with a certain common</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coat</hi> or Cruſt, which ſome call <hi>Inteſtinulus, Funicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Laqueus,</hi> &amp;c. which does not only wrap up all the Veſſels, but alſo diſtinguiſhes them one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And the Uſe of this Coat, is to keep the Veſſels from being intangled one within another, broken, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way hurt.</p>
               <p>The VENA UMBILICALIS, much<note place="margin">The Vena um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilicalis.</note> greater then the Artery, being carried through the two Coats of the Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum, is bred in the firſt place before all other Veins, in reſpect of Perfection, becauſe it ought to afford nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to the reſt.</p>

to the Womb-cake. And it is variouſly coiled or rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about, that its length-might prove no hinderance. From the Navil it goes over the Breaſt, and from thence it is obliquely carried over the right and left ſide of the Throat and Neck, turning it ſelf back at the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-part of the Head, and ſo over the middle of the Fore-head unto the Womb-cake; ſomtimes alſo by this ſimple flexure on the left hand, it compaſſes the Neck like a chain. All which is to be underſtood of the whole Cord, and the reſt of the Veſſels contained therein. And this Journey being finiſhed, it ſpreads infinite Branches through the Secondine, till it looſe it ſelf into exceeding delicate fine hairy thrids.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to draw Blood to nouriſh the Child, and to carry it into its Liver, Now<note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note> the way is doubtful. Moſt men perſwade themſelves, that the Veins and Arteries of the Womb, are joyned with the little Veins and Arteries of the Womb-cake, and that from them joyntly blood is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived into the Navil-veſſels to the Child. But the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> are to be excluded from this Office, becauſe they are not joyned to the womb, nor ought they to carry any thing to the child, but to carry back from the child to the womb-cake. The <hi>Veins</hi> do only bring thither, and that by a twofold way, either immediately from the womb, or mediately. Immediately, when they are joyned to the Veſſels of the womb; mediately, when by the interceeding or going between of any fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhy Subſtance whatſoever, both in Mankind and Beaſts (which is alwaies for the moſt part glewed to the womb, and violently broke off in the Birth) it is ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through Pipes, firſt out of the womb into the outer parts of the womb-cake, and thence into the Capillary Veins thereof, out of the leaſt into the greater, till at laſt it is carried to the Umbilical Trunk, and to the Liver. Nor does it ſlip through the Veins of the womb into the Pipes, becauſe the Blood of the Veins does not nouriſh, but it is brought in by the Arteries in a woman with child, and goes up back again by the Veins, in a woman not with child.</p>
               <p>This Vein ſeems full of certain <hi>Knots:</hi> which are nothing but a more thick and<note place="margin">The Knots.</note> fleſhy Conſtitution of the <hi>Membrana car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſa</hi> in thoſe Parts; and a wider opening, wherewith as a ſpoon, the Blood is drawn in, in its long Journey, and is by little and little ſtopped, leaſt it flow too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently; that the Blood may be there the longer labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as we ſee in the Spermatick Veſſels: and that the Veſſels may be ſtronger.</p>
               <p>By the Number of theſe Knots, the Midwives do gueſs the number of Children that a woman ſhal bear: and if the Knot which firſt follows, be white and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, they foretel that the next child will be a Girl, if red, round, and ſwelling, that it will be a Boy. The firſt Divination is vain; for there are as many Knots in the Navil of the laſt child, as of the firſt. But the latter may be excuſed by the defect or abundance of Natural heat, whence the Diverſity of Sexes ariſes. From the diſtance of the Knots one from another, they foretel that the Conceptions will be ſooner or longer one after another, and that there will be Twins, if one Knot reſt upon, or be near to another. Which we have often found to be falſe, though chance, do now and then confirm the hope of credulous women.</p>
               <p>Two ARTERIES are inſerted into the Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack Arteries, and are carried with the Vein<note place="margin">Arteries.</note> after the foreſaid manner to the womb-cake, where it is ſpred about in divers Branches, whoſe <hi>Uſe</hi> is not, as hath hitherto been believed, to bring to the child vital Spirit with Arterial blood, becauſe theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries are not joyned to the Arteries of the Womb, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the moſt certain Obſervation of <hi>Arantius;</hi> but to carry back part of the Arterial blood, which is ſuperfluous to the Nouriſhment of the Child, by the two Iliack Branches into the Placenta or Womb-cake, partly to nouriſh the ſame, and fill it with vital Spirit. Partly that the Blood may there be made more perfect, being weakned by a long Journey, and nouriſhing the Membranes; which afterwards runs back again to the Child, by the hairy twigs of the veins joyned thereto, with that new blood coming out of the womb.</p>
               <p>This Motion is confirmed by Experience. I have often preſſed the ſwelling veins with my finger, and have obſerved that the blood is eaſily forced out of the vein towards the Child, not to the Womb-cake, where the knots like valves do ſtop the ſame; contrariwiſe, it is eaſily forced out of the Arteries into the Womb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cake. The ſame is manifeſt by Ligatures. For the Umbilical Arteries of a live Child being bound, as yet cleaving to the Mother being alive, <hi>Walaeus</hi> hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and others after him, that they pulſe between the Ligature and the Child, but have no Pulſe between the Ligature and the Mothers womb.</p>
               <p>For this Motions ſake the venal and<note place="margin">Anaſtomoſes of the umbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Veſſels.</note> Arterial branches are joyned together by <hi>Anaſtomoſes,</hi> within the Womb-cake, that the Paſſage might be ready for the blood to run back out of the little Arteries, into the little Veins.</p>
               <p>I have here, following my own ſight, obſerved ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral waies of Anaſtomoſes. For ſomtimes the twigs of the Veins and Arteries, do go one over another croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, both internally and externally. Somtimes they are joyned by Inſertion, ſomtimes they couple ſide to ſide, and ſomtimes they are wreathed. The ſmalleſt Twigs of the Branches are inoculated into the greater, united in like manner, but with more blunt Anaſtomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, till the Arteries are reduced to four Branches, the Vein to two, which at laſt grow into the trunks of their own kind, ſpringing out of the Womb-cake. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries go about the veins, and do partly accompany them, and partly creep alone by themſelves. I ſuſpect that there are Anaſtomoſes only in thoſe places, wherein they are neceſſary for the paſſing Blood out of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries into the veins, and that the ſolitary veins do ſuck freſh Blood out of the Womb.</p>

Which is ſo contrived 1. Leaſt by the winding paſſage of the Navil-veſſels, the motion of the Blood ſhould be hindred, ſeeing every veſſel that is twiſted, keeps it courſe. 2. That the Child in the womb might receive its pittance of Nouriſhment by little and little, without danger of choaking. 3. That by this wreathed and crooked Journey, the future A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Moreover, it is to be <hi>noted</hi> in the twiſting of the cord 1. That knots and ſpots are tranſparent in the vein and not in the Arteries, by reaſon of the Blood appearing through a thinner Coat. 2. That a ſpans diſtance from the Conjunction there appears, a wonderful contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a rougher and more confuſed twiſting then in other Parts. 3. In the outer Coat of the Inteſtinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, infinite cuts and lines are ſeen imprinted as it

If this cord be ſomtime ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther overtwiſted, or by motion wrapped about the Neck of the child, there is danger that the child will be ſtrangled, and the Mother have an hard labor, becauſe the child is drawn back by reaſon of the ſhortneſs of the cord, nor can it bear the violence of an indiſcreet Midwife. I have ſeen it twiſted divers times about the Neck of a child, whereby the birth was retarded for divers hours, and when the child came forth it could hardly breath: if in ſuch a caſe the childs Face be red tis a good ſign, but a deadly token if the Face be black and blew.</p>

Now the times of its falling of are uncertain, in reſpect of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the child, and the plenty of Blood which flows thereto, from whence the Midwives Prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate how long the child ſhall live. If it fall of the fift day from the hour it was tied, they foretell the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will be long-lived; if on the third day, they ſay they ſhall be ſhort-lived.</p>
               <p>The Navil being thus ſhaped and confirmed, is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a ſtrong Skin, which may be preternatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſtretched to an immenſe degree, to receive the Guts in a Rupture of the Navil, ſuch as <hi>Severinus</hi> hath deſcribed in a Picture, and as my ſelf have ſeen at <hi>Haf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> in an ancient Woman.</p>
               <p>In ſome there is a paſſage through the Navil into the Belly. <hi>Alpinus</hi> reports that the Aegyptians cure a bloody Flux, by thruſting their Fingers into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients Navil, and turning it divers times about. Dung came out of the Navil of a Student, and Worms like Earth-worms with quittor came out of the Navil of a Boy, according to the Obſervation of <hi>Salmuth. Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> ſaw quittor which Nature ſent from the Cheſt, come out at the Navil, and <hi>Folius</hi> found Stones bred here. I. D. <hi>Horſtius</hi> obſerved blood flow from the Navil in a certain Gentleman, monthly. And he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41352:46"/>
tels us of a Boy who had a wheyiſh liquor like Urin dropping from his Navil, and ſomtimes freſh blood. For the inner Veſſels are many times opened, by the Acrimony of the blood and wheyiſh humors. Alſo the Navil doth inſenſibly open it ſelf when purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Medicines for the Mother and to kill the Worms, &amp;c. are applied thereto.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Veſſels, after the Child is born, do within the Belly degenerate into Ligaments: the Vein to a Ligament of the Liver, the Arteries into lateral Ligaments of the Bladder. Becauſe their uſe is now loſt, and there is no longer any paſſage of the Mothers blood, unleſs they be ſomtimes preternaturally ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as in the examples alleadged. Yet are they not of ſo great moment, that<note place="margin">The Dignity of the Navil is not much.</note> their breaking or cutting off, ſhould cauſe death, as ſome and among them <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> imagine, being queſtionles abuſed by ſome Fabulous ſtory. For they report that the Aegyptians puniſh Robbers by flaying them alive, and that they leave the Navil untoucht, that they may be tormented the longer: for they think when the Navil is cut off a man muſt needs die, the four Veſſels being deſtroyed. But <hi>Riolanus</hi> a man of great experience ſaw contrary examples, and any man may judg by a Rupture of the Navil. If death follow, it is by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the inner parts being alſo hurt, and a wide dore opened for all hurtful things to enter. <hi>Sperlinger</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that they are choaked, becauſe the Navil being cut off, the Liver falls down and draws the Midriff, the Organ of breathing. But 1. This ſhortneſs of breath doth not cauſe ſudden death. 2. The Liver is held up by another ſtrong Ligament from the <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> Veſſel, the <hi>Urachus</hi> or Piſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, which is half as little again as the<note place="margin">Urachus.</note> Artery, conſiſts of two parts, according to the Obſervation of <hi>Riolanus;</hi> the inner, which is Nervous, ariſing from the inner coat of the Bladder the outer which is more Membranous, from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the bladder. It is not after the ſame manner in Beaſts as in Mankind.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Beaſts</hi> tis carryed without the Navil between two Arteries, and is at laſt ſpred out and widened into the Coat which is termed <hi>Allantoides,</hi> where Urin is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and reſerved, till the young one is brought forth. And therefore this Veſſel is termed <hi>Urachus,</hi> that is to ſay the Piſs-pipe.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Mankind,</hi> 1. It doth not go without the Navil, and therefore it doth not make the Coat <hi>Allantoides,</hi> for which cauſe the Child hath only two Coats.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Urachus</hi> is not hollow throughout according to the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note place="margin">The Urachus is not hollow in Mankind.</note> of <hi>Carpus, Arantius, Corteſius, Riolanus</hi> and others, whom I have found to be in the right, in ſuch Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as I have diſſected both old and young, though <hi>Aquapendens</hi> and <hi>Spigelius</hi> would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perſwade us other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But it is a little Cord or Ligament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the bladder is faſtned to the Peritonaeum and ſuſtained, leaſt when it is diſtended with Urin, its Neck ſhould be ſqueezed: Though I deny not but that the ſame thing is done by the Arteries.</p>
               <p>But a Child in the Womb voids Urin by its Yard into the Membarne <hi>Amnios</hi> (which makes it ſo ful of Liquor) and a great part is retained alſo in the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is the cauſe that new born Children, for the firſt daies are in a manner continually piſſing. <hi>Aqua-pendens</hi> denies this becauſe, 1. The motive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth not exerciſe it ſelf in a Child in the Womb. 2. No Muſcle Acts. 3. Neither doth Nature uſe ſo different a manner of voiding Urin in Men and Beaſts. But I anſwer, 1. That the various moving of a Child in the Womb, which Big-bellied Women feel, doth witneſs that the Child hath a moving fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty though imperfect. 2. The bladder is provoked to excretion, by the over great quantity and ſharpneſs of the Serum, or wheyiſh humor. 3. The Coat cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Allantoides</hi> which is not in Man-kind, doth ſhew the difference between Man and beaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uarolus</hi> will have all the Urin to be contained in the bladder, till the birth time. But then it would be broken with over ſtretching; and whence comes all the liquor which is in the Coat <hi>Amnios.</hi>

                  <hi>Aqua-pendens, Spigelius</hi> and almoſt all others will have it go out by the <hi>Urachus,</hi> and be collected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Amnios</hi> and <hi>Allantoides,</hi> as in beaſts. But ſeeing it is not perforated, but ſolid in Man-kind, it cannot admit the Urin. For it cannot be ſtrained through, without a manifeſt paſſage, becauſe it is thick, and the ſame way might hold in grown Perſons. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlingius</hi> propounds both theſe opinions and determins nothing. Now it is no more Porous in a young child then a grown perſon. And <hi>Laurentius</hi> eagerly defends this opinion out of <hi>Galen,</hi> bringing the examples of ſome, who when their Urin was ſtopt, did void it at their Navil.</p>
               <p>But I anſwer: This is done praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally,<note place="margin">The Error of Laurentius.</note> as it is alſo a known opinion of many, that the Umbilical Vein hath been preternaturally opened in Hydropical perſons, and voided the Water. And <hi>Laurentius</hi> himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, that all the four Umbilical Veſſels do turn to Ligaments; wherein he is right, for they are dried. How therefore can they be opened unleſs preternatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally? So it was I conceive preternaturally opened in the ſame Italian called <hi>Anna,</hi> who hath no Yard, in ſtead whereof a ſpungy bit of fleſh hung out under his Navil, whence the Urin dropt. <hi>Fernelius</hi> and others have other examples of the <hi>Urachus</hi> opened.</p>
               <p>Before the Production of all the Umbilical Veſſels in the Womb, the ſeed being curdled in the top of the hinder part, two certain Roots are inſerted, on each ſide one from the horns of the Womb, firſt obſerved by <hi>Varolius</hi> and called <hi>Radices Dorſales,</hi> the back Roots which are obliterated, when the rudiments of the Child are framed, touching which <hi>Riolanus</hi> explains <hi>Aben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina.</hi>

            <p>THe <hi>middle Venter</hi> or Belly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Thorax</hi> the Cheſt, and by<note place="margin">The middle Venter what it is.</note> ſome abſolutely <hi>Venter,</hi> is all that which is circumſcribed above, by Clavicles or Channel-bones; beneath the Midriff; on the foreſide by the Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone; on the hinder part by the Bones of the Back, and on the ſides by the Ribs.</p>
            <p>The fore-part is called <hi>Sternon</hi> and <hi>Pectus,</hi> &amp;c. the Hinder-part, the Back; the Lateral Parts are termed the Sides.</p>
            <p>Howbeit the Ancients as <hi>Hypocrates</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> &amp;c. did comprehend all<note place="margin">Hypocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes <hi>and</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle.</note> from the Channel-bones as far as to the Privities, that is to ſay, the middle and lower Belly under the Name of Cheſt. And therefore in this Senſe <hi>Hypocrates</hi> did well write, that the Liver is ſeated in the Cheſt: which other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful perſons not underſtanding, did imagine that <hi>Hypocrates</hi> was ill verſed in Anatomy.</p>
            <p>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is after a ſort Oval, though not exactly, and <hi>Hypocrates</hi> compares it<note place="margin">Its Figure.</note> to a Tortoiſe or the Belly of a Lute. In Mankind, it is more bunching in the fore-part, but in the middle of the Breſt-bone it is flatter, about the ſides round, becauſe of the bowing of the Ribs, in the Back more flat.</p>
            <p>Its <hi>Magnitude</hi> in General, varies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different degree of Heat:<note place="margin">Magnitude.</note> for by the wideneſs of the Cheſt we mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Heat of the Heart. But in particular perſons it is larger towards the lower Belly, where the vital bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels are concealed, and grows narrower by little and little at the beginning of the Neck.</p>
            <p>Its outer <hi>Subſtance</hi> is partly bony, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fleſhy.<note place="margin">Subſtance.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This middle Belly is not wholly fleſhy as the lower is, 1. Becauſe it was not to contain any Parts, that were very much to be ſtretched. 2. That over-much Fat might be bred there, and hinder Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
            <p>Yet is it partly fleſhy, becauſe it contains Parts which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ought to be moved, as the Heart and Lungs, and for the ſame Cauſe,</p>
            <p>It could not be altogether bony, like the Skull; for that is a very rare caſe which <hi>Cardan</hi> mentions in his 11. Book of Subtilties, Page 458. in my Edition, of a Man that inſtead of Ribs, had one continued Bone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rom the Throat to the Flanks.</p>
            <p>Yet is it in part bony, for to ſafeguard the noble Parts. For,</p>
            <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to contain the vital Parts as the<note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note> lower and firſt Belly contains the Natural.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Common</hi> are the ſame which are in<note place="margin">Common.</note> the lower Belly. Howbeit theſe things following are here to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Skin</hi> of the middle Belly is hairy<note place="margin">The Uſe of the hair un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits.</note> under the Arm-pits. Theſe <hi>Hairs</hi> are called <hi>Subalares Pili,</hi> being uſeful to keep thoſe Parts from wearing and fretting, in the Motion of the Arms, ſeeing they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly and quickly ſweat, becauſe they are termed the Emunctories of the Heart, receiving the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof (in ſome alſo that are hotter of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtrong-hearted the breaſt is hairy) as the Groins are called the Emunctories of the Liver.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there is little <hi>Fat</hi> found in the Cheſt, if you except the Dugs, that<note place="margin">Why there is little Fat in the Cheſt.</note> Reſpiration may not be hurt by the weight thereof. For by reaſon of its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part, ſo great plenty of the matter of Fat could not flow into it, as in the lower Belly, which is wholly fleſhy, and therefore alwayes the fatteſt part of the body; the middle belly or Cavity is indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtored with Fat; the Head is leaſt fat of all.

                  <hi>Chap. I.</hi> Of the Dugs.</head>
               <p>ACcording to our Anatomical Method,<note place="margin">See Tab. XXV. Lib. I.</note> the firſt Parts in the Cheſt which we diſſect, as ſoon as we have done with the lower Belly, are the Dugs. Now we ſhall treat of the Dugs of Women, caſting in between while, wherein thoſe of Men differ therefrom.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scituation</hi> of the Dugs, is in the middle of the Breſt, above the Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral<note place="margin">Why the Dugs in Mankind are ſeated in the Breaſt.</note> Muſcle, which draws to the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. 1. Becauſe of the nearneſs of the Heart, from whence they receive heat. 2. For Comelineſs ſake. 3. For the more convenient giving of ſuck: becauſe the Infant cannot preſently walk after the manner of Brutes, but being embraced in his Mothers Arms, it is applied to the Dugs. No other Creatures have Dugs in their Breaſts ſaving the Apes, who hold their young ones in their Arms likewiſe. <hi>Laurentius</hi> tells us the Elephant does the like, and <hi>Riolanus</hi> ſayes as much of the Bat or Flitter-mouſe. Some great Sea-fiſhes of the Whale-kind have Dugs on their Breſts, full of Milk, as we lately obſerved in a Whale that came out of <hi>Norwey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are two in <hi>Number:</hi> not becauſe of Twins; but that one being hurt, the<note place="margin">Number of the Dugs</note> other might ſupply its Office. Howbeit <hi>Varro</hi> reports, that Sows will have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pigs as they have teats. <hi>Walaeus</hi> in a certain wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man obſerved three Dugs, two on the left ſide of her Breſt, and one on the right. And <hi>Cabrolius</hi> obſerved in a certain woman four Dugs, on each ſide two.</p>
               <p>As to their <hi>Magnitude.</hi> In Girls new born, there is only a Print or Mark viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">Magnitude.</note> on the breſt, and afterwards by little and little it ſwells, and in little wenches hardly any thing appears beſide the teats, untill by degrees they grow to the bigneſs and ſhape of Apples; and when they are raiſed two fingers high, their Courſes begin to flow. In old women they wither away, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appears but the Nipples, the Fat and Kernels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſumed.</p>
               <p>In women they ſwel more, and in women with child the laſt moneths, they are more and more encreaſed.</p>
               <p>In men they do not riſe ſo high as in women, becauſe ordinarily they were<note place="margin">The difference of the Dugs in men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> not to breed milk [yet becauſe of the equality of the kind, it was convenient that men ſhould have them as well as women.] And therefore in men, the Dugs are commonly without Kernels: yet in burly people, the Fat which is under them raiſed the breaſts. In the Kingdom of <hi>Sengea,</hi> the Dugs of women hang as low as their Bellies; and in the Iſle of <hi>Arnabo,</hi> 'tis ſaid they turn them over their ſhoulders to their backs, and there ſuckle their children.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Shape</hi> is roundiſh. They repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as it were an half Globe. And in<note place="margin">Their Shape.</note> ſome becauſe of their over-great weight they hang down.</p>
               <p>The Dug is <hi>divided</hi> into the Nipple<note place="margin">Their Parts.</note> and the <hi>Dug</hi> it ſelf. For in the middle of the Dug there is to be ſeen a peculiar Subſtance, which,</p>
               <p>Is called <hi>Papilla,</hi> the Teat or Nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being ſpungy, like the Nut of a<note place="margin">How the Nipples come to have ſo exquiſite Senſe.</note> Mans Yard, and therefore it will fall and riſe when it is ſuckt or handled. For it hath an excellent and exquiſite Senſe of feeling, becauſe it is as it were the Centre, into which the ends of the Nerves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Veins, and Arteries do meet. Which is apparent from the Delicacy of its Senſe, and the redneſs of its color, a ſure token of Blood brought in by the Arteries, by reaſon of the Concourſe whereof, Chyrurgeons do judg Cancers and other Tumors about the Nipple perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Riolanus</hi> believes that the Skin is doubled, and as it were compreſſed: but the doubling would make it thicker. But the Skin is exceeding tender, eaſily rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed off, and apt to be pained when the Child ſucks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry freely. Only in old women it grows thick. Not is the Nipple any other where made of the Skin ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or folded.</p>
               <p>If the Nipples turn upwards, a Male child is in the Mothers womb, if downwards a Girl according to the Tradition of <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> which hath not been as yet ratified by the confeſſion of women with child.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Number,</hi> there is one Nipple on each Dug. <hi>Hollerius</hi> ſaw two Nipples upon one Dug, which both yielded Milk.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Colour</hi> in Virgins is red, in ſuch as give ſuck it enclines to black and blew, and in them alſo they are more ſticking out, by reaſon of the Infants ſucking; in ſuch as are paſt Child-bearing, the Nipples are of a black color.</p>
               <p>They have a Circle round about them which is called <hi>Areola</hi> the little Parſley-bed, in Virgins pale and knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in ſuch as are with child and give ſuck, brown, in old women black.</p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>bored</hi> through the middle, with very ſmall holes for the Milk to paſs through: For</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Nipple is to be inſtead of a Pipe or Funnel, to put into the Mouth of the Infant, whereout it may ſuck the Milk: Secondly, to ſerve for a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Titillation, whereby Mothers and Nurſes are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed the more willingly, and with a certain Senſe of pleaſure to give their children ſuck.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dugs</hi> do inwardly conſiſt of a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane,<note place="margin">The Dug.</note> Veſſels, Kernels, or rather kernel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Bodies, and Fat: though the two laſt do chiefly make up the Dugs; the Kernels and Fat lye concealed between the Membrane and the Skin.</p>
               <p>Now the fleſhy <hi>Membrane</hi> does faſten the kernelliſh Subſtance which it compaſſes, unto the Muſcles which lye thereunder.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Kernels</hi> are many: In Virgins more hard, in old women conſumed, in ſuch as are with child and give ſuck, more ſwelling and pappie. Yet there is one great one, juſt under the Nipple, which the other leſſer ones do compaſs about, and infinite textures of Veſſels lye between them. <hi>Riolanus</hi> hath obſerved a womans Dug to conſiſt of one continued Kernel, and not of many, the contrary whereto we ſee in ſcirrhous and cancerous Tumors.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> thereof is, to turn Blood into Milk. And the uſe of the fat of the Dug is to encreaſe heat, and to make the Dug of an even round ſhape. And therefore ſuch as have the Fat conſumed by ſome Diſeaſe or old Age, they hang ill favoredly like empty Bladders, and are unfit to make Milk.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Veſſels.</hi> The Dugs receive their Skin and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Veins</hi> from the Axillary, which are called the <hi>Thoracicae Superiores, the upper Cheſt-veins,</hi> which in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with child and ſuch as give ſuck, are often black and blew viſible. They receive other internal Veins, brought thither a long way, that the Blood might be the longer therein wrought, which are termed <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariae</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:41352:47"/>
                  <hi>Venae</hi> or Dug-veins, which deſcend<note place="margin">The Venae Mammariae.</note> on each ſide one, from the Trunk of the Axillary Vein, under the Breſt-bone, to the Glandules or Kernels of the Dugs. Theſe are met by other aſcendent Veins, by the right Muſcles, of which before: and therefore the Infant being born, the Blood is carried no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger<note place="margin">Why Milk is bred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the child is born.</note> to the womb, but to the Dugs, and is turned into Milk. And hence it is that women which give ſuck, have ſeldom their Courſes. Hence alſo, when the Children ſuck over-much, Blood comes out at the nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Yea, it hath been obſerved that a womans cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have come away through her Dugs, and Milk by her womb; howbeit, this is a rare chance.</p>
               <p>But the Matter of Milk, be it what it will, cannot according to the Principles of the Bloods Circulation, be carried by the Veins to the Dugs. The <hi>Venae mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariae</hi> or Dug-veins, do only carry back what remains ſuperfluous, after the Child is nouriſhed, and Milk made. Moreover, they are ſeldome joyned with the Epigaſtrick Veins, and they are too few and ſmall, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to carry ſo much blood from the womb, as may ſuffice a Child that is a liberal Sucker.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Arteries</hi> proceed from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Trunk of the great Artery: and<note place="margin">Their Arteries.</note> from the Subclavian branches, which are joyned after the ſame manner with the Epigaſtrick Arteries, as was ſaid of the Veins. The <hi>Th racicae Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriae</hi> or Cheſt arteries, ſo plentifully and evidently, that in cancerous Tumors of the Dugs, a woman hath bled to death by them, of which caſe I remember ſome Examples. Hence it ſeems more likely, blood is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Dugs to make Milk, which blood being conſumed in fat and elderly women they are therefore none of the beſt Nurſes. Hence it is that women which give ſuck, receive great damage by looſing their blood; contrariwiſe they are advantaged, by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may draw and provoke their blood to their Dugs, as by rubbing them, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Proſper Martianus</hi> and <hi>Petrus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellus</hi> do maintain out of <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> that<note place="margin">The matter of Milk is not Blood as <hi>Martianus</hi> holds.</note> the matter of Milk is twofold, viz. Blood and Chyle: and that the greateſt part of the matter thereof, is preſſed out of Meats and Drinks, not yet digeſted in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, into the Dugs, by the Child ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the womb, and after the Child is born, by the paſſages made wide by ſucking: and that another <hi>ſmall</hi> part is made of blood aſcending from the womb, which is rather to be reckoned as an Efficient cauſe, by reaſon of its Heat, then of a <hi>Material</hi> cauſe.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Blood</hi> alone is not the matter of Milk, beſides the Authority of <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> they prove, becauſe</p>

A ſubtile Spirit and thin Vapors with ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie ſteams, do paſs through the Pores, and not the Chylus, nor blood, according to Nature; for if ſo, then there were no uſe of Veſſels. Nor is the Infant ſatisfied only with Vapors. I willingly acknowledg, that Nature endeavors the tranſlation of Humors from one part to another by unknown wayes, but ſhe does it compelled, and beſides her cuſtomary Courſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the breeding of Milk is a conſtant and ordinary thing.</item>

                  </note> for the Anſwering of the contrary Arguments: You are to Note. 1. That we admit of the Chyle as the remote matter of Milk, but not as the immediate matter thereof. 2. That the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plentifully evacuated by the Milk, is bred again by plentiful meat and drink; and therefore the plenty of Milk ceaſes when there is little drink taken in, as all Nurſes do teſtifie. Morcover, ſuch as are of a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin complexion afford moſt Milk, whereas thoſe that are of a tender conſtitution grow lean by giving Suck. 3. That all the blood which is poured out of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the Dugs, is not turned into Milk, but only the more wheyiſh part, a great deal running back by the Veins into the Heart. 4. That Women which give ſuck have their Courſes, becauſe the Veſſels of the Womb are then more enlarged, then in the firſt moneths of their going with Child: and ever and anon they flow ſparingly from Nurſes, and leave off by fits. Alſo Women that give ſuck ſeldom conceive, unleſs they be of a Plethorick habit of body, that is to ſay full of good blood. Our Women when they would wean a Boy, if their Dugs ſwell, they do by certain Medicines keep back the Milk, by ſtraitning the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, that the matter thereof may not enter nor be drawn that way. 6. That the Breaſt and Dug-Arteries are large, and are more and more widened by continual ſucking. 7. That the Milk doth drink in the faculty of Meats and Purgatives, even by mediation of the Blood, which conſerves the color and faculty of the meats, though ſundry digeſtions have preceded; though vapors alone be raiſed, and the ſubſtance aſcend not. 8. That many things are performed in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, according to the ſingular conſtitution of particular perſons, yea and many things which rarely happen, which is to be underſtood of the Milk, which was in the Dugs of that <hi>Man</hi> at <hi>Cous,</hi> and of other things thence voided.</p>

                  <hi>Nerves</hi> are carried from the Nerves of the Cheſt, eſpecially the fift, for to cauſe<note place="margin">Their Nerves.</note> ſenſe, and they end in the Nipple.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Veſſels, the Dugs have alſo white <hi>Pipes,</hi> according to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation<note place="margin">Their Pipes.</note> of later Anatomiſts, ſpringing from the whole Circumference of the lower part which growing narrower, do alwayes meet together, wherein Milk being made, is preſerved for uſe. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no they are nothing but widened Arteries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming white, becauſe of the change of the milk and the bordering kernels (which I am willing to believe) I leave to acuter Eyes and Wits to determine. They treaſure up the Milk, when there is occaſion of omitting to give the Infant ſuck: and when that uſe is over, they grow as ſmall as the moſt Capillary Veins.</p>
               <p>Their Uſe is, 1. General in Women and Men, to be ſafeguards to the<note place="margin">The uſe of the Dugs.</note> Heart: hence Nature hath given Men of cold Complexions larger Dugs then ordinary; and Women that looſe their Dugs become rough-voiced, according to <hi>Hypocrates.</hi> Nor doth the pectoral Muſcle hinder, which performs the ſame Office, which is <hi>Riolanus</hi> his Objection; for the more noble parts require great fencing, even by the ſmalleſt thing, as the Eyes from the Eye-brows, the Heart from the water in the Heart-bag or Pericardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>II. In women their uſe is to breed Milk, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the young Infant. For the Child was nouriſht by blood in the Womb, and milk is the ſame blood only whitened, ſo that Nature ſeems to have put a trick upon living Creatures by obtruding upon them the gentler appearance of white milk, in place of red blood, as <hi>Plato</hi> hath it. Which is the Cauſe that the People of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Daulphine</hi> did anciently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit their Preiſts, the uſe of milk, as well as of Blood.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Efficient</hi> Cauſe of milk,<note place="margin">The Efficient cauſe of Milk.</note> is not the Womb, where milk was never obſerved, nor do the Dugs breed milk, by that vertue thereof which it ſelf wants; nor of the <hi>Veins</hi> or Arteries, unleſs it be the neareſt, can the vertue be communicated from the Dugs. For as for what <hi>Baronius</hi> relates of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> how when he was beheaded, not blood but milk ran from his Neck, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was a miracle, if true; or a ſerous humor flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, which ſometimes flows from the Arm, when a Vein is opened, and I have ſeen it very like to milk, or finally the Liquor of Kernels being cut, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble milk. But the true efficient cauſe of the milk, is that ſame kernelly fleſh of the Dugs, unto which there is none like, in the whole body. Now it works this moderate Concoction by the propriety of its ſubſtance, and by reaſon of its proper temperament. <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> conceives the milk becomes white, by Reaſon of plenty of heat and ſpirit Book 12. Chap. 1. But I am more enclined to believe, that milk is white, becauſe it is aſſimilated to the Dugs that are of the ſame color.</p>
               <p>Somtimes therefore (though it<note place="margin">Milk may breed in Virgins, Men, Women not with Child, &amp;c.</note> happen ſeldom) milk may be bred in Virgins, and in Women not with Child, according to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>Bodinus</hi> in his Theatre of Nature, of <hi>Joachinus Camerarius</hi> in <hi>Schenkius,</hi> of <hi>Petrus Caſtell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In <hi>Scania</hi> in our Country, a maid was lately accuſed to have plaid the Whore, becauſe ſhe had milk in her Dugs, which nevertheleſs ſhe proved to be a propriety of her Family, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing her young brother who likewiſe had milk in his Breaſts. Infants new born ſhed a wheyiſh milky liquor out of their Nipples. Theſe examples are confirmed by the Authority o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Hypocrates</hi> in the 39. <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> of his <hi>fifth Section,</hi> where Women have milk though neither with Child, nor lately delivered. And this happens, when the Dugs are filled with abundance of ſpirituous blood, and ſuppreſſion of Courſes be joyned thereto: for then the Glandulous ſubſtance digeſts more then is neceſſary to nouriſh the Woman. Yea, in men that are fleſhy, large-dug'd, and cold, of conſtitution, a milky humor, and as it were milk is frequently ſeen; eſpecially if their Nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be frequently ſuck'r, and their Dugs rubbed, as

Others have ſeen Men, out of whoſe Dugs ſtore of milk came. <hi>Aben-ſina</hi> ſaw ſo much milk milked from a Man, that a Cheeſe was made thereof. <hi>C. Schenkius</hi> relates that <hi>Laurentius Wolfius</hi> had ſtore of milk in his Breaſts, from his youth, till he was fifty years old. <hi>Jo. Rhodius</hi> had ſuch an Hoſt in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Santorel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> knew a <hi>Calabrian,</hi> who his Wife being dead, and he unable to give wages to a Nurſe, did nouriſh his own Child with his own milk. <hi>Walaeus</hi> ſaw a Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of like Nature, who being even forty years of Age, could milk abundance of milk out of huge Dugs which he had. <hi>A. Benedictus</hi> relates the ſtory of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that gave his Son ſuck. And <hi>Nicolaus Gemma, Veſalius, M. Donatus, Aqua-pendens, H. Eugubius, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricellus,</hi> do witneſs the ſame thing, and I have allrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy told you as much of a Boy of <hi>Scania</hi> in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and <hi>Cardan</hi> ſaw a man thirty four years old, out of whoſe Dugs ſo much milk did run, as would have ſuffiſed to ſuckle a Child. They relate how that in the new world, all men well-near abound with milk. Now that this was true milk which we have related did run from men, is hence apparent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, it was as fit to nouriſh children, as that of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>III. The uſe of the Dugs in Women is to adorne them, and render them the more delectable to Men.</p>
               <p>IV. They ſerve to receive Excrementious moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. Whereupon their Dugs being cut off, Women incur ſundry Diſeaſes; becauſe the blood which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends finding no Veſſels to receive it, runs haſtily into the principal parts, the Heart, Lungs, &amp;c, Which danger I conceive the <hi>Amazones</hi> did ſtudy to avoid, by their ſo vehement exerciſing themſelves in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. Some cut the Dug off when it is cancered, but the operation is dangerous, by reaſon of the bleeding which follows.</p>

               <p>Now they are totally fleſhy, forty four in number, on each ſide two and<note place="margin">Their Number.</note> twenty; eleven external; and as many internal.

               <p>The <hi>External</hi> ones ariſe from the lower parts of the upper Ribs, and deſcending obliquely towards the back-parts, they are inſerted into the upper parts of the lower Ribs. The <hi>Internal</hi> contrary wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But as it is a peculiar muſcle, in Situation, Action, Figure, Nobility, &amp;c. ſo hath it ſomwhat peculiar in this point. But the beginning or Head cannot be in this Centre, becauſe it is moveable, and the Ribs and Vertebrae of the Loyns, in reſpect thereof immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

The point of the Heart doth not ſtrike againſt the Midriff in its pulſation, for the Heart ſmites the breaſt when it is erected in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole, and is contracted at the ſides; in the Diaſtole when it deſcends to the Diaphragma, it becomes ſoft and flaggy, and gives no pulſation.</p>

                  <hi>Note</hi> that Wounds in the Nervous Centre of the Diaphragma, are by all accounted deadly, whether becauſe a Nervous part being offended, doth induce a Convulſion, or becauſe it cleaves to the Pericardium or Heart-bag and to the Liver, or becauſe reſpiration periſhes, and the Heart placed over the ſame is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hurt; for the Pericardium and Liver being hurt, do admit cure.

Otherwiſe, becauſe the Membrane is thick, it hinders the drinking in of thick vapors, and will not let them aſcend without the Veſſels. Among the greater, there is one on the right hand, in the middle of the Nervous part, to give a paſſage to the Vena Cava: Another on the left hand greater and ſomwhat backwarder, for the letting through of the Gullet or Oeſophagus with tw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Contrariwiſe <hi>Fiſhes</hi> which breathe not have a Midriff, but membranous, to ſeperate one Belly from another. In the greater ſort of Sea fiſhes of the whaley kind, I have obſerved a fleſhy Midriff like that of Creatures which live on the Land.</p>
               <p>Now the motion thereof is thus: when the Breath is drawn in, the<note place="margin">How the motion of the Diaphragma is performed.</note> Midriff is ſtretched, when it is blowne out, it is remitted or ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, contrary to the Opinion of <hi>Arantius</hi> and <hi>Laurentius.</hi> Of whom the latter will have the Midriff contrary to all other muſcles to draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its end, and he will have the fibres which run out from the Circumference of the Cheſt, to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contracted, and the ribs to be drawn to the nervous Circle, and ſo to cauſe reſpiration. But how can the membranous Centre of the Septum, draw the ribs to its ſelf and contract the whole Cheſt unleſs haply be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is faſtned to the Mediaſtinum. But I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved more then once in diſſections of living Bodies, that the Midriff is ſtretched out, when the Creature draws in its Breath. For the Guts are driven down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Midriff when the Breath is blown out, and they aſcend again when the Breath is drawn in, which alſo any man without Anatomical Section, may perceive in himſelf, by laying his Hand upon his Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In Wounds of the Diaphragma, the Guts and Stomach, when the Breath is drawn in aſcend into the Cheſt, which <hi>Paraeus</hi> twice obſerved, which differs only according to more or leſs, from the naturall courſe of breathing. Now the motion of the Midriff ought to be ſuch, becauſe the Cheſt when the Breath is drawn in, muſt be widened to receive and contain the Air and ſwoln Lungs; and contrarywiſe, when the Air is breathed out, the Cheſt ought to be ſtraitned, becauſe then the ſooty vapours are expelled, and the Lungs flag and become ſmall again, and therefore in the former caſe the Midriff is lifted up, and in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter depreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jo. Walaeus</hi> beſides that motion, whereby the fleſhy part gives way inwardly, has obſerved another moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Diaphragma during the drawing in of the breath, whereby the fleſhy part thereof being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted into it ſelf, comes to have folds in it, ſo that one portion of the fleſhy part is placed upon another: and he obſerved that this folding is chiefly about the Appendices or Appurtenances, and when the breath is ſtrongly drawn in: and he conceivs that by this means the Midriff is the more ſhortened, and the Cheſt by the lifting up of the Ribs, more widened.</p>
               <p>II. To aſſiſt the muſcles of the belly, in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, when they would force out the Excrements and the Child in the womb: for from above it thruſts the Guts downwards. Hence, according to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>Platerus,</hi> when the belly is coſtive, Sneez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Coughing do help, becauſe thereby the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff and Dung conteined in the Guts, are driven down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, becauſe of the Strugling of the ſaid Midriff and its bearing down, the Excrements of the belly and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine come away of themſelves in live Anatomies and in ſuch as are put to death by hanging.</p>
               <p>III. To diſtinguiſh the lower belly with the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts, from the middle belly with its vital parts, leaſt from the Ignoble parts frequent vapours ſhould aſcend, to the parts more noble, as the Heart &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IV. According to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> it is the Fan of the lower belly, which fannes and cooles the <hi>Hypocondria</hi> or parts under the ſnort ribs.</p>
               <p>V. Others ſuppoſe it cauſes natural reſpiration, becauſe it depends not upon our will and pleaſure, and moves when we are aſleep, and never ſo much as think of it, and by help thereof, Men in Apoplexies do for a ſeaſon breathe. But <hi>Piccolhomineus</hi> does more rightly aſſign a voluntary motion thereunto, howbeit only when ſome neceſſity conſtrains, as in eaſing of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, piſſing, and fetching of breath, becauſe it is a Muſcle of a nature by it ſelf; but not a motion <hi>abſolutely</hi> or ſimply voluntary, which is diſcerned in progreſſion &amp; apprehenſion, that is to ſay in going and handleing.</p>
               <p>Its motion ceaſes in a ſtrong Apoplexy, only tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration does then remain: but in a light Apoplexy, we ſee the Diaphragma alſo moved with the Cheſt muſcles.</p>

For after that the Pleura having taken its Original a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Back hath aſcended by the ſides to the Breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, taking its courſe again towards the Back-bone, it is carried right out from the middle of the Breſt to the Back. Being faſtned on each hand to the ſides of the Breſt-bone, this Membrane is not obſcurely dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as is the Pleura, but viſibly, being conſtituted of the Pleura doubled; and there ſeems at firſt ſight to be as great a ſpace between both, under the Breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, as the breadth of the Breaſt-bone comes to. But this is only in appearance and not really ſo; for that ſame Cavity under the Breaſt-bone, is then only cauſed, when the Breaſt-bone is in diſſection, plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckt from the Mediaſtinum, for before the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Mediaſtinum are moſt cloſely united one to another.

               <p>It ariſes at the Baſis from the Coates which compaſs the Veſſels of the<note place="margin">Its Original.</note> Heart, which proceed from the Pleura (for this Coat is not between the Baſis of the Heart and the Pericardium) where for their ſakes.</p>

               <p>If it happen to be in two great a quantity, Palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Heart, and a ſuffocating death follows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from: if it be quite conſumed, a Conſumption of the body happens. But that it may be bread a freſh when it is ſpent, we ſee clearly in thoſe whoſe Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag being wounded, the ſaid Liquor hath run out; for in <hi>Johannes Saviolus,</hi> his Heart-bag being wounded with a Dagger, water iſſued at every Pulſe of his Heart, out of the wound, yet was he happily cured by the Renowned <hi>Veſlingus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence this water ſhould have<note place="margin">Whence the liquor in the Heart-bag proceeds? The firſt Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> its original, the opinions of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men are different.</p>
               <p>I. The firſt Opinion is of thoſe, who will have it to be ſent out of the Veſſels of the Heart, ſeeing Blood-letting cures the Panting of the Heart procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Super abundance of this Liquor: And they conceive that this wateriſh Liquor is forced out by the fervent heat of the Heart, as in a ſtick of wood when it burns the ſap runs out. Of kin to this is the Opinion of <hi>Nicolas Maſſa,</hi> which will have it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ſtrainings of the blood, which come from the Liver to the Ear of the Heart. And <hi>Hofman</hi> is much of his mind, who maintaines that it is part of that wheyiſh moiſture which aſcends to the Heart with the blood; but becauſe the motion thereof is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, there would no ſmal danger ariſe, from ſo large an Afflux of Humors. I let paſs, how that the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger perſons, whoſe blood is moved moſt ſwiftly, have leſs quantity of this Water then thoſe that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</p>
               <p>II. Others, and among them <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeems to make one, will have it to proceed from our drink, ſome portion whereof they conceive peirces like Dew out of the <hi>Aſperia Arteria,</hi> into the <hi>Arteria Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Some conceive it proceeds from a Watry matter in the Seed, as the inbred Air of the Ears, is thought to proceed from a windy matter in the ſaid ſeed.</p>
               <p>IV. Of kin hereunto is the opinion of <hi>Jaſolinus,</hi> who will have it to be a ſelect, moſt perfect and Elaborate portion of the ſerons Humor, ſent thither by Nature it ſelf, haply in the firſt formation of the Child, through the Veins and Arteries, beſides another part of the drink, of which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaks, and he has experiments touching the ſame.</p>
               <p>V. Some ſay it proceeds from the watry Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the third digeſtion.</p>
               <p>VI. Others from the ſpittle, ſlipping out of the Kernels of the Tongue into the Wezand, and from thence into the Arteries and Heart.</p>
               <p>VII. Others, from the fat of the Heart, by agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on turned into water.</p>
               <p>VIII. Others from the thicker part of the Air which we draw in, being changed into water.</p>
               <p>IX. And laſtly, ſome think (which I conceive to be moſt likely) that it proceeds from moiſt Vapors and Exhalations, forced out of the Humors of the Heart by the motion and Heat theerof, and thruſt forth into the Heart-bag and there congealed into water, in regard of the compactneſs of the ſaid Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is, I. To moiſten and cool the<note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note> Heart, and to facilitate the motion thereof. And therefore thoſe in whom it is conſumed, have their Hearts roaſted: As it happened to <hi>Caſimire</hi> the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41352:52"/>
Marques of <hi>Brandenburg:</hi> And to that young man of <hi>Rome,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Panarolus. Hofmannus</hi> being of a contrary mind, will needs have it to be as a Spur and Incitement of Heat; as Smiths are wont to dip their wiſps of Straw in Water that they may burn the longer: And as Wood is ſprinkled with Water to make it burn more luſtily. But thoſe bundles of Straw are preſerved by the water, becauſe their ſubſtance being made more moiſt and Tenacious, is not ſo ſoon conſumed. But the heat of the Heart is preſerved by its radical moiſture, and by the blood continually flowing in, nor doth it need any Incitement from the Water, for if ſo, then the Heart would be more hot and luſty in old perſons, who have moſt water in their Heart-bags, II. It ſerves to make fat by congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. III. That the Heart by ſwimming therein, may be leſs ponderous, and may not ſtrike againſt any part.</p>
               <p>An HUMOR likewiſe is commonly found in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> of the <hi>Cheſt,</hi> reſembling blood and water mingled together, wherewith the parts of the Cheſt are ſmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they may not be overheated nor overdryed. Hence the ſide of our Saviour being opened, blood and water flowed out, which by the ſuddan flux, and mixture of blood and the Authorities of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, I have at large proved, in my Diſpute of the ſide of Chriſt, againſt <hi>Laurentius, Arias Montanus, Bertinus, Nancelius, Poza, Tremellius, Beza, Tirinus, Grotius</hi> and others, who would have it to proceed from his Pericardium or Heart-bag, alſo againſt <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Tarnovius, Brentius, Laurenbergius</hi> among the late writers, and <hi>Cyprianus, Prudentius, Brigitta, Vida, Sannazarius, Vigerius, &amp;c.</hi> who would fetch it from the Veſſels of the Heart being wounded. Now the Objection of <hi>P. Laurenbergius</hi> is not worth a button, who ſaies there was not enough of the ſaid Liquor in the Cavity of the Cheſt; becauſe 1. The natural quantity might ſuffice, ſeeing the Evangeliſts do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that it come away in a great quantity. 2. It might be augmented in that laſt conflict for life, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great perfection of his Body, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our Redemption made liable to temporary paſſions, underwent death it ſelf. 3. I have at <hi>Padua</hi> ſomtimes obſerved ſo great a quantity of Water in this part, that it hung down like a great purſe, the Midriff being depreſſed by its weight. <hi>Jaſolinus</hi> in wound of the Cheſt (the inner parts being unhurt) did ſomtimes collect every day five meaſures of water called <hi>Heminae,</hi> for thirty daies together, which the Membranes being inflamed, was dried up and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but when the Inflammation was cured, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in its former Quantity.</p>
               <p>In a Boy at <hi>Paris,</hi> who died of the ſmall pox, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, ſtore of water was found in this part, but of a green colour, of which elſe-where.</p>

Chap. 15. <hi>Galen</hi> relates that beaſts ſacrificed have lowed at the Altar, after their Hearts were taken out; and the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> tells of a man who ſpake three or four words of a prayer, when his Heart was pluckt out of his Body, and in the hand of the Executioner. <hi>Plinie</hi> tells us the entrails were twice found without any Heart, when <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſacrificed, and <hi>Julius Obſequens</hi> ſaies the ſame. The Lives of ſuch perſons were maintained by the remainders of arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Blood. And <hi>Spigelius</hi> ſuſpects that among the Bowells, the Heart was rather hid, and unfound then wanting, who ſaw ſo much fat in an Oſtrich, that a man might eaſily have bin deceived, ſo as to think the Fowl had no Heart. Peradventure thoſe Hearts of the ſacrifices were ſtole away by the Devil.</p>
               <p>A Live-wight dies not with every hurt of the Heart. For the Heart undergoes all kind of diſeaſes. 1. <hi>Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> witneſs <hi>Galen,</hi> in a peſtilential and a putrid Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. 2. The <hi>Conſumption</hi> according to <hi>Plinie,</hi> to be dried like a roaſted warden, according to <hi>Jordanus.</hi> to be wholly conſumed by immoderate Heat, as <hi>Tileſeus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verr's. 3. <hi>Inflammation,</hi> in which Caſe it cannot live a natural day, as <hi>Saxonius</hi> found by experience in a certain Reader. 4. <hi>Filthy hollow Ulcers</hi> have bin found therein by <hi>Fernelius, Trincavellius, Riverius.</hi> 5. Divers kinds of <hi>Tumors, Columbus</hi> ſaw an hard Tumor in the left ventricle of a Cardinal, as big as an Egg. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venius</hi> ſaw a ſwelling of black fleſh. <hi>Maſſa, Hollerius, Bauhinus,</hi> and <hi>Joubertus,</hi> have other like Stories. I late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found in the Parenchyma of an Oxes Heart on the left ſide a ſwelling as big as a Pigeons Egg, in a double Coat, full of Whey and Flegm.</p>
               <p>On the out ſide <hi>Geſner</hi> ſaw an Excreſcence of Fleſh, in the Baſis the quantity of an ounce and ſix drams <hi>Bavius</hi> makes mention of the Membrane eaten and fretted away round about.</p>
               <p>Alſo Hiſtories ſhew that it will bear wounds for a ſeaſon. <hi>Paraeus</hi> tells of one wounded in the Heart who ran two hundred paces. <hi>Jacotius</hi> tells of an Hart that carried an old arrow fixed in its Heart, which is confirmed by <hi>Thomas à Vega</hi> and <hi>Alexandrius. Galen</hi> ſaw an Hare wounded in the Heart, run a darts caſt after the wound received. Of a Student at <hi>Ingolſtade, Sennertus</hi> and <hi>Iohnſtonus</hi> tells us, who had both the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles of his Heart peirced through with a weapon, and <hi>Nicholas Mullerus</hi> of a Souldier who lived fifteen daies after he had received a wound in his Heart, of which he hung up a Table at <hi>Groeningen.</hi> He recounts many like examples ſeen by himſelf, and <hi>Tulpius</hi> tells us of one that lived two daies, being wounded in the right ventricle. <hi>Glandorpius</hi> tells us after <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> that the Heart of a Rabbit was pierced with a ſharp Inſtrument, and yet it lived many months after.</p>

Otherwiſe, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Heart differs according to the Difference of the Age and Temperament. For perſons cold of Conſtitution, and fearfull have great Hearts, but ſuch as are more hot and confident, have little Hearts: Of which ſee <hi>Donatus.</hi> Hence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaies of fearfull Creatures, as the Hare, Deer, Mouſe, Hyena, Aſs, Weazel, &amp;c. that they have a great Heart, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the proportion of their bodies. The Philoſiphers of <hi>AEgypt,</hi> in ancient times, as appears by <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his Euterpe, have dreamed theſe things of the greatnes of the Heart. That the Heart of ſuch Perſons, as are not waſted by any violent diſeaſe, does every yeer grow two drams heavier, till they become fifty yeers old, ſo that a man of fifty yeers Age, his Heart weighs an hundred drams: but from the fiftyeth year to the hundredth, by a retrograde or back motion, it looſes every yeer two drams, till it vaniſh away, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty die.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is conick, becauſe it ends in a point.

In its Baſis, it is not ſo much ſofter as thinner. whoſe Veſſels and Ears do recompence what it wants of firmneſs. Now this fleſh hath all kinds of Fibres, ſo mingled one with another, and ſo compact, that they cannot be eaſily diſcerned; partly for ſtrength, partly for motion. For all theſe Fibres being ſtretched in the Syſtole of the Heart they draw together the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles and the inner ſides, to help the Protryſion or thruſting forward of the blood.</p>

Vapors of the Heart, without any Veins. The <hi>true Uſe</hi> of the <hi>Coronary</hi> Vein is, to bring back the blood of the other Veins, when it returnes from nouriſhing the heart, into the right Ventricle again, which the Situation of the Valves doth hint unto us, and the unfitneſs of this blood to nouriſh the ſolid ſubſtance or <hi>Parenclyma</hi> of the heart.</p>
               <p>It hath two Coronary <hi>Arteries</hi> from the great one, at the ſame place, in its original, before it paſſes out of the Pericardium, furniſhed with a Valve which prohibits the regreſs of the Blood. Through theſe, becauſe they are moved and Pulſe, blood is carryed to nouriſh the heart and Ears, and here is made a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar kind of <hi>Circulation,</hi> as <hi>Harvy</hi> teaches, out of the left Ventricle into the Arteries, out of them into the Coronary Veins, out of which it ſlides into the right Ventricle, being to be forced again through the Lungs into the left Ventricle.</p>
               <p>Now ſome men perſwade themſelves, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Hogelandius,</hi> that the Blood which remains after Nutrition, doth not all paſs back through the Veins, but that ſome particles thereof ſweat through the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma</hi> into the Ventricles, and cauſe Fermentation in the Generation of Arterial blood. But 1. The Fermentation, if there be any, may be made by the reliques contained in the Cavities. 2. The coronary Veſſels, do not reach unto the Ventricles. 3. Tis hard when the body is in health, for the blood to ſweat through ſo hard and compact a fleſh, unleſs the blood be very wheyiſh, and the body of a thin Texture. 4. Why doth not the blood ſweat through the Skin, which in ſome parts is very thin? 5.

The heart hath not many Nerves, but a great Contexture of Fibres like to the Nerves, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> perhaps reckoning for Nerves, ſaid the heart was the Original of the Nerves.

               <p>As to the paſſive Quallities, the Heart is moiſt, viz. more moiſt then the Skin, but drier then the Muſcles, becauſe harder: for the parts of the bodie, look how much ſofter they are then the Skin, by ſo much are they moiſter then it. It is a moſt rare Caſe for a mans Heart to be ſo ſolid, denſe and compact, as that it will not burn, ſuch as was the Heart of <hi>Germanicus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Druſus;</hi> or cartilaginous, ſuch as <hi>Riolanus</hi> obſerved in a wicked fellow.</p>
               <p>The primary <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Heart.</p>
               <p>1. According to <hi>Harvey, Baccius,</hi> and other of his followers, is no other then to be the Inſtrument of the Soul, to force and urge the venal blood received from the Ears into the Arteries, by whoſe aſſiſtance it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes Nutriment to the whole body, and is rather joyned as an Aſſiſtant to the Ears, that being of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er force, it may ſupply the defect of the Ears.</p>
               <p>But this is a ſecondary uſe of the Heart. For 1. Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to be prepar'd &amp; filled with vital heat, which it has not elſe where ſave from the heart. 2. Nature might have provided for this paſſage of the blood, by ſome other member not ſo laboriouſly framed, 3. The neceſſity of the Heart would not be ſo great as it is. 4. It is a ſigne that ſome farther thing is performed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:41352:54"/>
the Heart, in that venal blood does not nouriſh, before it enters the Heart.</p>
               <p>Now the primary action of the Heart is to be.</p>
               <p>II. The <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Heat,</hi> whence it is ſpred into the whole body, whereby the parts are animated and ſuſtained. Swowneing teaches ſo much and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Heart, in which the heat of the Heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intercepted, the Members of the Body begin to flag and being deſtitute of heat, become ſtupid. And therefore cordials do good in ſuch caſes, which ſtir up the languiſhing and nummed heat of the Heart. Alſo the Diſſection of living Creatures does ſhew, that the Heart is hot, yea that the heart of a Creature being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out and newly dead, a warm finger, or ſome other warm thing being laid upon it, is ſeen to come to its ſelf again and to ſtir, which the Lord <hi>Bacon Conſtantine, Harvey,</hi> and others have obſerved in a Dove, an Eele, a Salmon, and a Man.</p>
               <p>It is therefore the Fountain of Heat, both in reſpect of its <hi>Subſtance</hi> and of the <hi>Blood</hi> contained in it. I joyn both together. For the Heat ſprings not from the blood alone, as <hi>Harvey</hi> would have it, for the Heart in an Egg, and a Child in the Womb, before it is perfect and hollowed with ventricles, is hot and moves, and the ſame heat remains in Hearts taken out of the Body and cut up. The blood which flows thither from the Coronary Veſſels, flowes thither for Nutritions ſake and to preſerve the Heat. Nor are the reſt of the ſanguine parts, therefore judged to be hotter then other parts becauſe they more abound with any heat, but becauſe they have Arteries full of arteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al blood, and depend upon the influence of the heart, wherewith the blood is heated. So that unleſs all the blood did paſs through the heart, the parts would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grow hot, and the further the blood goes from the heart, by ſo much the ſloer in its motion, and the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it growes. That the coldneſs of the heart makes the parts of the Bodie cold, though full of blood, the ſlowneſs of the Pulſe is a ſign.</p>
               <p>Nor do the Blood and Heart grow hot only from the motion of the Heart, as the followers of <hi>Des Cartes</hi> wil have it, for 1. they grant that the fiery atomes or indiviſible particles of fire, are excited and put into action by motion, though they are only brought into play, but not produced by the ſaid motion. 2. Many things are moved without waxeing hot, as water, unleſs they have an inbred principle of heat. 3. Before moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there was heat proceeding from the ſeminary origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which is afterwards <hi>preſerved</hi> by continual motion.</p>
               <p>III. Not ſo much to make as to perfect the Blood.</p>
               <p>It makes Arterial Blood and perfects the venal, or that which<note place="margin">Whether the Heart doe perfect the Blood.</note> is contained in the Veins. For they are out who attribute too much to the heart, as if the heart alone did make blood of the Chylus, they alſo are miſtaken, who maintaine that the heart contributes nothing to blood-makeing. I goe in a middle way. The Liver challenges the firſt makeing of the blood of the Chylus, as I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated, which becauſe it is not there perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being to thick and unfit to nouriſh, it is neceſſary that it ſhould receive its perfection from other parts. No part is fit for this work ſave the heart, which is one of the firſt parts generated in the Womb, and through which in a grown perſon all the blood in the body has its paſſage. That the Lungs and heart-ears ſhould perform their Office, no man will beleive.</p>
               <p>The heart perfects <hi>two ſorts</hi> of <hi>Blood, that of the Liver</hi> and <hi>that of the Veins.</hi> That of the Liver is twofold, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> of the Vena portae, the other a cruder ſort newly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>f Chyle. The <hi>Vein</hi> blood i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> likewiſe twofold one of the deſcendent trunk of vena cava, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the aſcendent trunk of the ſaid vein. It receivs the Liver blood through the Cava, to which another joyns it ſelf out of the lower and upper Truuk, which remaining over and above after the parts are nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by its long journey is become pauled and ſluggiſh, and has loſt its heat, which is neceſſary for pulſation and nutrition.</p>
               <p>This perfection which the Blood receivs from the heart, is hereby confirmed, in that the blood when it comes out of the left Ventricle, has not altogether the ſame Conſiſtence nor Colour, which it had when it entred the right Ventricle. The diverſity conſiſts in <hi>Heat</hi> and plenty of <hi>Spirits,</hi> wherewith it is furniſhed when it goes out of the heart, and which it wants when it enters thereinto; and in <hi>Effect</hi> or <hi>Operation,</hi> for that which goes out is fit to nouriſh, but that which enters in is moſt unfit, Vital Spirits are added by the inbred faculty of the heart, and the ſooty vapors are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by that moſt ſhort Concoction, being evacuated by the Lungs and Pericardium or heart-bag.</p>
               <p>For what parts does the heart perfect and renew the blood.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ancients</hi> did beleive that the Heart made blood only to nouriſh the <hi>Lungs.</hi> But the Veſſels of the lungs are greater then is requiſite only for their Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and there is continually more blood forced thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the pulſation of the right Ventricle, then could any waies be uſeful for the Lungs, unleſs they were to be nouriſhed with as much blood as is ſufficient for the whole Bodie. And that all is not conſumed upon the ſubſtance of the Lungs, the blood which returnes is a witneſs, which runs in great plenty at every pulſation, to the left Ventricle, through the Arteria venoſa, which in live anatomies being tied, is ſeen to ſwell betwixt the ligature and the Lungs. For there is no way for it to return into the right Ventricle, the paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtopped by the cloſe ſhutting of the mitre-faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Valves.</p>
               <p>The right Ventricle therefore is buſied about blood which is to be ſent to nouriſh the Lungs; the left doth perfect the blood which flows back from the Lungs, being there impraegnated with air, for the Nutrition of the whole Bodie. For the arterial blood alone is that which nouriſhes, becauſe it is only fit for nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it alone is forced through the Arteries into the utmoſt parts of the Bodie.</p>
               <p>To perfect this blood many things<note place="margin">What things are requiſite to perfect the Blood?</note> concur. 1. <hi>Heat,</hi> which is very dull and laſie, as well in the crude blood of the Liver, as in the returning blood of the whole Body. 2. <hi>Vital Spirit</hi> which by the confeſſion of all men, ought to be joyned therewith, 3. <hi>Light</hi> the companion of the Spirits, by which the blood receives a more Illuſtrious color, is moved and made fit for Nutrition. 4. A certain light and momentary Concoction, ſweetning the crude: parts, attenuating the whole ſubſtance, and drawing forth the latent flame. 5. The whole <hi>Fabrick</hi> of the heart, internal and external, and the Veſſels both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and expelling. 6. The ſeparation of Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though the receptacles of the ſaid Excrements are not very manifeſt. The <hi>ſooty Vapors</hi> of the right Ventricle do evaporate through the <hi>Vena Arterioſa.</hi> The <hi>Watry Vapors</hi> of both the Ventricles, are congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the water of the Heart-bag, and are ſpent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſubſtance of the Hairs under the Arms. The <hi>remaining Excrements</hi> continue mixed with the Blood, and are carryed into the Arteries, and the wheyiſh parts are purged by the emulgent Arteries into the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41352:54"/>
Kidneys, and by ſweats into the habit of the Body, the thicker parts by the Hemorrhoidal Arteries and the Ramus Meſentericus. Some parts return with the blood through the Veins into the Heart, that by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral repeated courſes, there, they may be at laſt maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and overcome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether or no is the Blood equally perfected in the right and left Ventricle?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Although the heat of both the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles doth ſeem to be equal, becauſe in Mankind they are both made of ſpiritful ſeed, and as much is afforded to the right Ventricle by the Liver-blood, and the returning blood of the Veins, as to the left by the Lungs; moreover in Live Anatomies we can hardly perceive that the one is hotter then the other.</p>

               </list>
               <p>IV. A fourth uſe of the Heart is perpetually to move. 1. That it might preſerve the Blood and all parts of the Body from putrefaction. 2. That it may help the heat and Elaboration of the Blood. 3. That it might kindle and ſtir up the vital Light. 4. That it might ſend fitting nouriſhment to all parts.</p>
               <p>This motion of the Heart is termed PULSUS the PULSE, which is continual<note place="margin">What the Pulſe is.</note> without ceaſing, raiſed by the influent Blood, and the Pulſifick or Pulſative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, there reſident.</p>

                  </gap> Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of living Bodies and reaſon ſhall Dictate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Syſtole,</hi> being the proper and natural motion of the heart, is a contraction and drawing of the heart into a narrow compaſs, that the blood may by that means be forced out of the right Ventricle through the Vena Arterialis, into the Lungs, and out of the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle through the Aorta into the whole Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> being an accidental motion, is the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the heart, that Blood may be drawn in through the Vena Cava into the right Ventricle, and through the Arteria venoſa into the left,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peri-ſyſtole</hi> is a certain reſt and ſtop going between both motions, when the Blood is about to enter into or go out of the Ventricles, ſo ſmal in healthy perſons that it cannot be diſcerned, being very manifeſt in ſuch as are at the point of death, It is only one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Syſtole and Diaſtole, or between the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole and Syſtole. This is the natural ſtate of the heart.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe motions two others are Obſerved.</p>
               <p>1. A certain Undation or waving towards one ſide according to the carriage of the right Ventricle, as if it did gently wreath it ſelf, as we ſee in an horſe when he is drinking; of which <hi>Harvey</hi> ſpeaks. 2. A <hi>tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> motion of the Heart, when it is cut in ſunder. The former depends upon the Situation of the right Ventricle: The latter is preternatural to the heart, not ariſing from other particles or ſmal Bodies, ſent in by the Coronaria, which is then cut in ſunder, but from the remainders of the vital Spirits.</p>
               <p>We are taught by the teſtimony of<note place="margin">The Heart takes in Blood in the Diaſtole.</note> our Eyes, that in every <hi>Diaſtole</hi> blood is plentifully received in, and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Syſtole</hi> plentyfully expelled, both into the Vena Arterioſa and the Aorta. This appears I ſay to our Eye-ſight.</p>
               <p>1. By Ligatures or bindings in live Anatomies. If the <hi>Cava</hi> and the <hi>Aorta</hi> with the Veſſels of the Lungs ſhall be bound or preſſed down with the Finger or any other Inſtrument on either ſide; we ſhall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly perceive that the part of the <hi>Cava</hi> which is inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Heart is made empty; that in the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of the Ear, it is filled, and thereby the Heart; and that the other part of the Aſcendent and Deſcendent Vein, on this ſide the Ligature, doth ſwel. In like manner, the <hi>Arteria Venoſa</hi> being tied near the heart, by the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of the left Ear, it is made void and empty on this ſide the Ligature where it looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the heart, but towards the Lungs it ariſes and ſwels. The Arterial Veſſels of the heart, do ſhew themſelves in a contrary faſhion: For the <hi>Vena Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſa</hi> being tied, it ſwels towards the heart, becauſe it is filled by the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the right Ventricle; the <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Magna</hi> being bound, ſwels between the heart and the Ligature, being filled by the <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the left Ventricle.</p>
               <p>2. Beſides the Ligatures, we may gather as much from the veſſels being opened or wounded. The <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Arterioſa</hi> and the <hi>Aorta Arteria</hi> being opned by a Lancet, at every <hi>Syſtole</hi> or Elevation and Contraction of the heart, it pours forth plenty of blood, as long as the heart continues ſtrong, for when it languiſhes, it intermits ſome Pulſes, before it voids any Blood. Now we obſerve no ſuch thing, when the <hi>Cava</hi> or <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Venoſa,</hi> are opened between the heart and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature.</p>

               <p>4. The ſwelling of the Heart and the Flagging thereof, being Palpable and viſible to the external ſenſe, do ſufficiently demonſtrate, when it is made ſtrait in the Syſtole, that of neceſſity ſomwhat muſt be ſqueezed out as it were forcibly, and that when it is widened in the Diaſtole, it muſt needs be filled with humors.</p>
               <p>5. The Ventricles in the Diaſtole appear greater, and in the Syſtole leſſer.</p>
               <p>6. From the largneſs of the Veſſels of the Heart: the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and <hi>Arteria Venoſa,</hi> do open into the heart with wider mouths, then to ſuffer only a ſmal quantity of blood to enter.

heart, and the temper of Animals, their Age, Sex, courſe of Diet and Life, &amp;c. It is apparent to our Eyes in live Anatomies, that much is received and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. But it moves not in and out in ſo great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities in perſons that are well in health, when the Heart is more quiet and hath the command of it ſelf. The Antients ſuppoſed that a drop or two was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at a time, and that the blood did freely paſs and repaſs the ſame way. But one drop of blood unaltered, is not able to fill the heart, nor doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it to pulſation, not to ſpeak how the foreſaid experiments do ſhew the plenty that paſſes to and fro. Now the Valves do hinder the free paſſage and repaſſage of the blood by the ſame waies, of which the three pointed ones or <hi>Tricuſpides</hi> ſo called, do hinder the blood which enters the heart from paſſing back the ſame way, and the Mitre-ſhap'd Valves do hinder the blood which goes out of the heart from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the ſame way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Later Phyſitians,</hi> are divided in their opinions. Some ſuppoſe that a drop or two is either ſo rarified as to fill the heart, amongſt whom is <hi>Des Cartes;</hi> or is turned into ſpirit, as <hi>Riolanu's Primroſe, Leichner</hi> and others ſuppoſe, who meaſure it by grains, whom we ſhall anſwer when we come to the <hi>Cauſes:</hi> Others being Patrons and favourers of the circular motion of the blood, as <hi>Harvey, Walaeus, Conringius, Slegelius, &amp;c.</hi> do calculate the quantity, by ounces, drams and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>To clear up this Queſtion, three things are to be conſidered, 1. How much blood is contained in the Diaſtole of the heart. 2. How much is expelled or driven out of the heart, in its Syſtole; whether all that enters the Heart in its Diaſtole, is ſquirted out in the next Syſtole. 3. How many pulſations the heart makes in one hour; or how often the heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives ſomwhat by its Diaſtole, and expels ſomwhat by its Syſtole, in the ſpace of an hour.</p>
               <p>1. In the heart being in its <hi>Diaſtole, Harvey</hi> hath found above two ounces of blood. Alſo <hi>Plempius</hi> found near upon two ounces of blood, in the left Ventricle of the heart of a man that was hanged. <hi>Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi> will hardly allow half an ounce in the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of one that was hanged, and ſaies there was more blood in the right Ventricle. <hi>Hogeland</hi> alſo wil have half an ounce or a dram at leaſt, to enter, at every opening of the Ear.</p>
               <p>Now the quantity of all the blood contained in the body, doth ſeldom exceed twenty four pounds, or come ſhort of fifteen.</p>
               <p>2. In the <hi>Syſtole</hi> there is expelled either a fourth part, or a fiſt, or a ſixt, or at leaſt an eight, or all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is contained in the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harvey</hi> ſuppoſes half an ounce in a man, or three drams, or one dram, in a Sheep and a Dog he ſaies a ſcruple. And he proves the ſame by that ſuddain ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of all the blood, if the very leaſt Artery be cut, and becauſe in the ſpace of one half hour, all the blood may be paſſed through the heart, he certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that in every Syſtole of the heart, much blood is expelled. <hi>Conringius</hi> approves of his Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Walaeus</hi> admits of half an ounce, but he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes only one ſcruple, as doth <hi>Slegelius. Regius</hi> has many times obſerved half an ounce, ſomtimes two or three drams, in the heart of a Dog diſſected. <hi>Hoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> contents himſelf with a dram. I being more ſparing ſuppoſe half a ſcruple, in the ſmalleſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the quantity which iſſues in ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore <hi>Conringius</hi> doth rightly ſuſpect that abides there the ſpace of one or two Pulſes, till by little and little it raiſe it ſelf, which I underſtand of the reliques and part of the Blood, not of the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the foregoing Diaſtole.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Primroſe</hi> numbred in one hour 700 pulſations of the Heart. <hi>Riolanus 2000. Walaeus</hi> and <hi>Regius 3000, Harvey,</hi> 2000. in ſome 4000, 6000, 8000. <hi>Cardan 4000. Plempius 4450. Slegelius</hi> 4876. I have told upon mine own wriſt about 4400, But the number varies accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Age, Temperament, Diet &amp;c. of every perſon. So many Syſtoles therefore and ſo many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtoles there will be in one hour, as long as the Heart is vigorous, for a languiſhing heart has more Diaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les then Syſtoles.</p>
               <p>From theſe three Praemiſes I have calculated, how much blood may in an hour be ſquirted out of the Heart, by its ſundry pulſations.</p>

But elſe where, he denies that the Baſis being ſtrongly faſtened to the veſſels, can be drawn towards the Point. And therefore other, whom <hi>he</hi> and <hi>Slegelius</hi> do follow, conceive that it is extended long-waies, that its walls being contracted, it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Blood. But then the Orifices of the Veſſels being drawn downwards in the lengthening of the Heart, would be ſhut, and a contrary motion would happen; beſides that living Anatomies do ſhew, that the heart becomes ſhorter in its Syſtole. Nor can it appear longer but ſhorter, if either the point draws to the Baſis or the Baſis to the point. Both forms ſerve for expulſion of the blood, for whether you preſs a bladder ful of water longwaies or broadwaies, you will ſqueeze out the water as ſoon one way as another.</item>

It differs therefore from <hi>Galens</hi> Syſtole, which <hi>Leichnerus</hi> will have to be drawn likewiſe into it ſelf, the Longitude of the Heart being changed into Latitude.

                  <hi>Chap. VII.</hi> Of the parts of the Heart in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, viz. the Earlets, Cavities, Septum, Veſſels, and Valves.</head>
               <p>THe parts of the Heart which are ſpecially to be conſidered are either externally ſeen as the <hi>Earlets;</hi> or within only, as the <hi>Ventricles</hi> or two Cavities, the <hi>Septum</hi> or partition, and the <hi>Veſſels</hi> with the Valves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Earlets</hi> or little Ears, were ſo termed, not from hearing, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">The Earlets of the Heart why ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</note> of ſome reſemblance in their ſhape. For from a long Baſis they end in a blunt point (howbeit the left is more accumulated) of an obtuſe triangle; and they have a Cavity, that the Ventricles might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced before the Heart. For that ſame pulſing Bladder in an Eg, is the Earlets,<note place="margin">What pulſes firſt in an Eg.</note> becauſe they were neceſſary in the Child in the Womb, though the Heart were not ſo ſoon neceſſary, which afterwards grows upon the Bladder. Others give another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe the Earlets obſerve the ſame proportion in their pulſing as the Bladder had. But this is very hard to diſtinguiſh in the firſt Generation. <hi>Others</hi> take the Bladder for the Heart, whoſe Expanſions or Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets appear red, becauſe they are tranſparent, but the Heart is not ſeen by reaſon of the plenty of Seed, and Pulſe intermitted. I ſuſpect that both may lie hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Veſicula</hi> or bladderkie, but that the Earlets are preſently drawn and moved, becauſe of their uſe. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it would ſeem inconvenient that the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix ſhould be greater then the whole Body. Nor is the Heart a bare Parenchyma or affuſion of blood. It hath Cavities produced doubtleſs out of the foreſaid Bladderkie.</p>
               <p>Now the EARLETS are Proceſſes or Appendixes; and according to <hi>Hofman,</hi> nothing but the Subſtance of the Heart attenuated and widened. Which I know not how true it is. I ſhould rather ſay they ſeem to be the ſubſtance of the neighboring Veſſels dilated, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are made firſt of Seed out of the bladder, and are the firſt motion, and the laſt in dying.</p>
               <p>They are <hi>ſituate</hi> at the Baſis of the Heart, before the Orifices of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels<note place="margin">Their Situation.</note> venal to which they cleave, and whereby they are mediately joyned to the heart.

And both are large in an Embryo or Child in the Womb: the former is joyned to the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> with which it ſeems to be one common body; the latter to the <hi>Vena arterioſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Earlets is peculiar,<note place="margin">Subſtance.</note> ſuch as there is none in any other part; by reaſon of their ſingular uſe. Howbeit they are thin and ſoft, for their more eaſie contraction and nervous for ſtrengths ſake. But the left is more hard, a little more fleſhy and thicker: yet the Heart is not ſo. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they anſwer in a certain proportion to the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Heart.</p>
               <p>Their external <hi>Surface,</hi> when they<note place="margin">Their Surface.</note> are extended and full, is even and boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or bunching (but their circumference unequal) when they are contracted, it is wrinkled; and in the left it is more wrinkled then in the right, becauſe the inner fabrick is more turning and winding, and hath more pits in it, for</p>
               <p>The Earlets being <hi>inwardly</hi> diſſected and ſpread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, do diſcover unto us 1. a certain fleſh-membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>plain,</hi> ſtretched out to the extremities of the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pointed Valves, to which the fibres of the Valves are faſtned. 2.

                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:41352:59"/>Bones are more rarely found in the Hearts of Men. Yet <hi>Gemma</hi> did once<note place="margin">A Bone in the Heart.</note> find ſome, and <hi>Riolanus</hi> twice, in the dead body of preſident <hi>Nicolas</hi> being eighty years of Age, at the beginning of the Aorta, and in the Queen Mother of <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteen King of <hi>France,</hi> being after her deceaſe opened to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed. <hi>Johannes Trullus</hi> ſound one in the Heart of <hi>Pope Urban</hi> the eighth of a triangular Figure repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the letter T. <hi>Simon Pauli</hi> my Renowned Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor in the Anatomical Theatre, took a bone as hard as a ſtone of a Figure of the <hi>Pythagoraean</hi> letter Y, out of the Heart of a Man of <hi>Haſnia</hi> forty years of Age, the bigneſs of a Wallnut, and the ſhape not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Heart. I conceive they are all bred through the dryneſs and ſlow motion of the Humors in aged and ſick Perſons. Yet nature makes uſe of this defect to provoke and quicken the motion of the blood, when it paſſes ſlowly, as waters flow more eaſily when a peice of wood is caſt in, or that all the blood may not clotter, as our Women and Butchers ſtir their blood about with a ſtick, when they intend thereof to make Puddings, that it may not go into Clotters.</p>
               <p>The <hi>right Ventricle</hi> receives blood out of the Vena cava, which Vein it receives into<note place="margin">The right Ventricle.</note> it ſelf: And therefore it hath not ſo thick a fleſh or wal, as the left hath, that their might be an even poiſe, ſeeing it contains more matter, and bears a greater weight then the left. Nor is there ſo perfect a Concoction made in this Ventricle, as in the left in which there is more heat.</p>
               <p>It is not exactly round but ſemicircular, reſembling the Moon encreaſing, nor does it reach to the End of the Point, but it ſeems to be as it were an Appendix to the left Ventricle, which when the left is taken away, ſeems ſtill as it were to repreſent an whole Heart.</p>
               <p>Yet is it deeper and larger then the left, by reaſon of the ſtore of blood, which it was to contain, both to nouriſh the Lungs, and to make vital Spirits in the left Ventricle. For</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To receive blood out of the vena ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, to nouriſh the Lungs, the ſaid blood being poured into the Lungs through the <hi>Vena arterioſa.</hi> Therefore Fiſhes which have no Lungs, and draw no Air in at their Mouths, are without this Ventricle, having no more then one. This right Ventricle therefore, does concoct and attenuate the Blood, for the Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lungs.</item>
                  <item>II. To ſend the thinner part of the Blood through the Septum or partition, into the left Ventricle, to make vital Spirits; and the thicker part through the Lungs, both to nouriſh them, and that it may return to the left ventricle, for the Nutriment of the whole Body.</item>
                  <item>III. Further to perfect and prepare the blood which runs back as ſuperfluous after the extream parts are nouriſhed, and the crude blood which is bred in the Liver.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The <hi>left Ventricle</hi> is narrower, but more noble; having a round Cavity,<note place="margin">The left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle.</note> and which reaches unto the point of the Heart. Its fleſh or wall is three times as thick as that of the right ventricle. Alſo it is harder, that the vital Spirits may not exhale, and that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood might be ſtronger, being to be forced into the fartheſt parts of the body.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to make vital Spirit and Arterial blood, of a twofold matter, I. Of blood prepared in the right ventricle, and paſſed through the Septum and the Lungs. II. Of Air drawn in by the Mouth and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, prepared in the Lungs, and tranſmitted through the <hi>Arteria venoſa</hi> with the blood into the left ventricle of the Heart, to kindle and ventilate the vital flame, yea and to nouriſh the ſame. The latter fiſhes ſtand in need of and Leucophlegmatick perſons, the former ſuch as are ſeated in a narrow or infected place, or are under extream heat, for fear of ſuffocation and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the flame in the Heart.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> therefore of both ventricles is in a manner the <hi>ſame,</hi> viz. to generate Arterial blood, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the venal, and to receive the ſame running back from all parts of the body through the veins, and to expel the perfect blood through the Arteries into the fartheſt parts of the body, that they may be thereby nouriſhed. This is proved by the Conformations of the ventricles, which in part are like one to the other, in the right two veſſels, a Vein and an Artery carrying out, and bringing back and as many in the left. In the former are two ſorts of Valves the trebble poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Mitre-ſhap'd, and the like in the latter. The left expels and receives as much as the right, ſave that it is conſumed in nouriſhing the Lungs and the Heart. Yet their different Conſtitution and Magnitude, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues ſome difference. Whence 1. There is a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Coction in the one and other, as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated above. 2. The right works for the Lungs the left for the whole Body. 3. The right ſends ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Exhalations and blood to the Lungs; the left receives from the Lungs Blood Impraegnated with Aire.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Septum</hi> or <hi>Partition</hi> between the two Ventricles, which is thick like the other Wall of the left ventricle (which <hi>Columbus</hi> once obſerved to be Griſtley) hollow on the left ſide, on the right bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, full of hollowneſſes and holes. which ſome ſuppoſe to be the third ventricle of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> which hollowneſſes or Caves are more large towards the right ſide, but their utmoſt ends towards the left ſide are hardly diſcernable. <hi>Helmont</hi> deſcribes them to be triangular, whoſe Cone ending in the left ventricle, is eaſily ſtopped, but the Baſis of the ſaid triangle in the right ventricle, is never ſtopped ſave in Death. But I have ſeen them Circular ſo that they could eaſily admit a Peaſe, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obtuſe towards the left Hand.</p>
               <p>That they are open is the opinion<note place="margin">Manifeſt Pores in the Septum of the Heart.</note> of the Ancients and of many Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts which follow them. <hi>Gaſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>-holes as it were, and that by lightly putting in his Probe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violence, which he wreathed gently and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it upwards and downwards and to the ſides. And although by a Probe breaking the tender fleſh of the Septum, we may eaſily make a way, yet we may not doubt of the Eyewitneſs of <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> nor of the Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of <hi>Payanus;</hi> ſeeing I alſo of late found the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sows Heart, in many places obliquely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated with manifeſt great Pores, which were open of themſelves without the uſe of a Probe, ſo as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a large Peaſe; but when I put in my Probe, it brought me to the left ventricle, where a thin Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane as it were an Anaſtomoſis was placed, hindering any regreſs. <hi>Riolanus</hi> alſo hath ſeen it bored through towards the point, where it is moſt thin. <hi>Walaeus</hi> in the Partition of an Oxes Heart, did ſomtimes find a Cavity in the upper part according to the length of the Heart, open into the left ventricle about the point
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41352:59"/>
of the Heart, the length and breadth of a Mans Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger, which he conceives to be the third Ventricle mention'd by <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet are they not alwaies open in dead bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in living bodies they are kept open, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual agitation of the Heart, which ceaſing, they are not ſo viſible to the Eye-ſight, even as we ſee no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt paſſages, when the ſweat breaks out plentifully through the Skin, nor when the ſeed breakes out of the Kernels and Spermatick veſſels, into the Urinary paſſage: nor the Pores by which the Empyema or out of the blood out of the vena Arterioſa peirces into the Arteria venoſa, through the ſubſtance of the Lungs, or the blood in the Liver, out of the branches of Porta into the Cava. <hi>Caelſus</hi> is in the right, where he ſaies, that nothing is more fooliſh, then to think that look what and how it is in a living Man, ſo it muſt needs be in one that is dying, Yea that is dead. Whence many (as <hi>Columbus, Spigelius, Hofman, Harvey, &amp;c.</hi>) have denyed that any thing paſſes through this Septum or Partition. But it is no wonder that they make a doubt of it: For,</p>
               <p>I. They are ſo crooked and winding, that a Probe cannot eaſily paſs through them. Howbeit theſe Pores become more conſpicuous, in the Heart of an Ox long boyled, as <hi>Bauhinus, Riolanus,</hi> my ſelf with others can witneſs. And you are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, in oppoſition to <hi>Hofman</hi> and <hi>Plempius</hi> that deny it. that in the boyling a moderation muſt be uſed, and that the Fibres in living Bodies do never ſtick ſo cloſe together, but that they leave Pores, as the Nerves do ſhew, finally, that the quickeſt-ſighted Anatomiſts can ſee no Membrane in the boyled Hearts of Oxen. II. In dead Bodies all paſſages fall in and ſhrink to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. III. That an extream ſtraitneſs was requiſite in the End; becauſe the thinneſt part of the Blood, is ſtrained as it were in that part: And in the mean time, becauſe theſe holes are not in vain, therfore,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Septum or Partition of the Heart, is, that the thinner<note place="margin">Whether the Blood paſs through the partition of the Heart?</note> blood may paſs there-through into the lef ventricle, for the Generation of vital blood and ſpirit, which is afterwards diſtributed through the Arteries into the whole Body, for to preſerve and ſtir up the life and natural heat. But the thicker and greater part of the blood, by a natural and ordinary way, and not a violent only, is communicated to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria venoſa, through the vena Arterioſa, by mediation of the Lungs, that in the left ventricle it may be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with that which ſweats through the Septum. The thicker part is ordained to nouriſh the Lungs, and that it may return back to the left ventricle tis tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with Air. The thinner part paſſing through the Septum, nouriſhes the ſame in its paſſage, becauſe the external Coronary veſſels do only creep through, and in that long and dangerous journey through the Lungs, it would vaniſh away and come to nothing. By this way only ſuch as dive deep into the Sea, and thoſe that are hanged for a ſmal while, do live a while and come to themſelves, after the motion of their Lungs is ceaſed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Septum</hi> or <hi>Partition</hi> doth help forward this paſſage, which that it is moved according to the motion of the Ventricles, I have theſe ſigns and tokens; Becauſe 1. It is furniſhed with Circular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, as well as the Walls, in a boyled Heart, ſuch in a manner as are in the Sphincter Muſcle, as <hi>Harvey</hi> teſtifies, which ſeeing them move the Ventricles, they muſt as well move the Septum. 2. A certain Palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is felt, if you put in your Finger into a living Heart, according to the obſervation of <hi>Walaeus.</hi> 3. In Creatures ready to die, when the motion of the left ventricle ceaſes, the Septum follows the motion of the right Ventricle, as the ſame <hi>Harvey</hi> obſerves: and if the right Ventricle be wounded, <hi>Riolanus</hi> tells us, that the motion remains in the Septum in his <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Yet the ſame <hi>Riolanus</hi> in another place being wiſer, denies that it is moveable, unleſs towards the Baſis where it is ſoft gives way a little, and that ſo it ought to be that the paſſage may be maintained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when the Ventricles are dilated above the through-far'd Septum, and ſtraitned again like Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, the little holes would be ſhut up. But there is no fear. For in the Syſtole, when the point is drawn back to the Baſis, the Pores are opened in the Septum moved upwards, that the blood may at once paſs both the Septum and the Lungs. Contrarywiſe in the Diaſtole, becauſe the Heart is diſtended long waies, the pores are drawn back with the Septum, and are ſhut up, until the Heart be filled.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Heart-veſſels</hi> there are found<note place="margin">Veſſels of the Heart.</note> four remarkeable ones going out of the Heart which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes of Humane Nature. Into the right Ventricle are inſerted two Veins; the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and <hi>Vena Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſa;</hi> into the left, as many Arteries; <hi>Arteria Venoſa</hi> and <hi>Arteria Magna.</hi> Before all which are placed within eleven <hi>Valves</hi> or little dores, made of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of their Veſſels widened and ſtretched out. The Veins which bring in to the Heart, viz. the Cava and Arteria venoſa, have trebble-pointed valves, looking from without inwards; the Arteries which <hi>carry away,</hi> viz. the Aorta and the Vena Arterioſa, have Sigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhap'd or Mitre-faſhion'd valves open inwards, ſhut outwards. The former admit blood into the Heart; being open they ſuffer the blood to flow out, being ſhut they hinder it from returning the ſame way. The trebble-pointed valves do not only wink, but they are cloſe ſhut by the blood diſtending the Heart, and by the conſtriction of the Heart which ſtraitens the veſſels. The Sigmoides or Sigma-ſhap'd are ſhut by the Relaxation and falling in of the Heart in the Diaſtole, whereby the Fibres being ſtretched out long-waies, they are drawn downwards with the Walls and ſo ſhut, like the Chains in Draw-bridges.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Trebble-pointed</hi> or <hi>Tricuſpides,</hi> are opened by the impulſe of new blood through the Cava, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria venoſa, and the Diaſtole of the Heart, whereby the Fibres being drawn downwards, they are opened; But the Mitre-ſhap'd valves, are open'd in the Syſtole by the Conſtriction of the Heart, and the blood urgeing its way out. Alſo they may be praeternatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhut, by the blood expelled and ſtanding ſeated in the full veſſells, to which, endeavouring to run back, they make reſiſtance by reaſon of their confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which Artifice of Nature, we ſee every where imitated by the Flood-gates and Locks made upon Rivers. But that according to nature they are not ſhut by the returning of the expulſed blood, as ſome conceive <hi>Walaeus</hi> proves, Becauſe 1. Our ſenſes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the blood is carried from the Heart, not to the Heart by the Arteries. 2. In a rare and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Pulſe, the Artery doth not riſe or ſwel laſt in the upper part towards the Heart, but it ſwels there firſt. 3. If an Artery be tied two fingers from the Heart, and it be ſo opened betwixt the Ligature and the valves, that the blood may freely paſs forth, yet the valves will divers times ſtraitly be ſhut, and the Heart is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly moved.</p>

               <p>The <hi>firſt veſſel</hi> is the VENA CAVA inſerted into the right Ventricle, with a very large and<note place="margin">Vena Cava.</note> gaping Orifice, three times greater then the Orifice of the Aorta, and therefore it ſeems rather to ariſe from the heart, then from the Liver, eſpecially ſeeing it ſticks ſo firmly to the right Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that it cannot be ſeparated therefrom.</p>
               <p>Whether it hath any <hi>motion</hi> is hard to determine. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> ſeem to have been of that opinion; but the Interpreters expound thoſe places to mean an obſcure motion. But <hi>Walaeus</hi> hath diſcovered a manifeſt motion therein, from the Jugulum as far as to the Liver, but moſt evident near the heart: and that therefore even in that place the Vena Cava is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with fleſhy Fibres, whereof it is deſtitute in other places. Alſo <hi>Ent</hi> hath obſerved that the vena Cava of a dead Beaſt, being with a mans Finger light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched in the Belly near the Thighs of the Beaſt, did expreſs a trembling motion.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to bring in Blood from the Liver, and the whole body, by its aſcending and deſcending Trunks.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Membranous Circle</hi> grows to the Orifice thereof, to ſtrengthen the heart: Which is preſently ſplit into three ſtrong Membranous.</p>
               <p>VALVES, termed <hi>Janitrices,</hi> Gatewarders, looking from without inwards, that the blood may indeed enter; but not return back into the Cava.</p>
               <p>They are termed TRICUSPIDES, trebble-pointed, by the Greeks <hi>Trich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lochines,</hi>

               <p>Twas called a Vein firſt by <hi>Herophilus</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by moſt other Anatomiſts, before the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood was found out, from its Office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſends blood to nouriſh the Lungs.</p>
               <p>Tis termed an <hi>Artery,</hi> I. By reaſon of its Subſtance, which conſiſts not of a<note place="margin">Why call'd an Artery?</note> ſingle Coat, as a vein doth, but of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one. II. Becauſe in a Child in the Womb it performs the Office of an Artery, and Pulſes as ſhall be ſaid in the next Chapter, As alſo in a grown perſon, becauſe it carries Nutritive blood to the Lungs, which is partly wrought in the right ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle.</p>
               <p>This veſſel paſſes out of the heart with a ſmaller Orifice, and yet greater<note place="margin">Its Original and Progreſs.</note> then the Lungs ſtand in need of: For <hi>Columbus</hi> and <hi>Arantius</hi> obſerve, that two Fingers have been thruſt thereinto; and it ought to be the greater, becauſe it receives blood from the continual pulſation of the right ſide of the heart. Moreover, reſting upon the Arteria Magna and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to the left ſide, it goes to the right and left parts of the Lungs with a double branch, a right and a left: Which afterward ſpend themſelves into ſundry branches in the Lungs.</p>
               <p>It <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to receive blood out of the<note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note> right Ventricle, and to carry it to the Lungs for their nouriſhment, and according to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of latter Authors, to paſs over the reſt of the blood through the Arteria venoſa into the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart, and to hinder the blood from ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding back again into the heart.</p>
               <p>Three VALVES are placed therein,<note place="margin">The Sigma-faſhioned Valves.</note> ariſing from the Coat of the vein it ſelf, looking from without inwards, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling an half Circle, or the letter Sigma, as it was anciently figured, and did reſemble the Latine letter C.</p>
               <p>The ARTERIA VENOSA, which others<note place="margin">The Arteria venoſa, why an Arterie?</note> call <hi>Vena Pulmonaria,</hi> is the third Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the heart, which is ſeen in the left Ventricle.</p>
               <p>It is termed an Artery becauſe of its Office: For I. It Pulſes in a grown perſon, becauſe it is united to the left Ventricle, but it moves not by a proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its own, becauſe it is neither an Artery, nor doth it carry pure Arterial blood. II. It is implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the left Ventricle.</p>
               <p>Tis called a VEIN, 1. Becauſe of its<note place="margin">Why a vein.</note> Subſtance. 2. Becauſe in a Child in the Womb, it performs the office of a vein. And it is produced as it were from the Cava, to which it is joyned, by way of Anaſtomoſis. Yea and in a grown perſon, it carries blood alſo to the heart, as doth the Cava.</p>
               <p>It <hi>Ariſes</hi> with a round and great Orifice (greater then that of the Arteria Magna) divided into two parts preſently after its egreſs, juſt in a manner as if it aroſe with a twofold mouth; and it is diſſeminated into the right and left part of the Lungs.</p>
               <p>The Uſe.</p>
               <p>I. In its Dilatation to draw Air to<note place="margin">Whether Air enters into the Heart?</note> the heart, not bare and ſimple Air, but mixed with the blood which returns from the Lungs, for the Generation of vital ſpirits and Arterial blood, and to nouriſh and kindle up the vital flame. For the Arteria venoſa be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened in living Anatomies, doth pour blood and not pure air into the heart, which for the moſt part we obſerve thicker then ordinary in the Carcaſſes of Men and Beaſts, becauſe the motion of the left ventricle ceaſing, the blood received in this vein, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be driven or drawn to the heart. And when the Arteria venoſa is cut or opened, there appears no air, becauſe the air is not pure and ſimple, being mixed throughout with blood. And when the Lungs of a living or dead Creature are by Art blown up, not a jot of air is perceived to come thence to the heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Carriage of blood is wanting, and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Drawer and Driver is alſo wanting. But that the air ſuch as it is, doth come into the heart, their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples do teſtifie, who have been ſtifled with the ſums of Quick-ſilver. Coles, Lime, &amp;c. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Lungs and Lung-pipes were made in vain.</p>
               <p>II. In the Contraction of the Heart to thruſt out a portion of vital blood, into the Lungs, together with
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41352:61"/>
ſooty exhalations; which is an old opinion. But that in the Syſtole of the heart, blood or ſooty ſteams ſhould be carried this way. 1. The Valves hinder, which will not ſuffer any thing to return. 2. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria venoſa being tied, doth ſwel towards the Lungs, and is lank and emptied near the heart. 3. Being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened it pours forth blood on this ſide the band, but beyond it being opened it voids neither blood nor ſooty exhalations. 4. The ſooty ſteams of the right Ventricle, do evaporate through the vena Arterioſa, turn into water in the Pericardium or Heart-bag, breed the hairs in the Arm-pits, and exale into the whole habit of the Body, through the Aorta. 5. The air which goes into the heart, and the ſooty ſteams which go out with the blood, ſhould be carried the ſame way, in contrary motions, which is a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal in the natural courſe obſerved in the body. For though ever and anon Excrements are driven from and Nutriment is drawn to the ſame part, yet the way is different, eſpecially where the afflux is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, as in the Arteria venoſa from the Lungs; or at leaſt they are performed at different times. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>III. In the contraction of the heart, it drives blood which is ſuperfluous after the nouriſhment of the Lungs, or that which runs back, out of the vena Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terioſa, into the left Ventricle of the heart.</p>
               <p>Two VALVES only are placed at the Orifice of this veſſel, which look from<note place="margin">The Mitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhap'd Valves.</note> without inwards (bred out of the Nervous circle which grows out of the ſubſtance of the heart) which being joyned together do reſemble a Biſhops Mitre, They are greater then the Valves of the Cava, have longer threds (and each hath ſeven large ones, beſides little ones annexed to them, which from a broad Baſis do commonly end into a ſharp point) and for ſtrengths ſake very many fleſhy Explantations. Therefore two were ſufficient to ſhut the Orifice cloſe, becauſe they are greater then others, the Fibres longer and larger, the Columnes or Pillars ſtronger, and the Orifice it ſelf is more Ovall-ſhap'd, then that of the reſt.</p>
               <p>The ARTERIA MAGNA or <hi>great Artery</hi> ſo called, becauſe it is the root of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">The Arteria Magna.</note> is another veſſel of the left Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, from whence it proceeds and ariſes.</p>
               <p>At the Orifice hereof, is placed inſtead of a Prop, not in Men, but in certain Beaſts, as Harts, Oxen, Horſes, &amp;c. a certain hard ſubſtance, which is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Griſtly, ſomtimes Boney, according to the greatneſs and Age of the Beaſts. In man the moſt noble and ſtrongeſt, <hi>Harvey</hi> ſaw a portion of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery turned into a round bone, near the Heart, whence he concludes that the Diaſtole of the Arteries, is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the blood alone, not by any Pulſifick faculty, derived through the Membranes. Alſo <hi>Johannes Schroderus</hi> writes that the meeting together of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries in the Baſis of the Heart, was in an heart dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into a bone.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> thereof is, to communicate the Vital ſpirit, with the Nutritive Arterial<note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note> blood, received from the heart, unto all parts of the Body, for Nutrition and life; which that it may not paſs back again into the heart, Three Valves are placed (like thoſe in the vena Arterioſa exactly ſhut) looking from<note place="margin">Its Valves.</note> without inwards, which are termed Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miodes or Sigma-ſhap'd Valves.</p>

                  <hi>Chap. VIII.</hi> How the Veſſels are united in the Heart of a Child in the Womb.</head>
               <p>THe Veſſels in the heart are otherwiſe<note place="margin">In the Child in the Womb.</note> diſpoſed when the Child is in the Womb, then they are after it is born; which though <hi>Galen</hi> knew and made mention thereof; yet the greateſt part of Anatomiſts have either neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the ſame, or have delivered falſities thereabout, by ſaying that the Unions of the veſſels were ſome of them only made by a Chanel, others only by way of Anaſtomoſis.</p>
               <p>But the Conjunctions or UNIONS<note place="margin">The Union of the Veſſels of the Heart.</note> 
                  <hi>of the</hi> VESSELS of the Heart in a Child in the Womb, are twofold:</p>
               <p>One is made by an <hi>Anaſtomoſis,</hi> another by a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Anaſtomoſis</hi> an Union is made of the Vena Cava and the Arteria Venoſa, under the right Earlet, near the Coronaria, before the Cava doth abſolutely open it ſelf into the right Ventricle. The hole is large and of an Oval Figure.</p>
               <p>Now Nature contrived this Union by way of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomoſis, 1. By reaſon of Vicinity. 2. Becauſe of the likeneſs of ſubſtances.</p>
               <p>Before this hole in the Cavity of Arteria venoſa is placed a Pendulous, thin, hard, little Membrane, larger then the hole.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is, I. According to the Doctrin<note place="margin">Its various Uſes.</note> of <hi>Galen</hi> and his Clients, that the blood may be carried through this hole, out of the Cava into the Arteria venoſa (not into the right ventricle, for vital ſpirit is not yet bred, nor do the Lungs need blood ſo attenuated) to nouriſh the Lungs; becauſe they could not otherwiſe be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in a Child in the Womb, becauſe in it the heart hath no motion whereby the blood might be forced out of the right ventricle into the vena Arterioſa: And therefore this Arteria venoſa, is a vein in the Child in the Womb. But that it ſerves the turn of the Heart, and not only to nouriſh the Lungs, divers things <hi>Evince</hi> obſerved by the favorers of the Circular Motion. For 1. The Heart is moved even in an imperfect Child, after the third moneth, as Egs and Embryo's do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. But before the third moneth only a little Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Earlet pants, as in Inſects before the Heart is perfectly hollowed. But this motion were in vain, if the Heart ſhould not receive or expel any thing. 2. The blood by the Anaſtomoſis is immediately poured into the left Ear, and is neceſſarily thence conveighed by the Syſtole of the Heart, into the left ventricle. 3. All the blood is carried through theſe Unions, doubtleſs not for the ſake of the Lungs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, which might be nouriſhed after the ſame manner as in grown perſons, although void of motion, the veins in part gaping. 4. The Child in the Womb is nouriſhed with Arterial blood, which can come from no place but the Heart, as ſhall be demonſtrated here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Therefore,</p>
               <p>II. The true uſe is, that it might conveigh part of the blood in a Child in the Womb, out of the Cava of the Liver, into the left ventricle of the Heart, which cannot go thither the ordinary way, the Lungs neither dilating themſelves nor Reſpireing. In which paſſage the right ventricle alſo draws ſomwhat to it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:41352:61"/>And that the blood may not ſlide back into the Cava, a little Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane<note place="margin">The uſe of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Membrane.</note> there placed hinders, when it fals in and ſettles.</p>
               <p>A little while after the Birth this<note place="margin">'Tis ſhut after the Birth.</note> Hole grows together and is dried up, ſo that a man would think the place had never been perforated, and that by reaſon of the plenty of blood in a grown perſon, forced out of the Lungs now opened and inlarged directly to the left Earlet, which ſuffers not a ſmal quantity of blood to flow out of the Anaſtomoſis, whereupon being ſhut it grows together. Howbeit in grown perſons, it remains for a ſeaſon open. <hi>Pinaeus</hi> obſerved it thrice, <hi>Riolanus</hi> once, and my ſelf more then once. <hi>Botallus</hi> moſt frequently in Calves, Sows. Dogs of a large ſize, and therefore he would have it to be alwaies and naturally open, that blood might paſs this way out of the right to the left Ventricle. <hi>Caecilius Folius</hi> treading in his Foot-ſteps, thinks it is open in all Men, to the ſame end, as in a Child in the Womb, but contrary to experience. For it is then only open, when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſhut up other paſſages, as I ſaw at <hi>Padua</hi> in that old Man, whoſe Arteria venoſa was ſtopped with Flegm. In Water-fowl and other Animals that live in the Water, as Ducks, Caſtors, Swans, Bitturns, &amp;c. it is alwaies open, becauſe they live now and then in the Water, without the Uſe of their Lungs. And I have ſomtimes obſerved in dead bodies the little Membrane winking, and receiving the Probe without any violence, but I cannot allow that it is ſo alwaies. And that light opening would be unprofitable. For the paſſage of ſo much blood.</p>
               <p>Another Union is by a longiſh Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,<note place="margin">By a Chanel or Pipe.</note> viz. that of the vena Arterialis, and the Arteria Magna, becauſe they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant one from another.</p>
               <p>This Union is without the Heart (the other within the ſame) two Fingers from the Baſis, in grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons four, for the Channel doth not begin from the ſtock of the Arteria Magna. It goes obliquely to the Arterioſa (therefore no valve is annexed to it becauſe the crookedneſs was able to hinder the Egreſs) [or rather becauſe the blood is forced thither, from the right ventricle of the Heart through the vena Arterioſa but it is not in like manner driven back out of the left, <figure>

               <p>In Infants of three or four years old, it is ſtil to be ſeen, but without any through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſage:<note place="margin">Which is dried up.</note> in grown perſons tis by little and little attenuated and dried, being diſtitute of all Nutriment, becauſe no Humors paſs any longer through the ſame, until through abſence of Life and Nouriſhment, it Putrifies and Conſumes quite away.</p>
               <p>The <hi>uſe</hi> thereof is, I. According to the Mind of <hi>Galen,</hi> that the vital Spirit being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived<note place="margin">Its uſe.</note> from the Navil-Arteries into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Magna, may from hence be carried, through that Channel into the vena Arterioſa and ſo ſtraight into the Lungs, to maintain Life. But, 1. It ſerves not the Lungs alone. 2. The Navil-Arteries do bring out of the Arteria Magna, but carry nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into. 3. The Pipe is greater then to ſerve only to carry Spirits. 4. The Lungs of a Child in the Womb being red, are not nouriſhed only with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>II. According to <hi>Petrejus</hi> and <hi>Hofmannus,</hi> to bring Arterial blood to nouriſh the Lungs. Who had ſaid well, if they had not omitted the good of the whole body.</p>
               <p>III. According to late Writers, that the blood which ſlides out of the upper Trunk of Cava into the right ventricle may paſs through this Pipe, the greateſt part thereof indeed to the Aorta, that ſo with the reſt it may nouriſh and enliven the whole body of the Embryo; but the leaſt portion of all goes up to the Lungs by the ordinary way.</p>
               <p>Both the ventricles in the Child perform one and the ſame thing, and part the blood which is to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, becauſe the more perfect blood is ſupplied by the Mother, and therefore the Walls are a like thick. And the two ventricles in the Child which doth not reſpire, perform the ſame, which in imperfect Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals void of Lungs, is accompliſhed by one ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
               <p>This Pipe therefore aſſiſts the Anaſtomoſis in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the blood of the Heart, becauſe either of the waies would otherwiſe be two narrow. For I have obſerved in a Girle new Borne, by me publickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected, that the Pipe was wanting, becauſe the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomoſis was larger then ordinary: and there is reaſon for it. The Lungs muſt be nouriſhed and the whole body muſt be nouriſhed. Which can never be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs the Arterial Blood be diſtributed out of the Aorta. It comes not from the Mother through the Iliack Arteries, becauſe they are not joyned to the Arteries of the Womb, beſides their motion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as the binding of the Navil Arteries doth ſhew. For the Navil-Arteries derived from the Child, do ſwel towards the Heart thereof, and towards the Placenta or Womb-cake they are empty; for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial blood in the Child<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after it is nouriſhed, runs back through the Iliack veins to the Placenta, as a part of the Child which muſt be nouriſhed, out of which it paſſes again into the Navil-veins, and is mixed with that other blood which comes out of the veins of the Womb, and runs joyntly back again to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Heart of the Child, that the Circulation may be repeated. Now it flows conveniently out of this vena Arterioſa through the Pipe or Channel into the Aorta, by reaſon of its Situation downwards, and its crooked inſertion into the Aorta. Therefore ſeeing the Arterial blood, is not carried fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But after the Birth, becauſe it begins to be moved with the Heart, by heat and motion the Heart becomes light and ſoft, lax, rare and ſpungy; ſo that the Lungs will be eaſily raiſed and fall again, and eaſily receive the Air: Which may be ſeen by the uſe of a Pare of bellows in dead bodies. <hi>Helmont</hi> hath ſeen the Lungs hard and ſtoney, in an Aſthmatical perſon, and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth</hi> obſerves that little ſtones have been there gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in ſhortneſs of Breath.

               <p>The Lungs are compaſſed with a thin light Membrane, furniſht with many<note place="margin">Membrane.</note> Pores which Pores are ſufficiently viſible, when the Lungs are blown up with a pair of bellows, and <hi>Job.

This Membrane is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the encompaſſing Pleura. For when the Veſſels enter into the Lungs, they deveſt themſelves of their Coat, which grows out of the Pleura, which doth afterwards inveſt the Lungs.</p>

This paſſage is proved.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By the greatneſs of the veſſels. For the vena arterioſa and the arteria venoſa are moſt large. And becauſe the former is a veſſel which carries out of the Heart, it is furniſhed with the Mitre-faſhion'd valves, which hinder the blood from paſſing out of the Lungs the ſame way; and the latter bringing blood out of the Lungs into the Heart, has the treble-pointed valves, hindring the blood from returning.</item>
                  <item>2. Great Quantity of Blood is continually ſent by the Pulſe of the Heart, through the vena arterioſa and thence through the arteria venoſa unto the left ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, which is further confirmed by Ocular Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</item>

                  <item>4. The left Ventricle of the Heart being wounded, or the Arteria aorta, great plenty of blood will iſſue, as long as life remains, till all the blood in the body be run out. And from what other place can it come, ſeeing ſo much is not contained in the Heart, but out of the Lungs through the Arteria venoſa, which had drawn the Blood out of the Vena arterioſa by the Anaſtomoſes.</item>
                  <item>5. In the Arteria venoſa as well of a living as a dead Body, ſo much Blood is found, that it hath often hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred me in my publick Diſſections.</item>

By the Situation of the veſſels of the Lungs. The Vena arterioſa is Diſſeminated in the hinder or Convex part of the Lungs, becauſe it is ſtrongly moved by the Pulſe of the Heart, the Arteria venoſa doth cheifly poſſeſs the foremore and hollow part, that the Blood might more readily ſlide into the Heart. In the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of which the Branches of the Wind-pipe are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that in the blowing out of the Air, they might receive ſooty Exhalations from the Vena arterioſa, and in drawing the Air in, they might communicate the ſame to the Arteria venoſa. 3. The anaſtomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by which the veſſels are joyned together, both the branches which joyn mouth to mouth (though in dead bodies they cannot be diſcerned by the Eye-ſight) and the Pores of the Parenchyma which is light and Porous.</p>
               <p>It is to be noted for the anſwering<note place="margin">Contrary objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons anſwered.</note> the objections made againſt this Circulation.</p>
               <p>1. That the Lungs are not oppreſſed or burthened ſo long as they being ſound, the Blood perpetually glides through by Peice-meal.</p>
               <p>2. That the blood doth not drop out through the Pipes of the Weſand, becauſe partly they draw in on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Air or ſooty Exhalations, and in no wiſe Blood of a thicker nature then they, unleſs they be preternatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fretted in perſons that have the Conſumption, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe nature never ceaſes to drive found humors through the paſſages ordained for them, and retains what is neceſſary, which would otherwiſe go out at the paſſages of the Body being opened.</p>
               <p>3. Although the Lungs of Dead bodies are whitiſh, yet the veſſels do manifeſtly tranſpire through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Coat. The Parenchyma it ſelf is frequently ful, in perſons ſtrangled with blood, in others it is found emptied, becauſe in the Pangs of Death it is forcibly excluded.</p>
               <p>4. In burning Feavers, both the Lungs are hot, and thereupon the voice is Hoarſe and dry, and they are oppreſſed, as appeared in the Epidemical Feaver
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41352:63"/>
which raged up and down this year, by which many were ſtrangled.</p>
               <p>5. It is no good judging of the healthy ſtate of the Body, from the preternatural ſtate thereof.</p>
               <p>Very ſmal <hi>Nervulets</hi> from the ſixth Pare are ſpred only through the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane<note place="margin">Why Ulcers of the Lungs are without pain.</note> thereof (which if it be inflamed, a pain will be felt, and communicated to the ſide it ſelf and to the Back) not through the ſubſtance of the Lungs, leaſt by Reaſon of their continual motion they ſhould be pained. Hence the Ulcers of the Lungs are without pain. Howbeit <hi>Riolanus</hi> allots very many Nerves to the ſubſtance of the Lungs alſo, drawn from the Implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Contexture of the Stomach Nerves. I alſo have ſeen many ſpred abroad within the Lungs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the ſixt Pare, and alwaies in a manner accompanying the Bronchia or Lung-pipes, derived from the hinder part, and only a little twig conveig'd to the Membrane from the forepart.</p>
               <p>What the <hi>Action</hi> of the Lungs is, Authors Queſtion. That they never move at all is <hi>Helmonts</hi> Paradox, but ſerve only as a ſeive, that the Air may paſs pure into the Cheſt, and that the Muſcles of the Belly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one do ſuffice for Reſpiration. But that they are indeed and in truth<note place="margin">Whence the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lungs proceeds.</note> moved, the cutting up of live bodies ſhews, and Wounds of the Cheſt, that they move long and ſtrongly. Moreover that they may be moved, any one may try with a pair of Bellows. Finally, They ought to be moved, for otherwiſe both the Heart would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and the motion of the blood in the Lungs, would be hindred. The Muſcles of the Belly do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed concur, but ſecondarily, becauſe they are not joyned to the Heart, and when they are moved Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration may be ſtopped, Yea, and when they are cut off in a living Anatomy, the Lungs are moved nevertheleſs. But whether they are moved by their own proper force, or by ſome other thing, is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queſtion. <hi>Averrhoes</hi> who is followed among the late writers by <hi>John Daniel Horſtius,</hi> conceives the Lungs are moved by their own proper force, not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the motion of the Cheſt, for otherwiſe ſaies he we muſt grant that a violent motion may be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
               <p>But we are to hold, that though the Lungs are the Veſſel of Reſpiration, yet they are ſo not by doing, but by ſuffering. For they have no motive force of their own, as <hi>Averrhoes</hi> will have it (becauſe at our pleaſure we can ſtop our breathing, or quicken or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the ſame) nor do they receive the principle of their motion from the Heart, or from the blood rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, as <hi>Ariſtole</hi> conceives, and his followers, For 1. The efflux of the blood<note place="margin">Ariſtotles <hi>Error.</hi>
                  </note> out of the Heart, is made by the orni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary motion, but the Reſpiration is voluntary. 2. The Cauſe of the Pulſe and Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be one and the ſame, and they would be performed at one and the ſame time. But thirty Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes anſwer one Reſpiration. 3. While we draw in our Breath ſtrongly, and hold the air drawn in for a ſeaſon, the ſwelling of the Lungs ſhould compel us to let our breath go, becauſe it lifts up the Cheſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their opinion. 4. The Blood of the Heart doth not abide in the Lungs by an unequal retention, ſo as to diſtend them, but it is forthwith expelled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature. 5. When it tarries longeſt in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed Lungs, it makes ſhortneſs of Breath or difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in breathing, but no Tumor. 6. In a ſtrong Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, the motion of the Lungs ceaſes, the Pulſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſafe and the Heart unhurt.</p>

                  </note> air forced in, which when the Cheſt is lifted up, becauſe it hath no other ſpace whither it can go to, it is carried through the Aſpera arteria or Weſand into the Lungs, as <hi>Falcoburgius</hi> and <hi>Des Cartes</hi> conceive, and <hi>Hogelan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, Regius,</hi> and <hi>Prataeus</hi> who follow him: For 1. The air may eaſily be condenſed, as may be proved by a thouſand experiments, as by Cupping-glaſſes, Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-glaſſes, Whips, Trumpets, Winds and infinite things beſide; and therefore it may be moſt ſtraitly compacted about the Cheſt, and compreſſed within it ſelf, as well by the internal ſubtile nature of the air and diſperſed by Atomes, eaſily recollected one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in another, as by the external impulſe of the Cheſt, whereby it may more eaſily be condenſed, then driven into another place. 2, By the motion of the Cheſt or ſuch a like body, we do not ſee the lighteſt thing that is, Agitated. By an hole in a Wall all Chinks and Dores being cloſely ſtopped, our Noſtrils being ſtopped, we may with our Mouthes draw air out of the next Chamber, to which it is not credible that the air moved by the Cheſt, can reach with a ſtrong mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and though air may penetrate into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, through ſome chinks and Rifts, yet is it not in ſo great quantity, as to ſtretch the Cheſt ſo much as it ought to be ſtretched, in free Reſpiration. The ſame experiment may be made in a Glaſs or Silver veſſel applied cloſe to ones Mouth. 4. While I have held my Breath, I have obſerved my Belly to be moved above twenty times the while. But whether is the Air then driven? Muſt it not needs be, becauſe all places are ful of bodies, that the air next the Belly is compreſſed and condenſed? See more of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in my <hi>Vindiciae Anatomicae,</hi> and in a peculiar <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the Lungs do only follow the motion of the Cheſt to avoid <hi>Vacuum:</hi> And therefore only they receive the air drawn in, becauſe the Cheſt by wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it ſelf, fils the Lungs with air.</p>
               <p>Now that the Motion of the Lungs<note place="margin">The motion of the Lungs is proved to ariſe from the Cheſt.</note> ariſes from the Cheſt experience ſhews. For 1. If air enter into the Cheſt, being peirced through with a Wound, the Lungs remain immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe they cannot follow the widening of the Cheſt, the air inſinuating it ſelf through the wound, into the empty ſpace. But the Cheſt being ſound, the Lungs follow the widening thereof, to avoid Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum; as in Pipes, Water is drawn upwards, and Quittor, Bullets, Darts and other hard things are drawn out of body through the avoidance of Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. 2. If the Midriff of a live Creature be peirced through with a light wound, Reſpiration is ſtopped, the Cheſt falling in.</p>
               <p>But ſomwhat there is which hinders<note place="margin">An Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in live Anatomies.</note> many worthy men from aſſenting to this cauſe of the Lungs motion, becauſe after the Cheſt is perfectly opened, the Lungs are oftentimes moved along time, with a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment motion. But according to the Obſervation of <hi>Johannes Walaeus, Franciſcus Sylvius,</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus Vander Shagen,</hi> that is not the motion of Conſtriction and Dilatation, which is the natural motion of the Lungs; but it is the motion of an whole Lobe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and downwards, which motion happens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lungs are faſten'd to the Mediaſtinum, the Mediaſtinum to the Midriff, and the Lungs are alſo
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41352:63"/>
ſeated near the Midriff: whence it happens, while the Creature continues yet ſtrong, that either the Lungs with the Mediaſtinum are drawn, or by the Midriff driven, the Diaphragma or Midriff, not yet falling down nor looſing its motion, which I obſerve in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the moſt learned Son of <hi>Horſtius.</hi> Now that this motion proceeds not from the inbred force of the Lungs, doth hence appear, in that alwaies when the Cheſt is depreſſed, the Lungs are lifted up, being forced by the Midriff, which at that time riſes a good height into the Cheſt; and contrarywiſe the Cheſt being lifted up, the Lungs are depreſſed. And becauſe the Lungs are the Inſtrument of Reſpiration, Hence it hath theſe following,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſes,</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. According to <hi>Plato, Galen,</hi> and <hi>Abenſinae,</hi> to be a ſoft Pillow and Cuſhion<note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note> under the Heart.</item>
                  <item>II. According to others who follow <hi>Columbus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> to prepare and wellnigh generate the vital Spirits (which are afterwards to receive their perfection in the heart) whiles in them the blood is as it were Circulated, firſt boyling with the heat of the Heart, and afterwards ſettled by the coldneſs of the air.</item>
                  <item>III. It hath more proper uſes when it is Dilated, and when it is contracted.</item>
               </list>
               <p>When the Lungs are Dilated, they receive in the Air like a pair of Bellows through the Branches of the Wind-pipe.</p>
               <p>I. To prepare Aire for the Heart, for the convenient nouriſhment of the<note place="margin">All kind of Air is not a friend to mans Spirit.</note> lightful Spirit. For every quality of the Aire is not a friend to our Spirit, as is ſeen in ſuch, as are kild with the ſmoak of Charcole, and the ſteam of newly whited Walls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helmont</hi> conceives that the Air is united to the ſpirit of the Heart, and that it receives a fermentation in the Heart, which accompanying the ſame they do both diſpoſe the Blood to a total tranſpiration of it ſelf, which is the reaſon why in the extremity of cold wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and at Sea, we eat more heartily, becauſe the thinneſs of the Air diſpoſes the blood to inſenſible tranſpiration. <hi>Backius</hi> is ſomwhat of the ſame mind, who conceives that by the moiſt and thin body of the Air, the blood is made apt to run, ſo as that it may be diffuſed into the ſmalleſt paſſages of the Body. Others aſcribe both theſe effects to the abundance of Seroſity in the Blood. Therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaies that water is hungry; and we ſee that ſuch as are given to drink, are enclined to ſweat much, as alſo Scorbutick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>II. To fan and cool the heat. For we ſee that the heat of our Bodies ſtands in<note place="margin">Our heat doth want a Cooler.</note> need of ſomwhat that is cold, without which it is extinguiſhed, as is apparent in ſuch as ſtay long in very hot Baths, as the flame of a Candle in a cloſe place, wanting Air goes out. And<note place="margin">Why Fiſhes need no Lungs.</note> therefore the Lungs are called the Fan and cooler of the Heart, and the Fiſhes in the Water and other Animals that have but on Ventricle in their Hearts, are without Lungs, becauſe they do not want ſuch a cooling. As alſo Infants in the<note place="margin">The Lungs of Children in the Womb move not.</note> Womb, being fanned by their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the wide Anaſtomoſes, have their Lungs without motion. Hence it is that having ſeen only the Lungs, you may judg how hot any Creature is; for Nature makes the Lungs the larger, by how much the Heart is hotter. Therefore the Lungs are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Life, but ſerve to accommodate the Heart. For inſtead of Lungs a boy of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> four years old, had a little Bladder ful of a Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous wind, as <hi>Nicolas Fontanus</hi> a Phyſitian of that Citty doth teſtifie, which being guarded with very ſmal Veins, had its original from the Aſpera Arteria or Weſand it ſelf, whoſe office it is to cool the Heart. Who nevertheleſs died of a Conſumption, becauſe haply, his Heart was not furniſhed with a ſufficient quantity of Air.</p>
               <p>When the Lungs are contracted in Expiration, they do again afford us a twofold uſe. I. Sooty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements do paſs away through the ſame, being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of the Heart with the blood, through the Vena Arterioſa. II. To make an articulate voice in Men, and an inarticulate ſound in Beaſts, by affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Air to frame the voice. And therefore Creatures that have no Lungs, are mute, according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle.</hi>

For that ſome part of the drink doth paſs even into the Wind-pipe and<note place="margin">Whether any part of our drink doth paſs into the Weſand and Lungs.</note> Lungs, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth rightly prove by an Hog new kild, in whoſe Lungs matter is found juſt ſo colored as the the drink was, which he drunk imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before he was killed. And that ſome drink may be carried through the Wind-pipe, may be proved out of <hi>Julius Jaſolinus</hi> an Anatomiſt of Naples, who ſeeking in the body of a Noble perſon, the Cauſe of his death, found his Pericardium or Heart-bag, ſo diſtended with Humor, that it being ſqueezed, ſome of the ſaid Humor came out at his mouth.</p>

But the branches thereof which are greater then the reſt of the Veſſels of the Lungs, entring into the Lungs, do go through the middle thereof, between the Vena Arterioſa which is hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and the Arteria venoſa which is before it: with which it is joyned by obſcure Anaſtomoſes, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of Mouths, hardly diſcernable by our Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight.</p>

manner. Yet we muſt note that it is different in a Swan, and after a manner altogether ſingular. For being longer, it inſinuates it ſelf by a crooked win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into a caſe of the Breaſt-bone, and ſoon after from the bottom of the caſe, it returns upwards, and having mounted the Channel-bones, it bends it ſelf towards the Cheſt. But before it reaches the Lungs, tis propped by a certain boney Pipe, broad above, narrow beneath, which in a Duck is round, then it is divided into two branches, which ſwel in the middle, but grow ſmaller where they tend to the Lungs, till they enter into them.</p>

For which intent the mouths of the Vena arterioſa do ſo artificially joyn with the Mouths of the Aſpera arteria, that there is paſſage only for ſooty ſteams but not for blood, unleſs it come away by force and violent Coughing. In the next place, that it may help to form the voice, which it doth by expiration likewiſe, though ſome Juglers frame their Voice by inſpiration only or drawing in of their Breath. And therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls it the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and vocal Organ. A wonder therefore it is that ſome Men can live long in the Water like Fiſhes, by Nature and not by Art, if <hi>Cardan</hi> is to be believed in the ſecond Book <hi>de Subtilitate,</hi> when he makes relation of one <hi>Calanus</hi> a Diver in <hi>Sicily,</hi> who would lie three or four hours under the Water. And how in the <hi>Weſt-indies</hi> everywhere, ſuch as dive for Pearl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oyſters, will lie an hour together under the Water. If they did this by ſome art, it were not ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. So the Aegyptians are moſt perfect divers, and exerciſe Robberies that way. For as appears by the Deſcription of <hi>Nicolus Chriſtophori Radzivilij</hi> his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> they lie lurking under the Waters, and not being content to ſteal on land, what ever they can catch they draw into the water, and carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: and frequently they catch a man as he lies upon a Ships deck draw him under the water and kill and ſtrip him of his cloathes: So that ſuch as ſail are ſaid many times to watch all night armed, And in the ſame parts, aboundance of fiſher men will dive under the water and catch fiſh with their hands, and they will come up with a fiſh in cach Hand and a third in their mouths. Theſe perſons doubtleſs, do either live only by Tranſpiration, as ſuch do that have fits of the Apoplexy and the Mother; or they have Anaſtomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes open in their Hearts, by means of which as in the Womb, the blood is freely moved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lungs.</p>

               <p>THe Head or beginning of this<note place="margin">The Larynx.</note> Lung-Pipe, is termed LARYNX, which is the voices Organ.</p>
               <p>Tis <hi>Situate</hi> in the Neck, and that in<note place="margin">Its Situation.</note> the middle thereof, for it is</p>
               <p>In <hi>Number</hi> one, that there may be only<note place="margin">Number.</note> one voice.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is round and almoſt circular;<note place="margin">Shape.</note> becauſe it was to be hollow for the voices ſake; but on the foreſide it is more Extuberant, on the hinder ſide depreſſed, that it may give way to the Gullet, eſpecially in the time of ſwallowing, in which while the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> is depreſſed, the <hi>Larynx</hi> runs back upwards, and ſo aſſiſts the ſwallowing, both by giving way and bearing down that which is to be ſwallowed.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Magnitude</hi> varies according to<note place="margin">Magnitude.</note> the Ages of perſons. For in younger perſons the Larynx is ſtrait which<note place="margin">How the voice becomes ſhril, or big?</note> makes their voice ſhril: in grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons tis wider, and therefore their voice is bigger. To which alſo the length or ſhortneſs of the Larynx doth contribute: and if plenty of Air or Spirit be drawn and expelled, the Voice becomes big; if little, it becomes ſmal.</p>
               <p>And therefore according to <hi>Galen</hi> there are two cauſes of a great Voice:<note place="margin">What the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are of a great Voice?</note> the Largeneſs of the Aſpera arteria, and the ſtrong blowing out of the air, and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaies both theſe are cauſed by great hear. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">How the Voice comes to change.</note> in his Book of the <hi>Seed,</hi> he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches us that the ſtones do contribute to the formation of the Voice, Hence Males when they grow of ripe years change their voice. A Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Horſe looſes his neighing. A Capon leaves his crowing or crows after a weaker faſhion, different from his former crowing.</p>
               <p>The Parts of the Larynx or about the Larynx: are <hi>Griſtles, Muſcles, Membranes, Veſſels</hi> and <hi>Kernels.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Now the <hi>Muſcles</hi> of a Mans Larynx, are but thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, four common and nine proper: though ſome make twenty, other eighteen, others fourteen.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Common</hi> are thoſe which are implanted into the Larynx, and yet<note place="margin">The Common.</note> do not ariſe therefrom.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Proper</hi> have both their original<note place="margin">The Proper.</note> and termination in the Larynx.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt pair</hi> of the common, called by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Sternothyroides,</hi> being lower more, ariſes within from the Breaſt-bone, its original being broad and fleſhy, and going a long by the Wezand, it is inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beneath into the ſides of the Sheild-faſhion'd Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to ſtraiten the Chink of the Larynx, by drawing down the Scutiformis.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond Pair</hi> called <hi>Hyothyroides,</hi> being the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permore, ariſes from the lower ſide of the <hi>Os hyoides,</hi> being broad and fleſhy, and touches the Scutiformis, being implanted into the Baſis of the ſaid Scutifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to widen the Chink, by lifting up the Scutiformis,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spigelius</hi> and <hi>Veſtingius</hi> aſſign contrary offices to theſe: for they will have the firſt pair to widen and the ſecond to ſtraiten the Chink of the Larynx.</p>
               <p>Others do here add a <hi>third pair,</hi> which <hi>Columbus</hi> nevertheleſs and <hi>Caſſerius</hi> do account but one Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:41352:65"/>But this is rather <hi>Muſculus Deglutitorius,</hi> or a Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing muſcle, becauſe ariſing from the Scutiformis tis wrapped about the Gullet.</p>
               <p>It is judged, by contracting the ſides of the Scuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formis, to ſtraiten the Chink: but it is no Servant to the Larynx unleſs by accident.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt proper Pair,</hi> ariſes on the foreſide, from the loweſt part of the<note place="margin">The Proper.</note> Scutiformis, as the Inſertion of the Nerves doth ſhew, and ends at the <hi>Annularis.</hi> And therefore this pair may be termed <hi>Thyrocricoides;</hi> but not, as moſt Anatomiſts will have it, <hi>Cricothyroides. Some</hi> will have it to ariſe from the fore-ſide of the <hi>Cricoides,</hi> and to end into the loweſt ſide of the Scuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formis. If it be broad and ſpred out ſide-waies, it may be divided into two pair, the <hi>foremore</hi> and the <hi>ſide pair,</hi> and ſo <hi>Riolanus</hi> divides it. But it is for the moſt part ſingle and ſmal enough.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to draw the Cartilago Annularis to the Scutiformis. (lightly, becauſe it is almoſt immoveable) ſo that they may be joyned together, and kept in that poſture. Others who differ about its original, will have it to widen the Chink or the Scutiformis.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond Pair</hi> riſes from the back ſide of the Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris, with a fleſhy orignal, and is implanted into the lower part of the <hi>Glottalis</hi> or <hi>Arytaenoides,</hi> with a Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous end, opening the Larynx, by drawing aſunder the two Griſtles called <hi>Arytaenoides.</hi> And therefore they are called <hi>Par Cricoarythenoides poſticum. Caſſerius</hi> cals them <hi>Par Cucullare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>third pair, Cricoarythenoides laterale,</hi> ariſes above from the ſides of the Annularis, and is inſerted at the ſides of the <hi>Glottalis,</hi> into the joynt, there where it is not touched by the former, and opens the Larynx, with the ſame oblique carriage of the Griſtles.</p>
               <p>The fourth pair, called <hi>Thyroarytenoides,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and very broad, proceeds from the Scutiformis, viz. from its inner and fore part, and from the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coides</hi> likewiſe, as <hi>Riolanus</hi> ſuſpects, and ends into the ſides of the <hi>Glottalis,</hi> or the <hi>Arytaenoides,</hi> which while it contracts and draws to the <hi>Thyroides,</hi> it ſhuts the Larynx, by a ſtraight paſſage. When this pair is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed in a Sq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ie, it makes the Diſeaſe deadly, becauſe it exactly ſhurs the Chink.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ninth Muſcle,</hi> which others term <hi>Quintum par Arytenoides,</hi> ariſes from the hinder line of the <hi>Guttalis,</hi> and being carried along with tranſverſe Fibres, it is inſerted into the ſides thereof, ſhutting the Larynx, while it ſtraitens the Cartilago <hi>Arytaenoides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>it is to be noted,</hi> that all the proper Muſcles of the Larynx, are ordained either to contract or widen the Chink, which that it may be the more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently accompliſhed, ſome of them widen and ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the <hi>Thyroides,</hi> others the <hi>Arytaenoides,</hi> which Griſtles do compaſs the Chink, which being drawn in, or wideneſt, the Chink is withal made narrower or wider. Whence it appears, that I have not unskillfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the Muſcles of the Larynx, as <hi>Riolanus</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braides me.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Epiglottis</hi> in Mankind has no Muſcle; for it is not voluntarily moved in Men, as ſome vainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves; but is only depreſſed by the weight of ſuch things as are ſwallowed.</p>
               <p>But in brute Beaſts, the <hi>Epiglottis</hi> hath Muſcles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are continually eating, and chewing the Cud, and they have a very great <hi>Epiglottis.</hi> And in them ſome Muſcles ariſe from the <hi>Hyoides,</hi> and are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into the Baſis of the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> which they lift up; (and this pair <hi>Veſalius</hi> reckons to be the fift common pair) and others are ſeated between the Coat of the <hi>Epiglottis</hi> and the Cartilage, ſhutting the ſame.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Griſtles</hi> of the Larynx <hi>are five:</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Uſe of the Larynx</hi> is to be the Organ of the Voice.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Remote</hi> are the Cheſt and the Lungs, without the Aſſiſtance of the Heart; for if the four Veſſels of the Heart ſhould be tied, and the Heart cut off, yet a Dog can both run and bark, as beſides later Authors, <hi>Galen</hi> did often experiment: and the illuſtrious Sr. <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> in his Hiſtory of Life and Death, <hi>Article</hi> 15. tels of an unbowelled Man, who after his Heart was taken out, uttered three or four words of his Prayers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Immediate</hi> are either preparatory, as the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea;</hi> or aſſiſtant as the <hi>Muſcles</hi> and <hi>Nerves;</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatory, as the <hi>Mouth</hi> and <hi>Throat.</hi> But the moſt principal part is the <hi>Larynx:</hi> and that part thereof termed <hi>Glottis</hi> is the next and adequate Organ of the Voice.</p>
               <p>Now the Voice is made after this<note place="margin">How the Voice is made?</note> ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But, it is evident, that a Frog hath Lungs, and a Chink in ſtead of a Larynx. And therefore the Voice is an Animal ſound, made by the Glottis through<note place="margin">What is properly a Voice?</note> ſmiting the Air as it is breathed in and out, being produced to ſignifie the Conceptions of the Mind. And therefore Voice is only in living Creatures, nor is every ſound in them a Voice, but that which is made in the Glottis; not Coughing, nor hawking, If any Fiſhes make a noiſe, it is by their Gills or ſome ſuch thing, but not by their Mouths. Creatures without Blood and Inſects, as Bees Waſpes, Locuſts and the like, utter no Voice, but as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> rightly obſerves in his fourth Book <hi>de Hiſtoria Animalium,</hi> they make a noiſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from their Back, as for example ſake, a Graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper makes a noiſe, by rubbing its wings one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another; For in theſe inſects there is contained a certain Spirit and Air, in a Membrane beneath the Septum Tranſverſum. Others will have it that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects make ſuch noiſes by beating the Air after ſundry manners with their wings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Differences of Voices</hi> are infinite,<note place="margin">The differences of Voices, or Speeches.</note> which are made, 1. By the Figurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mouth. 2. By the different Percuſſion and Modulation of the Air, as we ſee in Pipes. 3. From the largeneſs and other qualities of the Inſtruments, viz. the Larynx, Weſand, Lungs and Cheſt. 4. According as the Voice comes to the Ear, intire or mangled. And beſides theſe differences, every particular Beaſt hath a voice of its own, which the Brutes themſelves can accurately diſtinguiſh, having herein a better hearing then Men. For a Lamb newly brought forth, knows its Mothers bleating among a thouſand Sheep, and the Ew likewiſe knows the bleating of her own Lamb from all others. Which is alſo true of Henns and Chickens. For the ſame voice never happens, becauſe the Inſtruments do never agree in all things: even as

               <p>Its <hi>Connexion</hi> is, at the beginning with the Jawes and Larynx, by the Coat of<note place="margin">Connexion.</note> the Mouth, which is common to it and the Stomach.

               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is common with the Stomach. This ſome will have to ariſe from the Ligaments of the Vertebra's, others from the Pleura, who are therein both miſtaken. For it hath its riſe, there where the Membrane of the Stomach ariſes, viz. from the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum, for it is one continued Body with the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the Stomach, it is exceeding thin and in a manner deſtitute of all Fibres.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is the firſt <hi>Proper</hi> one, the external being more fleſhy, thicker and ſofter, then the other; being as it were a Muſcle bored through, being commonly reputed to be interwoven with round and tranſverſe Fibres.

               <p>The third is <hi>Stylopharyngaeus,</hi> which ariſing from the Bodkin-ſhap'd acute proceſs, is ſtretched out to the ſides of Oeſophagus; which both Dilates and Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.</p>

Hereunto the fourth Muſcle is aſſiſtant. For as the firſt being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, embraces the meat which by chewing is brought into a round Maſs, and ſo bears it down: ſo this fourth Muſcle alſo contracting it ſelf, comes out as it were to help, and that the meats received in at the Mouth may not go back, it ſtraitens and repels them on every ſide, and tranſmits them into the Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, ſo that by both theſe Muſcles contracted, and the Semicircular joyned therewith a perfect circle as it were and Sphincter is made, viz. by the fourth in the upper part of the Pharynx, and by the firſt in the lower.</p>

                  <hi>Chap. I.</hi> Of the Hairs.</head>
               <p>IN the Head there is the greateſt plenty of Hair, therefore the Nature of the Hair may conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be delivered in this place: though conſidered as an Excrement, it does not belong to this place.</p>
               <p>Hairs are found well-near in all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<note place="margin">What crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have Hair.</note> that engender their young ones with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their bodies, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> aſſures us: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead whereof Fiſhes have ſcales, Birds feathers, and ſome Beaſts as the Hedg-hog, have long ſharp prickles.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Hairs</hi> are indeed Bodies, but not parts of the body, unleſs in a very large ſignification, as when we ſay ſome parts ſerve only to adorn the body.</p>
               <p>The <hi>immediate material Cauſe</hi> of which the hairs are made, is certain fuliginous and excrementitious Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, thick and earthy, yet ſomwhat glewiſh and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>Its therefore falſe, which ſome affirm,<note place="margin">Whether Hair &amp; Nails grow of good nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that the Hairs and Nails are nouriſhed and generated of good and laudable nutriment. For they grow even in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons conſumed and pined away, and being cut, they grow again in all ages of a mans life; and the oftner they are cut, the ſooner they grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Yea in dead men, as on thieves upon the Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, &amp;c. they grow. See <hi>Paraeus</hi> at the end of his Book, who had an embalmed body in his houſe twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four years together, the Hairs and Nails whereof grew again as often as they cut them. They are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bred of ſooty Steams and Vapors, of the third Concoction, or of the fleſhy ſubſtance it ſelf, by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever heat reſolved into vapors.</p>

               <p>For the <hi>Matter in which,</hi> or the <hi>Place</hi> where hairs are bred, ought not to be too moiſt, nor too dry; as we ſee nothing grow in a wet fuliginous Soyle, nor in ground over dry and parched.</p>
               <p>And therefore the <hi>Skin,</hi> becauſe it is a temperate part, as the place of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Why cruſted Animals have no hairs.</note> of hairs; but if it be too moiſt, or too dry, as in ſome perſons it is, the hair does not ſhoot forth: and therefore cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Animals, as Crabs, Lobſters, Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, &amp;c. have no hairs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Skin</hi> therefore on which hairs muſt be bred, ought to be moderately dry, leaſt the hair ſhould fall from its root; but it muſt not be immoderately, but laxe and rare, leaſt otherwiſe the hair ſhould not make its way through. And therefore hairs may grow all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the skin, becauſe it is every where porous, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Pore hath the root of an hair faſtned therein, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the palmes of the hands and the ſoles of the feet, which parts becauſe of their continual motion and wearing, have no hairs, and becauſe they were to be of an exquiſite ſenſe. And for this cauſe there grows no hair upon a Scar, becauſe it hath no Pores.</p>
               <p>Hairs alſo do ſomtimes grow on the inner Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Body, in the Heart as was ſaid before, in the Womb, in the Urinary paſſages, Witneſs <hi>Hypocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Galen, Schenkius.</hi> Hair was found in the ſtomach by <hi>

               <p>The <hi>Efficient</hi> Cauſe of hair, is not the Soul, nor any vegetative hair-making faculty, but moderate heat, drying up thoſe fuliginous vapors, and thruſting them forth into the pores of the Skin.</p>

                  <item>1. When Matter is wanting.</item>
                  <item>2. When the Skin is Originally too dry, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards grows drier, and is not moiſtened by any neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring part. Now the fore-part of the Head is here to be underſtood, which is commonly the only bald place; for no man, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> becomes bald on the hinder-part of his Head. For either Fat or other moiſture in the hinder-part and the Temples keep them from baldneſs; fat in the fore-part, the Skin becomes dry and hard like a ſhell, and therefore is bald.</item>
                  <item>3. By reaſon of too much or too little heat. For weak heat does not ſufficiently dry the matter, as in cold and moiſt perſons, and ſuch as are in years. And therefore the humor growing over hot by carnal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, is the cauſe of baldneſs, and for this cauſe Boys and Eunuchs do not become bald.</item>
                  <item>4. Alſo four Husbandmen near <hi>Bruxells</hi> became bald by poyſon, as <hi>Franciſcus de Paz</hi> the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Phyſitian obſerved, and wrote thereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Such a poyſon is the fat of a certain Whale in the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of <hi>Feroe,</hi> newly taken out, by which Copper-veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are alſo broken.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Hairs are commonly <hi>divided</hi> into ſuch as are bred in the womb, and ſuch as grow afterwards.</p>
               <p>Thoſe bred in the Womb are three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, thoſe of the Head, of the Eye-lids,<note place="margin">Hairs bred in the womb.</note> and the Eye-brows.</p>
               <p>The Hairs which grow afterwards, are ſuch as ſpring up when a man comes to a juſt age; that is, in a boy when he begins to breed Sperm, and in a Maid when her Courſes break forth, for then the Skin grows open.</p>
               <p>Alſo theſe are threefold: for 1. Hairs breed on the Share, ſeldom in the Womb and the Heart. 2. In the Arm-pits, alſo in the Noſtrils and Ears. 3. On the Chins of men but not of women; for in women their Courſes ſpend the matter of hair which ſhould make a beard, and therefore ſomtimes, when their Courſes are poxt, women have hairs growing on their Chins. It was a rare caſe for a young woman of thirty years of age, one of the Arch-dutches of <hi>Auſtria's</hi> Women, to have ever ſince ſhe was a Girl, before her courſes brake forth, a long beard with muſtachios like a man. And I ſaw ſuch a like Girl not long ſince in the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, who was alſo hairy all her Body over. Lately <hi>Helena Marſwin</hi> in <hi>Fionia,</hi> had a Girl with a long beard of a reddiſh yellow colour.</p>

So in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar thrumming of their hairs, they are defended from the heat. And as a man hath the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Brain of all Creatures, ſo hath he thereon moſt plenty of hairs.</item>
                        <item>2. They moderately heat, as otherwiſe in the Head there is no Fat to keep it warm: but rather a bony ſubſtance, and that far diſtant from the Heart. Now the hairs according to the advice of the Phyſitian, are to be let grow, or to be cut off in this or that perſon, but they muſt not be ſhaven off, becauſe thereby De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions are cauſed. So alſo the beard does cheriſh and moderately warm the Chin. In perſons that are recovering out of ſickneſs, the hair muſt not be cut off, for fear of a relapſe, touching which Queſtion ſee <hi>Sito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Form</hi> of Hairs is not the Soul, as many would have it, becauſe in perſons<note place="margin">Their Form.</note> that conſume, and ſuch as are dead, the hairs grow; and thoſe who conceive with <hi>Plempius,</hi> that there is a Soul in perſons dead twenty four years, I leave the Readers to make an eſtimate of their Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Nor do they retain a vegetative life in dead perſons, for ſo the whole man ſhould not die, nor is there any thing in a dead Carkaſs, that ſhould rather preſerve this life, then the ſenſitive or rational, not to ſay that theſe ignoble Parts by the long-laſting of their lives, ſhould excel all other parts. Plants indeed ſpring living from the lifeleſs Earth, but out of a living Seed, which I deny to be in the Hairs, and therefore they ſtick not in the Body like Plants, nor are bred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Nor muſt we ſay with <hi>Plotinus,</hi> that certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of life remain after death, as warmed rooms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main hot, when the fire is out; for ſuch Reliques of life could not remain ſo many years. The form ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the hairs may be deſcribed by their accidents, which are theſe following.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>Magnitude:</hi> Now the Head-hairs are longeſt, becauſe the Brain is greater<note place="margin">Magnitude.</note> then the reſt of the Kernels: alſo they are thickeſt, becauſe the Skin of the Head is moſt thick, howbeit it is laxe and open, and contains ſufficient moiſture.</p>
               <p>According therefore as the Skin is thick or thin, rare or compact, and the humor plentiful or ſcanty, and the heat weak or ſtrong, the hairs become thick or thin, hard or ſoft, plentiful or ſcanty, &amp;c. He had ſtore of hair on his Head, who could ſuffer himſelf to be ſhot in the head with a bullet, and had no hurt, whom <hi>Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bequius</hi> ſaw in his Voyage to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Yet they grow not infinitely, becauſe the Exhalations are not ſo plentiful, nor does the expulſive Faculty work infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely.</p>
               <p>2. Their <hi>Figure:</hi> The hairs are ſtraight and flat, in ſuch as abound with moiſture, but cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<note place="margin">Figure.</note> in ſuch as are dry. Therefore curled hair is harder then that which lies flat. Hence all Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores are curle-pated, becauſe of their dry Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the Scythians and Thracians have long flat hair, becauſe they are moiſt, according to <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the hairs are ſtraight becauſe of the ſtraightneſs of the paſſages through which they break forth; and criſp becauſe of the crookedneſs of the ſaid paſſages. The augmenting Glaſs informs us that the hairs are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangular; though others will have them to be round becauſe of the roundneſs of the Pores.</p>
               <p>Alſo they are porous or hollow within, as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe <hi>Plica</hi> in <hi>Poland</hi> does ſhew, and the hairs of an Elk. Again becauſe they may be ſplit, they have Pores, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> maxime.</p>
               <p>III. Their <hi>Colour:</hi> which in Brutes follows the colour of the Skin; and in<note place="margin">The cauſe of the colour of the hair.</note> men is exceeding variable, according to the Country, ambient Air predominant Humor, Age, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For thoſe that dwell in hot and dry Countries, have their hair not only dry, criſp and brittle, but alſo black, as the Aegypians, Arabians, Indians; alſo the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Italians, and part of the French have their hair for the moſt part black. They who dwell in cold and moiſt Countries, have their hairs not only ſoft and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aight, but for the moſt part yellow or white, as the Inhabitants of <hi>Denmark, England, Norway, Swedland, Scythia, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again the predominant Humor makes the Colour of the hairs: as in flegmatick perſons, the hairs are for the moſt part white, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Variety of Heat makes variety of Colours: for immoderate heat makes black hairs: for a vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Excrement is raiſed by the heat, and is changed into an exact ſooty ſtream. But temperate heat makes the hairs yellow; more temperate makes them red; a weak heat makes them white. But both theſe cauſes of Colours do eaſily concur in the hair, as when flegm abounds, weakneſs of heat is joyned therewith, and when Blood abounds, heat is moderate, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Alſo a change in the Colour is made in reſpect of Age, as alſo of other accidents. For grown perſons have their hair not only thicker, harder, ſtronger and more plentiful, but at length alſo grey and whiteiſh.</p>
               <p>But no Hairs on the Body of Man are Naturally green, or blew, though there are both green and leek-colour'd Choler in Mans Body; the cauſe whereof is not the thickneſs of the hair, uncapable of light, as <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> imagined, becauſe the hair is capable of being yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, its thickneſs nothing hindring; but, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> rightly philoſophizes, ſeeinge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ry colour is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to every Plant, no more is it to the hairs. Yet I have ſeen green hair'd men at <hi>Hafnia,</hi> and thoſe as work Metals have their hair commonly green. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus Donatus</hi> relates of <hi>Antonius Maria Catabenus,</hi> grey hair'd through Age, how that much Choler mixt with blood abounding in his Body, not only his Skin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of a Verdigreeſe or yellow-green colour, but his grey hairs were alſo died of the ſame hue.</p>
               <p>The Ancients conceived that grey hairs<note place="margin">The cauſe of grey hairs.</note> did proceed from drineſs, as the Leaves of Trees when they are dried, look white.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> confutes them. For thoſe who go with their heads covered, do ſooner grow grey, and yet are not ſo dried, as thoſe that expoſe their heads bare to the air. Again ſome are grey as ſoon as they are born or quickly after, which cannot proceed from Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Now they grow ſooneſt grey that go<note place="margin">Why they are ſooneſt grey-hair'd that go with their Heads co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd?</note> alwaies with their Heads covered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the heat cannot be fanned, but is overwhelmed and ſtrangled, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extinguiſhed, an external heat is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced; ſo that putrefaction is the cauſe of grey hairs, which ſprung from ſcarſity of innate heat, which cannot ſo digeſt the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors as in youth. And the outmoſt and ſmalleſt end of the hair is whiteſt, where there is leaſt heat.</p>
               <p>Now why a white Humor ſhould ariſe from putrefaction, the Cauſe is,<note place="margin">Why Men are ſooneſt grey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their temples?</note> according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> becauſe a great part is turned into Air, which being well mixed with an earthy and warry Subſtance makes whiteneſs.

Add hereunto, that the Bones of the Temples are very thin, and therefore extraneous heat can eaſily paſs through them.</p>

                  <hi>Chap. II</hi> Of the Membranes without and within the Skull.</head>
               <p>THe EXTERNAL MEMBRANES which compaſs the Skull, are two: The PERICRANIUM and the PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIOSTIUM which compaſs the Brain; alſo there are two Meninges or <hi>Matres</hi> ſo called, viz. DURA MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER and PIA MATER, that is to ſay a thick Membrane and a thin one, which perform the ſame Office in their Cavity, which the Pleura performs in the middle Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and the Peritonaeum in the loweſt.</p>
               <p>The PERICRANEUM is a Membrane thin and ſoft, compaſſing the Skull, and<note place="margin">The Pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum.</note> ſpringing from the <hi>dura Mater</hi> coming out at the Sutures of the Skull.</p>
               <p>That it ſprings from the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Conſent between the Brain with its Meninges and the Pericraneum, does ſufficiently prove, which cannot be by any other way more conveniently made forth. Moreover, this production of the Pericrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um from the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> is manifeſtly viſible in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, in whom the Moles of their Heads are not yet ſufficiently cloſed. Thoſe Fibres wherewith <hi>Horſtius, Spigelius,</hi> and <hi>Laurenbergius</hi> do conceive that the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craneum is only faſtned to the <hi>dura Mater,</hi> do not go unto the Throat: for the Bones being by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hardned and compreſſed, that ſame Continuity of the Pericraneum and <hi>dura Mater,</hi> was broken off with Age, from whence aroſe that appearance of Fibres which hath deceived ſome.</p>
               <p>The PERIOSTIUM is a moſt thin and nervous Membrane, and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding<note place="margin">Perioſtium.</note> ſenſible, by help whereof, all the bones ſaving the teeth being compaſſed therewith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſenſible.</p>
               <p>I diſtinguiſh theſe two Membranes with <hi>Veſalius</hi> and <hi>Bauhinus</hi> againſt <hi>Fallopius, Laurentius</hi> and others, who confound them, ſeeing they may be accurately ſeparated by a skilful Anatomiſt.</p>
               <p>Now the various Muſcles about the Head ſhall be explained in their proper place.</p>
               <p>The CRASSA MENINX or harder Membrane called alſo DURA MATER,<note place="margin">Craſſa Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninx.</note> becauſe of its thickneſs and hardneſs, and becauſe many conceive all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Body do ariſe out of this and the <hi>tenuis Membrana</hi> or <hi>pia Mater,</hi> does cover the Skull all over on the inſide, and all its Cavities and hollowneſs; and ſticks ſtrongly to its Baſis, ſo that ſome have thought it took its Original from thence.</p>
               <p>Now it compaſſes the Brain alſo looſely, on the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſide, and covers the inſide of the Skull. (For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Hildanus</hi> and <hi>Varolius</hi> have obſerved that it is ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſtned to the Skull, that was beſides the ordinary Courſe of Nature) that there may be ſome diſtance between, as there is between the Heart and the Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag, both in living and dead bodies, though in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is greater, by reaſon of the defect of Spirits and the falling in of the Brain, which I grant <hi>Olbafius</hi> and <hi>Hofmannus;</hi> and this is ſo contrived that the ſwelling Veſſels of the Brain, may not be compreſſed, and that there may be no hindrance of the</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motion of the Brain,</hi> which is made up of Syſtole and Diaſtole, and is continual,<note place="margin">The Brain moves.</note> as may be ſeen in Wounds of the Head, newborn Children, and moſt vehement pains of the head, as <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> hath obſerved: And I my ſelf have frequently ſeen this motion in wounded perſons. Strange therefore it is that ſome learned men will needs deny this motion. But it is a very hard task to aſſign the true Cauſe of this motion: Some make it to be the Meninges; others the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; others the Subſtance of the Brain. But it is ill aſcribed to the Meninges: for a great portion of the brain being taken away, and the Meninges themſelves, the brain was obſerved to move in a living Sheep, by the <hi>renowned Riolanus.</hi> They judg better who aſcribe the ſame to the Arteries, for the motions of the Brain and Arteries do happen both at one and the ſame time, as may eaſily be obſerved in Fractures of the Skul, and in the Heads of Infants. Yea and <hi>Walaeus</hi> obſerves that in thoſe who being wounded in the Head to the Brain, have extream anguiſh, only certain conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arteries do move, and not the Subſtance of the Brain; and when the parties wounded gather ſtrength, the motion of their Brain evidently returns. Alſo <hi>Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> hath obſerved in living Lambs, Kids and Dogs, that the brain it ſelf hath no motion but only the Arteries. To him <hi>Olbafius</hi> gives conſent, becauſe the motion is moſt obſervable about the Cavities of the dura mater, where are moſt Arteries. And therefore I conceive we muſt not have recourſe to the ſubſtance of the brain: which is alſo ſoft and flaggie, and ſufficiently indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for motion. But the chiefeſt motion is obſerved at the full of the Moon, by reaſon of the working of the humors at that ſeaſon. But that alſo ſprings from the Arteries, which are more diſtended with blood: for the motion of the Heart becomes quicker or ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, according to the various Influence of the Stars. That the motion of the brain ſhould anſwer the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lungs, I have no ſufficient ſign to prove.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>it is faſtned</hi> to the pia mater and the brain, by Veſſels; to the Skul by thin membranous fibres ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it ſelf, paſſing out through the futures, and conſtituting the Pericranium.</p>
               <p>This Meninx or Coat is double, as the reſt of the Membranes are. The external part reſpecting the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, is hard, rough, and of a ſmall ſenſe, becauſe of the hardneſs of the Skull which it was to touch.</p>
               <p>The inner part is ſmooth, ſlippery, brightly ſhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and white, being more drenched with a wateriſh moiſture.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>fourfold</hi> where it diſtinguiſhes the Brain from the petty-brain, in which place Dogs have a bone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derpropping their brain, that it may not bear hard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cerebellum, Branilet, or petty-brain.</p>
               <p>But on the Crown of the Head it is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,<note place="margin">The Sickle.</note> where it divides the brain into the right and left part: and becauſe the Reduplication is in the hinder-part broad, and grows afterwards nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row by degrees, yet not to a point, ſo as to repreſent a Reapers Sickle, therefore<note place="margin">See Tab. 11.</note> they term this Body <hi>Falx</hi> the Sickle. And while it is thus multiplied, it conſtitutes.</p>

                  <hi>Chap. III.</hi> Of the Brain and its Marrow in General.</head>
               <p>WIthin the Skul a threefold ſoft and white ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is to be conſidered: the BRAIN or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Part, the BRAINLET or <hi>Cerebellum</hi> the hindmoſt part, and the inmoſt partwhich lies deep under the Brain being a white MARROW; which becauſe others do ignorantly confound with the Brain it ſelf; I do thus truly ſet down the truth of the matter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Brain</hi> commonly ſo called hath two parts, the one <hi>Internal</hi> the other <hi>External.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>External</hi> part is properly and<note place="margin">What is properly the Brain.</note> ſtricktly called the BRAIN and is all that which appears outwardly ſoft, of an Aſh color or yellowiſh white; which color ſome conceive to ariſe from an innumerable company of Veins there diſſeminated; and this External ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is as it were the bark.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Internal</hi> is the remaining ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance<note place="margin">The Marrow what?</note> which lies hidden beneath the the former, being more hard compact and white, which we may call the MARROW, in which are ſeated the Ventricles commonly ſo called, but not in the Brain it ſelf; ſo that</p>
               <p>The Brain and Marrow it ſelf <hi>Differ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How they differ?</note> 1. In Situation. 2. In Color. 3. In Conſiſtency. 4. By the going between of Lines. 5. In Magnitude. 6. In Figure. 7. In Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, which are in the Marrow, not in the Brain. 8. In Nobility.</p>
               <p>The white part therefore of the Brain ſeems to be buryed in the Aſh-color'd part, as the Chryſtalline Humor is in the Glaſſie. And though theſe two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the White and the Aſh-color'd, do in dead Carcaſſes putrified ſeem very cloſely united and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued one to another; yet in the freſh bodies of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons ſuddenly killed, they are ſeparated with ſundry lines, ſo that they may be very well actually ſevered, if great Dexterity be uſed, and Diſſection be begun preſently after the parties death, otherwiſe they are overflowed with much moiſture and fall in.</p>
               <p>This middlemoſt white ſubſtance or<note place="margin">Parts of the Marrow.</note> 
                  <hi>Marrow, I divide into the round</hi> and <hi>long Parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Globous</hi> or <hi>round part,</hi> which I<note place="margin">The Head of the Marrow, what?</note> ſhall call the Head of the Marrow, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the Figure of the Skul, and is of great bulk, having in it three Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Ventricles commonly ſo called.</p>
               <p>The <hi>long</hi> part, which I will call the Tail of the Marrow, ariſes immediately out of the former like a certain Tail, wherein is ingraven the <hi>Calamus Scriptorius</hi> or fourth<note place="margin">A new opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the place where the Animal ſpirits are made.</note> Ventricle ſo called by ſome; wherein I hold the true Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Animal Spirits to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>And this long Portion of the Marrow, is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and original of all Nerves whatſoever that are in that place; contrary to what is commonly thought.</p>
               <p>Alſo this lengthened <hi>Marrow</hi> may be conſidered in a twofold manner: either as it remains ſtill <hi>within the Skul,</hi> and then the Nerves ariſe therefrom, which are vulgarly; attributed to the Brain: or as it is without the Skull, and ſlides into the Back-bone, gaining the title of the Spinal Marrow.</p>
               <p>But that young Learners may not be confounded, I ſhall now propound the ſtructure of the whole Brain commonly ſo called.</p>
               <p>The <hi>greatneſs</hi> of a Mans Brain is<note place="margin">The Magnitude of the Brain.</note> remarkable in proportion to the reſt of his body, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves. And for the moſt part a man hath twice as much

Brain as an Ox, viz. the quantity of four or five pound weight, becauſe he is a more noble Creature, and perpaps becauſe he goes bolt upright: for when when we would have any thing that is moveable to ſtand upright we put a great weight on the top, to prevent its falling. Yet the ſcull of a monſtrous beaſt lately found in <hi>Scania,</hi> might preternaturally contain twice that quantity of Brain. The Skull it ſelf is kept in the ſtudy of <hi>Wormius.</hi> And among Man-kind, Men have<note place="margin">Who have moſt Brains.</note> more Brains then women. For to them the greateſt brain is given, that have moſt need of brains, and greateſt uſe of them, for the exerciſe of ſundry excellent Animal faculties. Yet <hi>Spigelius</hi> or <hi>Bucretius</hi> will not allow of this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the brains of the two Sexes, moved doubtleſs by Ocular Inſpection, and the great Minds and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of ſome Women, which the foregoing Age and this of ours have brought forth. But Women are therefore ſaid to have leſs brains then men, becauſe for the moſt part they have leſs bodies.</p>

               <p>The windings of the brain (which I firſt learnt of <hi>Fr. Sylvius</hi> a great Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt)<note place="margin">The winding Clift of the Brain</note> if you diligently examin the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you ſhall find to deſcend a good depth, &amp; that the brain doth gape on each ſide, over &amp; above that ſame middle diviſion made by the Sickle, with a winding clift, which begins in the forepart, about the roots of the Eyes,<note place="margin">See <hi>Tab.</hi> 3.</note> whence according to the bones of the Temples, it goes back above the Root of the ſpinal Marrow, and divides the upper part of the brain from the lower part. Yet now and then, that ſame great Chink cannot be found or very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Inſtead thereof I have found a certain ſmal late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral clift on each ſide eaſily ſeparable, even in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſection, near the Ventricles, ful of the Carotick Arteries.</p>
               <p>The <hi>inner</hi> Surface hath ſundry Extuberances and Cavities, as ſhall be ſaid in the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:41352:71"/>The <hi>Colour</hi> is white, becauſe the brain, as all other parts hath its original from<note place="margin">The Colour.</note> the Seed, but ſo, that it hath leſs of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification then of Conſtitution: and therefore in extream faſtings the brain ſuffers no diminution.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Temperament</hi> is cold and moiſt, which appears from its whiteneſs and<note place="margin">Its temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</note> moiſtneſs. And therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaies the brain is the ſeat of cold and clammy humors. For the overgreat heat of the brain is an hinderance both to Reaſon and Sleep, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Phrenetick perſons. Yet is it by reaſon of the ſpirits hotter then any Air, as <hi>Galen</hi> rightly ſaies; yet is it not ſo exceeding hot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Heart</p>
               <p>Its ſubſtance is proper to it ſelf, ſuch as is not in the whole body beſides.<note place="margin">Why the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the brain is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately ſoft?</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth liken it to a Kernel, by reaſon of the Colour and plenty of moiſture. It is ſoft and moiſt for the more eaſie impreſſion of Images and Conceptions, for it is the ſeat of Imagination: Yet is it not ſo ſoft as to run about, but hath a conſiſtent ſoftneſs, ſo that what is imprinted therein, may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for a ſeaſon: for the brain is alſo the ſeat of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
               <p>The followers of <hi>Des-cartes</hi> doth weave the brain together of ſoft and pliable Fiberkies, mutually tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching one another, with intermediate ſpaces of the pores, by which Fiberkies the Images of Objects are imprinted upon the brain. They do indeed excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently explain the reaſon of Senſe, if this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of theirs were true. But ſuch Fiberkies are not found in the ſoft ſubſtance of the brain, unleſs we ſhall mean the beginning of the Spinal Marrow, out of which the little Ropes of Nerves do ariſe.</p>
               <p>It is a rare caſe for the ſubſtance of the brain to be quite wanting, but <hi>Horſtius</hi> ſaw it ſomtimes much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed by over great uſe of carnal Embracements, as his Epiſtles ſhew. Howbeit <hi>Schenckius, Valleriola, Carpus, &amp;c.</hi> ſaw a Boy without any brain; as alſo <hi>Nicolas Fontanus at Amſterdam</hi> in the year 1629, who inſtead of a brain and ſpinal marrow, found a very clear water encloſed in a Membrane.</p>
               <p>Sundry Veſſels are Diſſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the brain. For if you<note place="margin">There are Veins in the Brain.</note> ſqueeze the ſubſtance thereof, many little Dripplekies of blood do ſweat out: and therefore I conclude with <hi>Galen</hi> that very many capillary Veins and Arteries are there diſſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated: which I have alſo divers times beheld with mine Eyes. Which will then principally happen, as <hi>Fr. Silvius</hi> obſerves, when the brain is Flaccid and Friable, becauſe he obſerved that then it would come of it ſelf from the Veſſels, in diſſection; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the Veſſels by means of Age, or any other waies, are become more ſolid then ordinary.</p>
               <p>Now there are no <hi>Nerves</hi> Diſſeminated through the Brain and therefore it is Void of all Senſe.</p>
               <p>The Veins which are carryed through the ſubſtance of the brain are, 1. The five branches of the jugular Veins, ſome of which go into the Cavity of the dura mater, others are ſpred up and down through the Coats and ſubſtance of the brain. But they, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Obſervation of <hi>Walaeus,</hi> are no other then, 2. very ſmal twigs, which on either ſide go into the ſubſtance of the brain, out of the Cavities of dura mater.</p>
               <p>There are four Arteries from the Carotides and Cervicales, whereof the former are diſſeminated into the brain upwards and downwards, the latter into the Brainlet or Cerebellum. In the Chinks the ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotick Arteries are carried in very great number, both in the ſurface and the bottom, which <hi>Fr. Sylvius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to be the cauſe of that ſame troubleſome pulſing about the Temples in ſome kinds of Head-ach: though in the judgment of <hi>A. Kyperus</hi> the pulſation of the external Arteries adds ſomwhat hereunto, as the Cure of the pain doth ſhew, by opening the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe of the Brain</hi> according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Uſe of the Brain.</note> is to cool the Heart, which <hi>Galen</hi> juſtly refutes, becauſe the brain is far from the Heart. But there are ſome Peripatericks who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> diſſents from the Phyſitians, while he ſaith the brain is made to temper the heat of the Heart, and they will have it made to produce Animal ſpirits: In as much as the Animal ſpirits cannot be generated, unleſs the vital Spirits be firſt cooled But,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> thereof is, 1. To be the Manſion of the ſenſitive Soul, for the performance of Animal Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now the brain is no particular Organ of Senſe, as the Eyes, Ears, &amp;c. but an univerſal one: for judgment is made in the brain of the Objects of all the Senſes.</p>
               <p>Alſo it paſſes judgment touching<note place="margin">Of the brains Motion.</note> Animal Motion, whereas it ſelf hath no Animal Motion: But it hath a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Motion, communicated from the Arteries, and that a perpetual one of widening and contracting it ſelf, as appears in Wounds of the Head and new-born Children, in the forepart of whoſe Head, the brain is ſeen to pant, becauſe their bones are as yet exceeding ſoft and plyable.</p>
               <p>In its Dilatation the brain draws vital Spirit with arterial blood out of the Carotick Arteries, and Air by the Noſtrils.</p>
               <p>In its contraction it forces the Animal ſpirits into the Nerves, which like Conduit pipes carry the ſaid Spirit into the whole body, and therewith the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Senſe and Motion. And by the ſame Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the blood is forced out of the Ventricles through the Veins unto the Heart.</p>
               <p>The Matter therefore of the Animal<note place="margin">The Matter of the Animal Spirits.</note> Spirits is two fold; viz. Arterial blood ful of vital Spirit, and Air. Touching the place of its Generation we ſhall ſpeak hereafter. For I am not of their opinion who confirme that this Spirit is Generated in the ſubſtance of the Brain, or in thoſe Ventricles in the forepart thereof.</p>
               <p>2. That the Animal ſpirit may be contained and kept in the brain as in a Store-houſe, after it is gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. And the ſubſtance, truly, of the Brain is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Houſe and Receptacle for the Animal ſpirit, ſeeing it is the ſame with the internal Marrowy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Nerves, which alſo contains the ſaid Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirit.</p>
               <p>Now I am of Opinion that in the<note place="margin">A new opinion of the Author, touching the uſe of the Brain and the Marrow.</note> Brain, properly ſo called, or the Rinde, is contained Animal Spirit for Senſe; and that in the whole Marrow Head and Tail, Spirits is kept for Motion, which ſhall be made manifeſt in the following Chapter.</p>

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:41352:72"/>The <hi>lengthened Marrow</hi> ariſes as ſome conceive from the brain alone, according to others from the Brainlet or Cerebellum. But it hath both (to ſpeak now at a vulgar rate) for its beginning.</p>
               <p>For it ariſes from four Roots or Foundations; two of which are greater from the fore-part of the brain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo called, two are leſſer from the inner part of the Brainlet or petty Brain. From theſe united, the ſpinal Marrow ſeems to be conſtituted. But it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure a more true opinion to think, that thoſe originals are proceſſes of the Marrow it ſelf, as was ſaid before.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Medulla oblongata</hi> or lengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Marrow, is a little harder then that of the brain.</p>
               <p>One part thereof is within the <hi>Skull,</hi> four Fingers breadths above the great Hole of<note place="margin">The ſpinal Marrow divided.</note> the Hind-part of the Head. Another and the longeſt part thereof is <hi>without the Skull</hi> in the Vertebra's, from the firſt of the Neck to the laſt of <hi>Os ſacrum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its Figure is longiſh and round, The Scripture calls it the Silver Cord. In its beginning it is thicker and larger then elſewhere.</p>
               <p>It is further divided into the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>left</hi> part, even as the brain is, by the <hi>pia Mater</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Another diviſion.</note> which immediately inveſts the ſame, which may be ſeen in the Marrow of an Oxe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently boyled. Hence there may be a Palſie of only one ſide of the body.</p>
               <p>Now it is divided into many little Cords as it were, about the ſixt and ſeventh Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra<note place="margin">Another diviſion.</note> of the Cheſt: and if the ſpinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of a body newly dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be preſently plunged in cold water, and a ſeparation of theſe cords made, you may ſee the ſhape of an Horſes tail, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towards the end) divided into many long Hairs: ſo that according to <hi>Laurentius,</hi> the Nerves alſo of the Back and Loyns, do ſpring from the Marrow of the Neck.</p>
               <p>It is covered with a tripple <hi>Membrane,</hi> the firſt which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately<note place="margin">The Coats of the Marrow.</note> covers it, is from the <hi>pia Mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is from the <hi>dura Mater</hi> and cleaves to the former, Which two, according to the Obſervation of <hi>Spigelius,</hi> are not ſeparated any diſtance one from another, as they were within the Skul, but touch one the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> being external ſprings according to <hi>Galen</hi> from a ſtrong Ligament, which binds together the foreparts of the Vertebra's, and in the hinder part ends into a ſtrong Coat, leaſt in bending or extending the Back-bone, the Marrow ſhould be hurt.</p>
               <p>A thick and clammy humor is poured round about this Coat, to moiſten the ſame.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the Marrow is ſhut up in the Vertebrae, leaſt it ſhould be hurt (as the brain is ſhut up in the Skul) ſeeing it is a noble part, and the original of the Nerves. Therefore the Ancients called the Cavity of the <hi>Spina</hi> or Back-bone <hi>Hieran Surigga,</hi> the holy Pipe.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this Marrow, while it is yet in the Skul, there appears ingraven.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Hollow Cavity,</hi> which <hi>Galen</hi> calls the Ventricle of the Brainlet; others<note place="margin">A noble Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle in the Marrow.</note> call it the fourth Ventricle of the brain, though it is not in the brain. But I ſhall term it the <hi>noble Ventricle</hi> of the Marrow. This is moſt ſolid, moſt pure, moſt ſubtile, but leaſt of all, for it containes a matter of geater force and faculty then the reſt, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies.</p>
               <p>And becauſe, after a ſtraight even progreſs, it is widened on each ſide, and ſharpened afterwards into a point, becauſe of this ſhape tis called <hi>Calamus Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius,</hi> the <hi>Writing Pen or Quil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from the Cerebellum or<note place="margin">The cover of the noble Ventricle is from the Brainlet.</note> Brainlet, which is joyned to this Marrow, another and middle half of this Ventricle is conſtituted, as it were a cover; ſo that all this Cavity is between the brainlet and <hi>Medulla oblongata,</hi> or production of the Marrow, but the cheif Cavity is the lowermoſt, which is in the Marrow.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of this Ventricle I hold to<note place="margin">The true place where Animal Spirits are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Author.</note> be this, viz. that it ſhould be the place where Animal ſpirits are Generated and Elaborated. For this Ventricle is 1. The moſt pure and ſubtile. 2. It hath a Cavity ſufficient for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. 3. It is ſeated in ſuch a place, that it can poure forth Animal ſpirits, into all the Nerves round about it. And therefore <hi>Herophilus</hi> did rightly judg, that this was the moſt principal Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle.</p>
               <p>Nor can I deviſe how it came to paſs<note place="margin">A Proof.</note> that certain learned Men could not ſee theſe weighty Arguments, who have written without cauſe, that I aſſigned the Generation of Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to the <hi>Calamus Scriptorius,</hi> without any reaſons moving me thereto.</p>
               <p>Now muſt we think with <hi>Spigelius,</hi> that this Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle did only reſult by conſequence, out of the round particles of the Brain, touching one another without any deſign of Nature: for Nature doth nothing to no end, no not when ſhe ſeems moſt of all to do ſo.</p>
               <p>Others conceive that the Animal Spirit is bred in the fore Ventricles of the Brain.</p>
               <p>But they are full of Excrements, whoſe receptacles they rather are, as appears by the <hi>Glandula Pituitaria</hi> unto them, and in that they are often found filled with Flegm, and abundance of water.</p>
               <p>Others in the <hi>Rete Mirabile,</hi> others<note place="margin">The preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Animal Spirits where it is?</note> in the <hi>Plexus Choroides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in theſe we hold the Animal Spirit is prepared, but not Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, For nature is wont to provide intertwinings of Veſſels for the preparation of any matter: and ſeeing theſe Veſſels are ſo ſmal, how can it be generated in them, eſpecially ſeeing ſo many Excrements of the brain flow through the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p>Others will have them to be wrought in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the brain. Others in the lengthened body of the ſpinal Marrow. But the Generation of ſo ſubtile a Spirit, did require ſome Cavity, which is alſo allowed to the Generation of the vital Spirits.</p>
               <p>For which cauſe ſome have been induced to allot the making of the natural ſpirit to be in the right Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Heart, becauſe there is no Cavity in the Liver.</p>
               <p>I am therefore of opinion that the Animal Spirit is prepared in the <hi>Rete Mirable,</hi> and yet more in the <hi>Plexus Choroides,</hi> and that is generated and wrought up in this Cavity of the <hi>Medulla Elongata,</hi> or in the noble Ventricle; and afterward, as much of it as not derived into the ſpinal Marrow and the Nerves of the brain, is preſerved and retained in the whole brain, as in a Store-houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:41352:73"/>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of the lengthened and ſpinal Marrow, is to be the original of all the<note place="margin">This Marrow the beginning of all Nerves.</note> Nerves. For from that part thereof within the Skull, thoſe Nerves ariſe which are commonly attributed to the Brain, being uſually reckoned to be ſeven pair.

               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of all the Proceſſes is to hinder the noble Ventricle from being obſtructed, by preſſure of the brainlet. <hi>Laurentius</hi> ſaies they help the motion of the Ventricles like a Valve, becauſe the Vermiformis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhortned opens the way, which goes from the third to the fourth Ventricle; when it is extended it ſhuts the Chink, leaſt the Spirits ſhould go back into the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Cavities. <hi>Riolanus</hi> diſſents but little from him, for he will have it to open and ſhut the entrance of the fourth Ventricle. But it is not moved of it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as the brain, ſo is it void of any proper motion, unleſs you aſſign it to the Veſſels or pia Mater, which are very ſmall, or at leaſt to the neighbouring Animal Spirits.</p>
               <p>Now I believe the uſe of the bridg is, to combine and keep in compaſs the Circles of the brain, and as a bulwark to defend the noble Ventricle. And therfore it would more properly be called a Sconce or Fence, then a bridg.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of the brainlet is the ſame with<note place="margin">The Uſe.</note> that of the brain. But <hi>Galen</hi> would have it to be the Original of the hard Nerves; which is falſe. For no Nerves have their Original from it.</p>

               <p>THe precedent parts being conſidered, we muſt come now to thoſe things, which are preſently viſible, about the Conjunction of the Optick Nerves, ſuch as are; the <hi>Rete mirable, Glandula pituitaria,</hi> and the <hi>Infundibulum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Rete mirable</hi> or <hi>wonderful Net,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rete mirabile</note> which ſome call <hi>Plexus retiformis,</hi> is ſo called by reaſon of its artificial and wonderful ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, for it ſhews like many Nets heaped together.

               <p>This Net <hi>lies under</hi> the Baſis of the Brain, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes the Glandula, at the ſides of the Cavity of <hi>Os Sphaenoides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It conſiſts (not of the Nerves of the third Conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as <hi>Volcherus</hi> would have it, but) of the Carotick and Cervical Arteries, carried up from the Heart, to the Baſis of the Brain, which convey blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in to this Net.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of this <hi>Net</hi> is, that therein the blood and vital Spirit may be a very long time detained, that the firſt preparation towards the Generation of Annimal Spirits may there be made.

               <p>Theſe things being thus handled, the <hi>Original of the Nerves</hi> follows in courſe the Section to be obſerved, which every where ariſe from the Marrow; of which I ſhall ſpeak in our Manual of the Nerves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:41352:74"/>The <hi>Ventricles</hi> or <hi>Cavities</hi> of the Brain do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>Theſe according to the common manner of Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beginning from above, are thought to be <hi>three:</hi> two <hi>foremore and uppermore</hi> as they call them, and <hi>one in the middle,</hi> to which ſome add a <hi>fourth,</hi> of which we ſpoke before.</p>
               <p>But if diſſection be made after the new manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from beneath; there appear only two, ſo that the third is common, being a portion of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two.</p>
               <p>I conceive that <hi>there is but one Ventricle of the brain,</hi> which is in the<note place="margin">The Authors opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that there is but one Ventricle of the Brain.</note> middle, but the beginning thereof is divided into two; or there are two proceſſes, which receiving the Excrements, carry them into the middle it ſelf, which they call the third. For there is one continued Cavity of the brain, and the two Ventricles ſo called, do end into a common Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Mean while, becauſe this and that part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſeem diverſly formed, ſome diſtinction may be allowed for Doctrins ſake.</p>
               <p>Thoſe <hi>two Ventricles</hi> which are ill ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>foremore</hi> and <hi>uppermore</hi> (becauſe<note place="margin">The foremore Ventricle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> they conſiſt alſo in the <hi>hinder</hi> and <hi>lower</hi> part of the Brain, perhaps they might better be called the lateral Ventricles, and with <hi>Veſalius</hi> the right and left) are the largeſt of all, crooked, full of windings, Semicircular, and cloathed with the <hi>pia Mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are commonly and not unfitly liken'd to the Moon when ſhe is in the Wane; although they are hardly ever demonſtrated to be ſuch in diſſection. But ſeeing they are both oblong, and very large in their hinder part, they may alſo be likened to Horſe-ſhoes. This round form of the Ventricles was firſt diſcovered by the moſt accurate <hi>Fr. Sylvius,</hi> and after him I have often demonſtrated the ſame. But if you would find the true Figure, you muſt cut the brain deep towards the Skul, or the Temples, on each ſide, becauſe it is deeply ſunk into the <hi>Corpus Calloſum.</hi> For that part of the Ventricles towards the <hi>Septum lucidum</hi> is higher, and that which is towards the lateral part of the Skull is lower. The foremore and deeper parts, are near to the Mammillary proceſſes, and if we believe <hi>Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colhomineus, Bauhinus, Riolanus,</hi> they are in ſome manner tranſpaſſable, eſpecially in elderly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Moreover they run out in their hinder part by a ſtraight Courſe, where they form a Cavity which is ſomwhat round, not unlike the Finger of a Glove; this I remember hath been ſomtimes wanting.</p>
               <p>Moreover it is to be noted, that theſe Ventricles do environ the lateral and hind parts of the Roots of the Spinal Marrow, which alſo, under the <hi>Plexus Choroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> a part of the brain being wreathed and attenuated inwards, and upwards making the Concameration of the Ventricles, doth embrace with a ſelvidge as it were and a Fringe or lace, which the praiſe worthy <hi>Sylvius</hi> wont ſo to call for likeneſs ſake, it being knit to the was foreſaid roots by exceeding thin threds. If gently lifting up the Plexus, you ſhall remove this lace from the Root, you ſhall find little Arteries creeping through the lower ſurface of the Ventricle, continued to the Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-like Coronet of little Arteries inveſting the root; by help of which, this Lace ſeems to ſtick more cloſe to the Root.</p>
               <p>But here you ſhall obſerve, that there is an eaſie outgate for the Humors contained in the ſaid Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which may deſcend down along the ſpinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>They are therefore formed, not in<note place="margin">Corpus Callo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum.</note> the Brain, but in the marrow, where they call it <hi>Corpus Calloſum,</hi> becauſe the ſubſtance is there harder like a <hi>Callus,</hi> where the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles ſeem to reſt upon the two foremore Extuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancies.</p>
               <p>The Conformation of the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles<note place="margin">The Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles of the Brain.</note> of the brain, which all cannot eaſily diſcerne, I have by Anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſpection and the Guidance of <hi>Sylvius,</hi> learnt to be thus.</p>
               <p>Two Roots of the Spinal Morrow do penetrate a good depth into the ſubſtance of the brain; to the upper and former whereof, eſpecially where it looks inward, the brain being continued (now I mean the whiteiſh and Aſh-coloured part by the term Brain) it ſpreads it ſelf every way, eſpecially outwards and backwards and by little and little wreathes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts its lower extremities inward and upwards, till at laſt being attenuated, it doth on all ſides embrace the Root of the ſpinal Marrow with a lace, a little below the place where it ſprings therefrom, as was ſaid before; and ſo forms the lateral Ventricles.</p>
               <p>But in the foremore and inner part, and whiteiſh ſubſtance aſcending from each Root, and making one body cal'd <hi>Corpus Calloſum,</hi> it is carried back; and covering the middle diſtance between the Roots, which is the third Ventricle, and the wide mouths of the lateral Ventricles opened thereinto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> framed by it ſelf, it makes the Fornix, Arch or Vault; and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the hinder and inner part of the Limbus or edge of each Ventricle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Regius</hi> adds many pores in the Ventricles; looking into the Fiberkies of the ſubſtance of the brain, in which the Animal ſpirit is bred. But thoſe pores and Fiberkies are inviſible to the Eyes of Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.</p>
               <p>They are diſtinguiſhed by a looſe and<note place="margin">Septum luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</note> wrinkeld Partition-Skin: which if it be ſtretched out and held againſt the light, it ſhines becauſe of its tranſparency, and is therefore cal'd <hi>Septum lucidum:</hi> which ſome will have to ſpring from a moſt thin portion of the brain it ſelf, others from the <hi>pia Mater</hi> doubled. But the former opinion is truer, which you may perceive, if after the manner of <hi>Sylvius</hi> having removed the brain and ſickle of the other ſide, you ſhall ſearch the Ventricle of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite part, and ſhall lift up that part of the brain which is continued with the <hi>Corpus Calloſum,</hi> at the Orifice of the third ventricle; for then it may eaſily be ſeen, and diſcerned to be a ſmal portion of the brain.</p>
               <p>The lower, whiteiſh part, where the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles<note place="margin">Fornix.</note> are joyned, is termed</p>

               <p>Under the <hi>Fornix</hi> according to the obſervation of <hi>Sylvius</hi> the <hi>Cheroides plexus</hi> of both ſides, is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carryed, tending towards the <hi>Glandula pinealis;</hi> under which <hi>Plexus,</hi> in its upper part, the two Roots of the ſpinal Marrow grow together; ſo that here the <hi>Teſtudo,</hi> is not ſeated immediately under the third ventricle.</p>

               <p>The third Ventricle commonly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note place="margin">The third Ventricle.</note> or the long Chink, is the meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the Ventricles aforeſaid, which is formed in the Centre, as it were of the Marrow of the Brain, by reaſon of the Conjuction of two round Trunks proceeding out of the Brain. It hath in it two paſſages, the firſt foremore, going downwards to the Glandula pituitaria, that it may there void its Excrements: the other is hindermore, cloathed with a Membrane; which hole ſome call <hi>Anus,</hi> the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament; it goes beneath the Buttocks to the noble Ventricle, that the prepared matter of the Animal ſpirits, may paſs into the place and Womb as it were of their Generation.</p>
               <p>This hole is nothing elſe but a ſpace ariſing upon the mutuall contact of the<note place="margin">The Anus, what it is?</note> four Trunks of the ſpinal Marrow,</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Nates</hi> or <hi>Buttocks,</hi> and the <hi>Teſtes</hi> or <hi>Stones</hi> are four Orbicular promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences,<note place="margin">The Nates and Teſtes.</note> which they ſay are in the Brain, which is falf. They call the two porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Roots of the Medulla oblongata, which ariſe from the Brainlet, Nates; and thoſe two little ones of the Roots from the Brain, they call <hi>Teſtes.</hi> And theſe parts are lower, the other upper.</p>
               <p>Theſe differences, as <hi>Fr. Sylvius</hi> notes, between the <hi>Teſtes</hi> and the <hi>Nates,</hi> have place in Brutes rather then in Men; for the Men they are commonly equal, and many times the <hi>Teſtes</hi> are the bigger.</p>
               <p>But it is a trifling peice of buſineſs to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch Names as theſe; as alſo when they<note place="margin">Penis. Vulva.</note> call the <hi>Glandula pinealis, Penis,</hi> and a certain long ditch between the Eminences they term <hi>Vulva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Between the fore-more Ventricles ſo called, and the Seat of the Teſtudo, there<note place="margin">The Plexus Choroidis, what?</note> is, the Plexus Choroidis or Reticularis ſo called, being a contexture of very ſmal Veins and Arteries, ſent partly from the Arteries, partly from the Veſſels of the dura Mater in the fourth Ventricle. There is a glandulous ſubſtance interwoven within this Plexus, and a portion of the pia Mater. The Plexus Choroides being truly glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, does receive a little branch of the Carotick ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which pierces into the lower part of the brain, which ends about the Glandula pinealis, where it bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches up and down through the lower Surface of the Ventricle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> hereof is the ſame with that of the Rete mirabile.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of that hole, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from the middle Ventricle into the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">Glandula pinealis.</note> Ventricle, there is placed a certain <hi>Glandule</hi> or <hi>Kernel,</hi> termed <hi>Pinealia</hi> the Pine-kernel Glandule, becauſe it is faſhioned like the Kernel of a Pine-apple. The Greeks call it <hi>conarion</hi> or <hi>ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is of an hard ſubſtance, of a yellowiſh and ſomtimes dark colour, and is covered with a thin Membrane. In Creatures newly kil'd tis large, in old karcaſſes, being melted it is ſcarce apparent, or is very ſmall, as alſo in men, whoſe brains cannot be opened whil'ſt they are warm. And therefore they ſay it ſpends like Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire expoſed to the air, being alſo partly melted, as Salt is in a moiſt place.</p>
               <p>According to the Obſervation of <hi>Sylvius</hi> a <hi>nervous little ſtring</hi> does faſten this Kernel as it ſtands betwixt the Teſtes.</p>
               <p>Who alſo obſerved more then once certain granes of ſand in this Kernel, and ſomtimes alſo a little ſtone as big as the fourth part of a peaſe, and ſomwhat round.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of this Pine-kernel is like that of other ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, and eſpecially to help the diſtribution of Veſſels through the brain. Some will have it placed like a Valve before the hole which paſſes into the fourth Ventricle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Des Cartes</hi> and his Followers <hi>Meyſſonerius, Regius, Hogelandius,</hi> do conceive that this Kernel being placed in the middle of the Ventricles, which when a man is awake are diſtended with Spirits perpetually, does 1. Receive the motions of all Objects. 2. That the Soul in this part done by theſe motions, does appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all external ſenſible Objects, and all the Ideas proceeding from the five Senſes, as in a Centre, and diſcern the ſame, and does afterward by help thereof ſend Spirits into all parts; as in a ſmal Sphaerical glaſs, all things are received in the ſame order in which they are either in a Field or Chamber.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe <hi>Meyſſonerius</hi> will have it to be of a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Figure,</hi> becauſe Individuals require more ſpace then ſorts or kinds of things. And that theſe Idea's are diverſly moved by the motion of the animal ſpirit, but are alwaies found joyned by the Verb EST, and according to their equality or inequality, truth or falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is compounded, being compared together like two Lines.</p>
               <p>And that for this cauſe Infants do not preſently ſpeak nor reaſon, becauſe the ſlappineſs of their brain gives not paſſage to the Idea's. And that the overgreat and confuſed motion of theſe Idea's in the Pine-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p'd kernel, makes ravenings, as in perſons drunk, phrentick, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But many things there are which will not ſuffer me to embrace this new and witty Opinion. For</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It is too ſmall and obſcure a body, to be able to repreſent clearly the Species of all things.</item>
                  <item>2. The Species of all Senſes do not come hither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Nerves do not touch the Kernel.</item>
                  <item>3. It is placed in the Quarter of Excrements, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are purged out, by the third, and two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Ventricles, where the Species or Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things would be defiled.</item>
                  <item>4. The Species of things are perceived rather there whereto they are carried. But every ſenſory Nerve each in its place carries the Species to the beginning of the ſpinal Marrow, and therefore each in their place are judged and received by the Soul, in the beginning of the ſpinal Marrow. Moreover this Marrow is big enough, globous, hard, and of a brighter colour.</item>
                  <item>5. Several Idea's would be confounded in this little body. The Eye indeed being likewiſe very ſmall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Species or Repreſentations of things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Conſuſion, but they are only the viſible Species; whereas in this Kernel the divers Species of different Senſes are to be received.</item>
                  <item>6. There is hence no open or known paſſage to the Nerves, as from the beginning of the Marrow, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny communion with ſome Nerves of the external ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</item>

               <p>Howbeit in this new Section after<note place="margin">The order of the parts to be ſhewn in the new way of Diſſection.</note> the neck of the funnel is ſhewed with the Glandula: the Marrow being lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up, firſt of all the Nates and the Teſtes are ſeen, and then the hole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the noble Ventricle; afterwards divers Nerves, the, Ventricles of the brain with the hole into the funnel the Corpus calloſum, the Fornix, the Plexus Choroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and the Glandula pinealis.</p>
               <p>But in the old and common way of<note place="margin">The order of the parts in the old Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection.</note> Diſſection, theſe parts of the brain are ſhewed in order: The Corpus calloſum, the Septum tenue, the two Extuberan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, upon which the Ventricles reſt; the two Ventricles, commonly called the foremore; the Fornix, the Plexus Choroidis, the third Ventricle, its two holes, the Glandula pinealis; and the brainlet being a little removed, the Nates and Teſtes the brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, the worm-faſhion'd Proceſſes, the noble Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, the Pelvis, Glandula pituitaria, and Rete mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile.</p>
               <p>But if you will uſe the middle way of Diſſection, familiar to <hi>Fr. Sylvius,</hi> thus<note place="margin">The order in the middle way of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection.</note> you ſhall proceed. Take off the Skull as deep as conveniently you can. Then ſuffering the left ſide of the brain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main untoucht, with its Membrane; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin your Diſſection on the right ſide, firſt of all cutting aſunder and removing the dura Mater; then take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſome particles of the brain with the pia Mater, til you come to the Cavity of the Ventricle, and then follow both its upper and lower paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage with your Diſſection, as you ſee<note place="margin">The Diſſection of the right ſide.</note> it done in the ſecond Table. Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Limbus if you pleaſe, with a blunt probe, from the root of the Spinal Marrow, and ſhew it; though that may be more conveniently done in the oppoſite ſide of the Brain. The greateſt part of the right ſide of the Brain being thus taken away, the upper and lower Cavities of the Sickle are to be ſhewn, as alſo the greater right ſide lateral Cavity, and the oblique deſcend of the upper Cavity thereinto, all which you have expreſſed in the foreſaid Table.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus done, go to the left ſide, and therein firſt cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">The Diſſection of the left ſide.</note> the dura Mater, and remove it with the <hi>Falx</hi> or Sickle; then gently remove the left ſide of the Brain, into the place of the right ſide newly removed; and as you are doing this obſerve from Tab. 3. the Veſſels going into the lateral Cavity, and how they riſe up about the optick nerves, and are diſtributed into very many branches, creeping every where up and down the inner Subſtance of the brain, and eſpecially the winding Surface thereof, til at laſt they end into the Carotick Arteries. Then ſearch out that ſame notable chink or clift, between the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41352:75"/>
which is figured out in the Table aforeſaid; and having cut the pia Mater, open the ſides thereof a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>little with a Spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>er, that the branches of the Caroti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des may better appear, which are carried through the bottom of the turnings, with the Rudiments of new windings. But if, before you ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſhew the brain, you ſhall free the<note place="margin">An excellent Argument for the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood.</note> Carotick Arteries and the jugular Veins from the parts adjacent in the Neck, and bind them diſtinctly; and then by a Wound made in an Artery ſhall put in a crooked hollow probe and blow; the veſſels diſſeminated through the whole brain wil ſwel, as being branches of the Carotick Arteries, until the air with the forced blood ſhall at length empty it ſelf into the Ventricles: if by the foreſaid hollow probe, you ſhall in like manner blow into the Ventricles, you will perceive their continuation and communion with the jugular Veins, by the ſwelling and diſtention of the ſaid Veins; and will acknowledg that the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the blood, is not a little confirmed by this pleaſant Spectacle.</p>
               <p>Hence, returning to a farther ſearch into the fabrick of the brain, and a wary Inciſion being made in the hinder part of the ſide propounded, ſearch there for the larger Cavity of the Ventricle, and follow it with your Diſſection to both the Ends; then turn back every way the outer part of that which is diſſected, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle part being kept upright, which reſts upon the root of the Spinal Marrow, and is continued therewith, which is excellently well expreſſed in Table the ſixt, in the Explication whereof, what you ſee ſet down, weigh in order.</p>
               <p>Finally, taking away the Brain, obſerve again all the Cavities and that more diſtinctly; and then when you have ſeen the third Ventricle, the Funnel, the Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la pituitaria, the pares of Nerves, after the uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; go back again to the Penis, Anus, Teſtes, Nates, &amp;c. and examine the brainlet and its parts.</p>
               <p>Nor will it be unprofitable, as often as a new occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Diſſection is offered, ſo often to change the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in ſome part; for ſo it will come to paſs, that you will alwaies obſerve ſomwhat which was unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, or neglected, or not diſtinctly enough conſidered.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Skin of the Forehead,</hi> becauſe it is moved, therefore it hath Muſcles, which<note place="margin">Its Skin.</note>

Yet I have obſerved in a large noſed perſon, that an Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix of the ſaid Muſcles did reach to the Griſtles of the Noſe.</p>
               <p>They have ſtraight <hi>Fibres.</hi> Surgeons therefore muſt not cut them athwart, leaſt they deſtroy the lifting up of the Eye-brows; but upwards, according to their length. <hi>Hoſman</hi> after <hi>Aquapendent</hi> ſtands for oblique fibres, on the right ſide from the right hand to the left, on the left ſide from the left hand to the right.

But in an Oxe there is moreover a moveable Membrane, which can ſhut the Eye, though the Eye-lid be open, by help whereof Brutes wink and cover their Eyes, when they fear any thing ſhould fall into or hit them.</p>
               <p>In the ſpaces between the muſcles and ſundry Veſſels, there is fat, which<note place="margin">The uſe of fat in the Eye.</note> heats, moiſtens, and ſo helps the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Eye, and makes it round and even.</p>

               <p>All theſe four Muſcles have the ſame beginning, the ſame progreſs and end: for the beginning of them all is acute, near the hole where the optick Nerve enters into the Socket of the Eye, from the Membrane wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they do ariſe: they have all a fleſhy and round belly: their end is a very ſmal Tendon, as was ſaid, at the Cornea.</p>

For the <hi>firſt</hi> Coat ariſes from the dura Mater; the ſecond from the pia Mater; the third from the marrowy ſubſtance in the Brain.</p>
               <p>The Tunica <hi>adnata alba</hi> or <hi>conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiva</hi> is ſmooth and thin, ariſing from<note place="margin">Adnata Tunica.</note> the Pericraneum.

               <p>This Adnata being removed, the firſt that offers it ſelf, is the <hi>Sclirotica</hi> or <hi>dura</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tunicle of the Eye.</note> ſo called, which ariſes from the dura Mater, and it is thick, ſtretched, equal, and dark on the back part. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of this they call tunica <hi>Cornea,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">Cornea.</note> it is poliſhed and tranſparent like an horn: for it may be ſcaled into four plates, over which the Epidermis is placed, and involves the whol forepart of the Eye. It is next the ſclirotica or dura, firmly cleaving in the hinder part of the <hi>Choroides,</hi> yet joyned with the Chryſtalline in the middle, that it may ſeparate the watry and glaſſie Humors.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is called <hi>Choroides,</hi> becauſe it is like the Chorion, and Veſſels are<note place="margin">2. Tunicle of the Eye.</note> ſprinkled up and down. It ariſes from pia Mater, being from the firſt Original blackiſh, eſpecially within, that the Idea's received in a dark place, might be the more illuſtrious. In Brutes it is of ſeveral Colours, ſomtimes watchet, &amp;c. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tranſparent Cornea it is in men ſomtimes skie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd, ſomtimes blew, or grey, which Colours are ſeen through the Cornea. This in its forepart is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Uvea,</hi> by reaſon it is of the colour of a Grape, in which part it is thick and doubled: it is moveable and according to the diverſity of the Object or Light, it is contracted and dilated, as we may very well diſcern in Cats.

But this is confuted by <hi>Plempius,</hi> and becauſe the Verge of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vea tunica hath divers colours, hence ariſes</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iris</hi> or Circle, which <hi>Galen, Caſſerius, Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iris.</note> reckon to be ſixfold, and <hi>Plempius</hi> but threefold: a double narrow one at the White of the Eye, a third at the Sight true and larger, illuſtrated with a conſtant colour. This Circle is ſeen variouſly coloured, and where it makes the Iris, it is ſomtimes skie-coloured, otherwhiles fierie, grey, black, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From the Circumference of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vea, where its duplicated Membrane<note place="margin">Ligamentum ciliare.</note> bends it ſelf back to the Chryſtalline, there ariſes a Ligament or <hi>Interſtitium ciliare</hi> ſo called, which are certain then filaments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of the Uvea repreſenting the black Lines of the Eye-lids, like Hairs, and they compaſs the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline humor, which by help of theſe is knit to the neighboring parts: it is moved with the Uvea being moveable. <hi>Carteſius</hi> will have its uſe to be to move the Chryſtalline, that the Situation thereof may be changed, according to the various neceſſity of ſight.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> is the <hi>Retina</hi> or <hi>Amphibleſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> as the Greeks call it, that is the Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhion'd<note place="margin">The third Coat.</note> Coat, made of the inner ſubſtance of the Brain or of ſome Nerve ſpred out as it were, the pia Mater withal accompanying in the ſame, if we believe <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Caſſerius.</hi> Therefore this ſoft, and as it were ſnotty matter may be gathered together, compaſſing the vitreous Humor and its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treous Coat like a Net.

                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:41352:78"/>I add the <hi>tunica Vitrea,</hi> which covers the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treous<note place="margin">Vitrea.</note> or glaſſie Humor on all ſides, that it run not about, and ſeparates it from the Chryſtalline Humor. It is of exceeding ſmoothneſs and thinneſs, ſhed about the Humor like a thin Skin, not only in the convex part of the ſaid Humor, but alſo in its concave part, where it receives the Chryſtalline, where indeed it cleaves cloſe to the Chryſtalline Coat, but is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from it. It is furniſhed with many, but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Veins, and the inner portion of the marrowy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Optick Nerve, cleaves to the Centre thereof. The form is ſuch as that of the glaſſie Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, large and convex behind, and concave before.</p>
               <p>The Humors of the Eyes are three, the <hi>watry,</hi> the <hi>glaſſie,</hi> and the <hi>Chryſtalline:</hi> of<note place="margin">Humors of the Eyes.</note> which the laſt is the moſt noble, and by ſome termed the Soul and <hi>Centre of the eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>watry</hi> becauſe thin and fluxive like<note place="margin">The watry Humor.</note> water, occupies the whole ſpace between the Tunica cornea, and the fore part of the Chryſtalline. <hi>Riolanus</hi> alſo proves that it is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round about the vitreous Humor, and that all of it is contained within the whole <hi>uvea tunica;</hi> becauſe the Eye being cut in the hinder part, water flows out as much as if it were cut before. But if the <hi>vitrea tunica</hi> be alſo cut with a large Wound, no wonder if water flow from thence, which <hi>Plempius</hi> alſo notes; not to ſay how eaſily the inner parts are broken, when they are rudely fingred. In the Humor Suffuſions are made.</p>
               <p>This Humor is no animated part,<note place="margin">The watry Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is no ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated part, the other Humors are.</note> but ſeems only to be an Excrement remaining after the Nutrition of the Chryſtalline Humor: for it is both conſumed in Diſeaſes, and loſt in Wounds of the Eyes; the other two humors are animated parts, ſeeing they have their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per circumſcription, are nouriſhed with blood brought Veinlets, when periſhed they are not reſtored, and are bred in the Womb: and the Chryſtalline of the moſt pure lightful part of the Seed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe of the watry</hi> Humor is to defend the borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring parts from drineſs: others add, that as a medium it ſerves to break the brightneſs continually flowing in, and to greaten the Repreſentations of the Objects, being ſtraitned in the Pupilla or Sight.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vitreous</hi> or glaſſie Humor is ſeen behind, like molten Glaſs, ſofter then<note place="margin">The vitreous of glaſſie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</note> the Chryſtalline, then which it is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs five times bigger, and twice as big as the watry Humor. It is round in its hinder part, plane before, but being concave in the middle, it makes an hollowneſs wherein the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline Humor is placed as in a Pillow. Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is not barely to nouriſh the Chryſtalline, as <hi>Galen</hi> conceived, but to prepare and communicate Nouriſhment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. According to <hi>Aquapendent</hi> from whom <hi>Riolanus</hi> had the notion, that the light carried beyond the chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline may not return defiled by dark and other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured tinctures, and ſo diſturb the Sight. <hi>Platerus</hi> more rightly, that the ſplendid vitreous Humor might fill up a neceſſary ſpace between the Chryſtalline and the Retina, which <hi>others</hi> explain more clearly, that the glaſſie. Humor may give a paſſage to the Species to the Retina, and may refract them from Perpendiculars.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chryſtalline</hi> (which ſome call the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie becauſe of its firmneſs) is ſo called<note place="margin">The Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline.</note> from its exceeding bright and ſhineing colour, which it hath, being free from all other colours, that it may receive all colours, it is ſhineing, indifferently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rd round behind, with ſome longneſs, flat on the foreſide: howbeit according to the ſundry affections of the Eye, this form is variouſly changed.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to be the chief Medium of ſight, as a glaſs held before the hole, receives the external ſpecies into a dark Cloſet, even ſo the Chryſtalline Humor, both receives and collects the Species or Repreſentations of things. And becauſe the humor is tranſparent, the Species are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſtopped therein, nor colours percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which moſt Anatomiſts have beleived after <hi>Galen;</hi> for otherwiſe there were no reaſon why they ſhould not be as well perceived in the Cornea, and vitreous Humor, both tranſparent and animated. Therefore the ſight is not primarily made in this Humor, but the Species are diſcerned in the <hi>retina tunica,</hi> becauſe there they are ſtopped by a dark Body, as we ſeen on the Wall of a Chamber, when the Windows are ſhut.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scheinerus</hi> conceives, that the Species which did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent all things the bottom upwards, are corrected and refracted in the Chryſtalline Humor, ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent all things in their due poſture. But according to the Obſervation of <hi>Job. Walaeus, Fr. Sylvius,</hi> and <hi>Fr. Vander Schagen,</hi> the Choroides, the Sclirotica, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina tunica, being taken away from behind, all things are ſeen by the Eye, and repreſented with the bottom upwards; very ſmall in an Oxes Eye, ſomwhat greater in a Mans. <hi>Plempius</hi> proves the ſame by an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a glaſs Inſtrument filled with the three Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, placed before the hole of the Window, where all things appear on the Wall with the wrong ſide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And doubtleſs the Species muſt needs be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented with the bottom upwards in the Retina, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we ſhould ſee all things the wrong end up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and not right, which <hi>Keplerus</hi> hereby demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, becauſe in paſſion the Patients muſt be juſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite againſt the Agents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Others</hi> will have it, that our Judgment corrects the depraved Figure, which diſcerns the juſt Magnitude of things by very ſmall Species received. <hi>Others</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the common Senſe, which ſeeing the inverted ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, behind and above the Cavity of the Retina, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends them in their true poſture. Finally <hi>others</hi> ſay that a true Judgment is therefore made, becauſe it is made by a right Line.</p>

               <p>THe Organ of Hearing, viz. the EARS are either external or internal.</p>
               <p>The <hi>external</hi> which are by ſome termed <hi>Auriculae</hi> the Earlets, are in Mankind of a ſemicircular Figure, convex without, concave within.</p>
               <p>The outer Ear is <hi>divided</hi> into the upper and lower part.</p>
               <p>The upper is broader, and by ſome<note place="margin">Names of the parts of the outer Ear.</note> called <hi>Pinna,</hi> by others <hi>Ala.</hi> The lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is ſoft and hanging down, termed <hi>Fibra, Auricula infima, Lobus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The outer Circumference of the Ear is called <hi>Helix,</hi> alſo <hi>Capreolus,</hi> becauſe of its wreathed formed. The inner part oppoſite to the former, is termed <hi>Scapha</hi> or <hi>Anthelix.</hi> In the middle hereof is a large Cavity, the principal part of the external Ear, called <hi>Concha.</hi> But the Cavity near the <hi>Meatus auditorius</hi> or Hearing-paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, where Ear-wax is collected, is cal'd <hi>Alvearium.</hi> Towards the Temples there grows a certain eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy like a covering, which either receives or hinders

things that would go into the Eare, and is termed <hi>Hircus</hi> the Goat, becauſe Hairs grow thereon.</p>
               <p>The Parts whereof the external Ear is compoſed, are either common, as the Skarf-Skin, the Skin, a Nervous Membrane, Fleſh, and a little Fat in the Lobe: Or Proper, as Muſcles, Veſſels, and a Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Skin</hi> is exceeding thin, cleaving to a little Fleſh with a firm Griſtle; and as in<note place="margin">Its Skin.</note> the Palms of the Hands a Nervous Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane is firmly faſten'd thereto; by the ſenſe whereof it happens that cold water ſprinkled on the Lap or Lobe of the Ear doth cool the whole Body.

               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> therefore <hi>of the External Ear,</hi> is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and rightly to receive ſounds; and to gather them when they are ſcattered in the Air into the Cavity of the Ear, that they may come unto the Drum without violence, being firſt moderated and allayed in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and winding paſſages. Hence, leaſt ſounds which are diven towards the Ears, ſhould ſlip beſide, Beaſts turn their Ears this way and that way to ſounds. Hence alſo the Emperor <hi>Hadrianus;</hi> that he might heat more diſtinctly, would hold the hollow of his Hand before his Ears, which alſo deaf perſons fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently practiſe. Hence ſome Scythians, whoſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets ar mortified and rottted of with cold, doth apply a Fiſh-ſhell to their Ears, that the Air being detained in the Cavity thereof, may be more eaſily received, that ſo they may hear the better. Hence, they hear moſt exactly, whoſe Ears ſtick furtheſt out from their Heads, and if our Ears were not too much preſſed down, what by long lying upon them. what by the binding of Nurſes, we ſhould hear better then we do.</p>

               <p>There is a certain <hi>Partition,</hi> or little Orbicular Menbrane, compaſſed with a boney circle, which ſome call <hi>Myrinx,</hi> others <hi>Sextum Membraneum</hi> and <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> others <hi>Tympanum,</hi> but ſome rightly <hi>mympani Membranula.</hi> For it is<note place="margin">Tympanum.</note> ſtretched before the internal Cavity containing the congenit Air, as the Parchment or Velam on a Drum Head. <hi>Caſſerius</hi> conceives that it ariſes from the Pericranium, but <hi>Veſlingius</hi> believe that it is an expanſion of the Perioſteum, who hath alſo obſerved it to be double, and alſo frequently cruſted over by thickned Excrements.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>exceeding dry,</hi> that it may ſound the better, for dry bodies are fitteſt for ſound.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>Tranſparent</hi> thin and ſubtile, that the ſounds may more eaſily paſs through<note place="margin">A cauſe of Deafneſs.</note> to the implanted Air: For thoſe that have it thick from their birth, have an incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Deafneſs, as thoſe alſo who have a thick Coat growing over the ſame without, the Cure whereof is nevertheleſs taught by <hi>Paulus;</hi> and if this happen from the birth, ſuch perſons continue for the moſt part Dumb, becauſe they can neither conceive in their mind nor utter with their Tongue ſuch words as they have never hard. But if a Snotty matter cleave thereto within, or a thick Humor<note place="margin">A Cauſe of thickneſs of Hearing.</note> flow thereto, a thickneſs of Hearing or a Deafneſs incurbale is thereby cauſed. If a thin Humor flow thereto, there ariſe tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and noiſes in the Ears.</p>
               <p>Finally it is Nervous, of ſo exquiſite a Senſe that, it can neither bear the putting in of a Probe, nor ſharp Humors; yet is it ſtrong ſo as to endure againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Injuries; for being hurt or corroded it cauſes thickneſs of Hearing or Deafneſs, as they find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, who have it hurt by the noiſe of great Guns or Bells, or in whom it is broken by ſwimming. For the ſafeguard therefore hereof, there are three little Bones added within (of which, the Hammer ſticks faſt to the Drum, and is ſeen through the ſame) and two Muſcles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> thereof is, to ſhut the paſſage of hearing, and to ſeparate the innate Air from that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and to keep it within. Alſo to ſave it from Duſt, Water, creeping things, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Within the Membrane of the Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panum, thereis an <hi>Internal Cavity</hi> in the<note place="margin">The Cavity of the Drum.</note> Bone, containing a certain <hi>Air,</hi> which ſome term the inbred, <hi>Congenit</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted Air, becauſe it is placed in the Ears at the firſt formation, being pure, ſubtile and immoveable: which ſome count the internal Medium of Hearing, others the Organ it ſelf of that Senſe.</p>
               <p>There are two <hi>Muſcles</hi> of the inner Ear according to Anatomiſts.<note place="margin">Muſcles of the inner Ear.</note>
               </p>
               <p>They call the firſt the <hi>Internal,</hi> ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Os petreum,</hi> with a double Tendon: The one being fixed to the higher proceſs of the Hammer, the other to its Neck.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to draw the Head of the Hammer obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely inwards, and to carry it inwards from the Anvil, and the proceſs of the Hammer being bowed back, to drive the little Membrane inwards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond is external,</hi> found out by <hi>Caſſerius,</hi> though <hi>Aquapendent</hi> doth likewiſe attribute to himſelf the Invention thereof; it is exceeding ſmal, fleſhy, and conſiſting in the upper Region of the Auditory paſſage, with its Tendon implanted into the Centre of the Membrane, there where the Hammer is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly joyned to the ſaid Membrane. So that <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanus</hi> labours in Vain by denying this Membrane in contradiction to <hi>Caſſerius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to draw the Membrane with the Hammer outwards.</p>
               <p>A certain ſmal Griſtly paſſage is to be obſerved, which goes from the <hi>Concha</hi> of the Ear near the ſides of the <hi>Pterygoidean</hi> proceſs, to the Palate. <hi>Fallopius</hi> ſaies it is a conveighance of Water, <hi>furniſhed with a ſmal Valve, Riolanus</hi> in the mean while, an old Maſter of Anatomy, denying that there is any ſuch Valve to be found.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> hereof is, 1. To purge the<note place="margin">Why Maſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories help in Diſeaſes of the Ears?</note> inbred Air, for this way Excrements paſs from the Ear into the mouth, but, not back again, becauſe there is a Valve to hinder. And this is the Reaſon that Maſticatories are very helpful in Diſeaſes of the Ears.</p>
               <p>II. To let in ſound in Deaf and ſtopped Ears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Varro</hi> writes and <hi>Pliny</hi> with <hi>Archelaus,</hi> that Goats draw in Breath at their Ears, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reports of <hi>Alcmeon.</hi> And ſuch as are ſomwhat thick of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do perceive words more diſtinctly when they Gape, and when our Ears are ſtopped, we can hear our own Speech though weakly. Such as have the Venereal Diſeaſe, are hurt not only with cold Air, but with any other uneven noiſe, paſſing through their Mouth into their Ears, as <hi>Tulpius</hi> obſerves, who alſo hath obſerved that two perſons troubled with the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thopnaea,</hi> were ſaved from choaking, by voiding their Breath out at their Ears, by means of this paſſage. Thoſe do abuſe this paſſage, who render the ſmoak of Tobacco which they take, through their Ears.</p>
               <p>Finally, we meet with the <hi>Nervous Auditories</hi> or Hearing Nerve, which proceeds from the fift pair of the Brain, entring the Ear through the hole of <hi>Os Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſum.</hi> It touches the <hi>Cochlea</hi> and the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> with a double branch that it may in both places perfect the Hearing. To which a Branch is added to move the Muſcles, proceeding from the fourth pair, and cleft in two.</p>

               <p>The <hi>External</hi> is Extrinſecally divided into the upper and lower part.</p>
               <p>The <hi>upper part</hi> which is boney and immoveable, is termed the Back of the Noſe, and its Acuminated part, <hi>Spina.</hi> The lower part is Griſtley and moveable, the utmoſt end wherof is termed <hi>Globulus</hi> and <hi>Orbiculus,</hi> by the only feeling whereof <hi>Michael Scotus</hi> pretends to tel whether a Maiden have loſt her Virginity. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral or ſide parts are termed <hi>Pterugia alae, Pinnae;</hi> that is Wings or Pinnacles, that fleſhy part which ſticks out in the middle near the Lips, is called <hi>Columna</hi> the Pillar.</p>
               <p>The Noſe is divided within, by a partition Wall, into two Holes or Cavities which they call <hi>Nares</hi> the

Noſtrils: that one hole being ſtopped, we may draw in and paſs out the Air by the other. And when both are ſtopped, the Mouth ſupplies the Office of the Noſtrils. Now each hole is again <hi>divided</hi> about the middle of the Noſe <hi>into two parts:</hi> the one aſcends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to the <hi>Os Spongioſum;</hi> the other goes above the Palate into the Throat and upper part of the Mouth. Hence drink ſomtimes comes out at the Noſtrils: and things put into the Noſtrils, the Noſe being ſhut, are wont to ſlip into the Mouth. Hence alſo the thicker Excrements alſo of the Brain, while they are carryed downward to the Noſtrils, may ſlide into the Mouth, or be brought thither by Hawking, and ſo purged out at the Mouth.</p>

               <p>THe laſt Organ of Senſe remains, viz. the <hi>Tongue</hi> the Organ of Taſting, which before I explain, I muſt propound the external parts about the Mouth, and the internal parts in the Mouth.</p>
               <p>The external parts about the mouth are ſundry. The <hi>upper</hi> part under the<note place="margin">The Names of the outward parts about the Mouth.</note> Eyes, between the Noſe and the Ears, by reaſon of its uſual Redneſs, and the unuſual by reaſon of bluſhing, is called <hi>Pudoris ſedes</hi> the <hi>Seat of ſhamefaſtneſs, Maium</hi> or <hi>Pomum</hi> the Apple, alſo <hi>Circulus Faciei,</hi> the Circle of the Face.</p>
               <p>The <hi>lower</hi> and looſer part which may be blown up, as we ſee in Trumpeters, is termed <hi>Bucca</hi> the Cheek, the upper part of the Lip is called <hi>Myſtax.</hi> The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity imprinted therein and dividing the ſame, is called <hi>Philtrum,</hi> from its lovelineſs. Now the Lips are two, the upper and the lower, and the chink between both, is termed <hi>Os</hi> the Mouth. The outer parts of the Lips which hang over, are called <hi>Prolabia.</hi> The lower part under the lower Lip is called <hi>Mentum</hi> the Chin; the fleſhy part under the Chin is termed <hi>Buccula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Mouth conſiſts of parts, partly boney, as the <hi>upper</hi> and <hi>lower Jaw</hi> with the <hi>teeth;</hi> partly fleſhy, as the <hi>Lips, Lip-muſcles, Cheek-muſcles,</hi> and <hi>lower Jaw-muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole inner capacity of the Mouth is cloarhed with a thick <hi>Coat,</hi> which goes alſo about the Gums and Lips, and is thought to be doubled when it conſtitutes the Uvula.</p>

               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> lies under this, which makes the Cheeks with its Bulk, and therefore is termed <hi>Buccinator</hi> the trumpetting Muſcle, which is moſt conſpicuous in Trumpetters.</p>
               <p>Tis <hi>round</hi> like a Circle, thin and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous; interwoven with ſundry Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,<note place="margin">The Figure of the Muſcle Buccinator.</note> inſeparably clothed with the coat of the Mouth.</p>

               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to move the Cheeks and Lips: and it is to the teeth inſtead of an hand, while it thruſts the meat this way and that way to the teeth, that it may be more exactly chewed.</p>

               </list>
               <p>There are ſome <hi>proper Muſcles of the Lips</hi> beſides the common ones aforeſaid, which nevertheleſs may vary in reſpect of number. Some reckon fewer, and others more: for ſome are by ſome Authors counted ſimple, which others reckon to be manifold.</p>
               <p>The proper Muſcles which move the upper Lip, are on each ſide two. Three there are which move both Lips. The lower Lip is moved only by one proper pare.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt pare</hi> proper to the upper lip, is a remarkable pare deſcribed by <hi>Fallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Four pare of muſcles mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lip.</note> which <hi>ſlipping down</hi> from the corner betwixt the Eyes and Noſe, is ſtraight way <hi>ſunk</hi> into the Subſtance of the upper Lip.</p>
               <p>The other pare, ariſing from the upper Jaw-bone, juſt in the Cavity of the Cheeks under the Socket of the Eye, thin but broad, fleſhy, ſunk into ſtore of Fat, is carried down wards right on, to the upper Lip, which moves it directly upwards with the firſt pare. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo it is obliquely inſerted into the confines of both the Lips, wherefore ſome do make two pare ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt pare</hi> common to both Lips, is long, fleſhy, broad at the<note place="margin">Muſcles common to both Lips.</note> beginning; <hi>ariſes</hi> outwardly from the Jugal proceſs, and deſcending obliquely through the Cheeks, it is <hi>terminated</hi> in the ſpace between the two Lips. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have ſeen it from the beginning drawn out as a Rope to the firſt proper pare. Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is; to draw both the Lips obliquely upwards towards the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond common pare</hi> of the Lips, from the lower Jaw-bone to the ſides of the chin, fleſhy, ariſes with a broad beginning, and ſometimes ſtretched out to the middle of the chin, grows by little and little narrower' till it is obliquely inſerted into the ſame confine of each Lip, but lower, which draws away the Lips ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely downwards and outwards, in ſuch as grin and gern for anger.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third Muſcle</hi> common to the two Lips is circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar like a Sphincter encompaſſing and conſtituting the whole Mouth, ſpungy, and firmly ſticking to the rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Skin, it draws the Mouth together, when people ſimper as Virgins are wont to do.</p>
               <p>The <hi>proper pare</hi> of the <hi>lower Lip</hi> is called<note place="margin">Muſcles of the lower Lip.</note> 
                  <hi>Par Mentale,</hi> the <hi>Chin-pare; ariſing</hi> from the middle of the Chin with a broad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and aſeends directly to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the lower Lip, which it moves downwards.</p>
               <p>Now all the Muſcles of the Lips, are ſo mixed with the Skin, that the Fibres do croſs one another mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore the motions of the Lips are very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <p>To cauſe that exquiſite Senſe which is in the Lips, Branches of Nerves are ſent thither, and Veins and Arteries from the neighbouring places: from whence that ſame ruddy ſplendor of the Lips proceeds, a note of Beauty and of Health.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſcles of the lower Jaw</hi> (for it is<note place="margin">Muſcles of the lower Jaw.</note> moved) the upper being immoveable) ſome reckon eight, others ten, called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticatorij, Manſorij, Molares,</hi> Chewers, Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Grinders, becauſe they ſerve for the chewing or grinding of the meat. One only pare depreſſes the Jaw, becauſe it is apt to go downwards of it ſelf: the other pares ſetch it up, which are exceeding ſtrong ones. Hence it is that ſome can take heavy weights from the ground with their teeth, and ſo carry them. Hence phrantick and otherwiſe diſtracted perſons do ſhut their mouths with ſo much ſtubbornneſs and ſtrength, that they can hardly be opened with great force and iron Inſtruments. Contrariwiſe, the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſt perſon in the World may be compelled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much ado, to ſhut his or her mouth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> Muſcle is termed <hi>Crotaphites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Temporalis.</note> the <hi>temporal</hi> Muſcle from its Scituation, becauſe it poſſeſſes the Cavity of the Temples.</p>
               <p>This is the greateſt of them all, firm and ſtrong, yet firmer and ſtronger in ſome Beaſts, as Lyons, Wolves, Dogs, Swine, &amp;c. which were naturally to bite hard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Forth <hi>End</hi> of the temporal Muſcle, is in the begining of the lower Jaw, which<note place="margin">The uſe of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now it ariſes from the Temples wich a beginning broad, fleſhy, and ſemicircular, and by little and little grows narrower as it deſcends.</p>
               <p>Three <hi>Nerves</hi> are on each ſide inſerted<note place="margin">Why tis dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to hurt the temporal muſcle.</note> thereinto, two from the third pare, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the fift pare. And therefore this Muſcle being wounded or bruiſed, there is great danger of Convulſion and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41352:82"/>
of Death in concluſion; eſpecially if the lower part be hurt which is moſt Nervous. And becauſe of the diſtention hereof, <hi>Hypocrates</hi> did pronounce the Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the lower Jaw-bone to be deadly; unleſs it were put preſently in joynt again.</p>
               <p>For ſafeguard ſake, Nature hath given it, 1. A <hi>Membrane</hi> thick and hard, and black and blew in color, wherewith it is covered, and ſhines with a neat color; the Pericraneum, ſo that the inner part of the Muſcle being all fleſhy, doth there ſtick to the bone without the Pericranium. 2. The <hi>Os jugale</hi> over the lower part Tendinous and Nervous. 3. She hath fenced the Tendon with fleſh above and beneath.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Muſcle is the <hi>Manſorius pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, firſt chewer,</hi> called <hi>Maſſeter, Molitor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Manſorius primus.</note> and <hi>Mandibularis,</hi> or <hi>Lateralis,</hi> ſeated in the Cheeks.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> from a double Head: the one fleſhy, the other Nervous, from the <hi>Os jugale,</hi> and the firſt bone of the upper Jaw. It is <hi>implanted</hi> into the lower part of the Jaw-bone (by a Connexion ſufficiently broad and ſtrong) which it turns this way and that way, in ſuch as are eating. For the Fibres of the Head do ſo interfere and croſs one another, that they move the Jaw both forwards and backwards and ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</p>
               <p>The third pair is the <hi>Pterygoides</hi> or <hi>Alare externum,</hi> the outward Wing-muſcle, the<note place="margin">Alaris.</note> finding whereof we owe to <hi>Fallopius;</hi> but <hi>Veſalius</hi> accounts it a part of the temporal Muſcle. 'Tis ſeated under the temporal.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> from the <hi>Os Sphaenoideum</hi> and the external <hi>proceſſus Alaris,</hi> with a beginning partly Nervous and partly fleſhy. <hi>'Tis implanted</hi> into the Neck of the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer Jaw-bone, and the inner ſeat of the Head there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to move forwards and thruſt out.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is termed <hi>Manſorius alter,</hi> the other Chewer, or <hi>Alaris internus,</hi> being<note place="margin">Manſorius alter.</note> thick and ſhort.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> Nervous from the Productions of <hi>Os Sphaenoideum</hi> called <hi>Alatae internae;</hi> and is inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the inner and hinder part of the Jaw, with a broad and ſtrong Tendon.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to draw the Jaw upward and backward, to aſſiſt the temporal Muſcle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fift</hi> is termed <hi>Graphyoides,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">Graphyoides.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> from the Appendix Styloides, Membranou,s and broad, and ſoon becoming round and fleſhy, tis <hi>inſerted</hi> into the Chin. Hence it is ſeen to have a double belly, and therefore 'tis alſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Digaſtricus,</hi> twi-belly. 'Tis faſtned to a Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment leaſt it ſhould go too far back. For,</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to draw the Jaw downwards and ſo to open the Mouth.</p>
               <p>Others do reckon for another pair, part of the <hi>Muſculus quadratus,</hi> fixed in the middle of the Chin. Which broadeſt Muſcle, ariſing from the upper part of the Breſt-bone, the Channel bone and the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tip, and covering the Neck and the whole Face, after <hi>Galen, Sylvius,</hi> and <hi>Theophilus, Riolanus</hi> deſcribes in this place.

               <p>Some think it helps to modulate the Voice, and therefore they call it <hi>Plectrum vocis,</hi> the<note place="margin">Vulgar Error.</note> ſtriking quil of the Voice. But though it be wounded or quite cut off, yet is not the voice hurt, unleſs ſome neighbouring parts, which aſſiſt the voice are alſo damaged: for then by the roughneſs of thoſe parts, cauſed by thoſe Catarrhes, which have eaten the Uvula, the Voice becomes Hoarſe.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Uſe is, to hinder drink from paſſing out of the Mouth into the Noſtrils. And therefore <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth</hi> tels of the Son of a Man called <hi>John,</hi> who being born without any Uvula or Almonds, voided the Milk which he ſuckt, out of his Noſe, and did not live long.</p>
               <p>By FAUCES ſometimes we underſtand the whole wideneſs of the Mouth: but more ſtrictly it is meant of the hinder and lower part, which cannot be ſeen, but when the Mouth is wide open and the Tongue held down, the Greeks term it <hi>Pharynx,</hi> howbeit that word in <hi>Hypocrates</hi> doth oftentimes ſignifie the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of this part, as Inflammation, &amp;c. <hi>Galen</hi> calls it <hi>Iſthmus</hi> becauſe of the narrowneſs of the place.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Fauces</hi> is that Bone which from the ſhape of the Greek letter <hi>v</hi> is<note place="margin">Names of the Os hyoides.</note> called <hi>Hyoides, Hypſiloides,</hi> alſo from reſemblance to the letter Λ <hi>Lambdoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> that is the Upſilon or Lambda-ſhaped Bone. 'Tis alſo called <hi>Os gutturis,</hi> the Throat-bone, and <hi>Os linguae,</hi> the Tongue-bone, of which I muſt treat in this place, and not in the Hiſtory of the Bones, becauſe it is not faſtned to the other parts of the Skeleton.</p>
               <p>Now the Bone is the Baſis and Foundation of the Tongue, upon which it is placed and moved: and it is ſet before the Larynx.</p>
               <p>It conſiſts of ſundry little bones, three at leaſt, ſometimes of five, ſeven,<note place="margin">Its Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> nine.</p>
               <p>The middle Bone is the greateſt, bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching without, hollow within, under which ſticks the

               <p>Its proceſſes are faſtened to the Ligaments and ends of the <hi>Styloides,</hi> alſo with the Cartilago gutta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Bone is moved,</hi> but not except the Tongue be moved; and therefore it<note place="margin">Its Muſcles.</note> hath four pair of Muſcles common to the Tongue, nor can the Muſcles of the Tongue be ſhewed till they are removed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt pair</hi> lies concealed in the fore-part, under the Skin, reſting upon the Weſand and the Cartilago Scutalis.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> with a broad and fleſhy beginning, from the higher and inner Region of the Breaſt-bone; and therefore this pair is called <hi>Sterno-hyoides.</hi> Its <hi>End</hi> is fleſhy, in the Baſis of <hi>Os hyoides.</hi> And in the middle according to their leng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> from the inner part of the lower Jaw, with a various carriage of Fibres: it is <hi>ended</hi> in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſeat of the <hi>Hyoides.</hi> Some call it <hi>Genio-hyoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to draw right upwards and a little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> is lean and round, ſeated under the Chin, ariſing from the Root of the Appendix of Styloides; it <hi>ends</hi> into the horns of the Hyoides. Somtimes they are bored through the middle, for the Muſcle which opens the Jaw.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to move ſidewayes, and a little obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely upwards. 'Tis called <hi>Stylo-cerato-hyoides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> being lean and long, lies concealed under that Muſcle of the Scapula which they count the fourth, moving downwards and obliquely ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> from the upper ſide of the Scapula, near the proceſſus Coracoides, and therefore 'tis called <hi>Coraco-hyoides:</hi> it is carryed upwards obliquely to the ſides of the <hi>Os hyoides,</hi> under that Muſcle of the Head which is counted the ſeventh. And this pair is long, hath two Bellies, and is extenuated in the middle like a Tendon, like that which draws down the lower Jaw.</p>

               <p>THe TONGUE called <hi>Lingua a lingendo</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The tongue.</note> from licking.</p>
               <p>Is <hi>placed</hi> in Mankind, in the Mouth<note place="margin">Its Scituation.</note> under the Palate thereof:</p>
               <p>Is in <hi>Number</hi> one, in Sea-Calfes two, in<note place="margin">Number.</note> Serpents divided into three parts, in Lizards and Snakes divided into two parts.</p>
               <p>In Man 'tis long, broad and thick, and<note place="margin">Figure.</note> thicker at the Root, thinner and ſharper at the End.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>ſize</hi> is moderate anſwerable to the mouth, which if it be too great, ſo that<note place="margin">Magnitude.</note> it cannot move readily, it makes a man Liſpe and Stutter; and if it be overſoft and moiſt as in young Children, they cannot ſpeak plainly. <hi>Galen, Carnerarius, Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> and <hi>M. Donatus,</hi> have obſerved the tongue grown to ſo monſtrous a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that it could not be contained within the mouth.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Connexion,</hi> in fiſhes the whole tongue cleaves to their mouth;<note place="margin">Its Connexion.</note> in mankind, it is in its hinder part faſtned to the Larynx, and the <hi>Os hyoides,</hi> alſo to the Fauces and Tonſillae. Beneath in the middle of its body 'tis faſtned with a ſtrong membranous Ligament for ſtrength and ſtabilities ſake; alſo for the inſertion of its proper muſcles, whoſe extremity is termed <hi>Fraenulum;</hi> nor can any other ſtring be found diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from this. This in many new born Children, doth ſo tie the whole tongue, that it is wont to be torn by the Nail of the Midwife (which is nevertheleſs a Pernitious courſe and<note place="margin">A Pernitious Practice of midwives.</note> not to be allowed) or the ſmall Knife of a Chirurgeon, that it may not hinder the Childs ſucking or future ſpeaking, and that it may freely turn and move it ſelf. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit for want of skill, they cut it in all Infants indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, whereas not one of a thouſand, when it is let alone, doth ſtammer.</p>
               <p>'Tis cloathed with a Coat (hard in ſuch<note place="margin">Its Coat.</note> as uſe to ſwallow very hot Liquors) ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily thin, ſoft, and porous, that taſts may eaſily peirce into the tongues fleſhy</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Subſtance,</hi> which is a peculiar kind of<note place="margin">Subſtance.</note> fleſh, ſuch as is not in the Body beſides (and it is the Organ of taſt, not the Coat, as <hi>Galen</hi> would have it, nor the Nervus Guſtatorius, as ſome from <hi>Columbus</hi>) ſoft, looſe, rare and ſpungy, to drink in the taſts brought to it with ſome humidity. In Fiſhes and ſome other Animals 'tis bony. It is rather of a kernelly then a Muſculous ſubſtance, eſpecially about the Baſis thereof.</p>
               <p>For the tongue is no Muſcle, ſeeing<note place="margin">Whether the tongue be a muſcle.</note> it hath no Fibres, nor moves any other part, but is moved by its Muſcles. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers add this Reaſon, becauſe then mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be made towards the end of a Muſcle, and the tail of a Muſcle ſhould be moveable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the head immoveable. But this Reaſon is falſe. For the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the tongue is near the Larynx, and ariſes as it were from the <hi>Os Hyoides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to <hi>Veſſels.</hi> Two remarkable Veins<note place="margin">Its Veſſels.</note> are to be ſeen under the tongue, which are wont to be opened in Quinzies and Diſeaſes of the Fauces, termed <hi>Raninae</hi> from their color, ariſing from the external Jugulars, theſe</p>
               <p>

               <p>

               <p>The Tongue is diſtinguiſhed in the middle of its ſurface, into the right and<note place="margin">The line of the tongue.</note> left part, by a certain <hi>white line,</hi> which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> terms <hi>Mediana.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>firſt pair,</hi> which in Oxen is double fleſhy and thick, <hi>ariſes</hi> from the out ſide of the Appendix <hi>Styloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> being Maigre in Mankind: it <hi>ends</hi> with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Fibres, into both ſides of the Tongue, about the middle thereof.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to move the Tongue inwards. But by reaſon of the Fibres interwoven, they lift the Tongue upwards if they act both together; but upwards only to one ſide, if only one of them act. This pair is called <hi>Stylogloſſum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond pair</hi> is called <hi>Mylogloſſum, ariſing</hi> from the ſides of the lower jaw, at the Roots of the grinding Teeth. Tis inſerted under the Baſis of the tongue, into the tongues Ligament. <hi>Riolanus</hi> will have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Os hyoides,</hi> becauſe it touches not the tongue. But it ſuffices to move the tongue, if it be affixed to the Ligament thereof.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe;</hi> when one acts, the tongue is moved ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely upwards; when both act, it moves with its point right to the Palate and upper teeth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ARiſtotle</hi> calls the Arm with its Hand,<note place="margin">The uſe of the Hand.</note> 
                  <hi>Organon Organón,</hi> the Inſtrument of Inſtruments, wherewith Man otherwiſe naked and unarmed is guifted, that he may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the Brute-beaſts and conquered by them; but may overcome them, making for himſelf Weapons, and other neceſſary Inſtruments. Man therefore hath received Reaſon and Hands, which Beaſts have not; and the Hand is his Servant and Inſtrument.</p>
               <p>Now the old Writers <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> by HAND did underſtand that<note place="margin">Manus what?</note> Part of the Body, from the top of the Shoulder to the ends of the Fingers, and this is termed <hi>ſumma Manus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is <hi>divided</hi> into the Arm and Hand ſtrictly ſo called, or the <hi>extrema manus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Arm</hi> is divided again, into the Shoulder and Cubit, the <hi>Shoulder</hi> is the part of the Arm from the Shoulder-tip to the bending of the Elbow.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cubit</hi> is that part from the bending of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow unto the Wriſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Manus extrema</hi> or <hi>Hand properly ſo called, is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the Brachiale</hi> or <hi>Wriſt,</hi> which is the part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Elbow and Palm; into the Poſtbrachiale or Metacarpum, <hi>after-wriſt,</hi> which is the part between the Wriſt and beginning of the Fingers, and into the Fingers. The Poſtbrachial part internal is called the <hi>Palm</hi> of the Hand, the external part is called the <hi>Back</hi> of the Hand.</p>
               <p>There are many <hi>Fingers,</hi> that the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Why many Fingers on the Hand?</note> of the Hand might be the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, which is laying hold: alſo that we might be able to take up the ſmalleſt matters, which we do by two fingers, and other things of many-ſhaped Figures: and becauſe all things could not be comprehended with one hand, two were made that meeting together, the one might help the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>right</hi> Hand is more active com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and more ready for motion, not<note place="margin">Why the right Hand is more active then the left?</note> for thoſe cauſes which others childiſhly cite, but 1. Becauſe in a mans right ſide is the <hi>Vena ſine pari</hi> ſo called, which peradventure is double in ſuch as can uſe both hands alike. 2. Becauſe the bones are more heavy in the Shoulder, Shoulder-blade and whol arm, then on the other ſide, as ſome men know for certain; which may proceed from an impreſſion of more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Heat in the Mothers Womb, the right part wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is hotter then the other. Hence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches, that naturally the right hand excels the left; and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, he tells us the firſt endeavor of motion is on the right ſide; ſo that when a man is about to walk, firſt moves his right Leg; a Bird about to flie, moves firſt its right wing. 3. Becauſe the trunk of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clavian Artery is greater on the right ſide then the left, as they know that have diligently conſidered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in oppoſition to <hi>Riolanus,</hi> though the difference is not, neither needed to be very great. <hi>Plato</hi> conceives that all men are naturally ambidexters, viz. that they can uſe both hands alike, and that it is mens unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ignorance that makes them right handed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or left handed. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is of Opinion, that from our firſt Formation, the right ſides of our Bodies, are alwaies in a manner hotter and ſtronger then the left, unleſs any man by much cuſtom, and much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, do draw much Heat and Spirit to his left Hand that he may become Ambidexter, and able to uſe it as his right.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Fingers</hi> for perfection of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction<note place="margin">The number of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> are made five in number, differing in length and thickneſs. Tis beſides na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if either the Fingers be quite wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which I have ſeen at <hi>Malta</hi> and at <hi>Florence;</hi> or if in place of true Fingers there appear only certain ſoft

marks as big as Peaſon, which I lately obſerved here at <hi>Hafnia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is cal'd <hi>Pollex</hi> a Pollendo becauſe of its ſtrength, and it alone is oppoſed to the whole four, when any thing is to be taken up, and therefore it is thick.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is cal'd <hi>Index</hi> and <hi>Demonſtrator,</hi> the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, or pointer: becauſe therewith we point at any thing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> is the longeſt and middlemoſt, cal'd <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudicus</hi> the <hi>ſhameleſs,</hi> becauſe Phyſitians uſe it in filthy and ſtinking places; not is it wont to be adorned with Rings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is termed <hi>Medicus,</hi> alſo <hi>Annularis,</hi> the <hi>Ring-finger,</hi> becauſe it is adorned with a Gold Ring before any of the reſt, by reaſon of a common bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> falſe opinion Repugnant to Anatomy, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Vein ſhould come from the Heart to this Finger above all the reſt; now the Heart is comforted with Gold.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fift</hi> cal'd <hi>Auricularis</hi> the Ear-finger, becauſe fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to pick the Ears, is ſmalleſt, <hi>and by us cal'd the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Finger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cauſe therefore of <hi>laying hold,</hi> which is the action of the Hand, or<note place="margin">Laying hold.</note> as others ſpeak leſs accurately, its chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt uſe, is the apt compoſition of the<note place="margin">How the Hand is compounded?</note> whole Hand. Yet the chief Organ of this motion is a Muſcle: the ſtrength is in the Bones, which are three in every fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the lower of which as the ſuſtainer is alwaies greater then that which is above it and ſtronger, and in the Joynts they are furniſhed on each fide with a Griſtle, on which an Oyly moiſture is poured out for Hummectations ſake, and to Facilitate the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>A <hi>ſecondary</hi> uſe of the Arms and Hands as <hi>Kyperus</hi> learnedly Diſcourſes, is the better to help our going by their weight and ballancing; Yea and to ſpeed our going; and therefore dancers on the Ropes, whoſe Foot is broader then that which they tread on, do bear themſelves up with long Poles, and when they dance a pace, they ballance themſelves with their Hands, which they move this way and that way.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nails</hi> are placed externally on the tops of the Fingers, as alſo of<note place="margin">Of the Nails.</note> the Toes: whoſe upmoſt part being white, is called the Root of the Nailes, the white half Moon, and the little Skin which grows to the Root.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>matter</hi> is not Alimentary Humors; as <hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Pariſanus</hi> and <hi>Plempius</hi> would have it, and others, but thick Excrements, not which aſcend from the Heart, as <hi>Roſa Anglicana</hi> conceives; or from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, but from the Bones and Griſtles, as the great <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth affirm.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Efficient</hi> is that heat which the Soul directs to this rather then any other part of the Body. But the Nailes are not made by the Soul, as <hi>Pariſanus</hi> and <hi>Plempius</hi> contend, becauſe in Cacochymick and Phlegmatick perſons they grow more abundantly, in ſuch as have been twenty five years dead, according to the obſervation of <hi>Pareus.</hi> Nor are we moved when they ſay that there is a great variety of colours in horns and ſhels of Fiſhes, for they no more prove the action of the Soul in ſuch things, then in party co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured and ſpeckled Marble.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Uſe</hi> is,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. To fence the ends of the Fingers and Toes which are exceeding ſoft, and to ſaveguard them by their hardneſs, ſo that they may more eaſily take up any thing. So in the Feet, that they may be able to reſiſt the hardneſs of the Ground and ſtand firm. And therefore it was ill ſaid by him of old, that the Gods had erred in their placeing the Nails.</item>
                  <item>II. For ornament: and therefore we cover our Fingers when the Nails are impaired.</item>
                  <item>III. To rub, ſcrarch and defend, which is a ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary uſe.</item>
                  <item>IV. To free the Body from ſuperfluous Humors and ſteams Fuliginous.</item>
                  <item>V. To afford Phyſiognomiſts and Phyſitians tokens of Life and Health, which may be ſeen in divers au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. And <hi>Achmetes</hi> ch. 74. 75. interprets dreams concerning them, according to the Tradition of the Indians, Perſians and Aegyptians.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Their <hi>form</hi> we gather from the Accidents.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Figure</hi> is ſomwhat convex, that they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to the Fingers.</p>
               <p>They have a ſubſtance indifferently hard that they may reſiſt, but yet flexible, that they may yeild a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and not break.</p>
               <p>They are <hi>Tranſparent</hi> and therefore<note place="margin">Colour of the Nails and ſigns from thence.</note> variouſly coloured: for according to the fleſh beneath them, they are red, blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, &amp;c. And therefore Phyſitians are wont to obſerve the Colour of the Nails; for the Nails, for examples ſake, grow pale when the heat of the Heart is deficient; in ſuch as are at deaths door they are livid and brown. Thoſe ſame white ſpots which in yong people ſomtimes appear in their Nails, ſpring from a vigorous heat, which drives hidden Excrements to the Nails, and ſeparates them from others of a different Nature.</p>
               <p>They are <hi>knit</hi> about the Root with a<note place="margin">Whence the ſenſe of the nails proceeds</note> Ligament, and Skin grows about them without; and fleſh grows under them, or rather the tendons of Muſcles, there dilated: there is therefore in that place an exquiſite ſenſe, and great pain when they are hurt.</p>
               <p>And ſo much may ſuffice to have ſpoken of the Nails, briefly, and by way of Compendium.</p>

               <p>eight and <hi>Caſſerius</hi> nine. For the Arm is ſaid to be lift up by two Muſcles, <hi>Deltoides</hi> and <hi>Supra-ſpinatus;</hi> and downwards by two, the <hi>Ani ſcalptor</hi> and <hi>Rotundus major:</hi> forewards by one alone, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Pectoralis;</hi> backwards by three, the <hi>Infra-ſpinatus</hi> and <hi>Sub-ſcapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris,</hi> and the <hi>Tranſverſus brevior.</hi> But they conceive the circular motion thereof is cauſed by all of them acting one after another: but others will have the Arm to be wheeled about by the <hi>Infra-ſpinatus, Supra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpinatus,</hi> and <hi>Sub-ſcapularis.</hi> But I ſhall in recounting them follow the order of Diſſection.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is termed <hi>Pectoralis,</hi> becauſe it takes up the Breaſt or forepart of the Cheſt being great and fleſhy; which <hi>Galen</hi> conceived might be divided into three or four.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> from wellnigh the whole Breſt-bone, and the Griſtles thereto annexed; where it is a little ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous in part of the <hi>Clavicula,</hi> and the fift, ſixt and ſeventh true Ribs. 'Tis implanted with a ſhort, broad Nervous and ſtrong tendon, into the <hi>Os Humeri,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Deltoides and the Biceps.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to move the Arm to the Breſt, and as the Fibres are contracted more to the upper or lower part or right forward, ſo doth the Arm incline this way or that way. This is the Muſcle which ſuffers in that torment which the Italians call <hi>Tratta de corda,</hi> the Strappado. For it is very much haled and drawn a ſunder, when the Arms are pulled forcibly back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is called <hi>Deltoides,</hi> from its likeneſs to the Greek letter Δ alſo <hi>Triangularis Humeralis,</hi> which is fleſhy and ſo abides, and is ſpread upon the Head of the Shoulder.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> from the middle of the <hi>Clavicula,</hi> looking towards the <hi>Scapula,</hi> and from the top of the <hi>Humerus,</hi> with a fleſhy end indeed, but yet a ſtrong tendon lies concealed therein.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to lift up the Arm. In the<note place="margin">The place of an Iſſue in the Arm.</note> middle hereof the Ancients were wont to make Fontanels or Iſſues; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the external part of the ſaid Muſcles: but an Iſſue is better made in the ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Deltoides and the Biceps, as I ſhew in <hi>my Treatiſe of Iſſues,</hi> becauſe 1. There is the Cephalick or Head Vein. 2. It is between two Muſcles. 3. It may be very well ſeen and dreſſed by the Patient. Now the place is exactly found below the Shoulder joynt, four or five Fingers bredth, where when you bend the Arm you may feel the ſpace between the two Muſcles, and the Arm being lift up, it is Circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in fat perſons with a ſmall Cavity, as <hi>Claudinus, Solenander</hi> and others obſerve. <hi>Ferrara</hi> meaſures four Fingers bredth from the Elbow upwards. See alſo <hi>Glandorpius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:41352:88"/>The third is <hi>broadeſt of all,</hi> and with its fellow covers almoſt the whole Back. 'Tis called <hi>Ani Scalptor, Claw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breech,</hi> becauſe it draws the Arm backwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>It ariſes with a membranous and very broad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, from the points of the Vertebra's of the Back bone, from the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> and <hi>Ilium,</hi> as far as to the ſix: Vertebra of the Cheſt. It is inſerted between the Pectoral and the round Muſcle, with a ſtrong, ſhort and broad Tendon. Its <hi>ſhape</hi> is triangular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fallopius</hi> out of <hi>Galen</hi> againſt <hi>Veſalius,</hi> doth teach that this Muſcle is furniſhed with a new, but very ſmal beginning, while from the lower Corner of the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-blades, it receives very many fleſhy Fibres. This Muſcle becauſe it hath a large beginning, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore divers Fibres; according as they are variouſly contracted, ſo the Shoulder is either drawn more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or depreſſed more downwards. And becauſe it alſo paſſes through the lower corner of the Shoulder blade therefore it lightly draws the ſame alſo away with the Shoulder.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is called <hi>Rotundus major,</hi> and it is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely ſeated behind, under the Axilla, being fleſhy, thick, and rounder then the reſt.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> fleſhy from the Rib of the lower Scapula, and aſcending a little with its tendon, ſhort, broad, and ſtrong, it is implanted with the Pectoral, into the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and lower part of the <hi>Humerus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to draw the Arm downwards and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and to work contrary to the Deltoides.</p>
               <p>The firſt is ſhort and round, quite fleſhy, which ariſes with a ſharp beginning out of the loweſt corner of the Scapula; after it grows thicker and thicker to the middle of its belly, and thence growing ſmaller by little and little, it <hi>terminates</hi> with an acute end into that Ligament, wherewith the Head of the Shoulder is involved.</p>
               <p>It hath an oblique <hi>Scituation,</hi> and ſome call it <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus muſculus brevior,</hi> others <hi>Rotundus minor.</hi> And it is the eighth in <hi>Fallopius</hi> his account: which Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle others ſuppoſe to be a certain portion of the fourth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſixt</hi> is called <hi>Infra-ſpinatus,</hi> alſo <hi>Superſcapularis inferior,</hi> becauſe it covers the whole external bunching part of the Scapula, whoſe form alſo it bears; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming more narrow, it is with a broad and ſhort Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament inſerted into the Shoulder.</p>
               <p>It is thought to wheel the Arm backwards and outwards.<note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſeventh</hi> is the <hi>Supraſpinatus,</hi> alſo <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcapularis ſuperior,</hi> alſo <hi>Rotundus minor;</hi> it is fleſhy and ſomewhat longiſh, over the Armpit; it fills the Cavity between the upper Rib of the ſcapula, and the Spina thereof, out of which it <hi>grows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is <hi>inſerted</hi> with a broad and ſtrong tendon, into the Neck of the Humerus, at the Ligament of the joynt, being carryed above the firſt joynt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of this is thought to be the ſame with that of the former. Others conceive it moves upwards with the Deltois.</p>
               <p>The eighth is termed <hi>Subſcapularis</hi> or <hi>Immerſus;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very fleſhy, it quarters betwixt the Scapula and the Ribs, and takes up the inner part of the Scapula; but it is inſerted with a broad tendon, internally, into the ſecond Ligament of the Humerus.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to bring about the Arm inwards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ninth</hi> Muſcle was firſt obſerved by <hi>Arantius</hi> and <hi>Placentinus,</hi> being in the former part of the Arm and called <hi>Perforatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ariſes from the <hi>Coracoides Proceſſus</hi> of the <hi>Scapula</hi> (and is therefore by <hi>Riolanus</hi> called <hi>Coracordeus,</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racobrachiaeus</hi>) it is <hi>inſerted</hi> into the inner part of the Shoulder about the middle, by the tendon of the Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toides. It hath a beginning nervous and ſhort, a long round Belly ſufficiently corpulent, and a ſtrong ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Its Belly hath an hole bored in it, and gives paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Nerves, which are diſtributed to the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Cubit. This Muſcle others have only ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Muſculous Portion of the Biceps.</p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>uſeful</hi> to draw the Arm to the Proceſs of the Scapula; or draw it forward upon the Breaſt.</p>

               <p>BEcauſe the <hi>Scapula</hi> is moved forward and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; upward, and downward; therefore it hath received <hi>four Muſcles.</hi> To which nevertheleſs others add two more,<note place="margin">The Error of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Anatomiſts.</note> viz. the <hi>Serratus major</hi> and the <hi>Diga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricus,</hi> but they do not well. For the later is proper to the <hi>Oshyoides,</hi> the former to the Cheſt.</p>
               <p>I. The firſt is called SERRATUS MINOR, and it is ſpred under the <hi>Muſculus pectoralis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ariſes from the four upper Ribs, excepting the firſt and aſcending obliquely upwards, with an end partly fleſhy, and partly tendinous, it is <hi>inſerted</hi> into the Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula by the <hi>Proceſlus ancoriformis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to draw forward into the Breaſt.</p>
               <p>II. The ſecond is by <hi>Galen</hi> called <hi>Trapezius,</hi> others term it <hi>Cucullaris,</hi> becauſe it reſembles a Friars Cowl. But that this <hi>Muſcle</hi> was given our firſt Parents, as the Badge of a religious life, as <hi>Riolanus</hi> conjectures, I do not believe, becauſe others are religious that wear no Cowles, and many are irreligious that wear them, whether you look at their Profeſſion or Manners. However this Name was given this Muſcle by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Phyſitians, becauſe of its likeneſs to a Monks Cowl.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> fleſhy and thin from the hinder-part of the Head. From whence it deſcends to the eighth Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra of the Cheſt, and from thence as alſo from the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the Head growing ſmall by little and little, it is inſerted into the Back-bone, the Scapula, the top of the Shoulder and the Clavicula.</p>
               <p>But becauſe of its various Original and various Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</p>
               <p>It variouſly moves the Scapula, upwards, oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by reaſon of Fibres obliquely deſcending from the hind-part of the head to the Omoplata, which <hi>Riolanus</hi> denies in vain; downwards, by reaſon of the carriage of fibres, aſcending from the eighth Vertebra of the Back; and right out to the Back, by reaſon of right fibres in the middle of the Muſcle, ſtretched out to the Scapula.</p>
               <p>III. The third is the <hi>Rhomboides</hi> from its figure like a Diamond, ſcituate under the Cucullaris, thin and broad.</p>
               <p>It ariſes from the three lower Vertebra's of the Neck and the three upper Vertebra's of the Cheſt, and with, the ſame latitude is <hi>inſerted</hi> into the Baſis of the Scapula.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to draw back a little obliquely upwards.</p>
               <p>IV. Is the <hi>Levator,</hi> which others call the Muſcle of Patience; becauſe thoſe whoſe Affairs go croſs, are wont to lift up their Shoulders: it is above the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicula.</p>
               <p>It ariſes from the five tranſverſe Proceſſes of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra's of the Neck, with ſundry beginnings (which

makes it ſeem divers Muſcles) which ſoon grow into one: and its <hi>Inſertion</hi> is in the higher and lower cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Scapula, with a broad and fleſhy tendon. Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to draw forward and lift up the Scapula and the Humerus.</p>
               <p>With theſe Muſcles the Scapula is moved directly or of it ſelf, and the <hi>Brachium per accidens,</hi> accidentally; as the Scapula is accidentally moved by the Muſcles of the Brachium.</p>

               <p>VEry many Muſcles ſerve for Reſpiration; as the Midriff, all the Intercoſtal Muſcles, ſome of the Belly (of which I have treated in the firſt and ſecond Book) and ſome</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proper to the</hi> CHEST, which are reckoned <hi>on each ſide</hi> ſix; to which nevertheleſs <hi>Fallopius</hi> adds three in the Neck; which in <hi>Veſalius</hi> are parts of Muſcles poſſeſſing the Breaſt and Back.</p>
               <p>The proper <hi>Muſcles</hi> of the Cheſt do grow thereto: two in the forepart, <hi>ſubclavius</hi> and <hi>triangularis; Serra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus major</hi> poſſeſſes the Sides; the reſt are in the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, viz. the two <hi>Serrati poſtici</hi> and the <hi>Sacrolumbus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. The SUBCLAVIUS, becauſe 'tis ſeated under the Clavicula, fills the place between it and the firſt Rib. <hi>Platerus</hi> reckons it amongſt the Intercoſtals.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> fleſhy from the inner and lower part of the Clavicula: it is <hi>inſerted</hi> fleſhy into the upper part of the firſt Rib, which it draws upwards and outwards. And this is the firſt muſcle which dilates or diſtends the Cheſt. To this <hi>Spigelius</hi> aſſigns a contrary uſe, viz. to draw the Clavicula downwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which nevertheleſs is of it ſelf immoveable, and therefore he aſcribes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto a Riſe and an Inſertion contrary to it.</p>
               <p>II. The SERRATUS MAJOR, is a great, broad, and every way fleſhy muſcle, with the oblique deſcendent of the Abdomen, it makes a Saw-like Combination.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> fleſhy, from the internal Baſis of the Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la. <hi>Riolanus</hi> hath obſerved an higher Original there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, from the two upper Ribs, as far as to the Clavicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, which two Ribs ſeem immoveable. It is <hi>carried</hi> by its tendon, with five unequal ends, to the five true Ribs, and ſometimes to two baſtard Ribs; which it lifts up. <hi>Spigelius</hi> alſo and <hi>Veſlingus</hi> do aſcribe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Uſe hereunto, and conſequently a contrary Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and Inſertion,</p>
               <p>III. SERRATUS POSTICUS SUPERIOR <hi>minor,</hi> does quarter under the Rhomboides in the Back, between the two Shoulder-blades.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> membranous from the lower Spines of the Neck, and the firſt of the Back: it is <hi>inſerted</hi> into the three Intervals of the four upper Ribs, being tripar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite: and it draws thoſe Ribs upwards.</p>
               <p>IV. SERRATUS POSTICUS INFERIOR <hi>major,</hi> is membranons and broad almoſt in the middle of the Back, under the <hi>Muſculus latiſſimus</hi> or <hi>Ani ſcalptor ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> from the Spines or ſharp points of the lower Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra's of the Back. It is <hi>inſerted</hi> into the Intervals of the four lower Ribs, being parted as it were into Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Its <hi>Uſe</hi> to widen the lower part of the Cheſt.</p>
               <p>V. Is ſpred under the former, and by others ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be common to the Back and Cheſt. 'Tis call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed SACROLUMBUS, becauſe it <hi>ariſes</hi> from the lower part of Os ſacrum, and the ſharp points of the Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra's of the Loins. It is fleſhy within, nervous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. It is <hi>inſerted</hi> into the lower Ribs, with a double tendon, one external which is ſtrongeſt, the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. It is not eaſily ſeparated from the loweſt muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Back, ſo that it ſeems to be a parcel thereof. Its <hi>Uſe</hi> according to <hi>Veſlingus,</hi> to contract the Cheſt. <hi>Spigelius</hi> conceives as I do, that becauſe it grows out of one beginning with the <hi>Muſculus longiſſimus</hi> of the Back, that therefore it extends and raiſes up the Cheſt.</p>
               <p>VI. Is the TRIANGULARIS, ſmall and ſubtile, in lean perſons ſcarce fleſhy, it lies inwardly concealed under the Breaſt-bone, out of the lower part whereof, it hath its <hi>Original.</hi> And therefore it may convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called the Muſcle of the Breaſt-bone. Its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely <hi>inſerted</hi> into the lower Griſtles, which it draws to, and ſtraitens the Cheſt.</p>

It is turned round upon the tooth-faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Proceſs of the ſecond Vertebra (on which the hind-part of the Head reſts, and to which it is firmly faſtned) as it were upon an Axle-tree; which motion is performed by nine pare of Muſcles.</p>
               <p>The firſt pare is <hi>long</hi> and thick, by ſome called <hi>Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> ſpred out on each ſide upon the Vertebrae. It <hi>ariſes</hi> from a double beginning, one from the Spinae of the upper Vertebra's of the Cheſt, another from the five lower Spinae of the Vertebra's of the Neck, from which it is carried to the middle of the Occiput. Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to draw the Head directly backwards. But if only one do act, the motion is thought to be made circularly to one ſide.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is implicated and complicated, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore termed <hi>Complexum.</hi> It ſeems to conſiſt as it were of three Muſcles. It hath divers beginnings, at the ſeventh Vertebra of the Neck, at the firſt, third and fourth of the Cheſt, and it is after a different manner implanted into the Occiput.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Riolanus</hi> obſerves touching the Fibres of the <hi>Spleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> and the <hi>Complexus,</hi> that they are croſs-wayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſected, and diſpoſed for the ſtrength of both the Muſcles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third Pare</hi> is ſcituate under the ſecond, <hi>ſmall</hi> and thick, which <hi>Veſalius</hi> would have to be the fourth part of the former Muſcle. It is <hi>inſerted</hi> into the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Root of the <hi>Proceſſus mammillaris</hi> Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is, lightly to bring the Head backwards; and if but one act, to bring it backwards to one ſide.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> pare is called <hi>Rectum majus,</hi> being ſmall, fleſhy and lean. It <hi>ariſes</hi> from the ſecond Vertebra of the Neck; <hi>ends</hi> into the middle of the Occiput.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fift</hi> pare called <hi>Rectum minus,</hi> lies concealed under the former pare. Its <hi>Riſe</hi> is from the firſt Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra of the Neck, its inſertion and <hi>Uſe</hi> is as of the third and fourth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſixt</hi> is the <hi>Obliquum ſuperius,</hi> which lies alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. It <hi>riſes</hi> according to ſome, out of the middle of the Occiput, and deſcending is inſerted athwart, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the points of the Proceſſes of the Neck. But others among whom <hi>Veſlingus</hi> do rightly think it ariſes from the Proceſs of the firſt Vertebra, and ends into the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciput<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:41352:89"/>
by the outward ſide of the Recti.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſeventh</hi> called <hi>Obliquum inferius, ariſes</hi> from the ſecond Vertebra of the Neck, and is <hi>inſerted</hi> into the tranſverſe Proceſs of the firſt Vertebra.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of the two oblique Muſcles, is to bring the Head about to the Sides.</p>
               <p>The <hi>eighth</hi> called <hi>Maſtoides, ariſes</hi> long and round in the forepart of the Neck, for the moſt part double, from the upper part of the Breſt-bone and the Clavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula: it is <hi>inſerted</hi> with a fleſhy and thick End, into the Mammillary Proceſs, which it embraces. Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to turn the Head.</p>
               <p>A <hi>ninth</hi> pare is added by <hi>Fallopius,</hi> under the Throat, in the forepart of the Neck, lying near the firſt pare of the Neck. It <hi>ariſes</hi> nervous from the Ligaments of the Vertebra's of the Neck; and is <hi>inſerted</hi> into the Baſis of the Head, which it turns in like manner with the former.</p>

               <p>THe Muſcles of the Neck are on each ſide <hi>four.</hi> The two firſt extend, the two others do bend the ſame.</p>
               <p>I. The two LONG ONES lye hid under the Oeſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus or Gullet, ariſing from the firſt Vertebra of the Cheſt, with a beginning fleſhy and ſharp, they aſcend into the extuberant Proceſs of the firſt Vertebra, with an acute tendon, and ſometimes are inſerted into the Occiput, near its great Hole.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to bend the Neck right forwards and the Head withal: and if but one act, it turns it on the one ſide.</p>
               <p>The SCALENI ſo called, which ſome count Muſcles of the Cheſt, have a peculiar Hole, through which Veins and Arteries enter into the Arms. They <hi>ariſe</hi> fleſhy, at the ſide of the Neck, from the firſt Rib; they are <hi>inſerted</hi> inwardly into all the Vertebra's for the moſt part of the Neck, and eſpecially into their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Proceſſes.</p>
               <p>III. The TRANSVERSALES <hi>duo,</hi> ſeated in the back, <hi>do riſe from</hi> the ſix Vertebra's of the Cheſt which are uppermoſt and outmoſt: they are <hi>inſerted</hi> externally into all the tranſverſe Proceſſes of the Vertebra's of the Neck. And between theſe Nerves go out. Their <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to extend or to bend backwards, but if one act alone, to move obliquely.</p>
               <p>IV. The two SPINATI poſſeſs the whole Neck be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Spinae, and are long and large. They <hi>ariſe</hi> from five Spines of the Vertebra's of the Neck, and ſeven of the Cheſt. They are ſtrongly <hi>implanted</hi> into the whole lower part of the Spine of the ſecond Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra. Their <hi>Uſe</hi> is the ſame as of the third pare.</p>

               <p>The Muſcles of the Cubit are <hi>four,</hi> and of the RA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIUS as many.</p>
               <p>There are two Benders of the Cubit, as the <hi>Biceps</hi> and <hi>Brachiaeus:</hi> two Extenders, viz. the <hi>Longus</hi> and the <hi>Brevis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two Pronators of the Radius, the <hi>Rotun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> and the <hi>Quadratus,</hi> and two Supinators, the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gior</hi> and <hi>Brevior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the proper Motion of the Cubit is flexion and extenſion. But the Radius makes the whole Arm prone or ſupine.</p>
               <p>The firſt of the Cubit is termed BICEPS; becauſe of its double diſtinct <hi>Beginning,</hi> which is from the Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, the one tendinous and round, from the upper lie of the Acerabulum, the other broader and leſs tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, from the <hi>Proceſſus ancoriformis.</hi> And it is <hi>inſerted</hi> with the Head of the Radius, and poſſeſſes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner part of the Arm with its Body. The tendon of this Muſcle ought in Blood-letting to be taken heed of.</p>
               <p>The ſecond lying under this, and ſpred out upon the bone it ſelf, being ſhort, is called BRACHIAEUS; 'tis all fleſhy, leſs then the former; <hi>artſes</hi> from the middle bone of the Brachium, and is before <hi>inſerted</hi> into the common beginning of the Cubitus and Radius, and the Ligament of the Joynt.</p>
               <p>The third is the EXTENDENS <hi>primus</hi> and LONGUS, it <hi>ariſes</hi> with a double beginning, from the lower Rib of the Scapula, is ended being fleſhy in the Olecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the EXTENDENS <hi>ſecundus</hi> and BRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIS; it <hi>ariſes</hi> from the Neck of the Humerus, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind mixed with the precedent, and occupies the <hi>Os Humeri;</hi> and it ends into the part of the Olecranum on which we lean.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſſerius</hi> adds a fift called <hi>tertius extendens,</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers count a portion of the fourth Muſcle; but he counts it a diſtinct Muſcle, as later Anatomiſts <hi>Riola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Veſlingus</hi> do, which they term <hi>Anconeus.</hi> But he would have it to be a portion of his <hi>Brachiaeus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſticks ſometimes cloſe to the fleſhy Extremity thereof, and to anſwer to the <hi>Poplitaeus,</hi> that an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be maintained between the foot and the hand. It ſprings out of the hinder extremity of the Shoulder, by the end of the fourth and third Muſcle, and paſſing beyond the Joynt of the Cubir, it is alſo <hi>inſerted</hi> by its hinder and lateral part, yet not above a fingers bredth beyond the Olecranum, into the <hi>Os Cubiti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover <hi>Galen</hi> ſeems to add a ſixt, which is the fourth Extender, viz. a fleſhy Lump hudled up of the two former, which <hi>Riolanus</hi> calls <hi>Brachiaeus externus,</hi> to difference it from the <hi>Brachiaeus intern is flectens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being ſpred out upon the outſide of the Brachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, it is placed under the two former.</p>
               <p>The firſt Muſcle of the Radius is termed ROTUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DUS, or <hi>Teres;</hi> from the inner Apophyſis of the Arm by a ſtrong and fleſhy beginning, it ends obliquely ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near into the middle of the Radius, with a fleſhy end, and likewiſe a membranous tendon, which <hi>Spige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> writes, does go again to the middle of the Radius, and is knit to the outward ſide of the ſaid Radius.</p>
               <p>The ſecond QUADRATUS, reaching from the loweſt part of the Cubita, into the loweſt of the Radiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, wholly fleſhy, every where two fingers broad; it goes above that Ligament common to the Radius and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitus. Theſe are the <hi>Manus pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The third is the SUPINATOR PRIMUS, from the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer part of the Brachium growing ſharp, till it reach into the lower part of the Radius, fleſhy, where it is <hi>inſerted</hi> with a tendinous End.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the SUPINATOR ALTER, growing from the outward Apophyſis of the Arm, fleſhy, membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous without, fleſhy within, and is <hi>inſerted</hi> into the middle wel-near of the Radius.</p>
               <p>Among the Muſcles of the Radius <hi>Caſſerius</hi> once found two little ones, and very ſmall, about the Joynt Cubit, and proceeding in an oppoſite faſhion, and moving the Radius Prone and Supine like a Pulley. Howbeit, I found them not as yet. I have ſomtimes ſeen in their place, in a muſculous man, one <hi>triangular</hi>

Muſcle, ariſing from the top of the Shoulder, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the middle of the ſame, with a fleſhy and narrow end, nor was it the portion of any Muſcle, all which we had before diligently ſeparated.</p>

               <p>To this they add the <hi>Membrana carnoſa</hi> which they will have to open the Palm of the Hand when it is contracted; alſo a <hi>four ſqua e Parcel</hi> of <hi>Fleſh</hi> growing out of that Membrane, reſembling certain Muſcles; either to extend the Palm when the Hand is open, as <hi>Spige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> conceives, or to make it hollow, which <hi>Riolanus</hi> would have.</p>

                  <hi>Iacobus Silvius</hi> reckons the <hi>Extenſores</hi> for one Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; and calls it Tenſor Digitorum, whereas both their Originals and Inſertions do vary. They are two and ariſe commonly from the external Apophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fis of the Arm, and the ring-faſhioned ligament, and with their bored ligaments, being firſt collected, they are then <hi>inſerted</hi> confuſedly into the ſecond and third joynt.</p>
               <p>The Fingers are drawn to by four muſcles called <hi>Lumbricales</hi> or <hi>Vermiculares</hi> worm-faſhioned muſcles, from their ſhape and ſmallneſs. They ariſe from the tendons of the <hi>Muſculus profundus,</hi> and being drawn out along the ſides of the fingers, they are obliquely carried unto the third joynting. <hi>Spigelius</hi> and <hi>Veſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> will have them to be inſerted by a round tendon only into the firſt joynting, whom I have ſomtimes found to be in the right, their tendon being mixed with the membranes of the interjuncture.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Abductores interoſſei</hi> are ſix, in the ſpaces of the Metacarp, three external and three internal, which joyning with the vermiculary do go along the outſides and inſides of the fingers, and ſtretch their tendons to the three inter-joyntings. They ſerve in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for extenſion. The <hi>External</hi> reſt upon the Palm, the <hi>Internal</hi> upon the hollow of the Hand, between the bones of the Metacarp.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſcles</hi> which bend the <hi>Thumb</hi> are two.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>ariſing</hi> from the upper part of the radius is inſerted into one of the joynts.</p>
               <p>The other <hi>ariſing</hi> from the wriſt bone, under the Thumb, is <hi>inſerted</hi> into the middle of the ſaid Thumb. It lies wholly under the former.</p>
               <p>There are two <hi>Extendentes</hi> or ſtretchers out, which ariſe from the Cubit. The firſt reaches unto the third Interjuncture, the other unto the ſecond, and the reſt, with many tendons; ſometimes one, ſometimes two, and otherwhiles three.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Abducentes</hi> are three; two ariſing from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacarpium, and the third from the bone of the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp, which looks towards the forefinger: which <hi>Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi> calls <hi>Autithenar,</hi> as the other the former of the bringers to, <hi>Hypothenar Pollicis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Abducentes</hi> or drawers away are three nameleſs muſcles, ſave that the ſaid <hi>Riolanus</hi> calls one of them <hi>Thenar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Forefinger</hi> has two proper muſcles, which ſome confound, the firſt is the Abductor, ariſing from the firſt Interjoynting of the Thumb, and terminated into the bones of the Forefinger, wherewith the ſaid Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger is drawn from the reſt of the Fingers, towards the Thumb.</p>
               <p>The other is the <hi>Indicis extenſor</hi> the ſtretcher of the Forefinger which <hi>Riolanus</hi> calls <hi>Indicatorem</hi> the point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as alſo <hi>Veſlingus,</hi> though he confound it with the Abductor. It <hi>ariſes</hi> from the middle and external part of the Cubit, and <hi>ends</hi> with a double tendon, into the ſecond interjointure of the forefinger.</p>
               <p>There are alſo two muſcles proper to the ſmalleſt finger, the <hi>Abductor</hi> and <hi>Extenſor.</hi> The former may be parted into many: It ariſes in the hollow of the hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the third and fourth wriſt bones of the ſecond rank, and ends externally into the ſide of the firſt joint of the ſaid finger. <hi>Aquapendent</hi> and others that have ſince followed him, do hold that it draws the little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger outwardly, from the reſt. <hi>Extenſor proprius,</hi> which <hi>Riolanus</hi> exactly ſeperates from the great one, <hi>ariſing</hi> from the upper part of the radius, and carryed along Cubitus and the Radius, is externally inſerted into the finger, with a double tendon,</p>

For one Leg being firmly ſet upon the ground, we move and bring about the other, and our Foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmly fixt, keeps us from falling: and ſo we come to walk. The ſetting therefore of our Leg is the Motion of the whole Body, but the motion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Leg, which the length or ſhortneſs of the Leg does either help or hinder; and therefore birds becauſe they were to flie, that their bulk might not hinder them, they have a ſhort Thigh and long Feet, which makes the going be ſlow. But Men go ſlower then Dogs, bcauſe the ſucceſſive putting on of their Foot from the Heel to the Toes, ſlackens their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereas Dogs with one motion of their little Feet do paſs along.

               <p>THe <hi>Thigh</hi> is <hi>bended</hi> by two Muſcles.</p>
               <p>The firſt is in the Belly, and is termed <hi>Pſoa</hi> or the <hi>Muſculus Lumbaris</hi> it ariſes with a fleſhy beginning from the upper Vertebraes of the Loins, and is <hi>inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> into the forepart of the ſmall Trochanter, with a round and ſtrong tendon.</p>
               <p>The other muſcle called <hi>Pſoas</hi> minor I found in a ſtrong fleſhy body at <hi>Hafnia,</hi> 1651. differing from that which <hi>Riolanus</hi> brags to have ſeen. For the greater part i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ay under, but outwardly inclined more to the ſides. The <hi>beginning</hi> was fleſhy, and the whole muſcle was three fingers broad. It was <hi>inſerted</hi> fleſhy, into the upper brim of Os Ilij backwards, where the <hi>Iliacus internus</hi> ariſes. I conceived that its <hi>uſe</hi> was to ſpread as a pillow under the greater muſcle, becauſe the Os Ilij is of it ſelf immoveable, or to hold the Os Ilij upright, that it might not burthen a man too much when he ſtands. <hi>Michael Lyſerus</hi> a moſt expert Anatomiſt can witneſs the ſame with me.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ilia us ſecundus</hi> is inſerted in the ſame place, with a tendon which grows to the tendon of the precedent muſcle, <hi>ariſing</hi> from the whole internal cavity of the Os Ilij, by a ſmall and fleſhy beginning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:41352:95"/>The Thigh is extended by three muſcles of the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks termed <hi>Glutaei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. Is the <hi>Major, externus &amp; ampliſſimus,</hi> beginning at the Crupper, the ſpina of Os Ilij, and the Os ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum; and ends into the Os Femoris, under the great Trochanter.</p>
               <p>II. The other is the <hi>medius</hi> or middlemoſt in Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Magnitude. It ariſes from the inner ſide of the Spina of Os Ilij, ending into this great Trochanter with a broad and ſtrong tendon.</p>
               <p>III. The third called <hi>minimus</hi> the ſmalleſt, lies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed under the middlemoſt; It <hi>ariſes</hi> from the back of Os Ilij near the Acetabulum with a broad and ſtrong tendon, and <hi>Ends</hi> into the great Trochanter.</p>
               <p>Theſe three do make up the fleſhy Subſtance of the Buttocks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Thigh is drawn to, and wheeled about inwards</hi> by three muſcles, which many do reckon for one, and call it <hi>triceps</hi> triple headed, becauſe of its threefold begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. 1. Is from the upper joynting of the Os pubis. 2. Is from the loweſt joynting of Os pubis. 3. Is from the middle part of the ſaid bone. They are <hi>inſerted</hi> firſt of all into the inner head of the Thigh bone, near the Ham, with a round tendon or into the rough line of the Thigh. 2. To the upper, partly. 3. Partly to the lower, at the Rorator minor. <hi>Riolanus</hi> has other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions: For he will have the firſt to be inſerted into the middle of the Thigh, the ſecond to be produced with a very ſtrong Tendon as far as to the End of the Thigh, the third below the neck of the Thigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.</p>
               <p>To theſe <hi>Spigelius</hi> and <hi>Veſlingus</hi> do add one which they call <hi>Lividus</hi> ariſing at the joyning of Os pubis, near the Griſtle, and implanted with a ſhort tendon, into the inner ſide of the thigh: but they grant that this is a portion of the Triceps. But they do ill to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon it among the bending Muſcles. But <hi>Riolanus</hi> calls it <hi>Pectineus</hi> and reckons it for a bender, yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that it is the uppermoſt and fourth portion of the triceps, which with <hi>Fallopius</hi> he divides into four Muſcles, and indeed it ſeems to have ſo many parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is drawn away and turned about outwards by ſix</hi> Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Quadrigemini</hi> and the two <hi>Obturatores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Quadrigemini</hi> are in a manner one like another, and little, placed as it were athwart, <hi>ariſing</hi> from the lower and outer part of the Os Sacrum, the bunch of Os Iſchij, and the Appendix of the Hip-bone. They are <hi>inſerted</hi> into that ſpace which is between the two Trochanters. The firſt Quadrigeminus is called <hi>Pyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formis</hi> Pear-faſhioned, becauſe of its ſhape, and <hi>Iliaeus externus</hi> from its Scituation; the reſt want names, ſave the fourth, which is called <hi>Quadratus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Obturatores</hi> ſtoppers, take up the wide hole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Os pubis and Os Iſehij. And they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or internal, the former ariſing from the outer Circle of the hole of the ſhare: the latter from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and they are inſerted into the great Trochanter: the inner may be termed <hi>Burſalis</hi> or purſe-faſhioned becauſe it hides the fourfold tendons in a fleſhy purſe as it were, nearly ſhaped by the third and fourth qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigeminal Muſcles.</p>

               <p>The ſecond called <hi>Semimembranoſus ariſes</hi> from the ſwelling of the Iſchium, and is inſerted into the inner ſide of the Leg, backwards.</p>
               <p>The third is the <hi>Seminervoſus,</hi> and has the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and the ſame end with the former, ſave that in the hinder parts it is carried little forward obliquely, before it terminates at the inſide of the Leg.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the <hi>Gracilis,</hi> which is inſerted into the ſame place, and ariſes from the joyning of the ſhare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Four</hi> Muſcles <hi>extend</hi> the Leg.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the <hi>Rectus,</hi> ariſing with an acute tendon from the outer and lower Spine of the Ilium.</p>
               <p>The ſecond and third are the two Vaſti, the <hi>external</hi> ariſing from the whole root, the great Trochanters, and the bone of the Thigh which lies under: the <hi>Inner</hi> from the ſmall Trochanter: they are terminated on each hand at the ſide of the <hi>Rectus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth is the <hi>Crureus,</hi> fixed to the Thigh bone, as the <hi>Brachiaeus</hi> is to the Brachium.</p>
               <p>Theſe four Muſcles, are <hi>terminated</hi> into one tendon, which embracing the ſubſtance of the fleſh into it ſelf, it is inſerted before into the beginning of the Leg, and is there inſtead of a Ligament for it.</p>
               <p>Two Muſcles, pul it to, inwards.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the <hi>longus, faſcialis</hi> or <hi>ſartorius</hi> which <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelius</hi> and <hi>Veſlingus</hi> reckon among the benders, on which Tailors or Borchers reſt themſelves when they ſit croſs-leg'd.

               <p>The other is the <hi>Popliteus ariſing</hi> from the lower and outer extuberancy of the Thigh, and being <hi>inſerted</hi> four-ſquare into the inner and upper part of the leg ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely.</p>

The <hi>Minor</hi> anſwering to the ſublimis, is the midſt of the ſole of the foot, <hi>ariſing</hi> from the lower part of the pterna or heel bone, it is carried into the ſecond articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the four toes, to which before it comes it is bored thorough, that it may tranſmit the tendons of the foremoſt Muſcle: and therefore this is called per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foratus, the other perforans.</p>
               <p>One muſcle <hi>extends</hi> the four toes of the foot, which is by ſome divided into two; ariſing from the upper and outer part of the tibia, and having four tendons, which are inſerted into the ſecond and third Interjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>

               <p>The ten <hi>Interoſſei</hi> do draw them away, <hi>ariſing</hi> from the bones of the pedium, and falling the void ſpaces of the Metapedium, they are external or internal, the former with a broad tendon do ariſe by the ſides, to the firſt interjoynting of the toes by the ſides; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the ſecond interjoynting: but the ninth <hi>ſerves</hi> for the drawing-to of the great Toe, the tenth for the drawing to of the little toe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>great Toe</hi> has peculiar muſcles.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>bent</hi> by one only, proceeding from the upper part of the fibula, and inſerted into the third interjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (<hi>Riolanus</hi> ſayes the firſt) of the great toe.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>extended</hi> by another, ariſing from the middle of the Fibula (or as ſome ſay from the outſide of the tibia, where it recedes from the Fibula) which is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times divided into two tendons.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>brought</hi> to, with one, inwardly faſtned to the greateſt bone of the pedium.</p>

               <p>Now there is a <hi>new muſcle</hi> found out above the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teroſſeans, the firſt Inventor whereof is <hi>Caſſerius;</hi> who calls it <hi>tranverſalis,</hi> becauſe of its ſituation. <hi>Veſlingus</hi> call it the <hi>Adductor pollicis minor,</hi> which uſe nature ſeems to have intended.</p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> nervous and broad, from the ligament of the firſt interjuncture of the little Toe, and ſometime from one of the toes next the little toe; and by and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming fleſhy and ſo continuing, it is carried athwart over the firſt joints of the fingers, and with a ſhort and broad tendon, it is <hi>implanted</hi> into the firſt joynt of the Great-toe, a little inwards.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> hereof is, to ſecure our walking, when we paſs through rough wayes, full of round flints, or over any other ſmall, ſlippery, or rowling paſſage. For by help of this muſcle, the foot does accommodate it ſelf, to the figure of the Bodies we tread on, and layes hold thereon as it were, that it might make its paſſage more ſtead-faſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Abductor</hi> of the little toe, ſticking in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the foot broad and vaſt, ariſing from the ſame part of the heel, is inſerted into the outſide of the firſt Interjuncture.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved a peculiar <hi>bender</hi> of the little toe, long, round, ariſing from the head of the Tibia, and divided with two tendons about the inſertion of the toe.</p>
               <p>Finally a <hi>fleſhy maſs</hi> is to be obſerved in the ſole of the foot, as well as in the Palm of the hand, wherewith our footing is faſtened as with a cuſhion, and the tendons of the muſcles do lie hidden, in a ſoft Pillow.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Veins, Arteries</hi> and <hi>Nerves</hi> are Organs or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon veſſels of the Body, through which ſome ſpirit, with or without Blood, is carried from ſome principal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, into ſundry parts of the Body.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>AVein</hi> is a common Organ, round, long,<note place="margin">What a Vein is?</note> hollow like a channel or Conduit pipe, fit to carry or bring back Blood and Natural Spirit.</p>
               <p>The term <hi>Vein</hi> was by the <hi>Ancients</hi> given both to Veins and Arteries; but they cal'd the Arteries pulſing Veins, and the Veins not pulſing Veins, and ſome called Vein, the greater Vein, and an Artery the leſſer Vein and the <hi>Aorta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Efficient</hi> of a Vein, is the proper vein-making po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer or faculty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Matter</hi> according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is a clammy and cold portion of the Seed. And this is the principle of a Veins Original.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Principle</hi> of Diſpenſation<note place="margin">'Tis proved againſt <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> that the Liver, not the Heart is the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Veins.</note> from whence the Veins ariſe, is the <hi>Liver</hi> (not to ſpeak of ſome anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent triflers, who would derive the Veins from the Brain) and not the Heart, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would have it. For,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Blood is made in the Liver. And<note place="margin">Blood is not made in the Heart.</note> therefore 'tis like the original and riſe of the Veins is there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the firſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſication is not made in the Heart is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, becauſe there are no paſſages to conveigh the Chylus to the Heart; again there are no receptacles for the Excrements of the firſt concoction placed by the Heart. But all theſe requiſites are found in the Liver.</item>
                  <item>2. Blood is carried from the Liver to the Heart, but not from the Heart immediately to the Liver. For Blood cannot go out of the Heart into the Liver, becauſe of the Valves; though mediately when it runs back out of the Arteries, it may be carried thither.</item>
                  <item>3. Fiſhes have no right Ventricle in their Hearts, in which they would have Blood to be made; and out of which they would have the Veins to ariſe, and the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es have both Veins and Blood.</item>
                  <item>4. The <hi>Vena portae</hi> touches not the Heart but the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which the <hi>Cava</hi> alſo touches: which two Veins are the greateſt in the whole body. But according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:41352:97"/>
all Veins ought to be continued with the Heart. You wil ſay; the <hi>Vena arterioſa</hi> does not touch the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. I anſwer, neither ought if ſo to do: becauſe it hath the ſubſtance of an Artery, and therefore ariſes from the Heart. But <hi>Arteria Venoſa,</hi> is a Vein in ſubſtance and uſe, and in the Child in the womb, was continued with the <hi>Cava.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. In the Child in the womb, the Navil-vein with Blood goes into the Liver, not into the Heart.</item>
                  <item>6. If the Veins ſhould ariſe from the Heart, they would pulſe as the Arteries do, for the whole Heart pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</item>
                  <item>7. Sanguification is never hurt, but when the Liver is hurt, as in a Dropſie, &amp;c.</item>

               <p>And that they bring the Blood to the Heart as to the Centre, and that they bring it from the ſmalleſt parts as from the Circumference, is evidently provided by ocular Inſpection, Experiments, and Reaſon.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In Blood-letting, the Arm being bound above the Elbow, beyond the Ligature, the Vein ſwels not, nor if you ſhould open a Vein would the Blood flow out (which is to be obſerved in oppoſition to the Authority of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonius Largu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>) unleſs very little, or if there were ſome Anaſtomoſis of a Vein, with an Artery in ſome parts above. But on this ſide the Ligature under the Elbow, both the Veins of the Arm ſwel, and being opened they void as much Blood as you wil, yea all that is in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Likewiſe if with your finger you preſs the Vein below the Orifice, the blood ſtops, if you take away your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it runs again: whence we gather that the blood runs from the outmoſt ſmall Veins of the body upwards unto the great Veins and the Heart; and not from the upper and greater Veins into the lower, ſmaller, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.</item>
                  <item>2. Without Blood-letting, the Veins being preſſed with the finger ſhew as much: for if in an Arm either hot, or whoſe Veins naturally ſwell, you force the blood downwards with your finger towards the fingers, there follows no blood in the upper part of the Vein, but it appears empty. Contrariwiſe, if you force the blood from the Fingers-ward upwards, you ſhall preſently ſee the Veins full, more blood following that which you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced up.</item>
                  <item>3. If you ſhall plunge your Arms and Legs into cold Water or Snow, being firſt bound, when you unbind the ſame, you ſhal perceive your Heart offended and made cold, by the cold blood aſcending thereunto; and it will be warmed if you put your Legs or Arms as aforeſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hot water. Nor is it any other way by which cordiall Epithems applied to the Wriſts and Privities do good.</item>
                  <item>4. In perſons that are hanged, their Heads and Faces become red, the Veins being diſtended, becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Blood into the Heart i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> hindred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the Veins of the Head, the upper parts in the Head ſwell, the other parts towards the Heart being emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But the Halter being looſed from the dead body, the ſwelling and redneſs of the Face does fall by little and little, unleſs the Blood which is forced into the ſmalleſt Veins cannot run back again becauſe of the coldneſs of the parts.</item>
                  <item>5. In Diſſections of Live-Animals, the matter is moſt evident. For in what part of the body ſoever you bind a Vein, it appears lank and empty on that ſide of the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture next the Heart, and on the other ſide it ſwels where it is furtheſt from the Heart, and neereſt the extream parts of the Body.</item>
                  <item>6. In a living Anatomy, if you lift up a Vein and open it being tied, beyond the Ligature plenty of Blood flows out, on this ſide nothing at all, which you ſhall find true in the crural and jugular Veins of any Creature whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though you cut the Veins quite in ſunder, as I have often experimented with the great <hi>Walaeus,</hi> and <hi>Harvey</hi> was not ignorant thereof.</item>
                  <item>7, The Valves of the Veins do conſpire to this end, which are ſo contrived, that they ſtand all wide open to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Heart, and afford an eaſie paſſage from the ſmalleſt Veins to the greateſt, and from thence to the Heart. But from the Heart and great Veins, being ſhut they ſuffer nothing to go back, no not Water driven by force, or a Probe, unleſs being hurt they gape.</item>
                  <item>8. The Liver ſends only to the Heart; the Heart only to the Lungs, and all the Arteries; as hath been already demonſtrated concerning the Heart. Seeing therefore the Blood by continual pulſation is ſent in ſo great quantity in all parts, and yet cannot be repaired by Diet, nor can return back to the Heart by reaſon of the Miter-faſhioned Valves of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> nor abide ſtil in the Arteries which are continually driving the ſame, nor fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally is there ſo much ſpent by the parts to be nouriſhed; it follows, that what remains over and above is brought back again to the heart, and enters the Veins by Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Whereof although ſome dark Footſteps are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the writings of the Ancients, as I have proved in my Book <hi>de Luce Animalium,</hi> and <hi>Walaeus</hi> and <hi>Riolanus</hi> do afterward declare the ſame at large; yet it hath been more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </list>
               <p>The <hi>Primary</hi> End therefore of the Veins is to carry and recarry Blood unto the Heart the <hi>ſecondary</hi> ends may be theſe following.</p>
               <p>II. A little to prepare the ſaid Blood,<note place="margin">Their ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> as do the <hi>Rami Lactei,</hi> or to finiſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the ſame, as a ſmall portion of <hi>Vena Cavae</hi> between the Liver and the Heart.</p>
               <p>III. To perſerve the Blood, as the proper place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that which is placed therein, as much as may be in a ſpeedy paſſage, and to retain it within its bounds. For extravenated Blood, or Blood out of its natural place, <hi>viz.</hi> Veins and Arteries, curdles and putrefies. Alſo in the Veins themſelves, when they are ill affected, and the courſe of the Blood is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtopped, ſomtimes the Blood is found congealed, witneſs <hi>Fernelius:</hi> ſomtimes a fatty ſubſtance is found inſtead of Blood, as in the Nerves, which <hi>Bontius</hi> ſaw among the Indians.</p>
               <p>IV. Some would have the red veins to make Blood, and the milkie veins to make Chyle, but they are quite miſtaken.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Form</hi> of the Veins is taken from ſundry Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:41352:97"/>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is that of a Conduit pipe.<note place="margin">Figure.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Its <hi>Magnitude</hi> varies. For the Veins are great in the Livet, as in their Original; in the<note place="margin">Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude.</note> Lungs becauſe they are hot, ſoft, and in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual motion, and thereſote they need much nouriſhment, becauſe much of their ſubſtance ſpends; but eſpecially becauſe all the Blood in the Body paſſes this way, out of the right into the left Venrricle of the Heart, as hath been proved already. In the Heart by reaſon of its heat, and becauſe it is to furniſh the whole Body with Arterial Blood, received in and ſent out by continual pulſings. Alſo the emulgent Veins are great, by reaſon of plenty of blood and ſeroſities, which is brought back from the Kidnies to the <hi>Vena Cava.</hi> But where the ſubſtance of a part is laſting, and is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſipated, by reaſon of the ſmal quantity of Heat, the Veins are leſſer as in the Brain, where the Veins do not alwaies eaſily appear, and in the Bones, where they never manifeſtly appear, though the Animal be great.</p>
               <p>In all parts towards the ends they are very ſmall, and are divided into Capillary Veins, ſprinkled into, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly confounded with the fleſh, that the ſuperfluous Blood may be better received into them; which is <hi>one</hi> way, by which the Arterial Blood is mediately paſſed through the porous fleſh to the Veins, which way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Blood made of Chyle in the Liver, is infuſed into the little branches of the <hi>Venae Cava.</hi> The <hi>other</hi> is, by the Arteries immediately. For,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Connexion</hi> is ſuch with the Arteries, that every Vein is for the moſt part attended<note place="margin">Connexion.</note> with an Artery, over which it lies and which it touches. <hi>Gale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> tels us a a Vein is ſeldom found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arteries; but no Artery is ever found without a Vein.</p>
               <p>But there is in the Body a mutual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtomoſis of Veins and Arteries: that<note place="margin">Anaſtomoſis of Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</note> they may conſpire together, and the Veins receive out of the Arteries Spirit &amp; Blood; which is apparent from reaſon, becauſe, 1. If the Veins be quite emptied, the Arteries are empty alſo. Moreover out of a Vein opened in the Arm or Hand, all the Blood in the Body may be let out, which, becauſe it cannot be contained or generated in the Hand, it muſt neceſſarily come out of the Arteries beneath and round about, by means of the Anaſtomoſes: whereof this alſo is a token, that if the Vein and Artery of the Arm be tied very hard, the Blood ceaſes running and the pulſe ſtops it beating, til the band be ſlackned. 2. They are neceſſary in reſpect of the Circular motion of the blood, ſeeing the pores of the Fleſh are not ſufficient, ſave in a ſlow courſe, and ſubtile Blood.</p>
               <p>Moreover they may be demonſtrated in many places to the Eye-ſight, where the Conjunctions of the Veins with the Arteries are viſible, viz. in the Brain, in the <hi>Plexus Chorides,</hi> the Cavities, in the Lungs of the <hi>Vena Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſa.</hi> and the <hi>Arteria Venoſa,</hi> with the Branches of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> or Weſand. Of the Thoracick branches deſcending, with the intercoſtal Veins. Alſo the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogaſtrick Veins and Arteries, with the Mammary veſſels are joyned mouth to mouth under the <hi>Muſculi Recti</hi> in the Abdomen. But the Anaſtomoſes or mutual conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the mouths of the <hi>Cava</hi> and <hi>Portae</hi> in the Liver, and of the Veins and Arteries in the Spleen, are in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner manifeſt; ſo in the Veins of the Womb, the ſeminary veſſels, the Navil-ſtrings, and the extemities of the Hands and Feet.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Anaſtomoſes</hi> or conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions<note place="margin">Anaſtomoſes of the Veins in the Liver.</note> of veſſels, are in reaſon neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and manifeſt to the Eye-ſight, yet are they not all <hi>manifeſtly diſcernable</hi> by the Sight.. I made experiment in the Liver of an Ox and of a Man, diligently ſeparating all the ſubſtance from the veſſels; yet could I not either with a Probe, or a Knife, or a pair of Bellows find the <hi>Anaſtomoſes</hi> of <hi>Vena Cavae</hi> and <hi>Vena Porta</hi> open, but all blind, in dead bodies, though it is not to be doubted, but that they are open in in living bodies, where all the paſſages are inlarged by Heat.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But where a Vein is inſerted either into ſome Bowell or a Muſcle, it needs not this common coat, becauſe 1. It is otherwiſe ſufficiently ſuſteined. 2.

               <p>THe <hi>Subſtance of the Veins</hi> is Membranous, that they may more eaſily ſtretch and ſhrink in again.</p>
               <p>They have only one <hi>Coat,</hi> which is proper to them (the Arteries have two) being thin and rare; becauſe through it the blood is to be received after the parts are nouriſhed. it carries not back ſuch ſtirring and hot blood as the Arteries carry; becauſe it is grown cold and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns quietly to the Heart without any beating of the Pulſe that it may be there again perfected.</p>
               <p>Some conceive that a Vein is interwoven<note place="margin">Whether the Veins have Fibres.</note> with a triple kind of Fibres: but they ad, that thoſe fibres are there obſcurely, and only potentially, nor can be moved out of their place, by reaſon of the moſt ſtrait contexture. But I rather conceive with <hi>Veſalius,</hi> that others imagin Fibres to be there, which are no more there than in Leather. for when we pull the ſubſtance of the Reins all in pieces, no fibres are there to be ſeen. But ſome Authors attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute fibres to the Veins, becauſe they have praeconceived this opinion, that Attraction, Expulſion and Retention are performed by ſundry ſorts of fibres, whenas the fibres if they have any are to ſtrengthen them.</p>

Yea, and it may be driven by the blood continually following, from the parts and Arteries moved by the Pulſe. But others alleadge attraction to be made by heat, without the fibres.</p>
               <p>Within the Veins are found certain<note place="margin">Who firſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Valves in the Veins.</note>

                     </gap> Bauhinus; Laurentius</hi> doth hardly once ſpeak of them.</p>
               <p>The occaſion of <hi>Aquapendents</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them was this: he obſerved that<note place="margin">How the Valves of the Veins were found.</note> if he preſt the Veins, or by rubbing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to force the Blood down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, its courſe did ſeem to be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Alſo in the Arms of perſons bound to be let Blood, certain knots apper to ſwell by reaſon of the Valves; and in ſome perſons, as Porters and Plough-men, they are ſeen to ſwel in their Thighs like the Varices.</p>
               <p>And here ſeems to conſiſt the Cauſe of the Varices; becauſe thick Blood and by<note place="margin">The Cauſe of the Varices.</note> its heavineſs unapt to move upwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long retained in the Valves, makes a dilatation of the ſaid Valves: for without the Valves the Veins would ſwel uniformly and all of an equal Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not in the manner of Varices.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this Doctrine of the Valves in the Veins, is known to few, I ſhall propound the ſame more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to my manner of handling rare ſubjects.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Valves</hi> are moſt, thin little Membranes (thicker in the Orifices of<note place="margin">The Valves of the Veins what?</note> of the Veins of the Heart) in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Cavity of the Veins; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain particles as it were of the coat of the Veins; becauſe there the body of the Veins is moſt thin, where th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe Membranes do go from it.</p>
               <p>They are <hi>ſeated</hi> in the Cavity of the<note place="margin">Where they are not found at the original of the Veins?</note> Veins, but eſpecially in the Veins of the Limbs, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Arms and Legs, after the Kernels of the Arm-pits and and Groyns.

               <p>No Valves are found in the Trunk of <hi>Cava,</hi> becauſe the Valves placed in<note place="margin">Why Valves are not found in the Trunk of Cava, the jugulars, the external ſmall Veins, nor in the Arteries?</note> the Divarications do ſufficiently hinder the regreſs of the Blood, nor doth the Trunk make any delay. nor are there any in the Jugulars (beſides thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid in the Orifice of the inner Veins) becauſe the venal Blood of it ſelf heavy, doth hardly aſcend upwards, nor doth it there need any ſtop.

Yet I have ſometimes obſerved the footſteps of a Valve in the Artery of the Arm, and it may be to ſtay the Blood run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Arteries in that ſubject, that it may not return, as we ſee in the beginning of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> and the <hi>Vena Arterioſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Valves are ſo ſituate, that they have their Orifices upwards towards the roots of the Veins, and are ſhut beneath, and alwaies look towards the Heart. And the workmanſhip of Nature is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their ſituation, in that they have their poſtures looking the ſame way one following another, as knots in the Branches and Stalks of Plants. that is to ſay, they are not in a right line one againſt another, or placed on the ſame ſide, leaſt the whole Blood ſhould flow ſtreight in through the free part of the veſſel. So the lower Valves do ſtop, what the upper have let ſlip: and if all the doors of the Valves had been diſpoſed in one right line, there had been little or no delay made in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
               <p>Moreover they are ſituate at Diſtances, according to the length of the veſſel, ſometimes two, three, four, or five fingers diſtance; that if the Blood by ſome default ſhould be compelled to flow backwards, and ſhould paſs the upper Valves, falling on upon the other Valves fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, it might be ſtopped and hindered.</p>

The Blood of its own accord is ſlowly enough driven, out of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Veins into the leſſer Branches, and out of hotter into colder places. And therefore according to his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the principles of Circulation, the uſe of the Valves is,</p>
               <p>III. Leſt the Blood ſhould move out of the great veins into the little ones and ſo tear them; or from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the Body into the outmoſt parts, but rather from the extremities to the Centre. And therefore they do the ſame thing in the Veins, which the Sigma and Miter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhap'd Valves do in the Heart.</p>
               <p>But in the Orifice of the Jugular Vein internal they perform the ſame Office, leaſt in the bowing back of the Head, the Blood ſhould return into the Brain, and like a Flood oppreſs the ſame, diſturb the Animal Functions, and breed a ſanguine Apoplexy.</p>

And that ſame blood would be more fit to nouriſh, by reaſon of the abundance of Arteries in the Spleen. The Veſſels being changed, this Opinion would be abſolutely true.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Aſellius,</hi> who rightly aſſigns the milkie veins to carry Chyle to the Liver, hath ſhewn that theſe common meſaraick Veins do ſerve to no other intent, then to bring blood out of the Liver to nouriſh the Guts. which uſe, being before refuted, he is therein to be excuſed, who was likewiſe ignorant of the true motion of the blood.</p>
               <p>6. Their true <hi>Uſe</hi> is to bring the Blood back after the the nutriment of the Guts, into the Liver, which had bin carried to the Guts, by the meſaraick Arteries. This is apparent by Ligatures in living Creatures, which <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus</hi> practiſed, in which they ſwell towards the Liver, but are empty towards the Guts. The <hi>Valves</hi> ſhew as much, which were by <hi>Harvey</hi> found out in the meſaraick veins, looking towards the Cava and the venae portae, which <hi>Columbus</hi> alſo obſerved, and which hinder the blood of vena portae from paſſing into the Guts. Nor does the Conflux of humors out of the Body about the Guts hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whither the Humors flow thither of their own accord or provoked by medicaments; becauſe this paſſage of the Humors is certainly through the meſenterick Arteries which neither <hi>Spigelius</hi> denies, nor thoſe that maintaine the Circulation of the Blood.</p>

In whoſe footſteps ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Anatomiſts treading, who priſed nothing more then truth, have found by teſtimony of their eyes, that thoſe ſame veſſels full of a milkie juyce, are peculiar paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages different from the Meſaraicks. For in living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they are allwayes to be ſeen, if they be diſſected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four hours after they have been well fed, viz. when the Chylus is diſtributed: for after that time they are not to be ſeen, howbeit, though empty, they alwaies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like little fibres which have deceived ſome, making them to take theſe veſſels for nervs: but they are out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nervs neither have ſuch a Chyle as this, nor Valves nor any cavity.

Conjugation. Some have conceived theſe veſſels to be Arteries, but contrary to ſenſe, which acknowledges here a ſimple coat, and no motion. Only the not knowing of their Trunk, does keep ſome learned men as yet in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, which if it could be demonſtrated to be in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they would be of out mind. But although their Trunk and Original be unknown yet no man ſhould doubt of the exiſtency of theſe Veins any more then the Inhabitants about <hi>Nilus</hi> doubt of the Exiſtency of that River, whoſe Head is unknown. And others account it no impoſſible thing, that they may by their twigs be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into the Liver without any Trunk. Yea and it ſeems not improbable to the renowned <hi>Kyperus</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> that the milkie veins being confounded with the Meſaraicks in the <hi>Pancreas</hi> or great kernel, do there emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty their Chyle into the <hi>Vena Portae,</hi> and ſo it is carried by the Veins into the Liver, that it may be mixed with the <hi>Fermentum</hi> brought from the Spleen, and ſo receive the Rudiments of Blood. But I ſhal by and by ſhew that the milkie veins have branches which reach into the Liver, where they are inſerted.</p>
               <p>But I will briefly relate the Hiſtory of theſe milkie veins, following the guidance<note place="margin">The Hiſtory of the Vena Lacteae.</note> of <hi>Aſellius</hi> and others, and mine own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, who have diligently viewed them, in live Animals, and Men newly hanged and choaked.</p>
               <p>Theſe veſſels are termed <hi>Lactes</hi> or <hi>Lactea</hi>

               <p>They are carried through the <hi>Meſenterium,</hi> from the Guts, by an oblique paſſage, between its two coats, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparate from the other veſſels, partly together with them, ſomtimes ſtreight along, otherwhiles going over the ſame, and cutting them croſswiſe as it were, through many Kernels, placed chiefly at the parting of the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; they are carried, I ſay as far as to the <hi>Pancreas.</hi> In the <hi>Pancreas</hi> or great kernel of the Meſentery, which <hi>Aſellius</hi> after <hi>Fallopius</hi> calls <hi>Pancreas,</hi> they are wreathed and wrought together like a Lattice, this way and that way, into very many and thoſe inexplicable wreathings and Labyrinths.</p>

               <p>II To render the Chyle more fit to receive the form of Blood in the Liver. But they are deceived who do aſſigne to them the blood-makeing faculty, for the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> is not at all changed in colour till it come unto the Liver, where it begins by little and little to grow reddiſh or paleiſh.</p>

Not the former, becauſe of the reaſons brought before, Book the 7 againſt <hi>Folius,</hi> touching the matter of Fat which <hi>Riolanus</hi> approves and commends; nor the latter, becauſe the Chyle would be infected by meeting with bitter Choler, though that renowned man allows in caſe of neceſſity, the Jejunum being obſtructed, it may ſo be done.</p>
               <p>And ſo much may ſuffice touching the Hiſtory ſo the Venae Lacteae, to which there is hardly any thing remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be added, unleſs the cauſe of their ſudden diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, which is ſufficiently controverted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is not to be imputed to the ſpiritual diſpoſition of the Chylus which ſuddenly vaniſhes away, as <hi>Aſellius</hi> did at firſt beleive, becauſe the Chylus being drawn out of the Veins does keep its colour a very long time, not vaniſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but becoming wateriſh.

For whereas in a Girle ten months old, <hi>Veſlingus</hi> found theſe Veins ſwelling: I aſcribe that to a like weakneſs of the Liver, or the thickneſs of the milkie humor. I alſo ſaw at <hi>Hafnia</hi> the laſt yeer, the milkey veins in <hi>Sueno Olai</hi> of <hi>Vardberg</hi> (who was immediately choak'd with a peice of neats-tongue, having before eaten and drank plentifully) viſible in the Meſentery, becauſe reſpiration being hindred by the bit of tongue, and his heart being ſuffocated, there was no neceſſity for the Liver to draw any Chylus. But <hi>P. Laurembergius</hi> as a man ignorant of this Anatomy does vainly imagine with himſelfe, that theſe veins do diſappear, becauſe of the recourſe of the Chylus to the Guts, the Valves being looſe and flaggie: for, 1 Do all you can, you ſhall never bring the Chylus back, in dead bodies into the Guts. 2 If a vein be tied in the middle, ſo that a paſſage is left open on both ſides, both towards the Liver and the Guts: where it looks to the Liver it is emptie, but it ſwells exceedingly towards the Guts, and if it be left in that poſture for ſome daies together the Chyle will not ſlip back into the Guts.</p>

the Kidnies and Bladder <hi>M. A. Severinus</hi> ingeniouſly proves, becauſe 1. The quittor muſt needs reſt at the bottom of the Midriff. 2. By the motion of the Septum it is eaſily made thin. 3. By the ſame motion the mouths of the veſſels are opened. which may more truly be ſaid of the Arteries, which carry Blood to the Kidnies by their emulgent Branches, and with the Blood ſundry excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as quittor, Serum &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the <hi>Vena cavae</hi> aſcends by the Septum, and boring its paſſage through the Pericardium, it goes a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle towards the left hand, and infinuates it ſelf into the right Ventricle of the Heart, with a large hole, where it is joyned on all ſides to the left Ear-let: and there is made,</p>
               <p>2 The <hi>Vena Coronaria,</hi> which is ſomtimes double, compaſſing the Baſis of the Heart, at the Riſe whereof a little <hi>Valve</hi> is placed, not ſuffering the Blood to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the Trunk. For it is joyned with a continued paſſage to the Artery, that it may therefrom receive blood, which is to return to the <hi>Cavae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards the aſcendent Trunk does at laſt, bore its way through the Pericardium, and taking the former ſhape, it had under the Heart, but ſmaller, thorugh the middle diviſion of the Lungs (no more upon the Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra's of the Cheſt, where now the Gullet and Weſand reſt) it aſcends to the Jugulum. Mean while there is bred</p>
               <p>3. A remarkable <hi>Vein</hi> above the Heart called <hi>Ayzgos, ſine pari,</hi> the Vein without a fellow, becauſe in a Man and a Dog, it is commonly but one, quartering on the one ſide, without another on the other ſide. But there are two in ſome Creatures which chew the cud, as Goats, and in Swine &amp;c. And in the Body of Man I have often ſeen two, once I found none at all, inſtead whereof on each ſide there deſcended a Branch from the <hi>Vena Subclavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It <hi>ariſes</hi> from the hinder part of the Cava but more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the right hand, and deſcends through the right Cavity of the Cheſt: but in Sheep contrariwiſe, it ariſes from the left ſide of the <hi>Cavae,</hi> and deſcends through the left. In a Man after its Beginning, which is between the fourth and fiſt Vertebra of the Cheſt, it bends a little back towards the right ſide and outwardly, unto the eighth or ninth Vertebra of the Cheſt; where it begins to poſſeſs the very middle ſpace. Howbeit, I have obſerved it preſently after its riſe, to deſcend right forward, above the middle of the Back-bone, and to ſend out branches on each ſide.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Truncus ſine pari,</hi> for the ſpace of eight lower Ribs, ſends out on each hand Intercoſtal branches, which are ſomtimes here and there joyned by way of Anaſtomoſis, with the branches of the<note place="margin">Anaſtomoſis.</note> Thoracica inferior which ariſes from the Baſilica, and with the Intercoſtal Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And therefore a Vein is not alwaies<note place="margin">The Error of <hi>Veſalius.</hi>
                  </note> to be opened in a Pleuriſie of the right ſide, as <hi>Veſalius</hi> would have it.</p>
               <p>Neer the Eighth Rib, it is divided into two Branches.</p>
               <p>The one being ſomtimes the greater, aſcends under the Diaphragma to the left ſide, and is inſerted ſomtimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Cavae</hi> above or beneath the Emulgents, ſomtimes into the Emulgent it ſelf. This way, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vulgar Doctrine, pleuritick<note place="margin">How pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick perſons are purged by Urine.</note> perſous, are many times critically purged by Urine, and void out that way abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Quittor: which matter may more truly be ſaid to be purged out by the emulgent Arteries, by mediation of the Heart.</p>
               <p>The other <hi>on the right hand,</hi> goes to the <hi>Cavae</hi> and is joyned thereto, ſeldom to the Emulgent, ſomtimes bove, the Emulgent. Often times it is implanted into the laſt ſomtimes into the firſt lumbal Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; for which cauſe, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">Why the Ham-vein is profitably opened in a Pleuriſie.</note> of a Pleuriſie, the Ham-vein may be opened, to draw away the Blood, which would otherwiſe aſcend out of the Arteries and ſmall Veins, into this Vein.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>axillary Vein</hi> as we have obſerved in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, is divided at the beginning of the Arm, into two remarkeable Branches: the upper and leſſer, or the Vena <hi>Cephalica,</hi> and the lower and greater or <hi>Eaſilica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The upper is called Vena <hi>humeraria Cubiti inferior, Cephalica</hi> or Capitalis, the Head-vein, becauſe it is wont to be opened in Diſeaſes of the Head, by the Ancients, and by later Surgeons alſo either out of Ignorance or Superſtition.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Brutes</hi> it <hi>ariſes</hi> from the external Jugular, in Men allwaies from the axillary, yet ſo that from the external Jugular a ſhort twig may be inſerted into the Cephalica.</p>
               <p>It is carried in the Surface of the Body, between the fleſhy Membrane and Coat of the Muſcles.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>external branch</hi> termed <hi>Funis Brachii,</hi> at the middle of the wriſt, in the lower part, is joyned to a branch of the Baſilica, and afterwards ariſing into the outer ſide of the wriſt, paſſing along between the ring finger and the little finger, it is called <hi>Salvatella,</hi> which is that which the <hi>Arabians</hi> term <hi>Siele,</hi> who as others at this day, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the opening thereof in the left hand, againſt melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick diſeaſes, acute Fevers, and tertian Agues, but in vain, and upon no ground at all.

               <p>They make that the <hi>inner branch</hi> of the <hi>Cephalica</hi> which conſtitutes the <hi>mediana.</hi>

               <p>This Vein is divided into more Boughes then the Head vein. Under the tendon of the pectoral muſcle it is divided into three Branches.</p>
               <p>I The firſt goes along with that Nerve of the Arme, which they cal the fourth.</p>
               <p>II The next is termed <hi>Medius</hi> and <hi>Profundus,</hi> beneath the Elboe Joynt divided into an external and an internal branch, ſeparated but a little way one from another. The former provides for the Thumb, Forefinger, and Middlefinger; as alſo for the external muſcles of the Hand. The latter being ſtretched along the middle bone of the Cubit, ſervs the Middlefinger, the Rinfinger, and the little finger, as alſo the internal Muſcles of the Hand.</p>
               <p>III The Subcutaneus is divided at the inner ſwelling of the Arm, is divided into a foremore and hindermore Branch: The latter deſcends under the Ulna by the little finger, where it is joyned to a Branch of the Cephalica. The former as it paſſes along the Cubit, produces another remarkeable Vein, which proceeds ſometimes directly, otherwhiles with various turnings unto the wriſt. And then as it is carried along the Cubit, with the inner Branch of the Cephalica, it makes a common Vein which is called</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mediana</hi> by <hi>Avicen nigra,</hi> tis cald the mediana or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Vein becauſe of its Sitnation in the midſt of the Arm. It is frequently opened without danger, becauſe there is no Nerve beneath it, but only the Tendon of a Muſcle. From this or rather from that part of the Baſilica, whence this ariſes, a branch is ſent forth, which being divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Radius,</hi> produces an exteriour branch, between the Thumb and the Forefinger, which ſome cal <hi>Cephalica,</hi> others <hi>Occularis,</hi> and ſome again as <hi>Mundinus, Salvatella,</hi> and another more inward, betwixt the middle finger, and the Ring finger, which ſome as <hi>Rhaſis</hi> count the <hi>Sielc</hi> or rather <hi>Seilem</hi> of <hi>Avicenna.</hi>

               <p>ARteria an Artery ſo called from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining<note place="margin">The name Artery.</note> and preſerving Air or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; was by the Antients <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the name of the Wind-pipe, which alſo <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> calls <hi>Arteria magna. Galen</hi> makes a diſtinction and cals the Wind-pipe <hi>Aſpera Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria</hi> the rough Artery, and thoſe whereof we are now to treat <hi>Arteriae leves</hi> the ſmooth Arteries, which <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> cals <hi>Arterias parvas, Ariſtotle</hi> ſomtimes <hi>Venam Aor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi> otherwhiles ſimply <hi>Aorta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now an <hi>Artery</hi> properly ſo called, is a common Organ, round, long, hollow like a<note place="margin">What an Artery is.</note> pipe; conſiſting of a double Coat, proceeding from the Heart, fit to carry Blood and vital ſpirits to all parts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Efficient</hi> is the proper Artery-making faculty, which may be called <hi>Artoropoietice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>matter</hi> whereof it is made, is a clammy and cold part of the ſeed, according to <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> And this is the Beginning of its Generation.</p>
               <p>The Beginning of its Diſpenſation, is not the Brain, as <hi>Pelops Galen's</hi> Maſter would have it, but the Heart by the Conſent of all Philoſophers and Phyſitians. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Arteries proceed out of the left Chamber or Ventricle of the Heart, not the middlemoſt, which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſeigns to himſelf, and would have the Aorta to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed therefrom. And therefore the <hi>Arteria magna</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Heart, as alſo the <hi>Venoſa Arteria,</hi> and the <hi>Vena Arterioſa,</hi> but theſe out of the right Ventricle; of which we have ſpoken already in the <hi>ſecond Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>End</hi> or Uſe is, 1. Inaſmuch as<note place="margin">The End of the Arteries.</note> they are Conduit-pipes, they carry the Blood and vital or arterial ſpirit made in the Heart (for Spirit alone without Blood is not contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Arteries) to all parts of the Body. 1. To communicate life or vital faculty, that the vital ſpirit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the parts, and their Native heat may be ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and cheriſhed. 2. That animal ſpirit may be bred, in the noble Ventricle of the Marrow. 3. For the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of all the parts, which are nouriſhed by theſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and their Blood and not by the venal Blood or Veins. 4. To carry the Excrements of the Body and the Blood therewith mingled, either to the outer parts of the body to the Kidnies, or the Meſentery, or the Womb, or the haemorrhoid Veins, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>II. Inaſmuch as they are moved and<note place="margin">Why the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries pulſe.</note> pulſe perpetually; they afford this benefit. 1. That the heat of the parts is fanned, cooled and tempered, and ſo a ſymmetrie or due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Heat is preſerved. which is cauſed, not ſo much by the Airs being drawn in, when the Artery is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, to avoid Vacuum, as by the arterial Blood conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually flowing in, impregnated with Air. 2. That this nouriſhing arterial Blood, may be continually poured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſmalleſt Arteries, and from thence into the parts of the Body. For <hi>in the firſt place,</hi> the Heart by continuall pulſing, drives the Blood into the greater Arteries, which becauſe they cannot let it return becauſe of the Valves, and are too ſtrong to break, it muſt needs be driven to to the very ſmalleſt Arteries and the parts of the Body. And thoſe parts not being nouriſhed with all that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in, do ſend back that which is ſuperfluous into the Veins, that ſo it may be circulated. <hi>Moreover,</hi> an Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie being bound in any part of the Body, it is filled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Heart, otherwiſe than the Veins; contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe towards the ſmalleſt Arteries and the parts it is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In Blood-letting, the Arm being indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:41352:104"/>
hard bound and the pulſe remaining, the Arm is filled, and a Vein being opened below the band, Blood plentifully iſſues, which becauſe it cannot come out of the Veins which lying higher are ſtopped by the Ligature, it muſt needs be brought from the Arteries beneath. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in live-Creatures diſſected, this Tumor of the Arteries is obſerved neer their Original, and a lankneſs towards the extream parts of Body, into which they go; and when they are opened, there is a mighty flux of blood, on this ſide the band, none beyond it. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> the ſame is to be ſeen by an Aneuriſma. 3. Leaſt the Blood of the Veins to which they are joyned, ſhould be ſtil, and putrifie like ſtanding waters, and that the Heart may not be deſtitute of Blood in its continual expulſion, by the driving Arteries it is continually filled again through the Veins.</p>
               <p>This Motion of the Arteries called the <hi>Pulſe,</hi> is cauſed, either by the faculty alone,<note place="margin">The Pulſe how cauſed.</note> whether ſeated in the Arteries themſelves, as <hi>Praxagoras</hi> would have it, or flowing from the Heart by the coats of the Arteries, as <hi>Galen</hi> and infinite Phyſitians after him have taught, eſpecially by reaſon of a little Reed put into the Arteries, under which they are not mov'd, by reaſon of the Intercepton of their coat, til it be taken away. again, becauſe as the Heart is contracted and widened, ſo are the Arteries, as appears by laying one hand to the region of the Heart, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Wriſt, and by wounds in the Heart and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: or by the <hi>Blood</hi> either boyling according to <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> or rarefied according to <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> or meerly diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as <hi>Harvey</hi> hath proved: or from both the Blood fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the faculty directing, which is my opinion. For that the Arteries are moved and diſtended by the <hi>Blood,</hi> I prove. 1. The Heart by its perpetual pulſing, expels great ſtore of Blood, as I have demoſtrated in my Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Heart. 2. That the ſame Blood doth fill and move the Arteries, the Artery it ſelf ſhews, being laid bare, into which at every pulſe, you ſhall feel with your fingers the Blood driven in to flow down, with which it is dilated. 3. When an Artery is opened, Blood leaps out, at every pulſe, as out of the Heart. 4. <hi>Harvey</hi> ſaw a portion of the deſcendent Artery with two crural branches a ſpan long taken out of the Body of a Gentleman, which was turned into a fiſtulous hollow bone, and nevertheleſs the Blood which when he was living, deſcended through the the Cavity thereof into his Legs, did move the Arteries beneath, by its impulſe. The ſame hath been obſerved by others in the <hi>Arteria Aorta</hi> 5. In an Aneuriſma the fleſh is manifeſtly ſeen to pulſe, as formerly the Artery being ſound was wont to do by the afflux of Blood. 6. The waving, Worm-creeping pulſe, do argue the ſame, in the judgment of <hi>Walaeus.</hi> 7. <hi>Harvey</hi> gives us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rare experiment, made with the Guts of a Dog, Wolf or other Creature dried, blown up and filled with Water. For if we ſmite one end with our Finger, and lay our fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the other end, we may cleerly perceive every ſtroak, and the difference of the motion. Howbeit I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the faculty ought to be joyned hereto, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Coats from the Heart, by help whereof, they are contracted and widned; becauſe, 1. Otherwiſe the Flux of the Blood would be inordinate, and the pulſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies unequal. 2. All the Arteries are dilated or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in one moment, but the Blood alone fils the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſucceſſively and moves them part after part. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Gloves being blown into, all the fingers are puffed up at once, which <hi>Harvey</hi> objects, and in a Baſin the blow and motion are at once in both ends: but corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al blood is of another Nature, which cannot be moved like ſpecies or Winds. 3. The Faculties or Irradiation of vital light, may run through all parts in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an Eve, like the Light of the Sun. See more of this in the Chapter of the Heart. 4. Hence within <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> his Reed the Artery is obſcurely moved, becauſe the ſwift motion of the Blood ceaſes when the Faculty is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Howbeit, <hi>Harvey</hi> and <hi>Walaeus</hi> argue differently about this difficult Experiment.</p>
               <p>Now all the Arteries are widened<note place="margin">Whether the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries are dilated together with the Heart or no.</note> when the Heart is contracted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted when the Heart is widened, which is certain from the diſſection of an Artery and the Heart, and from Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures, nor was it ſo long ago unknown to <hi>Eraſiſtratus,</hi> and reaſon confirmes the ſame, becauſe when the Heart expels, then are the the Arteries filled with its Blood. Yet have they not contrary pulſes, as we find by laying our hand to the wriſt and the Region of the Heart, at one and the ſame time, for the pulſe of the Heart is perceived by us in its Syſtole, but that of the Arteries in the Diaſtole, when they are filled, becauſe the two motions, are at one and the ſame time. The ſmalleſt <hi>capillary</hi> Arteries are not perceived to pulſe, becauſe there is not ſo much force in them, and therefore we can hardly diſcern them from the Veins. alſo they have thin Coats, ſo that the Blood is ſeen through them, as through the Veins.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Form</hi> is apparent from the Accidents; howbeit the form of an Arterie is the Subſtancial Soul, as it is of the whole Body beſides.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Situation</hi> is deep, allwaies under the Veins, that they might be more ſafe, and that not only in the external, but the internal parts alſo, if you except the Belly, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Kidneies: For after that the Vena Cava and the Aorta, deſcending from the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> have paſſed the Region of the Kidneies, the Cava hides it ſelf under the Aorta through all that region, til they paſs out of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen; for then the Arterie does again ſide it ſelfe under the Cava. The Cauſe whereof <hi>Plempius</hi> conceives to be this; that otherwiſe there would have bin danger, leaſt the bending of the Body often happening in that place, the Vena cava having but a ſingle Coat, would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the ſaid motion.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Magnitude</hi> is ſufficiently great, but<note place="margin">Its Magnitude.</note> the deſcending part of the Arterle is greater, the aſcendent leſſer, becauſe the Number of the internal parts is greater then of the external.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Number</hi> of the Arteries is fewer then of the Veins, becauſe the paſſage of the Blood is quick through the Arteries, ſlow through the Veins, and therefore there are many receptacles provided for that Blood which is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by certain pulſes. Yet there are more Arteries then we think, or can be diſcerned by us, becauſe the capillary Arteries are exceeding like to Veins.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Shape</hi> is like a Pipe or Channel, ſmooth, round, and long.</p>
               <p>As to their <hi>Paſſages.</hi> Some Arteries are terminated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Guts, by which expulſion of Excrements is cauſed; ſome have their mouths terminated into the Skin, through which the external air is attracted (in Tranſpiration which is performed alſo by the Veins) and ſooty ſteams expelled. <hi>Platerus</hi> denies that they are inſerted into the Bones, but <hi>Spigelius</hi> obſerved at <hi>Padua,</hi> in a great corruption of the <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They are compaſſed (like the<note place="margin">Whether the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do feel.</note> Veins) ſometimes with a membrane thick and common, from the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts, when they are without the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But other Arteries are without Senſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Arteries is mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous,<note place="margin">Their Subſtance.</note> ſo that they may be diſtended and compreſſed more then the Veins. <hi>Fallopius</hi> thought

But that many things are changed into a boney ſubſtance, which were not griſley<note place="margin">How many Coats an Arterie hath.</note> 
                  <hi>Columbus</hi> teaches in the <hi>ſeptum Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> Now an Arterie conſiſts of two peculiar <hi>Coats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Exterior</hi> is thin, ſoft, rare, as the Coat of a Vein is.</p>
               <p>The <hi>interior</hi> is compact, hard, and very thick, viz. five times thicker then the Coat of the Veins: And therefore <hi>Herophilus</hi> ſaid, that the Arteries were ſix times thicker then the Veins, for this Cauſe, that they might be ſtrong in their perpetual motion, and that their thin Blood ſhould not ſoon vaniſh and fly away, being ſpirituous and vaporous. And therefore in the opening of an Arterie, the inciſion muſt be made deep, with a broad and ſharp Lancet, becauſe of the deep Situation of the Arterie, and thickneſs of the Skin. The opening of an Arterie is allowed of by theſe<note place="margin">Whether an Artery may be opened, and how.</note> ancients <hi>Oribaſius, Aegineta, Aetius, Actuarius, Aurelianus, Abenſina.</hi> With good ſucceſs <hi>Galen</hi> practiſed it, in a diſeaſe of the Eyes proceeding from hot Blood, ful of vapors, and in pains of the Hips. <hi>Panarolus</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the ſame kind of remedie in a Phrenzie, and <hi>Alpinus</hi> writes that it is frequent in <hi>Aegipt,</hi> which <hi>Paraeus</hi> did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe exerciſe in <hi>France, M.

But ſeeing it did certainly profit the Patients, I conceive it was practiſed rather by way of preſervation, then of Cure. For the antecedent cauſe being ſomewhat evacuated by the outer Arteries, the conjunct cauſe is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily extruded by the jugular Veins. More over, ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Vein or Arterie may be obſtructed, ſo that neither the latter can ſend, nor the former receive, unleſs they be opened.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Arteriae ſubclaviae</hi> before they go out of the Cheſt (for then they are termed <hi>Axillares</hi> when they are out) from their lower part, do produce the <hi>Intercoſtales ſuperiores</hi> to the Intervals of three or four of the upper Ribs; from their upper part. 1.

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the deſcending Trunk of the great Arterie.</head>
               <p>THe Trunk of the <hi>Aorta</hi> or great Arterie <hi>deſcending</hi> is greater, becauſe it ſends out branches from it ſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the middle and lower belly, as alſo into the Thighes.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Cheſt</hi> or middle Bellie, two Arteries proceed from the greater Trunk.</p>
               <p>I The <hi>Intercoſtales inferiores</hi> which go unto the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls of eight Ribs, and the neighbouring Muſcles. For it ſeldom happens, that the Vein ſine pari, has to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it an Arterie ſine pari, ariſeing from the Trunk. By theſe intercoſtals if we beleive <hi>Spigelius,</hi> quittor and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter collected in the Cheſt, are received into the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, and thence by the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> emulgent Veins carried into the Bladder, which has alſo reaſon to back it, becauſe the congeſted matter is more eaſily hurried through the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the way is ſhorter. I add that quittor more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily follows the natural motion of the Arterial Blood then of the venal.</p>
               <p>II. The <hi>Phrenica</hi> to ſerve the Midriff and Pericardium, or Heart-bag.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the Trunk peirces through the Clift of the Septum, and ſpreads branches through the lower Belly, ſome of which accompany the branches of vena portae, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Branches of Vena Cava. Thoſe which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Branches of vena portae are three;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coeliaca Arteria, Meſenterica Superior &amp; Inferior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Caeliaca,</hi> ſo called becauſe it ſends many branches unto the Stomach, proceeds foreward from the Aorta, being under propped by the Call, and is divided into the <hi>Ramus dexter</hi> which is the ſmaller, and the <hi>Siniſter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> which is the larger, which under the hinder region of the Stomach, are knit to the Vena Portae in the Pancreas.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dexter</hi> aſcending to the Cavity of the Liver, and proceeding a little forwards, on the higher ſide produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Gaſtrica dextra,</hi> and the <hi>Cyſticae gemellae;</hi> from its low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part, <hi>Epiploe dextra, Inteſtinalis,</hi> and <hi>Gaſtroepiploïs dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> in imitation of the <hi>Vena portae.</hi> therefore let what was ſaid there, be here repeated. The Remainder from the <hi>Ramus dexter</hi> goes into the hollow ſurface of the Liver.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Siniſter</hi> or <hi>Arteria Splenica,</hi> is greater than the <hi>Dexter,</hi> leaſt it ſhould be eaſily obſtructed by thick juyces, and that it may pour ſufficient vital blood, into the Spleen. This Artery drawn out into the <hi>Vena Splenica,</hi> by a bending and crooked Courſe goes to the Spleen, and then ſpreads branches after the ſame manner as the <hi>Vena Splenica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Meſenterica ſuperior</hi> is diſtributed welnigh into the whole Meſentery, and conſtitutes the <hi>Arteriae Meſaraicae,</hi> in the Gut Jejunum, Ileon and part of Colon: whoſe uſe is, 1. To communicate native heat into the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts, and thoſe whereinto they are inſerted. 2. In a ſickly ſtate to receive the Excrement- of the whole body, as the Meſaraick Veins do, to empty them into the Guts, which uſe was firſt found out by <hi>Spigelius.</hi> 3. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Meſaraick Arteries draw Chyle. 1. Becauſe of their Carriage. 2. Becauſe of their Ends. 3. Of their Contents. 4. The Authority of <hi>Galen</hi> in his 4. <hi>de uſu partium</hi> and in his Treatiſe <hi>An in Arteria ſit ſanguis ch.</hi> 5. whom <hi>Hofman</hi> follows. But they cannot draw Chyle, becauſe Chyle was never ſeen in them, and the Arteries receive nothing from the parts, but communicate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to thoſe parts whereinto they are inſerted. Nor do they draw to the Heart, as <hi>Varolus</hi> would have it, for the valves hinder: and the Chyle is not natural to the Heart. Nor to the Liver or Spleen, as others ſuppoſe, becauſe only the Splenick Arteries do carry vital Blood to the Spleen, and there is only one little Artery implanted in the Liver. Nor is it returned out of the Arteries into the Veins, as <hi>Spigelius</hi> imagins, for ſo there would be labour in vain; Nor do they carry this Chyle to the Caeliaca: becauſe nothing aſcends by the Arteries, but all deſcends by them to the parts. Therefore 4. The true uſe of the <hi>Meſaraick</hi> Arteries according to the Principles of <hi>Walaeus</hi> is, to carry Arterial blood to the Guts, for their nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which motion of the Humors, Ligatures do ſhew in live-Anatomies. For the Meſaraick Arteries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound, do ſwell towards the Trunk and the Heart, and are empty towards the Guts, which ſuck in the blood, and ſend back what is ſuperfluous, through the meſaraick Veins to the Liver.</p>
               <p>For the Blood is alſo circularly<note place="margin">Whether the Blood of the Belly be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated.</note> moved in the Abdomen, out of the coeliac and meſenterick Arteries, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Vena portae,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>Riolanus</hi> his denying the ſame, by his motion through the Trunks, becauſe</p>

                  <item>2.

                  </item>
                  <item>3. Ligatures demonſtrate the ſame here, as in other places.</item>

               <list>
                  <item>1. That the Blood of the <hi>Vena portae</hi> is not ſo impure, if it be compared with that of the <hi>Cava,</hi> but that it is ſomtimes purer than it; and though it be more dreggy, there is the more need for it to run back, to be made more pure by the Liver and Heart.</item>
                  <item>2. That there are in the Liver Anaſtomoſes either of the <hi>Vena portae</hi> and <hi>Vena cava</hi> (though they are not ſo apparent in a dead body) or ſuch as open into the paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma of the Liver.</item>
                  <item>3. Somtimes there is a remarkable palpitation of the <hi>Arteria coeliaca</hi> in hypochondriacal diſorders, which alſo <hi>Mercatus</hi> and <hi>Fernelius</hi> have obſerved, without any muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pulſe, viz. the Hypochondrium being ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Wind, or with ſome diſtemper, whereby the ſame Blood coming from the Heart, may be changed in this Region: but that by the Palpitation of the lower parts, the Heart is many times changed, <hi>Tulpius</hi> hath an Example. See alſo other Arguments, learnedly reſuted by <hi>Slegelius.</hi>

In the Brain there is no Conjunction of Arteries and Nerves by Anaſtomoſes. 2. An Artery being hurt or cut in the Head, no Convulſion follows. 3. The diſtinct Riſe of the Nerves in the Brain is apparent, as of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries in the Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> did conceive they came from the <hi>Dura Mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this day many Phyſitians conceive with <hi>Galen,</hi> that ſome Nerves ariſe from the Brain, others from the Spinal Marrow: who are all confuted by <hi>Ocular inſpection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>End</hi> and Uſe is, to carry the Animal faculty with the Animal ſpirit, from the Brain, like conduit pipes, into the parts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Senſory, as the Eyes, Ears, &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>2. Motive, as the Muſcles.</item>
                  <item>3. All in a manner, that they may in general perceive and underſtand what cauſeth pain.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And therefore the Nerves inſerted into the parts, do give to the ſaid parts either Senſe alone, or Motion alone, or both Senſe and Motion: nor is there any voluntary motion or ſenſe without the help of a Nerve; and therefore a Nerve being cut, that part is preſently deprived of Senſe and Motion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nerves</hi> therefore, I ſay, do <hi>afford</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Whether the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nerves and the ſenſitive dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</note> to the parts either <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Motion,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are diſſeminated into ſuch and ſuch parts, becauſe the Nerves of themſelves are not <hi>ſenſitive</hi> or <hi>motive.</hi> So that if they be implanted into Muſcles the Organs of Motion, they are termed motive Nerves; if into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of ſenſe, ſenſitive. Many times alſo according to the Nature of the Parts, one pare of Nerves affords both ſenſe and motion. As the ſixt pare of the Nerves of the Brain, commonly ſo called, is communicated to the Bowels of the middle and lower Belly to cauſe the Senſe of Feeling; and when it becomes recurrent, it beſtows
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:41352:107"/>
motion upon the Muſcles of the Larynx. The optick pare ſo called, gives only ſenſe, becauſe implanted into the Eyes only. But the other pare which is termed <hi>motorium par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> the moving pare, and ariſes from the marrow as well as the former, cauſes motion becauſe it is implanted into the Muſcles of the Eyes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Situation</hi> of the Nerves, for ſecurities ſake, is more profound and deep than that of the Arteries.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Magnitude</hi> is various, according to the condition of the Organs and dignity of the Actions, their Aſſiduity and Magnitude. The optick Nerves are great, becauſe the action of the Eyes is ſo; alſo thoſe Nerves are moſt thick which are ſent to remote and many parts, as the Limbs; indifferent in the ſenſory parts; for becauſe they were to be ſoft, they could not be very ſmall: the Nerves of the neereſt parts are ſmalleſt of all, as in the Muſcles of the Face.</p>
               <p>The Nerves are commonly ſaid to be <hi>ſeven and thirty pare</hi> in <hi>number;</hi> ſeven pare<note place="margin">A new opinion of the Author touching the number of the Nerves.</note> from the Brain, which I ſay ariſe not from the Brain, but from the <hi>Medulla oblonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> within the Skull, and thirty from the Marrow in the Back-bone.

               <p>Moreover as to number, you muſt know that every Nerve hath its mate or Companion,<note place="margin">The Nervus ſine pari.</note> except the laſt or loweſt proceeding from the ſpinal Marrow.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Riolanus</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> excepts the Nerves of the Privity manifeſtly hollow, which nevertheleſs his Son excuſes to have been meant of the hollow Ligaments of the Privity, who is better verſt in Anatomy than his Father was, and ſo alſo <hi>Laurentius</hi> ſpoke. <hi>Severinus</hi> in his Zootome, ſaies, the Nerves of a <hi>Bulls pizzle</hi> are hollow. <hi>Galen</hi> alſo adds the Optick Nerves,<note place="margin">Whether the Optick Nerves are hollow.</note> which he will have to be hollow and perforated, ſenſibly and manifeſtly: for the diſcerning whereof he conceives three things are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, <hi>viz.</hi> That 1. The Animal be great. 2. That it be cut up as ſoon as killed. 3. That the Air be cleer and bright. <hi>Plempius</hi> doth alſo require three things more, that the Nerve be cut aſunder with a moſt ſharp Knife, that it be not ſqueezed nor ſtretched, and that it be cut beyond the growing together of the two Nerves. <hi>Cornclius Gemma</hi> ſubſcribes to <hi>Galen,</hi> who attributes rather a paſſage to be ſeen like a prick in the inner ſubſtance of the Nerves.</p>
               <p>Others conceive the poroſity is better ſeen in the optick Nerves being boiled. <hi>Fallopius</hi> ſaies that <hi>Galen</hi> thought thus, becauſe in the Bodies of Apes which he diſſected, all Nerves are pervions. Howbeit <hi>Spigelius</hi> admits only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain paſſages in the beginnings of Nerves, where they grow together, and ſoon after towards the Eyes it vaniſhes. I alſo ſaw a Cavity and Publickly did ſhew the ſame in a dead body, after they were joyned, and before they entred into the Eye.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Veſalius, Eustachius,</hi> and <hi>Coiterus,</hi> deny theſe Nerves to have any Cavity againſt <hi>Galen,</hi> and ſo do others, and produce experiments which ſucceed not, unleſs the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aforeſaid be obſerved.</p>
               <p>All the reſt of the Nerves do want a manifeſt Cavity, but they have <hi>Pores,</hi> through which the ſubtile ſpirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, leaſt we ſhould grant penetration of bodies which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Theſe pores are double according to <hi>Hogeland, leſſer</hi> and <hi>greater,</hi> through the former ſubtil aerial bodies paſs to move the parts; by the later, bodies leſs ſubtil. Neither of them is diſcernable to the Senſe. Nor are there two ſorts of Spirits in the Brain. I am rather apt to believe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Indigence of every part and the pleaſure of the will and the Imagination, ſometimes more ſpirit paſſes through the greater, ſometimes leſs through the leſſer, which the more plentiful or ſcanty influx of the Spirit doth make.</p>
               <p>Moreover all the Nerves do conſiſt, none excepted, of many nervous fibres or filaments which grow mutually toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by little Membranes. I my ſelf, with <hi>Johannes Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicenus,</hi> a right diligent Anatomiſt, have obſerved the Trunk of Nerves neer the Hips, if it be diſſected, to ſhew a Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as it were, conſiſting of an infinite contexture of fibres, like little Worms, whereas elſewhere it is one continued bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with cohaering and continued fibres.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Nerves is thought to be threefold: the internal, white, and marrowiſh (by which as the Centre the action is performed) from the marrow of the Brain, but more compact and thickned; and an external, being a twofold coat; the outer harder, proceeding from the <hi>Dura Mater;</hi> the inner finer, from the <hi>Pia Mater.</hi> Which Membranes do the ſame for the Nerves, which the <hi>Dura</hi> and <hi>Pia Mater</hi> do for the Brain. Howbeit this diſtinction of Subſtances, is to be ſearcht out, rather by Reaſon than by Senſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cartefius</hi> ſuppoſes that there are Valves in the Nerves, which ſtop the Spirit that it may not flow back, otherwiſe the parts cannot be moved. But it ſeems to me, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may not be retained in the parts, which the Soul that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the Spirit as far as to the Valve, ſhall direct it into the very parts. For no Anatomiſt as yet hath obſerved any Valves. Nor can ſubtile Spirits be ſtopped by Valves. Nor would Apoplexies or Palſies ſo eaſily happen, if the Spirits could be detained in the parts by Valves.</p>
               <p>Beſides Valves <hi>H. Regius</hi> introduces likewiſe a circulation of the animal Spirits in the Nerves. For after they are diſtributed from the Brain to the whole Body, he conceives part is diſſipated by inſenſible Tranſpiration, and part being inſinuated into the Veins, is mingled with the Blood, and returns with it into the Heart, and thence again into the Brain and Nerves. He proves this by the example of a Snail encloſed in a glaſs, in which the ſpirits through its tranſparent Body, are ſeen to move and paſs from the Tail through the Belly, to the Head; and from the Head through the Back, to return to the Tayl, and from thence to the Head again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But in moſt bodies the inner ſubſtance of the Nerves is confounded, as I have obſerved by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Inquiſition.</p>
               <p>The growing together of the optick nerves, was therfore contrived by Nature, either left the ſenſible object being received in by both Eyes ſhould ſeem double, or that the Viſive ſpirit might, if need were, be all conveighed into one Eye which are the conjectures of <hi>Galen,</hi> or finally for ſtrength and ſtability here neceſſary, leaſt in Concuſſions of the Brain they might hap to be broken or diſtorted, or leaſt through the ſoftneſs and moiſtneſs of the Brain and optick Nerves, by reaſon of diſtillations and other Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they might become flaggie, and ſo driven out of their right ſtation; which is the opinion of <hi>Plempius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after being ſeperated they go out of the Skull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Centre of the Eyes in Mankind, but much lower in Beaſts, becauſe they look more ſidewaies.</p>
               <p>Within the Skull they are cloathed only with the <hi>Pia mater;</hi> but from the holes, which paſs to the Eyes, they are covered with the <hi>dura mater.</hi> Afterward it ſpreads the latter to the <hi>Sclirotica tunica,</hi> the former to the <hi>Tunica cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roïdes,</hi> and its inner marrowy ſubſtance to the <hi>Retina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>third pare,</hi> which others count the ſecond, is the <hi>motorium oculorum,</hi> the <hi>Eye-mover,</hi> next unto the former.</p>
               <p>This pare is thought by vulgar A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomiſts to ariſe from the Brain,<note place="margin">The Error of others about the Riſe of the Eye-movers.</note> neer the original of the firſt pare.

It ſometimes though ſeldom ſends a branch to the temporal Muſcle; and that is the Cauſe that the ſaid Muſcle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt, the Eye is hurt, and the Eye being hurt that is hurt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth, Fift</hi> and <hi>Sixt</hi> pares are much confounded by Anatomiſts. For ſome make the fourth and fift Pare one, and call it the third Pare, conſiſting of two roots; the leſſer of which ſome do make the third pare, and they themſelves do make the fift and ſixt pare one, viz, the fourth pare by them ſo called. But thoſe who reckon it for one, they count the fourth pare, according to my rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, for the leſſer root of the third pares and the ſixt pare for the fourth. whereas we diſtinguiſh all theſe pares.</p>

            <head>THE Fourth and laſt Manual OF THE BONES And alſo of the Griſtles and Ligaments Anſwering the FOURTH BOOK Of the Limbs.</head>
            <p>IN the laſt place, I ſhall briefly (as I<note place="margin">The reaſon of the Authors Method. Why he treats laſt of the Bones.</note> have done other things) explain the Doctrine of the Bones.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, I ſay, becauſe when all things elſe are removed and ſeparated, then only the <hi>Bones</hi> come in view, and are ſubject to examination. The moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Riolanus</hi> treats in two places of his Enchiridion, of the Bones, once as they appear in the dead Carkas, when the Mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcles are cut off, and again as they are dried in a Skeleton. But this Oſtentation is ſuperfluous in a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium. For by the ſame reaſon we ſhould make a new A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomical diſcourſe, of the Veins, Arteries, Nerves, Guts, Stomach, Womb, and other Parts taken out, and dried, and commonly hung up for ſhew in the Anatmoical Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres. There is no uſe of the latter Doctrine of the Bones, unleſs to help the Memory, nor is it perfectly underſtood without the former. And therefore other Anatomiſts, with the parts demonſtrate the Bones lying beneath them, in the dead body. I ſhal therefore only buſie my ſelf with the firſt, and therewith.</p>
            <p>Joyn the Doctrine of <hi>Griſtles</hi> and <hi>Ligaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Becauſe of the ſimilitude of their ſubſtance: for theſe three ſimilar<note place="margin">Why he treats of the Griſtles and Ligaments with the Bones.</note> parts are very neer of kin, A <hi>Bone,</hi> a <hi>Griſtle,</hi> and a <hi>Ligament,</hi> ſo that they ſeem to differ only gradually in reſpect of more and leſs one from another. For a <hi>Bone</hi> is the hardeſt, a <hi>Griſtle,</hi> a little ſofter, yet ſo as that it may turn to a Bone, as we ſee in the tender Bones of Infants, which at firſt were griſty. A <hi>Ligament</hi> is yet ſofter than a Griſtle, which alſo it ſelf ſomtimes turns to a Bone, as in decrepit Perſons. Hence many attribute the ſame matter to a Bone, a Griſtle, a Ligament, yea and a Tendon.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe of the Nearneſs of Place; for a Bone, a Griſtle, and a Ligament do for the moſt part accompany one another, and are found joyned together. For the Bones are tied with the Ligaments, and where they are ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are covered about their Heads, with a Griſtly Cruſt or Cover.</p>

               <p>Of the <hi>ſolid Bones</hi> not hollowed, the immediate Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive matter, is thick Blood ſent in through the pores; becauſe 1.

               </list>
               <p>The <hi>Situation</hi> of the Bones is deep, becauſe they are the Foundations and Upholders of the Body.</p>
               <p>They vary in <hi>Magnitude</hi> according to the variety of their Utilities. <hi>Great</hi> are the Bones of the Leg, Thigh, Arm, Shoulder, &amp;c. <hi>Small</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Ear</hi> ſerving for <hi>Hearing,</hi> the <hi>Seſamoidean</hi> Bones, the <hi>Teeth,</hi> the <hi>Wriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>They are many in number and not one only, becauſe of the variety<note place="margin">Why many Bones in a living Creature.</note> of motions; and leſt that one being hurt, all ſhould be hurt.</p>
               <p>Now a monſtrous thing it is for a Child to be born without Bones, ſuch an one as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaks of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Boy, four fingers big, but not long-liv'd the like to which <hi>Foreſtus</hi> alſo ſaw.</p>
               <p>The Number of all the Bones of the Body, is not the ſame in all Perſons. For in Children they are more, which by degrees grow together and become fewer. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may number the Epiphyſis by themſelves as diſtinct Bones, and ſo make a mighty number. Others may omit the Seſamoidean and other ſmall Bones, or ſuch as are ſeldom found, as in the Carotick Arteries: and ſo doth <hi>Archangelus</hi> who reckons but two hundred forty nine: others make commonly three hundred and four. Others as many as there are daies in the year.</p>
               <p>They vary in <hi>Figure</hi> ſome are round, others flat, ſome ſharp, others blunt, &amp;c. as ſhal be ſhewed when we come to ſpeak ſeverally of the particulars.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Colour</hi> in ſuch as are naturally conſtituted, is white, mixt with a very little red.</p>
               <p>They are all of them externally <hi>incloſed</hi> (not internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) with the Perioſtium, excepting the Teeth, ſeſamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean Bones, and the ſides of the other Bones where they are mutually joyned one to another. And the Perioſtium is exquiſitely ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:<note place="margin">The Perioſtium feels, but not the Bones. The Senſe of the Teeth.</note> but the Bones themſelves want the ſenſe of Feeling, excepting the Teeth, to whom we may attribute ſome Senſe, ſeeing they feel exceeding cold Air or Water, yea with their Ends: eſpecially when the Teeth are on Edge, before it reach to the little Membranes and Nerves, by help wherof they are thought to Feel.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Connexion</hi> of the Bones is various. But the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and artificial hanging together of all the Bones is by the Greeks cal'd Skeleton, as if you would ſay a dried Carcaſs from <hi>Skellein</hi> to drie. Being compacted partly with the natural Ligaments dried with the Bones, &amp; partly with artificial ones, ſomtimes bolt upright, otherwhiles in the poſture of ſitting; which doth not properly belong to Anatomy, but the other Natural Oſteology, framed by Nature, and adorned with its own moiſt Ligaments.</p>
               <p>And this natural Cohaerence or Connexion, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> is made either <hi>Cat' árthron</hi> by way of Joynting; or <hi>catà ſumphuſin,</hi> by way of growing together.</p>
               <p>He makes <hi>Arthron</hi> a Joynt to be double; viz. <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throſis</hi> or by way of Diarticulation or joynting, ſuch as are <hi>Enárthroſis, Arthrodia</hi> and <hi>Gigglumos:</hi> or <hi>Sunarthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> ſuch as he reckons <hi>Suture, Harmonie</hi> and <hi>Gomphoſis</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover <hi>Symphyſis</hi> or growing together, is ſaid to be with or without a Medium.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall thus divide the Connexions of the Bones.</p>
               <p>The Bones are faſtned together either by <hi>Articulation</hi> or Joynting; or by <hi>Symphyſis</hi> or growing together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Articulation</hi> or <hi>Joynting</hi> is with motion, and that either <hi>obſcure</hi> (which others cal neuter or doubtful Articulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) as that of the Ribs with the Vertebrae, alſo of the Bones of the Wriſt and Pedium; or <hi>evident</hi> looſe and manifeſt, and it is called</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diarthroſis,</hi> of which there are three ſorts:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. <hi>Enarthroſis</hi> Inarticulation, which is when there is a great quantity both of the Cavity of the Bone receiving, and of the Head of the Bone which is received: as in the Articulation of the Thigh with the Huckle-bone.</item>
                  <item>II. <hi>Arthrodia,</hi> is where the Cavity receiving is ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, and the Head received flat: as is that of the lower Jaw with the Bone of the Temples.</item>
                  <item>III. <hi>Gigglumos,</hi> when the ſame Bone both receives, ſo that contiguous bones do mutually enter one into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And it is done three manner of waies:
<list>
                        <item>1. When the ſame bone is received by one bone which receives the ſame again mutually; as we ſee in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Shoulder-bone with the Cubit.</item>
                        <item>2. When one bone receives and is received of another, as in the Vertebrae. For the Vertebra being placed in the middle, receives the upper and is received by the lower.</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="337" facs="tcp:41352:112"/>3. In manner of a wheel, as that of the ſecond Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra of the Neck with the firſt; where upon the Axel-tree as it were of one Vertebra, another is turned and wheeled about,</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>By <hi>Sumphuſis</hi> or growing together, Bones are faſtned, when the Connexion is without motion, and two Bones do only touch one another, or approach mutually one to another, as in the former.</p>
               <p>And this growing together is either without a medium or with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Without a Medium:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Rhaphé</hi> a Suture as in the Skul.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Harmonia,</hi> which is a joyning of Bones by a ſingle Line, ſtreight, oblique, or circular: as in bones of the upper Jaw and the Noſe. And ſo all Epiphyſes in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are joyned.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Gomphoſis</hi> that is to ſay Nailing, when one Bone is faſtned into another as a Nail in a Poſt, as the Teeth in the Jaw-bones.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe three ſorts <hi>Galen</hi> and others following him, have comprehended under <hi>Synarthroſis</hi> as the Genus or kind. But they are out: becauſe Bones thus joyned have no motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet peradventure they may ſome waies pertain to <hi>Synarthroſis,</hi> becauſe of the firmneſs they afford to the parts of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With a Medium</hi> there is alſo a threefold growing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Bones, by reaſon of a threefold body coming between as the Medium:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A <hi>Griſtle</hi> and the conjunction is called <hi>Sunchondro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</hi> as in the Bones of the lower Jaw, and the Share<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones.</item>
                  <item>2. A <hi>Ligament</hi> and it is termed <hi>Sunneuroſis,</hi> as is ſeen in the Union of the Huckle-bone with the Thigh bone.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Fleſh</hi> or a Muſcle, and it is called <hi>Suſſarcoſis,</hi> as in the <hi>Os hyoides</hi> with the <hi>Scapula.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Bones is hard, but not with dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in an healthy State, but with a ſhining fattineſs. to which others joyn an acid or ſharp ſpirit and a vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Salt, in which regard they eaſily take fire and are burnt inſtead of Wood, as the <hi>Rogus</hi> of the Romans or their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral-fires did witneſs [<hi>and our Engliſh Bonefires,</hi> for anciently (and yet in the<note place="margin">A Bonefire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly what.</note> North) they kept their Bones of Beef &amp;c. til an occaſion of Triumph, and then brought them out for joy to make Bone-fires] other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would eaſily be broken, as we ſee in calcined Bones, and in that old Woman, whoſe Members would break at the leaſt touch, as <hi>Nic. Fontanus</hi> relates in his Obſervations. And <hi>Galen</hi> tels of ſome bones that would turn to Sand and Duſt, like rotten wood, which is the effect of drineſs.</p>
               <p>The Leſs this <hi>Hardneſs</hi> of the Bones is, the better do broken bones grow together and unite.</p>
               <p>But in Perſons that are come to years, they do not truly grow together, nor are regenerated, but are as it were glewed together, by the coming between of another ſubſtance like Glue, which they term <hi>Callus. Galen</hi> cals it <hi>Porus.</hi> Now a <hi>Callus</hi> ſomtimes happens beſide the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Nature, through overgreat plenty of Aliment and bad Nutrition: viz. when by a boney callus, the three upper Vertebra's of the Neck are ſo glewed together as they ſeem to be but one bone: or when the firſt Vetebra is glewed to the Skul; and ſuch perſons cannot expreſs their conſent or diſſent, by moving their Head forwards or backwards as the manner is.</p>
               <p>There is a greater hardneſs in ſome Bones than in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as the Thigh, &amp;c. But other Bones are ſofter, as of the <hi>Os Spongioſum,</hi> the laſt bones of the Fingers &amp;c. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius, Ruellius, Hollerius</hi> have found all the bones ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturally ſoft, that they might be bowed like Wax, and that chiefly by the venereal Pox, witneſs <hi>M. Donatus.</hi> The <hi>Cartilago inſiformis</hi> proves ſomtimes ſo ſoft and flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, that it falls, of which ſee <hi>Codronchius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>parts of the Bones</hi> are ſolid or Hollow, yet <hi>Plinie</hi> tels us, that there were ſome that lived whoſe bones were ſolid, without any hollowneſs, who are by him called <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nei,</hi> and that ſuch perſons are known, in that they never ſweat nor thirſt. which <hi>Salinus</hi> avouches of one <hi>Lyddanus</hi> a Syracuſian. But both theſe Authors can ſomtimes drop leaſings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cavities</hi> are either <hi>within</hi> where the Marrow is, which cavities nevertheleſs are not every where conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; or <hi>without</hi> at the <hi>joyntings;</hi> which hollowneſſes if they are deep, they are called <hi>Cotúlai</hi> or <hi>Cotulides</hi> (not <hi>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſolid parts of the Bones are three.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> and principal is called <hi>Os,</hi> and is the hardeſt part, ſeated commonly in the middle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is by the Greeks called <hi>Apophyſis,</hi> alſo they term it <hi>Probolen</hi> and <hi>Ecph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>in</hi> &amp;c. the Latines call it <hi>Proceſſus, Productio, Projectura, Extuberantia &amp;c.</hi> It is a part of a bone, not only touching as <hi>Epiphuſis,</hi> but continued bunching out beyond the plain ſurface of the Bone: ſuch as many are in the Vertebra's of the Back, alſo in the lower Jaw-bone.</p>
               <p>Its chief <hi>Uſe</hi> is for the original and Inſertion of parts, as Muſcles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> is <hi>Epiphuſis,</hi> or <hi>Appendix, Adnaſcentia, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditamentum;</hi> being a bone growing upon a bone, by a ſimple and immediate Contact, though not with ſo very plain a Surface, but a little mutual Ingreſs of Heads and Hollows, like <hi>Ginglumus,</hi> though without motion.</p>
               <p>The Subſtance of the <hi>Epiphyſes</hi> is rare and looſe, being at firſt for the moſt part griſtly; but in perſons grown to years, it is hardned, and turns to a bone: yea in elderly perſons, the <hi>Epiphyſis</hi> is ſo united to the bone, as if they were but one contined bone,</p>
               <p>At the Ends of the <hi>Epiphyſis</hi> a Griſtle is placed.</p>
               <p>But all Bones have not theſe <hi>Epiphuſes</hi> growing to them: yet there are divers of them; as in the <hi>Scapula,</hi> on the Bones of the <hi>Tibia</hi> and the <hi>Fibula,</hi> viz. on each ſide, at the Tree and Foot &amp;c. Alſo the Tooth of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Vertebra, the <hi>Rotator magnus,</hi> the <hi>Appendices Styloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> are <hi>Epiphyſes.</hi>

                  <item>2. They ſerve for firmneſs, for that Baſis is moſt firm which is broadeſt and largeſt.</item>

Moreover a Griſtle hath no Marrow, no Cavities nor Caverns.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Matter</hi> according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is the ſame with that of the Bones, from wich he wil have them to differ only gradually.

                  <item>2. To defend the parts from external injuries. For they are not eaſily bruiſed and broken, becauſe they are hard and not friable, nor are they eaſily cut and ſqueezed as the ſoft and fleſhy parts. Hence the extream parts of the Noſe are griſtly. Hence Griſtles are joyned to the Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone and Ribs, to defend the Heart and Lungs, and the Griſtle <hi>Enſiformis,</hi> to defend the Midriff and the mouth of the Stomach.</item>

               <p>Their <hi>Situation</hi> is various, for Griſtles are found in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry parts, in the Eye-lids, Noſe, Ear, Larynx, Wezand, Spine, Cheſt, Ear-lets, of all and every of which in their places.</p>

                  <hi>Chap. III.</hi> Of Ligaments in General.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>LIgamentum</hi> a Band or Tie, is by the Greeks called <hi>Súndeſmos.</hi> The Ancients, as <hi>Hippocrates, Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> ſomwhere, call it <hi>Nervum</hi> and <hi>Nervum colliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> a Nerve, and a twiſted Nerve or Nerve tied together; becauſe in ſhape and colour it counterfets a Nerve: and otherwiſe the term Ligament, may in a large ſignification be applied to any part, which faſtens divers parts together. Alſo <hi>Galen</hi> calls the beginning of a Muſcle <hi>Ligamentum,</hi> part whereof is thought to turn to a Tendon. All theſe are improper acceptations. I ſhall now decipher a Ligament properly ſo called.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Efficient</hi> is the Ligament-making Power.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Matter</hi> is a clammy roaping part of the Seed.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is, like a cord to bind together the parts of the body, eſpecially the Bones, and ſo to keep them together, in the Head, Cheſt, Back, and Limbs, that they may not be diſlocated or diſpointed.</p>
               <p>Becauſe of its moſt ſtrong cleaving thereunto, a Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament is ſaid to ariſe (though it be indeed made of the Seed) from the Bone primarily, ſomtimes from a Griſtle, griſtly bone or Membrane: and its ſaid to be <hi>inſerted</hi> into a Bone, Griſtle, Muſcle, or ſome part. Or if you would rather have it ſo; Ligaments grow among the Bones, of in the Bones.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Situation.</hi> Some are without among the Bones, as the griſly Ligaments ſo called, which are thick and commonly round: others are wound externally about the bones which are thin and membranous.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Figure:</hi> ſome are broader which Anatomiſts term membranous Ligaments, as hath been ſaid; others are longer, which are called Nervous Ligaments. And they call them ſo becauſe of their reſemblance, not as if a Ligament were truly membranous or nervous. So they are called membranous, which being broad and thin do compaſs the Joynts, alſo which are wrapt about Tendons and Muſcles.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Subſtance</hi> is ſolid, white, bloodleſs, ſofter than a Griſtle, harder than Nerves and Membranes: for it is as it were of a middle Nature betwixt a Griſtle and a Nerve.</p>
               <p>It is without Cavity, Senſe or Motion. It was to be without Senſe, leaſt it ſhould be alwaies pained in Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; when as the Ligaments are made ſomtimes longer and ſhorter, that is to ſay, are contracted and extended. Some nevertheleſs wil have membranous Ligaments to feel, but they muſt grant it to be ſo, by means of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes and not of their own proper ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>For this ſubſtance of theirs is as <hi>Galen</hi> tels us diviſible into fibres viſible to the ſight, which experience alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms.</p>
               <p>Now this Subſtance is in ſome places <hi>ſofter</hi> and more membranous than in others, as in all Ligaments wel-neer, which go round about the Joynts; and among theſe, it is ſofter about the Joynt of the Shoulder, than about that of the Hip; and yet ſofter where it goes about the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyntings of the fingers. But in other places the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is harder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as it were in part griſtly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are in ſuch places termed griſtly Ligaments; and they are ſuch as lie concealed among the Bones, as that which goes from the Head of the Thigh, into the Hip-joynt.</p>

               <p>Its <hi>Situation</hi> and <hi>Magnitude</hi> follow the Brain and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond thereunto.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is natural or non-natural and depraved.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>natural</hi> figure is <hi>round,</hi> that it may hold the more, yet a little longiſh towards the fore and hindparts, where it branches forth, that it may contain the Brain and Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let;

on the ſides it is flatted, but more towards the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts; and therefore the hind-part of the Head is of greater capacity than the forepart: of which <hi>Albovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> King of the Longbeards or Lombards made a Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cup for Feſtival daies, as <hi>Diaconus</hi> relates in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>

                     <p>5.

And ſuch a figure of Heads, is at this day more frequent in ſome Countries than in others.</p>
                     <p>But now I wil add other figures which I have obſerved in many Skuls, eſpecially in <hi>Italy.</hi>

               </list>
               <p>And thus I make <hi>twelve ſhapes</hi> of the Head in all, one <hi>natural</hi> and eleven <hi>depraved,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Skul is boney, to ſecure the ſoft Brain. But in Children new born it is ſofter then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and in ſome places cartilaginous and membranous, eſpecially about the Sutures, and moſt of all in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and upper region of the Head: and all theſe for the making the Birth more eaſie, that it might give a little way when it is preſſed. But the Subſtance of the Skul is.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Thick, not thin, that it may more ſtrongly reſiſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal injuries.</item>
                  <item>2. Rare not compact. 1. Leaſt it ſhould weigh too much. 2. That it might contain Juyce for nouriſhment,</item>
                  <item>3. That vapors may exhale.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now this Subſtance of the Skul doth conſiſt as it were of a double boord or plate. It is ſeldom ſimple and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle without a <hi>Meditullium</hi> or middle matter, as I found it in the Diſſection of a certain perſon, and ſeldomer hath it three boords, But for the moſt part two as hath been ſaid. ſome call them <hi>Diploas,</hi> the outer whereof being unhurt, the inner may be hurt. And each of theſe plates is commonly poliſhed within and without, ſmooth and thick. Hence it appears how thick the Skul is, ſeeing it is every where in a manner double.</p>
               <p>I ſay in a manner or wel-neer, which others do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: for in ſome places the Skul is ſingle, thin and tranſparent. without any diſtance of plates. And therefore ſome Chirurgeons<note place="margin">The Error of Chirurgeons</note> are deceived, who in taking away the firſt Plate do think they muſt ſo long cut and prick, til blood comes out. The external Plate is ſomtimes eaten off by the Venereal Diſeaſe, and ſomtimes it ſprouts forth Gums by force of the ſaid Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>But the rarity or light compoſure of the Skul appears from that <hi>middle ſubſtance</hi> between each Plate, which they call <hi>meditullium.</hi> This Subſtance, I ſay, is rare or light, lax, and receives little Veins: which alſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> knew, who therefore warns us that the Skul is very eaſily inflamed, and therefore when the Trepan is uſed, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron muſt divers times be dipt in Milk and Water.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surface</hi> of the Skul, is external or internal.</p>
               <p>The <hi>upper External</hi> is ſmooth and even; the lower or Baſis, is rough and uneven, by reaſon of ſundry Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and Proceſſes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>upper Internal</hi> is hollow, ſmooth; ſave that it hath the Marks of Veins, and certain Cavities, wherein the <hi>dura mater</hi> grows: the lower is very uneven by reaſon of divers protuberancies.</p>
               <p>And every where there are frequent <hi>holes</hi> in the Skull, very ſmall and placed without order, through which ſmall Veins and Arteries paſs, to the inner Cavity of the Bones, and the <hi>dura Menynx.</hi> But ſomtimes they are not to be found.</p>
               <p>At length, that we may come to the parts of the Skull, we muſt know that the Skul doth not conſiſt of one only Bone, leaſt by one wound the whole Skul ſhould be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces; but of divers: which are faſtned together by the Sutures, of which in the following Chapter.</p>
               <p>And ſome are Bones of the Skull, others of the Jaw.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bones</hi> of the <hi>Skull</hi> in perſons grown to ripe years are <hi>eight.</hi> whereof two <hi>are common</hi> to the Skul, with the upper Jaw-bone, viz. the <hi>cundiforme</hi> and the <hi>ſpongioſum.</hi> But there are <hi>ſix proper</hi> bones, which make up the Skul it ſelf: One of the <hi>Forehead</hi> (in new born Children two) two of the Forepart of the Head, one of the <hi>Hind-part</hi> (in an Infant four) two of the <hi>Temples.</hi> And there lie hid in the Auditory paſſages, other <hi>ſix</hi> bones, on each ſide three little ones: the <hi>Hammer,</hi> the <hi>Anvil,</hi> and the <hi>Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup,</hi> to which a fourth is added called <hi>Orbiculare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus there are perpetually in the <hi>Skull fourteen</hi> or ſixteen Bones.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of the Skul:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To be the Manſion and Bulwork of the Brain, which of it ſelf is ſoft.</item>
                  <item>2. That through it Vapors may paſs.</item>
               </list>
               <p>To the former uſe, its thickneſs and hardneſs is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient; to the latter its rarity and Sutures.</p>
               <p>On the Skul of a Man ſomtimes <hi>Horns</hi> grow, one whiles ſoft, another while hard like Rams Horns; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fixed to the Skul, otherwhiles to the Skin, and they proceed from a thick, clammy and melancholick humor. There are examples hereof in <hi>Paraeus, Thuanus, Hildanus, Renodaeus, Zacutus, Severinus,</hi> and others; I alſo ſaw two horns, one at <hi>Padua</hi> in a Nunn, another at <hi>Purme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raem</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> in an old Woman, which was ſufficiently long and hard: I have diſcourſed of theſe Horns in my new Obſervations <hi>de Unicornu,</hi> of the Unicorn.</p>

                  <hi>Chap. V.</hi> Of the Sutures of the Skull.</head>
               <p>A <hi>Suture</hi> is a ſort of connexion reſembling the putting together of two Saws, tooth within tooth, or the making up of a Garment of many torn patches.</p>
               <p>Such Sutures there are many in a mans Head: for an Head is ſeldom found without any Suture, ſuch as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:41352:114"/>
ſaw, and at <hi>Helmſtadt</hi> and the<note place="margin">An Head with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sutures.</note> Monaſtery of <hi>Heilbrun</hi> in <hi>France</hi> ſuch an one is ſhewed (as a Rarity) and is every where to be met with.</p>
               <p>And ſuch perſons have not their Heads ſo liable to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal injuries, but very much to inward Infirmities, becauſe tranſpiration is thereby made more difficult. By which diſtinction, <hi>Falopius</hi> and <hi>Columbus</hi> do reconcile <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Robertus Conſtantinus,</hi> the former of whom wrote, that the Head which had no Sutures was moſt liable to ſickneſs, the latter that the Head without Sutures was more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>Somtimes through Age and Drineſs, the Sutures do ſo grow together in aged perſons, that they are ſcarce to be ſeen; whereas they are in the mean ſeaſon, more viſible in young perſons. Somtimes the coronal ſuture is only ſeen obliterated; but the temporal do hardly vaniſh, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept all the other be firſt defaced.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Situation</hi> of the Sutures, is the ſame in a Woman and in a Man, contrary to what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought; nor doth it vary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect<note place="margin">The Error of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
                  </note> of figures, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> would have it, unleſs very rarely. For <hi>M. A. Severinus</hi> obſerved between the ſaggiteal and Lambda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhion'd ſuture, another over and above of a triangular ſhape, and neer the end of the ſaid Sutures in another Skul, a new oval Suture.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Sutures of the Head of a certain Fool, did vary in figure, which all ſtuck up with one Hillock as it were. which I ſaw in three Epileptick Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at <hi>Naples,</hi> eſpecially in the coronal Suture, which did ſuggeſt a new Cauſe and Cure of the Epilepſie or Falling-ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sutures</hi> which knit the Bones of the Skul, are ſome of them called true and proper, others falſe and Baſtard Sutures.</p>
               <p>They are termed <hi>true,</hi> which meet together like the teeth of Combs, or like Saws, put together, which I have ſomtimes ſeen after Contuſion movable, which alſo in moſt Skuls that are over dried in the Earth is common. They are alſo looſe in Children, and therefore they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in Hydrocephalic or Water-headed Children, as I ſaw in a Boy at <hi>Hafnia,</hi> like to that which <hi>Severinus</hi> pictures out in his Treatiſe of Impoſthumes, and <hi>Donatus</hi> deſcribes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>baſtard</hi> Sutures are joyned like Scales and Tiles on an houſe-top, and therefore they are termed <hi>Squamoſae conglu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>inationes,</hi> Scaley-conjunctions, and may rather be termed joynings, ſeeing they are more like to an Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia then a Suture.</p>
               <p>There are three <hi>true</hi> ones.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Is the foremore, and is called <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Ancients wore<note place="margin">The coronal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture why ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> Crowns on that part of their Heads.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe it hath ſome reſemblance to a Crown or Circle:</item>
               </list>
               <p>For from the Temples it aſcends on both ſides, athwart, to the top of the Head. The Arabians call this ſuture <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cualis</hi> and <hi>Puppis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its <hi>Uſe</hi> is to joyn the Fore-head bone with the bones of the Hinder-head, and to diſtinguiſh them therefrom. The place of the coronal Suture is ſound out in a living perſon, either by carrying the hand upwards from the Wriſt along the Noſe, or by drawing a Thred out from Ear to Ear, and another croſs the ſame from the end of the Noſe.</p>
               <p>2. That which is oppoſite to this, is behind and in the <hi>Occiput</hi> or Hinder-head. 'Tis called <hi>Lamdoeidès</hi> the Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da-ſhap'd, from the Greek letter A. ſome call it <hi>hupſiloï<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> from the letter <hi>upſilon,</hi> alſo <hi>prorae ſutura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This aſcends obliquely, from the Baſe of the Hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, to each Ear, grows into an Angle. Somtimes when the Hinder-head is large or otherwiſe, 'tis divided by a tranſverſe ſuture, ſimple, or double: ſomtimes there is a double triple Suture as if a greater triangle did contain one or two leſſer Triangles within the ſame: where the Bones ſo comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">The triangular Bones of the Skul.</note> are termed <hi>oſſicula triangularia,</hi> the little three-cornerd bones, commended, in the Falling-ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe triangular bones, <hi>Olaus Worm</hi> a rare man, found others in the Lambda-like Suture, which perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both the Boards of the Skull, obſerved as yet by very ſew. Three for the moſt part on the right, as many on the left ſide, differing in magnitude, figure and ſituation, which alſo are accurately diſcerned and diſtinguiſhed in Infants. The <hi>loweſt</hi> is ſeen at the <hi>Proceſſus mammillares,</hi> the <hi>middlemoſt</hi> a little higher, ſcarce half a Fingers breadth, the <hi>third</hi> a little further diſtinct from the ſecond. <hi>Pavius</hi> found only two like to theſe, circumſcribed with their little Sutures or ſeams, which he doubts whether he ſhould refer them to the Bones of the <hi>Occiput</hi> or the Bregma.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Shape</hi> they are Various, Triangular, Oblong, Oval. ſomtimes in living perſons I have obſerved them to grow ſo high, that I could Feel them with my Fingers, as if they had been Epiphyſis or ſomewhat growing upon the Bone.</p>
               <p>All are <hi>larger</hi> on the left ſide. but the greateſt exceeds not the Nail of a Mans thumb.</p>
               <p>They appear more diſtinct on the inner &amp; Concave ſide of the Skul, than in the outward and convex, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are all more cleerly diſcern'd when the Skul is taken away,</p>
               <p>We are nevertheleſs to obſerve that theſe bones of <hi>Worm</hi> do in divers Skuls vary, both in Number, Magnitude, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, Situation; ſo that ſomtimes there are four, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two, and in a Right line only, ſomtimes in the very Juncture of the Sagittal with the Lambda-ſhap'd; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo in the Scaley temporal Sutures.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Uſe,</hi> I believe, is 1. That the Sutures being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged thereabouts, might afford a more free paſſage for Excrements.</p>
               <p>2. That the Skul being made up of more bones, might be more ſafe in Blows and Contuſions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of this Lambda-like Suture, is to diſtinguiſh the bone of the <hi>Occiput</hi> or Hinder-head, from the bones of the Temples, and the forepart of the Head.</p>
               <p>3. In the middle betwixt theſe two is the Suture ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The <hi>Connexion.</hi> The Hammer by its proceſs ſticks faſt to the Membrane of the Drum, beyond the middle, like a tail turned back; the head whereof is articulated into the Cavity of of the Anvil, having a ſmall Proceſs, that the Tendon of the <hi>Muſculus rotundus</hi> may be applied thereto; it hath alſo a longer Proceſs, but ſmaller, firſt obſerved by <hi>Caecilius Folius,</hi> to which another Muſcle is faſtened, which belongs to the external Ear. It reſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart upon the bony circle, with which perhaps it grows together in perſons that are of years, for commonly in Children it is only viſible, in others it is eaſily broken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its fineneſs, when the bones are taken out.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Anvil</hi> reſembling a grinding Tooth, lies under the Hammer, having beneath two proceſſes; the one ſhorter reſting upon the <hi>Os ſquamoſum,</hi> the other longer, ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the top of the Stirup or triangular bone, which reſts upon the Cochlea, till it is ſunk into the broad Baſis of the <hi>Feneſtra ovalis,</hi> or oval window, to which it is faſtned by a looſe Ligament, ſo that it may be lightly raiſed, but not moved upwards and downwards.</p>
               <p>Theſe three little bones, are <hi>joyned</hi> with a very fine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament, which is ſtretched over the whole Membrane, as the ſtrings over the bottom of a Drum.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Uſe</hi> of theſe little bones is not to make a ſound, but that the ſpecies of ſound being received, may paſs to the lower parts, and that there may be a paſſage for the excrements of the Ears. For the Stirrup ſhutting the oval or upper window, is moved by the Anvil (whereupon the window is opened, that the ſpecies or repreſentation of Sounds may paſs into the Nerve, and the Anvil being ſmitten by the Hammer, and the Hammer by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the Drum, through the impulſe of the external Air (which the Hammer hinders from being driven too far forwards) which while it is in doing, the membrane of the Drum is droven inwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becomes bunching out, whereby the inbred Air is affected, which wandring through the Cochlea cauſes, that the branches of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory

But in the recourſe, it is moved outwards, with the Membrane of the Drum, by that very little Muſcle found out by <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerius.</hi>

               <p>It is <hi>one Bone</hi> in grown perſons: but it is at firſt made of four which are afterwards united.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Proceſſes</hi> are ſundry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Outwardly</hi> there are two remarkable ones, at the ſides of the palate, cal'd <hi>Pterigoeides, aliformes,</hi> Wing-faſhion'd, becauſe they reſemble the wings of Batts or Flittermice, and are furniſhed with a longiſh Cavity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inwardly</hi> there are four little ones, on each ſide two, having the ſhape of a Turkiſh Saddle. and therefore this proceſs is termed <hi>Sella Sphaenoidis,</hi> the ſaddle of <hi>Os Sphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noïdes;</hi> in which proceſs being ſquare and broad, there is a Cavity to hold the <hi>Glandula pituitaria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the Saddle, there is a <hi>Cave</hi> full of little holes, that the inbreathed Air, may be elaborated to make Spirits, and that flegmatick excrements, may diſtill through the funnel, out of the Ventricles of the Brain.</p>

               <p>And this Jaw-bone in Mankind, is ſhorter and round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than in Brutes, for Beauties ſake, alſo it is immoveable as it is in Beaſts, ſaving the Parrot, the Phaenicopterus, and the Crocodile as wel that which lives in the water, as the Land-Crocodile; yet do they not move the upper Jaw only, but their whole Head withall being ſtraitly faſten'd thereto, as Vipers do, and the like is to be ſaid of the Parrot.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>lower</hi> Jaw-bone in Mankind and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is only movable, ſave in the Crocodile, which hath it ſo united to the Bones of the Temples, that it can no waies be ſtirred; but the Parrot moves both.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Connexion</hi> is without motion in the upper Jaw, by a Suture or Harmonie whereby it is joyned with many bones of its own, of which it is compoſed, and other bones placed round about; in the <hi>lower</hi> by way of <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondroſis,</hi> which is in the middle of the Chin.

               <p>THe <hi>lower Jaw-bone</hi> in grown perſons, conſiſts of one Bone only, in Children till ſeven year old of two, which are joyned together by way of <hi>Sunchondroſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is that of the Greek letter <hi>u</hi> or like a Bow.</p>
               <p>Its <hi>Subſtance</hi> is exceeding hard and ſtrong, that it may hold out in biting and chewing; within hollow, where Marrow is contained to nouriſh it and the teeth.</p>
               <p>It hath two <hi>Holes</hi> on each ſide, which go quite through the Jaw-bone like a Pipe, ſo that a briſtle put in at one hole will come out of the other.</p>
               <p>The one is more <hi>inward,</hi> hindermore and greater, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in a part of thoſe Nerves which we reckon to be the fift pare, to the Roots of the teeth, with a little Vein and Artery.</p>
               <p>The other is more <hi>outward,</hi> leſs round, by which a Branch of the foreſaid Nerve received in, is ſent out to the lower Lip.</p>
               <p>It hath ſundry <hi>Aſperities</hi> and <hi>Cavities</hi> for the Riſings and Inſertions of Muſcles.</p>
               <p>Alſo on each ſide two <hi>Proceſſes</hi> called <hi>Horns,</hi> carried up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One goes out forwards</hi> broad and thin, whoſe point or ſharp end is called <hi>Corone,</hi> into which the Tendon of the Temporal Muſcle is implanted. And therefore <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> counts the Luxation of the lower Jaw-bone dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>other</hi> hindermore, is carried backwards; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting a little bunch and is called <hi>condulodes,</hi> having a little Head coverd with a griſtly cruſt, under which there is a longiſh Neck.</p>
               <p>By this Proceſs the Articulation is made with the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bones, where yet another Griſtle is placed between the Cavity and the griſtly head, to facilitate the motion. Alſo a common membranous <hi>Ligament</hi> doth cover this Articulation.</p>

                  <item>1. They are harder than other Bones, that they may bite and chew hard things; and they are little leſs harder tha Stones, nor can they eaſily be burnt in the Fire, and whereas in the <hi>Sarcophagus</hi> or Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eating Stone, the whole body is conſumed in forty daies, the Teeth remain unimpaired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> writes that in them is the Seed of our future Reſurrection.</item>

                  <item>3.

                  <item>4. Hence, they receive Nerves into their Cavity which other bones do not.</item>

               <p>And look how much they wear away, ſo much are they ſtill augmented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which hence appears; in that if any Tooth fall out and grow not again, the oppoſite Tooth grows ſo much the longer, as the empty ſpace of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Tooth comes to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fallopius</hi> conſidering the praemiſes, and how new Teeth are thought to breed, he collects that the formative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty remains alive in the Teeth to extream old age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helmont</hi> counts the matter of the Bone not to be meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boney, but as it were of a middle nature betwixt Bone and Stone; becauſe the Teeth turn to Stone whatever kind of food ſticks long to them, be it Bread, Fleſh, Herbs, Fiſh, Apples, Beans, or Peaſe, &amp;c. But there is no petrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or turning to Stone, unleſs the things eaten be of a tartareous Nature, but only a drying, the moiſture being conſumed by the Spittle; nor are the Teeth made bigger by that addition, which ſomtimes is ſcraped off, ſomtimes turne to clammy filth.</p>
               <p>The Teeth <hi>are bred</hi> in the <hi>Womb,</hi> after<note place="margin">The Teeth are bred in the Womb.</note> the Generation of the Jaw-bones, twelve in each Jaw, or a few more, as I ſhall ſpeak hereafter touching their number, four Cutters, two Dog-teeth, ſix Grinders: which lie ſomwhat imperfect and concealed within the Jaws (for it is rare for an Infant to be born toothed) leaſt the child as it ſucks ſhould hurt the Nipple. And therefore in an Abortion, or a young Infant, ſmall teeth may be pulled out</p>
               <p>They break out of the Gums ſooner in Brutes (though <hi>Varro</hi> be otherwiſe minded as touching Horſes) becauſe they are ſooner capable of ſolid meat; in mankind at the ſeventh month or later, after the Child is a year old: and the upper ſooner than the lower, yet in ſome the loweſt firſt, and among the reſt,</p>
               <p>The <hi>fore-teeth in the firſt place,</hi> becauſe</p>

                  <item>2. They are leſs then the reſt.</item>

                  <item>4. Becauſe there is moſt need of them both to ſpeak with and to cut and bite the meat.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And at that time when the Teeth<note place="margin">Why Children are ſick of Teeth-bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> of Infants ſhoot forth, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> tels us that Feavers, Convulſions, Fluxes of the Belly ariſe, eſpecially when the Dog-teeeth come forth: becauſe when the Teeth make their way through the Gums, they torment more than pricks in the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>Theſe Teeth have a <hi>Subſtance</hi> boney, hard, and hollow where they break out, but in their hinder part they have a ſoft ſubſtance, covered with a thin and tranſparent Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:41352:118"/>And about the ſeventh and fourteenth yeer, <hi>other Teeth are wont to break out</hi> (the<note place="margin">Why and when young ones looſe their Teeth.</note> former falling away) in both the Jaws ten, four Cutters, two Dog-teeth, and four Grinders. And the former fall out in the fourth, fift, and ſixt year. becauſe the holes grow wider, and therefore the Teeth being at that time ſoft, do grow looſe and fall out. <hi>Nicephorus</hi> in his Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dreams ſaies, that for a man to dream he looſes a Tooth another comes in the Rome, betokens gain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Joy. If their Teeth do not ſhed, the latter Teeth come out at new holes, the upper commonly on the outſide, the lower on the inſide, as there were new ranks of Teeth. More frequently they ſpring out on the ſides and augment the number.</p>
               <p>But theſe Teeth are not bred anew without the Womb: for then likewiſe<note place="margin">Whether new Teeth are bred out of the womb?</note> Membranes, Nerves, Veſſels and Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might be bred anew: but the ſeeds of them lie within the Jaws. For <hi>Euſtachius</hi> and <hi>Riolanus</hi> have obſerved ſome ſmaller Teeth at the back of the reſt which fall out, a very thin partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being removed which is found between the two ſorts of Teeth. But a rare caſe it is for Teeth to breed again, after many years and in old age. As <hi>Thuanus</hi> relates of a man that was an hundred yeer old: in our <hi>Fionia</hi> a man of an hundred and forty years of age, had new Teeth. <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaw an old Man and Woman of ſixty three yeers of age, whoſe Teeth grew again with ſuch pains as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have when breed they teeth, which was no token of their long living, for both of them died that yeer. Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> hath the like Example touching an old Man.</p>
               <p>But now let us ſpeak of the Teeth in grown perſons.</p>
               <p>The Teeth are <hi>ſeated</hi> in the Compaſs of the two Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones, in Mankind, ſhut up within his mouth; in a Boar they ſtick out, as alſo in the Whale-fiſh cal'd <hi>Narhual</hi> in our <hi>Greenland;</hi> which ſends out an exceeding long wreathed Tooth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut of the left ſide of his upper Jaw, which is commonly taken for the Unicorns horn, and is yet of great value among Noble Men and Princes.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Magnitude</hi> they come ſhort of the Teeth of other Animals, becauſe of the ſmallneſs of Mans mouth. And in Mankind ſome have greater, others leſs.</p>
               <p>They vary in <hi>Figure.</hi> In Man they are of a threefold figure: Cutters, Dog-teeth, and Grinders, as ſhall be ſaid in the following Chapter; ſave that <hi>Fontanus</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a certain Man, that they were all Grinders which he had. In Creatures that <hi>chew the Cud</hi> they are double; Cutters and Grinders. In Fiſhes they are in a manner all perfectly ſharp, excepting one kind of Whale, which the <hi>Iſlanders</hi> call Springwall, whoſe teeth are blunt, but broad.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Surface</hi> is ſmooth and even.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Colour</hi> white, and ſhining, unleſs negligence, Age, or ſickneſs hinder.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Number</hi> is not the ſame in all Men, for to let paſs rarities, viz. that ſome men are born with one continued tooth in their upper Jaw-bone (which they relate of <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi> and a certain Groenlander brought hither in the Kings Ships) alſo of a double and tripple row of teeth, ſuch as I have ſeen in ſome Fiſhes, and ſuch as <hi>Lewis the thirteenth</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> had, and which <hi>Solinus</hi> writes of <hi>Mantichora,</hi> and is known of the <hi>Lamia,</hi> which hath five ranks, ſtrangely ordered, and among them exceeding ſharp teeth, reſembling the ſtones called <hi>Gloſſopetrae,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Columna</hi> took the teeth of a Lamian turned to ſtone, to be the <hi>Gloſſopetrae</hi> or precious Stones of <hi>Malta</hi> ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, of which I have ſpoke elſwhere. In a Sea-wolf, I have obſerved a double rank, the former of ſharp teeth, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of grinders, cloſe joyned together, which poſſeſs the lower part of the Palate. A man hath ordinarily but one rank in each Jaw-bone, and <hi>twenty eight</hi> in all, ſomtimes <hi>thirty,</hi> in the upper Jaw ſixteen, in the lower fourteen; but for the moſt part <hi>thirty two,</hi> ſixteen in each Jaw.</p>
               <p>But this number is ſeldom changed, ſave in the grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which ſomtimes are on each ſide five, ſomtimes ſour; otherwhiles five above, four beneath, or five on the right, and four on the left ſide, or contrarily.</p>
               <p>A great number of teeth argues length<note place="margin">Many teeth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue long life.</note> of life, few teeth a ſhort life, according to <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> And rightly. For the rarity and fewneſs of teeth is bad as a <hi>Sign</hi> and a Cauſe: for it argues want of matter, and the weakneſs of the formative faculty. As a <hi>Cauſe:</hi> becauſe few teeth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well prepare the meat, and ſo the firſt digeſtion is hurt, and conſequently the ſecond. But we muſt underſtand that this prediction holds for the moſt part, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> well diſputes againſt <hi>Cardan</hi> in his 271. Exercitation. For <hi>Auguſtus</hi> who lived ſeventy ſix years, is ſaid to have had thin, few, and ſcalie teeth; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Foreſtus</hi> who lived above eighty years.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Connexion</hi> is by way of <hi>Gomphoſis,</hi> for they ſeem to be fixed in their holes as nails in a poſt. Alſo they are tied by ſtrong <hi>Bands</hi> unto their neſts, which bands ſtick to their roots; and then the Gums compaſs them, of which before.</p>
               <p>The <hi>outer Subſtance</hi> is more ſolid and hard, not feeling; the <hi>inner</hi> is a little more ſoft, endued with ſenſe, by reaſon of the neighborhood of a Nerve and Membrane, and hath in it a Cavity, larger in Children then Elder perſons, and compaſſed about till they be ſeven years old, with a <hi>thin Scale</hi> like the Combs of Bees, and full of ſnotty matter; in grown perſons the humor being dried up, it is dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
               <p>This Cavity is cloathed with a <hi>little Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Veſſels</hi> are carried to this Cavity, by the holes of the Roots of the Teeth.</p>

Hence much light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſhineing blood, comes ſomtimes from a tooth that has an hole made in it, and ſomtimes ſo as to cauſe death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Little Nerves</hi> tender and fine, are carried to them from the firſt pare, according as we reckon, which go through the Roots into the Cavity, where they are ſpred abroad within, and by ſmall twigs mingled with a certain muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous Subſtance ſound in the middle of the teeth.</p>

               <p>IN reſpect of their threefold Shape, their Situation, and Office, there are in Mankind <hi>three ſort</hi> of <hi>Teeth:</hi> The <hi>Fore-teeth,</hi> the <hi>Dog-teeth,</hi> and the <hi>Grinders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Fore-teeth,</hi> from their Office which is to cut the meat, are termed <hi>Inciſores</hi> and <hi>Inciſorij Cutters,</hi> alſo <hi>Gelá<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinoi</hi> the laughing teeth, becauſe in laughing they are firſt diſcovered.</p>
               <p>They are placed before, in the middle of the reſt, in each Jaw four (ſome have only two in a Jaw, as large as four) broad and ſharp like Swords, ſhorter then the Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth, and fixed in their Sockets with ſingle Roots; and therefore they fall the ſooner out, eſpecially the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. After theſe follow on either ſide</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dog-teeth,</hi> ſo called, becauſe of their ſharpneſs, hardneſs, and uſe; for what the former cannot cut theſe do bruiſe and grind. They are commonly termed the Eye-teeth, not as ſome think, becauſe they do almoſt touch the circumference of the Eye, ſeeing they hardly reach the lower part of the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ps of the Noſtrils, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a portion of that Nerve which moves the Eye, is carried unto them, and they are deeply rooted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is counted dangerous to draw them, alſo when they are pained, the Eye-lids do pant a little.</p>
               <p>Theſe teeth are two in each Jaw, on each ſide one, broad and thick in their baſis, and<note place="margin">Why Men have few dog teeth.</note> ſharp above.

               <p>And theſe Bones of the <hi>Spina</hi> are divided into ſeven Vertebrae of the <hi>Neck;</hi> twelve of the <hi>Back;</hi> five of the <hi>Loins,</hi> and five or fix of the <hi>Os ſacrum;</hi> to which is added the <hi>Crupper-bone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Vertebrae are hollowed, to contain the Spinal Marrow, they were to be <hi>many,</hi> not one, both for Motion which ought to be made forward and backward; alſo that the hurting of one might not draw the whole Spine into conſent. The Father of <hi>Nic. Fontanus</hi> ſaw five Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae or Whirle-bones of the Spina in a cluſter like a round ball, in the Body of a Porter that carried burthens. And <hi>Pavius</hi> hath obſerved that in decrepit old people theſe Vertebrae grow together into one, the moiſture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dried up, and the intermediate Ligaments hardned, which he repreſents by a Picture. <hi>Tulpius</hi> ſaw the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone in a Boy divided into two parts, and <hi>Salmuth</hi> hath ſeen it broke aſunder in perſons that were hanged.</p>

               <p>The Figure of each Vertebra above and beneath, is plane and broad, that luxation may not eaſily be cauſed, round within, convex and bunching out; but in the neck broader and more even, by reaſon of the Wezand and Gullet reſting thereupon.

               <p>The <hi>two firſt</hi> are joyned by Ligaments to the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the Head, that they may ſtick moſt cloſe to the Head, and have ſomwhat peculiar to themſelves, which the other five have not.</p>
               <p>I. Is termed <hi>Atlas,</hi> becauſe it ſeems to bear the Head up, which reſts upon the<note place="margin">Why the firſt Vertebra has no Spine?</note> two hollows thereof.

It <hi>hath no Spine</hi> or <hi>ſharp Point,</hi> leaſt the two ſmall Muſcles of the Head which ariſe from the ſecond Vertebra, ſhould be hurt when the Head is ſtretched out.</p>
               <p>It hath a thinner, but more compact <hi>Subſtance.</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, and is not received: and therefore it hath its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity covered with a Cartilage, to receive the tooth of the following Vertebra.</p>
               <p>II. Is called <hi>Epiſtropheus</hi> from turning: for out of the middle of its Body, there riſes an Appendix (others call it a Proceſs) round and oblong, like a Dogs tooth, about which the Head with the firſt Vertebra is turned.</p>
               <p>Hence that Appendix is called a tooth; yea and the whole Vertebra is by <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erates</hi>

But I conceive there was a greater number of Bones and Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in that Daniſh Boy, who had a Tail growing out at his Rump.</p>
               <p>Their Connexion is looſe, and in Women looſer then in Men, that they<note place="margin">The Os coccygis may be looſned.</note> may give way.</p>

               <p>2. In the time of Womens Travel, that the cavity may be more wide. And therefore ſome conceive that this Bone only gives way in the Birth, though <hi>Pinaeus</hi> be againſt it, and that the Pains of Women in Travel depend upon the Concourſe of little Nerves in that place. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in ſitting it comes forwards, and of its own accord returns into its place.</p>
               <p>This Bone in Men bends more inward to ſuſtain the Inteſtinum rectum; in Women outwards, becauſe of the Neck of the Womb, and that the Cavity might be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>This Bone being hurt or broken, exceeding great, pains are raiſed, as the Stories related by <hi>Amatus</hi> and <hi>Donatus,</hi> do witneſs. <hi>Hofman</hi> believes it is of no uſe, but is only the mark of a tail, as the Nipples in Men are only the ſigns or marks of Duggs.

               <p>THe OS INNOMINATUM or NAMELESS BONE, which ſome term OS COXAE or ILIUM, the Flank-bone, conſiſts of <hi>three Bones, Ilium, Pubis,</hi> and <hi>Iſchium</hi> joyned together by Griſtles, till the ſeventh year it appears di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by a threefold Line, but in grown perſons tis one.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Os Ilion</hi> ſo called, becauſe it contains the Gut Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, is the firſt part, which is the uppermore and broadeſt, knit to the Os ſacrum, by a common membranous and moſt ſtrong Ligament, although a Griſtle alſo comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween.</p>
               <p>Its ſemicircular and uneven Circumference, is termed <hi>Spina Oſſis Ilij,</hi> whoſe inner part hollow and broad, is termed <hi>Coſta,</hi> the Rib; the outer part formed with une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Lines, is termed <hi>Dorſum,</hi> the Back.</p>
               <p>This Bone is larger in Women, and its Spine is drawn more out ſidewaies, that<note place="margin">Why the Os I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium is larger in Women?</note> the Womb of a Woman with Child may better reſt upon it. And therefore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child do a little complain of this Part, as if it were pulled aſunder from the Os ſacrum and other neighbouring Parts to which it cleaves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Os pubis</hi> or <hi>Pectinis,</hi> the Share-bone, is the ſecond middlemore and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more<note place="margin">The Share-bones are looſned in Child-birth.</note> Part; which Bone is joyned to the Bone of the other ſide, by way of Sunchondroſis, that is to ſay, by a gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle coming between; which in Women is twice as thick and looſe or wide as in Men, that theſe Bones in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth may be (not diſlocated or disjoynted, but) looſned and made to gape, when the Child ſtrives to come forth. But now and then when the Childs greatneſs, or the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of the place requires, the Share-bones are pulled aſunder, as, beſides the Authority of the Ancients, <hi>Paraeus</hi> and <hi>Riolanus</hi> have obſerved in the Diſſections of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-women, &amp;c. and it is largely proved in the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Controverſies of my <hi>Father Bartholinus:</hi> But this is not alwaies ſo, namely when the Child is ſoft and apt to bend it ſelf and comply with the ſtraitneſs of the place when the way is ſlippery, the Bones much widened, &amp;c. for then the looſning of the Griſtle does ſuffice.</p>
               <p>But whether the Share-bones are moved is another queſtion. <hi>Joh. Cajus</hi> affirms they are moved by help of the right Muſcle of the Belly. <hi>Spigelius</hi> alſo ſaies they are moved after a peculiar manner upwards, whiles the Body roules in the bed, the Legs being lifted upwards <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olanus</hi> proves that the Share-bones are moved, not alone, but with the Hip-bone, by help of the ſame Muſcles, this I ſay he proves by the Venereal Embracements, in which theſe Parts are moved; by the going of ſuch whoſe Legs are cut off, and laſtly by dancing.</p>
               <p>But ſome doubts do as yet make me ſcruple this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe <hi>Cajus</hi> himſelf confeſſes, that the Share-bones (I add the reſt) are not moved of their own Nature, but by the bending of the Back-bone.</item>
                  <item>2. Theſe Bones being joyned together by Symphyſis, can have no motion, which <hi>Riolanus</hi> himſelf confeſſes.</item>
                  <item>3. I have aſſigned another Uſe for the right Muſcles, above in Book the firſt.</item>
                  <item>4. Theſe ſeeming Motions of the Bones, are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to them, but are motions of the Thigh or Back, whoſe motion they follow. For in the Examples alleadged, any man may experiment in himſelf, that both his Thighs and Back are moved; alſo he may by his hand perceive, that both the Muſcles of the Thigh called <hi>Glutaei,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adjacent Muſcles are moved.</item>
                  <item>5. They ought to be immoveable, becauſe the upper Parts reſt upon them as on a Foundation, and we reſt by ſitting upon this Part.</item>

               <p>OS ISCHION or the Hip-bone is the third part, which is lower and more outward, wherein is a large and deep Cavity, (they call it <hi>Acerabulum,</hi> the Saucer, and <hi>Pix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> the Box) to receive the large Head of the Thigh-bone, which if it fall out, either by reaſon of ſome internal hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, or outward chance, a Luxation or Semiluxation is thereby cauſed.

               <p>Others call this bone <hi>Os Gladiale</hi> or <hi>Enſiſorme</hi> the <hi>Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> or <hi>Sword-faſhion'd</hi> bone, becauſe of the ſhape of a Sword or rather ſuch a Dagger as was uſed by the Ancients: for it is <hi>convex, long</hi> and <hi>broad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its <hi>Subſtance</hi> is partly bony, but fungous and red, partly Griſtly.</p>
               <p>It conſiſts of <hi>divers bones,</hi> not of one, as is commonly ſeen in old Men, the diverſity of its bones appears, when you remove its Membrances. In Infants it is wholly griſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, excepting its firſt bone. Moreover, the upper bones are ſooner made than the lower, and the middle parts, than the outmoſt: ſo that in concluſion, eight bones are found in the Breaſt of a Child, which after ſeven years grow together, and become fewer, ſo that in grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there are ſometimes three, ſometimes four, ſometimes more bones. But the firſt and laſt remain in grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as in Children; but the middle ones growing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the number of bones comes to vary in that place.</p>
               <p>Theſe Bones are diſtinguiſhed by tranſverſe lines, and are knit together by <hi>Sanchondroſis;</hi> for the Griſtles are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed like Ligaments.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>uppermoſt bone,</hi> is large and thick, plain and uneven, of an Halfmoon faſhion above, repreſenting the joyning of a Dagger blade into the haft, ſome term it <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulum</hi> the <hi>Throat-pit,</hi> others call it <hi>Furculam</hi> the little fork.</p>
               <p>It hath on each ſide an <hi>hollowneſs</hi> in the upper part, to

               <p>And another Hollowneſs within engraven in the middle, that it may give way to the deſcending Trachea or We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is more narrow and hath many hollowneſſes on each ſide to receive the Griſtles of the Ribs.</p>
               <p>The third is yet leſs, but broader than the ſecond, and ends into the Griſtle<note place="margin">The Cartilago Enſiformis.</note> which is termed <hi>Kup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The lower part is articulated to the Cubitus and Radius, where there are two <hi>proceſſes;</hi> the <hi>External</hi> which is leſs and cruſted with a Griſtle; the <hi>Internal</hi> having two Hollows; repreſenting a Pulley, whereby the Cubit being joyned by way of <hi>Ginglymos,</hi> may be bent to a moſt acute angle, but not extended beyond a right line.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Boats</hi> of the <hi>Cubit</hi> are two, ſhorter than the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and having Appendixes on either ſide, reſting mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally one upon another, and joyned one to another by a Membranous Ligament.</p>
               <p>The firſt being lower, greater and longer than the other, is termed <hi>Ulna, Cubitus,</hi> by the barbarous Writers <hi>focile ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus;</hi> the other being upper and leſſer, is termed <hi>Radius,</hi> or <hi>focile minus.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In the middeſt of theſe is a great Cavity or Hollow, like an half Circle, whence 'tis called <hi>Sigmocides</hi> from the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sigma ſo ſhap'd of old by the Greeks. It hath as yet another ſmooth external lateral Cavity, for the head of the <hi>Radius.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In the lower part it is articulated</hi> with the Wriſt, both by a Griſtle going between, as alſo by an acute proceſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore termed <hi>Styloides, Bodkin-like;</hi> whence a <hi>Ligament</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes, which faſtens the Cubit to the Wriſt-joynt.</p>
               <p>The other Bone cal'd <hi>Radius</hi> is more oblique or crooked, and is a little diſtant from the other in the middle, where a thin <hi>Ligament</hi> comes between: but above, the Ulna re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Radius; beneath, the Radius receives it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>upper part</hi> thereof is articulated with the outward part of the <hi>Brachium,</hi> by way of <hi>Diarthroſis,</hi> whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the forward and backward motion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>lower</hi> is articulated with an Appendix with the Wriſt-bone, at the greateſt Finger.</p>

               <p>And theſe Ligaments ariſing from the lower proceſſes of the Radius and Cubitus, do ſerve for Articulation.</p>
               <p>But there are other <hi>Ligaments,</hi> which are tranſverſe and ſhaped like rings, for to ſtrengthen and ſafely to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Tendons, the <hi>internal,</hi> containing the tendons of the Muſcles which bend the Fingers; and the <hi>external,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Tendons of the Muſcles which extend the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which Ligaments or Bands, though they ſeem to be one, may be divided into many.</p>

               <p>THe chief men in Church and Commonwealth have in all Ages contended about Primacy: but learned Men have in no Age more ambitiouſly ſtriven who ſhould ſeem moſt learned, then at this preſent time. And to attain their deſire very many are not afraid to aſſiſt themſelves by Calumnies and other worſe Arts. No man can publiſh in Print, or communicate to his Friend any writing, which ſome account excellent, but he preſently meets with a Detractor who will prick, cut, and tear him moſt cruelly. Now for a man to ſeek no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe by his Cares and Labours, but Envy and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mind, is extream madneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:41352:125"/>Theſe Cauſes have (I confeſs) hindred me from ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying your frequent Requeſt; and beſides, becauſe I am not willing to determine of thoſe things, which long experience of years cannot either prove, or ſufficiently limit. Howbeit you continue your Requeſt, and I am much aſhamed, alwaies to deny you. Alſo a certain learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man hath impoſed a neceſſity upon me, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to diſcover to others my opinion concerning the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood. For certain Theſes hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been diſputed concerning the Motion of<note place="margin">The occaſion of this writing</note> the Blood, my ſelf being Preſident of the Diſpute; though the Defendant truly profeſſeth in his ſaid Theſes, that they are his own, yet he hath undertaken to tax and blame them, as if they were mine. And although that young man need not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of thoſe Theſes, yet I would not have another mans Theſes, though diſputed when I was Preſident, to be accounted mine. Neither can he be ignorant of the Reaſon, who is acquainted with my Liberty in Diſputing, or the Cuſtome of our Univerſity.</p>
               <p>Now therefore take my Opinion of the Motion of the Blood, as follows.</p>
               <p>That ſome hot blood which leaps out of the great Arteries being opened is<note place="margin">What Blood it is which is moved?</note> thinner, more rare and of a more bright colour, than that which flows out of the Veins when they are opened: yet, I will not therefore ſay, that the Arterial Blood differs formally from the Venal, Blood: for the Arterial Blood may differ as aforeſaid from the Venal, becauſe it comes reaking hot as it were from the fire, and abounds with greater ſtore of Spirits, as we ſee boyling Milk differs from it ſelf being cooled, for the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reaſon: for that Blood which is in the ſmaller Arteries, and ſo farther from the Heart, is obſerved to differ leſs from the venal Blood. And when we have taken Blood out of the greater Arteries, yea, out of the Heart it ſelf of a living Creature, and from the ſame Creature, have taken ſome out of the Veins, and have let then, both grow cold and congeal, we could never obſerve any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them. So that we can ſee no other, but that the Arterial Blood is of the ſame kinde with the Venal.</p>
               <p>Some few will have, that the venal Blood is of two kinds, one which is contained in the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> another in the <hi>Vena porta.</hi> But we cannot ſee any difference of theſe Bloods either when they are included in their veſſels, or when they are let out: and that Reaſon doth teach as much we ſhall ſee anon.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, we may likewiſe conceive another ſort of Blood, which being made of Chyle in the Liver, hath not received any further perfection in the Heart. And we are little concerned to know the Nature thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſee it continues ſuch but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little while. So that we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire<note place="margin">That it is only one kinde of blood.</note> into the motion of <hi>only one ſort of Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Blood may be <hi>moved</hi> either in <hi>that part of the Vein</hi> or <hi>Artery wherein it is contained,</hi> or <hi>out of that part into another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>one part of a Vein or Artery,</hi> the Blood is not diſcerned to move up and<note place="margin">It is not moved up and down in the Veſſels like boiled water.</note> down, like boyling water, neither when it is received into a Veſſel, nor when let out of a living and hot Body; nor yet in the Artery it ſelf, if it being on either hand tied, ſhall be opened in the upper part betwixt the two Ligatures. Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, when we have many times cut off the point of a living Heart, and ſet it upright, we have found the Blood to be hot, but never to boyl.</p>
               <p>But that the Blood is moved <hi>from one part of an Artery or Vein into another,</hi> is<note place="margin">But it is moved o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For Blood is contained in the Veins of the furtheſt parts of the Body, which ſeeing it is not bred there, it muſt needs come from ſome other place. And it is evident enough, that in living Creatures, the Blood flows out of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> into the Heart and out of the Heart into the <hi>Aorta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that this ſame <hi>whole Motion of the Blood</hi> may be by us the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,<note place="margin">Which motion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to underſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tain,</hi> and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thereof.</p>
               <p>I have often ſeen ſolid <hi>Meat</hi> in Dogs hold the ſame order in the Stomach, juſt as it was eaten by the Beaſts; unleſs the Stomach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtended with too much Drink, did make the Meat to float, and ſo to change its order and ſituation.</p>
               <p>The Meat which the Stomach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, although it be but two ounces,<note place="margin">That meat which is firſt eaten hath the firſt place in the Stomach.</note> it evidently imbraces the ſame round about; juſt as we ſee folded purſes contract themſelves about a Bullet or round Ball within them, alſo the upper and lower Orifice are both ſhut: which<note place="margin">The Stomach cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraces the ſame.</note> by making an hole near the ſame, and putting in your little finger, it is eaſie to try. But the lower Orifice notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when we finde it perfectly ſhut, ſeems rather to be fallen together, than ſtraitly cloſed, that upon the ſmalleſt preſſure it may let the Chylus paſs by. Alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times when the Stomach and its Orifices are weak, they fail in their natural cloſeneſs, and upon ſearching are found looſer.</p>
               <p>The meat retained in the Stomach, as thoroughly moiſtened with the Liquor<note place="margin">It is moiſtned with the moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</note> of our food, Drink and Spittle: and it quickly becomes porous and Spun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie: becauſe as is moſt likely the ſaid Liquor hath drawn out and ſuckt into it ſelf ſome of the ſubſtance of the Meat.</p>
               <p>A while after it is cut and torn as it<note place="margin">It is cut and minced by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid humour.</note> were into very ſmall particles, both that of thin and that of groſs Subſtance, yea, in Dogs the very ſhells themſelves of Eggs: which doth queſtionleſs proceed from ſome acid ſharp humour that hath in it a diſſolving power. So we finde by experience that the Stomach burthened with the quantity or groſſneſs of meat, doth find it ſelf eaſed, by taking a little Vinegar, Juice of Citrons, Oyl of Sulphur, or Vitriol. Nor let any man aſſign the Cauſe thereof to Spittle or Choler belching back into the Stomach, when he ſhall ſee Bread ſteeped ſome hours in hot Spittle or the Gall of an Ox, by them not diſſolved, moreover in an hundred Dogs or more which I have cut up on purpoſe alive, I found Choler flowed back into the Stomachs of onely two of them, one of which had eaten nothing for three daies, and in his Stomach, which was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to behold, there was a Cholerick froath ſo thick and full of bubbles, as that we ſee on the Suds of ſuch as waſh in Lye.</p>
               <p>Now I conceive this acid humor comes from the Spleen into the Stomach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">Which comes from the ſpleer.</note> there is no other part in the body which we can perceive to be ſharp or acid: and becauſe upon ſwallowing a bit of boyled Spleen eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus the Meat being mixed in its<note place="margin">Afterward it is changed into Cream.</note> ſmalleſt particles with the Liquor, in tract of time by concoction it comes to the conſiſtence of thin Barley-cream: which when it hath attained, then at laſt it is thruſt into the Guts.</p>

               <p>Milk and Broaths in the day time are perfectly digeſted in an hours ſpace or<note place="margin">How ſoon or late it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctèd and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed.</note> ſooner, and if ſomewhat elſe hinder not, they are then alſo diſtributed; which the voiding of Urin alone, after them, doth evidently ſhew, without any Diſſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Herbs are more ſlowly changed. Bread in reſpect of Digeſtion ſeems to be of a midling Subſtance, we finde in the firſt hour and half very little changed; in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing hour it is rare and light, juſt like a wet Spunge; when that hour is paſt, it is divided into very ſmall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and mixt ſo with the Drink, that all appears liquid, and ſoon after it is moſt of all digeſted, and at laſt as much of the Braad as is digeſted, between the fourth and fift hour after its eating, is by the Stomach forced through the Pylorus, into the Guts. But ſome of the ſaid Bread ſtaies behind, which by little and little is pertectly digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as alſo if any other meat were eaten with the Bread of harder digeſtion than it: which meats I have obſerved to be digeſted in this order. Firſt Beans and Peaſe, then Fiſh, then Fleſh which is perfectly digeſted and thruſt out of the Stomach between the ſixt and ſeventh hour: Beef between the ſeventh and eighth: yea, and the membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous parts of the Animals are longer in digeſtion, as alſo the ſhells of Egs; I have ſeen Bones that have abode in the Stomach unto the third day, during which ſpace they were become like Griſtles.</p>
               <p>Yea, and in the parts of theſe very meats, oft times great variety is ſeen, as<note place="margin">All at once or by piecemeal.</note> of Bread and Fleſh, though they ſeem whole in the Stomack, yet ſome portion though very little, is diſtributed ſometimes the firſt hour, unto the Milky Veins.</p>
               <p>So that whatever is digeſted, doth not at all expect the digeſtion of the reſt, nor is ſtaid by that which is undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, but preſently ſlips out, and is carried into the Guts: yea, and you ſhall ſeldome finde a Dogs Stomach empty, although he have not eaten in ſixteen hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Now I could eaſily make all theſe Obſervations in Dogs, which I cut up alive, at ſeveral diſtances after they had eaten their Meat.</p>
               <p>In the Guts the <hi>Chyle</hi> is of an Aſhco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and is ſeldome coloured by the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs<note place="margin">Being digested it is diſtributed into the Guts and milky Veins.</note> of Choler: and preſently now from the Duodenum it begins to enter the milky Veins of <hi>Aſellius,</hi> nor doth this entrance ceaſe in any of the Guts as long as any Chyle remains in the ſaid Guts, ſo that the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum</hi> or Arſe-gut it ſelf, is endued with milky veins, which are many times ſeen to look white by the afflux of Chyle. And that we may not think that ſame milkie<note place="margin">See the Figure of the milky Veins, <hi>pag.</hi> 563.</note> juyce comes elſewhere than from the Guts, I have bound theſe milky Veins inſerted into the Body of the Guts, and obſerved that from the Cavity of the Guts to the Ligature they are evidently full and ſwoln, but from the Ligature towards the Meſentery they wax empty and fall in.</p>
               <p>But the Chyle hath never been obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enter into any Vein in the body of<note place="margin">Not through the Meſeraick veins</note> the Stomach, nor any Meſeraick Vein, nor yet the Blood being by the binding of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na porta</hi> (whereof the reaſon ſhall hereafter appear) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly augmented in the Meſeraick Veins, hath ever been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ined the milky Veins only to carry Chyle, and the Stomach and Meſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Veins only to carry Blood.</p>
               <p>The Chyle in the milky Veins is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies though it proceed from Aſh-colour'd<note place="margin">Alwaies white.</note> Chyle in the Guts or ſuch as is dyed yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by Choler.</p>
               <p>By theſe Milky Veins the Chyle goes<note place="margin">By one Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued paſſage of the milky veins.</note> upwards, after what manners, is not very eaſie to ſay. This ſeems to me moſt probable, which I obſerved in great and lean Greyhounds; that ſome of the milkie Veins do go right on, to the <hi>Ramus Meſentericus,</hi> ſome into the <hi>Vena porta</hi> it ſelf, others into the hollow parts of the Liver, and very few do ſometimes end in the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> near the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgents. For theſe Animals have not that ſingle ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel in the beginning of the Meſentery, which <hi>Aſellius</hi> hath termed Pancreas, and which is wont to obſeure the paſſage of theſe Veins; but they are furniſhed in that place with ſmaller kernels, for the moſt part five in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which being diſtant by a man feſt ſpace one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through that ſpace they afford free paſſage to ſome milky Veins. But ſeeing that above theſe kernels, there are fewer branches of the milky Veins (and ſome of them greater) than beneath, I am apt to believe, that neer thoſe kernels, the milky Veins are divided into branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and that the ſaid kernels ſerve, as elſewhere in the body, to accomodate the divarication or branching of Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
               <p>Sometimes alſo I have been ſhewed milky Veins, which entred into the<note place="margin">Not to the Spleen.</note> Liver, but when in the preſence of the Shewers, I accurately examin'd the matter, we found them to be Nerves.</p>
               <p>The Chyle being carried through<note place="margin">But to the Liver.</note> theſe milky Veins is mixed with the Blood in the <hi>Ramus Meſentericus,</hi> in the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> and in the very <hi>Liver</hi> alſo it ſelf: for in what place ſoever you tie the milky Veins, they alwaies ſwell, becauſe they are hindred from paſſing the Chyle to theſe parts, and the Ligature being looſed, they manifeſtly infuſe the ſame into thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>The Branches of the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> in the Liver although in ſundry places they are knit to the branches of <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> yet are they never opened into a great branch of <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> but the ſmalleſt branches of <hi>Vena por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> do transfuſe this Chyle mixt with Blood into the ſmalleſt branches of the <hi>Vena cava;</hi> as is eaſie to obſerve in the Liver blown up when the Fleſh is taken off, and it ſwims in water. And that the ſame happens to the reſt of the Chyle mingled with the Blood, will be hereafter manifeſt.

Now this Blood, becauſe it can come from no other place, muſt needs come from the <hi>Vena arterioſa</hi> hither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonardus Botallus</hi> a moſt learned Man, at the end of his Book <hi>de Catarrho,</hi> ſuppoſeth he hath found another way, by which the Blood may continually goe, out of the right, into the left Ventricle of the Heart. <hi>A little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the coronal Artery</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I found a paſſage viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough, nèar the right Earlet, which<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> goes immediately and right forth into the left Earlet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This paſſage unleſs it be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the <hi>Vena cava</hi> to the <hi>Vena ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terioſa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">But not through the foramen ovale.</note> which we call <hi>Foramen ovale,</hi> or another paſſage which I have ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found in a Sheeps Heart, as big as a Wheat ſtraw, going with a crooked paſſage from one Earlet to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; unleſs, I ſay, it were one of theſe, I know not what for a paſſage it was.</p>
               <p>And as for that <hi>Ovale foramen Eg-faſhion'd-hole,</hi> it is not every where alike ſhut up, and oftentimes there is a very thin and tranſparent little Membrane growing in the middle thereof, which with the ſmalleſt touch of a Probe is eaſily broken, but it is very ſeldom upon any occaſion found open, in grown perſons. And the Blood flowing through the <hi>Arteria Venoſa</hi> out of the Lungs, doth faſten the Membrane placed before that hole, ſo that even when it doth not grow to, hardly any thing can paſs that way.</p>
               <p>But that ſame oblique paſſage which I have ſeen in a Sheeps heart, doth many times pierce deep into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Earlet, but is very ſeldom carried into the other Earlet. And I conceive it was given the Earlet for its Nutrition, it not being wont to receive branches from the <hi>Coronaria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from ſuch things as ſeldom happen, we cannot conclude any thing touching thoſe things that conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to paſs: for Nature frequently ſports her ſelf in the Fabrick of the Heart. So in the <hi>Septum Intermedium</hi> or partition wall of an Oxes Heart, in the upper part accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the length of the Heart, ſometimes I have found a Cavity, opening at the left Ventricle, about the point, which was as long and large as a mans Fore-finger. The like whereunto poſſibly <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaw, when in his 3. <hi>de partibus</hi> Chap. 4. he ſaith the greater ſort of Animals have three Ventricles in their Heart. For the greateſt Animals that are, have but two Ventricles, as I obſerved in the Diſſection of a young Whale.</p>
               <p>So that the Blood cannot be thought to go ordinarily any other way, then through the Lungs into the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart.</p>
               <p>The Blood being thus caried into the<note place="margin">And thence into the Heart, the Arteria aorta, and the reſt of ſmall Arteries.</note> left Ventricle of the Heart, goes from thence to the <hi>Arteria aorta,</hi> the middle and ſmalleſt Arteries: for they being bound in living Anatomies, do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſwell towards the Heart, and towards the extream parts they fall in, and the Ligature being looſed, they evidently ſend the Blood to the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parts of the Body.</p>
               <p>The Blood out of the ſmaller Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries<note place="margin">Out of the Arteries the Blood by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men mouths.</note> may enter into the Veins; for the Arteries have a way open into the Veins, by the common mouths of one opened into another,. And to the intent we might be ſure that Blood may paſs by thoſe mouths, we have freed the Vein and Artery in the Foot of a dead Dog, from ſuch things as are wont to hinder their being ſeen, and we emptied the greater crural Vein, and bound it in the flank, leaſt any Blood might flow in that way, and in the Knee we bound both this Vein and its neighbouring Artery: and then with our fingers we forced the Blood in the Iliack Arteries, as far as to the Knee, and ſo we emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied the crural Artery, but the crural Vein we ſaw mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly repleniſhed; and ſeeing into the Vein tied above and beneath nothing could come or a very little out of its branches and yet it was much filled, and the Artery quite emptied; we did gather that the Blood where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Vein was filled, was driven by the little mouths out of the emptied Arteries, into the ſaid Vein.</p>

we may juſtly conclude with <hi>Harvey,</hi> that the Blood which is communicated from the Arteries to the Veins and Parts, does a great part of it, return back again to the large Veins.</p>
               <p>Moreover, when we open a vein in a bound Arm, if you preſs that<note place="margin">The preſſing a Vein below the orifice in Blood-letting.</note> part of the ſwelling Vein with your Thumb which is neer the orifice, betwixt it and the Hand, or if you make ſuch a ligature as the former betwixt the Hand and the Orifice, you ſhall ſee that no blood will come forth; whence it ſeems to follow, that the blood comes from the Hand, which flows from the orifice. And ſeeing ſome pounds of Blood are drawn away by ſuch a Blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſo much cannot be contained in the lower part of the Veins of the Arm, it muſt needs come thither from the Arteries, which are not ſtopped by that Ligature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the orifice, as their Pulſe remaining entire doth teſtifie.</p>
               <p>But that we might ſee the ſame with our Eyes, we have divers times in<note place="margin">The Ligature of a vein in living Anatomies.</note> great living Dogs, freed the large Vein and Artery in the groyn, from ſuch things as did hinder their ſight; which may be eaſily done if they lie not beneath the Muſcles: and we bound the ſaid vein with a thred, and we obſerved that part of the Vein which looked towards the <hi>Vena ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> to empty and fall in, and the other part towards the Foot exceedingly to ſwel, ſo that in regard of its fullneſs, it ſeemed harder than the Artery it ſelf; but the ligature being looſed, the Blood preſently moved upwards, and the fullneſs and hardneſs of the Vein was very much aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And the Artery being bound, that part thereof did wonderfully ſwell, which was neareſt <hi>Aorta,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part more remote did fall in through emptineſs: nor did the Vein then bound evidently ſwell. And this we did many times and the effect was ſtill the ſame.</p>
               <p>And that we might have no ſcruple remaining, and might obſerve withall,<note place="margin">Diſſection of a Vein in living Creatures.</note> what was done within in the Vein, we did lift up the Vein and Artery being thus made bare, and under them we firmly bound the Thigh it ſelf, that the Blood might not move upwards or downwards, by any other Vein <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now immediately from that part of the Vein which was fartheſt from the Heart, the Blood flew out violently plentifully, and in a full ſtream. but that part of the Vein which was on the other ſide of the thred towards the Heart, did only drop out a few drops. whence it ſeemed to us to be a cleer caſe, that the Blood did not come downwards from the greater Veſſels, but upwards out of the ſmaller Veſſels into the greater. Eſpecially when having made another Ligature upon the ſame Vein fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Heart, betwixt the foreſaid Orifice and the Foot of the Beaſt, we ſaw no blood at all come from that Orifice, whence before it iſſued with ſuch violence. For we conceived thoſe drops which ſell from the Orifice neer the Heart, might proceed from Blood which poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was in the Vein when it was opened, or which it might continually receive from ſome ſmall Branch of the crural Vein ſituate above the thred; but this cauſe will anon appear more evidently.</p>
               <p>It is eaſie to make this experiment<note place="margin">The emptying of the Veins ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the Skin.</note> without any opening of a Vein in ſuch perſons as have the Veins of their Arms very Conſpicuous: In whom if you ſtop the Vein near the Hand with one Finger, and with your other hand force the blood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and the whole Vein wil appear empty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Seeing therefore the Blood comes out of the Hands and Feet, and they do not breed new Blood, ſo as to ſupply the whole Body therewith, we doubt not but that the Blood in thoſe parts continually and naturally goes into the Veins, <hi>and out of the leſſer Veins into the greater.</hi>

And doubtleſs, except in the Pleuriſie, the blood ſhould be revelled through the Arteries, there were no reaſon to be given why we ſhould for Revul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But what ſhal we ſay? Doth not the Arm after a ſort grow lean and fall away<note place="margin">Nor the Arms falling away occaſioned by a Ligature.</note> (and ſo other parts) when it is bound, as in thoſe who have it hollowed in a Fiſtula? becauſe the Vein being bound, the blood cannot deſcend as it ought, unto the lower parts of the Arm? There is no neceſſity that it ſhould be ſo. For all that may happen becauſe the Artery is bound. And really, this is an Argument that it is ſo, in that many times that Arm in which there is an Iſſue, is perceived to pulſe leſs and more faintly than the other; the influx of the blood and ſpirits, being in ſome meaſure hindred, by the the binding of the Iſſue. Yet ſome part may peradventure fall away by binding of a Vein alone; becauſe Nature cannot plentifully infuſe new blood through the Artery, ſeeing it cannot freely go back by the Veins. And though the Veins and Arteries do then contain ſtore of Blood, yet is it peradventure not very fit to nouriſh the parts as they ſhould be, but this wil better appear hereafter.</p>
               <p>It is nevertheleſs manifeſt, that in ſuch as have the <hi>Varices</hi> ſo called, the<note place="margin">Nor the Varices.</note> blood deſcends from the <hi>Vena cava</hi> to the greater, and out of the greater into the leſſer Veins. For that is eaſie to ſee in a Varix of the Thigh and Foot, and in the Haemorrhoids. But that motion of Blood may happen beſides Nature, becauſe the Veins being weakned do not ſend the Blood upwards, but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame; and becauſe the humors by that weight, do reſiſt the Natural motion upwards, and deſcend, and therefore being collected in great Quantity in the lower Veins, new Blood ſtill coming out of the Arteries; they cauſe their dilatation and conſequently a Varix. Thus artificial Fountains about thoſe places from which they aſcend, are moſt frequently obſerved to make clefts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at laſt drawn aſunder and torn by the Heavineſs of the Water, which ought nevertheleſs according to the Nature of Fountains to aſcend upwards. And it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether moſt likely that Varices are cauſed after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: becauſe humors in ſuch as have Varices, do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Vein, when they are violently moved in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, but when they have reſted after exerciſe; becauſe the humors can reſiſt a ſmaller motion and deſcend by their own weight.</p>

And the Heart as long as it hath any vigour left, expels ſomwhat at every pulſation: for the <hi>Arteria aorta</hi> being bound near the Heart, between the Heart and the Ligature, I opened the ſaid Artery, and I ſaw ſome Blood come out at every pulſe; till the Heart grew quite to languiſh, for then ſomwhat came away af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three or four pulſes only: becauſe ſo little was thruſt from the Heart, that it could not be moved upwards till ſome quantity of it was collected, nor paſs out at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per orifice of the Artery.</p>
               <p>Alſo I cut off the tip of an Heart and ſetting the ſame upright, I obſerved though the Ventricles were not full, at every pulſe ſomwhat was ſhed forth; which alſo <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> notes in his 2.

And if a man would determine by conjecture from what we have ſeen, how much may come out of the Heart of a Man in health at every pulſe, I ſhall not be againſt them who ſay that out of the Heart of a Man at every pulſe half an ounce of Blood is ſhed into the <hi>Arteria aorta.</hi>

But whether the Arteries do ſhed it immediately into the Ventricles, or into the branches which ariſe from the Ventricles, is not very eaſily diſcerned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the Arteries, are hardly diſtinguiſhed from thoſe little branches, ſeeing the Arteries alſo have only one Coat in the Brain: but I am apt to beleive, that the Arteries empty their blood, into thoſe little branches of the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, rather then into the Ventricles themſelves; becauſe I have obſerved thoſe veſſels which are inſerted into the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles to be greateſt near the ventricles, as branches are wont to be at their Original.</p>

Out of the right Ventricle it goes into the Vena arterioſa; but becauſe the Lungs do not breath, and therefore are not opened, they cannot receive the blood plentifully, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore they are not all in the extream parts of the Body, but ſome in the middle parts: and therefore we ſee in a Cripple whoſe limbs are cut off, the ſame moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the blood continued out of the Arteries into the Veins. Secondly it ſeems alſo poſſible that Blood may paſs out of the Arteries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">And through the Fleſh.</note> the Veins, through the fleſh it ſelf: for we ſee when a Vein is opened till the colour change, Inflamations fall, becauſe the Blood ſhed out of the Veſſels, is drawn out of the Fleſh. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the paſſage of the Blood this way is but ſeldome and in ſmall quantity.</p>
               <p>So that it is now, I conceive, clear, <hi>what the motion of the Blood is,</hi> and by<note place="margin">And that motion of the Blood.</note> what waies it is accompliſhed: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that we enquire, what <hi>kind of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is,</hi> and how it is performed.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved that this Motion of<note place="margin">Is continual.</note> the Blood out of the Heart into the Veins, from the Veins into the Heart, is <hi>continual</hi> never cleaſing, nor once ſtopped or interrupted for a moment of time. And the truth is, ſeeing the ſaid motion is made, as we ſhall ſee anon, becauſe the Heart receives and tranſmits, and ſeeing this motion laſts perpetually all the life long, the ſaid motion of the blood, cannot but naturally be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall.</p>
               <p>Alſo the motion of the Blood is quick, for an Artery or Vein being bound compreſſed, it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately<note place="margin">Quick.</note> ſwells and grows round and hard: and when the ligature and compreſſure are taken away, the blood is ſeen to be ſwiftly moved.</p>
               <p>But how ſoon the blood performs its Circuit from the Heart and to<note place="margin">So that the whole Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit or round is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in leſs than a quarter of an hour.</note> the Heart again, I cannot preciſely determine. We obſerve it is done ſooner by an Anaſtomoſis near the Heart, than by one off; nor will I be much againſt him that ſhall ſay the greateſt Circuit from the remoteſt parts of the body is performed in leſs than a quarter of an hour; for the blood paſſeth with exceeding celerity. Howbeit it goeth not ſo ſwiftly, as we ſee it leap out when a vein or Artery is opened, becauſe then it is moved in the free and open Air; but within the body it is compreſſed to lift up its veſſels, and to thruſt on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going blood.</p>
               <p>And therefore we ſee an Artery being cut open eſpecially if near the heart, is ſooner emptied than the heart can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it with new blood.</p>
               <p>But if this be true, why do Feavers return once in a quarter of an hour,<note place="margin">Nor do the Fits of Agues argue any other.</note> ſeeing the Fit ſeems then to happen, when the corrupt matter comes to the heart? whereas now ſome fits come every day, others every third, and ſome every fourth day. Truly, I will not deny, that it may fall out, that when the Corrupt matter comes to the heart, the Fit may happen, as <hi>Harvey</hi> hath an example thereof, in the 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chapter of his Book. But I do not think it is neceſſary, for ſome portion may ſlip out of the corrupt Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or ſome ſooty ſtream may ariſe, and go into the heart and ſo raiſe the Feaver, as moſt Feavers are ſeen to ariſe from the Inflammation of the Parts, which the Impoſthume being opened and the Quittor removed, do ceaſe. And as ſuch kinde of ſymptomatick Feavers, even ſo alſo may ſome intermitting Feavers and Agues happen, by reaſon of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome matter ſhut up, within or without the Veſſels, which by putrifying every day, every third day, or every fourth day, regurgitating or fuming into the large Veſſels, may bring the Fit.</p>
               <p>In continual Feavers I confeſs, whoſe<note place="margin">Nor the Exacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of Feavers.</note> matter is to ſtick to the larger veſſels, it is harder to ſhew a reaſon why there ſhould not be a Fit or Exacerbation at every Circuit of the blood. But I conceive I may alledg the ſame cauſe which is vulgarly given, why continual Feavers are not allwaies alike feirce; becauſe, though the matter be ſufficiently near the Heart, yet it doth not cauſe a Paroxiſm till it have attained a certain degree of putrifaction: and that the Fit laſts ſo long, till that putrid matter be evacuated, which touches the Heart, or ſends its Fumes thereto. But I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe no man, becauſe of the reaſon of the return of Ague-fits, which is altogether abſtruſe and unknown, will deny the motion of the blood to be very quick, which is a very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt thing.</p>
               <p>Beſides ſwiftneſs, the blood <hi>hath vehemence</hi> in its motion, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears<note place="margin">This motion is alſo vehement.</note> from what we have ſaid touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hardneſſe and Tenſion or ſtretching, which the Veins and Arteries acquire when they are bound: for nothing can be diſtended by a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Subſtance into an extream hardneſs eſpecially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, unleſs it be vehemently driven thereinto or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein. But this vehemence, of motion is chiefly near the Heart,<note place="margin">Not of like vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence in the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Veins.</note> removed from which it grows by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees leſſer and leſſer, ſo that the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Arteries in the remote parts, do not pulſe, unleſs ſome impulſe of blood greater than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary do happen, as we obſerve to happen in Feavers, therefore it is that the Veins are not ſeen to pulſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the impulſe of the Blood is leſs in them than it is in the ſmalleſt Arteries; and becauſe the Veins <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oyned to the Arteries by Anaſtomoſis, when they go from them, divide themſelves into more little branches and twigs than the Arteries do, for when Rivers are divided into divers Arms the force of the waters motion is abated. And therefore when ſome Arms of a Vein are ſhut, either by ſomething preſſing them, as in certain Tumors, or ſomewhat which ſtops them, as in the Varices, the blood ſlipping back by its own weight, the force of the bloods motion is then again obſerved, and the Veins are ſeen to pulſe: for I have often obſerved in the Veins which are tranſparent through the Skin, that moſt of thoſe palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the parts, which are thought to proceed from Winds, are nothing elſe but the puſſations of the veins.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the motion is more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Yet the ſame Quickneſs in both.</note> in the Arteries than in the Veins, it ſeems at firſt ſight to be ſwifter alſo <hi>in the Arteries than in the Veins</hi> juſt as Men, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and other Animals which move themſelves with great labour, and through miſtake judged many times to make the greater ſpeed. For the Blood forced through the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries cannot all paſs through the Anaſtomoſes, becauſe it comes out of a wide place into a narrow, and therefore it is accumulated in the Arteries, they are dilated, in which dilation they perſiſt a ſmall time, wherefore in the middle of the dilation and in the whole time of the reſt, that ſame force doth very little further the quickneſs of the bloods motion, which motion is in the mean time
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:41352:129"/>
more free in the veins, becauſe it comes out of a ſtrait in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a wide place, and is performed by more wayes. Now Reaſon doth teach us in this Caſe, that in this motion of blood, the ſwiftneſs hereof muſt be alike in the Arteries and the Veins; for as much blood as the Liver ſends to the heart made of new Chyle, and as much nouriſhment as the Arteries give to the parts, muſt be repayed, or the Heart will at laſt be void of all moiſture, which thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſenſe confirms, for the <hi>Vena cava</hi> pulſes ſo often, in that whole Tract from the Liver to the Jugulum, and therefore drives into the heart, as the Artery is obſerved to pulſe and therefore to receive from the heart. But we ſhall hereof ſpeak more anon.</p>
               <p>Howbeit in the Arteries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the blood is moved more<note place="margin">Yet of greater quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs when the Heart beats.</note> 
                  <hi>aimbly</hi> when the <hi>Heart drives it;</hi> from which Quickneſs it departs by little and little, when the Heart begins to reſt and is afterwards dilated. Yea and in the Veins themſelves, the motion of blood is more vehement and quick when the Heart pulſes; which as we have obſerved in live Anatomies, ſo have we often noted the ſame, when a Vein hath been opened in the Arm, in which the Veins were not much diſtended with the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Alſo the foreſaid palpitations of the Veins, ſeem to proceed from no other cauſe then that the Veins being ſtraitned by the Blood ſliding back, or by ſome other means, when the blood cannot by its force make it ſelf way, it lifts the Vein up, which falls again, when that forcible endeavour is abated or the Vein gives a freer paſſage to the Blood flowing through the ſame.</p>
               <p>But I do not conceive that the blood which is once carried, for<note place="margin">One portion of blood doth not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes go the ſame way.</note> examples ſake to crural Veins, is continually carried the ſame wayes, but that when it is returned to the Heart, it is mixt with <hi>that blood which comes out of other parts,</hi> and is ſo promiſcuouſly diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the parts of the Body: for ſo the parts may be the better nouriſhed, if they have alwayes new blood, out of which they may draw, that which may beſt ſerve to nouriſh and ſtrengthen them: ſo Plants do beſt grow, when they are tranſplanted into new Soils.</p>
               <p>This is the whole Manner of the Bloods motion: and alſo of<note place="margin">The Vital Spirits are moved with the Blood.</note> the <hi>motion of the Vital Spirits,</hi> ſeeing they are mingled with the Blood.</p>

And it is a very eaſie matter to bind the Nerves of the ſixt pare, which freely wander through the Cheſt.</p>

                  </gap>ip. In regard of which Motion if <hi>Hypocrates</hi> in the Beginning of his Book <hi>de Corde,</hi> cal'd the Heart a ſtrong Muſcle, he did truly after an elegant manner expreſs the manner of its Motion.</p>
               <p>When the Heart by its Conſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction<note place="margin">The Heart after its Conſtriction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to its Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate.</note> hath forced the Blood into the Arteries, it returns to its, Natural ſtate. For the point returns from the Baſis, as alſo the Baſis from the point, in thoſe Animals which have no paſſage into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> in their baſis; but the left and right ſide of the Heart, extends it ſelf towards the Ribs, and that ſide which looks towards the Breaſt-bone falls in, eſpecially
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:41352:130"/>
there where it anſwers to the Orifice of the Aorta, and then the whol Heart <hi>reſts</hi> and is found looſe and ſoft.</p>
               <p>And unleſs that upper ſide did ſettle and fall in, the Heart would be dilated in this return hereof to its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtate, as is eaſie to ſee and feel, when the heart is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected. But that upper ſide muſt needs fall in, leaſt the heart being emptied by foregoing conſtriction ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Vaccuum. But when out of Vena Cava and the Arteria Venoſa, new blood is forced into the heart, and the Blood contained therein is rarified by heat, then the upper ſide riſes: and the other ſides, as we ſaid before, remain extended. And ſo the<note place="margin">And then it is dilated.</note> heart is then in its <hi>dilatation;</hi> nor is there any other dilatation of the heart ſave this, to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>In the Particles of a live heart diſſected and taken out of the Bodie, there is no other dilatation then a remiſſion or ſlackening from Conſtriction. Indeed in thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles where conſtriction is ceaſed, there remains a ſeeing kind of Palpitation; but that is another kind of motion proceeding from the ſpirit conteined in the fleſh and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its way out; ſuch as may alſo frequently be ſeen in the muſcles whole or diſſected, in Creatures diſſected preſently upon their death.</p>
               <p>So that the Dilatation and Conſtriction of the heart happens after the ſame manner as that of other parts, the Stomach, Gutts, Bladder, Womb, which are diſtended by what is ſent into them, which when they have voided, they return to their naturall ſtate.</p>
               <p>Now we cannot better obſerve this motion of the Heart, then in thoſe Beaſts which have only one ventricle in their Hearts, or if they have two, when the Animals begin to languiſh, otherwiſe when the Creatures are ſtrong, the motion is hardly diſcerned becauſe of its Swiſtneſs; alſo becauſe the two ventricles preſent thoſe motions doubled; and becauſe the Cone of the right ventricle, ſeeing it is leſs high then the left, when it is drawn back to the Baſis, it makes an oblique motion.</p>
               <p>But let us return to our buſineſs, and let us ſee further how the blood<note place="margin">The Blood is driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en out of the greater into the leſſer Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> out of <hi>the Arteries near the Heart,</hi> is ſpread through the Arteries of the whol Body, now it is done by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Impulſe or driveing or any Artery being bound, at the Ligature it ſwels very much, and is ſtretched to an extream hardneſs.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the <hi>Heavineſs</hi> of the Blood furthers its motion downwards, and therefore the Heart ſeems to have been placed neerer the Head then the Heels.</p>
               <p>It is alſo likely that the Blood is drawn into all the Arteries, to the end that they<note place="margin">Yet it is drawn withall.</note> and their neighbouring parts may be nouriſhed with convenient Blood.</p>
               <p>But that the Arteries ſhould draw by<note place="margin">Not neceſſarily by dilatation of the Artery.</note> being widened, there ſeems no neceſſity: for the Blood may be driven forward on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by impulſe, and the Arteries may drive the ſame: for an Artery being broke and an Aneuriſma made in the Fleſh, the Aneuriſma in the fleſh, is percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to pulſe after the ſame manner as the Artery; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in manifeſtly the fleſh doth not draw the blood by dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the blood is driven into the ſame. A miſerable example whereof we latlely ſaw in the moſt expert Dr. <hi>Johannes Elemannus,</hi> in whom an Artery breaking, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuriſma poſſeſſed a fourth part of his Cheſt. And the like was obſerved by <hi>Riolanus</hi> in the 6. Book of his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shropologia</hi> chap. 12. And that indeed the pulſe of the arteries is cauſed by the Impulſe of Blood, the waving, creeping, piſmire pulſes ſeem to ſhew, and many others which manifeſtly imitate the motion of the Blood in the artery.</p>
               <p>True it is indeed, in that Book of <hi>Galen whether blood be contained in the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nor doth</hi> Galens <hi>experiment ſhew any other thing.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Arteries,</hi> in the laſt words it is aſſerted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that an hollow Reed being thruſt into the arteries, and the artery tied above the Reed, the artery doth not pulſe beyond the ligature, though the blood may be driven through the Reed. But I ſuſpect that place is mained and wants ſomwhat, becauſe after the manner there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, the operation can very rarely and hardly ſucceed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a free artery is there preſcribed to be opened out of which when it is open, every body knows what a world of blood leaps out, ſo that either the Creature will die, or through its weakneſs, no arteries at leaſt not thoſe more remote can pulſe.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the place is perfect, and that the operation ſhall ſucceed as it is there deſcribed, it may happen that the Creature quite languiſhing becauſe of the flux of Blood, the pulſe might be felt on this ſide the Reed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Reed being thruſt in, rendring the artery more narrow, might in part ſtop the blood, ſo that it might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily fill the artery and lift it up. So I have many times ſeen, arreries which ſhewed either a languiſhing or no pulſe, manifeſtly pulſing, when they were compreſſed not very far from the Heart. But <hi>Galen</hi> obſerved no pulſe beyond the Reed, becauſe through the Reed much narrower than the artery, the artery received little blood. And that ſuch a thing might eaſily happen, I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a Rabbit, into the <hi>Aorta</hi> whereof, it being tied on each ſide we thruſt a little Reed, but becauſe the ligature being looſed the Beaſt died, we thought it not worth the while to bind the artery above the Reed and we thought we ſaw ſome pulſe as far as to the Reed, but we could perceive none beyond the Reed.</p>
               <p>Moreover we could never make that experiment ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, becauſe it is not eaſie to find a convenient Artery, and when it is found and duly opened, the Creature moſt ſpeedily dies, either becauſe of Bloodſhed, or (which may ſeem ſtrange) by Convulſions.</p>
               <p>So that we can ſee no other, but that the Blood being forced may paſs through the Arteries, and that by it alſo the Arteries may be diſtended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor ſeems it neceſſary to call any other Cauſe to make the Arteries pulſe, ſeeing the forealleadged Cauſe may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Yet Nature is wont frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Yet Galen hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tokens that the dilatation of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries helps their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>De uſu pulſ.</hi> cap. 5. <hi>An ſanguis in Art.</hi> c. 8.</note> to call more aſſiſtances to the performance of her works then do indeed to us ſeem neceſſary, who cannot alwaies dive into her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets. So here, ſome tokens are obſerved by <hi>Galen,</hi> that beſides that dilatation they receive from the impulſe of the Blood, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries do alſo endeavor their own dilatation. That all the Arteries of the body both in ſound perſons and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in live Anatomies, do pulſe in one and the ſame moment: but nothing that is moved to diſtance, can be every where at one moment; and therefore not at the ſame moment make diſtention every where. The Guts when blown up by Anatomiſts, or Pudding-makers, are ſeen to be diſtended in the parts neer the Blower firſt, before the remoter parts are diſtended. True indeed it is, that the Arteries are not empts as the Guts, but they are diſtended being partlyfilled with blood: yet, ſeeing that blood which comes out of the Heart muſt thruſt forward that which is next it, and <hi>that</hi> again that which is next it, and ſo forward untill the Arteries be filled and diſtended every where, it doth not ſeem, though the motion be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed out of a wide into a narrow place, that it can be performed in one moment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> juſt as we ſee twenty ſtones which the Boys ſet in a row, the greateſt firſt; when the firſt is beaten down, all the reſt do not fall in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore we may ſuſpect, that the Diaſtole of the Arteries, is cauſed by the impulſe of blood, and by their own proper dilatation: and that both theſe cauſes contribute to the bloods motion.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo it appears, that this ſame<note place="margin">But the impulſe i here cauſed only by the Hart.</note> impulſe of the Blood is made only by
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:41352:131"/>
the Heart, nor does one part of the Arteries drive it into another: for that part which drives by conſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that cannot in the ſame moment be dilated, but all the Arteries are dilated in a moment.</p>
               <p>And thus the blood is moved through the Arteries; and out of the<note place="margin">Out of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries into the Veins, out of the ſmaller Veins into the greater</note> 
                  <hi>Arteries</hi> into the <hi>Veins,</hi> out of the leſſer Veins into the greater and the <hi>Vena ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> it ſelf, the blood is moved alſo by <hi>Impulſe.</hi> For any Vein being bound in living Creatures, it falls in, and growes lank towards the Heart, and it is filled in that part which is more remote from the Heart,</p>
               <p>And this ſame Pulſion to the Heart, ſeems to happen from any part of a<note place="margin">It is driven.</note> Vein, for a Vein bound or compreſſed in a living Arm it is not only ſttretched in the part remoter from the Heart, but<note place="margin">By every Particle of the Vein.</note> alſo in the reſt there of nearer the Heart it falls in and is emptied; which nearer part if you alſo tie that alſo will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended beyond the Ligature, and will ſwell. Now this Pulſion is cauſed by the Fibres whereof the Veins are conſtituted.</p>
               <p>We conceive nevertheleſs that the veins do alſo draw, leaſt they ſhould receive<note place="margin">And drawn.</note> the blood without choice, and that they may draw to themſelves that which is moſt uſeful: howbeit they ſeem to receive the blood more by Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion then by traction or drawing, becauſe the veins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound, are wonderfully diſtended.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Vena cava</hi> there is a certain Store-houſe of Blood, wherein blood is treaſured up for future Uſes, when it is more plentiful then that all of it need be ſent unto the Heart.</p>
               <p>And all theſe are Cauſes of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural motion of the blood. To which<note place="margin">So alſo by Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Chyle is moved out of the Stomach.</note> the <hi>cauſes of the motion of the Chyle,</hi> are not unlike: for the <hi>Stomach</hi> contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf by its Fibres, <hi>ſqueezes</hi> out as much Chyle as is digeſted, And by that preſſure it ſeems alſo to open the Pylorus: for there ſeems not to be any ſpontaneous motion in the Pylorus, ſuch as is in the Stomach or the Guts.</p>
               <p>The Chyle ſtaies not long in the <hi>Guts,</hi> but is preſently driven out <hi>by the conſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>

                  <hi>of the tranſverſe Fibres:</hi> and while many fibres, and which mutually follow one another, do act, the Chyle is preſſed, nor can it all ſlip downwards, whereupon ſome of the preſſed chyle ſlips into the milkie Veins; yet leaſt that the Chylus ſhould ſlip too ſoon to the Fundament, it is ſtopped by the conſtriction of the lower tranſverſe Fibre: and being thus ſhut, and compreſſed above and beneath, it is preſſed through the wrinkled Coat of the Gut, as it were through a ſtrainer into the milkie Veins. Now this ſame conſtriction of the tranſverſe Fibres, happens in all the thin or ſmall Guts, and in all the thick or round Guts, in a certain order, and at certain diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time.</p>

               <p>The Chylus in the <hi>Ramus meſentericus, Vena partae</hi> and <hi>Vena cava,</hi> being mingled with the blood, is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the ſame cauſe, which there as we have ſaid, does move the blood.</p>
               <p>Now the Chylus is carried by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar<note place="margin">Why not through the meſaraick Veins.</note> Veins, rather then by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaraicks which contain blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Meſaraicks being to admit blood, were to have their mouths opened into the Guts, through which the blood would eaſily have ſlipt into the Guts. Nor could the drawing Faculty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that inconveniency, which is here much obſcurer and much weaker then the expulſive Faculty.</p>
               <p>As this Motion of the Chylus, ſo alſo the circular motion of the blood hath its uſes and conveniences, of which the principal ſeem to be theſe.</p>
               <p>That by the continual paſſage ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<note place="margin">The motion of the blood ſerves for the utility of the parts.</note> through the Heart, the blood is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo continually heated, and whiles ſom blood goes through ſeldomer, other blood oftner, there is found in the Veins blood of all Qualities: which while it is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into all parts, and Nature unlocks, and offers all the treaſure to them, they may be the better heated, and receive that Nouriſhment, which may be moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to feed and ſtrengthen them.</p>
               <p>But this motion does alſo contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute<note place="margin">And that it may be preſerved.</note> much to the preſervation of the blood in its integrity, free from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or putrefaction: for</p>

               </q>
               <p>which is alſo moſt true of the blood, as we may daily ſee when the Veſſels are obſtructed.</p>
               <p>It contributes alſo to the perfection<note place="margin">And to perfect the Blood.</note> of the Blood, whileſt by continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is rarified and attenuated. But it makes chiefly towards it perfection, in that the blood is ſomtimes attenuated, grows hot, and is rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in the Heart, and ſomtimes again it is condenſed and congeales as it were in the Habit of the Body. For no part in the Body is horter then the Heart, and none leſs hot then the Habit of the Body. And therefore there happens a certain Circulation as it were, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to that whereby the Chymiſts make their Spirits moſt ſubtile and perfect. For the blood which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated by heat, after it is condenſed by cold, is able to perſiſt in that thinneſs, nor does it return to its old thickneſs: from which degree of thinneſs in tract of time it attains to a greater by means of heat, in which being again condenſed by cold, it comes to continue; and ſo at laſt it becomes moſt fit for the making of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits.</p>
               <p>For this end the blood is moved<note place="margin">The blood which is carried to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the part, is not moved circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</note> circularly; but hath it not therefore elſewhere another motion? Out of the ſmalleſt Arteries the blood is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried right out into the fleſh, that it may conſtitute the nameleſs humor, the <hi>Ros, Gluten,</hi> and <hi>Cambium,</hi> nor does it return hither from whence it came, leaſt the blood flowing through the leaſt, ſhould hinder theſe humors from being gleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and aſſimilated to the parts.</p>
               <p>It flows alſo ſomtimes chiefly, becauſe it is driven out of the Arteries into the fleſh: and frequently alſo the chief moving cauſe is attraction: for the bones cannot without attraction receive the thicker part of the humor for their nouriſhment, and leave the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thinner part thereof, unfit to nouriſh them in the Veſſels.</p>

Which they are therefore moved to think, that they may be able to give a mechanick cauſe, why the Valves of the Heart in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Arteries, do fall down and are cloſed up. I truly have alwaies eſteem <hi>that</hi> a rare deſign of <hi>Eraſiſtratus,</hi> to explain all things that happen in our Body mechanically, but I account it a raſh thing in him to meaſure the Wiſdom of God by his own Wiſdom. And theſe are to be counted Engins, which evident reaſon, and eſpecially Senſe do ſhew to be ſuch. Here contrariwiſe our Senſes obſerve, that the blood goes through the Arteries from the Heart not to the Heart; and in a rare and languiſhing Pulſe, that the Artery does not ſwell laſt, where it is knit to the Heart, as it ſhould do if that Opinion were true, but firſt of all. Alſo that the Valves are not ſhut by the blood running back, we have this ſign, that in caſe the Artery be bound two fingers from the Heart, and it be ſo opened betwixt the Ligature and the Valves, that the blood may freely paſs forth, and therefore go neither backwards nor forwards; yet the Valves may be divers times well ſaſtned, the Heart ordinarily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſo as not to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore if I would here allow of any mechanical Motion, I ſhould admit the common Opinion, which ſaies, that the ſhutting, as of the heart, ſo of the Valves, is performed by contraction of the Fibres. For that ſame contraction of the fibres in the Heart, is every where obvious to the Eye-ſight.</p>
               <p>But we have truly no ſign or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In Joy, truly, the Humors move outwards; but this may be betide by the Arteries alone. And in Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Humors may be moved inwardly through the Veins alone: and they muſt needs do ſo, for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pulſe does not ceaſe in Sadneſs, and by the Pulſe there goes continually ſomwhat through the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries outwards, hardly can any thing be moved through the Arteries inwards, and to the Heart.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, praeternaturally the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors have another motion beſides<note place="margin">Yet there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther praeterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural motion thereof.</note> that which we have here deſcribed, whileſt by their lightneſs or other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivity, they mount upwards, or by their weight deſcend downwards, as is manifeſt in ſuch as have the <hi>Varices</hi> ſo called. Alſo that way being ſhut up, by which they were wont to be moved, they are compelled to ſeek another. So in a Duck I have divers times ſeen in the Veſſels of the Breaſt, the blood parti-coloured, ſome whiteiſh, ſome reddiſh, which the Artery being contracted, was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to and from the Heart, in divers ſides of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:41352:132"/>
but that motion laſted not long, nor did the blood ever enter into the Heart by that motion.</p>
               <p>And thus (moſt worthy Friend <hi>Bartholine</hi>) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive I have anſwered your Queſtion touching the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood. Whereinto I did enquire more ſcrupulouſly, that I might better know the Nature of the Humors, and their Deflux: from which Flux of Humors innumerable Diſeaſes ariſe. I did alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that I might more exactly underſtand how good or bad blood was generated, if I knew thoſe Parts by which the Humor paſſing along might be changed. Alſo I conceived that I ſhould be better able to judg, how very many Diſeaſes ought to be cured, if I knew which Vein being opened, would evacuate ſuch and ſuch parts, and through what parts the Remedy ought to paſs, before it can come to the part affected? Alſo innumerable things came into my mind, diffuſed through our whole Art, as the Doctrine of Pulſes, of Feavers, of Inflammations, their Generation and Cure, and other things, which made me deſire to be acquainted with this Motion of Blood.</p>
               <p>And the Experiments whereby I was brought into this Opinion, are ſo evident, that I doubt not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that learned and diſcreer Phyſitians will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwards, allow of this Motion of the Chyle and Blood. Howbeit in ſome Cauſes and in certain cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of this Motion, I cannot promiſe the like Agreement: for ſundry men are Naturally inclined by a diſparity of their Judgments, to embrace different Opinions.</p>
               <p>Touching the truth of theſe Experiments, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (my <hi>Bartholine</hi>) make Queſtion, who have your ſelf ſeen many of them: and there were frequently preſent moſt learned Doctors of Phyſick not unknown to you, <hi>Franciſcus Sylvius, Johannes Van Horn, Ahaſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Schmitnerus</hi> moſt accurate Diſſecters; and thoſe perſons of ſolid Learning <hi>Franciſcus vander Schagen,</hi> and <hi>Antonius Vockeſtaert:</hi> nor were they only preſent, but they alſo afforded their Counſels and Handiwork to help make the ſaid Experiments: to whom in that reſpect I am very much obliged.

               <head>THE SECOND LETTER OF THE Motion of the Blood, To the ſaid BARTHOLINUS.</head>
               <p>SUch is the Fate of Writers, that they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compelled to write when they are unwilling: that ſo they may anſwer their Adverſaries, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they would rather be wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or the cauſe which they defend. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain learned Man would needs extort this from me, being buſied about far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">The occaſion of this ſecond Letter.</note> matters. For thoſe Theſes which he had before objected againſt, he hath endeavored now lately by a peculiar Writing to refute. In which Writing there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny witty and learned Paſſages: but I find that fault in the Author, which the Ancients found in <hi>Albutius</hi> the Rhetoritian, who made it his Buſineſs in every Cauſe he pleaded, not to ſay all that ſhould be ſaid, but all that he was able to ſay. Alſo that Motion of the Blood which is evident in live Diſſections, he hath never la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored to obſerve: juſt as if the matter might better be conceived by the Mind, then he could ſee it with his Eyes. But theſe and other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe Theſes, I leave to the<note place="margin">Anſwer to the Objections.</note> Care of <hi>Roger Drak</hi> who is now a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of Phyſick at <hi>London,</hi> a Man of an acute Wit and ſolid Learning: I ſhall<note place="margin">That in Blood letting the Vein does ſweſt at the binding.</note> only meddle with ſuch things as ſhall ſeem to oppoſe the circular Motion of Blood. And in the firſt place, what it is that Blood-letting does teach us in this Caſe, concerning which that<note place="margin">Not through Pain.</note> learned Man hath obſerved things worthy of Conſideration.</p>
               <p>A Surgeon being to open a Vein,<note place="margin">Not by ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Vein;</note> makes a Ligature upon the Arm, that the Vein may ſwell. The Vein <hi>that</hi> ſwells, not on this fide the Ligature towards the heart, but on that ſide the Ligature, which is furtheſt from the Heart. Now the Cauſe of that Tumor is not Pain, cauſed by binding the part: for oftentimes little, and commonly no pain in the part bound. And when the Arm is pinced or pained by Burning or otherwiſe, it hath its Veins for the moſt part leſs ſwollen, then upon a ſimple and bare Ligature.</p>
               <p>Nor is it more likely, that the Veins ſwell upon the Ligature, becauſe through the Veins which are ſtraiter becauſe they are bound, greater pienty of Blood comes and with more ſwiftneſs from the Liver; as about Bridges and in other places, Rivers being ſtraitned do run more ſwiftly. For the Water of a River being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:41352:132"/>
together in a narrow place, is manifeſtly lifted up into a ſwelling, from which when it falls, it goes the faſter: but the arm being bound the contrary happens; for they are not the Veins nigheſt the Liver, from which blood ſhould come, but thoſe fartheſt from the Liver which are moſt diſtended.</p>
               <p>It remains therefore, that the Veins ſwell beyond the Ligature, becauſe<note place="margin">But becauſe the motion of the Blood is ſtopped.</note> the motion of the blood running from the ſmall veins into the Heart, is ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the Ligature, and being there gathered together, diſtends the Vein. But to the end I might be more certain hereof, I bound the jugular and crural branch, in living Creatures very ſtrongly with a threed, ſo that no blood might paſs by; and I opened that part of the Vein which was more remote from the Heart, it bled plentifully, ſwiftly, vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſoon after I looſed the band, and cut the Vein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder through the middle, and the part thereof far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from the Heart being drawn out of the body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, preſently and ſwiftly fell a bleeding: whilſt in the mean time the part of the Vein neareſt the heart, being ſomewhat elevated, leaſt the Creature ſtrugling with pain ſhould eaſily force out the Blood; firſt it voided but little, and afterwards no blood at all. whence it ſeemed to me apparent, that the blood came out of the veins far from the heart, into thoſe near the ſame, and not out of the greater Veins into the leſſer; unleſs haply ſome neighbouring blood finding a way might ſlip away. Any one may eaſily try as much in opening a vein in the Arm: for if he force the blood above the Ligature upwards with his finger, ſo that the vein appear empty, yet ſhall he ſee the blood iſſue out as faſt as ever below the Ligature; which could not come through the upper branch being at preſent emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>But if the Vein be thus diſtended with blood, which is moved from the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler<note place="margin">Nor doe the Arteries ſwel becauſe of the Ligature.</note> veins to the Heart, how can the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be diſtended upon the ligature, which divers excellent Phyſitians relate to have been ſo diſtended, that it has been open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtead of a vein; the truth is, the Artery doth not ſwell upon the Ligatures being made, unleſs where it is neer the Heart, but farther off it falls in ſomewhat, and is diminiſhed, as I have an hundred times and oftener experimented in the Diſſections of living Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomies. But I do not think it was any of the authors, meaning thar the remoter part of the Artery was diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by means of the Ligature, but that their meaning only was, where the Vein did not appear which was to be opened, that there the place where it lay was to be ſought by feeling; and that by a pit, by motion and ſwelling of the Blood it was to be found: and when we feel a ſwelling, or otherwiſe diſcover the ſame, we ſhould not preſently conclude that there was the Vein; for it might be an Artery which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the hard binding had loſt its pulſe, and which by reaſon of the thickneſs of the Coates not quite fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in, might counterfeit a certain tumor and puffing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up as it were.</p>
               <p>But moreover if the Vein ſwels by reaſon of the Blood returning to the<note place="margin">But the Veins ſwel alſo with two Ligatures, and wherefore.</note> Heart, why does the vein alſo ſwel and if opened, why void Blood, when there is a Ligature made below as well as above the place phlebotomized? which Blood cannot be thought poſſibly to come from the lower parts, by reaſon of the Ligature made below the Orifice. But this does not alwayes ſo happen, but but ſometimes, only when the Arm is tied at a certain diſtance, and then the greater Veins in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two Ligatures do receive that blood from the ſmaller Veins, which ſmaller Veins receive from the ſmaller Arteries, which are joyned to the ſmal veins by way of Anaſtomoſis. And that indeed the blood which flows out betwixt the two Ligatures, does come by way of Anaſtomoſis out of the Arteries, this is a ſign and in that it flows more hotter and with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and more eaſie and ſooner a Lipothymia or faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit follows the efflux hereof. And this Ligature I am wont to make uſe of, when I have ſigns that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and hot blood is in fault, and I bid the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon ſeek out thoſe Anaſtomoſes, by his Ligature: for if the Ligature be made above the Anaſtomoſis, it ſtops the motion of the blood; but beneath it does not ſtop it, but the blood leaps out hotter to the feeling of the Patient.</p>
               <p>When a Vein is opened and the<note place="margin">Why in blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind the Arm, when the blood does not run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace.</note> blood runs out, as ſoon as it begins to ſtop or come away ſparingly, or if it did ſo at firſt, we looſe the Ligature, that the blood might run out faſter. Now the Ligature ſeems not therefore to be ſlacked, to the intent the blood may come from the Liver through the Veins. For though there be little or no blood above the Ligature, yea only a pit appear in the Vein, yet will the courſe of the Blood be increaſed by looſening the Ligature, which cannot poſſibly come out of an empty Vein. But by the looſening of the band, the Blood may the better deſcend by the Arteries, and paſs out of them into the Veins; becauſe the Arteries being compreſſed by the Ligature, by looſening the ſaid Ligature become more free. Now that the Arteries are not alwayes ſufficiently at Liberty when the arm is bound, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient himſelf can witneſs, who oft perceives the pulſe of the Arterſe at the Ligature, which perception the compreſſed Arterie cauſes, when it ſmites againſt the fleſh. And the Phyſitian if he examine the matter, ſhall often find a leſs pulſe in the bound a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m then in the free. And I can teſtifie that I have divers times applyed my fingers to the Patients wriſt, when the band was to be looſed, and obſerved, that when by looſing the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature Blood came in more plentifully, the Pulſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came greater.</p>
               <p>But if that Blood which flows<note place="margin">Why much blood may be taken away.</note> out when a vein is opened, comes out of the Arteries into the veins, how can it be plentifully taken away? for all the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries pulſe equally, and therefore they ſeem to afford blood to the Veins in one and the ſame meaſure: and if ſo be thereſt of the arteries afford ſo much to their veins as the arteries of the Arms do to theirs and is drawn out, ſhall not the heart be ſoon deſtitute of all blood? There is truly no danger at all: For we have ſaid the blood comes as faſt unto the heart, as it is driven thence</p>
               <p>Yet I cannot conceive the Blood enters all veins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, although the Arteries ſeem to pulſe equally; for all Liquors flow more eaſily and ſwiftly into an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty place, in which there is nothing to drive and force them, and moreover in this caſe the Blood is more forcibly drawn by the empty Veins then by the full ones.</p>
               <p>Now more ſtore of Blood iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues<note place="margin">And more out of the Arm then out of the Hand.</note> from a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vein opened in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, then in the Hand, becauſe all that blood, which comes to the Veins through all the Anaſtomoſes of the Cubit of the Hand, muſt return through the Cubit Veins;
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:41352:133"/>
but leſs runs through the Veins of the Hand, and that only, which comes through the Anaſtomoſes of the Hand.</p>
               <p>Out of a wounded Arterie, indeed the blood preſently flowes, although<note place="margin">Why it flows out of a wounded Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie not bound.</note> it be not bound. But that happens becauſe the Blood is carryed with greater vetiemence, though the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries then through the Veins; by which vehemency, it fills the Arterie, lifts up and diſtends the Coat, and if it be opened, neceſſarily flies out.</p>
               <p>Our of a Vein opened when Blood has flowed ſufficiently, we<note place="margin">The Ligature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looſed, the blood ſtops, and ſometimes it runs, and why?</note> ſtop it by untieing the Ligature, becauſe the Blood may be carried again its old way, now it is at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and the way free. But if it ſo happen, that too much blood being gathered about the Ligature, the Veins cannot give it a free paſſage; or ſo large an orifice be made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Blood may now go right out that way, by which it went, when it was ſhut in, ſometimes the Band being looſened, the blood runs out in a full ſtream.</p>
               <p>Which our Chyrurgeons at this very day, that they may effectually ſtop, they frequently compreſs the vein with their Thumbs a little below the Orifice, and ſo they ſtop the<note place="margin">But is ſtopped by holding the finger in the Vein below the Orifice.</note> blood; leaſt if they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it above the orifice, the blood contained therein ſhould preſently curdle, and hinder the healing up of the Vein. And they that deny that the blood may thus be ſtopped, I know not wherein we ſhould credit them who would abuſe us in a thing obvious to the Senſes. And ſeeing the Blood is ſtopped by compreſſing the lower part of the Vein, it is truely manifeſt that the Blood aſcends from the lower parts.</p>
               <p>But in caſe it ſhould happen, not in Blood-letting, but by ſome other<note place="margin">Alſo when the Vein is cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the middle and wherefore,</note> miſchance, that a Vein ſhould be ſo wounded, that the Blood could not be ſtopped, the Vein is cut aſunder in the middeſt: Whereupon, the Vein being no longer ſtrerched out as before, the parts cut aſunder are drawn upwards and downwards into the fleſh, by which fleſh the mouths of the Veins are compreſſed and ſhut, and that ſo much the more eaſily becauſe the Blood can move its ſelf ſo much the more eaſily through the neighboring veins which are exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and open, the former being ſhut up, and therefore for the very ſame cauſe a ſmall Arterie being cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der athwart, neither Bleeding nor Inflammation do follow.</p>
               <p>Which things being ſo, I conceive it is evident to all Men, that ſuch things as happen in Blood-letting, do either prove the Circular motion of the Blood, or at leaſt are not againſt the ſame.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing other Things are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt us, we muſt anſwer<note place="margin">No parts receive Blood by the veins excepting the liver.</note> them alſo. And firſt whereas they prove that the Blood comes through the Veins, not out of the Arteries, but from the Liver; becauſe ſome parts re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive Blood, and have Tumors ariſing from the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of the Blood, which parts have no Arteries, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which they reckon the Pleura. But it does not follow, if the parts have not Arteries, that their veins do not receive their blood from the Arteries, but from the Liver; for as we ſaid, the blood out of the Meſenterick and Celiack Arteries does not enter the Meſenterick and Splenick Veins, through which it is carried to the Liver: even ſo other veins may receive blood from the Arteries, which they may carry into a part more remote from Arteries. Howbeit there is no part of the Body of any bulk, wherein the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts do not rightly acknowledge Arteries to be. And infinite Arteries do not as yet lie concealed from their knowledge, becauſe the ſmalleſt Arteries diſperſed through the fleſh, have only one Coat as the Veins have. Yea, and in the Liver it ſelf, there are ſo many branches of the <hi>Arteria Celiaca,</hi> as there are Branches of the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> and as many branches alſo there are of the <hi>Ductus Cholidocus,</hi> all which have bin by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts hitherto reckoned for Branches of <hi>Vena Porta.</hi> becauſe thoſe three kinds of Veſſels are in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver incloſed in a common Coat. At leaſt no man will ever deny the Arteries of the Pleura, that has once ſeen the Cheſt of a living Creature opened; for whilſt the Cheſt is diſſected, Blood is wont to leap out of the Arteries of the Pleura.</p>
               <p>Moreover they prove that Blood does not come out of the Arteries into the Veins, becauſe the Arm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo bound, that the Arteries may ſtill pulſe, the arm is not immeaſurably ſwelled below the ligature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it ought to be ſo ſwollen and diſtended, if by reaſon of the Ligature nothing can flow back into the greater Veins, and at every pulſe, the Arteries drive ſomewhat into the lower veins, at every contraction, of which Contractions there are more then three thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed every hour. Nevertheles, it may come to paſs that the Arm is not extended to ſuch a bulk when it is bound; becauſe the veins are not totally ſhut up, and the blood may by ſome creeping holes paſs under the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and go into the greater veins: as we ſee a part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſely bound to repel Humors, for divers months or years, is nevertheleſs nouriſhed by the blood which flows through; alſo it may come to paſs that ſo little Blood is forced in through the Arteries of the bound Arm, as that it cannot diſtend, or Swell the ſame under a long time, for that Blood only is forced in, the veins being ſtretched with fullneſs, which is in the Arteries from the Ligature unto the Hand; for that which is above the Ligature, can enter more eaſily into the veins, by open Anaſtomoſes. Yea it may come to paſs, when the veins being diſtended, do no longer permit the Blood to be forced into them by the Arteries, that the pulſe of the Arteries is ſtopped, or that the Blood regurgitates upwards, and enters the Veins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Ligature, through the Anaſtomoſes: the like whereto I ſaw in a Duck, as I formerly related. Unleſs one of theſe things happen, the Arm would preſently ſwel after it is bound, and a ſuffocation of the innate Heat, by the Abundance of Blood driven in would follow. For I have often bound mine own and others Armes above the Wriſt, and I alwayes ſaw the veins diſtended, and the Fleſh to ſwell ſomewhat and grow red; and oftentimes though not alwayes, the arteries abated by little and little of their pulſe, yea and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times intermitted; and afterward the red colour of the bound Arm was changed into black and blew: and therefore I preſently undid the Ligature, being fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Example. A certain Country-man being wounded in the inſide of his Arm about the Cubit, when the Village Chirurgeon could not ſtop the blood, he bound the Arm extream cloſe about the Wound, whence followed an exceeding Inflammation of the lower part of his Arm, and ſuch a ſwelling, that deep pits were ſeen in the place of his fingers joynts, and within eighteen hours, the lower part of his Arm was gangrena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Moreover they object, if the venal Blood comes out of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,<note place="margin">How and why the venal blood differs from the arterial.</note> how can the arterial Blood differ ſo much from the venal? But we muſt know that it differs leſs from the venal Blood, then moſt men imagine, who from the violence wherewith the arterial Blood leaps forth, do collect the great plenty of Spirits therein, and the great rarity or thinneſs thereof: whereas that Leaping proceeds from the Force where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Heart drives the Blood through the arteries; for an Arterie being opened below or beyond the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature, the Blood comes out only dropping. And the difference between theſe two bloods is cauſed by the greater or leſs quantity of Heat and Spirits, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Blood is more or leſs remote from the Heart the fountain of Heat. For the Blood which is near the Heart differs much from that which is far off, in the ſmalleſt arteries, which you can hardly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh from that which is in the ſmall veins. And the ſmaller veins have more thin and hot Blood, then the great ones; which any one may eaſily try in opening veins of the Arm and Foot. Yea, and if the Vein be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened with a double Ligature on each ſide the orifice, as I ſaid before, the Blood will come out hotter then with a ſingle Ligature.</p>
               <p>Now that the Blood does not go out of the ſmaller veins into the<note place="margin">How menſtrual Blood is collected about the womb.</note> greater, they endeavour to prove by womens monthly purgations, which according to their judgment, are gathered one whole month together in the Veins about the Womb; and if they are carried from the Womb unto the Head, they conceive that they do not paſs through the <hi>Vena cava</hi> and the Heart. Howbeit, the common and true opinion is, that about the time of the uſual flux, the blood begins to be moved to the Womb, from which motion of the humors, pains of the ſides and loines are wont to ariſe about that time, And I know by Experience, that about the time of the menſtrual Flux, if the Pulſe of the Heart and arteries can be made greater, the Courſes will flow the better, becauſe the Blood will through the arteries be driven more forcibly into the Womb. It may nevertheleſs fall out, that the Courſes may be collected and make an Obſtruction in the Womb, and that then the Blood may not return into the greater veins, that motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtopped: but that is beſides nature.</p>
               <p>And when the menſtrual blood is carried out of the Womb into<note place="margin">How they are carried out of the Womb in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Head.</note> the Head, the way is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, through the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> the Heart, and the aſcending branch of the <hi>Arteria Aorta,</hi> and that they do indeed paſs through the Heart, thoſe palpitations and light faintings do ſeem to argue, which are wont to attend upon the Courſes ſtopped.</p>
               <p>But ſhould we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be a dangerous<note place="margin">How it comes that the Humors paſſing through the Heart, do not cauſe great Inconveniences.</note> thing, if all the ill humors in our bodies muſt paſs into and through the Heart. But we muſt know, that our bodies are ſo framed, as that they may be moſt convenient for us when we are in Health, and not when we are ſick. Moreover the Humor which putrifies by reaſon of obſtruction and is very bad, comes not to the Heart, becauſe its way is ſtopped up. Nor is the Heart ſo weak as to be corrupted by an evil Humor, which ſtayes not long therein: for thoſe great Phyſitians <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Hollerius, Laurentius</hi> have obſerved that the Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of ſuch as have an Empyema, and other ſharp and ſtinking Humors, do critically and without any bad ſymptomes, paſs through the left ventricle of the Heart which many times makes for the good of the ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in whom that bad Humor paſſing through the Heart, is often vanquiſhed by the Vigour and Vertue hereof.</p>
               <p>The other Objections which they<note place="margin">The Objections againſt <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</hi>
                  </note> make, do only reſpect the Cauſes of this motion or certain <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> wherein men are wont more freely to diſſent, yet let us breifly conſider whether or no they have in them any weight, wherewith to burthen our Opinion.</p>
               <p>They ſay that at every contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction<note place="margin">Nothing hinders, but that half an ounce of Blood may be forced out of the Heart, at every pulſe.</note> of the Heart, the blood is not driven out by half ounces, nor by drams, nor by ſcruples, out of the Heart of a Man, for three Cauſes: firſt becauſe that blood is too ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, but I have already ſhewed that it is not ſo ſpirituous as men imagine commonly: ſecondly becauſe thoſe little Valves of the Heart, do only gape a little, and then are cloſe ſhut again, which alſo doth not agree with experience: for an Arteric being cut off from the heart, great ſtreams of Blood do iſſue from the Heart. Thirdly that the Arteries are too full then to be able to admit half an ounce, a dram, or a ſcruple of Blood. But that is too inconſiderately avouched; for when the Heart contracts it ſelf, all the arteries in the body are enlarged, and that on all ſides, as I have divers times perceived with my hand, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the naked arterie betwixt my fingers. And who will now ſay, that all the Arteries of the Body being dilated, cannot admit of a Scruple, a Dram, yea half an Ounce of blood, more then they have?</p>
               <p>Alſo they deny that in the child<note place="margin">Nothing hinders but that the Blood may be circularly moved in the child in the Womb.</note> in the Womb, the blood out of the Vena Cava, does through the Veſſels of the heart united enter into the <hi>Arteria Aorta,</hi> and go from thence out of the umbilical Arteries into the umbilical Vein, and return back by it into the Heart: becauſe they think this great abſurdity will follow, that one Vein ſhould carry the mothers blood and withal ſo much blood as the two umbilical arteries do bring in. As if Rivers did not frequently carry as much water in one Channel, as many Brooks are able to bring in. And here the umbilical Vein when it is but one, is much greater then the Arterie. There is often but one arterie or there are two veins; that the arteries may as much as may be anſwer to the veins. <hi>In brute Beaſts</hi> (<hi>ſayes</hi> Fallopius <hi>a rare Anatomiſt</hi>) <hi>there are allwayes two Veins and two Arteries, which with the Vra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus or piſ-pipe do reach as far as the Navil, and the Veins do preſently grow into one before they enter into the Abdomen which does reach to the Gates of the Liver, as I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all Sheep, Goats, and Cows, whoſe young ones I have diſſected, But if they ſpeak of the Child in a Womans Womb, I avouch that ſometimes I have not ſeen the two um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical Arteries, but only one Arterie and one Vein aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together with the Vrachus to the Navil: where the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is again divided into two, which afterwards go unto the ſides of Os ſacrnm.</hi> And that indeed thoſe Veſſels of the Heart are united in a Child in the Womb, that the blood may paſs that way out of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfowl,<note place="margin">A ſign that it is ſo indeed.</note> as the Duck, Gooſe, and ſuch like do ſeem to teach us;

               <p>Alſo they deny the frequent Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomoſes<note place="margin">Though there be Anaſtomoſes of the Veins &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors may ariſe.</note> of the Veins and Arteries, for if ſuch there were, they ſay tumors would not ariſe by Fluxion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of Humors. As if Rivers though they have outlets, receiving over-great plenty of water, may not overflow the neighbouring fields; nor can the blood ſhed out of the Veſſels, becauſe it congeals, eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into them again. Moreover Tumors are many times cauſed, for as much as by reaſon of Obſtruction, the bloods paſſage is ſtopped; and becauſe by heat and pain it is drawn into the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe Tumors ſeem rather to favour the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the bloods circular motion, becauſe they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen through cold, bruiſing, and all ſtoppage of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Body; and becauſe with <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> or ſome ſuch medicine, the Humors and the Tumors being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made fluid, it is by this motion of the blood drawn into the Veins; and the Tumor by that means ſooner cured then by repulſion, revulſion, concoction or diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>Cauſe of the Bloods mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> difficulties do alſo preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<note place="margin">Not by Rarifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> unto us; and when we deny that the blood according to the Courſe of Nature, is ſo ſuddenly and vehemently rarified in the Heart, as to be able to move the Heart, the blood of the whole Body, and the Arteries themſelves; thoſe famous men the Ring-leaders of this opinion, do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they do hereby prove it, <hi>In that while we are cold, all the Veins of our Body are contracted, and can hardly be ſeen, where as afterwards when we grow hot, they do ſo ſwell, that the blood contained in them, ſeems to take up ten times ſo much ſpace as before it did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for me, this truly is my Opinion, and thus I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, that ſeeing they have now divers times, ſo diligently endeavored in Publick to perſwade men to embrace this their Opinion of Rarifaction; and have diffected and lookt into the Hearts of Living Creatures, nor have yet dared to ſay, that they could ſenſibly perceive any ſuch Rarifaction of the blood in the Heart; I ſay, my Opinion is, that they could not indeed and in truth obſerve any ſuch Rarifaction of the blood in the Heart, and as they would in this place maintain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it will be eaſie for him that is a little verſt in live Diſſections, to ſee that there is no ſuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifaction. And therefore though it might be proved, that ſuch a Rarifaction of the blood, does ſometimes happen praeternaturally, yet ought not the cauſe of the Natural motion of the Heart, Blood and Arteries be therefore attributed thereunto.</p>
               <p>Yet in the Example which they propound, I do not ſee what certainty there is that the blood by reaſon of its Rarifaction does poſſeſs ten times more ſpace then before. For might not that ſame Tumor of the external Veins eaſily ariſe, becauſe whereas before the veins were contracted and ſtraitned through cold, they could not receive much blood, and therefore they could not ſwell: Which cold and ſtraitning of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels being afterwards taken away, and the Veins being looſned by heat, they might admit much blood, which is driven into them by the heart, and ſo appear full and ſwelling. That this is not the leaſt cauſe of the tumor of the Veins, perſons that are feaueriſh ſeem to teach us, who if they thruſt their arms into the cold, have not their Veins ſo ſwelling, but if they keep them warm under the cloaths, they have them very full and ſwole, which tumor if it came from Rarifaction, it ought to be in both caſes alike, ſeeing that in them, the bloods Rarifaction proceeds from an internal cauſe.</p>
               <p>Nor do I conceive that it is alſo void of Queſtion and undoubted, that when we are firſt cold, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards grow hot, the inner Veins as well as the outer do ſwell. For it is much to be ſuſpected, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner parts do poſſeſs leſs blood and heat before; becauſe by that cold wherewith before they were not hurt, if when we are ſo heated we drink cold drink, they are wonderfully weakened. Doubtleſs as the inner veins are oftentimes the treaſury of the blood, wherein the blood is ſtored up for future uſes, ſo may the external<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Veins be the like treaſury, and they appear to be when they ſo ſwell as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Theſe men themſelves when they<note place="margin">But by conſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the heart the blood is driven in the Arteries.</note> obſerved that this alſo was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Opinion, that we aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the blood was manifeſtly poured out, at the conſtriction of the Heart; they avouch that <hi>that</hi> is not the conſtriction, but the dilatation of the heart which we mean. But that we were deluded by a certain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, becauſe in our conſtriction, there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction only at the Baſis, but about the tip a true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation; which Invention when others ſaw that it could not hold, leaſt they alſo ſhould ſeem to deſert their cauſe, they invented that there is a conſtriction indeed, in the Cavity of the whole Ventricle, but in the pits and paſſages of the ſides, eſpecially in Dogs, there is a certain kind of Extenſion and true Dilatation.</p>
               <p>But truly, the upper part of the Heart is not ſeen to be dilated, when the lower is contracted; ſave when the Creature is dying, and that the waving motion of the Heart is cauſed by the impulſe of the blood. Nor can we obſerve one Dilatation or Conſtriction of the Pits, another of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Only a certain progreſſive motion is obſerved in a large Heart, becauſe the Dilatation or conſtriction doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently begin at the baſis, and ſenſibly proceeds to the tip, although 'tis performed all welnear in a moment. And that I might be perfectly aſſured, that the Heart was contracted within likewiſe, on all ſides, having cut off the tip of each Ventricle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Conſtriction abating, that the ſides of the heart above, beneath and in the middle were looſned, and the pits did feel evidently larger. But in the Septum or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition wall it ſelf, no motion is felt, ſave that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſeeking egreſs make a kind of Palpitation, when in Creatures at the laſt gaſpe, the motion of the right Ventricle ceaſes, the Septum follows the motion of the right Ventricle.</p>
               <p>Now they would have it neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs<note place="margin">Not in the dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, though ſometimes blood go out therein.</note> that naturally the blood is poured out in the widening of the heart, and not in the Conſtriction or ſtraitning thereof, becauſe in the wounded Heart of Living Creatures, the blood is ſeen to come out when the Heart is dilated. And this is ſometimes true; but that which they thence collect, our very Senſes teach us to be untrue. For either the Dog or other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is placed with its Head and breaſt elevated, and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:41352:134"/>
the belly low, and ſo the wound is inflicted into the Heart, in which caſe, ſeeing the blood which enters through the <hi>Vena cava</hi> and <hi>Arteria venoſa</hi> into the Heart, is higher then any wound of the Heart, it, as ſoon as it is entred, which is at the beginning of the Dilatation, flows out, not becauſe of the Pulſe, but of its own heavineſs, and therefore it is not by any force made to flie out to ſome diſtance, as it happens in the Pulſe of the Arteries. But if as it ought to be, the dog be laid on his back, his head and belly reſting on the ſame plane, and the wounded Heart be raiſed with a mans fingers, as long as there is any ſtrength in the Heart, it ſooner by Conſtriction caſts out the blood it hath received, at a diſtance, then the whole Heart is filled or widened. But when the ſtrength of the heart decayes, and that it ſeldom ſtraitens it ſelf or not at all, becauſe the Earlets are more ſtrong, and do ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue pulſing, even when the Heart quite gives over; the blood being driven by the Earlets enters the heart, is there collected, and when more is come in then the Heart can contain, it goe out at the wound, not with violence, as it muſt do to cauſe Pulſation, but with a gentle motion, drop after drop. So that our Senſe can perceive no ſtrong motion of the blood, ſave in the Hearts Conſtriction.</p>
               <p>Now they will have the blood to return through the Veins into the<note place="margin">And being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by all parts of the Veins, it returns to the Heart.</note> Heart, only becauſe the blood being forcibly driven to the Parts, as water poured into an horn, does regurgitate or abound back upwards, and ſo is carried back unto the Heart. But I have already ſhewed tokens, that the blood is either drawn, or driven by all the parts of the Veins: beſides which I have alſo theſe following: in that the Heart being taken out of the body, the motion of the blood, and that ſwift enough, is ſtill ſeen in the Veins. And if a Vein, yea a milkie one, be tied in two places, that ſame Ligature being only looſned, which is neareſt the Heart, while the parts are yet hot, the Chvle will ſtill be moved to the Liver, the blood unto the Heart, which could neither by any ſtep be driven from the Heart through the Arteries, nor from the Guts through the <hi>Venae lacteae;</hi> nor would it by its own fluidity more rather upwards then downwards.</p>
               <p>But let us anſwer the remaining ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections:<note place="margin">By this motion the Veins and Arteries may be nouriſhed.</note> They ſuppoſe, if the blood ſhould be moved ſo ſwiftly, that the Veins and Arteries could not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently be nouriſhed.

               <p>Alſo they conceit this Motion is not uſeful for the blood. Seeing it may<note place="margin">And the blood ventilitated better.</note> ſufficiently be conſerved (ſince it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with native heat) by reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and tranſpiration.

So the water of a lake or ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding pool, though it be gently moved and fanned on the Surface, yet is it corrupted; when in the mean while Rivers that are totally and in all parts agitated, are found to continue moſt uncorrupt and wholſom.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the things (moſt excellent <hi>Bartholine</hi>) which I thought fit to joyn to the former, that I might ſatisfie thoſe who cannot receive a new opinion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they obſerve any difficulty or obſcurity; who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times have neither mind nor time to enquire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly into the bowels thereof. But in my Judgment, we ought not to deny things manifeſt, although we cannot reſolve ſuch as are difficult.</p>
               <p>But I never was diſpoſed to contend and quarrel with any man about words. There are very many excellent things about which time may be ſpent; which many times alſo is not ſufficient for our neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſions. Alſo from a Scoffer that ſeeks after her, Knowledge does hide her ſelf away, but to him that is ſtudious of the truth, ſhe comes to meet, and preſents her ſelf to his view.
