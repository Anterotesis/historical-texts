         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hath for these last precedent foure and fortie yeares,
beene ruled by a godly religious maiden Queene,
renownde <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memorie, vnto the
glorie of whose vertuous gouernment,<note place="margin">Reuel. cap. 12.</note> may with a
Christian consideration be ascribed the long-agoe
prophetical wonder seene in heauen: Of a woman
cloathed with the Sunne, in whome the Church
was figured, compassed about with the illustrate
and shining beames of the Gospell of Iesus Christ.
And vnderneath her feet the wauering and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Moone was put. For by her meanes from forth
the Church was cast the vaine inconstant mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of Romes inuented straunge traditions. And
vppon her head a crowne of twelue starres stoode,
which did foreshew, as was by her made manifest,
that from the doctrine of the twelue Apostles

al their hellish tyrannising rage, diuine <hi>Eliza</hi> during

nurse vnto the children of the Church of God, and
in the continuance of her now out dated, and yet
datelesse time: her subiects being fed with the Nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
and Ambrosia of a heauenly diet, by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of that euer-enduring truth contained in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall

razed to the earth, and the worlde shall wonder at
his destructions, ouerthrow (sure I am) this truth
must come to passe before the second comming of
the king Christ Iesus, since whose being vpon the

that was of so absolute a power, to bring to passe, the

vndoubtedly, my soueraigne Lord, this rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
age is leaning to the latter ende of time, and all
the signes forerunniug the day of iudgement, haue
put themselues into a perfect view, the reuolution

hath almost brought his course vnto a whole vnited

as it were by miracle been vntil this time preserued,
and now being created Gods great Lieutenant vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

shall be the guard vnto the Church of God, &amp;
bring confusion vpon all her enemies. For as from
the roote of righteous Iesse did proceede the liniall
race whence Christ himselfe descended: so vnto me
it seemeth that heauens eternall King in his secrete
wisdome, knowing the worlde is measured with a
little length, hath raysde you vppe (most mightie

a glorious ranke of godly and religious Kinges,

haue the Papists thinke, I speake by gesse, but want
authority whereon to ground my selfe, I haue to
that end set downe some of the dangerous decrees
made by the lawes of their misbeleeuing church,
<pb facs="tcp:15650:9"/>
for the Pope to establish his diuelish authority hath
thus decreed.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Dist 40, etsi papa, 9. q. 6. ea cuncta.</note> that no man may iudge the Pope, nor giue
sentence about his iudgement, for he is to iudge al
men vpon earth.</p>
            <p>2 That the seat of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">30 q. 1 Cap.</note> giueth strength &amp; might
vnto all lawes, but it is subiect to none.</p>
            <p>3 That hee hath authority to breake all oathes,<note place="margin">In 6. lib. 2. de sen.</note>
bondes, and obligations made betwixt any man of
high or low degree.</p>
            <p>4 That he hath power to interprete,<note place="margin">26. q. cap. Quouenc.</note> declare and
lay forth the holy scriptures, according to his own
will, and to suffer no man to expound it contrary to
his owne pleasure.</p>
            <p>5 That he is a God vpon earth,<note place="margin">In. 6. lib. de sent. Apostela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in verb continetur.</note> ouer all heauenly,
earthly, ghostly and worldly, and no man may say
vnto him, what doest thou.</p>
            <p>6 That he hath authority to dissolue subiectes
from their obedience to their Lordes and Princes,<note place="margin">In 6. lib. 2. de sen.</note>
and that he hath power to depose kings.<note place="margin">King Herold exiled Robert Archbishop of Canter. Ro. gat him to Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            </p>
            <p>7 That he may giue cleane remission vnto whom
he will, both <hi>a pena, &amp; a culpa,</hi> &amp; he whom he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth
must needs be the child of saluation: for he
hath absolute power to bind &amp; to loose vpon earth,
and saith he, the holy Church hath so determined
and the force thereof (as faith his lying blasphemy)
is greater then the canonicall scriptures.</p>
            <p>From the authority of these lawes doth this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
proceed, that so soone as any Prince displeafeth
<hi>Rome,</hi> he is presently by the pope cursed, exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated

of sins sent to all those that wil inuade, spoile,
or conquer the land of any kingdom or Prince, with
whom the Pope shall be displeased, And the beter to
effect these his often performed deeds of charitie, he
sendeth his leaden Bulles, vnto whome hee listeth,
thereby giuing authoritie vnto subiects, to resist
their kings; and lustely to take vp armes against
them, when by the Pope they shall be commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Their oathes for their allegiance are dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

be diuers misnamed holy, but vnhallowed Masses,
sung by a company of blacke, white, gray, and pibal

of the Sea of Rome be accepted, as if they were
spoken by the godly mouth of <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe. And
the more to approue his presumptuious blasphemy,
the Pope hath prouided that himselfe may be avil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,
both to God and men; and yet himselfe not to

is exalted vnto so great a dignity, in whome though

in the place before recited, thus decreed, that
though the Pope sinne neuer so grieuously, and
draw with him to hell, by his example, thousandes
innumerable: yet let no man be so hardy to rebuke
him: For he is head ouer al, and none ouer him. And
by this vsurped authoritie, is that 7. headed beast,

vpon that blessed hope, which built it selfe vpon

your name on earth, and made you greater
then euer yet was any Christian king, and hath in

Christian constancie, and religious care, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the strength thereof, by the inuisible force of
a prudent, wise &amp; godly gouernment, which doth
vnto two speciall poynts direct it selfe,<note place="margin">The well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine things is chiefely to be respected in a kingdomes gouernment.</note> which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

wherein the obedience vnto God belonging, doth
challenge to it selfe a title Capital, the celestiall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
whereof, is first before all other things in the
chiefest place to be preferred.</p>
            <p>Diuine regiment doeth therefore take vnto it
selfe the matter of Religion onely, and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces
to be vsed in the church; which in the time of
the Law, were commanded by God himselfe vnto
his seruant <hi>Moses,</hi> and hee by the appointment of
God, committed the principall charge thereof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Aaron,</hi> and his sonnes, and the tribe of <hi>Leui:</hi> but
now in the time of the Gospell, they were taught
and commaunded by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> himselfe, and by
him left vnto his <hi>Apostles:</hi> and from them the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
charge thereof is committed vnto the <hi>Bishops</hi>
and <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Church.</p>
            <p>And as in the time of the Law,<note place="margin">Aaronthough he were the high Priest vn to God, yet was he subiect vnto Moses vnto whom was reserued the supremacy of kingly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou: for he was vnto Aaron in the stead of God. Exod. 4. ver. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Aaron</hi> though
he were the <hi>high priest</hi> vnto God, and had chiefe
authoritie in diuine things, yet was not he the king,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15650:15"/>
Prince, or supreme Magistrate ouer the people of
God, but that supremacie of kingly honour, was
giuen vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> who was vnto <hi>Aaron</hi> in the stead
of God, and therefore next vnder God. <hi>Aaron</hi> and
his sonnes were accounted subiects vnto <hi>Moses.</hi>
So in the time of the Gospell, though <hi>Bishops</hi> and
<hi>Pastors</hi> haue the chiefe authoritie to deale with the
administration of diuine and holy things, yet they,
nor any of them are the kings, princes, or supreme
Magistrates ouer the people of God, and Church of
<hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> But that supremacie of kingly honour is
giuen vnto Kings, and Princes in their seuarall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
who are vnto <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors,</hi> in the stead
of God. And therefore all <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors,</hi> are to
be accounted subiects vnto their seuerall Kings and
Princes.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Moses</hi> in the diuine ordinances concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the law of God,<note place="margin">Kings &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in cause diuine, should not command vnto their sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iects thinges contrary vnto the word of God.</note> did commaund nothing vnto
<hi>Aaron,</hi> and the tribe of <hi>Leui;</hi> but that he had expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receyued from the mouth of God. So Kings and
Princes in the diuine ordinance of the Gospel of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> are not to commaund vnto their <hi>Bishops</hi>
and <hi>Pastors,</hi> any other thing then can bee expressely
warranted by the doctrine of <hi>Christ himselfe, or his
Apostles:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in the time of the Law; the Kings and

bring on them and their posterity,<note place="margin">Disobedience vnto the word of God bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth confusion vpon prince and people.</note> the eternall curse
of God, when they fled from the obedience of the
Law, written by <hi>Moses</hi> in the old testament of God.
Euen so in the time of Gospel, shall Kings &amp; Princes
<pb facs="tcp:15650:16"/>
with their <hi>Bishops</hi> &amp; <hi>Pastors</hi> bring vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themselues &amp;
their posteritie the eternall curse of God, when they
shall flie from the obedience of the Gospel written
by the Apostles and Euangelifts, and left vnto vs in
the new Testament of Iesus Christ, in which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the freedome, libertie, and iustification of our

your royall person, and your Scotlands kingdome
(from euery threatned danger) haue vntill this time
most safely beene preserued. And for from hence
must spring the firme continuance of your royall
state, and kingdomes blessednesse, your righteous
soule, no doubt, will most desire that things diuine
be chiefly lookde vnto. and because there neuer
was a church so rightly ordered,<note place="margin">Kings &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes haue authoritie to reforme those things that are amisse in the Church of God.</note> but that some errors
were therein remaining, the reformation whereof
did belong vnto the kings, vnto whose charge the
gouernment thereof in their seuerall kingdoms was
principally committed, it now therefore remaineth
euident, that your religious vnderstanding, wise,
diuine, and sanctifyed heart will in the beginning
of your most happie raigne, looke first amiddest

beautifie the Spouses of Iesus Christ. My Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne

The fearefull daunger of whose desperate estate is
principally occasioned, by the want of Pastors, able
to teach them to vnderstand that peace in whome
the lawe and the Prophets is fulfilled, and then from
the loue of those vngodly guides, which taketh vp
the place bequeathed to better men: let your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

Princes of <hi>Salomon</hi> in their Chariots, and them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing,
commaund that in their place be set the
siluer-sounding voyce of godly, reuerend, learned,
wise and preaching Ministers, who by the power of
their ministerie, may cause the true vnderstanding
of the peace of Iesus Christ, to shew it selfe vnto the
ignorant people of your land;, and that the onely

may with a sweete reflexion beautifully shine,

shining in the Church.</p>
            <p>This defect in Englands ministrie hath long
go beene seene, but not amended: and our late
godly Queene was in her time a straunger vnto this
corruption, &amp; that which in the Church did chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and honest life may go before the flocke, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

their faythes profession. For though I know good
workes can claime no merit:<note place="margin">Faith doth onely iustifie before God, but good works doth iustifie our faith before men.</note> yet as faith onely doth
iustifie vs before the God of heauen: so good works
should serue to iustifie the soundnesse of our faith

frame obiections against the puritie thereof. And
vndoubtedly (most mightie Soueraigne) in your

that the reuerend Bishops in your land, are
worthy instruments for the glorie of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
of his Church, so farre forth as they will with
a religious care striue in their places to beautifie the
Spouse of Christ, by a conscionable and religious
gouernment, to which ende they are vndoubtedly
ordained, and there authorities approued lawfull:
for the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> which commandeth that men
of their calling should not <hi>rule as Lords ouer Gods he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. ca. 5. v. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
doeth not say, neyther shall you accept of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such titles, nor indure to be called Lordes ouer
the flocke of Christ, no though the Church of
God shal in the loue and reuerence that they beare
vnto you for their masters sake, cal you their Lords,
their gouernors and teachers in diuine and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things. Surely out of the Apostle <hi>Peters</hi> words, to
me appeareth no such kinde of doctrine. For I haue
reason to resolue, that the Apostle could not teach
it to be a thing vnlawfull for himselfe, or any other
of the apostles or minister after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to receiue liuing
or honor at their handes, vnto whom they should
administer in the Lord. For the Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> in his
Epistle to the <hi>Corint.</hi> and 9. chapter, doth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
the lawfulnes thereof. And howsoeuer he did
<pb facs="tcp:15650:19"/>
forbeare to exercise his power for the good of the
Church, then being in her infant age, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it appeareth euidently, that hee left that
libertie of power to bee vsed in the Church. And
therefore, if the Bishoppes since the time of the
Apostles, haue by their lawfull libertie of power,
wherof <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, receiued as giuen vnto them
by the Church,<note place="margin">Oecumenius in. t. a. Tim. cap. 1. 2. idem in 4.</note> vnto whom they administred grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
titles, riches and honor, then <hi>T. &amp; Titus</hi> had (who
were the<note n="*" place="margin">5. Pri matii praefatio in 1. ad Tit.</note> Bishops in the primitiue Church, <hi>of which

comming of the Lord Iesus,</hi> yet notwithstanding, if the
Bishops now do execute no other office, and that in
no other sort then <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> did, then their
titles, riches and honours being but externall things
lawfully giuen, and lawfully receiued do, not preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
the worthines of their calling. And about this
the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the church of God ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.<note place="margin">That the mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers of the church should not contend about the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of bishops</note>
For it is the zealous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> godly, &amp; religious care in
the execution of their office, which doth onely dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the approbation of their calling. And if they
fail in the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of those godly duties to their
place belonging, then in the abuse of their titles, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and honors, the fault consisteth. And whereas
many in these our times do take offence against the
names, titles, wealthes, and honors, which our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
haue on them bestowed, thinking that all such
things at first proceeded from the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> they
are therin deceiued: for since the time that christian
<hi>Emperors, kings,</hi> &amp; <hi>Queens</hi> became the nursing fathers
and mothers of the Church, both titles, riches, and
honors, were by them bestowed vpon the Bishops
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15650:19"/>
in the Church who were notwithstanding obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
subiects vnto their Emperours, Kings and Queenes,
and were approued glorious ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of Christ Iesus, and all this was done before the
Bishop of Rome did make himselfe the beast of
Rome, which now he is, by vsurping vnto himselfe
the sole authoritie ouer al the kingdoms in Christen
dome:<note place="margin">The maner how and cause why the Pope refused to bee ruled by the word of God.</note> Since which time, both the Pope himselfe
and all the Bishops vnder his Antichristian sea, haue
fled from the approued authoritie of <hi>Timothie</hi> and
<hi>Titus,</hi> in not being desirous to administer vnto the
church, but like tyrannicall Lords to rule and ouer
rule the same, and by their ouerruling vtterly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow
the church, by extinguishing the purity of

made himself to be the open &amp; reuealed Antichrist,
as is before described.</p>
            <p>But now my hope is, that not any will continue
to contend about the estate of Bishops as now they
stand, sith by their lawfull liberty of power, they may
receiue dignities, on them bestowed by those vnto

therfore let not any so contend about these things as
if they thought the abuse of the Antichristian sea
could extinguish or race out the lawfull liberty of

<hi>Whose mouthes are touched with an hote coale, taken

to vnderstand the worthines of hir peace in Iesus
Christ, vpon which corner stone the truth of their
doctrine being established, it will manifest vnto the
world, that they are sent of God, and by the power
of the holy Ghost, are called to be the preaching
ministers of saluation vnto all beleeuers. Such as
these are those of whome the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration

soundly &amp; securely be preuented, so that the church
notwithstanding, the force of all occasions, shall at al

            <p>These are the faithfull sheapheards, who being
desirous not to lose a sheepe, without hauing any
chiefe respect vnto the fleece, carefully and conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
in the aboundancie of humilitie, loue &amp; zeale,
do wholy betake themselues to feede the flocke in

might not eate nor taste of any rotten or infectious
