            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="1">1. WHen the Emperour goeth to be crowned by the Pope, he, as soon as he espyeth his Holiness, is to kneel and worship him bare-headed, then to approach nearer and kiss his feet; and the same is to be done by the Empress when she is crowned: <hi>Sacrarum Ceremoniarum, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>fo.</hi> 22. <hi>edit.

When the Emperour is crowned at the publique Procession before the people, he is to go to the <hi>Pope</hi>'s House, and then to hold the Stirrup till his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness mounts on Horseback; and then like a Lacquey must he hold the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Rosinant</hi> some wayes by the reins. <hi>Ibidem, fo.</hi> 25, 26.</p>

               <p n="4">4. If there be two Kings present, then the <hi>Pope</hi> doth command the one of them on his right side, the other on his left must lead his Palfray along by the Bridle. <hi>Ibid.</hi> 17. And therefore when <hi>Frederick Barbarossa</hi> held the left Stirrup of his Holiness as he alighted from his Horse, his Holiness Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the Fourth took great displeasure, because he held the left Stirrup of his Saddle and not the right; which if he had intended to have honoured us, he would have held the right, which ought to have been holden. <hi>Funcii Chronicon.

               <p n="5">5. The best Lay-man though he be Emperour or King, must carry Water for the <hi>Pope</hi> to wash his hands in, and must carry up the first Dish of meat to his Table. <hi>Ibidem, fo.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If the <hi>Pope</hi> will not ride on Horseback, but be carried in a Chair, then four of the greatest Princes, yea though the Emperour be one of them, must put their Shoulders to the said Chair, and so carry him some space: <hi>Ibidem, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>fo.</hi> 17. By this all the Emperours, Kings and Princes of the Earth must learn to obey, fear and reverence him.</p>

               <p>IT's in the Precept of Prayer, as in that of Faith, Hope, and Charity, there is no certain time wherein this Precept obligeth directly; but only indirectly, to wit, When its necessary to acquire some good, or to remove some evil. He that prayes not to God in a temptation against chastity, sins only against chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for he sins not in omitting prayer, but because of the danger he is in to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late chastity. <hi>Tamber. decal. c.</hi> 4. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>So that we are not at any time obliged directly to pray unto God any more than to love him, believe, or trust in him; but indirectly, and as it were by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, when we have need, as in a temptation, or the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In our private prayers which we make to God, it's not necessary to use any attention; nor are we obliged to attend: for this obligation goes no further than to venial sin; and those prayers which are made by command, in that case none is obliged upon pain of mortal sin, to an inward attention in saying his Office, provided he rehearse it outwardly and entirely. <hi>Fliut.

               <p n="3">3. Whatsoever distraction or evil thoughts there are in the mind of Man in Prayer, and when he rehearses the Divine Office, though it be voluntary, if it comes of negligence and not of contempt, it's but a venial sin: when it comes from a formal and deliberate contempt, yet we fail not in satisfying the Church, and discharging our Duty. <hi>Escobar. tr.</hi> 5. <hi>exam.</hi> 6. <hi>n.</hi> 157. <hi>p.</hi> 679. For it's not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to satisfie the command of the Church, to have any inward attention; but it's sufficient to give some outward respect, and behave ones self decently. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninck</hi> 3. <hi>part q</hi> 83. <hi>art.</hi> 68. 247. <hi>n.</hi> 286. <hi>n.</hi> 301. <hi>p.</hi> 286. The outward act of prayer, which is done with the outward circumstances which it ought to have, is a true exterior action of the virtue of Religion, though it be done with voluntary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, which is it self a sin. <hi>Coninck, ibidem.</hi> For the outward adoration which is rendred to an Idol, is a true and outward act of adoration, and of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; though he who makes this adoration outwardly, hath no intention to adore the Idol. <hi>Bauny in his Sum. ch.</hi> 13. <hi>p.</hi> 176.

In receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, it's not necessary to have actual devotion; for he who is voluntarily distracted in the receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, provided he contemns it not, puts no obstacle to the effect of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, because he sins not mortally. <hi>Fillut.

If actual sin be committed in the very Communion it self, it hinders not at all from the receiving the grace of the communion; because this Sin makes not the person unworthy of the participation of the Body and Blood of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> for there is nothing but mortal sin that is capable of causing this Unworthiness. <hi>Fillut. ibidem.</hi>

               <p n="11">11.

And that unless in extream necessity, (in evident danger of death) Alms are not commanded under mortal sin. <hi>Ibid.</hi> And in that case we are not obliged any further to provide for them, if we have not Wealth to spare, and Riches which are superfluous; which very few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons believe they have, because Covetousness and Ambition make all men in a manner necessitous: so that it's clear by the doctrine of these Doctors, the Rich are not obliged to give Alms, but out of their superfluity; and not then, but in case of great necessity. Those things which may exalt us unto a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as Honour, Preferment or Places, are not to be accounted superfluous. <hi>Granad.</hi> 22. <hi>controver.</hi> 4. <hi>d.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 18.

And though we are not to give Alms, but in the greatest necessity, yet when that happens, no person is particularly obliged to provide against it; because the obligation is to assist our Neighbour in general to all those who have means to do it, but none in particular; so that a poor man may die of hunger in the view of many persons who may and ought to assist him, while they expect and attend one another, none being bound in particular to satisfie an obligation which is in common to them all.</p>

               <p>It's no mortal sin to have such a hatred against our Neighbour, as not to be willing to keep company with him, to have such and so violent an aversion from him, as upon no terms or occasion to be willing to speak with him, nor help him in his business, nor at all to forgive him, when he acknowledgeth his fault, and offers satisfaction. <hi>Bauny's Sum. p.</hi> 81.</p>
               <p n="17">17. There is no absolute Commandment to love God, because every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand carries some threatning with it to keep them in their duty to whom it is made, and then some penalty or punishment against those who violate it; now the Commandment which God gave us to love him, contains neither threat nor punishment, and so by consequence it's no Commandment truly so called. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> in his Defence of Virtue, <hi>Tr.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 28. God commanding us to love him, contents himself that we should obey him in his other Commandments: for God hath not obliged us absolutely to testifie our affections to him, otherwise than by yielding obedience to him. <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 11.

God ought to be content that we love him a little as we please, because to love him more, and to a certain degree, is only an Advice; it sufficeth that we love him much under what we could, if we would; because the least degree of love, is enough for him, and to satisfie the Commandment. <hi>Amic.

               <p>Whereas it's said we must love God above all things; we must not extend these words <hi>(All things)</hi> to the rigour in its utmost extent, and according to its natural sence, so as it comprehend under it all Creatures, but that we must understand (by <hi>all things)</hi> only those which are evil, contrary to God, and which destroy the friendship we have with him by Grace; (that is to say) mortal sin only. <hi>Amic.

               <p>And if we be obliged to love God, we are not obliged to love him above three or four moments in our life, whereof the first is when we begin to have the use of Reason; Secondly, at the point of death.

So that (according to this doctrine) who is in mortal sin, may with a safe Conscience persist voluntarily all his life in a state of enmity and aversion to God, and delay his Conversion until the point of death, demanding only forgiveness of God, when he is ready to die and can offend him no longer.</p>
               <p n="19">19. If a man being at the point of death, endeavours to do what he can, and having in his mind only an act of attrition present, he saith unto God these words, <hi>Lord have mercy on me,</hi> with design to pacifie him, he shall be justified, God himself supplying the want of absolution. <hi>Escob. tr.</hi> 7. <hi>Exam.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 122. <hi>p.</hi> 819.</p>

Faith; and though he suffers without love to God, and though he never thinks of him, it's sufficient that he be killed out of hatred to the Faith, though he have not so much as a thought of confessing it; as it happens in a suddain erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> one is killed in his sleep through hatred of Faith. <hi>Connick</hi> 3. <hi>par. q.</hi> 66. <hi>de baptis. a.</hi> 12. <hi>n.</hi> 136. <hi>p.</hi> 8. <hi>Celot. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 125.</p>
               <p n="21">21. It matters not, if death had been proposed to this man, the fear it would have brought on him, would possibly have forced him to forget God; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this conditional supposition produces no real thing in the man, it cannot hurt him. <hi>Connick</hi> 3. <hi>par. q.</hi> 66. <hi>de baptis. p.</hi> 139. So then to be a Martyr, it's not at all necessary to have so much as a conditional will to die for God, if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions were presented, that the contrary disposition, rather to forsake God than lose his life on this occasion, cannot hurt him; and by consequence it's not bad, nor hinders a man from being in a state to receive a Crown of Martyrdom, if he die without ever thinking of it in this disposition by the hand of a Tyrant.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. TO do evil, there must be an evil intention; but to do good, it's not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to have a good intention. The Commands of God and the Church may be satisfied by an outward execution of what they ordain, though it be done without intention to fulfil them, or with an evil intent; and contrary to the Commandment, and even with an express intention not to fulfil it, and on the contrary, to render a man guilty of having violated the Commands of God, and the Church, it's not sufficient to violate them, but it's required to have thereof a formed design and express intention.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ecclesiasticks satisfie the Precept of the Church in saying Prayers, when they sing or read them, though they do it without any inward intention or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; provided they observe outward modesty and decency: nay the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is satisfied, though the intention be express and formal not to satisfie it. <hi>Bauny's sum. ch.</hi> 20. <hi>p.</hi> 335. <hi>Escob. tr.</hi> 5. <hi>exam.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>n.</hi> 136. <hi>p.</hi> 677. So that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance is more necessary to Prayer, and to the actions of Religion, then the inward motions of Piety; because they can subsist without this inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not without external shew: and we may perform the duty of Prayer, though we have a formal design not to obey the Church, and to despise its Commandement.</p>
               <p>If a man fast for vain-glory, or to content his sensuality in eating and drinking Wine; and so act contrary to the intent of the Church, yet he doth not violate her Commands; for he that doth in substance, that is to say, outwardly, that which is commanded, satisfies truly the Commandement, though he hath no will to accomplish it, but rather contrary. <hi>Laym. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>tr.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 49.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a man hears a Sermon, or be present at the Divine Office of the Church, a bad intent thereunto joyned, as an intent of looking on a Woman dishonestly, is not contrary to the commandements of the Church, neither doth he therein sin, but fulfil the Precept of hearing Prayers. <hi>Fillut. mor. qq. Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>tr.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>n.</hi> 2, 12. <hi>p.</hi> 128.</p>

               <p n="5">5. No man is responsible for the evil effects which are adherent to any action, except he formerly intend and procure them; therefore though a Woman knowes that a man loves her dishonestly, she sins not, how often soever she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents her self before him, and in his view, so as she hath not an intent to stir up the dishonest love which he hath towards her. <hi>Fillut. To.</hi> 2. <hi>tr.</hi> 28. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>n.</hi> 232. because he that loves her dishonestly, doth rather take this occasion of offence

from his own malice, then she gives it him by the use of her own right and liberty.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If a man be to do an act, and makes protestation that his intention is not to do any evil; let the act be never so wicked, it's no sin in him. <hi>Bauny's sum. c.</hi> 14. <hi>p.</hi> 219. Therefore to kill an Heretick, if your intention be to propagate the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholique Faith it's no sin; and an Usurer who giveth his Money to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to make profit thereof, may deliver himself from Usury and Restitution, with protestation that it's not in his intention to make any usurious contract, but to lend it him for his good, and that he would do nothing therein against God and his Conscience. <hi>Bauny. ibidem.</hi>

If a Servant by the command of his Master goes and tells a Woman with whom he knowes his Master intends to commit Adultery, that his Master will be found at home such an hour; or if by the command of his Master he followes a Damosel to see and enquire where she lodges, if by his command he doth not only open the door, but shew her where his Master is, if he aid his Master to get up by the Window to enter the house where he is to commit the sin, the Servant by directing his intention, may free himself of any such or the like sin; by intending that he did it for some good end, as for the just reward which he expected, or for fear of the loss of his Master's favour, or some other damage: and protesting that he is not pleased with this sin of his Master. <hi>Tamb. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. c.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 30.</p>

You may desire the death of an Enemy who might do you much hurt, not of hatred to him, but to avoid the damage and hurt which he would do you; you may also rejoyce in his death, because of the good which you receive thereby. <hi>Em. Sa. verb. charitat. n.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 65. And all this may be done without sin, by that excellent Science of directing the Intention.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To lye with a Woman (by the rule of directing the Intention) whom he representeth to himself as under a condition, and as if he were married to her, is a thing which is not ill, and which on the contrary is good. <hi>Sanch. op. mor. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 34. <hi>p.</hi> 9. <hi>Fillut. mor.

               <p n="11">11. It's lawful for persons of all qualities, conditions and sexes, to go to the the Stewes or places of common prostitution, (intending to convert Women) though it be very probable (as frequently before) they will there commit sins themselves. <hi>Myst. of Jesuitism. p.</hi> 146, 147.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If any man hath done me an injury or wrong, I may pursue him, not with an intention to be revenged of him, or to render evil for evil, but out of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to preserve my honour. <hi>Reginaldus in praxi. lib.</hi> 21. <hi>n.</hi> 62. <hi>p.</hi> 260. There is no more to be done, than to divert the Intention from the desire of Revenge, which is sinful, to incline it to a desire of maintaining our honour, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable; and by this means you may acquit your self of all obligation both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and towards Man, for you satisfie the World by permitting the action, and satisfy the Gospel by purifying the intention.</p>

A man may accept of a Challenge and fight a Duel in maintenance of his honour; and come to the place appointed, not with an express intention to fight the Duel, but only with that of defending himself, if he, by whom he was challenged, comes unjustly to set upon him; for what hurt can there be for a man to go into the Field to walk there, in expectation of another, and to defend himself if any one sets upon him? it's no sin at all; for when the intention is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to other circumstances, the Challenge is not at all accepted; for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation

               </head>
               <p>IN conduct of affairs to be well instructed in the subtilities and inventions of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> are of great use; which may be referred to equivocations in words; and want of intention in Oaths and Promises: The one is a means to say what you will without lying; and the other an expedient to swear and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise all things without being obliged to perform any thing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man may make a promise without any intention to promise; but in case he had an intention to promise, but no intention to perform, then he is obliged to his promise, but not obliged to perform what he promised; the same of an oath. <hi>Sanch. op. mor. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>n.</hi> 7, 8. <hi>p.</hi> 42. <hi>Gr. Valentia.</hi> 22. <hi>d.</hi> 6. <hi>q.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A man may make a promise without any intention to promise, and so he is not obliged to perform; because he had no intention to promise: and therefore if he be asked if he made any such promise, he may with a safe conscience say, No; intending that he had not promised by any promise to oblige him; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence he may also swear; for otherwise he should be constrained to pay that which he owes not. <hi>Fillut. Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>tr.</hi> 25. <hi>n.</hi> 323. <hi>p.</hi> 161. And therefore he may safely say, That he owes not that which he hath promised, and that he lies not, in forswearing it; because, in promising and in swearing, he had no intention to promise or swear, no more than to perform what he promised.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you have made a promise or an oath, and you doubt whether you had an intent to oblige your self; it's probable you are not obliged to keep it. <hi>Tamb. decal.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 7. <hi>tit. V. n.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To feign in an important matter, and to vow only with ones lips, is but a venial sin, because it's only a lye which contains no irreverence towards God. <hi>Tamb. decal.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>sect.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If to promise without an intention to promise, and to promise without an intention to do what is promised, be not sufficient, the better to carry on designs, and to cause your projections to prosper, and to gain belief, it's lawful to add an oath.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He who desires not to swear, (the better to obtain belief) may find out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes to speak, and to affirm, which passeth commonly for oaths, but indeed are not; as for example, If I swear by God, wherefore do you not believe me? If this be not, I have no faith in God, I renounce God. This is as true as the Gospel; Before God this is so; God knows it's so; On my faith, by my faith, God be my witness; I may swear by God, by Jesus Christ; I will swear by God; though the ignorant, and those who do not look nearly to them, take these speeches for oaths, but they are not, because they assert nothing, and they are imperfect dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41125:11"/>
and have no determined sence. <hi>Escob. tr.</hi> 1. <hi>Exam.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 17. <hi>p.</hi> 72. <hi>Sanch. op. mor. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 16, 17, 19, 20. <hi>p.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When one is resolved to swear, you may choose words of double meaning, and make use of a mental restriction the better to effect your ends; and this is warrantable according to the most Learned Doctors amongst the Jesuits: for no man is obliged by virtue of his oath, beyond his intention; for an oath cannot oblige in conscience beyond the intent of him which swears; and by consequence he that hath no intention to swear, cannot be obliged to any thing at all. <hi>Sanch. op. mor. lib</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>n.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>p</hi> 49.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The art of mental restriction or reservation, is an art of great use, and must be well studied, and none can teach the Theorie or Practice of it so well as the Jesuits; they being the great Doctors of the faculty of Equivocation. This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine shall be illustrated by some few Examples; If a promise by oath to pay a certain sum of Money, be drawn from a man unjustly, or by force, he that swears in this manner, may use an equivocation in these terms; I swear to you, I will, give this mony; intending that he would give it to him, to whom he sware, or to some other; because these words may receive either of these two sences. <hi>Sanch. op. mor. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>n.</hi> 37. <hi>p.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>If a Woman be excommunicated for departing from her Husband, because she knows of some secret impediment which makes the Marriage void, being at the point of death, she is obliged, that she may receive absolution to swear, That if she recover her health, she will return to her Husband; she may promise and swear it, intending in her mind, If I be obliged thereunto, or if it shall please me at that time. <hi>Sanch. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>n.</hi> 40. <hi>p.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If in the tongue in which one express an oath, the name of God signifie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things, it will be lawful to swear by the Name of God, taking it in some other signification: According to this rule a man may safely swear by the Name of Jesus Christ, because there are others named <hi>Jesus,</hi> besides the Son of God, and that this word, <hi>Christ,</hi> is attributed to divers Persons in Scripture, and that not only Christians, but to Jews.</p>
               <p n="10">10. When one is required to make oath unto a person in a case in which he believes that he is not obliged to swear; he may do it without fear of Perjury; he may make use of the one or the other of these two expedients; First to take the words wholy he uses in swearing, and which are false in their true sence, in a quite different sence, such as he pleases, provided it be true: Secondly, to give no sence at all to his words, and to take them materially, that is to say, as sounds which signifie nothing. <hi>Sanch. op. mor. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>n.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If a person be ignorant, and cannot make right use of mental reservation, upon occasion, he may swear plainly without obliging himself in any sort what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, provided he hath no intent to swear, nor to perform that which he swears. <hi>Escobar. tr.</hi> 1. <hi>exam.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 37. <hi>p.</hi> 76.</p>
               <p n="12">12. To establish this knowledg of equivocation in the World, and to facilitate the practice of it amongst all sorts of people, the Jesuits have delivered to their disciples divers excellent rules, and examples for the perfecting of them in this marvellous art of equivocation; therefore, if you be asked, If you have eaten of such a dish; you may answer, I have not eaten of such a dish; intending in your mind, to day; though the intention of him that asked, was to know it you had ever eaten of it. <hi>Fillut. op. mor.

               <p>If one demands of a man to borrow mony, which he indeed hath, but which he will not, and which he is not obliged to lend; he may swear that he hath it not at all; meaning not to lend him, or meaning not in another place than in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41125:12"/>

Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>tr.</hi> 25. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>n.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 32.</p>
               <p>If he be interrogated by a Judge, Whether he had done such a thing? he may safely swear he hath not done it, when he hath done it; intending in his mind some other thing, which he hath not in truth done, or some other day than that on which he did it, or some other circumstance as he pleases, so it be true; he doth not lye, neither is he forsworn. <hi>Sanch. op. mor. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>n.</hi> 15. This is a rare way to justifie all manner of lies, and perjuries: The greatest Impostors may make use hereof to maintain themselves in these crimes.</p>
               <p>And it's always justifiable when necessary, or advantagious in any thing that concerns a man's Health, Honour or Estate. <hi>Zanch. op. mor. p.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>n</hi> 12. <hi>Provinc. Letter.</hi> 9. §. 129, 130. <hi>Fillutius</hi> assigns a way much more secure than the former, to avoid lying; and that is when a man having said, <hi>I swear I have not done such a thing,</hi> he adds, whispering to himself, <hi>this day. Fillut. tr.</hi> 25. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>n.</hi> 331. This is to speak truth towards himself, and lie to others. Men will be often at a loss if they have not this Science.</p>
               <p n="13">13. It's not enough to know the Rules of any Mystery, if it be not known how to reduce them to practice.</p>
               <p>Therefore there are two Rules given by the Jesuits, that men may have change, and make use sometimes of one, and sometimes of the other.</p>
               <p>The first is, to have an intention to pronounce the words materially, that is to say, as if they signified nothing; and to take from them in his mind their proper signification not desiring they should have any at all. And that this method may be made easie to understand, take this example: If a man be interrogated by a Judge if he did such a fact; he may safely swear he did it not; with this mental restriction <hi>(this day),</hi> though he did it at another day. <hi>Fillut. op. mor. Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>tr.</hi> 25. <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>n.</hi> 328. <hi>p.</hi> 204.</p>
               <p>The second rule or method is, To have an Intention to compose ones discourse, not only of words, which are audibly pronounced, but also of those which are secretly reserved in ones mind, it being free for those who speak, to express their thoughts wholly or in part. <hi>Fillut. ibidem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. It's lawful in our defence at all times to make use of equivocation, though he who doth examine us, do press us and make us swear not to use them, but to answer him without making use of equivocation: he may safely swear, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing secretly that he doth it as far as he is obliged to speak clearly, and to expound himself, or by forming some other thought, which may make him answer true. <hi>Sanch. op. mor. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>n.</hi> 45. <hi>p.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>If any one be examined by a Judge if he did such a thing; he may swear he hath not done it; intending his answer, Not in that manner as the Judge examins him maliciously, but in the manner he ought to examin him in the quality of a Judge. <hi>Sanch. ibidem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. When a Prince commands a Subject to do such a thing when he receives his orders, he promises to obey him; though he be resolved to do nothing of that he shall command him, by making use of this mental restriction, saying in himself, I will do this not as you command me, but as you ought to command me. <hi>Sanch. ibidem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. A Wife or Children being called before a Judge to declare and confess what they have put aside or taken out from, or usurped of the moveables or Goods of the deceased, are not in conscience obliged to confess, or declare the same; but because they may be brought to swear, they may make use of this expedient that they may not lie, and so doing forswear themselves, the prudent Confessor may teach them that they are to frame a conception in their mind,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41125:12"/>
according to which they may form their answer and oath, which they may make by the command of the Judge, to justifie and make him believe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. <hi>Bauny his Sum. c.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 156.</p>

               <p n="19">19. If a man lies in using equivocation without any necessity obliging him thereunto, and swears to confirm this Equivocation, he doth neither lie nor commit perjury; because he that speaks and swears in that sort, hath no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to speak or swear falsly. <hi>Fillut.

This Maxim is of admirable use to licence the Lies and Oaths which some do make use of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to deceive others, and those who forswear themselves before Judges.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Oaths, which are made without actual advertency and consideration, which of themselves are sufficient to a mortal sin, are not of themselves new sins properly, because of the custom of swearing, how great soever they be, though no retraction be made of them. <hi>Sanch. mor. par.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5, 8, 28. <hi>p.</hi> 21.</p>

It's lawful in Conscience for a man to quit his own proper opinion, though more probable to follow the probable opinion of another though less sure; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, he who believes an opinion probable, acting according to that opinion, ought not to be deemed as rash and imprudent: Upon this Principle <hi>Pilat</hi> acted when he put <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to death, quitting his proper Judgment, by which he believed him to be innocent, to follow the opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who maintained that he was worthy of death. Nay, <hi>Pilat</hi> herein, according to the Jesuits, ought to be justified, because he followed a probable Opinion, and more than probable, because it was not the opinion of one Doctor, but of all the Doctors and Priests of the <hi>Jews,</hi> That <hi>Jesus</hi> was a Malefactor and deserved death. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When one believes assuredly that an Opinion is false, and that we cannot follow it directly in the conduct of some person, we may send this person to those who hold with it, and counsel him to follow their advice. <hi>Layman. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you meet with two contrary Opinions, you may follow them both in different affairs, and even in the same affair also, acting and giving contrary counsels, now after the one, and then after the other. <hi>Layman. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A man may hold an opinion probable, when he is persuaded that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or some other can answer the reasons upon which that opinion is grounded; and it's safe in Conscience to act according to such a probable opinion. <hi>Sanch. op. mor. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When a Superior and those which are under his charge be of different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the Inferior is not bound to obey his Superior: and therefore when a Subject believes according to a probable opinion, that the Commands of his Prince are unjust, or that he exceedeth the bounds of his Jurisdiction, he may disobey him, because it's lawful for all men to follow a probable opinion. <hi>Escob. in praem.

The priviledges of Probability cannot only dispense with an Inferior for the obedience which he owes to his Superior, but may elevate him above his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, and to oblige the Superior to obey his Subject. Upon this Principle a Confessor is obliged to follow the probable opinion of his Penitent, and quit his own opinion, though more probable; because the Penitent grounding himself upon a probable opinion, hath a right unto absolution. <hi>Escob. in praem.

It's probable that an Excise is justly established by a Prince; it's probable on the other side; that it's unjust; you being at present appointed by the Prince to collect this Impost, require it according to this Opinion, which maintains that it's just, and therefore it's lawful for you to levy it without doing any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice: but if to morrow, or the same day, you being a Merchant, may secretly defraud this Impost or Excise, following the Opinion that it's unjust. <hi>Tamb. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Theol. c.</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 5. <hi>n.</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>p.</hi> 21.</p>

A man may, relying on an Opinion sweet and indulgent, but probable, disobey his Prince or Superior in a thing in which it's probable that he is not obliged to obey, but it's more probable that he is obliged to the Prince or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior following the Opinion which is more safe, judges that he ought to obey, and therefore that he hath sinned; the Prince or Superior hath reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand obedience, the Inferior hath reason not to obey, both founded upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Opinions; inthis case the Prince or Superior is rash, if he judges that the Inferior sins, because it's not probable, that he sins who follows a probable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and so it being probable, that the Inferior hath not sinned; the Prince or Superior shall be unjust, if he treats him as guilty; for where there is no fault, there is no punishment. <hi>Cat. in Com. in Reg.</hi> 6. <hi>Bernard. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 65.</p>

A lawful Prince doth publish Just Laws for his Subjects to obey, and they have no cause to complain thereof; or just reason to refuse them: the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects do sin, and it may be said they do not sin at all; for there is great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Reasons on each side to make both Opinions probable, and to give liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to which the Jesuits please; but the more safe, and more probable is to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey. <hi>Esc.

               <p>But Priests and Ecclesiastics, must be exempted from obedience to the Laws of Princes; for they are not Subjects of necessity and obligation, but only out of respect and good example towards Princes Laws, which regard the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their States, and which derogate not from the Ecclesiastic State. <hi>Escob.

               <p n="14">14. All probable Opinions are of themselves as safe the one as the other; but the more pleasant, though they be less probable, are always more profitable and more safe, because they are more easie, and by consequence more favourable to Temporal Interest. <hi>Cat. in Com. in Regal. Sancti Bernardi. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>d.</hi> 6. <hi>n.</hi> 58. <hi>Idem, Theol. fundam. p.</hi> 134.</p>
               <p n="15">15. As it's impossible that an Opinion which hath the approbation of many Learned Doctors should not be probable, so it's impossible to reject it; none of their Propositions can cease to be probable, if the contrary doth not become an Article of Faith. <hi>Layman. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>By these Maxims, following a probable Opinion, you are exempted from all sin: you may act, do, or say what you please, and you are safe. The Gospel of Christ made men sinners, but these make them all innocent. If there be two persons which do the same thing, he who knows not this doctrine, sins; and he who doth, sins not. If things and actions should be measured by the Scripture and the Fathers of the Church, they could not be done without sin; therefore it was necessary that the Jesuits should by their Prudence moderate things so, that those things which persons could not act by the Law of God without sin, they may safely do and act by these Maxims. They have discovered many new ways to Heaven, which were heretofore unknown to the Church and Jesus Christ himself, who hath not spoken any thing of them in his Gospel; if he doth, it hath been only to condemn them. Following the Principles of these good men, you will find it's not only easie to be saved, but it's almost impossible to be damned; There can be no affair of Conscience so troublesom or so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41125:14"/>
for which Expedients may not be found; nor any Crimes so black, which may not easily be excused and justified; there was never a better contrivance invented in the World, than this of probable Opinion; for there are but two Conditions required to make an Opinion probable; First, that it be founded on Reasons in some sort considerable, which will be very easie; for no man hath formed an Opinion, but doth believe that the Reasons which he brings are good enough to support what he maintains. The second condition, That there be no convincing reason for the contrary; which is no less easie than the former; for a reason may be convincing in respect of one man, which is not to another: and an obstinate man will always think his Reasons best; but in case you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not answer the reasons on the contrary, you may persuade your self some other more Learned may do it; and so it doth remain probable, and you may safely act in Conscience by and according to it, though that which you act or do be against the Divine Law, and condemned by God in Scripture. <hi>Sanch. op. mor. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 17. <hi>p.</hi> 30.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IF the right of the parties seem equal on both sides, the Judg may take mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or a present of one party, to give advantage whether he pleaseth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he may do favour, and this favour may be valued by money, and because for the most part the Judg loseth the friendship of one of the parties. <hi>Esc. tr.</hi> 3. <hi>ex.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 111. <hi>p.</hi> 363.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the opinions are so doubtful and divided, that its in the power of the Judges to follow which he pleaseth; if one of the parties make him a present to gain him to his side, the Judg doth not offend against Justice in receiving that which is given him to follow one of the two Parties rather than the other. <hi>Esco. tr.</hi> 6. <hi>Exam.</hi> 6. <hi>n.</hi> 44. <hi>p.</hi> 743.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Judge giving Judgment, may follow a probable opinion, leaving that which is more probable; nay he may judg against his own proper opinion, as did <hi>Pilat,</hi> who condemned <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> after he had declared publickly, that he believed him innocent. <hi>Escob. in proem.

               <p n="4">4. When the right of the Parties is not clear, or when it happens that there are different opinions concerning the sence of the Law; when the one opinion is as probable as the other, it's in the power of the Judge to chuse which he pleaseth, and to follow it in his judgment. <hi>Sanch. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 45. And he may, if it gives no scandal, judge one while according to one opinion, and another time according to another opinion. <hi>Ibidem.</hi> For if he may choose of two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinions, that which he pleaseth, it follows, That he may follow sometimes the one opinion, and sometimes the other, as he pleaseth; but if one of the two opinions be more probable than the other, the Judge may pronounce judgment according to that he likes best, and even to follow that which he believes to be less probable. <hi>Ibidem.</hi> And the Judge doth not herein behave himself impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently or rashly, guiding himself as he doth by a probable opinion. <hi>Ibidem.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. If a person who hath born false witness through ignorance or inadvertency, which occasions the condemnation of a man, and the loss of life or member to another; he is not obliged after that he understands the truth, to retract his false testimony, for fear of exposing himself to great evils. <hi>Tolet. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 59. <hi>Dicast. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>tr.</hi> 2. <hi>disp.</hi> 8. <hi>dub.</hi> 7. <hi>n.</hi> 92. For it's lawful to kill an innocent person, after we have slandered him, rather than to expose our selves to danger by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting; though it's not so much the offence or Hang-man, as the false witness which puts him to death:</p>

               <p n="7">7. If a man is accused of a Crime which cannot be legally proved by the Accuser; he may not only deny the crime, but say, That the Accuser lies and slanders him. <hi>Tamb. lib</hi> 9. <hi>decal. c.</hi> 2. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 2. For it's no lie to say unto a man he lies, when he knows that he speaks truth, and to slander an accuser as a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, where he accuses us of a crime which we have committed, of two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers the one speaks the truth, the other lies; the one objects a true crime, and the other a false, yet in that saith the truth is the liar; and he who objects a true crime, is a slanderer; which is admirable divinity, and may be made use of in conduct of affairs.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If a man cannot defend himself against a false and unjust Witness but by slandering of him, he may without sin impose on him so many false Crimes as will be necessary for his defence. <hi>Tamb. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>decal. c.</hi> 2. <hi>s.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7. If he doth it, he sinneth not against Justice, and by consequence he is not obliged to restitution. <hi>Ibidem.</hi> So that by this Maxim to defend our selves from true but secret crimes, and whereof there is no publick proof, we may say to the honestest man in the World, who would inform against us in a Court of Justice, That he is a Sodomite, Heretick, Excommunicate, &amp;c. And we may for proof of this Slander, make use of false witnesses, counterfeit false Deeds and Writings, and corrupt publick Notaries to subscribe them, without committing of any injustice at all, though the Scriptures do forbid it as a Sin. So that you may observe the Pious Care of these holy Fathers, in framing Maxims stable to all times, persons and things. The Gospel of Christ may be useful to some ends and designs, but being not equally serviceable to all, many times it's to be laid aside; for if you make too much use of it, it will give a check unto your actings, and obstruct your designs if you act according to its directions.</p>

               <p n="22">22. He who prayes not to God in a temptation against Chastity, Sins only against Chastity; for he Sins not omitting prayer, but because of the danger he is in to violate Chastity.</p>
               <p n="23">23. In our private Prayers which we make to God, it's not necessary to use any Devotion or Attention; nor are we obliged thereunto: and in those which are made by command, we are not obliged unto any inward intention, provided that we rehearse them outwardly, and behave our selves decently and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Whatsoever distractions or evil thoughts come into our minds when we are at prayer, if they be not on contempt, but negligence, the sin is but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Christ commands us to receive the Sacrament of Baptism, a Tyrant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us upon pain of our Lives, we must obey the Tyrant rather then Christ.</p>
               <p n="26">26. In receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, it's not necessary to have actual Devotion; for let one be distracted with evil thoughts in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament, provided he contemns it not, yet he is a worthy receiver, and only sins venially; and so if he commits any sin, in the Communion it self.</p>
               <p n="27">27. He who hath sinned mortally, and hath remorse for his sins, and hath confessed them to a Priest, may well Communicate, though a little before the Communion he hath sinned mortally.</p>
               <p n="28">28. If a man after he hath communicated many times in a bad state, cometh to be converted, he shall receive in an instant, all the graces which were due to so many Communions.</p>
               <p n="29">29. It's not necessary that the Priest who finds himself guilty of mortal sin, should Confess himself before he Administers the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="30">30. A Person who hath abundance, after he hath satisfied all his own neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries and those of his Family, having yet a superfluity, is not obliged in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Famine to give unto the poor, nor to any one whomsoever, if he see him not in eminent danger to dye with Famine.</p>
               <p n="31">31. The precept of giving Alms may be fulfilled; by lending only, without giving any thing.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Rich men are not obliged to give Alms but out of their superfluity, and not then, but in case of great necessity; those things which may exalt us to a better condition, as to Places or Preferment, are not to be accounted super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous: Therefore Alms are rarely to be given; for it seldom happens that we have goods superfluous.</p>
               <p n="33">33. There is no obligation to love our Neighbour; it's sufficient not to hate him.</p>
               <p n="34">34. There is no absolute Commandment to love God; but when in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are commanded to love God, they are but Counsels and Advices, and no Commands; for God hath not commanded so much to love him, as not to hate him; and he ought to be content that we love him, as little as we please, and it sufficeth that we love him much under that we could if we would; for the least degree of love is enough for him.</p>
               <p n="35">35. If we be obliged to love God, we are not obliged to love him above Three or Four Months in our Life; whereof the first is when we begin to have the use of Reason. 2. At the point of Death. 3. Every Fifth year during Life.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41125:16"/>
For the rest of our time we may love God or the World, as we please.</p>

               <p n="37">37. A man may be a Martyr not only without any act of Charity, but also without any act of Faith; and though he suffers without love to God, and though he never thinks of him.</p>

Those who in their Youth, have committed many actions of a vitious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which they did not believe to be such, are not obliged to confess them, when they know their nature; because when they committed them, they had not the full use of Reason; and at most they were but venial sins, if any sin at all.</p>
               <p n="41">41. The pleasure which is taken in an action of mortal sin, which is done in sleep, drunkenness, madness, or through ignorance, is no sin.</p>
               <p n="42">42. He who doth some unlawful act, knowing well that it's forbidden, but not remembring it to be such, when he doth it, is exempt from mortal sin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause forgetfulness or negligence which is the cause we think not of it, the evil we are about to do, is not imputed for sin, if it be not voluntary, if we do not consider that we are obliged to examine that we are about to do.</p>
               <p n="43">43. God cannot command or forbid a thing that is in it self slight, under the penalty of mortal sin.</p>
               <p n="44">44. He who hath knowledg in the Law, and is ignorant of the penalty which it ordains against those who violate it, doth not incur the penalty.</p>
               <p n="45">45. He who hath a will to commit all venial sins, if he were able, sins only venially.</p>

               <p n="98">98. If you have made a promise or an oath, and you doubt whether you had an intent to oblige your self, it's probable you are not obliged to keep it.</p>
               <p n="99">99. To seign in an important matter, and to vow only with one's lips with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intention, is but a venial sin; because it's only to lye, which is no great irreverence towards God.</p>
               <p n="100">100. He who desires not to swear (the better to obtain belief) may find out many wayes to speak and to affirm, which commonly passeth for oaths, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are not.</p>
               <p n="101">101. When one is resolved to swear, you may choose words of double mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and make use of a mental restriction, the better to effect your ends; no man is obliged by his oath beyond his intention, so by consequence if you have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to swear, you are not obliged.</p>
               <p n="102">102. The art of mental restriction or reservation is of great use, and must be well studied; if a promise by oath be drawn from a man unjustly by force to pay a certain Sum of Money; he that swears in this manner may use an equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in these terms, <hi>I swear to you, I will give this Money,</hi> intending to give it to him to whom he swears, or to some other; because these words may receive either of these two Sences.</p>
               <p n="103">103. If in the Tongue in which you swear, the Name of God signifies divers things, it will be lawful to swear by the Name of <hi>God,</hi> taking it in some other signification.</p>
               <p n="104">104. When one is required to make oath unto a person in a case in which he believes he is not obliged to swear; he may do it without fear of Perjury, though that he saith be false.</p>
               <p n="105">105. If a person be ignorant and cannot make use of mental reservation upon occasion; he may swear plainly without obliging himself in any sort whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; provided he hath no intent to swear, nor to perform that which he swears.</p>
               <p n="106">106. This art of Equivocation in the conduct of affairs is of marvellous use, and the Jesuits have given many Rules and Examples for the facilitating of it. If one desires to borrow money of a man, which indeed he hath, but which indeed he will not lend; he may swear he hath it not at all, meaning, not to lend him.</p>
               <p n="107">107. It's lawful in our defence at all times to make use of Equivocations, though he who examines us, do's press us, and makes us swear not to use them; yet he may safely make use of them.</p>
               <p n="108">108. One is discharged of his Oath, though in doing what he swears to do, he hath an express intent not to do or fulfill it.</p>
               <p n="109">109. It's a less sin to swear in common talk by the Holy Name of God, than it's to eat an Egg in <hi>Lent.</hi>

110. If I swear to do such an act, and have no intention to swear, though I do not perform the act, I am not forswern, because an Oath depends on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of him who swears.</p>
               <p n="111">111. If a man lyes in using Equivocations, without any necessity obliging him thereunto, and swears to confirm this Equivocation, he doth neither lie nor commit perjury; because he that speaks and swears in that sort, hath no intention to speak or swear falsly.</p>
               <p n="112">112. If one commit Perjury through natural inadvertency, or because of ill custom he hath to forswear, it's no mortal sin; because he doth forswear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self without perceiving it at all.</p>
