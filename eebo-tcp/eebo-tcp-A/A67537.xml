            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>To part from them (as many have begun)</l>
            <l>Who <hi>Edom</hi>-like have for a messe of broth</l>
            <l>Sold birthright, freedome, substance, faith and troth.</l>
            <l>Did such but know experimentally</l>
            <l>The value of the freedome they enioy;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61914:10"/>
Had they but noble spirits; they would scorn</l>
            <l>To live in slavery, that were free born.</l>
            <l>But rather chuse to die a noble death,</l>
            <l>Then to live here ignobly underneath</l>
            <l>The feet of Tiranny: For when our Laws</l>
            <l>Are chang'd: and when our liberty withdraws,</l>
            <l>Straight every upstart scoundrill will out-brave's,</l>
            <l>And <hi>English</hi> States shall live like <hi>Turkish</hi> slaves.</l>
            <l>As for the carriage of the Cavaliers,</l>
            <l>Their tyrranny and wickednesse appears</l>
            <l>So grosse, and palpable, that it will be</l>
            <l>But needlesse labour, and time lost for me</l>
            <l>Their rude and barbarous actions to repeat;</l>
            <l>Their robberies and murthers are so great</l>
            <l>In <hi>Yorkeshire, Lestershire,</hi> at <hi>Coventry:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Northamptonshire, Bath, Portsmouth, Banbury,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And superstitious <hi>Oxford,</hi> that was glad</l>
            <l>At their first entrance; but are since grown sad,</l>
            <l>To see their rude behaviour, and what preys</l>
            <l>They make of all things that fall in their wayes.</l>
            <l>And now tis scarce unknown to any Nation,</l>
            <l>That Papists have a generall dispensation</l>
            <l>From their unholy Father; and they may</l>
            <l>Now go to Church, and hear <hi>Don Bletro</hi> say</l>
            <l>His Enigmattick Legend and may hear</l>
            <l>A temporizing Sermon without fear,</l>
            <l>So they advance his work: and do their bests</l>
            <l>Through <hi>Europe</hi> to set up his Papall hests.</l>
            <l>Which now are falling down, and those that be</l>
            <l>Church Papists, as men terme them certainly</l>
            <l>Are out most dangerous enemies; and do</l>
            <l>Oppose, maligne and undermine us too.</l>
            <l>If any <hi>Ignoramus</hi> yet there be,</l>
            <l>That will not his own priviledges see,</l>
            <l>Nor will retain them: But will side with those</l>
            <l>That are both Gods, the Kings, and Countreys foes,</l>
            <l>And will of such proceedings brag and vaunt,</l>
            <l>Let them I say remain still ignorant.</l>
            <l>

Let the Concomitants of such a warre</l>
            <l>Attend them; and let them wax worse by farre,</l>
            <l>Till God hath finish'd his good work, upon</l>
            <l>This Land, and brought them to confusion.</l>
            <l>Now little book flie on the wings of fame,</l>
            <l>As far beyond the place from whence I came</l>
            <l>As it is thither: that both North and South,</l>
            <l>And all the winds may have thee in their mouth,</l>
            <l>And take thy counsell: that from <hi>Cornwell</hi> and</l>

            <l>And <hi>Durham:</hi> yea from <hi>Dover</hi> in the East,</l>
            <l>To th'utmost bounds of <hi>Chester</hi> in the West,</l>
            <l>Thou mayest have audience: that our <hi>Heroes</hi> may</l>
            <l>Muster their Forces 'gainst that fatall day.</l>
            <l>Grave <hi>Essex</hi> the chief Leader of us all,</l>
