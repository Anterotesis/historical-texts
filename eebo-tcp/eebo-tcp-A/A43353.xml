            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And herein our own Countrymen, have been as ſucceſsfully inquiſitive, as any other their Contemporaries whatſoever. No wonder then if in ſuch an Age, I, imitating their example, have thought fit, to give this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, of my leiſure, to the world; but
<pb facs="tcp:41619:3"/>
that I offer it to the protection of ſo great a Patron; the reaſons, perhaps, are not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, as neceſſary. For as the Novelty of ſo unexpected a method, as I here propoſe, will undoubtedly expoſe it to the calumny of ſuch, who (rather than give themſelves the trouble of examining the truth of it, being betimes perſwaded, that they already know as much as is to be learnt) will ſoon condemn it, both of folly and innovation. So it ſeems of abſolute neceſſity, that it bear with it the ſplendid name of ſome great Perſonage, the better to beſpeak the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Readers charitable Cenſure. Whoſe name then could I more hopefully have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed, than that of your Lordſhips, a perſon ſo Noble by deſcent, ſo Eminent by your Great and Honorable Imployments, and ſo deſervedly beloved and admired of all for that excellent compoſure of Greatneſs and Goodneſs, ſo remarkable in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; which attempt of mine, if it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a favourable Interpretation, I ſhall be obliged to continue</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Hold it not unſuitable to our deſign in this Treatiſe (where I have ſo often occaſion to make mention of it) that ſomething be ſaid by way of Preface, concerning the Air. Not that I intend to treat of it's firſt or ſecond qualities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which I leave to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophers conſideration, much leſs of the Elaſtic power of it, in Pneumatick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines; already ſo well performed by others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially by the Honorable <hi>Robert Boyl,</hi> in his moſt accurate Treatiſe on that Subject: my purpoſe here being only to preſent my Reader, with ſome few obſervables concerning Air, the better to confirm and illuſtrate, what follows in the Treatiſe it ſelf: eſpecially in the Chapter of Fermentation. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Air is of ſome very general uſe, may well appear from its being ſo great in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitarian, as it is. No place almoſt without it, no body (perhaps) but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating, more or leſs, of it; inſomuch, that
<pb facs="tcp:41619:4"/>
even in metals themſelves, the ſound of them, it reckoned an affection of the Air included in them. And if the tranſparency of Bodies be to be imputed to their porouſneſs, or rather to the ſtreightneſs or rectitude of their pores, (as its almoſt generally agreed on by Modern Writers) it will follow, that there is a great proportion of Air in the hardeſt Gemmes. Which is yet more manifest in ſofter ſtones, and becomes the cauſe of their moldring and cracking (after they are taken out of the Quarrey, and expoſed to the weather) which ſome ſort of ſtones are very ſubject to: For the impriſoned Air, that while it was in the cold bowels of the Earth, lay very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed or compreſſed, afterward ſymbolizing with the Air of a thinner Medium, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dilates its ſelf, and after ſome time ſo weakens the continuity of parts, that at laſt becoming too ſtrong for it, the ſtone breaks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many pieces, which will ſooner happen if the ſame be thrown into the fire: the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Air, in ſuch caſe, with much more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence dilating its ſelf, than in the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment. Plants ſeem to owe their very life and being to this included Air: for not ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving hearts, or other principal of motion in
<pb facs="tcp:41619:4"/>
them, (that we know of) for the diſtributing of the Sap: the included Air ſeems to ſupply that defect, after this manner. In the day time, in hot weather, and generally as often as the Air of the Medium, is dilated or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: the Air included, in the body of every Vegetable, ſuffers after the ſame manner, and has its dimenſions and tone varied. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe two conſiderable effects follow, to wit, that upon the dilatation of the internal or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Air, the parts of the Vegetable are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended (ſomewhat) according to their trinal dimenſion, whereby the Plant grows bigger and taller. And again, upon the compreſſion of the internal Air, room is made for the water or ſap, to riſe up, through the pores of the Plant, exactly after the manner of the Weather-glaſs: where the compreſſion of the Air becomes the cauſe of the aſcent of the water. And thus according to theſe periods of heat and cold, and the conſequent rarity and denſity of the included Air, and that of the Medium; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Plant makes, as it were, ſo many meals, or is ſo often refreſhed, by the aſcending Sap, which aſcent is alſo not a little promoted, by thoſe gentle Vibrations from the winds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the parts of Vegetables (and conſequently
<pb facs="tcp:41619:5"/>
the included Air) are moderately compreſſed and dilated reciprocally; wherrupon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid effects follow, even after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as is ſaid of the Swing, and in the laſt Chapter of this Treatiſe. The included Air ſerves likewiſe in Vegetables (as in all other bodies) for the maturing and fermenting the juices in them, in ſuch manner as is hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expreſſed. A farther confirmation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be hence had, that the moſt vegetous plants, and ſuch as we call <hi>Ever-Greens,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound most with Air in them: as appears when they are thrown into the fire, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent eruption of it. And there is, I think, no vegetable that has not one great pore or Pipe running from the root to the very top of it. Farther, in the Sea wrack, or <hi>Quercus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi> 'tis obvious for every one to obſerve a very particular and curious contrivance of Nature, for the nouriſhment of that plant, by the help of Air after this ſort. The plant as always faſtened to ſome ſtone; and as it branches out, with jagged leafs, ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thoſe of the Oak: it hath ſeveral little Bliſters or Bladders on it (ſome where of I have ſeen as big as a ſmall Pullets Egg.) Now upon the coming in of the Tide, the water
<pb facs="tcp:41619:5"/>
riſing this weed by means of the ſaid Bladders floats; and if the Stone be not too heavy Boys it up. (and hangs in the water like a Net that hath Corks and Leads to it) whereupon the Plant is conſiderably ſtretched; and again, upon the ſubſiding of the water, receives its nouriſhment, as in the former inſtance of other vegetables, though perhaps not from the root, being faſtened to a ſtone, but by the poroſe ſurface of its body. And laſtly, that there is much Air diſſeminated through the bodies of Animals, is manifeſt from their food: herbs and water, both which participate of it in good quantity. A notable argument whereof in water, may be, that it doth upon ſuch eaſie terms riſe up in a vapour, and mingle its mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute and inſenſible parts with the Air. For as the water grows warm, either by the heat of the Sun or fire, the ſmall parts of Air di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, make haſte to the top of the water, where they frame themſelves, with ſome of the water, into little bubbles; and are carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the motion of the Air or Medium, like thoſe bubbles made by Children, with Soap and water. And this perhaps may be one reaſon, why Rain water is better for plants, then other water, becauſe it has more air in it; a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb facs="tcp:41619:6"/>
whereof the Scale may afford us. And this is manifest in wine even to ſenſe: from which (if it be brisk and freſh, and poured from on high, into a glaſs) you ſhall firſt ſee a great number of little bubbles, or floating parcels of Air riſe up, with ſuch force, as to mount neer a foot, above the ſurface of the wine. But it is not enough for us to have proved great quantities of Air in all mixed bodies, unleſs it be at the ſame time allowed us, that the Air be actually and formally there as in the Medium or open Air, ſuffering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but barely an impriſonment, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement only, which is already ſufficiently made out by the uſes lately aſſigned it in vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, (unleſs they may be otherways more commodiouſly explained) beſides, that the poſſibility of converting one ſubſtance into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, was yet never ſo clearly taught, as to become intelligible, and has at this day but few Aſſerters of it.</p>
            <p>In contemplation of all which particulars and that the Air alone, of all Simple Bodies is capable of dilatation and constriction (or call it rarity and denſity) yet, not by any power to move it has of its ſelf, but as it is moved more or leſs, by the preſence or abſence,
<pb facs="tcp:41619:6"/>
the neerneſs or remoteneſs of the Sun (the heart and Center of this worldly Syſtem in which we live) I thought it a matter worth my pains (though perhaps exceeding my abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) to aſſay whether all fermentation, were not reducible to this ſimple motion of the Air, and did not depend on it, as on a general and more univerſal cauſe; which if I fail not in, it will be no very difficult matter, to reduce all other motions in the world, to that of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and probably to reſolve many hard queſtions, not as yet ſo rightly determined. But becauſe contemplations of this kind, are, in their own Nature, very unprofitable, if not reducible to practiſe: I have, as well as I could, applied the ſame to the cure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of moſt diſeaſes: as will ſomewhat more at large appear by the enſuing Treatiſe. Which I have ſuffered to undergo the publick view, with this aſſurance, that if the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o promiſe too much) by a new and hitherto unheard of method.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41619:8"/>3 The moſt general properties of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation are theſe: that the Maſs ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented ſuffers an eminent alteration in all its uſual wayes of affecting our ſenſes, as well in its firſt as ſecond qualities: they are either exalted or depreſſed, they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times changed for their contrary, and in a word, relation being had to our eſteem of things thus fermented, all fermentation may be ſaid to be either perfective or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, though in it ſelf it be but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued flux: as for inſtance in an apple, or the like, that from a green auſtere bud, firſt acquires its due perfection, and after by a continuation of that fermentation, that ripened it, at laſt arrives at corruption, and ſo changes both its name and nature together.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Another eminent property of fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is that for the moſt part the Body fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented doth occupy more ſpace than the ſame did before, which is very evident in the drowned bodies of men or other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which though at firſt they go to the bottom, yet after a certain time do ſlowly boye themſelves up again to the top of the water, not for that the breaking of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41619:9"/>
Gall becomes the cauſe of their aſcending: (as ſome even knowing men have ſuffered themſelves to be perſwaded) but becauſe ſuch bodies formerly heavier than water, quantity for quantity, and conſequently apt to ſink, have now acquired a larger dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, while they however increaſe not their weight, and ſo becoming lighter than the water contained in the like ſpace are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded by it to the top where they by degrees ſwell yet bigger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have ſeen a dog lye with more than one halfe of his body above the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the water, and it is no more than happens in a pound of Glaſs, metal or other heavy material, which in a ſolid Maſs ſinks to the bottom, but if blown or wrought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bottle, it keeps the top of the water: all which together with the reaſon is well enough known to ſuch as have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in ſtatick Experiments.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Another very uſeful property of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation is, that while it ſeparates all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous parts, it leaves the Baſis as it were, or main ingredient of the Maſs clear and limpid, if not hindred by the den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the body, and throws off two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41619:9"/>
or ſuperfluities, one a heavier de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcending to the bottom, the other of a lighter more frothy ſubſtance, which takes its place at the top of the liquor: as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in Wine, Sider and the juices of other fruits: in Beer made with Barly, and the decoctions of other grains, firſt, maulted and grown'd. This happens not in Bread becauſe the greateſt part of the Maſs be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing the more ſolid, the leſs or watry par<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> takes its flight on all ſides to the circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ference, though ſomewhat more ſlowly and there coagulates into a blew mould.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another noble property of Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, is, that it exalts the body fermented to what perfection it is capable of, but then it is requiſite that the body fermented be of ſuch a conſiſtence, as may not be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented too faſt, as in fruits, upon trees: or if thin, that it be cloſe ſtop't in ſome full Veſſel, as all kind of drinks: or if o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> middle conſiſtence, that it be often ſtirred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is obſerved by Apothecaries in the making of Treacle, and other ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſitions, which afterward will keep a very long time. For thus it is neceſſary, that that ſpirit (as we will call it for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41619:10"/>
which ferments the Maſs, be for a while detained either by the tone of the body, by ſome ſtrong veſſel; or that it be often re-effuſed, as it were, upon its body, that ſo by its long, difficult and reiterated working, it may at laſt find out ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity amongſt the leſs Heterogeneous parts, and cauſe a kind of complanation of the whole Maſs, and it ſelf with leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, be detained in the Body or Maſs.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Another very General property of Fermentation is, that all bodies, almoſt by it, at laſt become acide: as is manifeſt in all liquors, decoctions of fleſh, or herbs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuaries, ſirups, &amp;c. by which acidity I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not that ſowre taſte, obſervable in moſt green fruits, which is rather to be termed acerbity, and differs as much from what we here ſpeak of, as Agreſta (the juyce of green grapes expreſt) doth from Vinegar.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In the next place, let us briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the cauſes of Fermentation, the moſt immediate of which, ſeems to be the Air, contained in every mixt body: for as I noted before, all bodies fermented, do occupy a larger room, than they did before
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41619:10"/>
fermentation: which cannot be duely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, to any other ingredient in mixt bodies, than to the air, for that it hath not yet been found, by ſufficient experiment, that any body whatſoever is capable of rarifaction and condenſation; or dilation and conſtruction beſides air: as for Leaf Gold, what it got in one dimenſion, it loſt in the other, and all the parts of Gold calcined, do but equal the Maſs they were made of, no more than if the ſame had been redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to an impalpable powder by means of a very fine file. The ſame is to be underſtood of water evaporated by heat: which is only a comminution of it, into exceeding ſmall parts, and no way a converſion of it into air (as hath been formerly received) which is from hence evidenced, that ſuch vapours by the Alembic, are again reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſame liquors from whence they were firſt raiſed, viz. into Roſewater or ſpirit of Wine, which were no more poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if they had been really converted into air, then out of common air to draw Roſe-water or ſpirit of Wine, and if water, or milke or other liquor take up more room when boyling on the fire, then they did
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41619:11"/>
cold, 'tis by reaſon that the particles of air, formerly not viſible are now conſiderably dilated, ſo as to become obſervable to the eye.</p>
            <p n="9">9. As the Air contained in mixt bodies, is the moſt immediat efficient cauſe of Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: ſo it needs, exciting and actuating, for the moſt part, as well by the temper and tone of the <hi>Medium,</hi> as from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, of this or that particular Ferment as of leven yeaſt, Renet, or the like: of which perhaps we ſhall have farther occaſion to ſpeak more, hereafter, and at preſent only conſider how the <hi>Medium</hi> eſpecially the Ambient Air, excites the internal air in the work of Fermentation.</p>
            <p n="10">10. By the Tone of the Air, I underſtand the meaſure of its rarity and denſity and eſpecially its reciprocations or frequent acceſs and receſs to this or that degree of rarity and denſity. Now, that one Air is rarer than another as that of hills, then that of the valleys, that of ſouthern Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, then that of the more Northern: is I think an undoubted truth: alſo that the Air of every particular place is ſometimes rarer ſometimes denſer according to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41619:11"/>
ſeveral ſeaſons of the year, times of the day and night, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> needs no other proof then that of the Weather-glaſs. By the temperature of the Air, I mean its degree and difference of heat and cold, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the ſame conſiderations of place and time as before, and is not only proved by the Weather-glaſs, but even by ſenſe it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The manner how the Ambient works upon the internal air in mixed bodies, is the ſame with that of the Weather-glaſs, where the incloſed air is rarified, and condenſed, heated and cooled accordingly, as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium is affected: So in bodies fermented, eſpecially liquors, the imperceptible parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of air being gently and by degrees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, become the cauſe that the whole Maſs doth occupy more and more room, or encreaſes its dimenſions under the ſame weight, whereupon this effect immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, that ſeveral Heterogeneous Particles, which before floated in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and were (as I may ſay) equilibrous with the ſame, do now gently deſcend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the bottom, in order, according to their weight: The ſmall Particles of air in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41619:12"/>
the mean while being more and more dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted do, together with the more viſcous parts of the liquor (of which they form themſelves Coats or Integuments) gently aſcend to the top of the Maſs, where they make that frothy head or ſcum obſervable in Sider, Wine, Beer, and other liquors; and this I take to be the natural method of all ferment<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion when not checked, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe determined by ſome outward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: And this alſo ſeems a genuine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the depuration, and of the caſting off the heavier and lighter recrement men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before (N. 5.) to happen in ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liquors.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That Bodies are ripened and acquire their due perfection by fermentation, is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted N. 6. but in ſuch caſe it is neceſſary, that this fermentation be checked or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded in ſuch ſort as is there mentioned, both in natural and more artificial fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: But the moſt univerſal Moderator of this motion, is what was lately call'd the tone of Air, as well as its temperature, which daily and hourly changing, doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerate, retard, check and put backward this motion, and then reſtores it again; by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41619:12"/>
which various, and oft repeated courſe, the parts are comminuted, their roughneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunded and mitigated, and they ſo diſpoſed of, after an inexplicable manner, as condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces moſt to the beauty and perfection of the Body fermented.</p>
            <p n="13">13. This dilatation and conſtriction in Bodies fermented, cauſed by the like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Ambient Air, may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly be compared with the pulſe in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals having its <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as they have, though by longer peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, as of day and night, warm weather and cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and from hence perhaps is the true cauſe of pulſes in Animals to be lookt for, which yet as forreign to our preſent ſcope we here enquire not farther after; but it will not be improper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve (with common experience) that Malt is beſt made in windy weather, and that the beſt and moſt laſting Beer is brewed in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> (windy moneths, and of an unequal temper) Now 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that all winds are moved by guſts rather then equal fluxes (from whence probably it is that the Sea is lifted into Waves, as it were numbring to us the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41619:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
impetuous ſtroaks it received from the winds.) Thus the motion of all Animals ſeems to be performed by ſnatches and jerks; and it is indeed a great queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong School-Philoſophers, whether any local motion be (ſtrictly ſpeaking) continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and not rather conſiſting, of ſhort moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and frequent reſts, as it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded together. This Pulſe, or frequent change in the tone of the Air, however it may ſeem at firſt view an idle or over-ſubtil contemplation, will upon due conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be found not only true, and the cauſe of thoſe effects aſſigned to it in the foregoing Paragraph, but that it may alſo with good effect be made uſe of in Phyſick, as a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtrument for preſervation of health, and the cure of diſeaſes. I ſhall hereafter endeavour to prove in the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. That moſt liquors fermented, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the beginning, conceive heat, and become warm, even to ſenſe the reaſon, may be partly gathered out of what has been already ſaid; namely, that the ſmall particles of Air in ſuch liquor become di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, which dilatation is always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with an encreaſe of heat, they mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41619:13"/>
making way for, and introducing one the other (in the Air and bodies participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Air) if not hindred from without; to which may be added, that all motion is apt to beget heat in the Body moved, which is true not only of ſolid Bodies, though more eminently in them, but alſo of liquid Bodies themſelves. Thus 'tis ſaid in making Butter, you muſt neither make too much at once, nor yet muſt it be too violently beaten or ſhaken, for in ſuch caſe there will be great hazard of over-heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Butter, which as you ſee is the meer effect of motion in a liquid Body only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beſides moſt liquors fermented, abou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

ſhall only obſerve, that congenerous Bodies ſuffer moſt, and are beſt fermented by their own proper ferments, namely Ale by yeaſt, Dough by Leven, Milk by Renet. Thus Apples, Pears and Grapes, and generally all fruit, once corrupted or rotten, do more eaſily affect and putrifie thoſe of their own kind then of any other; I ſay more eaſily, for they will, though with more difficulty, and after a longer time, corrupt fruits of a divers kind alſo; and thoſe particular Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens before-mentioned, will in like manner (though probably not ſo naturally) ferment <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the trying to underſtand, whether a Maſs of Dough made with flower and ſnow on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, would need any other raiſing or Leven. I have read, that in the Countryes about <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza,</hi> whence thoſe ſo much valued Parmiſan Cheeſes come, the people make uſe of Snow inſtead of Renet. This inſtance however of the white of an Egg beaten, may ſerve very well to illuſtrate our Poſition concerning the fermentation of Bodies by the dilatation and conſtriction of its aereous Particles: as alſo the kneding of Dough, and ſhaking of liquors (which is a kind of kneding too) the better to make them riſe and work, will notably confirm what we ſaid of the Tone of the Air, its frequent alterations, and of windy weather, how much they conduce to the better fermentation of moſt Bodies.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Note, that the reaſon why the juices of moſt fruits do ſoon after expreſſion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a ſtrong fermentation, ſeems to be this, that not only the liquor is now more at liberty, then when mixed with the fleſhy parts of the fruit, but likewiſe that the Airy Particles lay very much compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the fruit, every particular Grape,

Cherry and Apple, being in the nature of a little Bottle, which as we ſee, if well ſtopt, hinders the working of Ale or Wine, but once opened, the liquors ſtraightway fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſwell very impetuouſly, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Air forcibly dilating it ſelf; and this is the reaſon that fruit a little eaten by the Birds or Snails, will ripen much faſter than if they had not been entered upon, (but then the taſte will not be altogether ſo generous and ſprightly.) Thus Apples and Pears gather'd green and hoarded, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſooner far, than if they had continued hanging on the Trees, for that they now receive ſome vent at their ſtalks; and I find the Ancients were wont to plant the <hi>Caprificus</hi> (or wild Fig-tree) neer their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther domeſtick Fig-trees, that ſo the Flees which in great quantities are bred out of the fruit of the <hi>Caprificus,</hi> may ſeize and pierce the Figs of the other trees, as they do in ſeveral places, thereby not only acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating their time of maturity, but alſo (which perhaps is particular to this kind of fruit) rendring them much more tender and delightful than otherwiſe they would have been, had no ſuch Artifice been made
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41619:15"/>
uſe of. Now as we have ſaid, this kind of fermentation whereby fruits attain their maturity, bears a very due proportion with that obſerved in botled drinks, which if well ſtopt are ſlower in ripening (but of better taſte) than in open veſſels: as alſo if placed in cold well-vaulted Cellars, then if expoſed to the Air: and that for this reaſon, that the difference of heat and cold (eſpecially in Summer) is by many degrees more in the open Air, than in ſuch ſubterraneous Vaults, and conſequently the Aerous Particles, contained in ſuch ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liquors, are more dilated and conſtricted (reciprocally) when expoſed to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than if laid up in Cellars, or buried in the ground. Which reciprocation of the tone of Air, we have already aſſerted to be the principal, if not the only cauſe of all fermentation. And it may be farther illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, by a common practiſe of botling up Wine, or other drink, with a lump of Loaf-ſugar in it, which will make it much more brisk and lively. And this it d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th, not by its ſweetneſs ſure, for that were apter to clog and tame it, as is found by practiſe; or if it did, then Syrup of Sugar, or a ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:41619:16"/>
of powder Sugar, might indifferently produce the ſame effect: which yet is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tradicted by experience. Nay, I dare confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirm, that the like quantity of the fame Loaf-ſugar, firſt done into very fine powder, will not ſerve the turn. So that I cannot imagine other reaſon, why the lump of Loaf-ſugar is of that uſe, put into bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than that being very porous, it conveys with it ſelf, a great quantity of air into the liquor: and does in effect no more, than what has been already ſaid of the whites of Eggs beaten up together into a froth. So it is not the Sugar, but the air contained in the ſugar, which mends the fermentation of the drink, and whereby the Sugar ſupplies the place of an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ferment, the better to excite the working of the liquor.</p>
            <p n="16">16. And laſtly, methinks it might alone ſerve turn, to convince us of the great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy the air hath, and the power it exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth on all or moſt mixed Bodies: what we finde to manifeſt by experience in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of fleſh, fruits, the Bodies of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, and other the like, whether for ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or curioſity only, and that with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

other preparation many times, than by barely immerſing them in wax, oyl, butter, ſewet, ſome Gum or Roſine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carefully putting them up into Veſſels well ſtopped. By which practiſe we ſeem to obtain little elſe, than that we do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as it were, conceal thoſe Bodies, thus preſerved, from the air, which would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, in a ſhort time, have totally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted them: their long continuance and preſervation ſeeming to follow, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of that artificial excluſion of the air, whereby the Bodies (or rather the air in them) are no longer apt to be affected, according to the various diſpoſitions of the Medium.</p>
            <p>Farther, it is well worth our Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Chyle, Milk, Cream, the ſeeds of all Vegetables, and even that of Animals it ſelf, ſeem to owe their whiteneſs, to the interſperſion or diſſemination of air only: even after the ſame manner, as is already obſerved in Snow, and ſome other Bodies.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> That Chylification is a ſort of Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and how diſtribution is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THe Stomack or Ventricle in animals, deſigned by Nature for the Office of Chylification, commonly called the firſt Concoction (and which is, as it were, the root of all Vegetation or nutrition in them) ſeems at firſt birth but ill fitted for ſuch a work, till the Coats or Membrances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, have been well ſtained or ſeaſoned by the receipt of an aliment ſo prepared, that it want little more than warmth, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of that operation upon it, which is expected from the Stomack. And thus, for all animals that ſuck, Nature has provided for their firſt food, a kind of corrupted Milk, uſually called Beaſtings, which gives, as it were, the firſt tincture to their tender Stomacks, and whereby they ſeem enabled to concoct more perfect Milk,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41619:17"/>
which they begin to draw after a day or two. Which Milk alſo by degrees becomes more thick and harder of concoction, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the encreaſe of ſtrength, in the ſtomack it ſelf, till by little and little, they begin to alter their diet, and forſake the Teat, for ſuch other food as is moſt proportionable to their reſpective Natures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Tincture, thus imprinted on the Stomack, may very properly be termed a ferment, and ſeems to bear a juſt proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Leven, which is a ſmall part of the Maſs of Dough, ſuffered to grow ſowre, while the reſt is converted into bread, which if not hindred, would have all turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into leven likewiſe. Thus after the Chyle is conveyed from the Stomack into the Guts, from thence to be diſtributed through the whole Body: ſome ſmall part that remains ſticking to the coats of the Stomack, ſoon after acquires that acidity, due to all fermentation not interrupted: which after ſome time begins to grieve and afflict the Stomack with its ſharpneſs: the ſenſe whereof, we uſually call hunger: which ſenſe of pain (or hunger) continues to grow more and more, (that which cauſed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41619:18"/>
it becoming ſtill ſharper and ſharper) till by the reception of new aliment, the acidi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of the ſaid Tincture or Leven, be ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated and allayed, that the Stomack be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were, healed by application of theſe new, benigne, and uncorrupted juices, is no longer ſenſible of any pain or moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which then puts an end to the deſire of eating. But if food be forborn, or withheld, the pain ſo long encreaſes, till it at laſt deſtroys the ſenſe of the part, and introduces a ſphalelus, Gangrene or Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Stomack: which is afterward ſoon conveyed to the heart and brain, by its communion of Veſſels, and ſo at length becomes the death of the Animal. Which ſeems rather to be the cauſe of death, in ſuch as periſh by hunger, than the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or inanition of the Veſſels, which, though much exhauſted, are yet found in ſuch caſes, with a conſiderable quantity of blood in them. Nay, 'tis a frequent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia</hi> (as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſome that have travelled in the Levant) to let their Camels blood after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days faſting, and to give them their own blood to drink, as the laſt means left
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41619:18"/>
to preſerve their lives. Which practiſe, as it cannot repleniſh the veins, to that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it already emptied them: ſo it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently concludes, that emptineſs of the Veſſels, is not the true cauſe, of periſhing for want of food. Much leſs can the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Suction, from the exhauſted Veſſels to the Stomack, be the cauſe of hunger. For firſt, ſuch hunger could not be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately appeaſed after eating, the Veſſels receiving no part thereof, till a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time after, when diſtribution begins to ſucceed concoction, as is well known and confeſſed. Secondly, 'twill appear to ſuch as ſhall duly conſider it, that the Veſſels or Veins are then fulleſt, when the Stomack is emptieſt <hi>(&amp; è contra)</hi> the emptying of the Stomack, beginning with the filling of the Guts, and Veins. Nor ſhall we need o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments, againſt this Suction (though it were eaſie to charge it with more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) than that the owners of it, will be forced to prove, there is ſome ſuch power of moving by attraction, drawing or Sucti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which will be a harder matter than it appears at firſt ſight. Though as not making to our preſent purpoſe, I ſhall not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ought, concerning it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:41619:19"/>3. In confirmation of this our Aſſertion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That the concoction of the ſtomack is a kind of fermentation, it will not b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to ſhew the reaſon of ſome circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it. And firſt, concerning that prepa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration, which meat receives in the mouth, by chewing or jawing of it, which is rather a bruiſing than mincing: and it is a common obſervation, that fleſh minced very ſmall, is of much harder concoction, than if eaten by bigger pieces; and a ſufficient reaſon is withall aſſigned, that meat minced, ſlips down into the ſtomack, before it be duly maſticated or chewed, which is ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an antecedent of concoction, that the Arabian Phyſitians are wont to ſay, <hi>That he that chaws not his meat well, hates his own Soul.</hi> Now that any thing bruiſed will ſoon after corrupt, is evident in all fruits: which will ſooner putriſie, after bruiſing, than if they were cut with a ſharp knife in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many pieces. Thus a fleſh-wound, made without bruiſing, will commonly heal again with little or no corruption, but not if the part were bruiſed at the ſame time. Thus the common practiſe is to bruiſe Whitloes, to ripen and break them the ſooner. And
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41619:19"/>
thus to conclude, our meat by being brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, becomes of much eaſier and ſpeedier concoction, which ſeems to be the reaſon why Nature has given to moſt Creatures, namely, Dogs, Wolfes, Swine, Foxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> three ſorts of teeth; to wit, Tusks to kill their prey with, ſharp fore-teeth or cutters, wherewith they tear it into ſmaller pieces: And laſtly, Grinders to chew and bruiſe it, the better to prepare it for the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.</p>
            <p>Birds ſeem to grinde their meat in their Gizards, after it is firſt well ſoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their craps, for which purpoſe they pick up ſharp ſtones, and their ſtomacks are made of two large Muſcles; one, on either ſide: the chief inſtruments in this work of Moliture, or grinding. The Locuſta or Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters has his teeth placed in his ſtomack, and ſo have the reſt of that kind, which they imploy for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our next obſervation ſhall be upon two Rules of Diet, commonly given by Phyſitians: the one is, that we ſhould not put new meat into our ſtomack, till after a perfect digeſtion of what was eaten the meal before: the reaſon of which Rule,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41619:20"/>
ſeems to be this; That it is neceſſary th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſtomack, ſhould continue ſome time empty, that ſo the Fracid Tincture, or ſmall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted remaining portion, of the former meat, may have acquired its due acidity: whereby it may the better help the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fermentation or concoction. And it is no more than if you ſhould adviſe the Houſe-wife, not to make any new Bread till the Leven be grown ripe, or ſowre enough to leven and ferment the Maſs of Dough. The ſecond Rule is, that we ſhould leave eating, with ſome ſmall appetite to eat on; or that we ſhould riſe from Table with an appetite: the reaſon is almoſt the ſame with the former, and may well be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by the ſame inſtance, which is, that it is requiſite, the Leven ſhould bear ſome juſt proportion, to the Maſs it is to ferment. Thus if we riſe with an appetite, it will appear that we have not over-char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this ferment of our ſtomacks, for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite being, as is ſaid, a ſenſe of pain cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſharpneſs of this acid ferment; it follows, that this acidity is not yet quite obſcured by the late mixture of good, and conſequently the ſtomack, not charged with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41619:20"/>
more, than may be well digeſted, at once by <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. And theſe are Rules, very fit to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as well by thoſe which are of a more robuſt nature, as of them (eſpecially) who have weak ſtomacks, and find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves indiſpoſed after eating.</p>
            <p n="5">5. 'Tis further adviſed by ſome Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that ſuch as have weak ſtomacks, ſhould forbear drinking, till they have neer dined: and we commonly obſerve, that drinking juſt before dinner, ſpoils our eating, which it does, by diluting this ferment of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, whereupon the ſenſe of pain, and conſequently hunger, abates very much, or quite ceaſes for a time. And 'tis uſually ſeen, that they who are great Drinkers, are bad Trencher-men: and that as well, for that much drinking relaxes the tone, and extenuates the coats of the ſtomack, as more eſpecially, for that it waſhes away by little and little, all this fracid tincture, or ſowre ferment, of the membranes thereof, which is as well the cauſe of concoction, as of appetite or hunger.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Bulls Blood drunk, was found a preſent poyſon by the Ancients, and Milk taken plentifully, and after curdling on the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41619:21"/>
has often been the cauſe of great and mortal Surfeits: the reaſon of both is the ſame; for that, both blood and milk being curdled, and brought into one hard lump, becomes inſuperable to the ſtomack. Whereas, if the ſame be ſuffered to coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late (before they be eaten) and broken into ſmall parts, they will have no ſuch effect, and inſtead of poyſoning, will afford an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different good nouriſhment to the body: So far ſeems <hi>Helmont</hi> to have miſſed the mark, when he ſays, <hi>The cauſe of this poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, Imago Irae, in Sanguine Taurino.</hi> And I doubt not but a lump of Beef, or a piece of Cheeſe, of the ſame bigneſs, whole in the ſtomack, would as ſurely poyſon, if not more effectually. And this may farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, what is ſaid in the third paragraph, of preparing our Food, by chawing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. The inward membranes, or skins of the Gizards of moſt Birds (eſpecially ſuch as feed on corn) prepared, by drying and powdring them, are held a great help to concoction. Now the acidity of them is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manifeſt, and no doubt they do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe comfort our ſtomacks, than by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing and corroborating that ferment ſo
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41619:21"/>
often mentioned. Thus, the dung of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Animals prepared, namely of Wolves, Dogs, Peacocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been approved of in divers diſeaſes, or diſtempers of the ſtomack and guts, for the ſame cauſe. Nay, I have heard that <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> his Occidental Civet prepared, will make an excellent Peptick, for them that can diſpenſe with ſuch homely remedies.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It is a famous Queſtion among Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Whether it be better to make a meal of one only diſh of meat, or to eat of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral meats at the ſame ſetting? and it is commonly determined, in favour of the ſimpler diet. But it ſeems more conſonant to our Opinion, to allow rather of ſeveral diſhes; for that which is eaſie of concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will help to concoct that which is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Thus good Sauces to meats make them ſet eaſie, and light, upon the ſtomack: the Sauces (being eaſie of concoction) helping the diſſolution of the meats. And we may ſurely expect, a heartier nouriſhment from them, than ſingle diſhes; as we find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, better broth to be made of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of fleſh, than of any one; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the more variety, the more perfect
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41619:22"/>
is the pottage. And its well known, we are nouriſhed by juices only, and not by the ſolid part of our food.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Where this ferment of the ſtomack is more acid than is requiſite (as it is in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal perſons, and ſuch as are troubled with ſowre belches) 'tis found by experience, that to make two, three, or four meals in a day, is better than one: and that faſting encreaſes much the acidity. Tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hard meats, as dry bread, Biſcuits, and thoſe that are leſs eaſie concoction, are more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than Broths (and other light meats:) which will ſometimes (eſpecially taken in a morning, the ferment after long emptineſs becoming extraordinary ſowre) work ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently, that they will flow up into the mouth, and with their eagerneſs, ſet the teeth an edge, and ferment the very ground. But both in this, and the former rule, 'twill be neceſſary to take ſome care, that we do not eat much more of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſhes, than we ſhould have eat of one, and that the quantity of our meat, at many meals, but equals, or not much exceeds, what we ſhould have eaten at once or twice.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41619:22"/>10. 'Tis obſerved, that ſudden change of diet has ſometimes proved very fatal, and been often the occaſion of dangerous diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The reaſon may well be, that the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, having received its tincture or ferment from food of another nature, is but ill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the concoction of thoſe meats, to which it hath not been accuſtomed, and from which it has as yet received no ſtain or impreſſion. Such changes therefore muſt be made by degrees; and thus I have heard, that horſes have been brought to live upon fleſh: and ſome men, have indifferently well ſupported life, with bread and herbs only.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Wolves are ſaid, when preſſed with extremity of hunger, ſometimes to tear the ground, and fill their panches with meer earth: which ſurely affords them lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no nouriſhment. But it ſerves for the preſent, to abate the edge of their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, till they meet with ſome prey, at which time, they eaſily diſcharge their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks of the earth, and fall to better meat. This inſtance may indifferently well ſupport our Aſſertion, that hunger is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſenſe of pain from the acid ferment
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41619:23"/>
of the ſtomack, than of emptineſs from the Suction of the veins.</p>
            <p n="12">12. As concoction ſucceeds beſt with reſt, ſo motion is ſaid to help diſtribution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now by diſtribution, we are to underſtand the diſperſing, of the thinner parts of the Chyle into the milky veins, from thence into the Subclavials, thence into the right Ventricle of the heart, where the Chyle already is pretty well ſtained, or imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mingled with blood: from whence it takes its courſe to the lungs, where by the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procations of that part, it is yet more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, mixed with the blood. From the lungs, it deſcends into the hearts left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle: from whence, it is thrown into the Arteries: where by degrees it receives the form and name of blood: and by them is conveyed into all parts of the body. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the milky veins, have no attractive power, whereby the Chyle might be ſuckt into them (as far as could yet be fairly made appear) nor has the Chyle (much leſs) any ſuch inclination or power of moving it ſelf that way; it remains, that this diſtribution of the Chyle, is performed by the motion of the body. And thus we find moderate

exerciſe, ſoon cauſes an emptineſs in the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>irſt ways, and begets an appetite. And yet we may likewiſe obſerve, that while we ſit ſtill, or ſleep, this diſtribution is performed, though not ſo ſpeedily. Now while we reſt, there is no other motion obſerveable, beſide that of breathing, which ſeems to be the true cauſe of this diſtribution of the Chyle, till it comes into the Subclavials: for when we draw in our breaths, the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme or Midriff compreſſeth the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and gently forceth the Chyle thence into the guts. And again, when we breath out, the Muſcles of the belly ſtraight ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and ſtrongly compreſs the guts; whereupon the thinner part of the Chyle inſinuates it ſelf into the mouths of the milky veins, and by the ſucceeding parts of the Chyle, is protruded into the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clavials, where afterward it is moved with the motion of the blood. I do not deny the Periſtaltick motion of the Inteſtines, (whereby the guts diſtended with Chyle beyond their due tone, do again by their tranſverſe fibres contract themſelves) for this is alſo a partial cauſe of diſtribution (as appears in the diſſection of live Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41619:24"/>
where this motion of the Chyle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues after the Abdomen or belly is laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen from one end to the other) but is much ſtrengthened, no doubt, by the Muſcles of the belly; beſides this Periſtaltick motion of the guts, ſhews indeed in part how they are emptied, but not how they are fitted with Chyle, which is the firſt part of diſtribution.</p>
            <p n="13">13. 'Tis worthy obſervation, that Butter melted, and very well beaten (or drawn) the while, becomes a much pleaſanter cauſe, and eaſier of digeſtion, than if it be not beaten; and yet all the difference is, that by beating a great quantity of Air, is every where mingled with it, whereby it very much helps the fermentation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of our meat in our ſtomacks, after the ſame manner as is already ſaid of whites of Eggs, in the former Chapter; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all ſauſes are a kind of additional fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. That there is great quantity of air in Butter thus beaten, may not only be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from hence, that after beating, it takes up more room than it did before, or otherwiſe would do, if not beaten; but the ſame particles of air are even manifeſt to

               <note n="inter">N. 1.</note>THat Animals breath not at all, while in the womb, is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that all viperous creatures, after the birth, cannot live long without breath, is moſt certain; yet I do not find the uſes of Reſpiration ſo clearly determined, but that it may afford us matter for farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. The common received Opinion is, that Reſpiration ſerves chiefly for cooling the heart, next that, it yields matter for production of new vital ſpirits; and laſtly, that it diſcharges the lungs of a fuliginous
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41619:25"/>
excrement, which ſeems to tranſſude from the Maſs of blood into the branches of the rough Artery: that the heart is cooled by breathing, is very probable, but not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; for the air going no farther than the lungs, firſt cools them, next the blood in them, and conſequently the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes leſs hot, than otherwiſe it would be; but this is, in effect, no more than is obtained by bathing the limbs in cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which does a together (if n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t more effectually) cool the Maſs of blood, as much as the air in breathing can be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to do it, and yet bathing will in no wiſe become a Subſtitute to breathing. Nor does the generation of vital ſpirits ſeem to be the chief uſe of the air in breathing, in regard it is not eaſie to conceive any ſuch contrivance in the lungs, that may ſerve for the letting in of air, into the veins and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, which contain the blood, without endangering, contrariwiſe, the effuſion of that precious juice, much leſs has Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as yet, diſcovered any ſuch paſſages unto us. Laſtly, as I ſhall not deny, but that the lungs do diſcharge themſelves of a fuliginous excrement by breathing; ſo I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41619:25"/>
think it as true, that this is none of the principal uſes of Reſpiration. Nor is it at all likely, that either the heart ſhould grow ſo hot, or that the vital ſpirits ſhould vaniſh ſo faſt, or the fuliginous excrement be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated in that quantity, upon the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of breathing for a ſhort time only, as to indanger our lives beyond recovery, as the abſolute neceſſity of Reſpiration would ſeem to inforce. Before I come to deliver my own Opinion, I ſhall make a ſlight digreſſion concerning the circulation of the blood, which will not a little illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate what we are about to ſay concerning this Subject.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis manifeſt in the circulation of the blood in Animals, that the blood is moved from the left Ventricle of the heart, through the great Artery, into all its bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, from whence it is brought back by the ſmaller veins, which diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Vena Cava, from whence it is returned into the right Ventricle of the heart, from whence it is ſent by the Vena Arterioſa into the lungs, and ſo brought back again into the left Ventricle of the heart by the Arteria Venoſa: And in this
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41619:26"/>
circular motion of the blood, life chiefly conſiſteth: and if the ſame by any chance ſhould ceaſe or intermit, though but for a very ſmall time (leſs than a minute) death would unavoidably follow. In this motion of the blood, it is obſervable firſt, that as the pulſation of the heart ſendeth it through the Arteries, into the whole habit of the body, ſo the return of it by the veins, ſeems to depend chiefly upon the tonical motion of the body; for the parts being extended by the flowing in of the blood, ſomewhat beyond their tone, do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain gently ſubſide, and thereby continue the intended courſe of the blood toward the heart again. An argument hereof is, that all Paralytick parts grow immediately cold, and that for no other reaſon, than that the tonical motion, together with the power Locomotive, ceaſing, the circulation is either very weakly, or not at all perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through that part, which then grows cold, for want of that conſtant freſh ſupply of blood, which formerly kept it warm. But herein the tonical motion is not a little helped by exerciſe and labour, which we find, by experience, to cauſe the heart to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41619:26"/>
beat quicker and oftner, as alſo to induce a neceſſity of breathing more frequently; and this it doth no otherwiſe, than by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerating this circular motion of the blood, which then enforceth the heart and lungs to double duty. Our ſecond obſervable in this circular motion of the blood is, that there paſſes as much blood from the right Ventricle of the heart into the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gs, at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very pulſe (taking one time with another) as is ſent from the left Ventricle into all the parts of the body beſide. Nor can it be otherwiſe, the left Ventricle being ſupplied from the lungs only; and the lungs recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, not elſewhere than from the right Ventricle of the heart. So, that to continue this circular motion of the blood, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, the ſupply neither exceed, nor come ſhort of that quantity, diſpenſed from the left Ventricle of the heart, into the whole body (the Lungs excepted.) From hence it follows, that there flows a greater quantity of blood, by many degrees, into the lungs, than what is ſufficient for its own private uſe. As alſo, that the blood in the lungs, muſt of neceſſity, move very much faſter, than it does in any part of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41619:27"/>
body: though we take for example, the great vein or artery themſelves: and that, in the ſame proportion, as the <hi>Vena Arterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> and <hi>Arteria Venoſa,</hi> are ſmaller than the trunks of the foreſaid great veſſels. For, let the ſame quantity of liquor be conveyed through a pipe, whoſe capacity is but one fourth, or one tenth, ſo big as another pipe, through which the like quantity muſt paſs in the ſame time: and it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the liquor muſt run four times, or ten times as faſt, through the ſmaller pipe, as it does through the greater. And thus, it appears, that a very conſiderable part of the Maſs of blood, is continually running through the Parenchyma of the lungs; and that, at a much ſwifter rate, than it doth, through any part of the whole body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Farther, before we proceed to treat of the uſe of Reſpiration, it will not be amiſs to conſider, what kind of motion that is which the lungs are exerciſed with, in breathing. Nor is it any other, than a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dilatation and conſtriction; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the lungs are reciprocally opened and ſhut, ſomewhat after the manner, of a pair
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41619:27"/>
of Organ-Bellows: the air entring into them, when dilated or opened, and rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding again, upon their ſubſiding. And this is what we call Reſpiration. Nor yet, does this reciprocation of the lungs, proceed from any power to move, they are endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with of themſelves. For, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the frame and ſtructure of them, they will appear of a Parenchymous kind of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not much unlike the liver, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together void of Muſcles; without which, no local motion can be performed. We may conclude therefore, that the lungs are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by conſent, and that chiefly of the Diaphragme or Midriff, in a free and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary breathing. But, in any difficulty of breathing, as in the Aſthma, Tabes, violent exerciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only the Midriff, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Muſcles of the trunk of the body, namely, thoſe of the Belly, Cheſt and Shoulders, ſeem to afford their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in this great work of Reſpiration. The motion of the Midriff is firſt down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; whereupon the lungs follow, and the air is admitted, and again upwards; whereby the lungs are compreſſed, and the air excluded. Thus you ſee, that as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41619:28"/>
of the Midriff, ſo is its motion, ſomewhat different from that of other Muſcles: which, as being well known, we ſhall not need to ſpend longer time about, but come to the publick uſe of the lungs, in the Oeconomy of our bodies.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the circulation of the blood, we aſcribed the reduction of it again into the right ventricle of the heart, to the Tonical motion of the body: where yet, as we have ſaid, the blood moves but very ſlowly, if compared, with that ſwift, and rapid moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is carried on with, through the lungs; where it moves, perhaps, ten times as faſt, as in any other part of the body; as has been already proved. Which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſhall not be able, upon peruſal of the ſtructure of the lungs, to conclude, that they are endowed with any conſiderable tonical motion, as may be gathered, as well from their want of Muſcles, as for that their ſubſtance, is very ſpongey and flaccid: and their common integument is but one thin membrane. Nor was it without a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and that a moſt excellent deſign: that Nature thus contrived the lungs with little or no tonical motion in them. For firſt, had this Tone been equivalent to the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41619:28"/>
Maſs of blood, to be returned by it; it would much have retarded the influx of the blood, into the lungs: and conſequently, have hindered a great work of Nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it there, as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter. But chiefly, for that it has largely ſupplied ſuch defect, by the aſſiſtance of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which becomes the cauſe, both of dilating, and contracting the lungs; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the occaſion, and at the will and pleaſure of the Animal. And this is, indeed, the firſt and principal Office of the lungs; as to what concerns their reciprocal moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Namely, that upon the ſubſiding of them, in Reſpiration, the blood may be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly ſqueezed out of them, through the <hi>Arteria Venoſa,</hi> into the hearts left Ventricle. And becauſe, the ſubſtance of the lungs is very tender; Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives, that not the Diaphragme immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the air incloſed in the cavity of the breſt (for this very purpoſe only) being firſt, ſtreightened and crowded, as it were, together, by the motion of the Diaphragm upward, ſhould cauſe this compreſſion upon the lungs; while by its Elaſtic pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it endeavours to dilate it ſelf again, to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41619:29"/>
its uſual dimenſions. Nor could any way of compreſſing the lungs, (thereby to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them of the ſuperfluous blood) have been contrived more equal: for this pent air, is as apt to preſs upon one part, as on another. Nor yet more gentle, and ſecure: for what contact could have been more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, or leſs apt, to wound the tender membrane of the lungs, than the air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in the breſt about them? Nor need any doubt, but that the air, thus compreſt and ſtreightned, is of ſtrength ſufficient for this ſervice: and that there is ſuch a Spring in the air; who, ſhall but conſider with what force, the air breaks forth of the Wind-gun, and other Pneumatic Engines. A farther confirmation hereof, may be had from hence: that ſuch wounds, as perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the breſt, if left open, but for a little time, do quickly cauſe a difficulty of breathing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I do not much queſtion, but if both ſides of the breſt were perforated, it would as certainly diſpatch a man, as hanging; and that, almoſt, in as ſhort a time. Farther, in the diſſection of live Animals, Reſpiration continues, long after the Abdomen or belly is laid open; but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41619:29"/>
immediately ceaſes, upon dividing the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragme or Midriff.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether the air, that enters into the lungs, by the Wind-pipe, have a ſhare in this compreſſion of them, for the diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the blood, or not, I am as yet not well ſatisfied. At firſt view, this compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould ſeem, to be beſt made upon drawing in our breath; between the air implanted in the cavity of the breſt, and the air, in the rough Arteries: (or bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Wind-pipe) but at ſuch time, the implanted air, is but little or not at all contracted: and therefore we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that either the air taken in, bears no part in this compreſſion: or which is moſt probable, that the ſanguine Veſſels of the lungs, are not only ſtrongly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, upon expirations; but alſo upon inſpiration; that is, ſo often, as the lungs are removed from their natural, middle, or indifferent ſcituation: whether expanded or contracted. Viz. <hi>Tàm in quiete externâ, quàm internâ.</hi> We muſt likewiſe allow the air to cool the lungs very conſiderably, and that it diſcharges them of a fuliginous, or rather vaporous excrement. But theſe are,

As for the airs becoming the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Vital Spirits in Reſpiration, I ſhall ſay no more, than that I neither find any need of it, nor any may for the mingling of it, with the Maſs of blood.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41619:30"/>
ſad thoughts, and a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick conſtitution; do often become the cauſe of frequent ſighing: As alſo, a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſloth, or leſs aptneſs in the lungs themſelves, or Diaphragme, to motion: will ſometimes make this paſſion cuſtomary, and habitual. And it is obſervable, that the pulſe riſes very much upon ſighing; for the firſt ſtroak, or two, at leaſt: the blood coming to the Artery again, in that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that a man may feel the tingling of it, at his very fingers ends.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Furthermore, it may not a little ſtrengthen our Aſſertion, that in all great difficulties of breathing: and where there is moſt imminent danger of ſuffocation, to let blood in good quantity, is commonly preſcribed, as the laſt remedy: and which ſeldome fails, of giving, at leaſt, a preſent relief, let the cauſe be what it may be. And this it ſeems to do, by diverting the courſe of blood from the lungs; while they gently again diſcharge themſelves of their burden. And in caſe of hanging, or ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, letting of blood in great quantity, has ſometimes ſaved mens lives that have been executed; and this by no other ways, that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41619:31"/>
I can think of, than by helping to diſcharge the lungs of their oppreſſion, as has been already ſaid.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And thus we have, if our Opinion fail us not, diſcovered the true uſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. We have, alſo of conſequence, freed the heart, of almoſt one half of the task impoſed on it, by the modern Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For ſince the circulation of the blood conſiſts of two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying it from the heart, or center, to the reſt of the body, as to a kind of natural circumference. And ſecondly, the return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or bringing back of the blood again, to the heart. The firſt part, we conceive to be the Office of the heart. The ſecond part, ſeems to be the work of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular member, to diſcharge it ſelf of its own ſuperfluities: For which purpoſe, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath endued them with a tone, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical motion, ſufficient for that ſervice, the lungs only excepted, wherein Nature hath worthily imployed her induſtry, by the additional contrivance of Reſpiration, through the aſſiſtance of the Diaphragme: which labour of the lungs, in Reſpiration, for the returning of the blood to the left
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41619:31"/>
Ventricle of the heart; ſeems to equal that of the tone, or tonical motion, of all the other parts of the body; for the lungs convey the ſame quantity, with all the reſt: that is to ſay, the whole Maſs of blood, through them; and that in as little time, as the ſame paſſes through the reſt of the body. And, if it carries it not ſo far, it moves <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t ſo much the faſter. And ſo, we ſhall have entitled the lungs, to one full quarter part, of this work of the circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the blood, leaving an other quarter to the tonical motion of the body: And the firſt, and worthier half, of diſpenſing blood and life through the whole body, to the heart, as its proper office and duty. What part, the lungs may juſtly claim to themſelves, in the buſineſs of Sanguificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhall more conveniently find place to conſider of, in the following Chapter.</p>

            <p>
               <note n="inter">N. 1.</note>THe Chyle, when ſeparated from the remaining unprofitable parts of our Aliment is, by proper veſſels of its own (the diſcovery of modern Anatomiſts) conveyed directly into the Subclavial veins, and from thence into the right Ventricle of the heart, where it is mingled with a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger quantity of blood, returning home by the great vein, together with which it is immediately tranſmitted to the lungs, where (though it make great haſt through, and moves very impetuouſly, as has been ſaid, yet) by reaſon of the length of the way, it continues a conſiderable time, and is more perfectly mingled with the blood, and wrought up together with it, into one Maſs, and at the ſame time, acquires both the name and form of blood (as Phyſitians term it) and ſo is fitted for the heart, from thence to be diſtributed to the reſt of the body: where after what manner it is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41619:32"/>
we ſay not, as a thing already ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known, and whereof we have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered our ſenſe already.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Chyle is very eaſily mixt with blood, is evident, for that it is the matter whereof all blood is made, by a farther continuation, of that fermentation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, begun on it in the ſtomack. Nor yet is the proportion ſo great between them, but that upon mingling; the diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of parts, becomes immediately the cauſe of an extraordinary ebullition: which is very much encreaſed by the reciprocal motion of the lungs, whereby the blood is wrought almoſt all into a froth or foam, by that time it gets into the left Ventricle of the heart. Which ſudden exceſs of heat, is not unlike what happens upon the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling ſeveral Chymical liquors together, as Spirit of Wine, and Spirit of Turpentine, and other ſuch like, where the heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo great, that it often endangers the veſſel they are contained in. And this is the cauſe of that heat a while after meals diſcernable in Hectical perſons, and others, otherwiſe affected: and which in many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, by fluſhings in the face. Now that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41619:33"/>
the blood is wrought up to that froth, we ſpeak of, during its paſſage through the lungs, is not only ſuitable to reaſon, but appears moſt evidently, in thoſe ſanguine excretions from the lungs, which happen in conſumptive perſons: nor does that frothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then obſervable, proceed from the mingling with it the air we breath, for that at one breathing out (or expiration) could not be ſufficiently performed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The blood, by ſeveral very learned men, has not unaptly been compared to wine; and in my Opinion, the Chyle may as properly be likened to the juice, newly preſſed out of the Grapes: which if it were by certain intervals, in a due proportion, poured gently into new wine, or muſt, as it begins to cool, would again renew its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition, and continue the warmth of it, to what degree is requiſite, and that ſo long as this practiſe ſhall be continued. And from this Illuſtration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be clearly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd; the neceſſity and uſe of eating, at leaſt within certain periods, or intervals: to wit, that by the frequent affuſion of Chyle, the blood may again recover its motion, warmth and vigour, without which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41619:33"/>
ſupply, it would ſoon languiſh, cool and congeal, and conſequently, death enſue. Now that the lungs are indeed the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal <hi>Officina Sanguinis,</hi> may be farther colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from Conſumptions of the lungs, wherein all parts of the body are ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extenuated, by the affection of the part.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis probable, that the blood during its ſtay in the lungs, does not actually dilate it ſelf, and riſe into froth, but only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an aptneſs ſo to do, as ſoon as it is at a little more liberty, as appears in blood ſpit out of them; and conſequently; when it falls into the left Ventricle of the heart, it immediately dilates it ſelf with great force, in the manner of botled Beer; and in this manner does, for ought I know, in great part, become the cauſe of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole, or expanſion of the heart, which being extended, beyond its due and natural ſcituation, does again violently contract it ſelf, by a power almoſt all bodies have of reſtoring themſelves, and which we call the tone, or tonical motion. And as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in a Switch bowed down, or in a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum removed out of its place, that they return beyond the perpendicular; ſo it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41619:34"/>
fares in this motion of the heart, whereby it is again more contracted, than is natural to it, and ſo of it ſelf returns again to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand it ſelf, and is again violently diſtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as before, by the influx of more ſpumy blood from the lungs. Now though it may be objected, that the pulſe in the heart continues, many times, a long while, after it is taken out of the body; and when there is no longer any ſuch influx to be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the cauſe of it. To this I anſwer, that ſuch pulſe, is what the Phyſitians call the <hi>Myurus,</hi> or Mouſe-tail, for that its Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromes, or differences, between greateſt and leaſt expanſion, do continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſs and leſs, even as it happens in <hi>Pendulums,</hi> once removed from the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, which continue their motion for a long time, after the hand is from them that firſt ſet them awork. At leaſt this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition of the blood in the heart, ſeems not a little to contribute to the continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſtrengthening of this pulſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In contemplation of this <hi>Orgaſmus,</hi> or fury, as I may call it, in the blood iſſuing out of the lungs, and now to be diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into all parts of the body Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41619:34"/>
the Arteries with thick and double coats, the better to contain it: whereas the veins deſigned for the carrying it back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the heart, at what time the blood is very much cooled and tamed, are only made of ſingle membranes, as being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient now to hold it. And this is all the difference between Arterial and Venal blood.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It ſeems of all other Opinions the moſt probable, that the blood, when arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the extremities of the ſmalleſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, is there ſhed upon the habit of the body, in the belly, or fleſhy part of every Muſcle; each Muſcle having the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or likeneſs, of one of the quarters, or Acetabula in an Orange, or a Lemon; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the compreſſion of which, either by local or tonical motion, it is not hard to conceive, how the blood is again forced into the mouths of the veins; and after the ſame manner has every Muſcle its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular membrane. And thus we find that blood iſſues forth, upon pricking the fleſh, in any place; although it cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we ſhould always prick a vein or Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: or we muſt conclude, there is nothing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41619:35"/>
elſe in fleſh, but a multitude of capillar veins and arteries, which were abſurd to be aſſerted.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To make ſhort: Life it ſelf is but a continuation of this vigorous fermentation of the blood, which is ſo long maintained, as the Maſs of blood is kept hot, and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating through the veins and arteries; and if done by thoſe means, and in that manner, which is ſuitable to Nature, ſo long the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is in perfect health. If it be too violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fermented, or moved, it does, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, become the cauſe of Fevers, and other acute diſeaſes: as contrariwiſe, if the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation be too weak, from thence all chronical diſeaſes take their original: and that particularly, according to the ſeveral irregularities that may happen, either in exceſs, or defect, in this fermentation and circular motion of the blood. We deſcend not now to particulars, the moſt we aim at in this Treatiſe, being but a general me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, either of preventing or curing diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, after a way not yet treated of.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Since the diſcovery of the circulation of the blood, it has been the Opinion of many great Aſſertous of it, that where the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41619:35"/>
indication is of letting blood, it matters not out of what vein it be taken, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo many ounces be let out, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe requires. And this their Aſſertion is made probable, by many arguments alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them for that purpoſe; and but for the tonical motion of the habit of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, would be as great a truth, as any is in Phyſick. But the tonical motion of the parts once admitted, We muſt likewiſe grant, that thoſe parts will empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves firſt, that lie neareſt to the inciſion; as well, for that there is leſs ſtrength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to force any liquor to a ſhorter than a longer diſtance: as alſo, becauſe the more remote parts, or Muſcles, do exerciſe a kind of Antipraxia, or Contranitency, and ſo become of mutual impediment one to the other: whereas the nearer parts, do almoſt immediately diſcharge themſelves upon the Orifice, or inciſion.</p>
            <p n="8">8. From this tonical motion of the whole body, it happens, that any particular part is ſometimes preternaturally ſwelled, either from a ſtroak, the application of cupping-glaſſes, or generally any other cauſe, which may weaken the tone of the part; for in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41619:36"/>
ſuch caſe, the heart continuing its motion, for the diſtribution of the Maſs of humors, it is very eaſie to conceive, that more of them will paſs into that part, where leaſt reſiſtance is made, than otherwiſe would have happened, had the part continued in its natural tone and vigour.</p>
            <p n="9">9. From hence likewiſe the reaſon is to be ſought, how it happens in letting blood, that ſo large a quantity ſhould in ſo ſmall a time, iſſue out at the inciſion made in one vein, and that perhaps none of the largeſt. For if we duly conſider, how quickly a man may bleed to death, by the opening (for inſtance) of a vein in his arm; we muſt conclude, that the blood paſſes not much faſter through the heart, than it does at the ſame time out at the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice in his arm; and that conſequently, there is but little blood received, during this evacuation, into the reſt of the body, which doth then by its tone diſcharge it ſelf (into the great vein) of its Plethora, or ſuperfluous blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from the heart, toward the habit, the greateſt part takes its way to the part, where the inciſion was made, it finding
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41619:36"/>
there no other oppoſition, than what it has while it is travaſated from the arteries into the veins, through the ſmallneſs of their mouths, which yet is in part recompenced by the multitude of them. Now if it be agreed on, that in half an hour a man may bleed to death, or thereabout, if a vein in the arm be kept open: and that there will, in ſuch caſe, be about one half of his blood let out, computing what is likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the capillar veſſels, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the habit of the body, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, either that the whole Maſs is compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circulated twenty four times in twenty four hours, or a natural day. Which ſeems a little too often, or that the blood circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates much faſter, while a vein is breathing, than at other times, which is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; or that a man may continue bleeding longer than half an hour, which is not ſo likely: or that there is not in ſuch caſe of bleeding to death, one full half of the Maſs let out: All which may deſerve a more exact ſcrutiny, but muſt now be left to be decided by the experiments of ſuch, as are converſant in the diſſection of live Animals.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:41619:37"/>10. It is frequently ſeen in horſes, that upon long and much labour, they loſe the ſight of their eyes; nay, I have known ſome horſes that have loſt one or both eyes, with one days over-ſtraining, either by draught, or courſe, and ſo became blinde of a ſudden. And then we commonly ſay, they have drawn their eyes out: But how the eyes ſhould ſuffer, or what part they take in the labour, or violent exerciſe of the body, is not ſo eaſily made out, unleſs by this tonical motion of the body, which now becomes much ſtrengthened by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent local motion, either in drawing, or running, whereby the Muſcles of the whole body are much more compreſſed, than in their natural ſtate of reſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, do not only not admit of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual quantity of blood and humours, due to them by circulation; but by their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and frequent contraction, do return them back in much a larger proportion, than they now receive them; whereupon the lungs become over-charged, which cauſes frequent breathing, and makes the pulſe quicker and ſtronger than formerly, diſtends the great vein and artery, with a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41619:37"/>
greater quantity of blood, than is uſuall: Whereupon the Artery, by its pulſe, and tone endeavours to diſcharge it ſelf upon the habit of the body, which not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it in its due and accuſtomed proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the blood does in a more than a uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner, fill the veſſels of the eyes (and other weak parts) and either by diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, compreſſion, or extravaſation of blood, or other humor, the order and diſpoſition of the parts of the eyes becomes ſo confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and diſturbed, that no wonder if blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs immediately, or ſoon after, do enſue. Now 'tis manifeſt from hence, that where the body of an horſe is clean, that is to ſay, not ſo full of humors; and where blood abounds not over-much, this accident ſhall not eaſily happen. And here we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that though the native tone of the eye do rather exceed that of the other parts, than come ſhort of it, yet it is not ſufficient to reſiſt this influx, when the tone of the other parts is ſo much ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by the violent local motions of the body.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If we a little reflect upon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Circulation of the Blood, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41619:38"/>
how by very modern diſcovery, the Chyle is firſt mingled with the blood, in the axil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary or ſubclavial veins, from whence it paſſes by the right Ventricle of the heart, through the lungs, into the left Ventricle; from thence to be diſtributed into the whole body: One thing very remarkable will ariſe to our obſervation; namely, that what part of the blood is ſent toward the head by the carotides or arteries of the neck, flows thither very crude, and accompanied with all its excrements, it having not yet received or ſuffered any depuration, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, from the Reins or Spleen, like that which paſſes into almoſt all other, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the lower parts of the body (though indeed it ſeems not to be cleanſed of the gall, till it returns home again through the liver.) Now though Natures purpoſe herein be very obſcure, that the blood thus impure, ſhould be deſigned for the ſervice of the moſt Noble part, yet, that ſo it is, will farther appear, by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Emunctories (or ſinks) wherewith the head is in a particular manner provided, as the ears, eyes, noſe, palat; every of which, diſcharge the brain of a ſeveral excrement,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41619:38"/>
and that no longer uſeful to the body, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what is ſecerned by the palat, which is for the moſt part again returned to the ſtomack: for the better ſeparating of which, Nature has induſtriouſly placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the head, ſo many of thoſe ſerous veſſels, called the <hi>Ductus Salivares,</hi> which ſeem here to perform the ſame Office, to that part of the blood ſent to the head, which the Reins do execute, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Maſs. Hence no wonder it is; if exceſſive drinking do ſo much weaken the brain, cauſe Catarrhs (which is nothing but an over-flowing of the <hi>Ductus Salivares</hi>) weaken all the faculties of the Soul and ſenſes, and at length, enervate the whole body, although, at the ſame time, the Reins do their duty indifferently well; and this eſpecially, if the native tone of the brain be weak, it being then ſo much the leſs able to diſcharge it ſelf of ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous excrements. This may be ſaid in general, that the blood is thus ſent to the brain, before depuration, in regard of its publick Office, that the ſame may there be farther elaborated, as ſhall beſt ſuit with its ſervice in that Noble part. Thus
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41619:39"/>
much, by way of an uſeful digreſſion, may ſuffice, concerning tonical motion, and ſome conſiderable circumſtances of it; which as well for the aſſiſtance it gives the heart, in the circulation of the blood, as for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny uſeful indications from thence ariſing, in the Doctrine of Phlebotomy, was moſt properly to be handled in this Chapter of Sanguification.</p>
            <p n="12">12. And now I do not much doubt, but whoever ſhall have carefully peruſed what has been lately ſaid concerning Sanguifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the uſe of the lungs; will as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily conclude with me, that the lungs do bear a very principal part in the work of Sanguification, for in them the Chyle is perfectly mingled with the blood; in them one half part of the circulation is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and in them the blood ſeems to free it ſelf, firſt of all, from any excrement: to wit, a fuliginous, or rather a vaporous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſuperfluity (which paſſeth out together with our breath.) And this ſeems the firſt and chiefeſt part of Sanguification. The ſecond, is a farther elaborating the Maſs of blood in the arteries, which is performed by the pulſive motion of the heart. The
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41619:39"/>
third and laſt part, is the depuration of the blood, whereby its ſuperfluous excrements are ſeparated from it: and this is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the reſt of the bowels thus: by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the Reins, it is dreined of its ſerous parts: Another excrement it ſeems to leave behind it in the Spleen, though of what kind, is not yet well determined among the modern Phyſitians: But on all ſides it is concluded, that while it paſſe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Having far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made it probable, that the work of our ſtomacks, upon our Aliments, as alſo,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41619:40"/>
that Sanguification it ſelf, is a kind of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. And laſtly, having aſſerted the publick Office of the lungs, together with the uſe of breathing, as well in promoting the circulation, as elaborating of the blood. And having likewiſe ſaid ſomething of the tonical motion of the body; and all this, after a manner, ſomewhat different from what has been hitherto received, and taught in the Schools. It remains, that from theſe Phyſiological ſpeculations, we proceed to raiſe ſome medicinal concluſions and contrivances, very uſeful for the cure, as well as prevention of ſundry diſeaſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But firſt it will be neceſſary, to premiſe, that the Atmoſphere, wherein we breath and live, is heavy or ponderous, and preſſes more or leſs, upon all bodies in it; and upon all ſides expoſed to it; and that eſpecially, according to its difference of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and denſity. So that upon the tops of very high hills, and in bright weather, the Atmoſphere will lie lighter upon us; and all other bodies than the ſame, will in thick weather, and in deep valleys; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that we move with more difficulty when the air is thick, and with more eaſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41619:41"/>
when the ſame is thinner; which is as much as to ſay, that the reſiſtance of the Medium is proportionable to its meaſure of rarity and denſity. All which we now take for granted, and ſhall ſpare our ſelves the pains of proving, as what has been already ſufficiently made out by ſeveral learned men in this our Age: from whoſe writings ſuch as doubt, may receive very ample ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And we ſhall only conclude, that if all motion, be eaſieſt performed in the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt air, then in ſuch an air, we ſhall breath freer, digeſt our meat better, and be leſs tired with wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>king, or working, than in a thicker air: and conſequently, perform all the functions of life better, as is indeed manifeſt, even to experience it ſelf. (which yet is wont, for the moſt part, to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice but of the more groſs obſervables) for who almoſt is there, of ſo happy a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that during health it ſelf, and in the prime of his years, is not in ſome meaſure affected by the alteration of the weather, and by the change of the air? for, as for ſuch as are ſick, the very moments of life and death, do ſeem to depend upon this change: and ſuch as are Valetudinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41619:41"/>
commonly find, to their great grief, that their own bodies, may indifferently well ſupply the want of a weather-glaſs, in admoniſhing them, not only of the changes of the weather, but of the ſeaſons of the year alſo. So very conſiderable is this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the air to all mixed bodies, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Animals, and among them, to men more particularly, as being leſs armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the injuries of the air, and among men moſt of all, to ſuch as are infirm; as hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now if the Natural and Vital Functions are better and eaſier performed in a purer air, than in a courſer; no wonder, if upon changing the worſe for the better air, many (eſpecially Chronical) diſeaſes, do by degrees from thence, receive a cure: which were before invincible, by other remedies: or muſt have been patiently endured, till the alteration of the ſeaſon of the year, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that change in the air, (as to its tone and temper) which is ſufficient ſo to rectifie the motion of the humours in our bodies, as at length to overcome the diſtemper. Which might poſſibly have ſooner been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by a ſeaſonable removal into a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41619:42"/>
warmer, or drier Region. But it is much more remarkable, that not only the changing a bad air for a better, is available in ſuch caſes; but much more the often changing of the air, though ſometime for a worſe, which is not only confirmed by experience, but likewiſe by the Authority of <hi>C. Celſus,</hi> who ſtrictly injoyns it, and adds this as a reaſon, that if a man reſide in ſo good an air, that he knows not where to remove to a better, yet it will be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to remove, and that often; for in caſe of ſickneſs, that may juſtly be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the worſt air, as to the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Patient, in which the diſeaſe took its beginning. The reaſon (in groſs) why changing the air at all, ſhould cure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, may be this; that the body of man is capable of enduring a greater latitude, either in the tone or temper of the air, than what the diſeaſe thus curable can conſiſt with; and perhaps no other Animal is able to endure that variety of Climes, that a man may indifferently enjoy himſelf in. And thus men are found to inhabit in all parts almoſt of the Inhabitable World, whereas other Animals are proper to this or that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41619:42"/>
particular Region, and will either die, if tranſported into other places, or at leaſt loſe much of their vigour, and not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. The ſame is alſo obſervable in plants. 'Tis ſaid, that Lice bred on this ſide the Line, (or Aequator) will immediately all die on the other ſide the Line: So that it follows, the Ptheraſis, or Lowſie diſeaſe, will be ſpeedily cured by ſuch a change of the air or Clime: and all, or moſt other diſeaſes, do ſeem to bear ſome Analogy in their exiſtence, to the life of that deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble little Animal. But that the often chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the air, is ſo much a Nobler Remedy, than that of removing once for all into the beſt air: The reaſon is ſurely this, that firſt, in the finer air, the motion of Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the humors, and juices of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, is better performed, and ſomewhat accelerated; and again, a little retarded, by a ſpeedy remove into a groſſer air, whereby the humors are, as it were, knead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or carded; and the diſeaſe at every ſuch change, receives a notable ſhake, which ſeems to be much more ſenſible (if I may ſo ſay) of every ſuch impreſſion, than our bodies are. And this often changing the air,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41619:43"/>
does well reſemble the many ſtroaks, which are neceſſary to fall the ſturdier Oak, while one or two, though very conſiderable ones, are not ſufficient to bring him to the ground. I ſhould therefore from hence conclude, that if once changing the air, do not in ſome reaſonable time give aſſurance of a cure, that then we doubt not, with the Judicious <hi>Celſus,</hi> to change, as often as ſhall ſeem convenient, which ſurely will, (other helps not neglected) at length (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the diſeaſe be curable) put an end to, and wholly eradicate the diſtemper, be it almoſt what it may be.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But it will not be amiſs, to be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more particular, in ſhewing, after what manner the air works upon our bodies, and affects it with its ſeveral alterations, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of rarity or denſity. And firſt, I think it wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l be granted by moſt men, and might be clearly proved by ſeveral experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that there is a certain quantity of air in all liquors, inſenſibly diſperſed in very minute parts, through the whole Maſs of them, which ſmall particles do actually ſymbolize with the Medium; and will, by contracting or dilating themſelves, cauſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41619:43"/>
the liquor wherein they reſide, to take up ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs room: as will be manifeſt to him, that ſhall fill a large glaſs bottle, of about a pottle or more, with water, till it riſe two or three inches in the neck, which will need to be very ſlender, and ſomewhat long, and it will ſoon appear, that the water ſhall ſometimes riſe, and at other times fall, almoſt after the manner of ordinary Weather-glaſſes: as will be much more manifeſt, if it be for a while ſet neer the fire, ſo as to be a little warmed by it. Now the humors and jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our bodies, have likewiſe the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proportion of air in them, and that in a far greater meaſure, than common wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which ſeems of all other liquors to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the leaſt (as is probable from the ſmall inclination it has to be fermented) and therefore it ſeems to follow, that upon all changes in the Air, or Medium, the juices of our bodies are affected: (even after the ſame manner, as has been ſaid of common water) and that according to the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Weather, of day and night, and of the ſeaſons of the year. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, or changes, in any one particular
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41619:44"/>
place, have a kind of orderly method of ſucceeding one another, but much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of another place or Region, which, though it have the like alterations of Weather, Seaſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the order or method of this variety, is as it were, of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Scale from that of the former. And the differences of heat and cold, denſity and rarity in the Medium, are either greater or ſmaller, than thoſe of the former: whereby the body removed from the place of its former aboad, to another, is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the varieties aforeſaid, after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner than what was uſual to it. Whereby the face (if I may ſo ſay) or complexion of the humors and juices in the body, will be much altered and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from what it lately was: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Morboſe Character very much defaced, if not wholly obliterated. Which effect will in all probability more certainly ſucceed upon often, than upon once change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the air, as has been already ſufficiently evinced, both from reaſon and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Of all changes of the air, that is commonly obſerved to be moſt effectual, for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41619:44"/>
the cure of any diſtemper gotten abroad; which is made by removal from a forreign Country, to a mans own Native Soil, or the place of his birth, and firſt abode: which ſeems to be true <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> from hence, that the Aerious Particles, which originally go, as one principal ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the making up of the body, were at firſt of the ſame tone exactly with that of the Medium: and it cannot be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that upon any conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, theſe Aery Particles muſt be more or leſs dilated, or contracted, than they formerly were, whereby the body will be preternaturally affected. Which though during the ſtate of health, it be not cauſe ſufficient, perhaps, to manifeſtly hinder any action of the body; yet in caſe of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, it ſeems to be a notable relief to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be reſtored again to its Native con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution (as far as is poſſible) which is a kind of renewing, and no ſmall refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the body: from whence a Patient ſeldome fails of a relief, and very often finds a perfect cure, in ſeveral contumacious diſeaſes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I would not be ſo far miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41619:45"/>
as if I aſſerted the alterations our bodies ſuffer from the Medium, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame, in degree, with thoſe of the Weather-glaſs; for that I think were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſtent with perfect health, as we find theſe alterations in moſt perſons are: though in infirm bodies they are very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. But I ſuppoſe, by this time, it may be expected from me, that I give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this difference, and ſay how it comes to paſs, that the air in our bodies is not affected by the Medium exactly, after the manner of the Weather-glaſs, but in a leſs degree, where for the only reaſon I can think of, I ſhall aſſign the tone or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical motion of every body ſo often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; which being compreſſive of all the parts of our bodies, it very conſiderably checks and hinders that dilation of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, by means of the rarified air, which would otherwiſe enſue upon the like affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Medium: which compreſſion, or reſiſtance of the tone, or tonical motion of the body, may be very well illuſtrated from a bottle full of (nothing but) air, well ſtopt, and afterward expoſed to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of heat and cold. In which caſe, it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41619:45"/>
cannot be imagined, that the included air, is at all either dilated, or contracted: not the firſt, becauſe there is no room for it to expand it ſelf upon, nor yet the laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſides of the Bottle are not apt to ſubſide, without which, no ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given, why the air, upon exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cold, ſhould quit any part of the place it formerly repleniſhed. And yet in ſome caſes, the differences of heat and cold may be ſo great, as to prevail over the ſtrength of an ordinary bottle, and break it, as has been often found by experience. But here we muſt obſerve, that though the ſides of the bottle give no way at all to the air included, yet the tonical power of the body doth ſomewhat yield to ſuch alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the humors; and that more or leſs, according to its different ſtrength in the body, of this or that individual. Nor doth this experiment of the Bottle ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently conclude, but that, at leaſt, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the air in our bodies, ought to anſwer that of the Medium: and indeed, that it doth not, ſeems to proceed from the internal heat in the humors of Animals, (maintained, as is ſaid in the Chapter of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41619:46"/>
Sanguification) which is of power ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, not only to reſiſt the compreſſion of the tone, or tonical motion of the habit of the body, but that of the medium alſo. And ſhould the contrary happen, death would inevitably enſue.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It may be farther noted, that all bodies (whether men, or other Animals) are not equally affected with the ſame change or alteration in the Medium; but, as hath been ſaid, proportionably to the ſtrength of the tonical power of each bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And thus it happens, that a perſon of a Robuſt Conſtitution, and habit of body, (whether ſuch naturally, or acquired by much travel and labour) will with leſs trouble and hazard of his health, endure any notable alteration, or change of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Soil, than another of a finer Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and compoſure; and whoſe tone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is not ſo reſiſtive of the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from without, as that of the former. And thus it is eaſie to conceive, why a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon inhabiting neer either of the Poles of the Earth, and removed to, or neer the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator: or the contrariwiſe, will find the temper of that Clime more troubleſome
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41619:46"/>
and offenſive to his health, than he ſhall, that from the middle temperate Region, ſhall transfer himſelf to either of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes. And no doubt, the leſs the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, the eaſier and ſooner ſhall a mans Nature be brought to comply with it. And thus we obſerve, that <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gezes,</hi> do with leſs danger, travel and trade into the more Southern Regions of the world, than Northern men can do, who are commonly not otherwiſe ſeaſoned, than by ſome dangerous Calenture, Flux or Spaſm, or other deplorable diſeaſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much, the greater part of them, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deſtroyed. All which diſeaſes are no other, than the effects the Medium hath upon the Air impriſoned in our bodies; which if it finds the humors eaſily diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a farther degree of fermentation, than what is conſiſtent with health, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a Fever or Calenture in ſome bodies; in others, a dangerous Flux: and in ſome moſt violent Spaſmes, upon the forcible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation either of the Air in the nervous parts, or of that, which may poſſibly be, in the ſpaces between the Muſcles.</p>
            <p n="8">8. From hence probably it is, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41619:47"/>
the fruits of thoſe hotter Countryes are ſo dangerous, eſpecially to ſtrangers; for that they are no ſooner received into the body, but they are ſtraightways very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently fermented (and after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ferment the juices of the body, to the diſordering of the whole frame) in ſo much, that the juice of ſome plants, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a deadly poyſon, as that of the Root of <hi>Yucca</hi> (while the ſolider parts are made into a kind of wholeſome bread) and poſſibly, for no other venomous quality, than its over-active fermentation, whereby it not only diſturbs, but deſtroys the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of the body. All which, and much more of this kind, that might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ſeems in great part to depend upon the fineneſs, or rarity of the Medium, which lying lighter on liquors, and other bodies thus fermented, ſuffers them more eaſily, and more violently, to expand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than, for the moſt part, is ſuitable with the health of ſuch as eat them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in any conſiderable quantity.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And now from what hath hitherto been ſaid, it may ſeem exceeding probable, that the Air doth conſiderably alter, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41619:47"/>
diſpoſe the humors of our bodies, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon changing one Clime for another; and that our bodies do, more or leſs, ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with the preſent tone and temper of the Medium; whereby it is not only freed from ſeveral diſtempers, but may alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often be thereby variouſly diſaffected, and caſt into divers dangerous diſeaſes. But yet, how uſeful ſoever the changing of the Air may be, for the cure of any infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: we find it ſtands with the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but of very few, to make ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movals; for that they cannot well diſpenſe, with the leaving their Families or Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, together with other their familiar af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, or imployments. Beſides, Phyſitians are not apt to adviſe their Patients to it, till they have firſt, in vain, imployed moſt other remedies in the cure of them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by commonly the oportunity is loſt, and the ſick perſon deprived of that benefit he might, in all probability, have received, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a more ſeaſonable removal. Beſides, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, it would be neceſſary, not only to remove to ſome neighbouring place, or other, but even to take a journey of ſome hundreds of miles, which cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41619:48"/>
by the ſick, but with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. So that what through one impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or other, the thing happens to be but rarely put in practiſe; and ſo Noble a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, is not only neglected, but in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner brought into diſeſteem with ſome, for want of more frequent examples of the great uſe of it; while they cannot give themſelves a ſatisfactory account, how ſuch a change of the Air ſhould ſo conſiderably work upon our bodies.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Now to the end we may not want the help of ſo generous a remedy; and for the better avoiding the fore-mentioned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences in the uſe of it. I hold it a matter of no ſmall compendium, in this place, briefly to ſet down, and ſhew the manner of a certain contrivance, how any perſon may receive the benefit he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, upon removal from his abode, to any other place (with intent to change the air) and that almoſt indifferently at any ſeaſon of the year, without ſo much as remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out of his own houſe, or neglecting any occaſions whatſoever. Firſt therefore, in ſome fit place neer, or adjoyning to your houſe, erect a convenient Room, of about
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41619:48"/>
ſome twelve or fourteen foot ſquare, or of what ſize you pleaſe, either bigger or ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler than the former, and let it be exactly well cieled, or vaulted over head, and well paved; or otherwiſe ſo floared at bottom, that the air may not have any vent, to get either out, or in, nor yet through the walls, which it is requiſite ſhould be of brick or ſtone, and well plaiſter'd on the inſide; and let the windows be likewiſe ſo contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that no air may paſs in or out that way, which the eaſier to prevent, and that they may be alſo the ſtronger, and leſs apt to crack, they ought not to be very big, nor many. The door muſt be likewiſe ſo contrived, that it may ſhut into its frame ſo exactly, that when it is made faſt, there may not be the leaſt paſſage left for the air to get in or out of the foreſaid Chamber. The particular manner and contrivance of doing all which, I do not here ſet down, for that I doubt not, but there are ingenious Maſons and Joyners, that will much exceed any directions, that I can be able to give them. Your Air-Chamber being thus made, you muſt farther provide your ſelf with a very large pair of Organ Bellows, which
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41619:49"/>
muſt be placed in ſome convenient part of the Room, where by the help of a Skrew, the Noſe of them may be exactly joyned to a Copper Pipe, whoſe other end muſt paſs through the wall of the Room, and have a value, opening outward, exactly fitted to it, as is uſual in Water Engines: and if the ſaid Value be placed in water, it will do much better. This Brazen Pipe muſt likewiſe have another Value to open inward, and both ſo contrived, that either of them may be ſet open at any time, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, while the other is imployed. The Bellows being thus fitted, and the door and windows cloſe ſhut, you may at pleaſure either fill the Chamber with Air, by force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what quantity you pleaſe, till there be twice or thrice as much as there was at firſt, ti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l the ſame be as thick as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. You may likewiſe diſcharge the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of one third, one half, or more of the air it had at firſt in it, till you have on the contrary, brought what remains, to that degree of Tenuity (or thinneſs) is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and this by the help of the Bellows; which if the air be to be forced out, muſt lie with their moveable part upwards; and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41619:49"/>
the innermoſt Value of the Brazen Pipe, before mentioned, muſt either be taken off, or kept conſtantly open: but if air is to be forced into the Chamber, then the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows will need to be turned the wrong ſide upward; and the outward Value of the Braſs Pipe muſt be taken off, or kept o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and the innermoſt Value ſuffered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to play. In which caſes, working gently with the Bellows, you may either charge, or diſcharge (as I may ſay) the Air-Chamber at your pleaſure, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, obtain an Air in it, of what rarity or denſity you pleaſe. The meaſure of which variety, that you may the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly take an account of (and that there may be very little or no miſtake in the uſe of this Chamber) it will be abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to have conſtantly with you, a large Weather-glaſs: And you may likewiſe have a Tub of glaſs, of ſome forty inches long, filled with Quick-ſilver, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a little Earthen or Wooden Veſſel, half filled, with a quantity of the ſame material, after the manner of the Torricellian experiment; and theſe are to ſerve you for Regiſters: for by the aſcent,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41619:50"/>
and deſcent of the Water, in the Weather-glaſs, will be noted to you, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, on the neck of the Glaſs, in what prop<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtion you have either rarified or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed the Air within the Room: and you may by help of it, rectifie the tone of the Air, to what degree is requiſite, or injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The uſe of the Quick ſilver Tub, is the very ſame, but will not give ſo exact an account, of every ſmall difference, as the former, by reaſon of the ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Air contained in it: but yet will not want its uſe in other experiments, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Phyſick, which I ſhall not here touch upon, as too remote from what we here handle. Such therefore, as imploy this contrivance, only in Relation to their Health, may content themſelves with a Weather-glaſs, which will prove much an exacter Regiſter, than the Quick-ſilver Tub, as hath been already ſhewed.</p>
            <p n="11">11. As to the particular application of the uſe of the newly deſcribed Domici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium, or Air-Chamber, 'twill not be amiſs to repeat, what we before aſſerted in the precedent Chapter; namely, that as health it ſelf, is maintained by a due and ſuitable
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41619:50"/>
fermentation of the humors in our bodies, and that within a certain latitude. So, if the irregularity of the ſaid motion, or fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, be great enough, to become the cauſe of the manifeſt abolition, or weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only, of any action of our bodies, the party ſo affected, is ſaid to be ſick, or diſeaſed: and as all diſeaſes may be divided into acute, whereto are thoſe of ſhort continuance to be referred (though they are not uſually termed Acute, taking the word more ſtrictly) and Chronical affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: or elſe (which comes to the ſame thing) they may properly enough be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into diſeaſes, participating of heat, or of cold. The former of which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready defined, to depend upon ſuch an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular fermentation of the blood, and Maſs of humors, wherein the ſame are more violently moved, than is conſiſtent with health: of which kind are all continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and intermittent Fevers, all Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, moſt Fluxes, and ſeveral other diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: and contrariwiſe, all Chronical, or cold affections, ſeem to depend upon ſuch an irregularity of the foreſaid Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the humors are not ſo ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41619:51"/>
moved, and agitated, as is requiſite to health; of which kind are the Scurvey, the Rickets, all Dropſies, ſome Fluxes, moſt affections of the Spleen, and probably the Gout, and other Arthritical diſtempers. Now the method of uſing this Domicil, or Air-Chamber, in general, will be this, that where the diſeaſe ſeems to depend upon a deficient Fermentation of the humors, in ſuch caſe, the Patient (being put into the ſaid Chamber, and the door cloſe ſhut) ſhall, by degrees, diſcharge the ſame, or force the air out; till having conſiderably alter'd the tone, and rarified what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, he ſtill finds himſelf to breath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or at leaſt with no great difficulty; at what time he may obſerve, how low the water is deſcended in his Regiſter, or Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-glaſs, which will ſhew him how far he may ſafely, at another time, diſcharge the air, without danger of Cramping; which uſes to enſue, if the air be too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly rarified. On the other ſide, if the diſeaſe be Acute, and ſeem to depend upon the too violent Fermentation of the humors, then it is neceſſary the Chamber be well charged with air, to what degree
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41619:51"/>
of Toleration ſhall ſeem convenient. And here we are principally to provide, that no difficulty of breathing enſue, which oftner happens in this practiſe of condenſed, than attenuated air. Now the term of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients continuance in the Chamber, at one time, is to be defined in Chronical diſeaſes, as well from his own occaſions, as other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; and generally two, three, or more hours, may ſeem ſufficient, and that eſpecially in the morning, when the uſe of other Remedies are found moſt conducible. But in acute diſeaſes, it ſhould ſeem neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that the Patient continued in the ſaid Chamber, during the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, and that the tone of the air be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently altered, after the directions of ſome able Phyſitians, according as the times of the diſeaſe ſhall ſeem to require; eſpecially in intermittent Fevers, where the time of the whole Paroxiſme muſt be ſpent in the Chamber, and the cold fit requires to be treated as a cold diſeaſe, with rarifying the air, as the hot fit, by condenſing it, which muſt be carefully obſerved. Now though there may be many diſeaſes, as the Stone, the French Pox, and ſome other,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41619:52"/>
which do not depend ſo immediately, upon the aforeſaid irregularities of the Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the humors; yet I ſhould not doubt, even in theſe, to commend the uſe of this Domicil, or Air-Chamber: for that while Nature is thereby much ſtrengthened in all her Natural Functions, it muſt needs follow, that ſhe will from hence, at leaſt, be enabled the better to endure the conflict with thoſe diſeaſes, if, at laſt, ſhe do not wholly get the better of them. It will farther be neceſſary here to add, that in maligne diſeaſes, and where we require an amendment of the inſenſible tranſpiration; we are, as in cold diſeaſes, to rarifie, and not condenſe the air in the Domicil, where the Indication is rather preſervative, than curative, as Phyſitians uſe to ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="12">12. To ſay ſomething of the uſe of this contrivance, in time of health, we ſhall only propoſe it, as a good expedient to help digeſtion, and eſpecially inſenſible tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and facilitate breathing and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoration; and conſequently, as of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe, for prevention of moſt affections of the lungs, where they are feared; and that generally, what ever the benefits of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41619:52"/>
changing the air, are, may be reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the uſe of this Domicil; and that after a more certain regular way, than without it, for that by the means of it, a perſon may ſerve himſelf with ſuch air, as were not otherwiſe to be found, but on the top of the Pike of Teneriff, or ſome other very high Mountain: nay, if it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, as perhaps it may in ſome very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious affections, he may rarifie the air to a far higher degree, and make it ſuch, as is not again to be found upon the face of the whole inhabitable world. But as well in ſickneſs, as in health, thoſe great exceſſes are not to be ventured upon, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. The uſe of this Domicil may be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extended, for preventing the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience which may enſue, upon any great change of air, by travelling into forreign Countryes; whereby a perſon may at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure reduce the tone of the air, to that of his own Soil or Climate: and probably, if the ſame might be made uſe of aboard Ships, it would (with the additional contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of a Chair, or Bed, hung after the manner of a Sea-Compaſs) prevent that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41619:53"/>
very trouble affection whereto freſh men are ſo ſubject, called Sea-ſickneſs; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, become very ſerviceable to ſuch, whoſe imployments ingage them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take Voyages into very remote parts, and there to reſide, far from their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes. There may, I doubt not, ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſiderable concluſions be performed, by means of this contrivance: As alſo, that the thing it ſelf is very capable of good improvement, as to the projection of it, far beyond that deſcribed by us. All which, together with what hath been already ſaid, and undertaken by us, on the behalf of it. We leave for farther diſcovery, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, to practiſe and experience.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Among the improvements which this contrivance of an Air-chamber is probably capable of, it is in my judgement none of the leaſt that may be obtained, by joyning the practiſe of S. <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> in his <hi>Medicina Statica,</hi> to this of ours. For as the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tranſpiration by the habit of the body (than which, nothing conduces more to the preſervation of health, and prevention of diſeaſes) is one of the moſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41619:53"/>
conſiderable among thoſe many benefits we promiſe our ſelves by it: So, if we ſhall have, as <hi>Sanctorius</hi> directs, a <hi>Statera Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> in our Air-chamber, it will be of very great conſequence, for aſcertaining the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical uſe of it, whereby it will become leſs ſubject to gueſs or hazard. For as the Weather-glaſs, before-mentioned, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to us, the degrees of rarity and den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, introduced in the incloſed air: So the Balance, will with the ſame exactneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, at what rate this <hi>Diaphoretical</hi> tranſpiration, is either improved or abated: and at the ſame time give us the true weight (in Ounces and Drachmes) of thoſe inſenſible <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which continually paſs that way. For the Patient, weighing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (for inſtance) firſt at ſeven of the clock in the morning, and again at nine or ten (having firſt exonerated himſelf) and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from meat and drink, in the mean time; ſhall thereby perceive how much (by weight) of his aliment, or rather of the unprofitable part thereof, in thoſe two or three hours, paſſed inſenſibly through the pores of his body. Let him again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the ſame experiment, the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41619:54"/>
with the ſame circumſtances, in the Air-chamber: and he will not be a little ſurprized, to find half ſo much more, and perhaps, twice the quantity evacuated, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame inſenſible manner (or <hi>è contra</hi>) and that in ſuch proportion, as he ſhall have ſuffered more, or leſs, of the included air, to have paſſed into the circumſtant Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, (or <hi>è contra</hi>) of what proportion the Weather-glaſs, as a faithful Regiſter, ſhall give him a very particular account. I will not farther inlarge, upon this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional practiſe, of the Scale or Balance: much leſs add any thing of the uſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Tranſpiration, leaſt I might offend ſuch, as are better verſed in Statical Experiments; by the unprofitable repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of what they are already ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: or by giving an ill account of a book I have but once read over, and that neer twenty years ſince, deprive others of that ſolid benefit they may receive, by peruſal of the above-commended Treatiſe of <hi>Sanctorius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. As this contrivance of the air-chamber, is beſt fitted for the improvement of health, and the aboliſhing ſuch Morboſe Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,

as depend upon the over-ſlow, or too nimble fermentation of the Humors. So it were eaſie to project, great Veſſels, after the manner of Cupping-glaſſes, ſome capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive the whole Thighs, others fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Arms: whereby we may at pleaſure, (as the ſeat of ſome particular diſeaſes ſhall direct) make ſuch powerful revulſions, as ſhall not only be ſufficient, to charm, as it were, and diſpoſe of ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, as Phyſitians call <hi>Turgid,</hi> and <hi>Motu Peccantes:</hi> but even diſcharge particular parts of ſuch humors, as have ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there already; and may, beſides that of Cupping-glaſſes, very fitly ſupply the place of the ſtrongeſt Ligatures. Which practiſe, as it may be very available, in moſt affections of the head: In inflammations, or other tumors or charges, of particular parts: So (not having yet had ſufficient op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to confirm this my Opinion, by the frequent uſe of it) I ſhall content my ſelf at preſent with having done little more, than named it only.</p>

be ſupplied by a long-ſetting Swing, which is found to be a very agreeable exerciſe, by moſt people that have uſed it: if their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have not been very impure, or firſt duly prepared. And by it many perſons, affected with Chronical diſtempers, taking their original from a deficient fermentation, have found benefit. For, motion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſo much (as has been ſaid) to the exciting of all fermentation, (which is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Syrups, and other juices of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſhaken, and as a proof of it, that Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee Wine, is accounted the beſt, that upon ſhaking bubbles and works moſt) no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the ſeaſonable continuance of this moderate, reciprocal motion of the Swing, do by degrees, (though not ſo ſuddenly as in the fore-mentioned inſtances of Syrups, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe the humors in our bodies lie not ſo looſely as they, in Veſſels of glaſs or ſtone) produce the ſame effect, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve without, in other liquors. Nor is the fermentation (or call it concoction) of the humors in their Veſſels, hereby only advanced: But likewiſe the diſtribution of the firſt, and ſecond ways, (if I may ſo call them) is very much promoted: For

ſtill, as the body is carried forward, ſo of ten are the Abdominal Muſcles, gently and equally compreſſed, whereby the chyle is the more nimbly pretended from the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines forward, to mingle with blood. And again, upon the receſs of the body, the Abdomen being leſs compreſſed, than if the body ſet ſtill in the ſame ſcituation, is more dilated than uſually, and conſequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the chyle flowing, more plentifully from the ſtomack into the Inteſtines. So that, if it come faſter into the guts, and be driven faſter out, it muſt of neceſſity follow, that the diſtribution thereof ſhall be more readily performed. Now, for what we lately called, the diſtribution of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ways, that ſeems by the uſe of the Swing, to be improved after this manner: while the body moves forward, as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts are more compreſſed by the Medium, ſo the back parts are leſs compreſſed (and thereby, as we may ſay, their tone weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) whereby the habit doth not ſo forcibly reſiſt the afflux of humors flowing to that part: as in its middle, natural, and quiet ſcituation. And thus reciprocally, firſt one part, and then the other, are ſomewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41619:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſpoſed, for the Reception of their ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary juices, which I call the diſtribution of the ſecond ways. And thus much may ſuffice to have ſaid at preſent, concerning this matter. I ſhall only deſire my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he will not be over precipitious, nor let the novelty of our attempt ſurprize him to a prejudice: and that he be firſt, for his own ſake, well aſſured, he is Maſter of thoſe principles, upon which this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of ours (as upon ſo many goodly Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars) ſtands erected, before he proceed to condemn us. But if upon the ſerious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of this Treatiſe, by ſuch whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Cenſure we moſt value and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, we happen to be found light in our own Balance: We have at leaſt to plead, that we have neither miſpent much of our own, or their time in writing, or reading of it. And that though we failed, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was great and Honourable, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the benefit of mankind, which may in good part plead our excuſe, and their good favour make out the reſt.</p>
