            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Just and Modest Vindication of the
proceedings of the Two last PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAMENTS,</head>
            <p>THE Amazement which seiz'd every good Man, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the unlook'd for Dissolution of two Parliaments
within three Moneths, was not greater than at the
sight of a Declaration pretending to justifie, and give
Reasons, for such extraordinary proceedings.</p>
            <p>It is not to be denyed but that our Kings have in a great
measure been Intrusted with the Power of calling &amp; declaring
the Dissolutions of Parliaments. But least through defect
of Age, Experience, or Understanding, they should at any
time forget, or mistake our Constitution; or by-Passion, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Interest, or the influence of ill Counsellors, be so far misled
as not to Assemble Parliaments, when the Publick Affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it; or to Declare them Dissolved before the ends of their
Meeting were Accomplished: The Wisdom of our Ancestors
has provided, by divers Statutes; both for the
holding of Parliaments Annually,<note place="margin">4 Edw. 3 c. 14. 36 Ed. 3. c. 10. 2 R. 2. Nu. 28.</note> and that
they should not be Prorogued or Dissolved till
all the Petitions, &amp; Bills before them were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
and Redressed. The Constitution had
been equally Imperfect and Destructive of it self, had it been
left to the choice of the Prince, whether he would ever Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
a Parliament, or put into his power to dismiss them Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily
at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100673:2"/>
That Parliaments should thus Meet, and thus Sit, is secured
to us by the same Sacred tye, by which the King at his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
does Oblige himself, to let his Judges Sit to distribute
Justice every Term, and to preserve Inviolably all other Rights
and Liberties of his Subjects. Therefore abruptly to Dissolve
Parliaments at such a time, when nothing but the Legislative
Power, and the United Wisdom of the Kingdom could Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
us from our Just Fears, or secure us from our certain Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is very unsuitable to the great Trust reposed in the Prince,
and seems to express but little of that Affection which we will
always hope His Majesty bears towards His People &amp; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion. But 'tis not onely of the Dissolution it self that
we Complain. The manner of doing it, is unwarranted by the
Precedents of former Times, &amp; full of dangerous Consequents.
We are taught by the Writ of summons, that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are never called without the advice of the council, and
the usage of all Ages has been never to send them away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the same Advice. To forsake this safe method is to expose
the King Personally to the Reflections and Censures of the
whole Nation for so ungrateful an Action. Our Laws have
taken care to make the King always dear to his People, and to
preserve his Person Sacred in their esteem, by wisely preventing
him from appearing as Author of any thing which may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable
to them. 'Tis therefore that he doth not Execute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
considerable Act of Regal Power, till it be first Debated and
Resolved in Council, because then 'tis the Counsellors must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for the Advice they Give, and are Punishable for such
Orders as are Irregular and Illegal. Nor can his Ministers justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
any unlawful action under the color of the Ks. Commands,
since all his Commands that are contrary to Law, are void;
(which is the true Reason of that well known Maxim, that
the King can do no wrong.) A Maxim just in it self and alike
safe for the Prince, and for the Subject, there being nothing
more absurd, then that a Favorite should excuse his enormous
Actings by a pretended Command, which we may reasonably
suppose he first procured to be laid upon himself. But we
know not whom to charge with Advising this last Dissolution:
It was a work of Darkness, and if we are not Misinform'd, the
Privy Council was as much surpriz'd at it as the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100673:2"/>
Nor will a future Parliament be able to Charge any Body as
the Author or Adviser of the late Printed Paper, which bears
the Title of <hi>His Majesties Declaration,</hi> though every good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
ought to be careful how he calls it so. For His Majesty
never speaks to his People as a King, but either Personally in
his Parliament, or at other times under his Seal, for which the
Chancellor or other Officers are Responsible, if what passes
them be not Warranted by Law. Nor can the direction of the
Privy Council enforce any thing upon the People unless that
Royal and Legal stamp gives it an Authority. But this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
comes abroad without any such Sanction, and there is no
other ground to ascribe it to His Majesty, than the uncertain
Credit of the Printer, whom we will easily suspect of an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
rather than think the King would deviate from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
course of H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Illustrious Ancestors, to pu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sue a New
and Unsuccessful Method.</p>
            <p>The first Declaration of this sort, which I ever met with,
being that which was published in the Year, 1628. Which
was so far from answering the ends of its coming out, that it
fill'd the whole Kingdom with Jealousies, and was one of the
first sad Causes of the ensuing Unhappy War.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, Declarations to justifie what Princes do, must
always be either needless or ineffectual. Their Actions ought
to be such as may recommend themselves to the World, and
carry their own Evidence along with them of their usefulness to
the Publick, and then no Arts to justifie them will be necessary.
When a Prince descends so low as to give his Subjects Reasons
for what he has done, he not only makes them Judges whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any weight in those Reasons, but by so unusual a
submission gives cause to suspect, that he is conscious to himself
that his Actions want an Apology. And if they are indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable,
if they are Opposite to the inclinations, &amp; apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destructive of the Interests of his Subjects, it will be very
difficult for the most Eloquent or Insinuating Declaration, to
make them in Love with such things. And therefore they did
certainly undertake no easie task in pretending to perswade
Men who see themselves exposed to the restless Malice of their
Enemies, who observe the languishing condition of the Nation,
&amp; that nothing but a Parliament can provide Remedies for the
great Evils which they Feel and Fear; that two several Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100673:3"/>
upon whom they had placed all their hopes, were so
suddenly broken out of kindness to them, or with any regard
to their Advantage. It was generally believed that this age
would not have seen another Declaration, since <hi>Colemans</hi> was
so unluckily published before its time: Not only because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the World was taught how little they ought to rely upon
the sincerity of such kind of Writings, but because that was a
Master-peice, which could hardly be equall'd, and our present
Ministers may well be out of countenance, to see their Copy
fall so very much short of the Original.</p>
            <p>But should this Declaration be suffered to go abroad any
longer under the Royal Name, yet it will never be thought to
have proceeded from His Majesties inclination or his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but to be gained from him by the Artificies of the same
ill Men, who not being content to have prevailed with him to
Dissolve two Parliaments only to protect them from Publick
Justice, do now hope to excuse themselves from being thought
the Authors of that Counsel by making him Openly to Avow
it. But they have discovered themselves to the Kingdom, and
have told their own Names, when they number amongst the
great Crimes of the House of Commons, their having <hi>Declared
divers Eminent Persons to be Enemies to the King and Kingdom.</hi>
'Tis our happiness that the Cunning of these <hi>Eminent Persons</hi> is
not equal to their Malice, in that they should thus unwarily
make themselves known when they had so secretly and with so
much Caution given the Pernicious Advice. None could be
offended at the proceedings of the Parliaments but they who
were obnoxious, none could be concern'd to vindicate the
Dissolution but they who had Advised it. But they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
this last undertaking after such a sort that they have left
themselves not only without a Justification but without all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
herafter. The People were willing to think it the Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
effect of some suddain and precipitate Resolution, but
since they have now publickly assured us, that it was the result
of Counsel and Deliberation, they cannot blame us for hoping
one day to see Justice done upon such Counsellors.</p>
            <p>But though to the dishonour of our Country it does appear
that some English men were concern'd in the unhappy Advice,
of breaking the two last Parliaments, and setting out this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
defence of it, yet the Gallicisms which are found in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100673:3"/>
Paper shew the Writer to have been of another Nation, or at
least to have had his thoughts so much taken up for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests
of <hi>France,</hi> (whilst he was laboring this way to heighten and
perpetuate the differences between the King and his People,)
that he could not express himself in any other idiom then
theirs, he would not otherwise have introduced the King say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That <hi>it was a matter extreamly sensible to Vs;</hi> a form of
speech peculiar to the French, and unknown to any other
Nation. The Reader (who understands that Language) will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
so many more of this Kind as will give him just cause to
doubt, whether the whole Paper was not a Translation, and
whether the English one, or that which was published in French
was the Original.</p>
            <p>Let us then no longer wonder that the time of Dissolving our
Parliaments is known at <hi>Paris</hi> sooner then at <hi>London,</hi> since 'tis
probable the Reasons now Given for it were formed there too.
The Peers at <hi>Oxford</hi> were so totally ignorant of the Council,
that they never once thought of a Dissolution, till they heard it
pronounced; but the Dutchess of <hi>Mazarine</hi> had better Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and published the News at St. <hi>James</hi>'s many hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was done. This Declaration was not Communicated to
the Privy Council till Friday the 8. of <hi>April,</hi> when His Majesty
(according to the late method) did Gratiously declare to them
his pleasure to set it forth, without desiring from them any
Advice in the matter, but Monsieur <hi>Barillon,</hi> the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
did not only Read it to a Gentleman the fifth of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi>
but advised with him about it and demanded his Opinion
of it, which his Excellency will the better remember because of
the great liberty which the Person took in Ridiculing it to his
Face. <hi>Good God, to wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t a Condition is this Kingdom reduced, when
the Ministers and Agents of the only Prince in the World, who can
have Designs against us, or of whom we ought to be afraid, are not
only made acquainted with the most secret Passages of State, but are
made our Cheif Ministers too, and have the Principal Conduct of
our Affairs.</hi> And let the World judge if the Commons had
not Reason for their Vote, when they Declared those <hi>Eminent
Persons</hi> who manage things at this rate, <hi>to be Enemies to the
King and Kingdom, and Promoters of the French Interest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whosoever considers the Actions of our Great Men, will not
think it strange that they should be hard put to it to find out
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100673:4"/>
Reasons which they might give for any of them, and they have
had very ill luck when ever they went about it. That Reason
which they have given for Dissolving three several Parliaments
successively is now grown ridiculous, <hi>that the King was resolved
to meet his People and to have their Advice in frequent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
since every Man took notice that as soon as the Ministers
began to suspect that His Majesty was inclined to hearken to
and pursue their Advice, those very Parliaments were presently
Dissolved. This was all the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Cause,</hi> which was
thought of for breaking the last Parliament at <hi>Westminister,</hi>
when the Proclamation of the 8th. of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1680 was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
but, they have now considered better and have found out
faults enough to swel into a Declaration, and yet as much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
as they are with this Parliament, they seem more highly
Angry with that which followed at <hi>Oxford.</hi> Nor is it at all
strange that it should fall out so, for the Court did never yet
Dissolve a Parliament abruptly and in a heat, but they found
the next Parliament more Averse, and to insist upon the same
things with greater eagerness then the former. English Spirits
resent no Affronts so highly as those which are done to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives;
and the Court will be sure to find the Effects of
that Resentment in the next Election. A Parliament does ever
participate of the present temper of the People. Never were
Parliaments of more different Complexions than that of 1640.
And that of 1661. Yet they both exactly answered the humors
which were predominant in the Nation, when they were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively
chosen. And therefore while the People do so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
Hate and Fear <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> and do so well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
who they are who promote the French and Popish Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
the Favourites do but Cozen themselves to think that they
will ever send up Representatives less Zealous to bring them
to Justice, then those against whom this Declaration is publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For surely this Declaration (what great things soever may
be expected from it) will make but very few Converts, not
only because it represents things as high Crimes, which the
whole Kingdom has been Celebrating as Meritorious Actions,
but because the People have been so often deceived by former
Declarations, that whatsoever carries that Name, will have
no Credit with them for the future. They have not yet forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the Declaration from <hi>Breda,</hi> though others forgot it so soon,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100673:4"/>
and do not spare to say, that if the same diligence, the same
earnest sollicitations had been made use of in that Affair, which
have been since exercised directly contrary to the Design of it,
there is no doubt but every part of it would have had the desired
success, &amp; all His Majesties Subjects would have enjoyed the
fruits of it, and have now been extolling a Prince so careful to
keep Sacred His promises to His People. If we did take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the several Declarations Published since that which we
have last mentioned, we should find they signified as little; &amp;
therefore we will only remember the last made the 20th. of
<hi>April.</hi> 1679. And Declared in Council, and in Parliament, &amp;
after published to the whole Nation: Wherein His Majesty
owns that he is <hi>sensible of the ill posture of his affairs, and the
great Jealousies and Dissatisfaction of his good Subjects, whereby
the Crown and Government was become too weak to preserve it self,
which proceeded from his use of a single Ministry and of private
Advices; and therefore professes his Resolution to lay them wholly
aside for the future, and to be Advised by those Able and Worthy
Persons, whom he had then chosen for his Council, in all his
Weighty and Important Affairs.</hi> But every man must Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that either His Majesty has utterly forgotten this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and solemn Promise, or else that nothing <hi>Weighty and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant</hi>
has happened from that time to this very Day.</p>
            <p>As for the Declaration read in our Churches the other day,
there needs no other Argument to make us d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ubt of the reality
of the promises which it makes, then to consider how partially,
&amp; with how little sincerity the things which it pretends to relate
are therein represented. It begins with telling us in His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
name, That <hi>it was with exceeding great trouble that he was
brought to Dissolve the Two last Parliaments, without more benefit
to the People by the calling of them.</hi> We should question His
Majesties Wisdom, did we not belive him to have understood
that never Parliament had greater <hi>Opportunities</hi> of doing good
to himself and to his People. He could not but be sensible of
the Dangers, and of the Necessities of His Kingdom, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not without <hi>exceding great Trouble</hi> be prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the sake of a few desperate men, (whom he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
concern'd to love now, only becaus he had loved them too
well, &amp; Trusted them too much before;) not only to disappoint
the Hopes and Expectations of his own People, but of all most
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100673:5"/>
               <hi>Europe.</hi> His Majesty did indeed <hi>do His Part,</hi> so far, in <hi>giving
Opportunities of providing for our good,</hi> as the calling of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
does amount to, and it is to be <hi>Imputed</hi> to the Ministers
only <hi>that the success</hi> of them <hi>did not answer His</hi> and Our <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.</hi>
'Tis certain it cannot be imputed to any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of either of those Parliaments; which were composed
of Men of as good Sence, and Quality as any in the Nation, and
proceeded with as great moderation, and managed their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
with as much temper as was ever known in any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If they seem'd to go too far in any thing, His Majesties
Speeches or Declarations had misled them, by some of which
they had been invited to enter into every one of those Debates,
to which so much exception had been since taken. Did he not
frequently recommend the <hi>prosecution of the Plot</hi> to them, <hi>with
a strict and impartial inquiry.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Speech, 21 Oct 1680</note> Did he not tell them, That <hi>he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thought himself nor them safe, till that matter was gone through
with?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Speech, 30 Apr. 1679</note> Did he not in his Speech of the 30th. of <hi>April,</hi> 1679.
Assure them that it was <hi>his constant care to secure our Religion for
the future in all Events, and that in all things which concern'd the
Publick security he would not follow their Zeal but lead it?</hi> Has
he not often <hi>wish'd that he might be enabled to exercise a Power of
Dispensation in Reference to those Protestants,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Speech, 26 Oct. 1662</note> 
               <hi>who through tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of misguided Conscience did not Conform, to the Ceremonies,
Discipline and Government of the Church:</hi> And promised that he
would <hi>make it his special Care to encline the wisdom of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to concur with him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Speech, 26 Dec. 1662</note> 
               <hi>in making an Act to that Purpose?</hi>
And least the malice of ill men might Object, that these Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
inclinations of His continued no longer, then while there
was a possibility of giving the Papists equal benefit of a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Has not His Majesty since the Discovery of the Plot,
since there was no hopes of getting so much as a connivence for
them,<note place="margin">Speech, 6 March, 1679</note> in His Speech of the 6th. of <hi>March,</hi> 1679. Exprest <hi>His
Zeal</hi> not only <hi>for the Protestant Religion in general, but for an
Vnion amongst all sorts of Protestants.</hi> And did he not Command
My Lord Chancellor, at the same time, to tell them <hi>that it was
necessary to distinguish between Popish and other Recusants, between
them that would destroy the whole Flock, and them that onely wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from it?</hi> These things considered we should not think the
Parliament went too far, but rather that they did not follow His
Majesties Zeal with an equal pace. The Truth is if we observe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100673:5"/>
The daily provocations of the Popish Faction, whose Rage and
Insolence were only increased by the Discovery of the Plot, (so
that they seemed to defy Parliaments, as well as inferior Courts
of Justice, under the Protection of the Duke, their publickly
avowed head;) who still carryed on their designs by new and
more detestable methods than ever, and were continually bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
by Perjuries and Subornations, to charge the best and most
considerable Protestants in the Kingdom with Treasons, as
black as those of which themselves were Guilty. If we observe
what vile Arts were used to hinder the further discovery, what
Liberty was given to Reproach the Discoverers, what means
used to destroy or to Corrupt them; how the very Criminals
were encouraged and allowed to be good Witnesses against
their Accusers: We should easily excuse an English Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thus beset, if they had been carried to some little excesses.
But yet all this could not provoke them to do any thing
not justifiable by the Laws of Parliament, or unbecoming the
Wisdom and Gravity of an English Senate.</p>
            <p>But we are told that His Majesty <hi>Opened the last Parliament,
which was held at</hi> Westminster, <hi>with as Graciom Expressions of His
readiness to satisfie the desires of his Subjects, and to secure them
against all their just Fears, as the weighty consideration, either of
preserving the Established Religion and Property of His Subjects
at Home, or of supporting His Neighbors and Allies abroad could
fill His Heart with.</hi> We must own that His Majesty has
Opened all His Parliaments at <hi>Westminister,</hi> with very
<hi>Gracious Expressions;</hi> nor have we wanted that Evidence of His
<hi>readiness to satisfie the desires of His Subjects,</hi> but that sort of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
will soon lose it's force if it be never followed by
Actions correspondent, by which only the World can judge of
the sincerity of Expressions or Intentions. And therefore the
Favourites did little Consult His Maiesties Honor, when they
bring him in solemnly <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>claring</hi> to His Subjects, <hi>that His Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were as far as would have consisted with the very being of the
Government, to have Complyed with any thing that could have been
proposed to him to Accomplish those Ends;</hi> when they are not able
to produce an instance wherein they suffered him to comply in
any One thing. Whatsoever the House of Commons Address'd
for was certainly denied, though it was only for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and there was no surer way of intituling ones self to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100673:6"/>
the favor of the Court, then to receive a Censure from the
Representative Body of the People. Let it for the present be
admitted that some of the things desired by that Parliament
were exorbitant, and (because we will put the Objection as
strong as is possible) inconsistent with the very being of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
yet at least some of their Petitions were more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.
The Government might have subsisted though the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
put out of the Commission of the Peace, for their Zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
acting against the Papists, had been restor'd; nor would a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Dissolution of all things have ensued, tho Sir <hi>G. Jefferies</hi> had
been removed out of publick Office, or my Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi>
himself from His Majesties Presence and Councils. Had the
Statute of the 35th. of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (which had justly
slept for 80 years, and of late, unseasonably revived) been
repealed, surely the Government might still have been safe.
And though the Fanaticks perhaps had not deserved so well
as that in favor to them, His Majesty should have passed that
Bill, yet since the Repeal might hereafter be of so great use to
those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in case of a Popish Successor,
(which blessing His Majesty seems resolved to bequeath to His
People;) one would have thought he might have Complyed
with the Parliament in that proposal. At least we should have
had less Reason to complain of the refusal, if the King would
have been but Graciously pleased to have done it in the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way. But the Ministers thought they had not sufficiently tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
over the Parliament by getting the Bill rejected, unless
it were done in such a manner as that the Precedent might be
more pernicious to posterity, by introducing a new Negative in
the making of Laws, then the losing of any Bill, how useful so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
could be to the present Age. This we may affirm, that
if the success of this Parliament did not answer expectation,
whoever was guilty of it, the House of Commons did not fail
of <hi>doing their Part.</hi> Never did men Husband their time to
more advantage. They opened the eyes of the Nation, they
shewed them their danger with a freedom becoming English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
They asserted the Peoples Right of Petitioning, they
proceeded vigorously against the Conspirators discovered and
heartily endeavored to take away the very Root of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy.
They had before them as many great and useful Bills
as had been seen in any Parliament, and it is not to be laid at
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100673:6"/>
their doors that they proved Abortive. This Age will never
fail to give them their grateful acknowledgments, and posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will remember that House of Commons with Honor.</p>
            <p>We come now to the particular enumeration of those Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things which were said to the Parliament at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
His Majesty askt of them <hi>the supporting the Allyances he had
made for the preservation of the General Peace in Christendom.</hi> 'Tis
to be wish'd His Majesty had added to this Gracious asking of
Money, a gracious Communication of those Alliances, and that
such blind obedience had not been exacted from them, as to
contribute to the support of they knew not what themselves;
nor before they had considered whether those Alliances which
were made, were truly design'd for that end which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
or any way likely to prove effectual to it. Since no
precedent can be shown, that ever a Parliament, (not even the
late long Parliament, tho filled with <hi>Danby</hi> his Pensioners)
did give Money for Maintaining of any Leagues till they were
first made acquainted with the particulars of them. But besides
this the Parliament had reason to consider well of the General
Peace it self, and the Influence it might have, and had, upon
our Affairs, before they came to any Resolution, or so much
as to a Debate about preserving it; since so wise a Minister as
my L. <hi>Chancellor</hi> had so lately told us,<note place="margin">Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors Speech 23. May 1678.</note> that it was <hi>fitter for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
than Discourse.</hi> He informed us in the same Speech,
that the peace then was but the effect of Despair in the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,
and we have since learn't by whose means they were
reduced to that despair; and what price was demanded of the
<hi>French King</hi> for so great a service. And we cannot but be sadly
sensible how by this Peace, that Monarch has not only quite
Dissolv'd the Confederacy form'd against him, enlarged his
Dominions, gain'd time to Refresh his Soldiers harrassed with
long service, setled and composed his Subjects at Home, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
his Fleet, and replenished his Exchequer for new and
greater designs; but his Pensioners at our Court have grown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
upon it, and presuming that now he may be at leasure to
assist them in Ruining <hi>England,</hi> and the Protestant Religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
have shaken off all dread of Parliaments, and have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
with His Majesty to use them with as little respect, and to
disperse them with as great Contempt, as if they had been a
Conventicle, and not the great Representative of the Nation,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100673:7"/>
whose Power and Wisdom only could save Him and Us, in our
present exigencies.</p>
            <p>But whatever the design of them was, or the effect of them
is like to be, yet Alliances have a very good sound, and a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so encompassed with Enemies abroad, and Traitors and
Pensioners to those Enemies at home, must needs be glad to
hear of any new Friends. But alas if we look into the Speech
made at the opening of that Parliament, we shall find no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any new Ally except the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whose Affairs at that
time, through the defects of his own Government, and the
Treachery of our Ministers, were reduced to so desperate a
state, that he might well be a Burden to us, but there was little
to be hoped from a Friendship with him; unless by the name of
a League to recommend our Ministers to a new Parliament, &amp;
couzen Country Gentlemen out of their Money. But upon
perusal of that League it appears by the third, fourth and fifth
Articles, that it was like to create us Troubles enough, for
it engages us indefinitely to enter into all the Quarrels of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> tho they happened in the <hi>West-Indies</hi> or the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
Islands,</hi> or were drawn upon himself by his own injustice or
causeless provocations. By this we shall be obliged to espouse
his difference with the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> tho all that
Duke did, was according to the Law of Nations, to Reprize
<hi>Spanish</hi> Ships for a just Debt frequently demanded in vain. By
this we shall be obliged to engage in his present War with the
<hi>Portuguese,</hi> tho he by his violent seizing of the Island of St.
<hi>Gabriel,</hi> which had been long in their peaceable possession,
without once demanding it of them, has most justly provoked
the <hi>Portuguese</hi> to invade <hi>Spain.</hi> Nor are we bound only to
assist him in case of an Invasion, but in case of any disturbance
whatsoever, which must be intended of intestine Troubles,
(and it is so directly explained in the secret Article which all
<hi>Europe</hi> says was signed at the same time.) So that if the present
King of <hi>Spain</hi> should imitate his great Grand-father <hi>Philip</hi> the
second, &amp; oppress any of his Subjects as cruelly as he did those
of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and so force them to a necessary self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
we have renounced the policy, of our Ancestors, who
thought it their interest as well as their Duty to succor the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed,
and must not only aid him with 8000 Men for three
Months to make those People slaves, but if the matter cannot
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100673:7"/>
be composed in that time make War upon them, with our
whole force both by Land and Sea. But that which concerns
us yet nearer in this League, is, that this obligation of assistance
was mutual, so that if a disturbance should happen hereafter in
<hi>England</hi> upon any attempt to change our Religion or our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
though it was in the time of his Majesty Successors,
the most Catholick King is obliged by this League, (which we
are still to believe was entred into, for the security of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion, and the good of the Nation) to give aid to so
Pious a Design, and to make War upon the people with all his
Forces both by Land and Sea. And therefore it was no wonder
that the Ministers were not forward in shewing this League to
the Parliament, who would have soon observed all these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies,
and have seen how little such a League could
contribute to the preserving the general Peace, or to the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of <hi>Flanders,</hi> since the French King may within one months
time possess himself of it, and we by the League are not oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to send our Succors till 3 Months after the Invasion. So that
they would upon the whole matter, have been inclined to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that the main end of this League was only to serve for a
handsom pretence to raise an Army in <hi>England,</hi> and if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
here should grow discontented at it, and any little disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
should ensue, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is thereby obliged to send o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Forces to suppress them.</p>
            <p>The next thing <hi>recommended to them was the farther exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Plot,</hi> and every one who has observed what has
passed for more than two years together, cannot doubt that
this was sincerely desired by such as are most in credit with his
Majesty, and then surely the Parliament deserv'd not to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
upon this account, since the examination of so many new
Witnesses, the Trial of the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> the great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the Trial of the rest of the Lords, and their diligent
inquiry into the Horrid Irish Treasons, shew that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wanted no diligence to pursue his Majesties good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in that affair.<note place="margin">Address<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> presented, 21 <hi>Dec.</hi> 1680.</note> And when His Majesty <hi>desired from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
their Advice and Assistance concerning the preservation of
Tangier,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Address presented 29 <hi>Nov.</hi> 1680.</note> the Commons did not neglect to give its due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
They truly represented to him how that important
place came to be brought into <hi>such exigencies, after so vast a
Treasure expended to make it useful,</hi> and that nothing better
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100673:8"/>
could be expected of a Town, <hi>for the most part put under Popish
Governours;</hi> and always <hi>fill'd with a Popish Garrison.</hi> These
were evils in His Majesties own power to redress, and they
<hi>advised him to it;</hi> nor did they rest there, but promise to assist
him in defence of it, as soon as ever they could be reasonably
secured, that any <hi>Supply</hi> which they gave for that purpose,
should <hi>not be used to Augment the strength of our Popish Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and to encrease our Dangers at home.</hi> They had more than
once seen Money imployed directly contrary to the end for
which it was given by Parliament, &amp; they had too good cause of
fear it might be so again, and they knew that such a misimploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would have been fatal at that time. But above all they
considered the eminent dangers which threatned them with
certain Ruine at home; and therefore justly thought, that to
leave the consideration of <hi>England</hi> to provide for <hi>Tangier, would</hi>
be to Act like a Man that should send his Servants to mend a
gap in his hedge, when he saw his House on Fire, and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
like to be consumed in it. We are next told that His Majesty,
<hi>Offered to concur in any Remedies that could be proposed for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Protestant Religion,</hi> and we must own that he did
indeed make such an <hi>Offer,</hi> but he was pleased to go no further,
for those Remedies which the Commons tendred were reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and those which they were preparing, were prevented
by a Dissolution.</p>
            <p>We have seen the great things which the King did on his
part, let us now reflect on those instances which are singled out
as so many <hi>unsuitable returns of the Commons.</hi> They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of for presenting <hi>Addresses in the nature of Remonstrances
rather then Answers.</hi> Under what unhappy circumstances do we
find our selves, when our Representatives can never behave
themselves with that caution, but they will be misinterpreted
at Court. If the Commons had return'd Answer to His Majesties
Messages, without shewing upon what grounds they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
they had then been accused as men acting peremptorily &amp;
without reason; if they modestly express the reasons of their
Resolutions, they are then said to Remonstrate. But what the
Ministers would have this word Remonstrance signifie, what
Crime it is they mean thereby, to charge the Commons with,
is unknown to an English Reader. Perhaps they who are better
Critics and more French-men, know some pernicious thing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100673:8"/>
which it imports. If they mean by a Remonstrance, a <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Causes and Reasons</hi> of what they do; it will not surely
be imputed as a fault in them, since 'tis a way of proceeding
which His Majesties Ministers have justified by their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
having in His Majesties name vouchsafed to <hi>declare the
Causes and Reasons of his Actions</hi> to his People.</p>
            <p>But the Commons made <hi>Arbitrary Orders for taking Persons
into Custody, for matters that had no Relation to Priviledges of
Parliament.</hi> The Contrivers of this Declaration, who are so
particular in other things, would have done well to have given
some instances of these Orders.</p>
            <p>If they intend by these general words, to reflect on the Orders
made to take those degenerate wretches into Custody, who
published under their hands their Abhorrence of Parliaments,
and of those who in an humble and Lawful manner Petitioned
for their Setting, in a time of such extream necessity. Surely
they are not in good earnest, they cannot believe themselves
when they say, that <hi>these matters</hi> had no <hi>Relation to Priviledges of
Parliament</hi> if the Priviledg of Parliament be concern'd when an
injury is done to any particular Member, how much more is it
touched when men strike at Parliaments themselves, &amp; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to wound the very Constitution? if this be said with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to <hi>Sheridon,</hi> who has since troubled the World with so
many idle impudent Pamphlets upon that account, 'tis plain
that his Commitment was only in order to examine him about
the Popish Plot, and his indeavors to stifle it, (though his
contemptuous behaviour to the House deservd a much longer
Confinement) and 'twas insolence in him to Arraign their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
because they did not instantly leave all their great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
to dispatch the business relating to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thompson</hi> of <hi>Bristol,</hi> was Guilty of divers great Breaches of
Priviledge, but yet his Commitment was only in order to an
Impeachment, and assoon as they had gone through with his
Examination, they ordered him to be set at Liberty, giving
security to answer the Impeachment which they had Voted
against him. But is it a thing so strange &amp; new to the Authors
of the Declaration, that the House of Commons should order
men to be taken into Custody for matters not relating to Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
Have they not heard, that in the 4. <hi>Edw. 6. Criketost</hi>

            <p>There would be no end of giving instances of those Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which may be observed in almost every Parliament, so
that the House of Commons did but tread in the steps of their
Predecessors, and these sorts of Orders where not new, though
the Declaration take the Liberty to call them Arbitrary. The
Commons had betray'd their Trust, if they had not Asserted
the Right of Petitioning, which had been just before shaken,
by such a <hi>strange Illegal and Arbritary Proclamation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now we come to the Transcendent monstrous Crimes,
which can never be forgiven by the Ministers, the giving them
their due Character, which every man of understanding had
fix'd upon them long before; the whole current of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
being a full proof of the Truth of the Charge. But what
colour is there for calling these Votes illegal? is it illegal for
the Commons to Impeach Persons, whom they have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to judge Enemies to the King and Kingdom? Is it illegal to
determine by a Vote (which is the only way of finding the
sence of the House) who are wicked Counsellors &amp; deserve to
be Impeached? Could the Commons have called the parties
accused to make their answer before themselves? Had they not
a proper time for their defence when they came to their Trals,
&amp; might they not have cleared their innocence much better, (if
they durst have put that in issue,) by a Tryal, then a Dissolution
of the Parliamen? But should we grant that these Votes were
not made in order to an Impeachment, yet still there is nothing
illegal, nothing extraordinary in them. For the Commons in
Parliament have ever used 2 ways of delivering their Country
from pernicious &amp; powerful Favourites, the one is in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
course of Justice by Impeaching them, which is used
when they Judg it needful to make them publick Examples, by
Capital, or other high Punishments, for the terror of others:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100673:10"/>
The other is by immediate Address to the King to remove
them as unfaithfnl or unprofitable Servants. Their Lives their
Liberties or Estates are never endangered, but when they are
proceeded against in the former of these ways. Then legal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of their Guilt is necessary, then there must be a proper
time allowed for their defence. In the other way the Parliament
Act as the Kings great Council, and when either House observe
that Affairs are ill administred, that the advice of Parliaments
is rejected or slighted, the Course of Justice perverted, our
Councels betray'd, Greivances multiplyed, &amp; the Government
weakly and disorderly managed, (of all which our Laws have
made it impossible for the King to be guilty). They necessarily
must, and always have charg'd those who had the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Affairs, and the Kings Ear, as the Authors of these
mischeifs, and have from time to time applyed themselves to
him by Addresses for their Removal from his Presence and
Councils. There be many things plain and evident beyond the
Testimony of any Witnesses, which yet can never be proved in
a legal way. If the King will hearken to none but two or three
of his Minions, must we not conclude that every thing that is
done comes from their Advice? And yet, if this way of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
things to the King were not allowed, they might easily
frustrate the enquiries of a Parliament. It is but to whisper
their Counsels, and they are safe. The Parliament may be busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in such great Affairs, as will not suffer them to pursue every
Offender through a long Process; and besides there may be
many reasons why a man should be turn'd out of a service,
which perhaps would not extend to subject him to punishment.
The People themselves are highly concern'd in the great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Ministers of State, who are Servants to the Kingdom
as well as to the King. And the Representatives of the People,
the Commons, whose business it is to present all Greivances, as
they are most likely to observe soonest the Folly and Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of those publick Servants, (the greatest of all Greivances) so
this Representation ought to have no little weight with the
Prince.<note place="margin">Rot Part, 5. H. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nu. 16.</note> This was understood so well by <hi>H.</hi> 4. a Wise and brave
Prince, that when the Commons complain'd against four of
his Servants, and Councellors, desiring they might be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he came into Parliament and there declared openly that
though he knew nothing against them in particular, yet he was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100673:11"/>
assured that what the Lords and Commons desired of him, was
for the good of himself and his Kingdom; and therefore he did
comply with them, and banish'd those four Persons from his
Presence and Councils, declaring at the same time, that he
would do so by any others who should be near His Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
if they were so unhappy to fall under the Hatred and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
of his People. The Records and Histories of the
Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> the first, <hi>Edw.</hi> II <hi>Edw.</hi> III. and indeed of
all other succeeding Kings are full of such Addresses as these;
but no History or Record can shew that ever they were called
illegal or Un-Parliamentary till now.</p>
            <p>Then the Ministers durst not appeal to the People against
their own Representatives, but ours at present have either got
some new Law in the point, or have attained to a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Confidence, then any that went before them. The best
of our Princes have with thanks acknowledged the Care and
Duty of their Parliaments, in telling them of their Corruption
and Folly of their Favourites. <hi>E. I. E. II. H. VI. H. V.</hi> and
<hi>Q. El.</hi> never faild to do it, and no Names are remembred with
greater Honour in the English Annals. Whilst the disorderly,
the Troublesom and Unfortunate Reigns of <hi>H.</hi> III. <hi>Ed.</hi> II.
R. II. and <hi>H.</hi> the VI. ought to serve as Land Marks to
warn succeeding Kings from preferring secret Councels to
the Wisdom of their Parliaments.</p>
            <p>But none of the Proceedings of the House of Commons, have
been more censured at Court, and with less Justice, then their
Vote about the Anticipation of several Branches of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.
An objection which could proceed from nothing, but a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
ignorance of the Nature of Publick Treasure in our own, &amp;
all other Nations, which was ever esteem'd Sacred &amp; Un-aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
All the Acts of resumption in the times of <hi>H.</hi> IV. <hi>H.</hi> VI. &amp;
other of our Kings were founded upon this Maxim, otherwise
there could not be conceived any grosser injustice, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
Alienations to be void, which Kings had lawful power to
make. It was upon this Maxim that the Parliament declar'd the
G<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ant to the Pope of the yearly summe of 1000 marks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
King <hi>John</hi> had charg'd the Inheritance of the Crown, to be
Null. It was for this cause that in the year 1670. His Majesty
procured an Act of Parliament, to enable him to sell the
Fee-Farm Rents, and it is the best excuse that can be made
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100673:11"/>
for those Ministers who in the year 1672. Advised the post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning
of all payments to the Bankers out of the Exchequer,
that they judged all securities by way of Anticipation of the
Revenue, illegal and void in themselves.</p>
            <p>Resumptions have been frequent in every Kingdom, the
King of <hi>Sweden</hi> within these few Moneths, has, by the Advice
of the States, resumed all the Lands which His Predecessors had
in many years before, Granted from the Crown. No Country
did ever beleive the Prince, how absolute soever in other
things, had power to sell or give away the Revenue of the
Kingdom, and leave his Successor a Beggar. All those Acts of
the Roman Emperors, whereby they wasted the Treasure of
the Empire, were rescinded by their Successors; and <hi>Tacitus</hi>
observes, that the first of them that look't upon the publick
Treasure as his own, was <hi>Claudius</hi> the weakest and most sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
of them all. The present King of <hi>France</hi> did within these
twelve years, by the consent of his several Parliaments, resume
all the Demesnes of the Crown, which had been Granted away
by himself or his Predecessors. That haughty Monarch, as
much power as he pretends to, not being asham'd to own that
he wanted power to make such Alienations, and that Kings had
that happy inability,<note place="margin">Traitte des dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its de la Reine.</note> that they could do nothing contrary to
the Laws of their Countrey. This notion seems founded in the
reason of mankind, since Barbarism it self cannot Efface it. The
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperours dispose Arbitrarily of the Lives and Estates
of their Subjects,<note place="margin">Ont cette bien heu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puissance de ne pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir rien faire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre les Loys de leur Pali. Post<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Turcicis.</note> but yet they esteem it the most detestable
wickedness, to employ the Tributes and Growing Revenues
of the Provinces, (which they call the Sacred blood of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;)
upon any other then publick occasions. And our Kings
<hi>H.</hi> IV. and <hi>H.</hi> 7, understood so well the different power they
had in using their private Inheritances and those of the Crown,
that they took care, by Authority of Parliament, to separate the
Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster</hi> from the Crown, and to keep the descent
of it distinct. But our present Courtiers are quite of another
Opinion, who speak of the Revenue of the Crown as if
it were a private Patrimony, and design'd only for domestic
uses, and for the Pleasures of the Prince</p>
            <p>The Revenues of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> are in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
appropriated to Publick Service; &amp; therefore cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
injustice be diverted or Anticipated. For either the Publick
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100673:12"/>
Revenue is sufficient to answer the necessary Occasions of the
Government, and then there is no color for Anticipations, or
else by some extraordinary accident the K. is reduced to want
an extraordinary supply, and then he ought to resort to his
Parliament. Thus wisely did our Ancestors provide, that the
K. and His People should have frequent need of one another,
&amp; by having frequent opportunities of mutually relieving one
anothers wants, be sure ever to preserve a dutiful affection in
the Subject, and a fatherly tenderness in the Prince. When the
King had occasion for the Liberality of his People, he would be
well inclin'd to hear and redress their Grievances, and when
they wanted ease from Oppressions they would not fail with
alacrity to supply the occasions of the Crown. And therefore it
has ever been esteem'd a crime in Counsellors who perswaded
the King to Anticipate his Revenue, and a Crime <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n those who
furnisht Money upon such Anticipations in an Extraordinary
way, however extraordinary the Occasion might be. For this
cause it was that the Parliament in the 35th. of <hi>H.</hi> 8. did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discharge all those debts which the K. had contracted, but
enacted that those Lenders who had been before paid again by
the King, should refund all those summs into the Exchequer, as
Judging it a reasonable punishment, to make them forfeit the
Money they lent, since they had gone about to introduce so
dangerous a Precedent.</p>
            <p>The true way to put the King out of a <hi>possibility of supporting
the Government,</hi> is to let him wast in one year that Money,
which ought to bear the charge of the Government for seven.
This is the d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rect method to destroy the <hi>Credit of the Crown both
Abroad and at Home.</hi> If the King resolve never to pay the
Money which he Borrows, what Faith will be given to Royal
Promises, and the Honor of the Nation will suffer in that of
the Prince, &amp; if it must be put upon the People to repay it, this
would be a way to impose a necessity of giving Taxes without
end, whether they would or no. And therefore (as Mercenary
as they were) the Pensioners would never discharge the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
of the Anticipations to the Bankers. Now the Commons
having the inconvenience of this before their Eyes in so fresh
an instance, &amp; having their Ears fill'd with the daily cries of so
many Widows and Orphans; were obliged in duty to give a
Public Caution to the people, that they should not run again into
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100673:12"/>
the same error. Not onely because they Judged all Securities
of that kind absolutely void, but because they knew no future
Parliament could without breach of Trust repay that Money
which was at first borrowed onely to prevent the Sitting of a
Parliament, and which could never be paid without Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing
a method so destructive to our Constitution. Nor have
former Parliaments been less careful &amp; nice, in giving the least
allowance to any unusual ways of taken up Money, without
Common Consent, having so very often declar'd that the King
cannot supply his most pressing Necessities, either by Loans
or by the Benevolence of his Subjects,<note place="margin">1. R 3. cap. 2.</note> which by the express
words of the Statute are damned and annulled for ever. But
the House of Commons were so Cautious of giving any just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of Cavil, that they restrain'd their Votes much more
then they needed to have done: For they extended them only
to three Branches of the Revenue, all which were by several
Acts of Parliament given to his present Majesty. And surely
every one will agree, that when the King receives a Gift from
his People, he takes it under such conditions, and ought to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it in such a manner, and for such purposes as they direct.
We must therefore consult the several Acts by which those
Branches were settled; if we would Judge rightly whether the
Commons had not particular reasons for what they did. The
Statute 12 <hi>Car. 2. c.</hi> 4. says,<note place="margin">12 Car. 2. c4. 4. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd 13. Car. 6 7.</note> That <hi>the Commons reposing Trust
in his Majesty, for Guarding the Seas against all Persons intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the disturbance of Trade, and the Invading of the Realm to
that intent do give him the Tonnage and Poundage,</hi> &amp;c. This is
as direct an Appropriation as Words can make, and therefore
as it is manifest wrong to the Subiect, to divert any part of this
Branch to other uses; So for the King to Anticipate it, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to disable himself to perform <hi>the Trust reposed in Him.</hi> And
the late long Parliament, thought this matter so clear, that
about two years before their Dissolution, they passed a Vote
with Relation to the Customs,<note place="margin">12 Car. 2. c. 23. an</note> in all most the same Words.
The Parliament which gave the Excise were so far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the King had power to charge or dispose of it as his
own, that by a special clause in the Act, whereby they give it,
they were careful to <hi>Impower him to dispose of it, or any part of
it by way of Farm,</hi> and to Enact <hi>that such contracts shall be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
in Law, so as they be not for a longer time then three years.</hi> The
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100673:13"/>
Act, whereby the Hearth-money was given, declares that it
was done to the end,<note place="margin">33 &amp; 14 Car. c. 10.</note> 
               <hi>that the public Revenue might be proportioned
to the public Charge,</hi> and 'tis imposible that should ever be,
whilst it is lyable to be pre-ingag'd and anticipated. And the
Parliament were so careful to preserve this Tax always clear
and uncharg'd, that they made it penal for any one so much as
<hi>to accept of any Pension or Grant for years, or any other Estate, or
any summe of Money out of the Revenue arising by vertue of that
Act, from the King, His Heirs or Successors.</hi> Surely if the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of this Declaration had not been altogether ignorant of
ourown Laws, and of the Policy of all other Countries &amp; Ages
they would never have Printed those Votes, in hopes thereby
to have exposed the Commons to the World. They would
not have had the face to say, that thereby the <hi>King was Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to Danger, deprived of a possibility of supporting the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and <hi>reduc'd to a more helpless condition then the meanest of
His Subjects.</hi> This we are sure of, that if the inviolable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
of these Statutes, will reduce His Majesty to a more
helpless Condition then the meanest of His Subjects, he will still
be left in a better condition then the Richest and Greatest of his
Ancestors, none of which were ever Masters of such a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</p>
            <p>The H. of Commons are in the next place accused of a very
high Crime, the assuming to themselves a power of suspending
Acts of Parliament, because they declared that it was their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>That the prosecution of Protestant Dissenters upon the penal
Laws, is at this time grievous to the Subject, a weakning of the
Protestant interest, an incouragement to Popery, and dangerous to
the Peace of the Kingdom.</hi> The Ministers remembred
that not many years ago, the whole Nation was justly
Alarm'd upon the assuming an Arbitrary power of suspending
penal Laws, &amp; therefore they thought it would be very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
to accuse the Commons of such an Attempt. But how they
could possible misinterpret a Vote at that Rate, how they could
say the Commons pretended to a power of repealing Laws,
when they only declare their Opinion of the inconveniency of
them, will never be understood till the Authors of this are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to <hi>shew their Causes and Reasons</hi> for it in a second <hi>Declaration.</hi>
Every impartial man will own, that the Commons had reason
for this opinion of theirs. They had with Great anxiety ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100673:13"/>
that the present design of the Papists was not against any
one sort of Protestants, but universal, and for extirpating the
Reform'd Religion. They saw what advantages these Enemies
made of our Divisions, &amp; how cunningly they diverted us from
persecuting them, by fomenting our jealousies of one anether.
They saw the strength and nearness of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and
Judged of his inclinations by his usage of his own Protestant
Subjects. They considered the number, &amp; the Bloody Principles
of the <hi>Irish,</hi> and what Conspiracies were form'd there, and even
Ripe for Execution; and that <hi>Scotland</hi> was already delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of a Prince, the known head of the Papists in these
Kingdomes, and the Occasion of all their Plots and Insolencies,
as more then one Parliament had declared. They could not
but take notice into what hands the most considerable Trusts
both Civil and Military where put, and that notwithstanding
all Addresses, &amp; all Proclamations for a strict Execution of the
penal Laws against Papists, yet their Faction so far prevailed,
that they were eluded, and only the dissenting Protestants
smarted under the edge of them. In the midst of such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
was there not cause to think an Union of all Protestants
necessary, and could they have any just ground to believe that
the Dissenters, whilst they lay under the pressures of severe
Laws, should with such Alacrity and Courage as was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
undertake the defence of a Countrey where they were
so ill treated? A long and sad Experience had shew'd, how vain
the endeavours of former Parliaments had been to force us to
be all of one Opinion, and therefore the House of Commons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to take a sure way to make us of one Affection. They
knew that some busie men would be striking whilst there were
weapons at Hand, and therefore to make us live at Peace, they
meant to take away all occasions of provoking or being provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
In order to a general Repeal of these Laws, they first
came to a Vote declaring the necessity of it, to which there was
not one Negative in the House: A Vote of this nature does for
the most part precede the bringing in of a Bill, for the Repeal
of any General Law. And it had been a great presumption in a
particular Member to have asked leave, to have brought in a
Bill for Repealing so many Laws together, till the House had
first declar'd that in their opinion they were <hi>Grievous &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</hi>
No <hi>English man</hi> could be so ignorant of our Laws, none
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100673:14"/>
but a <hi>French-man</hi> could have confidence to declaim against a
proceeding so regular and Parlimentary as this. Where was the
<hi>disregard to the Laws Established,</hi> for the Commons to attempt
the abrogating of a Law that is <hi>Grievous to the Subject, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to the Peace of the Kingdom? Is it a suspending Acts of
Parliament,</hi> if they declare a Law to be <hi>Grievous and dangerous</hi>
in their <hi>Opinion,</hi> before they set about the Repeal of it? And is
there any ground to doubt but that a Bill would have pass'd
that House, pursuant to this Vote, had it not been prevented by
a Dissolution? Nor was there the least direction or signification
to <hi>the Judges,</hi> which might give any occasion for the Reflection
which follows in the Declaration. The due and impartial Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Laws is the unquestionable Duty of the Judges,
&amp; we hope they will always remember that duty so well, as not
to necessitate a H. of Commons to do theirs, by calling them
to Account for making private Instructions the rule of their
Judgments, and acting as men who have more regard to their
Places then their Oaths. 'Tis too well known who it is that solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
and manages in favor of Judges, when a H. of Commons
does demand Justice against them, for breaking their Oaths.
And therefore the Publishers of this Declaration had said
something well, if when they tell us the Judges ought not to
break their Oaths in Reverence to the Votes of either H. they
had been pleased to add, not in respect of any Command from
the K. or Favorites. Then we should have no more Letters from
Secretaries of State to Judges sitting upon the Bench. Then we
should have no more Proclamations like that of the 14th <hi>Oct.
1662.</hi> Forbidding the Execution of the Laws concerning High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.
Nor that of the 10th. of <hi>May,</hi> 1672. Dispencing with
divers clauses in the Acts of Parliament for increase of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping;
Nor any more Declarations like that of the 15. of <hi>March,
1672.</hi> Suspending the penal Laws in matters Ecclesiastical.</p>
            <p>But the Judges are sworn to execute all Laws, yet their is
no obligation upon any man to inform against another. And
therefore though the Ministers prevented the Repeal of those
Laws, 'tis to be hop'd that this Vote will restrain every English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
from prosecuting Protestants, when so wise and great a
body have declared the pernicious effects of such aprosecution.
'Tis most true that in <hi>England</hi> no Law is abrogated by desue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
but it is no less true that there are many Laws still unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100673:14"/>
which are never Executed, nor can be without publick
detriment. The Judges know of many such dormant Laws,
&amp; yet they do not quicken the People to put them in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor think themselves Guilty of Perjury that they do not,
such are the Laws for wearing Caps, for keeping Lent, those
concerning Bowes and Arrows, about killing Calves, and
Lambs, and many others. And those who vex men by Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
on such antiquated Laws, have been ever lookt upon as
Infamous, and Disturbers of the publick quiet. Hence it is that
there are no Names remembred with greater detestation than
those of <hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley,</hi> the whole Kingdom abhor'd them
as Monsters in the time of <hi>H.</hi> VII. and they were punish'd as
Traitors in the Reign of his Son.</p>
            <p>The alteration of the circumstances whereupon a Law was
made, or if it be against the genius of the People, or have
effects contrary to the intent of the makers; will soon cause any
Law to be disused, and after a little disuse, the reviving of it
will be thought Oppression. Especially if experience has shewn
that by the non Execution, the quiet, the safety, and Trade of
the Nation have been promoted; of all which the Commons,
who are sent from every part of the Kingdom, are able to make
the clearest Judgment. Therefore after they have declared
their Opinions of the Inconvenience of reviving the Execution
of these Laws, which have lain asleep for divers years, tho the
Judges must proceed, if any forward Informers should give
them the trouble, yet they would not act wisely or honestly if
they should Encourage Informers, or quicken Juries by strict
and severe charges. Especially if it be considered that the Lords
also were preparing Bills in favor of Dissenters, and that the
King has wish'd often it was in his power to ease them. So that
tho there be no Act of Repeal formerly passed, we have the
consent and desire of all who have any share in making Acts.
But let this Vote have what consequence it will, yet sure the
Ministers had forgot that the Black Rod was at the door of the
House, to require them to attend His Majesty at the very time
when it was made, otherwise they would not have numbred it
amongst the causes, <hi>which occasioned the King to part with that
Parliament.</hi> And those that knew His Majesty was putting on
his Robes before that Vote passed, might imagine a Dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thus forseen, might occasion it, but cannot be brought to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100673:15"/>
believe, that the Vote which was not in being, could occasion
the Dissolution. These are the <hi>proceedings</hi> which the Ministers
judg <hi>unwarrantable</hi> in the Parliament at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and for
which they prevailed with His Majesty <hi>to part with it.</hi> But
since it is evident upon Examination, that the principles of our
Constitution, the method of Parliaments, and the precedents of
every Age, were their Guide and Warrant in all those things;
surely the K. must needs be alike offended with the Men about
him, for perswading him to Dissolve that Parliament without
any Cause; and for setting forth in his Name a Declaration of
such pretended cause as every man almost sees through, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
only to cover those Reasons which they durst not Own.
But with what face can they object to the House of Commons
their <hi>strange Illegal Votes declaring divers Eminent Persons to be
Enemies to the King and Kingdom,</hi> when at the same time they
arrogate to themselves an unheard of Authority to Arraign one
of the three Estates in the face of the World, for <hi>usurping power
over the Laws, Imprisoning their fellow Subjects Arbitrarily, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the Kingdom to the greatest dangers, and endeavoring to
deprive the King of all possibility of supporting the Government,</hi>
and all this without any order or process of Law, without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their defence, and as much without any reason, as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.
We have had Ministers heretofore so bold, (yet ever
with ill success) as to accuse a pretended Factious party in the
House, but never did any go so high as openly to Represent the
whole H. of Commons as a Faction, much less, to cause them
to be denounced in all the Churches of the Kingdom, that so
the People might look upon it as a kind of Excommunication.
But if they erred in the things they judged rightly in the choice
of the Persons who were to publish it. Blind Obedience was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
where such unjustifiable things were imposed, and that
could be no where so entire, as amongst those Clergy men
whose preferment depended upon it. Therefore it was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that this Declaration should be read by them, being pretty
well assured that they would not unwillingly read in the Desk,
a Paper so suitable to the Doctrin w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> some of them had often
declared in the Pulpit. It did not become them to enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they had sufficient Authority for what they did; since the
Printer called it the Ks. Declaration, &amp; whether they might not
one day be call'd to account for publishing it; nor once to ask if

what His Majesty singly ordered when he sate in Council, and
came forth without the stamp of the great Seal, gave them a
sufficient warrant to read it publickly.</p>
            <p>Clergy-men seldom make Reflections of this kind, least they
should be thought to dispute the commands of their Superiors.
It hath been observed, that they who allow unto themselves the
liberty of doubting, advance their fortunes very slowly, whilst
such who obey without scruple, go on with a success equal to
their ambition. And this carries them on without fear or shame,
and as little thought of a Parliament, as the Court Favorites
who took care to Dissolve that at <hi>Oxford,</hi> before they durst tell
us the faults of that at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have already answer'd the miscarriages objected to the
first, and may now take a view of those imputed to the other,
which they say <hi>was Assembled as soon as that was Dissolved,</hi> and
might have added <hi>Dissolved as soon as Assembled.</hi> The Ministers
having employ'd the People forty days in chusing Knights and
Burgesses, to be sent home in eight, with a Declaration after
them, as if they had been called together only to be affronted.
The Declaration doth not tell us of any gracious expressions
used at the opening of that Parliament, perhaps because the
store was exhausted by the abundance which His Majesty was
pleased to bestow on them in his former Speeches. But we
ought to believe that His Majesties Heart was as full of them
as ever, and if he did not express them, it is to be imputed unto
the Ministers, who diverted him from his own inclinations, and
brought him to use a language until that day unknown unto
Parliaments. The Gracious Speech then made, &amp; the Gracious
Declaration that followed, are so much of a piece, that we may
justly conclude the same Persons to have been Authors of both.
How ever His Majesty failed not to give good advice unto
them, who were called together to advice him. The Parliament
had so much respect of their K. as not particularly to complain
of the great invasion, that was made upon their liberty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
&amp; debating Laws, by his telling them before hand what
things they should meddle with, and what things, no reasons
they could offer, should perswade him to consent unto.</p>
            <p>But every man must be moved to hear it charged upon them
as an unpardonable disobedience, that they did not obsequiosly
submit to that irregular Command, of not touching on the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100673:16"/>
of the succesion. Shall two or three unknown Minions
take upon them, like the Lords of the Articles of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to
prescribe unto an English Parliament what things they shall
treat off? Do they intend to have Parliaments <hi>inter instrumenta
servitutis,</hi> as the Romans had Kings in our Country? This would
quickly be, if what was then attempted had succeeded, and
should be so pursued hereafter, that Parliaments should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
what they were to meddle with, and threatned if they
do any other thing. For the loss of Liberty of Freedom of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
in Parliament, will soon and certainly be followed by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
loss of Liberty. Without failing in the respect which all
good Subjects owe unto the King, it may be said that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
ought to divest himself of all private inclinations, and force
his own Affections to yeild unto the publick concernments: And
therefore His Parliaments ought to inform him impartially, of
that which tends to the good of those they represent, without
regard of personal passions, and might worthily be blam'd, if
they did not believe, that he would forgo them all for the safety
of his people, Therefore if in it self it was lawful to propose a
Bill for excluding the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from the Crown, the doing
it after such an unwarrantable signification of his pleasure
would not make it otherwise. And the unusual stifnes which
the King hath shown upon this occasion, begins to be suspected
not to proceed from any fondnes to the Person of his Brother,
much less from any thought of danger to the English Monarchy
by such a Law, but from the influence of some few ill men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Royal Mind, who being Creatures to the Duke, or Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
to <hi>France,</hi> are restless to prevent a good understanding
betwen the King and his people; justly fearing that if ever he
comes to have a true sence of their affections to him, he would
deliver up to justice these wicked wretches, who have infected
him with the fatal notion, that the interests of his people are
not only distinct but opposite to his.</p>
            <p>His Majesty does not seem to doubt of his power in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with his Parliament, to exclude his Brother. He very
well know's this power hath been often exerted in the time of
his Predecessors. But the reason given for his refusal to comply
with the interests and desires of his Subjects, is, because it was
a <hi>point which concerned him so near in Honour, Justice and
Conscience.</hi> Is it not honourable for a Prince, to be True and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100673:16"/>
Faithful to his Word and Oath? To keep and maintain the
Religion and Laws established? Nay can it be thought disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
unto him, to love the safety &amp; wel-fare of his People
and the true Religion established among them, above the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Glory and Greatness of his personal Relations? Is it not
just, in conjunction with his Parliament, for his Peoples safety,
to make use of a power warranted by our English Laws, &amp; the
examples of former Ages? Or is it just for the Father of his
Countrey, to expose all his Children to ruine out of fondness
unto a Brother? May it not rather be thought unjust to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the Religion, Laws and Liberties of his People which he is
sworn to maintain and defend, and expose them to the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Rage of one that thinks himself bound in Conscience to
subvert them? If His Majesty is pleased to remember what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
the Duke professeth, can he think himself obliged in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
to suffer him to ascend the Throne, who will certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
to overthrow it, and set up the worst of Superstitions
and Idolatry in the room of it? Or if it be true that all, obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Honor, Justice and Conscience, are comprehended in a
grateful return of such benefits as have been received, can His
Majesty believe that he doth duly repay unto his Protestant
Subjects, the kindness they shewed him, when they recalled
him from a miserable helpless banishment, and with so much
dutiful affection placed him in the Throne, enlarged his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
above what any of his Predecessors had enjoyed, and gave
him vaster sums of Money in twenty years, than had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon all the Ks. since <hi>William</hi> the <hi>first;</hi> should he after
all this deliver them up to be ruin'd by his Brother? It cannot
be said that he had therein more regard unto the Government,
than to the Person, seeing it is evident the Bill of exclusion had
no ways prejudiced the legal Monarchy, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> his Majesty doth
now enjoy with all the Rights and Powers which his wise and
brave Ancestors did ever claim, because many Acts of the like
nature have passed heretofore upon less necessary occasions.</p>
            <p>The preservation of every Government depends upon an
exact adherence unto its Principles, &amp; the essential principle of
the English Monarchy, being that well proportioned distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Powers, whereby the Law doth at once provide for the
greatness of the King, and the safety of the People, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can subsist no longer, than whilst the Monarch enjoying
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100673:17"/>
the Power which the Law doth give him, is enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the part it allows unto him and the People are duly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
in their Rights and Liberties. For this reason our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
have been always more careful to preserve the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
inviolable, than to favour any Personal pretences, and
have therein conformed themselves to the practice of all other
Nations, whose examples deserve to be followed. Nay, we
know of none so slavishly addicted unto any Person or Family,
as for any reason whatsoever, to admit of a Prince who openly
professed a Religion contrary to that which was established
amongst them. It were easie to alledge multitude of examples
of those who have rejected Princes for reasons of far less weight
then difference in Religion, as <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Normandy, Charles</hi> of
<hi>Lorrain, Alphonso</hi> a <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sheradado</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> but those of a latter
date, against whom there was no other exception than for their
Religion, suiteth better with our occasion. Among whom it is
needless to name <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who though accomplished
in all the vertues required in a Prince, was by the general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of the Estate at <hi>Blois</hi> declared uncapable of succession to
the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> for being a Protestant. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his valour, industry, reputation and power increased
by gaining four great Battails, yet he could never be admited
King, till he had renounced the Religion, that was his obstacle.
And <hi>Sigismund</hi> Son of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> King of that Country by
Inheritance, and of <hi>Poland</hi> by Election, was deprived of his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Crown, and his Children disinherited only for being a
Papist, &amp; acting conformably to the Principles of that Religion,
though in all other respect he deserved to be a King and was
most acceptable unto the Nation.</p>
            <p>But if ever this Maxim deserved to be considered surely it
was in the case of the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> The violence of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
temper is sufficiently known: His vehemence in exalting
the Prerogative (in his Brothers time) beyond its due bounds
and the principles of his Religion which carry him to all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
excesses of cruelty, have convinced all mankind that he
must be excluded, or the Name of King being left unto him,
the power put into the hands of another. The Parliament there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
considering this, and observing the precedents of former
ages, did wisely choose rather to exclude him, than to leave
him the Name, and place the power in a Regent. For they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100673:17"/>
could not but look upon it as folly, to expect that one of his
temper, bred up in such principles in politicks, as made him in
love with Arbitrary power, and bigotted in that Religion,
which allewise propagates it self by Blood, would patiently bear
these shackles, which would be very disgustful unto a Prince of
the most meek disposition. And would he not thereby have been
provok't to the utmost fury and revenge, against those who
laid them upon him? This would certainly have bread a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
and these limitations of power proposed to keep up the
Government, must unavoidably have destroyed it, or the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(which necessity would have forced into a War in its own
natural defence) must have perished either by it or with it. The
success of such controversies are in the hand of God, but they
are undertaken upon too unequal terms, when the People by
victory can gain no more, than what without hazard may be
done by Law, and would be ruin'd if it should fall out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
The Duke with Papists might then make such a peace, as
the <hi>Romans</hi> are said to have made once in our desolated Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
by the slaughter of all the inhabitants able to make War,<note place="margin">Tacit.</note>
               <hi>&amp; ubi solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant.</hi> This is the happy state
they present unto us, who condemn the Parliament for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a Bill of Exclusion. This is the way to have such a
peace as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for the propagation of the Gospel made
in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> at the instigation of the Jesuites, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
their Councels. And seeing they have the Duke no
less under their power and directions, we may easily beleive
they would put him upon the same methods. But as it is not
to be imagined, that any Nation that hath vertue, courage and
strength equal unto the English, will so tamely expect their
ruine, so the passing a Bill to exclude him may avoid, but cannot
(as the Declaration phraseth it) establish a War. But if there
must be a War, let it be under the Authority of Law, let it be
against a banished excluded pretender. There is no fear of the
consequence of such a War. No true Englishman can joyn with
him, or countenance his Usurpation after this Act; and for his
Popish and forreign adherents, they will neither be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd,
nor more powerful by the passing of it. Nor will his
Exclusion make it at all <hi>necessary to maintain a standing force,
for preserving the Government, and the p<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ce of the Kingdom.</hi>
The whole People will be an Army for that purpose, and every
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100673:18"/>
Heart and Hand will be prepared to maintain that so necessary,
so much desired Law. A Law for which three Parliaments,
have been so earnest with His Majesty, not only in pursuance
of their own judgments, but by the direction of those that sent
them. It was the universal Opinion of the Papists, that <hi>Mary</hi>
Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> was excluded only by an Act of Parliament,
and yet we see Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Reigned Gloriously and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
forty years, without any standing force. But our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
do but dissemble with us, when they pretend to be so
much afraid of a standing Army. We know how eagerly they
have desired, and how often they attempted to establish one.
We have seen two Armies raised with no other design, as has
been since undenyably proved, and one of those they were so
loath to part with, that more than one Act of Parliament was
necessary to get it disbanded. And since that, they have increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Guards to such a degree, that they are become a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
standing force. A thing so odious to a free People,
that the raising of one single Regiment in <hi>Spain,</hi> within these
six years, under colour of being a guard for the Kings Person,
so inflamed the Nation, that a Rebellion had ensued, if they had
not been disbanded speedily. The Nobility and Gentry of that
Kingdom, looking upon themselves as their Kings natural
Guard, scorned that so honorable a Name should be given to
Mercenaries.</p>
            <p>But as His Majesty was perswaded to resolve against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
proposed, to secure our peace by excluding the Duke,
so it is evident that nothing was intended by those other ways,
which were darkly and dubiously intimated in His Majesties
Speech unto the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and repeated in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration;
and His Majesty in his Wisdom could not but know
that they signified nothing. And those who spake more plainly
in proposing a Regency as an expedient, did in publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
declare, they believed the Duke would not consent unto
it, nor unto any unusual restriction of the Royal Power. So
that they could have no other design therein, than a plausible
pretence to delude the Parliament and People. Some such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
induced them to revive the distinction between the
Kings personal and politick capacity, by separating the power
from the Person, which we have reason to believe they esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unseasable. However it is more than probable that the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100673:18"/>
Casuists,</hi> and Popish Lawyers would reject it, as well as
any thing else that might preserve us from falling under his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
And the <hi>Pope</hi> who could absolve King <hi>John, Henry</hi> the
third and others, from the Oaths they had taken, to preserve
the Rights and Liberties of their Subjects, might with the same
falicity dissolve any that the Duke should take. And as our
Histories restifie what bloody Wars were thereby brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Nation, we have reason to believe, that if the like should
again happen, it would be more fatal unto us, when Religion
is concerned which was not then in question. Would not his
<hi>Confessor</hi> soon convince him, that all Laws made in favour of
Heresie are void? And would he not be liable to the heaviest
Curses, if he suffered his power to be used against his Religion?
The little regard he hath to Laws whilst a Subject, is enough to
instruct us what respect he would bear to them if he should be a
King. Shall we therefore suffer the Royal Dignity to descend
on him, who hath made use of all the power, he has been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with hitherto, for our destruction? And who shall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
this great Trust? The next Heir may be an Infant, or one
willing to surrender it into his hands. But should it be otherwise,
yet still there is no hope of having any fruit of this expedient
without a War, and to be obliged to swear Allegiance to a Popish
Prince, to own his Title, to acknowledge him Supream Head of
the Church, and defender of the Faith, seems a very strange way
of Entitling our selves to fight with him.</p>
            <p>The two reasons which the Declaration pretends to give
against the exclusion, are certainly of more force against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.
<hi>A standing Force</hi> would have been absolutely <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
to have plac'd and kept the <hi>Administration in Protestant
hands; and the Monarchy it self had been destroy'd by a Law,</hi>
which was to have taken all sort of Power from the King, and
made him not so much as a <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> How absurdly and
incoherently do these men discourse? Sometimes the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is so Divine a thing, that no human Law can lessen or take
away his Right, who only pretends in Succession, and is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
but a Subject. But at other times they tells us of Acts of
Parliament to banish him out of his own Dominions, to deprive
him of all power, of his whole Kingship after he shall be in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the Throne. The cheat of this expedient appear'd so
gross in the House of Commons, that one of the Dukes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100673:19"/>
Vassals, who had a little more Honour than the rest, was
asham'd of it, and openly renounced the project which they had
been forming so long, and thought they had so Artificially disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
But though it was so well exposed in the House, yet the
Ministers thought the men without doors might be still deceived,
and therefore they do not blush to value themselves again upon it
in their Declaration.</p>
            <p>As for the insinuation which follow's, that there was reason
to beleive that <hi>the Parliament would have passed further to attempt
other great and important Changes at present.</hi> If it be meant any
change of the Constitution of the Government, 'tis a malicious
suggestion of those men, who are ever instilling into His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
mind ill thoughts of his Parliament, since no Vote nor
Proposition in either House could give any ground for such suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
and therefore in this matter the People may justly accuse
the Court, (who so often cry out against them for it) of being
moved by causeless Fears and Jealousies. And for His Maj<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sty
to be perswaded to Arraign the whole Body of his People, upon
the ill grounded surmises, or malicious and false suggestions of evil
and corrupt men about him, doth neither well become the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of a Prince, nor is agreeable to the measures of Wisdom;
which he should Govern himself, as well as Rule his People by.
And if an attendance to the slanderous accusations of Persons,
who hate Parliaments, because their Crimes are such that they
have reason to fear them, govern and sway his Royal mind,
there can never want grouds for the Dissolution of any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But if they mean <hi>by attempting great and important
Changes,</hi> that they would have besought His Majesty, that the
Duke might no longer have the Government in his hands, that
his dependents should no longer preside in his Councils, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
possess all the great Trusts and Offices in the Kingdom,
that our Ports, our Garrisons, and our Fleets should be no
longer governed by such as are at his Devotion, that Characters
of Honour and Favour should be no longer plac'd on Men, that
the Wisdom of the Nation hath judged to be Favourers of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
or Pensioners of <hi>France.</hi> These were indeed <hi>gre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t and
important Changes,</hi> but such as it becomes English men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
were designed by that Parliament. Such as will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
and prest for by every Parliament, and such as the People
will ever pray may at last find success with the King. Without
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100673:19"/>
these <hi>Changes,</hi> the Bill of Exclusion would only provoke, not
disarm our Enemies, nay the very Money which we must have paid
for it, would have been made use of to secure and hasten the Dukes
return upon us.</p>
            <p>We are now come to the consideration of that only fault
which was peculiar to the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that was
their behaviour in relation to the business of <hi>Fitz-Harris.</hi> The
Declaration says, <hi>he was impeached of High-Treason by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
and they had cause to think his Treasons to be of such an
extraordinary Nature, that they well deserved an Examination
in Parliament. For <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> a known <hi>Irish</hi> Papist appear'd
by the Informations given in the House, to be made use of by
some very great persons to set up a counterfeit Protestant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,
and thereby not only to drown the noise of the Popish
Plot, but to take off the Heads of the most eminent of those,
who still refused to bow their knees to <hi>Baal.</hi> There had been
divers such honest contrivances before, which had unluckily
fail'd, but the principal contrivers avoided the discovery, as the
others did the punishment; in what manner, and by what helps,
the whole Nation is now pretty sensible. Being warned by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
they grew more cautious than ever, and therefore that
the Treason which they were to set on Foot, might look as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
a Popish Design as was possible, they fram'd a Libel full of
the most bitter invectives against Popery and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
It carried as much seeming zeal for the Protestant Religion, as
<hi>Coleman</hi>'s <hi>Declaration,</hi> and as much care and concern for our
Laws, as the <hi>Penners</hi> of this <hi>Declaration</hi> would seem to have.
But it was also filled with the most subtile insinuations, and the
sharpest expressions against His Majesty that could be invented,
and with direct and passionate incitements to Rebellion. This
Paper was to be conveyed by unknown Messengers, to their
hands who were to be betray'd, and then they were to be seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon, and those Libels found about them, were to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the Truth of a Rebellion, which they had provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Witnesses to swear was designed by the Protestants, and had
before prepared men to believe by private whispers. And the
credit of this Plot should no doubt have been soon confirmed, by
speedy Justice done upon the pretended Criminals. But as well
laid as this contrivance seems to be, yet it spoke it self to be of a
Popish extraction. 'Tis a policy the Jesuites have often used<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:100673:20"/>
to divert a storm which was falling upon themselves. Accordingly
heretofore they had prepared both Papers and Witnesses, to have
made the <hi>Puritans</hi> guilty of the Gunpowder Treason, had it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
as they hoped for.</p>
            <p>The hainous nature of the Crime, and the greatness of the
Persons supposed to be concern'd, deserved an extraordinary
examination, which a Jury, who were only to enquire whether
<hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was guilty of framing that Libel, could never
make; and the Commons believed none but the Parliament was
big enough to go through with. They took notice that the
zeal or courage of inferiour Courts was abated, and that the
Judges at the Trial of <hi>Wakeman</hi> and <hi>Gascoign</hi> (however it came
to pass) behaved themselves very unlike the same men they
were, when others of the Plotters had been Tryed. They had not
forgot another Plot of this nature discovered by <hi>Dangerfield,</hi>
which though plainly proved to the Council, yet was quite
stifled by the great deligence of the Kings Bench, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
him as an incompetent Witness. Nor did they only fear
the perversion of Justice, but the misapplication of Mercy too.
For they had seen that the Mouths of <hi>Gadbury</hi> and others, as
soon as they began to confess, were suddainly stopt by a gracious
Pardon. And they were more jealous than ordinary in this
case, because when <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was inclined to Repentance
and had begun a Confession, to the surprize of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
without any visible cause, he was taken out of the lawful
Custody of the Sheriffs, and shut up a close Prisoner in the
<hi>Tower.</hi> The Communs therefore had no other way to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
that the Prosecution should be effectual, the judgment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
and the Criminal out of all hopes of a Pardon (unless
by an ingenuous Confession he could engage both Houses in
a powerful Mediation to His Majesty in his behalf) but by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching
of him, They were sure no Pardon could stop their
suit, though the King might release his own Prosecution by his
Pardon.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the Proceedings of the Commons in this business
could not be lyable to exception, for that they might lawfully
Impeach any Commoner before the Lords, was yet never doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Lords themselves had agreed that point, when the
day before they had sent down the Plea of Sir <hi>William Scroggs</hi>
to an Impeachment of Treason, then depending before them.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100673:20"/>
And they are men of strange confidence, who at this time of
day take upon them to deny a Jurisdiction of the Lords, which
hath been practised in all times without controul, and such a
fundamental of the Government, that there could be no securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
without it, Were it otherwise, it would be in the power of
the King, by making Commoners Ministers of State, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Government by their contrivances when he pleased.
Their greatness would keep them out of the reach of ordinary
Courts of Justice, and their Treasons might not perhaps be
within the Statutes, but such as fall under the cognisance of no
other Court than the Parliament; and if the People might not
of Right demand Justice there, they might without fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
act the most destructive villanies against the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>As a remedy against this evil,<note place="margin">Cap. 1. Sect. 2. pag. 9.</note> the <hi>Mirrour of Justice</hi> tells us,
that <hi>Parliaments were ordained to hear and determine all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of wrongful Acts, done by the King, Queen, or their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and such others against whom common Right cannot be had
elsewhere.</hi> Which as to the King, is no otherwise to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
than that if he erre by illegal personal Commands
or Orders, he is to be admonished by Parliament, and Addressed
unto for remedy, but all others being but Subjects, are to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by Parliaments, according to the Laws of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>If the ends were well considered for which Parliaments were
ordained, as they are declared in the Statute; <hi>Item for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the said Articles and Statues, (viz.</hi> Magna Charta,
&amp;c.) a Parliament shall be holden every year, by them as well
as by the forgoing ancient Authority,<note place="margin">36 Ed. 3. 10.</note> none could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the Parliament <hi>Rol.</hi> of 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Rot. Parl. 4 Ed. 3. Nu. 6.</note> Where it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
as accorded between the King and his Grands (that is
his Lords) that Judgement of death, given by the Peers
against Sir <hi>Simon de Beresford, Matrever,</hi> and others, upon the
Murder of King <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. and his Uncle, should not be drawn
into example, whereby the Peers might be charged to judge
others than their Peers, <hi>contrary to the Law of the Land, if such
a case should happen.</hi> For whereas from this Record, some
would perswade us that the Lords are discharged from judging
Commoners, and that our ancient Government is alter'd in this
case by that Record, which they say is an Act of Parliament.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100673:21"/>
The stile and form of it is so different from that which is used in
Acts of Parliament, that many are inclined to beleive it to be no
other thing, than an agreement between the King and the Lords.
But to remove all future scruples in the case, let it be admitted to
be an Act of Parliament, and if there be nothing accorded in it,
to acquit the Lords from trying Commoners Impeached before
them by the Commons in Parliament, then we hope that shame
will stop their mouths, who have made such a noise against the
Commons with this Record. <hi>First,</hi> it is evident from the Roll
it self with other Records, that the Lords did judge those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners
contrary to the Law of the Land, that is, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the King, and the Prosecution of their Enemies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the due course of the Law; or calling them to make their
defence, and (for ought appears) without legal Testimony.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> It is evident, that they were driven upon this illegal
proceeding, by the Power and Authority of the King, and some
Prosecutors, who earnestly pressed the Lords thereunto, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pretence of speedily avenging the blood of the former King
and his Uncle. So that the judgement was given at the Kings
suit, in a way not warranted by the Law and Custom of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or any other Law of the Kingdom. Surely when the
Lords blood was suffered to cool, they had reason to desire
something might be left upon Record, to preserve them for the
future from being put upon such shameful work, though such a
case as the Murder of a King should again happen, as it seems
they did not fear to be pressed in any other, so to violate the
Laws. But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is not a word in the Record, that
imports a restriction of that lawful Jurisdiction, which our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
placeth in the Lords to try Commoners, when their
cases should come before them lawfully, at the suit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
by Impeachment. There is no mark of an intention to
change any part of the ancient Government, but to provide
against the violation of it, and that the Law might stand as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
notwithstanding the unlawful Judgment they had lately
given. So that the question is still the same, whether by the
Law of the Land, that is the Law and Custom of Parliament, or
any other Law, the Lords ought to try Commoners Impeached
by the Commons in Parliament, as if that Record had never
been. And we cannot think that any man of sence, will from
that Record make an argument in this point, since it could be no
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100673:21"/>
better than to infer, that because the Lords are no more to be
pressed by the the King, or at his suit, to give Judgement against
Commoners contrary to the Law of the Land, when they are not
Impeached in Parliament, therefore they must give no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against them at the suit of the Commons in Parliament,
when they are by them Impeached, according to the Laws and
Customs of Parliament. But if such as delight in these cavils had
searched into all the Records relating unto that of the 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.
They might have found in the 19 of the same King,<note place="margin">Rot. Parl. <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Edw. 3. M. 18.</note> a Writ
issued out to suspend the Execution of the Judgment against <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trevers,</hi>
because it had been illegally passed. And the chief
reason therein given, is, that he had not been Impeached, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to make his defence. But it was never suggested nor ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
that the Lords who judged him, had no Jurisdiction
over him because he was a Commoner, or ought not to have
exercised it, if he had been Impeached. Nor was it pretended
that by <hi>Magna Charta</hi> he ought to have been tryed only by his
Peers; the Laws of the Land therein mentioned, and the Laws
and Customs of Parliaments, being better known and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced
in those dayes, than to give way to such a mistake.
They might also have found by another Record of the 26. of
the same King,<note place="margin">Rot Parl. 26 Edw. 3. M. 25.</note> that by undoubted Act of Parliament <hi>Matra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
was pardon'd, and the Judgment is therein agreed by the
Lords and Commons to have been illegal, and unjustly passed
by the violent Prosecution of his Enemies, but it is not alledged
that it was <hi>coram non judice,</hi> as if the Lords might not have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, if the proceedings before them had been legal. But
as the sence and proceedings of all Parliaments, have ever been
best known by their practice, The objectors might have found
by all the Records since the 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. that Commoners, as
well as Lords; might be, and have been Impeached before
Lords, and judged by them to Capital or other punishments,
as appears undenyably to every man that hath read our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
or Records. And verily the concurrent sence and practice
of Parliaments for so many Ages, will be admitted to be a better
interpretation of their own Acts, than the sense that these men
have lately put upon them to encrease our Disorders. But to
silence the most malicious in this point, let the famous Act of
the 25 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. be considered, which hath ever since limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all inferior Courts in their Jurisdiction, unto the Tryal of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100673:22"/>
such Treasons only as are therein particularly specified, and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all other Treasons to the tryal and judgment of Parliament.
So that if any such be committed by Commoners, they must be so
Tryed, or not at all. And if the last should be allowed, it will
follow that the same fact which in a Peer is Treason, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with death, in a Commoner is no Crime, and Subject to no
punishment.</p>
            <p>Nor doth <hi>Magna Charta</hi> confine all Trials to common Juries,
for it ordains that they shall be Tryed by <hi>the Judgement of
Peers, or by the Law of the Land.</hi> And will any man say the
Law of Parliament is not the Law of the Land? Nor are these
words in <hi>Magna Charta</hi> superfluous or insignificant, for then
there would be no Tryal before the <hi>Constable</hi> or <hi>Marshal,</hi> where
is no Jury at all. There could be no Tryal of a Peer of the
Realm upon an Appeal of Murder, who according to the Law,
ought in such cases to be tried by a common Jury and not by
his Peers.<note place="margin">Co. 2. Iust. 29.</note> And since the Records of Parliaments are full of
Impeachment of Commons, and no instance can be given of the
rejection of any such Impeachment, it is the Commons who have
reason to cite <hi>Magna Charta</hi> upon this occasion, which provides
expresly against the denyal of Justice. And indeed it looks like
a denyal of Justice, when a Court that hath undoubted Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance
of a Cause regularly brought before them, shall refuse to
hear it. But most especially, when (as in this case) the Prosecutors
could not be so in any other Court, so as a final stop was put to
their suit, though the Lords could not judicially know, whether
any body else would prosecute else-where.</p>
            <p>This proceeding of the Lords looks the more odly, because
they rejected the Cause, before they knew as Judges what it
was, and <hi>referred it to the ordinary Course of Law,</hi> without stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to hear, whether it were a matter whereof an inferior Court
could take Cognisance. There are Treasons which can only be
adjudged in Parliament, and if we may collect the sense of the
House of Commons from their debates, they thought there was
a mixture of those kind of Treasons in <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s case. And
therefore there was little reason for that severe suggestion, <hi>that
the Impeachment was only designed to delay a Trial,</hi> since a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
examination of his Crime could be had no where bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in
Parliament. But it seems somewhat strange, <hi>that the delaying
of a Tryal, and that against a professed Papist charged with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100673:22"/>
should be a matter so extreamly sensible:</hi> For might it not
be well retorted by the People, that it had been long <hi>a matter
extreamly sensible to them,</hi> that so many Prorogations, so many
Dissolutions, so many other Arts had been used to delay the
Trials, which His majesty had often desired, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
prepared for against five <hi>professed Popish Lords charged with
Treasons of an extraordinary nature.</hi> But above all, that it was
a matter <hi>extreamly sensible</hi> to the whole Kingdom, to see such
Un-Parliamentary &amp; mean Solicitations, used to promote this
pretended Rejection of the Commons Accusation, as are not
fit to be remembred. 'Tis there that the <hi>delay of the Tryal is to be
laid;</hi> for had the impeachment been proceeded upon, and the
Parliament suffered to Sit, <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tz-Harris</hi> had been long since ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted,
or deserved Mercy by a full Discovery of the secret
Authors of these malicious designs against the King &amp; People.
For though the Declaration says a <hi>Tryal was directed,</hi> yet we
are sure nothing was done in order to it, till above a month
after the Dissolution. And it hath since raised such questions, as
we may venture to say, were never talk't of before in <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Hall.</hi> Questions which touch the judicature of the Lords, &amp;
the Priviledges of the Commons in such a degree, that they will
never be determined by the decision of any inferior Court, but
will assuredly at one time or other have a farther Examination.</p>
            <p>We have seen now that the Commons did it not without some
ground, when <hi>they</hi> Voted <hi>the Refusal of the Lords to proceed
upon an Impeachment, to be a denial <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f Iustice, and a violation of
the Constitution of Parliaments;</hi> and the second Vote was but an
application of this Opinion to the present case. The third Vote
made upon that occasion, was no more than what the King
himself had allowed, and all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> had agreed
to be Law, in the case of the five impeached Lords, who were
only generally impeached, &amp; the Parliament Dissolved, before
any Articles were sent up against them. Yet they had been first
indicted in an Inferior Court, and preparations made for their
tryal, but the Judges thought at that time, that a prosecution of
all the Commons was enough to stop all prosecutions of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Nature. The Commons had not Impeached <hi>Fitz Harris,</hi>
but that they judged his case required so publick an Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and for any other Court to go about to try &amp; condemn him,
tho it should be granted to be for another Crime, is as far as in
them lies to stifle that Examination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:100673:23"/>
By this time every man will begin to question, whether <hi>the
Lords did themselves, or the commons Right, in the refusing to
countenance such a proceeding.</hi> But one of the penmen of this
Declaration has done himself and the Nation Right, and has
discovered himself by using his ordinary phrase upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
The Person is well known without naming him, who
always tells men they have done themselves no Right, when he
is resolved to do them none. As for the Commons, nothing
was <hi>carried on to extremity by them,</hi> nothing done but what was
Parliamentary? They could not desire a conference, till they
had first stated their own case, and asserted by Votes the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which they were to maintain at a conference. And so far
were those Votes from putting the Two Houses <hi>beyond a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Reconciliation,</hi> that they were made in order to it, and
there was no other way to attain it. And so far was the House
of Commons from thinking themselves to be out of a capacity
of transacting with the Lords any farther, that they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
to send a Message for a conference to accommodate this
difference, at the very instant that the Black Rod called them
to their Dissolution. If every difference in Opinion or Vote,
should be said to put the two Houses out <hi>of capacity of transacting
business together,</hi> every Parliament almost must be dissolved as
soon as called. However our Ministers might know well enough,
that <hi>there was no possibilty of Reconciling the Two Houses,</hi> because
they had before resolved <hi>to put them out of a capacity of transact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together by a suddain Dissolution.</hi> But that very thing justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the Commons to the world, who cannot but perceive that
there was solemn and good ground for them to desire an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
into <hi>Fitz Harris</hi>'s Treason, since they who influence our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
were so startled at it, that in order to prevent it, they first
promoted this difference between the two Houses, and then
broke the Parliament lest it should be composed.</p>
            <p>There is another thing which must not be past over without
observation, that the Ministers in this Paper take upon them to
decide this great dispute between the two Houses, and to give
iudgment on the side of the Lords. We may well demand what
Person is by our Law Constituted a Judge of their Priviledges,
or hath authority to censure the Votes of one House, made
with reference to matters wherein they were contesting with
the other House, <hi>as the greatest violation o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Constitution of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:100673:23"/>
They ought certainly to have excepted the power
which is here assumed of giving such a judgment, and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such a Charge, as being not only the highest violation of
the Constitution, but directly tending to the destruction of it.</p>
            <p>This was the Case, <hi>and a few days continuance being like to
produce a good understanding between the Two Houses,</hi> to the
advancing <hi>all those</hi> great and <hi>publick ends,</hi> for which the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hop'd they were called, the Ministers <hi>found it</hi> necessary to
put an end to that Parliament likewise.</p>
            <p>We have followed the Writers of the Declaration through
the several parts of it, wherein the House of Commons are
Reproached with any particular Miscarriages, and now they
come to speak more at large, and to give caution against two
sorts of ill Men. One sort they say, <hi>are men fond of their old
beloved Common-wealth Principles; and others are angry at being
disappointed in designs they had for accompl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shing their own Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Greatness.</hi> Surely if they know any such Persons, the
only way to have prevented the mischiefs which they pretend
to fear from them, had been to have discovered them, and
suffered the Parliament to Sit to provide against the evils they
would bring upon the Nation, by prosecuting of them. But if
they mean by these lovers of <hi>Common-wealth Principles,</hi> men
passionately devoted to the Publick good, and to the common
service of their Country, who believe that Kings were institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the good of the People, and Government ordained for
the sake of those that are to be governed, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
or grieve when it is used to contrary ends, every Wise &amp;
Honest man will be proud to be ranked in that number. And
if <hi>Common-wealth</hi> signifies the Common Good, in which sence it
hath in all Ages been used by all good Authors, and which
<hi>Bodin</hi> puts upon it, when he speaks of the Government of
<hi>France</hi> which he calls a <hi>Republick,</hi> no good man will be asham'd
of it. Our own Authors, <hi>The Mirror of Justice, Bracton,
Fleta, Fortescue,</hi> and others in former times. And of latter
years, Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> Secretary of State in the Reign of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in his Discourses of the Common-wealth of
<hi>England,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Bacon, Cook</hi> and others, take it in the
same sence. And not only divers of our Statutes use the Word,
but even King <hi>James</hi> in his first Speech unto the Parliament,
acknowledgeth hmself to be the <hi>Servant</hi> of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:100673:24"/>
and King <hi>Charles</hi> the I. both before and in the time of the War,
never expresseth himself otherwise. To be <hi>fond</hi> therefore of
such <hi>Commonwealth Principles,</hi> becomes every Englishman; and
the whole Kingdom did hope, and were afterwards glad to
find, they had sent such men to Parliament. But if the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
would intimate that there had been any design of setting
up a <hi>Democratical</hi> Government, in opposit on to our legal <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi>
it is a calumny just of a peice with the other things
which the penners of this Declaration have vented, in order to
the laying upon others the blame of a design to overthrow the
Government, which only belongs unto themselves.</p>
            <p>It is strange how this <hi>Word,</hi> should so change its signification,
with us in the space of twenty years. All <hi>Monarchies</hi> in the
World, that are not purely Barbarous and Tyrannical, have
ever been called <hi>Commonwealths. Rome</hi> it self altered not that
name, when it fell under the Sword of the <hi>Caesars.</hi> The proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and cruellest of Emperor disdained it not. And in our days,
it doth not only belong to <hi>Venice, Genoua, Switzerland,</hi> and
the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> but to <hi>Germany, Spain,
France, Sweden, Poland</hi> and all the Kingdoms of <hi>Europe.</hi> May
it not therefore be apprehended that our present Ministers, who
have so much decryed this <hi>Word</hi> so well known to our Laws, so
often used by our best Writers, and by all our Kings untill this
day, are Enemies to the thing? And that they who make it a
brand of Infamy to be of <hi>Commonwealth Principles,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to the good of the People, do intend no other than the
hurt and mischief of that People? Can they in plainer terms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their <hi>fondness</hi> of their <hi>beloved</hi> Arbitrary Power, and their
design to set it up, by subverting our Ancient Legal Monarchy
instituted for the benefit of the Commonwealth, than by thus
casting reproach upon those who endeavour to uphold it.</p>
            <p>Let the Nation then to whom the Appeal is made, judge
who are the men that endeavour to <hi>Poison</hi> the People, and who
they are who are guilty of designing innovations. <hi>Bracton</hi>
tells us that <hi>potestas Regis</hi> is <hi>potestas Legis:</hi> It is from the
Law that he hath his Power, it is by the Law that he is King,
and for the good of the people by whose consent it is made.
The Liberty and welfare of a great Nation, was of too much
importance to be suffered to depend upon the will of one Man.
The best and wisest might be transported by an excess of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
trusted with them, and the experience of all times showeth,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100673:24"/>
that Princes as men are subject to Errors, and might be misled. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(as far as mans Wit could foresee) our Constitution hath provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Annual Parliaments, 36. <hi>Edw. 3. cap.</hi> 10. that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
might receive no hurt; and it is the Parliament, that must from
time to time correct the mischiefs which dayly creep in upon us. Let
us then no longer wonder, when we see such frequent Prorogations and
Dissolutions of Parliaments; nor stand amazed at this last unparalell'd
effort of the Ministers by this Declaration to render two Parliaments
odious unto the People. They well know that Parliaments were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
to prevent such mischiefs as they design'd, and if they were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to pursue the ends of their institution, would endeavor to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
all things in their due order. To unite the King unto his People,
and the Hearts of the People unto the King: To keep the Regal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
within the bounds of Law, and perswade His Majesty to direct it to
the publick good which the Law intends. But as this is repugnant to
the introduction of Arbitrary Power and Popery, they who delight in
both, cannot but hate it, and chuse rather to bring matters into such a
state as may suit with their private interests, than suffer it to continue in
its right Channel. They love to fish in troubled Waters, and they find
all disorders profitable unto themselves. They can flatter the humor of
a misguided Prince, and encrease their Fortunes by the excesses of a
wastful Prodigal. The phrensie of an Imperious Woman is easily ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
propitious unto them, and they can turn the zeal of a violent bigot
to their advantage. The Treacheries of false Allies agree with their
own corruptions, and as they fear nothing so much as that the King
should return unto his People, and keep all things quiet, they almost
ever render themselves subservient to such as would disturb them. And
if these two last Parliaments according to their duty, and the trust repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in them, have more steddily than any other before them, persisted
in the Pious and Just endeavors of easing the Nation of any of its Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
the Authors of the Declaration found it was their best course, by
false colors put upon things, &amp; subtile misrepresentations of their actings
to delude the People into an abhorrence of their own Representatives,
but with what candor and ingenuity they have attempted it, is already
sufficiently made known. And if we look about us, we shall find those who
design a change, on either hand fomenting a misunderstanding between
the King, His Parliament and People, whilst persons who love the legal
Monarchy both out of Choice and Conscience, are they who desire the
frequent and successful meetings of the great Council of the Nation.</p>
            <p>As for the other sort of peevish men, of whom the Declaration gives
us warning, <hi>who are angry at the disappointment of their Ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs;</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:100673:25"/>
if these words are intended to reflect on those men of Honor
and Conscience, who being qualified for the highest employments of
State, have either left, or refused, or been removed from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they would not accept or retain them at the price of selling their
Country, and Enslaving posterity: And who are content to Sacrifice

to the malice of the men in power, and to the dayly Plots, Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

therefore it will be wisdom, to give such men as these no occasion to
say, that they intend to <hi>lay aside the use of Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In good earnest the behavior of the Ministers of late, gives but too
just occasion to say, that the <hi>use of Parliaments is already laid aside.</hi> For
tho His Majesty has owned in so many of His Speeches and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the great danger of the Kingdom, and the necessity of the Aid and
Counsel of Parliaments, he hath nevertheless been prevailed upon to
Dissolve four in the space of 26 Months without making provision by
their advice suitable to our dangers or wants. Nor can we hope the
the Court will ever love any Parliament better, than the first of those
four, wherein they had so dearly purchased such a number of fast
Friends; Men who having first sold themselves, would not stick to sell
any thing after. And we may well suspect they mean very ill at Court.
when their designs shock't such a Parliament. For that very <hi>Favourite</hi>
Parliament no sooner began in good earnest to examin what had been
done, and what was doing, but they were sent away in hast and in a
fright, though the Ministers know they lost thereby a constant Revenue
of extraordinary Supplies. And are the Ministers at present more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
than at that time: The same interest hath the ascendant at
Court still, and they have heightned the Resentments of the Nation,
by repeated affronts; and can we beleive them that they dare suffer a
Parliament now to Sit.</p>
            <p>But we have gain'd at least this one Point by the Declaration, that it is
own'd to us, <hi>that Parliaments are the best Method, for healing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
of the Kingdem, and the only means to preserve the Monarchy in
credit both at home and abroad.</hi> Own'd by these very men who have
so maliciously rendred many former Parliaments ineffectual, and by this
Declaration have done their utmost to make those which are to come
as fruitless, and thereby have confessed that they have no concern for
<hi>healing the distempers of the Kingdom, and preserving the credit of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;</hi>
which is in effect to acknowledge themselves, to be what the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100673:25"/>
Commons called them, <hi>Enemies to the King and Kingdom.</hi> Nothing can
be more true, then that the Kingdom can never recover it's <hi>strength and
reputation abroad,</hi> or its ancient Peace and Settlement at home, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
can never be releived from his fears and his domestick wants, nor
secure from the Affronts which he dayly suffers from abroad, till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
not only to <hi>call Parliaments,</hi> but to Hearken to them when they
are called. For without that, it is not a Declaration, it is not repeated
promises, nay it is not the frequent calling of Parliaments which will
convince the world, that the <hi>use of them is not intended to be laid aside.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However we rejoyce, that His Majesty seems <hi>resolved to have frequent
Parliaments,</hi> and hope he will be just to Himself, and us, by continuing
constant to this Resolution. Yet we cannot but doubt in some degree,
when we remember the Speech made 26 <hi>Jan.</hi> 1679. to both Houses,
wherein he told them, that he was <hi>Vnalterably of an Opinion, that long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
of Parliaments were absolutely necessary, for composing &amp; quieting the
minds of the People.</hi> Therefore, which we ought rather to beleive, the
<hi>Speech</hi> or the <hi>Declaration;</hi> or which is likely to last longest, <hi>a Resolution</hi> or
<hi>an unalterable opinion,</hi> is a matter too Nice for any but Court Criticks to
Decide. The effectual performance of the last part of the promise, will
give us assurance of the first. When we see the real fruits of these <hi>utmost
endeavours to extirpate Popery out of Parliament;</hi> when we see the D. of
<hi>York</hi> no longer first Minister, or rather Protector of these Kingdoms, and
his Creature's no longer to have the whole direction of Affairs; when we
see that Love to our Religion and Laws is no longer a crime at Court;
no longer a certain forerunner of being Disgr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>c'd and Remov'd from all
Offices and Employments in their Power wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the word Loyal (which
is faithful to the Law,) shall be restored to its old meaning, &amp; no longer
signifie one who is for subverting the Laws; when we see the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
fill'd with hearty Protestants, &amp; the Laws executed in good earnest
against the Papists, the Discoverers of the Plot countenanc'd, or at least
heard, and suffered to give their Evidence, the Courts of Justice steady
and not Avowing a Jurisdiction one day, which they Disown the next;
no more Grand Juries discharg'd, least they should hear Witnesses, nor
Witnesses hurried away, least they should inform Grand Juries; when we
see no more Instruments from Court labouring to raise Jealousies of
Protestants at home, and some regard had to Protestants abroad; when
we observe somewhat else to be meant by <hi>Governing according to Law,</hi>
then barely to put in Execution against Dissenters, the Laws made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Papists; then we shall promise our selves not only <hi>frequent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
but all the blessed effects of pursuing Parliamentary Counsels, the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100673:26"/>
               <hi>Extirpation of Popery, the Redress of Greivances, the flourishing of Laws,</hi> and the perfect
<hi>Restoring the Monarchy to the Credit, which is ought to have,</hi> (but which the Authors of
the Declaration confess it wants) <hi>both at Home and Abroad.</hi> There needs no time
<hi>to open the Eyes of His Majesties good Subjects, and their Hearts are ready prepared to meet
him in Parliaments, in order to Perfect all the good Settlement and Peace, wanting in Church
and State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whilst there are so many little Emissaries imployed to sow and encrease Divisions
in the Nation, as if the Ministers had a mind to make His Majesty the Head of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and joyn himself to one Party in the Kingdom, who has a just right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all (which <hi>Thuanm lib.</hi> 28. says, was the notorious folly, and occasioned the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of his great Grand Mother <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots)</hi> whilst we see the same
D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fferences promoted iudustriously by the Court, which <hi>gave the rise and progress to the
late troubles,</hi> and which were once thought fit to be buried in an Act of Oblivion.
VVhilst we see the Popish interest so plainly Countenanced, which was then done with
Caution; when every pretence of Pretogative is strained to the utmost Height, when Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laiments
are used with contempt and indignity, and their judicature, &amp; all their Highest
Priviledges brought in Question in inferior Courts, we have bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> too good cause to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that though every Loyal and Good man does, yet the Ministers and Favourites,
do but little <hi>consider the Rise and Progress of the late Troubles,</hi> and have little <hi>desire or
care to preserve their Country from a Relapse.</hi> And who as they never yet shewed <hi>regard
to Religion, Liberty or Property,</hi> so they would be little concern'd to see the <hi>Monarchy
shaken off,</hi> if they might escape the vengeance of Publick Justice, due to them for so
long a Course of pernicious Counsels, and for Crowning all the rest of their faults by
thus Reflecting upon that High Court, before which we do not doubt but we shall see
them one Day brought to Judgment.</p>
            <p>Thus have we with an English plainness, expressed our thoughts of the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and their Proceedings, as well as of the Court in Relation to them, and hope
this Freedom will offend no man. The Ministers, who may be concern'd through
their appealing unto the People, cannot in Justice deny unto any one of them the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of weighing the reasons which they have thought fit to publish in vindication of
their actions. But if it should prove otherwise, and these few sheets be thought as
weak and full of errors, as those we endevour to confute, or be held injurious unto
them, we desire only to know in, what we transgress, and that the Press may be open
for our justification; Let the People to whom the Appeal is made judge then between
them and us; and let Reason and the Law be the Rules, according unto which the
Controversie may be decided. But if by denying this, they shall like Beasts recurr to
force; they will thereby acknowledge that they want the Arms which belong to ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Creatures VVhereas if the Liberty of Answering be left us, we will give up the
Cause, and confess, that both Reason and Law are wanting unto us, if we do not in our
Reply satisfie all reasonable and impartial men that nothing is said by us, but what is
just, and necessary to preserve the interests of the King and his People. Nor can
there be any thing more to the Honour of His Majesty: than to give the Nations round
about us to understand, that the King of <hi>England,</hi> doth neither Reign over a Base,
servile People, who hearing themselves Arraign'd, and Condemned, dare not speak
in their own Defence and Vindication; nor over so silly, foolish and weak a People, as
that ill designed, and worse supported Paper might occasion the VVorld to think, but
that there are some Persons in his Dominions, not only of true English Courage, but of
greater intellectuals as well as better Morals, than the Advisers unto, and Penners of
the Declaration have manifested themselves to be.</p>
