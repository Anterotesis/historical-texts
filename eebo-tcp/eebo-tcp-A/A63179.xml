            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>But I can cite you three or four Books, and you have them all together in <hi>Rolls</hi> Abridgment, <hi>Title Challenge,</hi> where he ſets down four Books one after another, That it is no cauſe of Challenge, even to be the Kings Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and there is a great deal of reaſon for it. For if that were a good Cauſe of Challenge, mark the Conſequence, then all Perſons that hold Lands in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hold them mediately or immediately of the King, and ſo the King could have no Free-holders to be Jury-Men in his Cauſe.</p>

               <p>No, make out your Fact if you will have any benefit by it, 'tis only a Challenge to the favour, which ought not to be in the Kings Caſe. I am very glad that we are now to debate this matter with Men of the Robe, becauſe we have had a ſtrange ſort of Notions and Reflections ſpread abroad of late, as tho' the Judges now adays gave ſtrange ſort of Opinions, and as tho' Perſons that had been blemiſhes at the Bar, were preferred to do ſtrange things when they come upon the Bench; but truly I wonder to hear that it ſhould be a doubt, when at the ſame time that which we gave as our Opinion about one particular Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, that is as to Free-holders, it was the Judgment of all the Judges, That that was no Challenge, and all the Counſel that were concerned in that Caſe, know it was the Opinion of all the Judges. But now if we meet with Lawyers, I ſhall be glad to have the matter fairly argued and debated, and pray ſhew me what Law or Reaſon is for it.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Certainly my Lord, there is a great difference betwixt the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Allegiance of all Men, and ſo of a general tenure, and the dependance of any particular Perſon who is a menial Servant, and receives Wages of the King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>I would deſire to know of you Mr. <hi>Wallop,</hi> which is the greater Challenge, to ſay ſuch a one is Tenant, or ſuch a one is immediate Servant to <hi>J.S?</hi>

            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>There is a great difference, my Lord, I think, between an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Tenant, and the general tenure of all Subjects.</p>

               <speaker>L. <hi>Ch. Juſt.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>But certainly the Law is thus, if he were an immediate or a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Tenant to any but the King, if his Lord were party to the Suit it would be a good Challenge, but the being Tenant to the King is no good Challenge in the Kings Caſe.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I take it, the Act of Parliament that takes away the Court of Wards and Liveries, hath altered the Law as to that matter of Tenure; for now we hold in Socage, and that other Tenure is deſtroyed that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and his Subjects.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>But pray how comes it to be a Challenge now that was not one before? Does that Act of Parliament make it a good cauſe of Challenge? If it does, ſhew it. I tell you the Old Books are againſt it.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and Gentlemen, you that are ſworn, I am of Counſel for the King upon this Indictment. Gentlemen, the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſets forth, that the Defendant being a Seditious Malitious Evil diſpoſed Perſon, and Seditiouſly and Maliciouſly intending to diſturb the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the laſt day of <hi>June,</hi> in the 35. year of his now Majeſty's Reign, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other days and times, at the Pariſh of St. <hi>Giles</hi> in the Fields, in your County, did unlawfully aſſemble, and confederate himſelf with divers Evil-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Perſons, Subjects of our Lord the King, and then and there, with thoſe other perſons did Falſly Maliciouſly and Seditiouſly conſult and conſpire to make an Inſurrection in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and to provide Arms and Armed men in divers places of the ſaid Kingdom. And the better to compleat his Evil Intentions, the ſaid laſt day of <hi>June,</hi> did conſult and agree to ſend certain perſons, to the Jurors unknown, into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to invite ſeveral Evil-diſpoſed Perſons there to joyn in this Conſpiracy. This is the Subſtance of the Charge, and to this he ſays, He is not Guilty; If we prove him ſo, we do not queſtion but you will find it.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of this Jury, Mr <hi>Hambden</hi> ſtands Indicted of an High Miſdemeanour, for conſpiring with ſeveral others, to raiſe Rebellion within the Kingdom, and to crave the Aſſiſtance of the Brother-hood of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Upon the face of the Indictment, Gentlemen, it appears to be a very high Crime, and the matter of this indeed has been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in examination in other Tryals, and yet the Party you may obſerve do not acquieſce in thoſe Tryals, but think the Perſons accuſed lay under very great hardſhips, and that to a very great degree, as not having the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Counſel, nor to have their Witneſſes examined upon Oath; and therefore, Gentlemen, the King is pleaſed to go leſs in this Caſe than in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, That this Gentleman, who is now before the Court, may clear his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, if he has any Witneſſes to do it. And if there be any advantage that the having of Counſel can contribute to his Cauſe he has that allowed him too.</p>
               <stage>The Courſe of our Evidence, Gentlemen, will be this.</stage>
               <p>We ſhall prove to you that Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> with five other Perſons, (I ſhall name them) The Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sidney,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> they met ſeveral times, (the particulars we ſhall give you an account of) one was at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s houſe, another was at my Lords <hi>Ruſſels,</hi> where they did contrive together, and took upon them to be a Juncto or a Counſel of Six collected out of the wiſeſt men of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to conſider how they might better the Affairs of the Nation, and how they might make a Stir: For they thought there was no way poſſible o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of doing it, but by their joynt Counſels to carry on a Riſing. And that they might do it the Better, they reſolved to crave the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Gentlemen, We ſhall give you an account of their Conſults and Debates, and ſhall ſhew you, that at length they came to a Reſolution, That the riſing was to be carried on joyntly in <hi>London,</hi> and the ſeveral parts of the Kingdom, in ſeveral Countries at once. Then they came to think, and conſider whether it were not beſt to ſend into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to draw them in too. And thereupon it was agreed by this Juncto, That they would ſend thither, and the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it was committed to Mr. <hi>Sidney,</hi> to ſend ſome fit Perſon into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to treat with the Male-Contents there; and the better to carry on this joynt Deſign, ſome of them were to come up to <hi>London.</hi> And they were to have a pretence to treat about going to <hi>Carolina,</hi> and the purchaſing ſome Shares in the Plantation there, of which my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was a chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. We ſhall prove to you, Gentlemen, beſides all that I have opened, That the Perſon to whom that truſt was committed, Mr. <hi>Sidney,</hi> according to the Duty
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58199:4"/>
that he had taken upon him, does employ one <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> which all that know him, do know him to be a fit Engine for ſuch Counſellors, and a fit Inſtrument for ſuch a Conſpiracy. We ſhall prove he actually was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that he went into <hi>Scotland</hi> upon this Errand. And then we ſhall prove, That thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that were ſent to, and were the Perſons named in their Conſults to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, came here ſoon after to Town, and as ſoon as ever this Plot was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, they fled and abſconded themſelves. Gentlemen, If we ſhall prove all this matter to you, I think it will be without any Queſtion clear, that this Gentleman is notoriouſly Guilty of this High Miſdemeanour. And indeed, if you obſerve it, one of the Perſons has given Judgment againſt himſelf, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> But the Party have been ſo diligent and officious as to fling that upon the Government; but that matter we ſhall have before the Court in Judgment to morrow. For two of the others they have received the Judgment of the Law; for two more of them the King has been pleaſed to take them into his Mercy; the one is my Lord <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> who is ſummoned to appear here to day; the other is the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who has confeſſed all this matter, and has taken his Pardon, and we have Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned him alſo to be here this day; that the World, if they will have their Eyes opened (I mean the diſcontented World) may ſee there is nothing ſought but the Peace and Quieting of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, If we prove all this matter to you, I ſhall be glad to hear the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Counſel, and the Defence made by Witneſſes upon Oath.</p>

I did go and take a <hi>Subpoena</hi> from Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi>'s Order, and went to the Duke's Houſe at <hi>Moor Parke.</hi> When I came there, the outward Gate was locked, and I went to an Houſe where the Keys are kept, and having got the Keys, I went down to the Houſe, and I ſaw there one of his Servants fother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Cattle; and coming up to him, I asked him if the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was in the Houſe? He told me, he could not well tell, whether he was or not, but he thought he was gone to <hi>London,</hi> for he ſaw the Calaſh, and 5 or 6 Horſemen with it, and they ſaid in the Houſe, that it was the Duke that was gone to <hi>London.</hi> I asked if there were any Servants that were nearer to his Grace in the Houſe, that I might ſpeak with? They ſaid, Yes, there was the Houſe-keeper or Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, one Mr. <hi>Rawkins</hi> that attended upon the Duke. I deſired to ſpeak with him, and he came out to me; I asked him if the Duke was there? He ſeemed to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give me an anſwer. I asked him the ſecond time; but he did not ſay he was, or he was not. I told him then, I had a <hi>Subpoena,</hi> which I brought with me by Mr. <hi>Attorney General</hi>'s Order, to ſerve upon his Grace, which was to require him to attend here this day, to teſtifie his Knowledge in a Caſe between the King and Mr. <hi>Hambden.</hi> He told me, Sir, ſaid he, give me your <hi>Subpoena,</hi> and I will take care the Duke ſhall have it. He took it of me, and I came back to <hi>London</hi> preſently. Aſſoon as I came to Town, I had a ſecond <hi>Subpena</hi> given me to ſerve upon his Grace, with which I went to the Dukes Houſe at the <hi>Cock-pit.</hi>

               <p>

I told him I had a <hi>Subpoena</hi> to ſerve upon his Grace to appear as this day, the ſame as I ſaid at <hi>Moor Park.</hi> Says he, Mr. <hi>Atterbury,</hi> I will take care the Duke ſhall have it to night, or to morrow morning early.</p>

He lives in the <hi>Pall Mall,</hi> 'tis either his Houſe or his Lodging, but they call it his Houſe. I had a 3<hi>d Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poena</hi> given me to the ſame effect. And when I came there, I asked for the Duke, and a Woman came to the Door, Mrs. <hi>Manley</hi> (I think they call her) ſhe ſeemed to make little anſwer to what I ſaid. Said I, Pray will you give this <hi>Subpoena</hi> to the Duke, or to Mr. <hi>Row</hi> to give it the Duke? She took it of me, and ſaid, ſhe would give it Mr. <hi>Row</hi> certainly to give to the Duke. And yeſterday, or the day before, I met Mr. <hi>Row</hi> at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and ſays he to me, Mr. <hi>Atterbury,</hi> you brought a <hi>Subpoena</hi> to my Houſe a little while ago? Yes, Sir, ſaid I, I did, had you it? Yes, I had the <hi>Subpoena,</hi> ſays he. Then ſays I, I hope you gave the Duke it? To that he made me no anſwer, but nodded his head, and ſmiled, and went away.</p>

               <p>Yes, of the ſame ſide of the way. When I came there, there was my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> and I went together, Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> was then in the Room where they were. Afterwards came in my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> this made up ſix. When they were there, we fell into Diſcourſes—</p>

               <p>My Lord, After the diſappointment given to an Undertaking that was begun by my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> which was in <hi>October</hi> or <hi>November</hi> before, in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> he dyed. After that, truly I cannot ſay, but that Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> and my ſelf might be, and were the two firſt that did give the Riſe to it.

               <p>So much as I can give accompt of is this. It was about the day after <hi>Michale</hi>'s day that I came to my own Houſe having been before in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and that I think was <hi>Saturday.</hi> The <hi>Monday</hi> following Captain <hi>Walcott</hi> came to me and dined with me, and after Dinner told me My Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had left his Houſe, and had betaken himſelf to a private Lodging, and had hid himſelf from the reſt of his Friends; but had a great Kindneſs for me, (which Kindneſs truly I wiſh he had ſpared) and deſired to ſee me, I took time to conſider of it; but I bid him go back to my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and tell him if he had any thing of an extraordinary Nature to acquaint me with, I would come and aſſiſt him all I could. He came the next day again and ſhewed me to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Lodgings: He lodged then at one <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s Houſe a Citizen, I know not what Street they call it; but it was in a little Street down by <hi>Wood-ſtreet.</hi> And when I came to him, I found my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> very much differing from what he uſed to be, which was more cautious, and preſently he fell to tell me that he was forced to withdraw himſelf from his own Houſe, for fear of being attacked again by Sham-Charges and Plots, and falſe Evidence as he had before: For now he ſaid, He ſaw they had the Poſſeſſion of all Juries by having thoſe <hi>Sheriffs</hi> which were impoſed upon the City, as he ſaid, and he could not think his own life or any Mans Life ſafe; for to be accuſed was ſufficient to bring his Life into very great danger, and for that Reaſon he had with drawn himſelf to that private retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and being there he was reſolved to make ſome ſpeedy Puſh for recovering of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> that there was Preparation made in the City of ſeveral 1000 of Men that were all in Readineſs to Riſe, and that for his part he was reſolved to be ſet on Horſe-back; for get on Horſe-back he could not; and that there were great numbers that were ready when he did but hold up his Finger to be drawn together at any time: That divers had been drawn out of the Country to joyn with them by inſenſible parties of Horſe, I think he named about fourſcore or an hundred. Which ſince I found were to be headed by Col. <hi>Romſey</hi> upon the day of making and declaring the <hi>Sheriffs</hi>; but finding there was nothing done, he withdrew himſelf and his Man thither; but there was ſuch a general Preparation in the City, that if ſome Lords did not unhandſomely deſert them they ſhould be in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs for Action quickly. I askt him who he meant? He told me, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had very unhandſomely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted him; for they had promiſed and undertaken to be in Readineſs with Men out of ſeveral Countreys in which they had an Intereſt, he named <hi>Somerſetſhire, Devonſhire,</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> I think, and that my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> ſhould be diſpoſed of into <hi>Eſſex</hi> to do the ſame there, and if they had held on this Reſolution it had been ſuch a ſure Game that it could not have failed: But ſays he, they are ſtarted, and ſay they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in Readineſs to do it. My Lord, I very much wonder that thoſe Perſons you named ſhould ingage in any Deſign, and fail of performing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58199:6"/>
what they promiſed! Says he, I'll aſſure you 'tis ſo. And ſo he proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſpeak ſeveral ſharp things of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Ambition, that he thought to have all under his Command: Which was a Secret lurking Ambition in him, that he ſaid, he always ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Duke to be guilty of. And now he found his ſuſpitions true. That unleſs he might Command all, he would do nothing. But for his part ſince he found the matter ſo, he was reſolved to go on alone rather than fail in his Deſign. Said I, my Lord, I ſhould be very forward to concurr with you in any thing; but I wonder your Lordſhip ſhould ſtep into an Action of ſuch danger thus divided from thoſe that are moſt likely to aſſiſt you in it. I cannot help it, ſaid he, I have left my Houſe and muſt go on. My Lord, ſaid I, pray give me leave to go to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and expoſtulate the matter with him and I will come and give you an accompt again. Says he, 'tis to no purpoſe, I dare ſay. Said I, my Lord, pray let me go and try, for I would not have you divided, but I will promiſe you this, I will not tell him I come from you, but as from my ſelf diſcourſe it with the Duke. Well, ſaid he, if you will you may. This was upon <hi>Tueſday,</hi> I think the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> or 4<hi>th.</hi> So I went to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> the next day which was <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> and finding him not at home at his Houſe in <hi>Sohoe,</hi> and being told he was at <hi>Moor-Park,</hi> I took an Occaſion to go to <hi>Moor-Park,</hi> and I came there a little after Dinner, and took him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and told him all this that I now have ſpoken about my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> Says he, I think the Man is mad, What does he mean? We did undertake to do this 'tis true; but not by that time he ſpeaks of, and things are not ready, I know not what his own Fears make him do; but he does act ſo prepoſterouſly that he will undo us all. Said I, my Lord, all that I ſhall deſire is, that there may be an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view betwixt you, and diſcourſe the thing with one another, or elſe it may be a thing of very fatal Conſequence for him to ſtep into an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this danger and concern while you are thus divided. With all my Heart, ſays the Duke, I would have nothing more, I deſire to ſpeak with him. This made me recoil back again to my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> the next day, and I told him all this, and deſired he would give a meeting, ſays he, I ſee they are falſe then to ſay they did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, they were engaged, and that againſt this time too, the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Swearing of the Sheriffs; and now for me to meet with them, I know I ſhall run out into Paſſion and Anger, and therefore 'tis better omitted. Said I, my Lord, I muſt poſitively inſiſt upon it. I muſt have an interview between you, for 'tis a Madneſs for you to go on thus divided in ſo great a Buſineſs. I could not prevail, he would not; but he told me, if I would I might go to them from him, and let them know I had been with him; (for before I pretended to have it from a third hand, and not from my Lord himſelf,) and if they would be in a Readineſs with what they promiſed from the Countrey, he would ask nothing from the City, he would take that place upon himſelf, if they would perform their engagement for other Parts; but he reſolved to go on. So I went to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s again, and told him, what he ſaid, That I could not by any means get him to an interview. Says the Duke, he is a ſtrange Man, I know not what to do with him, we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58199:6"/>
will all be in Readineſs aſſoon as we can; but it is impoſſible to do it ſo ſoon. I went to my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> again on the <hi>Saturday,</hi> and did then poſitively engage him that he would give a Meeting to me, and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and ſome others. And we appointed time and place, he appointed to come out in a Parſons Habit, and a black Perrywig to his own Houſe, which he thought the ſafeſt place, becauſe he would not diſcover his Lodging to any of them for fear it ſhould come to be known. With theſe Inſtructions I came to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to prepare him about it, and proffered him to be ready the next day at Evening with my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> to go to him. All this while I had not ſpoken to my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> but only to the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi> And the next day when I came from Church to my own Houſe, there met me a Meſſage from Colonel <hi>Romſey,</hi> who I underſtood by my Servants had been there, and left his Name. With this Meſſage, that he came to tell me the Gentleman that was to meet could not meet. This was ſo confuſed a matter that I was Impatient till I knew the meaning of it. I took my Coach and went directly to the Duke of <hi>Monmouths</hi> again, and he told me Colonel <hi>Romſey</hi> had been with him and told him, my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was apprehenſive there were a great many <hi>Tories</hi> about his Houſe, and he feared being diſcovered, and therefore had remov'd his Lodging, and ſo could not meet; but we ſhould hear from him in two or three days. So that was the laſt time that I ſaw my Lord of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> or indeed in a direct Line did hear from him; collaterally by <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cott</hi> I did afterwards hear; but by this means we were at a loſs. After this the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did tell me (for he did not own to me that he ſaw him, but indeed ſwore to me he did not ſee him; but I find ſince he (did. That he would do what he could to prevent any untimely dangerous undertaking. But after this it ſeems they had a Meeting at Mr. <hi>Shepherds</hi> Houſe, where my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſent a Meſſage to him and my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>; but the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> only told me that my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had met with him, and ſeen him; but he never owned that he had met him himſelf, or ſeen him. About four or five days after, Captain <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cott</hi> came to me, and told me ſuch a day was ſet for the Riſeing. Upon which being ſtartl'd, I had nothing to do, but recoyl back to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and endeavour to ſtop any raſh Proceedings, and it was ſtopped as I thought, and ſo it continued for two or three days, and at that time, which was in <hi>October</hi> there was a Rumor up and down whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered as if ſomething would be attempted; but what it was we did not know, but thus it went on for two or three days, and then it meeting with a diſappointment upon the Conſultation at Mr. <hi>Shepherds,</hi> my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> took up his Reſolution to be gone, and went away to <hi>Holland,</hi> and dyed in <hi>Holland.</hi> This is the Subſtance of that accompt which I can give of thoſe former Tranſactions.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Howard,</speaker>
               <p>This was in <hi>November.</hi> After this there being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Conferences between Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> and me; for Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> by the way knew nothing of all this, and I was caution'd by my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> that I ſhould not tell my Friend <hi>Sidney</hi> any thing of it, and asking him the reaſon, why I ſhould not? Says he, I can't well tell;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58199:7"/>
but you will wonder when I tell you that his own Friend <hi>Major Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> has barred him and would not let him know it. The Gentleman is now dead; but I will aſſure you he did know nothing of this for a Month after: For he was gone into the Countrey; but after my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was dead, I told him the Hiſtory of all theſe Tranſactions, which he was before a Stranger to. After this, when I had acquainted him with what had been intended in <hi>London,</hi> and what Preparations had been made, and how what was intended had been ſuppreſſed, and in what poſture affairs then ſtood. We then took up a Reſolution to form a Council that might for the time to come give ſuch Directions as might regulate the Motions of this Affair. Thereupon we began to think of the Perſons who they ſhould be. He undertook to ſpeak to my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> and I was to bring the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to a right Underſtanding with him in it. So I went to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and told him Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> did preſent his Service to him, and would willingly wait on him, but that he thought it would do him hurt, becauſe he was a perſon of ſuch Note, and thereupon ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious that it might prejudice him to have him ſeen to come to him; and therefore if his Grace would pleaſe to appoint any third place, he ſhould be very glad to kiſs his Hand. Says the Duke, I do not know any where truly to appoint. Why then, ſaid I, I will tell you a place: Let us e'en go to his Houſe (having before prepared Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> for it) and take him by Surpriſe and dine with him, and then there will be the leſs Suſpicion. But, ſaid I, you muſt not expect to be treated as the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> becauſe he does not expect you; but take him as a Philoſopher, and dine with him as he uſes to dine at his own Table. Says the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> I care not for Entertainment; I will go with you: And there at that time did the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> undertake to bring in my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Salisbury.</hi> This was the only Diſcourſe preparatory to it that ever I knew of. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Fortnight or three Weeks after; nay, I think it was leſs than Ten Days after, Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> came to me, and told me, my Lord of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> was very forward in it. The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would prepare my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Salisbury</hi>; and he himſelf did not doubt but Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> was very willing to be in it too; and they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Meeting at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s Houſe, and he would carry me thither to the Houſe; and this was the firſt Meeting that I knew of; and there we met all Six.</p>

               <p>When we came there every one diſcourſed what he would. There was a Diſcourſe of the Time and Places where to riſe; but among other things it was reſolved as a principal Point, that there ſhould be a Preparation made for the Deſign, by a Treaty with thoſe of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and an Underſtanding ſetled with <hi>Argyle,</hi> and a Meſſenger ſent to my Lord <hi>Argyle</hi> and others.

               <p>Pray, my Lord, as near as you can remember, will you give an Account what was the thing he began to diſcourſe of? Did he ſeem to take any Notice, or have any Knowledge of your Meeting, and other things before?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Howard,</speaker>
               <p>It was a general Hint and Intimation to us of the Ends of our Meeting, that we were there come to conſult and adviſe one with another how to put things into a better Method and Poſture than formerly: And he deſired that we would ſit down and diſcourſe of theſe things.

               <speaker>Lord Howard,</speaker>
               <p>Thoſe were ſtarted ſeverally. Some would ſpeak of the Time when it ſhould be, whether it were not convenient now or when? Others offered ſomething concerning the Places, whether it ſhould be begun in the City or in the Country, or both together. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers took it into Conſideration what Perſons were to be prepared in the ſeveral Countreys to be aſſiſting in it that were probable to carry it on. And then ſome diſcourſed concerning the raiſing of Money, and then what ſumm ſhould be raiſed, and I think that was ſtarted by the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>; but I am ſure the ſumm that he named was 20 or 30000 <hi>l.</hi> The laſt thing that was talked of, but which was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be the thing principally to be taken care of, was the ſetling ſuch a Concurrence and Correſpondence with <hi>Scotland</hi> that they might chime in at the ſame time, that ſo we might give as many diverſions both from home and abroad as could be at one and the ſame time.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Howard,</speaker>
               <p>There was I cannot ſay a Complaint, becauſe there was no Perſon to complain to; but it was ſpoken of as a matter of great grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58199:8"/>
that ſuch a Force and Violence ſhould be put upon the City in their Election of Officers, and the tendency of that as to all Juryes tho' I cannot diſtinctly remember the particular things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>That there ſhould be one only at that time. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it was the matter of the debate at the next Meeting, which was that Meeting at my Lord <hi>Ruſſels,</hi> which was about this time twelve-month in <hi>February</hi> ſometime.</p>

               <p>Then we came to a Reſolution that ſome Body ſhould be ſent, and we began to diſcourſe who was ſit, and Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> he propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> to ſome of the Company he was known, to others not; but thoſe that did know him did approve of him as a fit Perſon.</p>

               <p>Yes, no body did oppoſe it; but left it to him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Howard,</speaker>
               <p>He was not ſo named as to be with any ſolemnity appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or diſproved; but it was left to Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> to manage it, and he naming <hi>Smith</hi> as a fit Perſon (he told us that by the by not to put it to the Queſtion for our Approbation) and ſome of us knew the Perſon, others did not.

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Howard,</speaker>
               <p>About three or four days after this Meeting at my Lord <hi>Ruſſels,</hi> I went to Viſit Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> at his Houſe, and while I was there in the Room, he went to his Cabinet, and out of a Drawer where there was five or ſix hundred pound in Gold as I could gueſs, he took a good many pieces, I do not know directly how many; but he took out ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as he ſaid was threeſcore Guineys that he was going to carry to <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> I went not in my own Coach, and therefore went away with him in his Coach, and he ſet me down at <hi>Southampton Street</hi> at my own Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I went no further, but he did, and he told me afterwards it was conveyed to him, and that he did go.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Howard,</speaker>
               <p>I think it may be leſs then a Week, four or five days, that I ſaw him carry the Money. After this he ſaid, he had given him this Money, and was gone: And when he was diſpatched, in a Week after I was making enquiries after him, and Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> ſaid, he had not heard of him ſince he went away; but about a fortnight or three Weeks Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> ſaid he had heard of him, That he was at <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> and ſtay'd there; but he wondered he could hear no more of him. I then went into <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> and when I came back from thence, he told me, he was come, but I had never ſeen him, not to this day, indeed I had once appointed a Meeting with him at Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi>'s Chamber; but ſomething or other happened, we did not meet.</p>

               <p>My Lord, about the beginning of <hi>July, Fourth, Fifth,</hi> or <hi>Sixth,</hi> or thereabouts, I had ſome Information, That there were ſome <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen that had been ſhifting up and down, and at that time were about <hi>Black-Fryers,</hi> lodged there ſecretly. I immediately went with the King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and ſome Warrants that I had to apprehend ſome Traytors that were fled: And when I came, I found that Mr. <hi>Common Serjeant</hi> having Notice of them, had beat up their Quarters, and they were endeavouring to eſcape by Water; but there they were catched. There was Sir <hi>Hugh Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> and <hi>Bayley,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Campel,</hi> and ſome others, I know not the Names of them all; truly I can't tell whether <hi>Monrow</hi> was not another, but Sir <hi>Hugh Campel</hi> I had in my Cuſtody, and <hi>Bayley</hi> was immediately committed to the <hi>Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi>; and the reſt of the Gentlemen I afterwards took in a cunning Hole by <hi>Moor-Fields,</hi> in a back houſe. And when I came there, I found them lyeing on the Bed in the middle of the Day; and had them Priſoners in my Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy two or three Months; and then they were all ſent out of my hands into <hi>Scotland</hi> Priſoners. Six of them there were, my Lord, that I ſaw.</p>

            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am of Counſel for Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> the Defendant upon this Indictment here before you. This Indictment is a ſevere Indictment: It is a very high Crime of which my Clyent is Accuſed. How far the Evidence tends to reach it, you have heard; and I ſhall, with the patience of the Court, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly obſerve it to you. But I ſhall firſt ſpeak to the Indictment it ſelf: It ſaies, that Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> being a perſon of a turbulent Diſpoſition, and Seditiouſly intending to diſturb and diſquiet the King's Peace, and to ſtir Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and to bring the Government into danger, did Conſpire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to this matter, Gentlemen, there is no manner of Proof of what the Indictment charges, as to the Diſpoſition of the perſon Accuſed; nor that he had any other deſign, than what my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> hath now Sworn. Then it ſaies further, that Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> did Conſult and Conſpire with divers perſons to execute theſe purpoſes; and particularly for the making and raiſing of an Inſurrection in the Kingdom. This is laid as the particular Fact: And for this purpoſe, he did further Conſpire with ſeveral perſons, to provide Armes and Armed-men: And for their fulfilling of this, he did further Conſult with ſeveral perſons, that ſome perſons ſhould be ſent into <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſtir up the Kings Subjects in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to a Concurrence and Conjunction with ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>England,</hi> about this his evil deſign. How far this Indictment is prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon the Defendant, Gentlemen, is the Queſtion before you. He has plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Not Guilty, and hopes to ſatisfy you he is not. Gentlemen, as to what Evidence has been given you ſo far as 'tis Poſitive, and Affirmative; I mean the Teſtimony of my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> in that part, it is impoſſible for us that are of Counſel for the Defendant directly to contradict him with Proof, or to give a direct poſitive proof in anſwer to it: I ſay 'tis impoſſible for us to contradict him, who gives ſuch a poſitive Evidence of Fact. By the Evidence of my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> he tells us there were Six Perſons in this Council, as he is pleaſed to call them. By his Evidence, three of the ſix are dead, my L. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Col. <hi>Sidney,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>; He himſelf is the Fourth, the Defendant is the Fifth, who cannot give Evidence for himſelf; and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who is the Sixth, being away, there is not any perſon in being, that ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Affirmative in this part of his Evidence but the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>: Whom we cannot have here, ſince it appears by the Evidence Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi> could not prevail to have him at this Tryal; therefore proof of that nature cannot be reaſonably expected from my Clyent, to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by a poſitive Contradiction of what my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> has ſworn. Then in this Caſe we muſt, as in all Caſes where a perſon does Swear directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Defendant, endeavour to ſatisfie and perſwade your Lordſhip and the Jury upon Circumſtances ariſing out of this Fact, and further Circumſtances attending the Fact, and by probable Arguments and reaſonable Inductions out of the Evidence, that this Gentleman, the Defendant, is not guilty of what he is charged with.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, we ſhall obſerve upon the Teſtimony of my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> that as to ſome things he is very Poſitive, and Particular: He has an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Memory, and ſpeaks particularly to Perſons, particularly to Places, particularly to Times. But Gentlemen, as to that which is the principal part of his Evidence, and which moſt affects the Defendant, and wherein it concernes us to contradict or diſprove him, he is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to that Circumſtance of Time. He that is ſo exact in his Memory as to other Circumſtances, is not poſitive, nor any thing like poſitive, as to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58199:11"/>
Times of the Meeting. For they would imagine, that the firſt Meeting the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was concerned in, was at his own houſe. He deſcribes the Houſe and the Place very exactly, but as for the Time, he only ſayes it was about the middle of <hi>January</hi>: He carries other things in his memory poſitively; and whether it might not be expected in a Caſe ſo remarkable as this, and which ſo nearly and highly concerned himſelf, that he ſhould be as particular in the Time, as he is in other things, you may rationally judge. His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſometimes is very particular as to Time: He tells you in his Relation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my Lord <hi>Shaftſbury,</hi> that his going to him, was on the <hi>Saturday</hi> after <hi>Michaelmaſday</hi>; and then he purſues it to the Second and Third of <hi>October.</hi> He is poſitive to many ſeveral Days; upon which I would obſerve, that he being particular to a Day, as to other things, may well be expected to be ready, (if it be true,) to be as particular as to the Time of this Meeting: But therein he is to ſeek; he is doubtful as to that. And you muſt give us leave Gentlemen, to make this Obſervation, That ſince he will not be particular to that Time, we do apprehend that he gives himſelf a little Looſe, that we may not meet with him to contradict him in that Circumſtance: For if he ſhould be poſitive therein, as he is in the other matters that concern not the Defendant, we might perhaps by clear pregnant Circumſtances contradict, if not diſprove his Lordſhip, that it is not probable, (if poſſible,) it ſhould be true what he affirmes. But Gentlemen, we muſt anſwer it as well as we can; and ſince he is ſo Cautious, we muſt meet him by Arguments in another way. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing we ſhould obſerve upon my Lords Evidence, is this; That my Lord, tho he be particular as to many Facts and things relating to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> where he names other particular Perſons, I think Coll. <hi>Romſey</hi> and <hi>Walcot,</hi> and names the particular Diſcourſes, particularly inſtancing in them between him and my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> between him and <hi>Walcot,</hi> and between him and other Perſons; yet he has not made uſe of any one Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Fact in this Caſe of the Defendant's now before you, that does juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy what he has ſaid, ſave only that of <hi>Aaron Smith</hi>; not any one Circumſtance of Fact. So that there is no more than the bare Saying of what my Lord <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> is pleaſed to deliver no more than his Oath, nay, no more than his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and Inference of much of what paſſed in the Company of ſeveral perſons, without any concurring Circumſtances in Fact to Juſtify or Confirm his Teſtimony. It might have been an eaſy matter, if all that my Lord <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> ſayes was true, that there was ſuch a Meeting at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s Houſe by ſuch and ſuch Perſons, to prove that ſuch Perſons, or ſome of them, met there. But that there ſhould be no Perſon to prove, that theſe Gentlemen, or any of them, were there; nor any other Fact or Circumſtance in the world, to go along with my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> to juſtify his Aſſeveration, is very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and may well make it doubtful that it ſhould not be true: And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentlemen, (if it be true as my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> would have it) becauſe there was a ſecond Meeting of all theſe perſons at my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s, which was ſo publick and open a place, and yet no man to Concur or go along with my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> in any one thing; no particular Fact aſſigned to juſtify his Teſtimony as to this Meeting, is ſtrange, if it be true.</p>
               <p>So then Gentlemen, there is no more than what my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> has Sworn, without any one Circumſtance to back it, to prove the Defendant Guilty. My Lord, taking this upon the main of my Lord <hi>Howards</hi> Evidence, it will be pretty hard too upon the nature of the Fact, that he is pleaſed to prove againſt this Gentleman, to make an Anſwer to it: And truly, I think as hard for you to believe it. Gentlemen, He would imagine, That there ſhould be men Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, men Armed, a diſcourſe of Money, and this done, as he would have it, about the middle of <hi>January</hi>; and yet nothing at all done, though there
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58199:11"/>
appears no manner of Diſcovery of this very evil Contrivance, till about <hi>July.</hi> Neither is there any thing done in order to the Raiſing of Men, the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Men, or the levying of Money all this while. So that there is no one Fact of any kind whatſoever, that goes along with what my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> has ſaid.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen, Another thing we would deſire to obſerve, is this, and here we ſhall begin with what we have to ſay, as to our own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Circumſtances, that we have to take off from the Teſtimony of my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> in this caſe: In the firſt place, it appears by the Evidence of my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> That he was very deep in a Conſpiracy againſt the Government, and to make a diſturbance in the Kingdom long before this, that he now ſpeaks of againſt the Defendant, that is plain enough; for he tells you, That my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> and <hi>He</hi> at <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> were contriving of Projects to Overturn the Government, and raiſe a Rebellion. It appears plainly by his Evidence, That my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> when he left his houſe, was reſolved upon it, and my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was very Solicitous to carry on the ſame Deſign; nay, he was ſo Active in it, that he tells you, That he did create Meſſages between my Lord of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and would needs go by a falſe inſinuation of his own, to draw in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> by telling his Grace his Information he had from <hi>Walcot,</hi> and not ſaying he came from my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> with whom he ſays he had been diſcourſing; but he would put it under ſome ſort of Diſguiſe, the better to prevail. So that it appears, my Lord was very Criminal, and Guilty, in this Caſe. Why then Gentlemen, my Lord being ſo highly Criminal, and there being a Diſcovery of this Conſpiracy by <hi>Keiling,</hi> and <hi>Romſey,</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a more manifeſt Diſcovery, and this happening in <hi>July,</hi> Then it was high time my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> might conceive for him to Secure himſelf, and ſave one, he being thus Guilty, as he declares: It is but reaſonable to conjecture, he then began to place his Security in a Pardon; and that there were no other means to ſave his Life; and that the way to it, muſt be by ſome further Diſcovery of a Conſpiracy againſt his Majeſty and the Government: And having ſince obtained a Pardon, it is agreeable, That whatſoever my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> has done in this Caſe, he has done for his own ſake, to purchaſe his own Pardon for a Treaſon he was ſo deep in, and to out-do all the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that went before him, by freſh Teſtimony againſt the Defendant and others: This might incline him to go an Inch or two, or more, beyond the Diſcovery of <hi>Keiling, West,</hi> and <hi>Romſey</hi>; to have but ſaid the ſame thing that was proved by Three or Four Witneſſes before him, might not perhaps have availed him: may not the indifferent believe it in this Caſe, to be the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Security of my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> by theſe means to merit his Pardon? May it not be believeable, that what he hath ſaid, he hath ſaid only for his own ſake, and that he has, by expoſing this Gentleman, and the Blood of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, procured himſelf a Pardon?</p>

               <p>My Lord, I intend nothing of hardſhip, or amiſs, but to ſpeak
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58199:12"/>
according to my Inſtructions, and to make the beſt Obſervations I can out of the Evidence for my Clyent: I will expreſs my ſelf as well as I can, That my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> being a Witneſs againſt Men in a Caſe of this high Nature; and there being other Witneſſes before, and beſides himſelf, to the Diſcovery of the late Conſpiracy againſt the Government, it concerned him to give an home Evidence in the Caſe, or elſe he could not have any expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Pardon: For if he had done no more than what others had done before him, when there were three Witneſſes beſides, and they had got the ſtart in the Diſcovery, his diſcovery had been in vain; and therefore he was concerned perhaps to ſtrain, that he might make ſuch a Diſcovery as might anſwer his end; and this will ariſe naturally, I ſuppoſe, out of what has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in this Caſe: For it ſeems, though it was ſomething long before he got his Pardon, now he has it. My Lord, another thing is this, How far my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> will be credited in this Matter, we ſhall leave his Credit to you Gentlemen, upon what we ſhall prove. For we ſhall make it out by perſons of great Honor, and perſons of great Integrity, That upon Diſcourſe concerning this Conſpiracy, my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> did declare, That he knew of no Perſons that were Guilty of having any hand in it; he declared it upon his Honor, he declared it upon his Religion, and he uſed all the Aſſeverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were poſſible for a Man to offer, to make himſelf believed.</p>
               <p>My Lord, It may be Objected, as it has been ſome times, that that was to out-face the Conſpiracy, and ſo ſtop the Proſecution of that he knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo Guilty of: But however, thus far we may make uſe of it for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, That if my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> would, in the Face of Heaven, pawn his Honor, his Truſt, his Conſcience, and his Religion, to aſſert that which was not true, and under all thoſe Vows and Ingagements, affirm an Untruth; a Man that would deal ſo, and ſpeak an Untruth with that Solemnity, I think is not a Perſon of the ſame Credit, as a Perſon of certain known Truth and Veracity. For if a Man will ſay one thing one time, and that with ſolemn Vows and Aſſeverations, and Swear another thing the quite contrary another time, he does not ſtand ſo fair for Credit, I think, as he that alwayes maintains, and avows the Truth. So far we may make uſe of it very ſafely, I think, as to my Lord's Credit.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Another matter that we have to urge, is, That ſince the Tryal of my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and ſince the Tryal of Collonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> has in diſcourſe owned, that my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> died Innocent. If that be true, it will have a great weight ſure with you Gentlemen, to diſcredit my Lords Teſtimony: For then he hath Contradicted what he hath Sworn. For if my Lord Swore, that my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was Guilty, as all the World knows he did; and afterwards Soberly, and Publickly, ſhall have ſaid he died Innocent, he has contradicted his own Evidence, and his own Oath; and ſure is not to be believed as to what he Swears now againſt the Defendant. My Lord, It did not reſt there; but ſince the Tryal of Collonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> it will be proved by Witneſſes, that my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> did declare, That Collonel <hi>Sidney</hi> had hard Meaſure. This will be proved by Witneſſes; and 'tis rather to be preſumed, He meant hard Meaſure as to his own Teſtimony, which he was beſt knowing of, than of any thing elſe as to his Tryal. Now, how this Perſon of Great Honour can Solve this, and how it can ſtand with his Oath, and his Honour; I will leave it to you Gentlemen to judg of it. My Lord, I have another matter to ſay, That with me ſeems to have very great weight: My Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> upon ſome occaſions has ſaid, being in diſcourſe with a very great Intimate of his, and the man being ſpeaking of the World to come, ſpeaking of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58199:12"/>
Eternity, ſpeaking of the Immortality of the Soul, ſpeaking of the Rewards and Puniſhments of another Life; my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> ſhould ſay to him, <hi>How long wilt thou perſist in this Folly? How long wilt thou be ſo Fooliſhly prevailed upon, as to believe the World was ever Made, or will ever have an End?</hi> My Lord, If a Perſon be of that Opinion, and a Mans Judgment in ſuch things will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf in his Words; How far the Teſtimony of a man of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion ſhall influence a Jury when he ſtands ſingle, when there is no Fact to Juſtify him, in point of probable Circumſtance, will be eaſily obſervable, and I muſt leave it to the Gentlemen of the Jury to conſider.</p>
               <p>My Lord, We have another ſaying of my Lord <hi>Howards,</hi> which we ſhall give you an account of in the Proofs, and that was in Relation to his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Being free in diſcourſe, as my Lord is a Man very liberal that way; and his Friend inquiring whether he had his pardon: <hi>No,</hi> ſayes he; <hi>Nor I cannot have it, till the drudgery of Swearing be over.</hi> Truly 'tis a very odd thing, That a Man ſhould call that Drudgery that is his Duty. To teſtify the Truth, is as much the Duty of every honeſt Man, as any thing elſe. Men have died for the Truth, and we Look upon thoſe as Martyrs, and the beſt of Martyrs that dye for the Truth. Now, that this Noble Lord, or that any man ſhould call this a Drudgery, which is ſo manifeſt a Duty, by giving a true Teſtimony to preſerve the <hi>King's</hi> Life, and ſupport the Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Contrivance, and Conſpiracies of Evil men, is but an odd Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation; and truly I think is rather to be taken in this ſenſe, as to my Lord, That he did ſtrain a little to make his Diſcovery the more profitable to him; and ſo did ſay more (ſo far I may ſafely go) then any one elſe did ſay. And my Lord, This is that that I would obſerve upon the firſt part of the Evidence.</p>
               <p>As for that part that Concerns <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> the Evidence given by <hi>Sheriffe</hi> and <hi>Bell,</hi> I ſubmit that to your Lordſhip, how far that can any way affect Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> the Defendant. It is introduced to Fortify the Teſtimony of my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> and it is introduced by himſelf thus: That at their Meeting at Mr. <hi>Hambden's</hi> Houſe, there was a Diſcourſe of ſome Aſſiſtance to be had from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; but ſayes he, at the ſecond Meeting at my Lord <hi>Ruſſels,</hi> then it came to a further diſcourſe, and Collonel <hi>Sidney</hi> did undertake to name a Perſon to ſend thither; and a Perſon was named; he does not ſay Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> was concerned in it, or that Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> named the man, or any thing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular as to Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> more then that he was in the Company. Mr. <hi>Hamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> had no hand in the undertaking, or ſending him into <hi>Scotland</hi>; that was altogether the part of Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi>; ſave this, that he ſayes my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> Writ the Letter that was to go by him. It does not appear Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> was at all concerned in it, but only was there.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>What is meant by Conſent, when nothing was ſaid, I muſt leave to the Jury. I muſt agree, the L. <hi>Howard</hi> did Swear, that my Clyent was in their Company, but how far he did, or did not Conſent, does not at all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; and how far this will Charge my Clyent, I muſt leave to you Gentlemen. But the Proof, as to this matter, ſtands thus; that <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was at <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> in <hi>February</hi> laſt, that he went publickly. Now, my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> ſayes, that he went to agitate a Confederacy between the Malecontents of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>England.</hi> Now it is ſtrange, that a man that was to agitate ſuch a Concern, ſhould go publickly with a Servant to <hi>New-Caſtle</hi>; ſo publickly as to be known again; and of his own accord, tell them he was going to ſuch a place in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And be it ſo in Fact, Will any man apply this to any thing was done before (as my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> ſayes about a Conſultation to joyn in Rebellion?) Will any man think, that he ſhould talk at that kind of rate, if that were his Employment, and tell whether he were going? But I rely upon this, in point of Evidence. 'Tis not proved yet, that <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> That he came within Six miles of the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is proved; but it is not proved he was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or did Agitate any Conſpiracy there; or did any thing more, than go within Six miles of the Borders of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But then they would preſs it further, and they ſay, that there were ſome <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen, that in the Summer came here into <hi>England,</hi> and that they hid themſelves, when the Plot was Diſcovered. It does not appear my Clyent had any Converſation with theſe <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen, or any of them, or was ever in their Company. 'Tis a very remote inference to bring any thing of this to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect my Clyent in this High Charge.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Lord,</hi> We ſhall add one thing more to diſprove that part of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that layes the Imputation of Turbulency and Sedition to the Charge of Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>; and which alſo will ſhew the improbability of his being concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any thing of this Nature. We ſhall prove him to be a Perſon of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Converſation, of a retired Life, and ſtudious Diſpoſition; and as an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for the Defendant, we ſhall prove, that he, in <hi>October</hi> 1680. left <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> for his Healths ſake, and went into <hi>France</hi> for the recovery of his Health. He continued there till about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> was <hi>Twelve</hi> Month, then he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 'Tis true, he continued in <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> to the time they ſpeak of; but we ſhall make it plain, that in <hi>February,</hi> my Clyent, and my Lord <hi>Mountague</hi> had adjuſted matters between themſelves, to go the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Summer again into <hi>France,</hi> there to continue and abide ſome time for their Healths. Here is a ſtrange kind of imagination, that this Contrivance between my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> that was going on before this time, and that was Diſappointed, and my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> went away, and afterwards Dyed in <hi>Holland,</hi> was taken up by my Clyent, and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons when my Clyent, as we ſhall prove, never intended to ſtay in <hi>England.</hi> My <hi>Lord,</hi> he was a <hi>Parliament-man</hi> in both the laſt <hi>Parliaments,</hi> but appeared in neither of them, being all the while in <hi>France,</hi> for the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his Health. We ſhall prove him to be one Studiouſly inclined, that he lived a Retired Life, and kept very little or no Company; and you will hear from Perſons of very great Honour and Quality, what he is, as to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and as to his Opinion; and then we ſhall ſubmit it to you Gentlemen of the Jury, whether you can believe him Guilty of this he is Charged with, which is your Iſſue. You are to try, whether he be Guilty, or Not Guilty of the Crime Charged in the Indictment.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, As near as I can, I will repeat the ſame words again, I had little Acquaintance with my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>; But meeting him often at my Brothers Houſe, (and being he was extraordinary pleaſant Company, I muſt needs ſay that he was ſo, and a Man of great Wit) and I coming from <hi>White-Hall,</hi> he asked me what news of the Plot? I told him there were ſome People that were in the Proclamation, or would be, and I named their Names. Says he, I know none of them except <hi>Rombald,</hi> I think; and by chance I met him paſſing through the Old Exchange, and he ſaluted me very kindly. After this my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was taken, and when my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> heard that, ſays he, then we are all undone. And I very much fear it is a Sham Plot, ſince they have ſeized upon my Lord, and I doubt he is a loſt man. After that, I think as near as I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member—The next thing was this — If you look upon the Book, you will ſee what I ſaid there.</p>

               <p>We are not to look upon the Book, man. You muſt give your Evidence your ſelf Mr. <hi>Howard,</hi> I hope you do not Swear by Book? Let the truth come out in Gods Name, whatever it be.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

               </speaker>
               <p>Then my Lord Colonel, <hi>Sidney</hi> was taken, and ſays my Lord, I am extremely troubled for Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> for he is my very good Friend. ſaid I, why are you not concerned for my Lord <hi>Ruſſel?</hi> He is of your Blood, ſays he, he is a man without exceptions. There is no man of ſuch honor as he, but I am concerned for Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> as that particular man that has obliged me above all the World, but I never heard my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> name Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> in all my life.</p>

               <p>My Lord, This is Evidence for the Defendant. If the Kings Counſel will call you afterwards to make Anſwer to any of theſe things, then is your time to ſpeak. We will not let them interrupt you when you come to ſpeak, nor muſt you interrupt them now. We are bound to hear both ſides, and ſo by the grace of God we will do.</p>

               <p>Sometime after Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> was taken, my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> came to ſee me, and complaining of the Times, ſaid, That all things were very ſad and dangerous, and if ever he was queſtioned again, he would not Plead, but deſire them only to count Noſes, for the quickeſt diſpatch he thought was beſt: I replyed, ſure his Lordſhip was in jeſt. He ſaid, No, he was in earneſt, for he was confident if he came to Tryal, they would have his Life, let him appear never ſo innocent. I ſaid, I hoped not ſo, it was only his Lordſhips fear, and becauſe of that, I thought it might be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med he would venture much, rather then be Tryed. And diſcourſing of the late Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi>'s Prophecy; He ſaid, for his part, he thought the Perſecution was already begun, and he did believe it would be very ſharp, but withal, he hoped it would be but ſhort; and then he began to wiſh himſelf beyond Sea till the Troubles were over; and in complyance with his Lordſhip I did wiſh ſo too. But as to <hi>Sidney,</hi> he did with great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverations very much aſſert his innocency. He ſaid, he thought he was not guilty of any of the things laid to his Charge; and ſpake with large Encomiums in his praiſe, as he had obligation to do, and ſeemed to bemoan his misfortunes; which I ſaid I had then reaſon to believe he was real in, for I believe never any man was more engaged to another then he to Colonel <hi>Sidney.</hi> I told him there was a diſcourſe of ſome Writings of Mr. <hi>Sidneys</hi> that were taken; he ſaid he was confident they could make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any Writing of his; I told him, I ſuppoſed he meant legall they could not do it, This was the moſt he ſaid, as to Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned nothing that I know of.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Well, who do you call next?</p>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> Pray what have you heard my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> ſay concerning the Plot, and when?</p>

               <p>My Lord ſits there, and I believe he may remember it was about the 7th of <hi>July,</hi> the <hi>Saturday</hi> before my Lord went into the Country, to the beſt of my memory, which was, I take it, the 9th of <hi>July.</hi> Upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the 7th at Night my Lord came to ſee me, I told him I was glad to ſee him abroad, and not concerned in the Diſorders that were then ſo general; My Lord told me he had been wiſhed joy by ſeveral, and he took it ill, becauſe it looked as if he were guilty. 'Tis true, my Lord was a man of great fineſs and readineſs in diſcourſe, and came eaſily into all Company, my Lord ſaid that was true, but he had ſo carefully beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf, that he was ſure they could not touch him with any thing, nor did he know any thing of any body elſe that he could charge them withal.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray good my Lord, Why did you joy my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> had you any reaſon to miſtruſt my Lord?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. <hi>Paget.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>No other reaſon, then becauſe I knew he was a man of great freedom in diſcourſe, and might be concerned upon that account.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>And he would frequently diſcourſe againſt the Goverment I ſuppoſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. <hi>Paget.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>No, I never heard my Lord diſcourſe againſt the Government in my life.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Howard</hi> came to ſee me the day after the diſcourſe of the Plot broke out, <hi>Thurſday</hi> I think it was, on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> it began to be talked of. The thing was little underſtood then, but in general a Plot was diſcovered, and my Lord with a great many Proteſtations, lifting up his hands and eyes to Heaven, proteſted he knew of none, and believed there was none, and ſpake of the whole thing as a Contrivance.</p>
            </sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>This was the day after the Diſcovery broke out?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Yes, the day after that I firſt heard of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Had you any other diſcourſe with my Lord about it?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I had not ſeen my Lord before of ſome Months. And then he ſpake a great deal to me. He told me he had been in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and after that he went to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and went ſo early and came away before the Company came, becauſe he would avoid all danger. And he expreſſed great apprehenſions of fear of Sham-Plots, and ſpake of Falſe Witneſſes and former deſigns of that Nature. The truth of it was, one had poſſeſſed me much with a belief of the thing, it being then but a ſecret, but he ſtrove to diſpoſſeſs me of that belief, and his whole diſcourſe ran up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that for an whole hour, and expreſſed, as I ſaid, great fear of ſome Sham-Contrivance, and ſpake much of falſe Witneſſes, wiſhing that he were beyond Sea.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>What, he ſpake as if there were like to be great heats and ſtirs, I ſuppoſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>No, the talk was about the Diſcovery, which he ſaid he believed was a Contrivance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Did my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> uſe to come to you ſome times?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Yes, he uſed to come frequently to ſee me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> Pray let me ask you one Queſtion, you ſpake of ſolemn Declarations and Proteſtations made by my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> what gave the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſuch a Solemnity?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I will tell you the occaſion truly, tho it was never asked me before. It was thus, I being poſſeſſed with the belief of the thing by one that aſſured me it was true, and would ſoon appear to be ſo, I argued upon that belief to convince my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> that it was true, and he argued a great deal to diſpoſſeſs me of that belief. And I ſaid, if there be any ſuch thing I pray God forgive them that are concerned, but certainly it is one of the monſtrouſeſt ill things that ever was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58199:16"/>
done; for hereby they have done all that could be done to ruine the Proteſtant Religion. He was ſmoaking a Pipe of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and he laid down his Pipe, and lifted up his hands and eyes to Heaven, and proteſted to me, he neither knew of any ſuch thing, nor believed it, but it was all a Contrivance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>By his diſcourſe, you poſſibly might underſtand what he meant, did he mean being privy to the Murder of the King or the raiſing of Rebellion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>There was not a word then of the Aſſaſſination, but it was all of the Plot in general.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Did he make no diſtinction?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>We talked of nothing but Plot in general. For the particulars were not then known. It was only about the general notion of a Plot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray what was the reaſon you had to believe it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>There was a Gentleman from <hi>Whitehall</hi> that came to ſee me, and he did aſſure me it was true, as being one that had it from a Privy-Councellor. This was on the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> when the Council ſate long about it; and nothing of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars was then let out, but only a diſcourſe in general of ſuch a thing, and he ſaid it would be found to be a certain truth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>But Doctor did not you a little wonder at the carriage of my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>? That a man that was not accuſed, that you heard of, ſhould make ſuch ſolemn Proteſtations?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, he ſaid juſt in this manner as I have told you, when I ſaid, <hi>Pray God forgive them if any have been concerned in ſuch a thing,</hi> he laid down his Pipe, and lift up his hands and eyes. Whether he thought I ſuſpected him or no, I can't tell, he beſt knows his own thoughts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Did he ſay a word of Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>No, there was not any particular perſon named.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Recorder.</speaker>

               </speaker>
               <p>His whole hours diſcourſe was to diſpoſſeſs me of the opinion and belief I had entertained of the Plot.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Yes, I did ſo, and he laboured to diſpoſſeſs me of that belief.</p>

The next day I went and waited upon my Lord at his Lodging at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and after the Complements paſſed, my Lord began a diſcourſe of the Plot, and I told him, That I heard none of the Witneſſes had their Pardons, but only <hi>Keiling</hi> the firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer. My Lord told me no, but he had a Warrant for his Pardon, and with that he plucked it out and ſhewed it me, and I read it. And then I told him I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58199:16"/>
thought it was of no avail without he had his Pardon actually under Seal. He ſaid no, but he had their word and honour; But, ſaid he, when I firſt received the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, they ſaid I ſhould not meddle in it till I heard from them again; which I have not yet, and I aſcribe it to no other reaſon but only this, That I muſt not have it till the drudgery of ſwearing it over.</p>

               <p>If your Lordſhip pleaſe, We will prove in what condition my Lord <hi>Angleſey</hi> is, and then we hope your Lordſhip will give us leave to prove what my Lord has ſaid concerning my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s diſcourſes with him.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, you lay it before us, but you are a Lawyer, do you your ſelf think fit it ſhould be done?</p>

               <p>Come, will you conſent, that what the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> has ſaid, ſhall be given in Evidence, and then I preſume the King's Council will conſent to your requeſt.</p>

               <p>But if ſo be there be leave given on one ſide to tell what another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has ſaid, why ſhould not it be conſented to on the other ſide, that it be proved what a 3d perſon that is abſent has ſaid for them?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>But you know the Law, why ſhould you offer any ſuch thing? your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it will make the <hi>Lay gens</hi> that know not the Law, think that the Court put hardſhips upon people, in denying things which you that underſtand the Law know can't be granted.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Why do you ſpend our time in urging things that are nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and cannot be allowed?</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Now my Lord, We will go on to another part of our defence, and that is, to call Witneſſes to the Reputation of Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> and his behaviour, to ſatisfie you, that he cannot be ſuch a perſon as the Indictment ſays, and as he muſt be if it be true what this Gentleman my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> has ſworn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Thompſon.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>We will firſt examine my Lord <hi>Paget.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, We ask you to that queſtion. Have you known this Gentleman Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> and what a ſort of a man is he?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord <hi>Paget.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I have good reaſon to know him. I have known him a great while, and have always believed him an Honeſt and a Prudent man, a man of Honor and Vertue and Integrity, my Lord; and I have had no reaſon to have other Opinion of him. I know he has been always ever ſince he came abroad into the World a man that hath loved his Study, and Books and a contemplative life. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhould not be apt to believe, That he could apply himſelf to a thing ſo contrary to his own nature, and to that way that he delighted in, and had always
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58199:17"/>
hitherto applied himſelf unto, I mean to ingage in a deſign of ſo much Malice and Wickedneſs.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, You have had a long Converſation with the knowledge of Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> you ſay. What ſay you as to his Diſpoſition; Becauſe this Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſays he is a Perſon of a Turbulent, Factious, Seditious Spirit?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord <hi>Paget.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I have always known him a quiet peaceable man, not medling in Buſineſs, very Friendly, free from all Turbulency, not of much acquaintance nor deſirous to make much.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Pray my Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> upon the ſame Oath you have taken, have you not at any time heard him expreſs diſſatisfaction as to the Male-adminiſtration of the Government?</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> was then in <hi>France,</hi> and not in that Parliament, tho he was a Member. Where is Mr. <hi>Pelham</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Here he is. He ſits down here <stage>pointing to the Table</stage> What would you ask him?<stage>He was Sworn</stage>

               </speaker>
               <p>Sir, Will you pleaſe to acquaint the Court, what acquaintance you have had with Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> and how long? And what you know of him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>You hear the Queſtion, Sir, how long have you been acquainted with Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Pelham.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I have been acquainted with Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> about five or ſix Years living near him, and all that I could obſerve from him was, that he was a man much addicted to his Studies, kept much at home, and I never obſerved that he had much acquaintance, but as to the buſineſs before you, I know nothing of it, nor ever heard him ſpeak any thing relating to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
               <p>As to his Spirit and Diſpoſition, is he a Turbulent Man?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Pelham.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>No, I never found him any thing like it. We never talked together of matters of that nature.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Were you ever in his Company at any time when he diſcourſed about Government?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Pelham.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>No, I was never with him at any time when he diſcourſed of any ſuch thing.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, We oppoſe his being a Witneſs. He is one of his Bail.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>That was upon the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act, not upon this Indictment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>If he be Bail for the Defendant, my Lord, he cannot be a Witneſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I appeal to the Rule of Court, whether he was not Bail upon the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act only?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Appeal where you will, the Bail cannot be a Witneſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>We moved for an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> the beginning of laſt Term upon the late Act for <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>'s. And then at the laſt day of the Term upon <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> he was brought up thither, and was Bailed upon that Writ.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Are not you one of the Bail, Sir <hi>Henry Hobart</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Henry Hobart.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I was one of his Bail, I think it was for his appearance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>If he be one of his Bail that he ſhall appear in this Court the firſt day of this Term, and ſo from day to day till he ſhall be diſcharged, and remains under that Recognizance, then in any Caſe againſt him, he cannot be a Witneſs for him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>But they miſtake the matter, He was then charged with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, He then Pleaded to it, and was Bailed to anſwer the Indictment; and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that caſe he can never be a Witneſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>That is certainly very true, and you know the Law ſo well Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> that I wonder you will inſiſt of it; in every ordinary Caſe it is every days practice to deny the Bail to be Witneſſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Here is the perſon principal, will they render him in Cuſtody?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, what ſay you, will you render him in cuſtody? Then we will diſcharge the Bail.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I will tell you what we will do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Tell me what you will do! anſwer my queſtion, will you render him in Cuſtody?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>We will change the Bail, My Lord, and find ſome other

ſufficient Perſon to ſtand in Sr. <hi>Henry Hobart</hi>'s place, rather then loſe our Witneſs.</p>

And it was not only what he told me, but I had a Letter from a Friend of mine in <hi>France</hi> to whom I had ſent to deſire him to come over; but he writ me word, no, Mr <hi>Hambden</hi> was coming over again, and he would not come back yet.</p>

He always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in his Diſcourſe a great ſubmiſſion, and reſpect that he had for the Laws of his Nation and his Prince, and to that degree he was a faithful Subject to the King, that once he told him in diſcourſing with him of the late Popiſh Plot, that he was ready to Sacrifice his Life and Fortune for the King's ſervice.</p>

My Lord <hi>Howard</hi> has proved that my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and Five more, of which Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> was one, met and conſulted about ſuch matters. We may I hope be admitted to prove, That my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was not there; for if we can take off his poſitive proof, as to any one of the Circumſtances, we take off from the Truth of the Fact. If all the Perſons were not there; then my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in that, and accordingly muſt not be believed in the reſt; Therefore my Lord, I preſs it no otherwiſe: He hath proved theſe Six Perſons were there I offer this as ſome Evidence, That it is unlikely it ſhould be ſo, becauſe my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had ſo little Opinion of my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> that he would never conſult with him about any matter.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, the Evidence has been ſomething long, and the Counſel both for the King, and for Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> againſt whom this Indictment has already been found by the Grand Jury, having left it to the Court to Sum up all, I ſhall do it as well as I can: And the Queſtion before you Gentlemen is, VVhether the Defendant be guilty of the Offence charged in the Indictment, or not Guilty, and there having been ſo long an Evidence on the one ſide, and on the other, it will be fit for me according to the beſt of my remembrance to help your Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by recollecting what has been ſaid on both ſides which I ſhall do as near as I can, and if my Brethren will pleaſe to ſupply any thing that ſhall be omitted by me, nay, if the Counſel for the King, or for the Priſoner will put us in mind of any thing that has been ſpoken, and proved either againſt, or for the Party indicted,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58199:20"/>
in God's Name let them have liberty to ſpeak it: For it is fit the Queſtion ſhould be left before you with all fairneſs, and according to the beſt of my Obſervation and Memory thus it ſtands.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing Gentlemen that is conſiderable to you, is, that there is ſuch an Indictment as has been already opened unto you, that is preferred againſt Mr. <hi>Hamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> that does ſet forth, that Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> is a Seditious-Perſon, and a Man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Language of the Indictment (which are words of courſe and form in an Indictment of this Nature) of an evil diſpoſition, deſigning to diſturb and diſtract the Government, and that he with ſeveral other Perſons did conſpire to Bring in troubles, and perplexities upon the Government; and in order to that, that there were ſome meetings between him and ſeveral other Perſons and that there was a deſign to conciliate ſome Perſons of another Nation to go along with them in their deſign, particularly ſome in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> This is the purport in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which the Defendant has pleaded not Guilty.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The Evidence for the King has been of this ſort, they did at the beginning, which yet I muſt tell you by the way, is not any thing of Evidence, but the Kings Counſel would make ſome Overtures to preſs on their ſide, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, and thoſe that are of Counſel for Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> have made ſome little hints to preſs on their ſide, that ſome Witneſſes the one and the others would have had here, were <hi>ſubpoena'd</hi> but could not be here. It ſeems by the proof, Here was a meeting, as it was between Six ſeveral Perſons, and they Name them, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was one, the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> another, the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> a Third, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> a Fourth, <hi>Algernoon Sidney</hi> a Fifth, and Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> the Sixth. As for my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> he is gone to his long home, my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> have received Sentence, and been executed. So there remains Three Survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving, and ſay they that are for the King: We produce my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> and we have taken care to Summon the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> by leaving <hi>Subpoenas</hi> where it could be thought he was to be met with, with Promiſes of his Servants to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them to him in order to have the Duke to be a Witneſs for the King this Day. I preſume the meaning is, They would infer from that, that they would give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the fairneſs of this proceeding, tho it has been a matter that has obtained a ſort of belief in the World, as tho the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> had denied, that there was any ſuch thing as this Confederacy and Conſpiracy: And that has given People occaſion to be of very different Opinions, and perſuaſions about the matter; but ſay they, to ſhew we are not afraid to have the Truth come out, we have done as much as in us lay to get this Perſon hither: Therefore we have left <hi>Subpoena's</hi> at his Houſes, at his Lodging with his Servants, and they have promiſed to take care they ſhould be delivered to him, and he is not come. Againſt this on the other ſide, ſay they, for the Defendant, VVe have taken all the care we could to bring my Lord <hi>Angleſey,</hi> who was to have been a VVitneſs for the advantage of the Perſon indicted, but my Lord <hi>Angleſey</hi> is at preſent afflicted with a fit of the Gout, and for that very reaſon we can't have him here. And ſo they ſhew, that they have been very zealous to get VVitneſſes on their ſide to vindicate their Reputation, but they did not meet with that effect that they deſired. Theſe two things Gentlemen are matters that are uſed both againſt him one way, and for him another.</p>
               <p>But now to come home to the Evidence upon which this matter is to turn, and here you are to conſider, that whatſoever has been ſaid or offered by the Kings Counſel on the one ſide, or the Counſel for the Defendant on the other ſide, (I call him ſo, for 'tis but a Treſpaſs tho a great one) You muſt not take into your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration at all any further then as their Allegations are ſupported by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that has been given: And whatſoever the VVitneſſes have ſaid either for or againſt him, and our of that Teſtimony as near as I can remember I will give you the Objections, and their Anſwers with the Obſervations, that have been made, or do naturally ariſe out of the facts in proof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:58199:21"/>My Lord <hi>How.</hi> In the firſt place gives an account of this matter, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the times will be wonderful material, and therefore I begg you would take a Pen, and Ink, and mark theſe material circumſtances as you go. For in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact poſitively proved, which alſo have their Credit ſupported by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which do accompany them, the Teſtimonies given of ſuch Facts are to be valued according as thoſe circumſtances keep touch with, and humor as I may ſo ſay, the Fact that they are to Evidence the truth of.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>How.</hi> does therefore in the firſt place acquaint you, that about <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas</hi> there was a diſcourſe between him and my Lord of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and that was concerning a riſing intended to be had, and he tells you how that my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> was fully reſolved upon it; That things at length came to that paſs; That he was forced to go from his own houſe, as he ſaid, being diſappointed by the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and others who had promiſed to joyn with him, and was retired to the houſe of one <hi>Watſon</hi> in or near <hi>Woodſtreet.</hi> But he underſtanding where he was, my Lord <hi>How.</hi> went to him, (I think he ſays my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> ſent to him) when he came, my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> told him, That altho there had been ſuch a diſappointment by thoſe Perſons he named, yet that did not take off his edge, but he was reſolved to go on himſelf, nay tho his body was infirm, yet he would be ſet on horſe-back, tho he was lifted up to appear in the head of a party that he had prepared, and were ready when he would call them. And he began then to reflect upon the diſappointment of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and as tho the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> had only a proſpect to advance himſelf, and had only an Eye upon his own particular Intereſt. That he ſo managed matters as if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to have the ſole diſpoſition of all things whatſoever, and began to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> My Lord <hi>How.</hi> did endeavour to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with my Lord of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> for a reconciliation between the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> and him, it being a matter that required ſo much ſafety and ſecurity, and did deſire him that he would have ſome intercourſe with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> in order to conciliate a friendſhip between them, that they might go hand in hand. You find he was under ſome difficulties about this matter, he was not able to bring the thing about; for after he had ſpake with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him, my Lord of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> was peeviſh, and talked at a diſtance, and when he had appointed a meeting one time, it was prevented, my Lord <hi>Shaftes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> went away into <hi>Holland,</hi> and there died in <hi>Holland.</hi> This is the ſubſtance of what my Lord <hi>How.</hi> ſays as to that matter.</p>
               <p>But Gentlemen this is material, and Ile tell you why I think it material; becauſe the Counſel for the Defendant have made it an Objection particularly to my Lord <hi>Howards</hi> teſtimony, That my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> is particular as to the day after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day, but he is not ſo particular when he comes to ſpeak of other times upon which the true Queſtion before you depends. For now he ſpeaks more generally as to the meetings at the Defendants, and my Lord <hi>Ruſſells,</hi> that they were about the middle of <hi>Janu.</hi> and the beginning of <hi>Febru.</hi> and is not particular as to the day. I ſpeak of this becauſe that has been made uſe of as an Objection againſt my Lord <hi>Howards</hi> teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And I will tell you as near as I can all the Objections that have been made againſt this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony after ſuch time as I have ſettled it and laid before you what the whole of it amounts to.</p>
               <p>Then comes my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> and ſays, that meeting with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſome time after this they began to talk together, and they thought that tho the buſineſs had failed in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagery of my Lord of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> yet it was fit there ſhould be a reaſſuming of the buſineſs again, but in order to ſettle matters that things might not go inconſiderately on, it was thought fit that they ſhould reſolve themſelves into a certain number that were confident one of another, in order to Steer and Tranſact theſe matters the better among themſelves. And they muſt be perſons fit to be truſted and for whom there ſhould be an undertaking among them for their Faithfulneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity; for all Perſons are not fit to be truſted, but only ſuch as they agreed upon. The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> he undertook for my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and my Lord <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> thoſe were the Perſons for whom he would ingage, as likewiſe for my Lord <hi>Salisbury.</hi> And then they began to talk of ſome more, particularly of Mr. <hi>Sidney,</hi> but he was a Cynical man, and a Philoſopher, and they were firſt to come to him, and to treat with him in another manner then the reſt. He was not to appear as the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> but to take him in his retirement and privacys, and then they might be the better able to break the matter to him. And he ſays accordingly there was a time
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58199:21"/>
deſigned on purpoſe; and at that ſame time the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> did go and attack Mr. <hi>Sidney,</hi> they found him on a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate day, and Dined with him; and upon that Dinner the whole matter was broke up, and put into ſome Method; Then was the whole Deſign contrived as to the Perſons that were to be ingaged in this Matter; and he ſays, They agreed upon Six. The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> undertook for my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> undertook for Mr. <hi>Hamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> He ſpeaks of my Lord of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> but my Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi> was never there among them, and ſo I put him out of the Caſe, I quit him from being of their Number, becauſe there was but Six in all, my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> who were undertaken for by the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> undertaken for by Mr. <hi>Sidney,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>; for by that time Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> was come into the Matter upon Col. <hi>Sidney</hi>'s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
               <p>Now we are got, Gent. by theſe ſteps till we come about the middle of <hi>January</hi>; but ſays my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> I cannot poſitively ſay, it was this day, or that day of the Month; but being about the middle of <hi>January,</hi> I conjecture it was about the 14<hi>th,</hi> but he is not poſitive to the day. He ſays, accordingly they went to Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s Houſe, which was the place firſt deſign'd for them to meet in. He ſays, there accordingly they did all Six meet; and that it being Mr. <hi>Hambdens</hi> Houſe, they thought it moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for him who was Maſter of the Houſe, who uſually bids his Gueſts welcome, to break ſilence, and to impart the buſineſs of the Deſign they met about. He ſays, accordingly Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> after the firſt Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Entertainment, did give an account of the buſineſs they were come about, and that it was in order to have a Riſing. This he ſays was propoſed by Mr. <hi>Hambden.</hi> He tells you, then they fell into Debate about the time when, concerning Men, and Arms, and Money; and likewiſe concerning the Places. He tells you, the Places wherein the Riſing was deſign'd to be, were <hi>Devonſhire, Cheſhire, Somerſetſhire,</hi> and other places, that is, as to the Circumſtance of the Place. Then he tells you concerning the time; it was Debated, Whether it ſhould be all at one time, or at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times? Whether they ſhould onely begin here, and the Country fall in, or all at once? That likewiſe they had in conſideration the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Money, and that his Grace the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did ſpeak of 30 or 35 Thouſand Pounds, or ſome ſuch Sum at that time. But then, as was natural for men of Deliberation and Conſideration to conſult about, they took into Debate, that they might not go headlong, to endeavour to conciliate another Party to chime in, as he ſays, along with them, in the buſineſs they were going about, and accordingly it was thought fit, and propoſed, That there ſhould be an endeavour to conciliate a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with ſome Perſons in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to fall in with them; and then he tells you, who the Perſons were, that were named: Some of the Names he remembers, and others he has forgot; he ſpeaks particularly of the <hi>Cambeles,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cockram,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Melvin</hi>: and he ſays, other perſons were mentioned, but he can't remember their Names: and my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> knew ſome of theſe perſons, and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> knew ſome others of them, becauſe of his near Relation to the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> the perſon that you know was proſcrib'd for Treaſon in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> He ſays, that ſo far the debate of this Matter went, that they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58199:22"/>
thought fit a Meſſenger ſhould be provided, a Truſty man to be ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>
                  <hi>Scotland</hi> to Treat with theſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> about this Matter; and my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> I think he ſays, undertook to write a Letter to be carryed by this Meſſenger to theſe <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>He ſays, purſuant to this Conſultation at Mr. <hi>Hambdens,</hi> a Fortnight after, or thereabouts, which brings it up to the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> then was the Meeting at my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Houſe, and there they Deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe Matters over again, and the whole managery of ſending a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into <hi>Scotland,</hi> was left to the diſcretion of Col. <hi>Sidney,</hi> and he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took that Work, that was his Poſt that he was to manage: and he does ſay, That he does very well remember, That <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was the perſon propoſed then; and tho' he was unknown to ſome of the Company, yet he was well known to others; and by reaſon of that knowledge that others had of him, they looked upon him as a perſon very fit, and every way qualify'd for it.</p>
               <p>So that Gentlemen, here is proved a Conſultation in order to the Raiſing of Men to Infeſt the Government; a diſcourſe concerning Money and Arms for this End, and the Places where, and the time when; and of conciliating a Friendſhip with ſome diſcontented perſons in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to joyn, and chime in with theſe Conſpirators in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then there is yet another Circumſtance very Remarkable, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe tho my Lord ſpake it not at the ſame time that he delivered his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, yet upon the Queſtion asked, he gives you a plain account of it; and it has a plain dependance upon what went before. Said they among themſelves, 'Tis proper for us, as near as we can, to ſhut the Door againſt any Exceptions about theſe Mens coming to Treat with us; but how ſhall we get them hither without Suſpition? We muſt have ſome Shams, or Cant or other, to be a pretence for theſe People to come into <hi>England</hi>; and that was agreed to be about ſome Plantation in <hi>Carolina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, he ſays, was the Reſult of that Meeting; and that when the Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was broke up, about Three or Four Days afterwards, (mind the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of Time, <hi>Gent.</hi> for 'tis very material) Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> and he met together, they went to Col. <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Houſe, and there he ſaw him take Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out of a Till, where there were ſeveral hundreds of Guineys, or pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gold; and as he believes, he ſays, he took Threeſcore Guineys, or ſome ſuch Sum; and told him, it was to give to <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> in order to his Journey into <hi>Scotland:</hi> That he went out with him in his Coach, but Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> ſet him down by the way, and he himſelf went into <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> telling him, he went to that purpoſe, to give <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> the Money. Some time after, about a Week, or a Fortnight, or Ten Days after that, he ſays, he met with Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> again; and he ſays, Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> gave him an account, That he had heard <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> had been at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> but he had not heard of him ſince that time, and that is another Circumſtance in point of Time, <hi>Gent.</hi> So that you have here a poſitive Oath made by my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> was privy, and conſenting to all theſe Debates, as to the Raiſing of Men, and the Levying of Money, and about
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58199:22"/>
the conciliating a Friendſhip with theſe men of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and about ſending a Meſſenger into <hi>Scotland</hi> to that purpoſe. And if my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> do Swear true, no man living can doubt but that Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> is guilty of this Indictment. The firſt meeting was at his Houſe, and there he did take notice of what had been formerly done, and propoſed the things, breaking the ſilence, and entering into the Debate; which ſhews that he had been diſcourſing about it before, and had it in his thoughts before, or elſe he could not have propounded it as the end of their meeting.</p>
               <p>Now this, Gentlemen, Here is a poſitive Fact; and as Mr. <hi>VVilliams</hi> ſays true, no man living can give any Anſwer to a poſitive Fact, but by ſome other things that may be Circumſtances to oppoſe that Fact. Now he ſays, there are no Circumſtances that have been proved, that will give any Credibility to what has been depoſed, beſides the poſitive Oath of my Lord <hi>Howard.</hi> So that, ſays He, your Fact, tho it be poſitively Sworn, is not ſupported by any Circumſtances of the Fact, that may give Credibility to it. And he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects very materially; for if it be not ſupported by credible Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, then indeed it would be leſs material; yet I cannot ſay, it would not be at all material; it is material, and you are to determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have ſufficient Evidence given you, to induce you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> is at this time Guilty of wilful and malicious Perjury; for it is Perjury, and that in the higheſt degree, if it be not true that he ſays; and God deliver all Mankind from being Guilty of any ſuch thing. I leave that to your Conſciences, Gentlemen, who are the Judges of it.</p>
               <p>But ſays the Kings Councel, Here are Circumſtances that do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our Fact, and the Credibility of it. For firſt, here is the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> who was ſent into <hi>Scotland</hi> by Mr. <hi>Sydney</hi> in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of this deſign, and this Circumſtance my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> does ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn to what he has poſitively affirmed againſt the Defendant. And this Circumſtance is a thing that may be helped by other proof; and what is this Circumſtance? Say they, That <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was ſent into <hi>Scotland</hi>; and in order to prove that, they have called one <hi>Sheriff,</hi> who is a man that keeps an Inn at the Poſthouſe in <hi>New-Castle,</hi> from whence Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> told my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> he had notice of his arrival at <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> but had heard no more of him after that. And this <hi>Sheriff</hi> Swears directly, I ſaw that man they call <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> when he was ſhewn to me before the King and the Council; and Mr. <hi>Atterbury</hi> Swears he ſhew'd <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> to him, and then <hi>Sheriff</hi> ſwears that man you ſhew'd to me, was the Man I ſaw at my Houſe at <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> that chimes in with the Circumſtance of Fact that Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> heard from him at <hi>New-Castle.</hi> And then there is the Circumſtance of time when he ſaw him there; Says he, I ſaw him the <hi>Friday</hi> before <hi>Shrove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tueſday,</hi> which they in the <hi>North</hi> call <hi>Faſters-Even.</hi> He came to my Houſe on <hi>Thurſday</hi> night, and went away the next day, <hi>Friday</hi>; and he went with his Guide, the other man, <hi>Northward,</hi> in order to his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into <hi>Scotland,</hi> as he himſelf ſaid. Says he, I remember the time
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58199:23"/>
very particularly, it was the <hi>Friday</hi> before <hi>Shrovetueſday</hi> laſt, this <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> was Twelve-month; and he went yet further; ſays he, I did not only ſee him when he went away, but when he came back again, for he left his man at my Houſe all the time, and he tells you what his name was; for he ſays, <hi>Smith</hi> went under the diſguiſed name of one <hi>Clarke,</hi> and he did then talk of going to the <hi>VVeſtern</hi> parts of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he named <hi>Douglas</hi> as he thinks, tho he is not poſitive in that, but he is in the Perſon, that was the man. And ſays he, I ſent for this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the other fellow <hi>Bell,</hi> and he was the guide he had along with him. And upon <hi>Bells</hi> Examination, What ſays he? Says he, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that man came thither at that time to the other mans Houſe; I take it upon my Oath that is the man, and he went by the name of <hi>Clarke,</hi> he hired me to be his Guide; I went out with him on <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> morning, and I went a long with him all that day; but upon <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> which was the next day, going <hi>Northward</hi> with him, my Horſe tired, and failed me. Thereupon I was forced to be left behind, but I overtook him on <hi>Sunday</hi> night following; I overtook him at ſuch a place, and ſaw him within ſix Miles of the Borders of <hi>Scotland.</hi> I take it upon my Oath, this is the man that was there under the name of <hi>Clarke</hi>; and at his returning back again, I took notice of him, I went up to him, I drank with him, and we had diſcourſe of our Journey. He told me at firſt, he was to go to the <hi>VVeſt</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo he went <hi>Northward.</hi> After that, which was about Ten or Twelve days, he came back again, and ſo went <hi>Southward</hi> towards <hi>London.</hi> This he doth Swear directly to be at that time.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, The time is wonderful material in that Caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that very time Twelve-month that they talk of, is the beginning of <hi>February.</hi> If you look upon your old Almanack of the laſt year, (I happen to have one in my Pocket, and look upon it, when the men gave their Teſtimony) and there you will find that the <hi>Monday</hi> before <hi>Shrove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tueſday,</hi> when he ſays, he left him within ſix Miles of the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> falls out to be the 19<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February</hi>; I will look upon it again, leſt I ſhould miſtake; 'tis juſt ſo, and that humors the time that my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> ſpeaks of, which was about the middle of <hi>February,</hi> a few days after, that he ſays the Money was given by Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi>; and then for the time for <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> to get to <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> there is a fit ſpace of time, for it falls out that the <hi>Thurſday</hi> that he arrived at <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> is the fifteenth day of <hi>February,</hi> and ſo it falls in well with my Lord <hi>Howards</hi> Teſtimony, and ſo the <hi>Monday</hi> that he parted with him at the Borders of <hi>Scotland</hi> was the 19<hi>th,</hi> which alſo juſt humours the time that he ſpeaks of. So that here is a Circumſtance of Fact to confirm his Teſtimony, both as to the ſending the Meſſenger, and the Circumſtance of time. That he is the ſame man, is proved by theſe two Witneſſes, who agree in this, That he was there about ſuch a time; and it does likewiſe humour that other Circumſtance of place that Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> ſaid he had heard from him from <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> but not ſince; and then there is the other Circumſtance, which backs and confirms all, There was not only a ſending for theſe Perſons, but there is notice taken that theſe <hi>Cambeles,</hi> who were to be aſſiſting in this matter, were to come
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58199:23"/>
about the Sham, and under the diſguiſe of Purchaſing Plantations in <hi>Carolina.</hi> About the beginning of <hi>June</hi> they come to Town, the Two <hi>Cambels,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cockram,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Monrow.</hi> Sir <hi>Andrew Foſter</hi> he tells you, he met with ſome of the Men, and they told him, They came about the buſineſs of <hi>Carolina</hi>; and ſo the Cant of <hi>Carolina</hi> is made good in this circumſtance that way; but when the Plot brake out, theſe men ſculk, one flies one way, another another; ſome were taken as they were Eſcaping away by Water; others of them were taken upon the Bed at Noon-day in <hi>More-fields</hi>: Had the buſineſs they came over into <hi>England</hi> about, been a fair, and a lawful, and honeſt Buſineſs, why ſhould they hide themſelves? Why ſhould any Man ſneak and ſculk, and be aſhamed to own an honeſt and lawful buſineſs? But this does humor and touch the thing exactly, as to that circumſtance, That <hi>Carolina</hi> was onely a Cant for to diſguiſe their coming over. Theſe are the onely Two Circumſtances that ſeem to be pretty ſtrong for them, to prove, and ſupport the credibility of what their Witneſs has ſworn.</p>
               <p>For, Gentlemen, What a wonderful ſort of Expectation would it be, That we ſhall never Convict a man of High Treaſon, unleſs you can bring a man to be a Witneſs that is not concern'd? for then all theſe Perſons muſt have been acquitted, for they intruſted none, it ſeems, but theſe Six, they took care they would keep it amongſt themſelves. Do you think they called their Servants to be Witneſſes of what they were about? That is a vain and idle imagination? In the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> what Witneſſes of it had you there? Were they ſtrangers to the <hi>Plot</hi>? No, you cannot Expect any Witneſſes but ſuch as the nature of the Caſe will bear.</p>
               <p>This is the meaning of the Evidence that has been given for the King, and it carries a great weight in it. But they have made an Objection, which indeed is not remote, but may concern the Queſtion very much. Say they, If we prove my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was not there, or ſuch an one was not there, would it not discredit the Evidence of my Lord <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>? Yes, certainly, it would wholly diſcredit it, and he were not to be believed at all; nay, which is yet nearer to the Queſtion, If Mr. <hi>Hamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> that had notice all along of the times fixed wherein this Tranſaction was, to wit, about the middle of <hi>January,</hi> and beginning of <hi>February.</hi> For becauſe they talk of the Prints, Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> had from them ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Notice, and intimation of the Time. If Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> that hath had all this Notice, could have proved before you, That he was in <hi>France,</hi> or any other Place at that time, That had been wonderful Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial. But all the Circumſtances that are any way ſignificant to ſupport the Credit of this Matter, are very well proved; and ſo the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> is by theſe concurrent Circumſtances of Fact, ſufficiently ſupported.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Gent.</hi> I muſt tell you, This being the Subſtance of the Evidence for the King; I will now, as near as I can, give you an account of the Evidence for the Defendant; It was opened by Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly for the advantage of his <hi>Clyent;</hi> as every man is bound to ſay what he can for his <hi>Clyent.</hi> He made a great many Objections againſt my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>; for if he could but ſhake the Teſtimony of my Lord
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58199:24"/>
                  <hi>Howard,</hi> then he might eaſily bring off his <hi>Clyent</hi>; and if you, upon any thing that has been offered, either in Evidence, or by way of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation fairly made from the Evidence, do believe my Lord <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> has forſworn himſelf, you muſt find Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> the Defendant, Not Guilty; but if you believe he has not forſworn himſelf, you muſt find him Guilty. So all our matter is reduced into a very narrow compaſs; and therefore I muſt repeat it again what I ſaid at the beginning, If my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory do not ſerve me to recollect all right, the Councel for the Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſhall have free liberty to inform the Court of what has been omitted.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſays Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> My Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was a man very deep in a Conſpiracy with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> by his own Acknowledgment, endeavouring to conciliate a friendſhip between the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>; and ſo he had a great hand in the <hi>Plot</hi>; and what he might do on purpoſe to get himſelf out of danger from that <hi>Plot,</hi> and procure his Pardon, is not known.</p>
               <p>It is a very ſtrange thing, that it ſhould be an Objection before he had his Pardon, That he did it for fear, and to get his Pardon; and when he has it, now the Objection is, Becauſe he has his pardon; and he got it, ſay they, by this means. It ſeems, whether he had his Pardon or no, it muſt be an objection againſt him: before he had it, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fear of not obtaining it, till the drudgery of Swearing was over: but now he has his Pardon, What now? Why, he does it on purpoſe to accuſe other people. Why, he ſays no more now, than what he has ſaid before he was Pardoned; and if after he is Pardoned, when he is under no dread or fear becauſe of his Guilt, he ſays the ſame things that he did when he might be in fear, How can that be an Objection to him? It cannot be thought he does it to ſave his own Life, for that is as ſafe now by his Pardon, as it can any way be; and 'tis, and muſt be a great ſatisfaction to his mind, and will be ſo to any other reaſonable mans mind; and is a plain Anſwer to the Objection of his fear, (for 'tis a captious Age we live in, that will make ſome ſpecious Objection or other, though it be not of any great weight). But how can it be thought a man would come and Swear too much, or too far, for fear he ſhould not ſave himſelf: or as they call it, ſwear himſelf into a Pardon, when he has his Pardon? It might be an Objection before; but as long as he is under no ſuch Terrors now, but ſtands right, both by the Laws of God and Man to be heard as a Witneſs, I think it would be hard for any to come, and ſay, <hi>This man would for ſwear himſelf.</hi> What ſhould provoke him to come and forſwear himſelf, when he is under no danger as to his own particular? There might be an Umbrage, I ſay, of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection before he had his Pardon, though it was, indeed, no Objection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; not a rational weighty one, to ſet aſide his Teſtimony. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body knows which way in the World to ſatisfie the Minds of ſome ſort of people.</p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>Gent.</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> You are not poſitive as to the time; You ſay, It was about the middle of <hi>January,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> and that is too general and wide; but you remember parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to a Day the buſineſs between you and my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> That, that was the day after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day: how can you be ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular as to the one, and not as particular as to the other?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:58199:24"/>Why, I will undertake that Mr. <hi>VVilliams,</hi> when he made the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, muſt needs think of the Anſwer that would be given to it. It is notoriouſly known, that the Preſſures theſe Gentlemen thought they lay under, were what my Lord of <hi>Shaftbury</hi> ſaid, <hi>Now they have got the Juries into their own Power, and no man is ſafe; They will find me or any man Guilty, as they pleaſe</hi>; Why, how came they to get Juries into their own hands, but by having the Sheriffs as they would have them? Now the Sheriffs that are to return Juries, are, as all men know that know any thing, Sworn the day before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day; Therefore he might very well, and had good reaſon to remember that day; When ſuch a notorious thing happens to fall out at ſuch a notorious time, 'tis eaſier for a man to remember that time, than to ſpeak to the particular time of an Action done about the middle of a Month, where there is not ſuch a notorious Circumſtance. Why, I can tell you very well where I was upon the day before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day; Upon that day, and the day after; for that very reaſon, Becauſe it was a notorious day about the Swearing of Sheriffs in <hi>London.</hi> But if you ask me, Where I was the middle of <hi>January,</hi> or the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>February,</hi> I cannot ſo well remember that. But there is Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to be given to a man that ſpeaks to a notorious Circumſtance, and thereby proves the probability of what he ſays, tho he ſhould not be ſo particular in a thing that admits not of ſuch a notorious Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I make the Objections as they are ſtated on the one ſide, and on the other ſide; and the Anſwers that naturally flow to prove the matters before you one way or other; and you are to judge, you are to weigh them; and which has the greater Credit with you, you are to take notice of.</p>
               <p>He does ſay, in the next place, Here was a diſcourſe of Arms and Armed men, and a great ſum of Money ſpoken of, but there breaks out nothing of this matter till <hi>July</hi> following; but this debate was in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> and <hi>February</hi> before. For that matter, the Anſwer that is given, and it ſeems to be a plain one, is, That they were to conciliate a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with people that were abroad, and that they could not go on till they had effected that, and till theſe people came to joyn with them, which could not be without ſome time. And you hear the <hi>Cockrams</hi> and the <hi>Cambels</hi> came not to the Town, till <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi>; ſo that it was not probable it ſhould break out till then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was to be agitated upon their coming here. And ſo that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is anſwered, They did not apprehend any ſuch neceſſity for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent engaging in it. For, my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> becauſe he thought it would be a work of time to ſettle the Correſpondence, and get theſe people to Town, went down to his Country houſe in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>Bath,</hi> for he did apprehend ſome conſiderable time muſt be ſpent ere theſe pople could come; and therefore he thought it convenient to take his retirement in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Ay, but 'tis ſtrange, ſays Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and he makes that another
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58199:25"/>
Objection; He would have my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> to draw in this Accuſation of Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> to procure his pardon, by going further than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſcoverers had gone. It ſeems, ſay they, Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> was not thought of at firſt; But becauſe <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>Keeling</hi> had diſcovered a Plot, my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> to ſecure himſelf, muſt go a ſtep further than they, and (as the Defendants Councel would have it) than the Truth; and that is the ſtreſs of the Objection. But the weight of the proof is quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; for all men know, In the Plot there were ſeveral parts. There was the buſineſs of <hi>Keeling</hi> and <hi>VVeſt,</hi> and that was the Aſſaſſination of the King and the Duke; but the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> my Lord <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> and thoſe other Gentlemen, were for the buſineſs of the Riſing, tho that might be in order to that other purpoſe; but they kept not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with thoſe that were ingaged in that part of the deſign. They were the Underlings, the Scoundrel Plotters, that were concerned in the Aſſaſſination. But theſe Gentlemen looked upon themſelves to be the Privy Councellors, not to be the Executioners; they were to be only Adviſers, what was to be done after that other buſineſs was over; and their Conſultations were for raiſing of men for an Inſurrection; not the buſineſs of the Aſſaſſination of the King, that was not their Province. Can it then be an Objection againſt my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> becauſe he gives a Teſtimony <hi>VVeſt</hi> and <hi>Keeling</hi> could not give? Could they go further then the Killing of the King, which was their buſineſs? If any man ſhould have asked my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> about that matter, he would have made Anſwer, It was not for that purpoſe that we met together at Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi>'s, and my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s; no, that was upon a particular buſineſs, and to a particular end and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Then he ſays too, That tho my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> comes here upon his Oath, and declares theſe ſeveral matters that he hath depoſed; yet he has given a different accompt of things elſewhere, and he has called ſeveral Witneſſes to that purpoſe. To whom my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> ſeveral times upon his Honour, upon his Word, with Eyes lifted up, and Hands elevated to Heaven, and many extraordinary Proteſtations, declared, That he knew nothing of the Plot; and ſay they, If a man will at one time Pawn his Honour, and his Reputation, for the truth of a thing, and after that, will come again to Swear againſt all that matter, That is an Argument that does ſink the Credit and Reputation of that Witneſs; and thereupon they call you ſeveral Witneſſes, ſome whereof are Perſons of great Honour and Quality. I think they begin firſt with <hi>Ducas,</hi> Servant to Col. <hi>Sidney,</hi> and he tells you, After his Maſter was taken, my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> came thither, and deſired he might lye there; and deſired the uſe of ſome Plate and Goods of Col. <hi>Sidney</hi>'s; and then asked, what was become of his Maſter? And when <hi>Ducas</hi> told him what he heard of the Plot, that ſomething was talked of, about the Aſſaſſination of the King and the Duke, my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> lift up his Eyes, and his Hands to Heaven, and declared he knew nothing of it, but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> was a very honeſt man, and knew nothing at all of any ſuch matter; and as for himſelf, rather than he would be taken or confined again, he would do any thing. This was the Evidence they gave as to him. Then they come with Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> their 2<hi>d.</hi> Witneſs; for I would take
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58199:25"/>
them in order as they were produced, and he gives you an account, that he met with my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> told him he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of any Plot, and did believe that Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> was innocent, and he did believe likewiſe that my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was innocent, and for his part he knew nothing of any ſuch thing as a Plot, but he ſays when he began to talk to him, why did he make ſuch a Buſtle and go ſo often into the City and concern himſelf about the making of Sheriffs? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I do nothing but what is in a legal way, and he juſtified all that was done to be only in a legal way.</p>
               <p>When once people come to believe that the raiſing of Tumults, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Seditions, Stirs and Noiſes is a legal way to obtain their ends, as we know 'tis the Tenet and Principle of a great many people, what will they not do under that pretence, That all they do is according to Law? They think it is lawful by the Religion they profeſs to reſiſt and oppoſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the <hi>old Cauſe</hi> is a <hi>good Cauſe</hi> to this day in ſome mens Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and they can die in it, and thank God for being concerned in it. And there are ſome people that ſay the raiſing of Arms by the King's Authority againſt his Perſon is lawful by the Religion they profeſs, and they call themſelves <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> (how juſtly you may imagine) and if men will make Inſurrections to difficult the Government, it is Rebellion, and no man can juſtifie it, let him pretend Conſcience or what he will, 'tis rank Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It is not ſaying, I am thus perſuaded in my Conſcience that will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Man, if I ſteer my ſelf by the Dictates of a good and regular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it can never be thought that I ſhall commit Treaſon but it is the effect of evil Principles.</p>
               <p>Was it not under the ſhape of <hi>Religion,</hi> That that bleſſed Martyr King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of ever bleſſed memory came to the Block; nay, and I have heard of ſome men in the late times that were ingaged on that ſide, who finding that the King did prevail at the beginning of the War, becauſe he had Gentlemen of Quality and Spirit to appear for him, were at a loſs to know which way in the World they ſhould put a Spirit into the common people to oppoſe the King; and ſome among them bid them be ſure to put <hi>Religion</hi> to be but the pretence, and that would make them run headlong to what they would have them. Whoſe Opinion that was is not ſtrange to any that know any thing of the Hiſtory of thoſe times. So that when once people take it to be the Principle of their Religion to oppoſe and reſiſt all that are not of their perſuaſion, and for Religion ſake to reſiſt Authority, then they think all is lawful they can do to preſerve their Religion as long as they are wound up to that Opinion.</p>
               <p>Their next Witneſs, Gentlemen, is my Lord of <hi>Clare,</hi> and he gives you an account of his Diſcourſe with my Lord <hi>Howard.</hi> And by the way I muſt obſerve what I am very ſorry for with all my heart, To hear that among Gentlemen of Quality and Honour Diſcourſes of the Government and the Male-Adminiſtration of it as they think ſhould be onely matter of Jeſt fit for their recreation, and laughter, onely merry Table-talk, as though Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſo ſacred a thing were as mean as any trivial Concern whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. I am ſorry to hear and ſee that Perſons of great Honour and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſhould eſteem it ſo. And I muſt be pardoned if I take notice of it: for matters of Government and yielding Obedience to Superiours is a matter of Religion, 'tis a ſerious matter, and every Man ought to make Conſcience of it. To talk of Government with Reverence as well as pay Duty and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to it. And when I find it made a Jeſt I muſt be permitted to ſay that is not ſo well done, and whoever it is that makes it ſo ought very much to be blamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:58199:26"/>My Lord of <hi>Clare</hi> comes and teſtifies, That my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> told him, He did not believe my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was guilty of what he was accuſed of, much leſs did he believe it of Col. <hi>Sidney,</hi> and when he began to talk about Writings found in <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Cloſet, he ſaid, there can be nothing of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings found that can do him or any Man elſe any hurt. This is the ſubſtance of what that Noble Lord has ſaid.</p>
               <p>Then there is my Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and he likewiſe gives an account, That he had ſome Diſcourſe with my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> about the Plot; and he told him too, That he did not believe any thing of this <hi>Plot,</hi> or that my Lord <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> and others accuſed had any hand in it. But I would obſerve this one thing upon my Lord <hi>Paget</hi>'s teſtimony, That ſtill my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was wiſh'd joy by every body, and I am glad to ſee your heels at liberty, and the like. So that there was ſome jealouſie of his being concerned; ſome thing or other there was in it. Says my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> I look upon my ſelf as affronted that any body ſhould talk ſo of me. He was concerned that they ſhould ſuſpect him. But ſomething there was at the bottom. Says my Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> I am glad to hear you are out of it. For he began to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine there muſt be ſome fire for all this ſmoak. That, Gentlemen, was the Diſcourſe he had with him. But he ſays, That with my Lord <hi>Paget</hi> there were Diſcourſes of his going beyond Sea, but he did not go.</p>
               <p>Then comes Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> and he tells you, That there were Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made to him, and he has got the ſame words as the <hi>French</hi> Man had, That he did it with lifted up eyes and hands, he profeſſed ſolemnly he was altogether a ſtranger to any ſuch thing. The Dr. ſays, He had heard there was a Plot, and was perſuaded of the truth of it, but he was a little ſhaken by what my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> ſaid to him. But now he is ſufficiently ſatisfied there is a Plot, and I am glad he is, for I think it ſcarce does remain a doubt with any Men that have any value for the Religion and Government we live under. And I know not how they could be better ſatisfied than by the Evidence that has been given of it, a main part of which was given by my Lord <hi>Howard.</hi> All this was before my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was taken.</p>
               <p>Then comes in one Mr. <hi>Gisborne,</hi> and he tells you the ſame Story, That a great while ago my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> told him he knew nothing of the Plot.</p>
               <p>The next to him is Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> and he tells you, That after ſuch time as the Plot was diſcovered, and after my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was tryed, and after my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> had given Evidence at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> he ſhew'd him the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for his Pardon, and <hi>Blake</hi> telling him that was not ſufficient without an actual Pardon; He replyed, I think in my Conſcience I ſhall not have a Pardon till the drudgery of Swearing is over. But is that any argument? Here is a Man under the drudgery of Swearing; therefore he did not know any ſuch thing as he ſwears. It carries thus much along with it, That it was uneaſie to him, and there is a kind of a force put upon him to ſwear as they ſay in order to his Pardon.</p>
               <p>But now, Gentlemen, that will admit of this Anſwer, and a plain one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is, When a Man comes over and over again to tell the World ſuch a ſtory and give ſuch an account of himſelf, it muſt a little grate upon him though it be his duty to tell the truth, and though as Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſays, He is the beſt Martyr that is a Martyr for Truth; even ſo ſay I on the other ſide, he is the beſt penitent that is a penitent for Truth, and he is the beſt Witneſs that is a Witneſs for truths ſake, and he gives the beſt teſtimony of his repentance that by his teſtimony declares the truth though it be harſh and uneaſie to him; For if I have any ingenuity, and have lived in good credit in the World, it muſt be a drudgery and irkſom thing to call my ſelf
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58199:26"/>
a Traytor ſo often in a Court of Juſtice. It is true, he might have given it a more moderate Term, and yet withal upon theſe circumſtances he might have reaſon to call it in ſome ſenſe a Drudgery. But now, Gentlemen, As he did ſwear it before he had his pardon from time to time upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when he was called as a Witneſs. So now the Pardon is come, which they would have to be the reaſon of the continuance of his Drudgery he ſwears the ſame thing. He has his pardon under the King's Seal, and though it might be thought they would keep him within the compaſs of his Tether till he had done his Evidence; now he has got that he deſired he ſwears the ſame thing. And now his pardon does not at all influence his teſtimony, he is not under any fear, but is as free as any Subject the King has, and now he is upon his Oath, he gives you the account you have had, and he did ſay all the ſame things before ſuch time as Col. <hi>Sidney,</hi> my L. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> were tryed that he ſays now.</p>
               <p>Then, Gentlemen, you have in the next place Witneſſes called, ſeveral of them to give you an Account of the Converſation and diſpoſition of Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>; for ſays Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> for a man to be guilty of a Crime of this nature there muſt be ſome kind of evil diſpoſition to it, and ſo Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> would argue and make this inference. You ſee he is not a man of a turbulent, ſeditious and factious Spirit and temper, he is a ſtudious perſon, very retired, that has been beyond Sea much, and came not home till ſuch a time. And if there were interlocutions between my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> and my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> it was before he came into <hi>England,</hi> and ſo he was not concerned in them. He ſays, That <hi>March</hi> laſt he was to go again, he had a mind to return again to <hi>France</hi> for his health, and what reaſon have we to imagine he ſhould concern himſelf in the Plot? When he was ſo ſtudious a Man, lived ſo retired a life, and intended to go abroad ſo ſuddenly. And for this you have my Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pelham.</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Hobart,</hi> Dr. <hi>Lupee,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Juſtel,</hi> and one <hi>Murray.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, I beg your pardon. Well then, theſe others tell you, They have been perſons very intimately converſant with him, they never knew he concerned himſelf with any thing about Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but was of a quiet peaceable demeanor, and was ſo far from that which the Indictment talks of Turbulency and Sedition, that they never had any diſcourſe with him about any ſuch thing at all, ſave what Dr. <hi>Lupee</hi> ſays, who it ſeems lived with him about two years, and kept him Company in his Studies, and that once having ſome diſcourſe about the Popiſh Plot; He ſaid he would venture his Life and any thing he had to preſerve the King and Government againſt that Plot; he did very well, and if he had ſince declared, he would have ventured his life to have ſecured the King and Government, againſt this Plot, I ſhould have been glad to find him of that mind, I pray God you may find him to be ſo. But from the Evidence even of that <hi>French</hi> man, it ſeems there was ſome Jealouſie in the World, and that he lay under hard Cenſures as well as other people. For ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Plot the Advice given him was this. My Lord <hi>Grey</hi> is gone and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> is gone, why won't you go? Why ſhould that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice be given, if there were no ſuſpition of his being concerned. That he ſaid <hi>I will not go,</hi> and ſo they would make his ſtaying here to be an inſtance and proof of his innocence; Why Gentlemen, If that ſhould be ſo, then there was the ſame innocency in my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and Col. <hi>Sidney,</hi> and all of them: for all the Council of Six every one of them ſtay'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and he indeed did abſcond. And the ſame Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58199:27"/>
that made the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> fly, and my Lord <hi>Eſſex</hi> out his own throat convicted my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and Col. <hi>Sidney,</hi> and is now brought againſt the Defendant, and has from time to time been given againſt the reſt. We know no reaſon that they had to ſtay more than <hi>Weſt</hi> or <hi>Romſey</hi> had to ſtay and be taken, and yet that is not uſed by them as an argument of their innocency.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Evidences that have been given on the Defendants part; and I tell you as I go along what Anſwers are given to it on the part of the King. As to what is ſpoken of his intention to go again into <hi>France,</hi> if he deſigned to go, why did he not go before all this miſchief broke out? He came here at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and I may ſay he came it may be at an unlucky time, when the City and its Neighbourhood was in a Diſtemper, and ſome Men were blown with fears and jealouſies. Theſe might animate him, and inſpirit him as they did other people, and put them into a ferment; but you find him attending in Town conſtantly here till the matter was diſcovered, whatſoever his intentions were, 'tis much he did not put them into Action, 'tis ſtrange he did not go all this while, it had been much for his advantage That he had never come out of <hi>France,</hi> or that he had returned thither much ſooner.</p>
               <p>Againſt all this that has been urged for the Defendant about my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> I will tell you, what is the Anſwer to it; and truly firſt I ſay, I am apt to believe my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> did tell theſe Gentlemen what they here teſtifie; but was it ever thought That any Man that was guilty of High Treaſon would preſently proclaim his own guilt? Is it reaſonable to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> would tell Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> I am in a Plot, and Col. <hi>Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> is in a Plot, and Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> is in a Plot, and make it his Common talk; nay, it is ſo far from being an Argument of his Innocency, That more naturally it may be turned upon them as an Argument of his Guilt. For if a Man had not been concerned in the buſineſs at all, but were an honeſt Man, and free from ſuſpition, what need I talk or concern my ſelf to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim my own innocency not being accuſed? Why muſt I tell Col. <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Footman, This Man, the other Man, That I know nothing of the Plot, and neither I nor any other Man I am ſure is concerned in it? But that ſhews there was a dread and apprehenſion upon him of ſomething that he was conſcious of, and that lying within muſt have ſome vent, and this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Caution is an intimation that there was ſomething more than ordinary in the matter. We take notice of it as a great Evidence againſt a Man that is accuſed for an High-way Man, if he comes to ſuch an Ale-houſe or Inn, and bids the People take notice I am here at ſuch a time of the day, and that is a circumſtance of time that will ſerve to anſwer a proof, it may be that may be brought againſt him of a Robbery done ſuch a time; but we always look upon that induſtry of theirs as a piece of Artifice deſigned to patch up a teſtimony to evade a proof. So that the Argument will turn the other way; and 'tis more for the advantage of theſe worthy Gentlemen, that it ſhould be turned the other way, for otherwiſe they would be thought to be Perſons ill-affected to the Government; that is Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> my Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> my Lord <hi>Clare,</hi> and the reſt. And if they have a mind to be thought otherwiſe, they muſt let the Argument run that way as I ſay, and in Charity we ought to believe the beſt of all mankind till we find otherwiſe by them. We ſay then in Charity, We ſuppoſe He thought it not fit to intruſt you with his Confeſſions; for you are all Loyal Men, I know 'tis the beſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that can be given, and that which they ought to value themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their own credit and reputation, and not to make it an Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58199:27"/>
my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> or againſt the credibility of his teſtimony in the metter.</p>
               <p>I don't know truly, Gentlemen, That I have omitted any one thing that is material, on the one ſide or on the other, of which there hath been any proof, but I muſt onely repeat to you this, Here is a matter of great concern and Conſequence, a matter wherein the peace of the Government and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is concerned in a very high degree, a matter, that if there were another Witneſs as poſitive againſt the Defendant as my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> would amount to no leſs than High Treaſon. But as there is but one Witneſs backed with theſe Circumſtances to corroborate his teſtimony, 'tis but onely a Treſpaſs, but I tell you it treads very nigh upon High Treaſon, and the tendency of it was to bring us all into Confuſion and what would be the conſequence of that but to lay us open to the ſame miſchiefs that we were under in the times of the late Rebellion. For though Men pretend never ſo fair, and vail it under the names of the <hi>Security of the Government and the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> yet they would have done well to have tarried till they had a legal Authority to call them to conſult of theſe High matters that they pretend to ſecure, that had been well. What had theſe Gentlemen to do to take upon themſelves this Power without Authority?</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, You have heard the Evidence, and you ſee what it is. And I muſt ſay, in the late Evidences you have had concerning another buſineſs of this nature, I wiſh that might be ſaid to preſerve and ſupport the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of ſome Perſons upon whoſe teſtimonies Lives have been taken away as has been ſaid, and is evident for the advantage of my Lord <hi>Howard.</hi> I do not find that he has been guilty of Perjury, as being concerned in taking Oaths one way and then giving Evidence another. I mean, firſt taking Oaths of Secreſie and then revealing; not but that notwithſtanding all this, They may be believed, and God forbid but they ſhould be believed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to truth. But I ſay, if Objections of this nature are to prevail we muſt never expect any great Crime to be puniſhed, becauſe we muſt ſtay till Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are ſtrangers to the guilt of the Fact come to give Evidence of it, which is impoſſible to be done.</p>
               <p>Therefore, Gentlemen, I muſt reſolve it all into one Head; You have the Caſe of a Gentleman of Quality on the one ſide, and the peace and preſervation of the Government on the other ſide. You hear what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt him, the Evidence given on his behalf, the Objections that have been made by the Counſel, which all of them as near as I can remember I have repeated to you, and I ask your pardon and theirs if I have omitted any thing, and I deſire to be minded of it. You hear the Anſwers that have been given. And becauſe the Counſel were unwilling to give the Court trouble or themſelves to make long Speeches and Obſervations, Therefore I have been neceſſitated to do it as well I can.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter, My Lord <hi>Howard</hi> has thus poſitively ſworn the matter of Fact charged in the Indictment againſt the Defendant; he has been ſupported by the Witneſſes that confirm the circumſtances of <hi>Smith</hi>'s going into <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi>-Men's being here in <hi>June,</hi> and the Sham and Cant. of <hi>Carolina.</hi> All which you have heard, and I make no queſtion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and is not contradicted by any thing I hear that carries any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of an Anſwer. Therefore, Gentlemen, I leave it to you, whether upon this Evidence you will take it upon your Conſciences and Oaths, That my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> is Guilty of wilful and corrupt Perjury, Then you muſt find the Defendant not Guilty; But if you think he has proved the matter fully, and his teſtimony is ſupported by thoſe four Witneſſes, <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:58199:28"/>
Sir <hi>Andrew Foſter, Sheriff,</hi> and <hi>Bale,</hi> Then Gentlemen, you muſt find the Defendant Guilty.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I need not aggravate the hainouſneſs of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; for it appears both by the Information, and upon the Evidence to be beyond all Aggravation, wherefore I ſhall onely pray your Judgment for the King, That you would pleaſe to ſet a good Fine upon him, and that he find Sureties for his good behaviour during his Life.</p>

               <p>Yes, my Lord, they are out.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, what ſay you for Mr. <hi>Hambden?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> does attend here according to the Condition of his Recognizance, and ſince Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> hath prayed your Judgment, I ſhall not ſtir any thing as to the Indictment or the Verdict, but all I have to ſay for him is this, Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> is but Heir apparent, his Father is alive; and ſo though he has the proſpect of a good Eſtate, yet he has but little at preſent in poſſeſſion; Your Lordſhip knows what <hi>Magna Charta</hi> ſays, That there ſhould be a <hi>Salvo Contenemento</hi> in all Fines, and how far that may be an ingredient into your Lordſhips Judgment, I leave to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>For that matter I cannot tell what his Eſtate is, I have no knowledg of him, nor of his Eſtate whether it be great or ſmall, but Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> knows very well, That the Crime in Conſcience as well as Law in caſe it had been proved by two Witneſſes, would not only have wrought a forfeiture of all his Eſtate, but a forfeiture of his Life too, and all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, would have baſtardized his Children, would have attainted and corrupted his bloud. So that there is no ſort of imagination but that the Crime was High enough of Conſcience; and certainly deſerves, if we can impoſe it adequate to its deſert a very great puniſhment. Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> nor his Counſel can deny but that they had a fair and a full hearing, They
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58199:28"/>
had the liberty to ſay and prove all that they could, and you cannot but ſay Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> was very fair in making ſeveral Conceſſions that he might very lawfully and rightly inſiſted upon. So that there can be no Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that kind. I am ſorry That Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> a Gentleman of good Quality as he is by Birth, though he be a Perſon I never ſaw before he came here the laſt day of the laſt Term upon his <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> that I know of. I ſay, I am ſorry one of his Quality and Education, a ſtudious Perſon as it ſeems by his own natural inclination, and a learned Man ſhould be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily engaged in a deſign of this horridly evil nature. But on the one ſide as well as we muſt take care of the Subject, ſo on the other we muſt take care of the Government. Here was a deſign of deſtroying the King, and ſubverting the Government and bringing all into confuſion. Of this Deſign the Defendant is convicted, and we muſt take care to proportion the puniſhment, and according to our Conſciences and Oaths, and as we ought to have regard to the Offender, ſo alſo we are to have regard to the Government that he has offended.</p>

               <p>Ay, It was never meant of Fines for great Offences.</p>
            </sp>
            <stage>Then the Judges conſulted together.</stage>

               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> You know you are convicted of a very great Offence as great an Offence as can be I think committed, unleſs it were High Treaſon. For the matter of it would have made you Guilty, if there had been two Witneſſes. It was for conſpiring to levy War againſt His Majeſty, and for conſpiring to raiſe an Inſurrection and Rebellion within the Kingdom, a Conſpiracy of which ſome other Perſons being lawfully convicted, they have ſuffered death for it. You are a Perſon of an extraordinary good Family. and I am ſorry one of your Family that has flouriſhed ſo long and through ſo many Generations in great honour and reputation, and great proſperity under the Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould come to conſpire to deprive that King of his Government, whoſe Anceſtors have protected and defended your Family, and to ſpoil that Monarchy that has been the fountain of ſo much proſperity and honour to it. I am ſorry it comes to my turn to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Sentence of the Court upon you, Mr. <hi>Hambden.</hi> I have not any perſonal knowledg of you, but I have heard of you, and heard here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore very well of you. You have had a good Education and the Report of a learned and ingenuous Perſon, which makes me yet wonder the more that you ſhould engage in ſuch a horrid Deſign as this was. Indeed Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> I am ſatisfied no Fine can be too great, if any can be great enough for ſuch an Offence. We cannot take cognizance what your Eſtate is, 'tis reported there is a great Eſtate in your Family, it has been always repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be ſo.</p>
            </sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>I have nothing but for life, and that is but little neither.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>J. Wythens.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I know not what it is truly, Sir. But it was always reported to me to be a very great Eſtate, but whatſoever it is, we are to look after the proportioning the Puniſhment as near as we can to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. My Lord, and the Court have conſidered of the matter, and they think fit to give this Judgment upon you.</p>
            </sp>
            <stage>They ſet the Fine of Forty Thouſand Pounds upon you to be paid to the King, and you muſt be committed till you pay it.</stage>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>If you will apply your ſelf to the King, you may, and there perhaps you may find mercy; we muſt according to the duty of our Places and Oaths give ſuch Judgment as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Juſt. Withins.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Ay, In God's Name. You are in the King's hands, and he may do what he pleaſes in it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>If a Crime of this nature ſhould have a little puniſhment, it might encourage Offenders, and if we were to judg according to ſome Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts that have been given here for leſs Offences, where Gentlemen have given very much greater damages than thi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Fine amounts to, this would be thought a moderate Fine. I am ſorry any Man ſhould bring himſelf into theſe Circumſtances: The King as he is the Fountain of Juſtice, ſo he is alſo of Mercy, and you and all the reſt of his Subjects have cauſe to bleſs God that you live under a Monarch that is very merciful. No doubt, If you give a good account of your Contrition and ſorrow for your great Offence, and decently apply your ſelf to the King, he will think of ſhewing mercy to you; but Juſtice is our Work that are Judges; and according to the methods of Juſtice we think we cannot inflict leſs than we have done.</p>
