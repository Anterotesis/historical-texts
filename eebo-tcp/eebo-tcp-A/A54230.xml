            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>UPon the receipt of your laſt Letter, I was, at firſt, a little troubled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv the cenſorious Judgment you paſs upon my Politics, in reference to the grand buſineſs of Liberty of Conſcience. But after a little conſideration I comforted my ſelf. For I not onely remembred your conſtant favorable regard towards thoſe of different Perſwaſions from yours, but I obſerved alſo, even in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Letter, that you agree with me in this Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108150:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Principle, That <hi>no Man ought to be Perſecuted for Matters of meer Religion.</hi> And this agreement in ſo great a Principle made me hope that, notwithſtanding our preſent Difference, it would be no hard matter for you and me to agree in our particular Concluſions, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in our Conduct. To procure that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement there is nothing requiſite but <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Senſe.</hi> Let us but examin thorowly whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Principle leads, and let us be tru to the reſult of our own Examinations, and the Work wil be don.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ſo ſtrict a ſubjection as this to the conſequences of that Principle, however juſt and reaſonable in it ſelf, may ſeem unto you a little unſeaſonable in this Conjuncture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay, I muſt acknowledg to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I my ſelf alſo am not ſo much Maſter of my Paſſions, as to let Reaſon have always that abſolute Dominion that belongs to it. The fear of being deceived, by a Party of Men who plead for Liberty, makes me ſomtimes doubtful in determining upon the practice of what I acknowledg to be a Duty. I am convinced that the <hi>Intereſt Of this Nation,</hi> as wel as the <hi>Laws of Chriſtianity,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108150:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an <hi>Abſolute, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, Equal, and Invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Liberty of Conſcience.</hi> Nothing that dos not tend to the Ruin of the Government, or to the Prejudice of the People, which is but one and the ſame thing, ſhould be made the occaſion of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Reſtraint upon any Man. But where I ſee ground to fear that the granting of this Liberty ſhould ſerv onely to put a Power into their Hands that now demand it, wherby they may be able hereafter to take it away from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, truly in that caſe I am apt to heſitate upon the Point; or to ſay better, I confeſs that I heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate not at al. For I would by no means that a ſpecious hope of Chriſtian Liberty ſhould betray the Nation into a New Unchriſtian Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>Thus far I am ſure I agree with you. We would have <hi>Liberty with Security of its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: not otherwiſe.</hi> Now I intreat you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin whether or no, in the reſt, you agree with me. I ask then, If ſo be it can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated that the Penal Laws, and Teſts too, may be taken away without expoſing the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to any hazard of Perſecution by the <hi>Roman Catholics</hi>; Nay, if a <hi>far better Security</hi> may be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108150:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
provided againſt that Perſecution than thoſe preſent Laws and Teſts do afford us; wil it not be an Act of Equity and Wiſdom, as wel as Chriſtianity, in that caſe, to aboliſh them? This Security being ſuppoſed, nothing can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from complying with that Deſign, but ſuch Conſiderations as ariſe from the <hi>Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Ambition</hi> of ingroſſing al Honorable and Profitable Imployments unto our ſelvs, and thoſe of our own Perſwaſion. But wil any Conſiderations of that Nature, when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with a Public Intereſt and an avowed Duty, be juſtifiable, or even excuſable, either before God or Man? I cannot doubt but your determination in that Point wil be the ſame with mine. Thoſe Conſiderations are too ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did to be of any weight with an Honeſt Mind.</p>
            <p>Your Objection, I know, in reading theſe Queſtions, wil ariſe from a <hi>Diffidence</hi> that any new Security of this nature, either wil or can be granted us. There indeed perhaps you and I may differ in our opinions. But however, to com as near as we can, I wil at preſent ſuſpend my own Hopes, and concurring with your Doubts, conſider onely what is our Duty, and the Duty
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108150:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of al honeſt Men, even in this ſuppoſed doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conjuncture.</p>
            <p>An Example in the like caſe, not many years ago, when the Nation was in as great a ferment as it is now, may direct us. Thoſe that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there could be no other real Security, againſt the fears that poſſeſt them, than that <hi>Odious Bil of Excluſion</hi> which they promoted in Parliament, profeſſed nevertheleſs their conſtant willingneſs to liſten unto any Expedients that ſhould be offered for that purpoſe. If they did not then comply with any of thoſe Expedients, it was the heat of Faction that hindred them; and they have ſince on al occaſions acknowledged their Error. Let us therfor profit by their Example. Let us imitate them in that reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſpoſition which they profeſt, and be careful to avoid thoſe heats which cauſed their actual miſcarriage.</p>
            <p>In a word, let us, at leaſt, <hi>put the Thing to a Trial.</hi> Let it be referred to the Wiſdom of a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> to weigh the <hi>Expedients</hi> that may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or offered for our Security. Let <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Men</hi> be choſen into that Parliament; and not ſuch as ar ingaged, by along habit of Perſecuting,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108150:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to keep up the preſent Penal Laws, as Tools already fitted for their hands. Til we be called to that <hi>Election-Work,</hi> let us each of us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to diſpoſe our Selvs, diſpoſe One Another, and as occaſion offers diſpoſe our Friends, to that <hi>Spirit of Wiſdom and Moderation</hi> which is now ſo neceſſary. And til this Buſineſs have been weighed in Parliament, let us a little <hi>ſuſpend</hi> our Judgment upon it, and have always a great care that we <hi>obſtruct not the Good we deſire</hi> by heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any doubtful Jealouſys to an irreconcilable Extremity.</p>
            <p>Theſe ar the Rules of my Politics, which I hope you wil now look upon a little more favorably then you ſeemed to do in your laſt Letter. At preſent I wil trouble you no further. But if what I have now ſaid prove acceptable, I ſhal be very ready, upon your deſire, to explain further my inmoſt thoughts upon any the niceſt Circumſtances of this great Affair.</p>

            <head>The Second LETTER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am heartily glad that my laſt Letter has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you any meaſure of Satisfaction. But I perceiv by your new Quaerys, that I have ingaged my ſelf, in the cloſe of that Letter, to a greater Task than I was aware of. It is not enough to have ſatisfy'd you ſo far as I have gon, but I muſt either continu to anſwer your new Difficultys, or elſe joyn with you in owning them to be unanſwerable. I muſt either ſhew you the very <hi>Expedients</hi> that may be contrived for ſecuring us againſt any future Perſecution by the <hi>Roman Catholics,</hi> or elſe acknowledg that no ſuch thing either can or wil be don. That is a little hard. The thing may be felzable, tho I ſhould not be able to demonſtrate it. Others may know more than I can. Nay, indeed the truth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108150:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is that I know ſo little, and others have already ſaid ſo much upon this Subject, that, as I cannot pretend to make any new Diſcoverys in it, ſo neither am I willing to repeat juſt the ſame things that you have read elſ-where: And between thoſe two Difficulties I am ſomthing ſtraitned in complying with what you deſire. Nevertheleſs ſince I am ingaged, I wil rather hazard to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what may have been hinted at already by others, than refuſe to explain unto you my own Conceptions.</p>
            <p>The Security we demand muſt be conſidered either as it lys naturally <hi>in the thing it ſelf</hi>; I mean in the <hi>Repeal</hi> of al Old Penal Laws and Teſts, and in the <hi>Sanction</hi> of a New Great Charter for Liberty of Conſcience; or elſe as it may be fortify'd by ſuch <hi>Expedients</hi> as the Wiſdom of a <hi>Parliament</hi> may think ſit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, and His <hi>Majeſtys Goodness</hi> may vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to grant.</p>
            <p>But this laſt Conſideration belongs not to my Province. It becoms not private Perſons to anticipate. Parliamentary Deliberations, much leſs to preſcribe Rules unto His Majeſtys Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. It ſuffices me, in that reſpect, to know
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108150:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that His Majeſty has been pleaſed, <hi>by often rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated Promiſes,</hi> to aſſure us that he wil concur with his Parliament, in any thing that may be reaſonably offered for the Eſtabliſhment of ſuch <hi>a Law of Chriſtian Liberty as may never be broken.</hi> I am not curious to pry further into thoſe matters, until His Majeſty ſhal think fit in his Wiſdom to diſcloſe unto the Nation the Treaſures of his Goodneſs. And to ſpeak freely to you, as a Friend, I am yet the leſs curious about it at this time, nor any ways impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to know more, until a Parliament may be ready to deliberate thereupon; becauſe I know already, that there ar a ſort of Men in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who watch upon every occaſion, with al the Arts that Malice can invent, to blaſt any thing that ſhal be offered for the advancement of this Chriſtian Deſign. Leaving therfore the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this <hi>Acceſſional Security</hi> that we look for, I wil now apply my ſelf to conſider onely what proſpect of Security the thing it ſelf dos <hi>in its own Nature</hi> afford us.</p>
            <p>When we diſcourſe about this Security, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we both of us underſtand it onely with relation to the hazard that may ariſe from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108150:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
taking away the Teſts. For as to the Penal Laws, ſingly conſidered, I think al Men that have Souls large enough (as I am ſure you have) to prefer the <hi>general Good</hi> of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try before the <hi>narrow Advantages</hi> of a Party, wil agree that it is no leſs the Intereſt of this Nation to aboliſh them, than the Duty of al Mankind to forbear Perſecution.</p>
            <p>There is no hazard in the aboliſhment of thoſe Penal Laws. Now what the hazard may be in aboliſhing the Teſts, wil be beſt perceived by conſidering the effect of their impoſition. The effect, in which the Proteſtant Intereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, is that the <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> ar thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from al <hi>Places of Public Truſt,</hi> either Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or Military. This, I ſhould have ſaid, is the Intent of them. But how far the real Effect fals ſhort of that Intent, and how far it muſt needs fal ſhort therof in the Reign of a Catholic Prince, is too evident to need any demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nevertheleſs, ſuppoſing that the <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> were indeed therby debard from entring into any Public Imployments, What is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that Proteſtants, or that the Nation in general, pretend to receiv by their Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108150:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I know you wil tel me that we have therby our Security againſt that Principle of <hi>Perſecution</hi> which we think inſeparably joyned to <hi>their Religion.</hi> They wil not be able to impoſe their Religion upon us, nor perſecute us for not receiving it. That is the tru End, and we wil ſuppoſe it to be real Effect, of the Teſts.</p>
            <p>You do not pretend ſure that the Excluſion of the Roman Catholics from ſuch Imployments is any Security to our <hi>Civil Rights,</hi> or to the <hi>Fundamental Conſtitution</hi> of our Government. They ar Engliſh Men as wel as we. The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Rights of Engliſh Men ought to be no leſs dear to them than to us. And if any malicious Surmizer ſhould preſume to imagin that His Majeſty had a deſign to raiſe his own Prerogative upon the ruin of the Peoples Libertys, we have reaſon to believ, by many paſt inſtances, that Men of another Religion, much more numerous and powerful than the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, would be found no leſs ready Inſtruments, but far more proper ones, for the effecting of that work. The beſt defence that I know againſt thoſe imaginary fears, and the moſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108150:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
becoming dutiful Subjects, is to comply chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with his Majeſty in al things reaſonable; that ſo an unreaſonable Refuſal may not force him upon new Methods, and make us feel in the end what we ar perhaps too ſlow to conceiv, that <hi>Omnia dat qui juſta negat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I return to the conſideration of our being ſecured againſt Perſecution by the Excluſion of the Roman Catholics from Public Imployments. In very good time, that the <hi>Church of England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> now looks for ſuch a Security! I am ſure others have not been ſecured againſt it, by the public adminiſtration of Her Members. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, let us conſider how it is that the Teſts ſecure us, or how it is that they hinder them from entering into thoſe Imployments. It is not as a Wal or Barricado that confines them to a certain Incloſure, out of which they cannot move; nor is it as a Charm or Spel that, by any Magic Vertu, hinders them from acting. It is onely as <hi>a Law,</hi> which, by the penalty annexed to it, aws their Minds, and makes them fearful to tranſgreſs it. They dar not enter into Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Offices, leſt they ſhould be puniſhed for the <hi>Breach of that Law</hi> which forbids them to do it.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108150:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But, pray, Who is it that ſhould puniſh them for that Offence? They know very wel that in this Reign they ar in no danger. That Law is now diſpenſed with. The onely Bridle ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that reſtrains them from tranſgreſſing it, is evidently the fear of its being Revived in the Reign for the next Succeſſor; becauſe it is a Law whoſe Penalty they wil be always liable unto, whenſoever the Government ſhal think fit to exact it.</p>
            <p>Now if this be the only Ground of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from Public Offices, and conſequenly of our pretended Security; I ſay if it be onely the <hi>Force of a Law</hi> that works that effect; pray let us conſider if <hi>another Law</hi> might not be contrived, to ſecure us much more effectually againſt Perſecution, that this Excluſion of them either dos or can do.</p>
            <p>Let us therfore have <hi>a Law</hi> enacted, which, in <hi>Aboliſhing al thoſe Penal Ones, and al the Teſts too</hi> that ar now complained of, ſhal <hi>Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal and Equal Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> as a Magna Charta of Religion, with al the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging Circumſtances that the Wit of Man can invent to make it inviolable. Let that <hi>Liberty</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:108150:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be declared to be the <hi>Natural Right of Al Men,</hi> and any violation therof be therfore accounted Criminal. Let not onely every <hi>Actual Infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of that Law, but every <hi>Motion, Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Contrivance,</hi> expreſt either in Word or Deed, tending any way to the invalidating of it, be eſteemed and declared an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndermining of the Fundamental Conſtitution of our Government,</hi> and accordingly to be puniſhable with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Severitys, even as <hi>Felony</hi> or <hi>Treaſon.</hi> Let the Extent of this Law reach <hi>al Conditions</hi> and <hi>al Degrees</hi> of Men, Eccleſiaſtical, Civil and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, from the higheſt Lord to the meaneſt Beggar. Let not <hi>future Parliaments</hi> themſelvs be exempted from the danger of infringing it; but let any Propoſition tending therunto, <hi>tho even in either Houſe of Parliament,</hi> be not onely reputed a Tranſgreſſion therof, but expreſly declared to be the higheſt and worſt of al Tranſgreſſions; and let no Parliamentary, or other <hi>Priviledg</hi> whatſoever extempt any ſuch Offender from the ſevereſt Puniſhment, no more than they can do it now from that of Treaſon. And after al this, and what more the Wiſeſt Heads may invent, let <hi>The
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108150:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
King</hi> himſelf be humbly beſeeched to ſuffer in it a Clauſe, by which, <hi>reſerving al other Rights of his Prerogative</hi> inviolated, he may ſolemnly <hi>renounce the onely Right of Diſpenſing with this Law, or of Pardoning any Tranſgreſſor of it in any caſe whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſing now that ſuch a Law as this ſhould be Enacted, I beſeech you to conſider if it do not anſwer the end of ſecuring us againſt Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, infinitely better than the preſent Teſts that exclude the <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> from Public Imployments. It wil <hi>ſecure,</hi> in the firſt place, <hi>al the Diſſenting Proteſtants</hi> from the preſent Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws, which the Teſts do not: And it wil indeed ſecure al Partys againſt al Perſecution, in every reſpect far better than they do. It wil do it in a <hi>direct manner</hi>: Wheras they work onely by a <hi>weak and ſtrained Conſequence.</hi> It wil do it upon the <hi>ſolid grounds of Religion, Truth and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>: Wheras they ar built onely upon <hi>precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, partial and unjuſt Principles.</hi> It wil be declared to be in its own Nature <hi>Indiſpenſable</hi>: Wheras they are every day <hi>diſpenſed with.</hi> It wil be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by a more <hi>ſolemn Sanction</hi>: And it wil be inforced by more <hi>awful and terifying Penaltys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:108150:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>Theſe Advantages, as you ſee, do al appear in the ſimpleſt proſpect that we can take of <hi>the thing it ſelf, in its own Nature</hi>; in the <hi>meer Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment,</hi> I mean, <hi>of the Laws of Perſecution, and the Eſtabliſhment of a Law of Liberty</hi>; without the help of any further <hi>Expedients.</hi> That is the onely thing that I propoſed to my ſelf to explain. And I cannot but now hope that even this expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, how imperfect ſoever it be, wil convince you that it is not ſo <hi>dangerous</hi> a Work to <hi>aboliſh the Teſts,</hi> nor ſo <hi>difficult</hi> to <hi>eſtabliſh a laſting Security againſt Perſecution,</hi> when thoſe Teſts ſhal be Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, as ſom People induſtriouſly endeavor to perſwade us. But I perceiv that I have been already too tedious upon this Argument.

            <head>The Third LETTER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce I have had the good fortune to pleaſe you the ſecond time, I am reſolved to try it a third. I have endeavored, as you have ſeen, to make it appear that it is not impoſſible to contrive a <hi>more Equitable and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nexceptionable</hi> Law than the Teſts, which wil ſecure us alſo <hi>infinitely better</hi> than they do, againſt the danger of being <hi>Perſecuted by the Roman Catholics.</hi> Now you anſwer me that this Law, tho it ſhould be conſented to, would be leſs Security to us againſt the Roman Catholics than the Teſts: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by it they would be admitted into the <hi>Legiſlative,</hi> as wel as <hi>Executive,</hi> parts of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; wheras by the other they ar wholly excluded from both. And an <hi>Excluſion,</hi> ſay you, eſpecially from the Legiſlative Power, is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108150:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a far better Security than any <hi>Regulation</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that can be made about their conduct in it: becauſe, when once admitted into that capacity, there wil be ſtil reaſon to apprehend leſt they ſhould break thro the Rules preſcribed for their Conduct, and change even the Laws themſelves at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>This is indeed very ſpecious. But I intreat you to conſider, in the firſt place, That the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi> we talk of by the Teſts is onely <hi>Imaginary,</hi> not <hi>Real.</hi> We pleaſe our ſelves with a Notion, while we ar fruſtrated of the Thing. A <hi>Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> diſſipates al that Bulwark into Duſt and Aire: While on the contrary the <hi>Regulation</hi> I have propounded is to be <hi>declared and made</hi> abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>Indiſpenſable.</hi> Which is no inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advantage on the ſide that I incline to.</p>
            <p>But this is not al. Your Objection prompts me to a further Defence of my Propoſition. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wil ſerve your turn but an <hi>Abſolute Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of thoſe that may have a minde <hi>to hurt us,</hi> from al manner of ſhare, either Legiſlative or Executive, in our Government. Be it ſo. I am very wel pleaſed to join Iſſu with you upon that Point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:108150:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>The <hi>Hurt</hi> we fear, and deſire to fence againſt, is <hi>Perſecution.</hi> Let us therfore, in God's name, exclude al <hi>Perſecuting</hi> Papiſts, and Proteſtants too, from thoſe Imployments. But let al thoſe that have a <hi>Spirit of Moderation and Charity,</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with other neceſſary Qualifications, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly admitted into them, whatſoever be their profeſſion of Religion. It is not the Notion of Tranſubſtantiation that hurts us. Why ſhould we therfore make that the ground of an Excluſion? Let us go to the tru Ground of the Matter, and do our Work at once, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
            <p>In a Word: Let <hi>this Act it ſelf,</hi> that we are projecting, be the <hi>Fundamental Teſt</hi> for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of al Perſons into al manner of Public Imployments, or for their Excluſion from them. Let every <hi>Member of both Houſes of Parliament,</hi> before they ar admitted to ſit there, be obliged to ſubſcribe a <hi>Declaration,</hi> importing That they <hi>ſolemnly profess, and, in the preſence of God, ſincerely acknowledg the natural Equity of this Great Law; and that they in like manner promis never to infringe it, nor either directly or indirectly to promote any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of undermining or invalidating it in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108150:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whatſoever.</hi> Let al thoſe that ſhal preſume to ſit in either Houſe, without having firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed that Declaration, be liable to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Penaltys that ſhal be annexed to the foreſaid Law. And let al <hi>future Acts</hi> (if any ſuch there ſhould be) paſſed by a Parliament not ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as by this Law ſhal be required, be declared <hi>Illegal and Nul.</hi> Nay further, if it may be thought any ſtrengthning to our Security, let alſo <hi>Al other Public Officers,</hi> as wel as the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, be obliged, upon their entrance into thoſe Offices, to ſubſcribe the ſame ſolemn Declaration, upon the hazard of the ſame Penalties, and of the Illegality and Nullity of al their Proceedings. Let al that Govern, or Teach, or any way Officiate <hi>in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Affaires,</hi> either in Church or Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle; Al <hi>Judges, Juſtices, Juries, Magiſtrates, Military Commanders</hi> both by Sea and Land, with al the Inferior and Subordinate Officers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon any of them, from the higheſt to the loweſt, be Al ſubject to the ſame Rule.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Teſt againſt Perſecution</hi> that we have been long ſince adviſed to, by One of the earlieſt and ſtrongeſt Writers upon this Subject; but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108150:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which the Nation ſeems not yet to have enough reflected upon. If this be not judged a ſufficient ſecurity, I wiſh thoſe that perceiv the defects of it would propound unto us any thing better. I ſhal be always for chuſing the beſt. But however, in the mean while, I think al Men muſt agree that, <hi>if it be indeed Perſecution that we deſire to fence againſt,</hi> this is infinitely a better ſecurity in that reſpect than the preſent Penal Laws and Teſts ar. And therfore, <hi>provided this may be granted,</hi> I cannot but yet hope that there wil appear to be among us Men Wiſe enough, and Honeſt enough, and thoſe too, Numerous enough, to ſway the Nation to conſent to their aboliſhing.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid already that, upon the ſuppoſition of this Security there can be nothing but private <hi>Ambition or Avarice</hi> capable to raiſe an oppoſition againſt this generous Deſign of Univerſal Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But ſurely no <hi>private</hi> Intereſt wil be capable to bear up long againſt the <hi>general</hi> Intereſt of the Nation. Now it has been often aſſerted by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and demonſtrated with great evidence, that thoſe whoſe Intereſt it is to deſire Liberty ar far more numerous than thoſe that oppoſe it. But if in that there ſhould at preſent be any miſtake,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108150:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I am ſure, when once this Liberty ſhal be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, it wil then be viſibly and indiſputably the Intereſt of al Partys to maintain it. Al the ſeveral Intereſts of the Nation wil be then drawn up into one Circle, and the Extremitys wil touch each other. The <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> how oppoſite ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in other reſpects, wil therby becom inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably cimented into one Common Caus. And, tho we ſhould ſuſpect the <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> to have contrary inclinations, yet the ſtrength of the others Union wil oblige them, for their own Safety, to concur in promoting the general Good.</p>
            <p>Yet for al this, I wil not ſtick to acknowledg that ſuch a ſuſpicion of an inclination to Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, <hi>in any that may be uppermoſt,</hi> is not altogether unreaſonable. The Examples of <hi>Perſecutions</hi> rais'd at one time or other, by <hi>al Partys</hi> that have had the power to do it, authorize thoſe Fears. But for that very reaſon, I ſay, that this is <hi>the fitteſt time</hi> that ever we can expect, to <hi>ſettle this Liberty</hi> in <hi>England</hi>: becauſe the <hi>Power</hi> is now in the Hands of the <hi>weakeſt Party,</hi> which is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaſt able to ſtrain it. And if once that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108150:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Settlement</hi> be made, the <hi>united Intereſt</hi> of al Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys in the Advantages it brings along with it, wil in human appearance <hi>ſecure</hi> it againſt the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ever being ſhaken hereafter.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations, you ſee, afford a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Proſpect of our Security in the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Law of Liberty; in that it wil be the Intereſt of al Partys to maintain it: And they afford alſo an Incitement to ſet about that Work; becaus of the ſeaſonableneſs of the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Which things deſerv exceedingly to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto. But after ſo palpable a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, as I think I have given, of that Security, in the frame of the Law it ſelf, I have no mind now to intertain you with any thing that may appear more ſpeculative, tho in effect it be no leſs ſolid.</p>
            <p>My meaning in this is, that I have ſhown onely the <hi>Poſſibility of this Security.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it wil be juſt granted in the manner that I conceiv it, is what I cannot anſwer for. <hi>I rather hope it wil be made much better.</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, after this plain appearance of the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the thing, I think I may reſume what I ſaid in my firſt Letter, as an Advice of ſom
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108150:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
weight; That, in this Conjuncture, it is both the <hi>Duty</hi> and the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the Nation to put this buſineſs to a <hi>Tryal,</hi> in a Grave and Moderate Parliament; and not by any means to make that impoſſible, by <hi>Faction, Jealouſy,</hi> or <hi>Deſpair,</hi> which ſeems eaſily obtainable by <hi>a prudent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this be our conſtant Aim, to have <hi>Liberty ſetled by a Law.</hi> That is the Mark that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhoot at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And I would be very loath that other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Errors, or Humors, ſhould make me miſs it. We ought Al to be ſingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> intent upon our own Duty; and if we keep ſo, we cannot fail to know it. Which way ſoever we turn our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, in theſe matters of Politics, they wil always bring us back to the ſame Center. The <hi>General Good</hi> is the Rule and Touch-Stone, by which al muſt be tryed and meaſured. That General Good can never be attended unto, much leſs procured, without the <hi>General Satisfaction</hi> of al Partys; Nor that Satisfaction without this <hi>Equal and General Liberty</hi> which I have been pleading for.</p>
            <p>Now therfore that every one may the more eaſily diſcern their own Duty, while we ar in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108150:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this evident poſſibility of obtaining ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual and ſecure Liberty; I would have the <hi>Church of England,</hi> in the firſt place, Conſider with how much Juſtice the Odium of <hi>a Self-intereſſed and ſordid Partiality,</hi> wil be caſt upon Her by al Men, in caſe She ſtil continu to obſtruct it. <hi>Let Her conſider that, and be Aſhamed.</hi> In the next place, If the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> ſhould ſuffer themſelvs to be fooled out of this Liberty, by the cunning of their Old Adverſarys; I would have them conſider how obnoxious they yet ly, even at this very hour, to the <hi>Redoubled Laſhes of the ſame Laws</hi> under which they have ſo long groaned. <hi>Let Them conſider that, and Tremble.</hi> And if the <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> ſhould ever attempt to overſtrain the Advantages they may receiv by this Liberty, when it ſhal be eſtabliſhed; I would have them Conſider that in gaping for the <hi>Shadow,</hi> they wil be in danger to loſe the <hi>Subſtance. Let Them conſider that, and be Wiſe.</hi> I have now don. Lonely again beg of you to pardon the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs of <hi>al theſe Conſiderations,</hi> and to believ me to be moſt ſincerely and affectionately</p>
