            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GOod Reader, there is a namelesse man come down from the Moone, who brings us strange newes of a late discoverie; to wit, of a world found there; This man of the Moone goeth about to perswade us, in a booke which he hath set out, come lately to my hands; that the world, ever since <hi>Adam,</hi> hath been in a dreame, in thinking that the heavens move, and the earth rests: He tells us another tale, to wit, that it is the earth that moveth, and the heavens stand still: He lieth in ambush, and from his darke lurking place, shoots abroad his arrowes; so that we can no more see him, then if he were in the Moone still; but it is a cowardly part to hide himselfe; and from the cloud, in which he is wrapt, to let fly his darts against me, and that Book which a few yeares agoe I wrote in Latine, in confutation of this new phantasticall Chimaera. My case is like that of <hi>Volscus</hi> in the Poet, who knew not whence those darts came that killed <hi>Sulmo</hi> and <hi>Tagus,</hi>
               <q>

               </q>
I might be thought, <hi>luctari cum larvis,</hi> to fight against shadowes, as <hi>AEneas</hi> did going down to hell.</p>
            <p>If I should make any reply to a namelesse disputer, but I am ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised however to answer him, least he should sing (<hi>iò triumphe</hi>;) and not to suffer by silence my reputation to be wounded, the truth prejudiced, and the Scriptures abused, with his idle glosses. Therefore here I present to thee the weaknesse and vanities of this mans conceits, as far as the shortnesse of time, and my other studies and affaires would permit me; which I pray thee accept in good part, and so farewell.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe title of this new book is a may be (that the Earth may be a Planet) but I say that may not be: For a Planet is a wandring starre, and the Earth is not a starre in its essence, nor a wanderer in its motion. And indeed you wrong our common mother, who so many thousand yeares hath been so quiet and stable, that now she should become a wonderer in her old age; but if she may be a Planet, tell us whether she may be one of the seven Planets, who are called <hi>Errones</hi> in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, (not for that they have an erroneous, but because they have a various mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) or whether she may be an eighth Planet, that so wee may make up our week of eight dayes; for why should not mother Earth have one day of the week, aswell as the other Planets, to carry her name? And so let there be <hi>dies terrae,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as <hi>dies Solis, &amp; Lunae,</hi> Earth day, aswell as Sunday, or Moonday; and whereas the Planets are moved according to the motion of the spheares, you had done us a pleasure, if you had told us the spheare in which the Earth moveth: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if the Earth be a Planet, and each Planet hath its period of time for finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its course: <hi>Saturne</hi> 30. yeares, <hi>Iupiter</hi> 12. <hi>Mars</hi> 2, &amp;c. What is the time which you will allot to the Earth for the accomplishing of her annuall motion? If it be true, that the lower the Planet is, the swifter it is in its annuall motion; as the Moon in 27. dayes, and 8. houres, doth finish her course, which <hi>Saturne</hi> ends not but in 30. yeares space; doubtlesse, this Earth-planet, being the lowest of all, must in a very short time expire its annuall race. Moreover, if the Earth be the eight Planet, <hi>Sol,</hi> who is the King of this planeticall Common-wealth, cannot have his throne in the midle, as Antiquity, and Truth too have placed hiw; for hee shall have three on his one hand, and four on the other, and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not impart his light equally to all. And whereas every one of the Planets hath his office in this Reipublick; to wit, <hi>Saturne</hi> the Counceller, <hi>Iupiter</hi> the Judge, <hi>Mars</hi> the Captaine, <hi>Venus</hi> the Steward, <hi>Mercury</hi> the Scribe or Chancellour, and the <hi>Moone</hi> the Messenger: Wee must needs finde out some office for the Earth, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise she will be counted idle, and none of the Planets. But that the Earth may be a Planet, is as true as that the Sun may be a burning stone, that there may be a man in the Moon, that there may be an infinite number of Suns and worlds, that the Stars and Planets may have had their first originall and being from the Earth, which have been the extravagant conceits of giddy headed Philosophers: But I remember what <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith of some may-bees or possibilities;<note place="margin">

               <p>I Had shewed how unreasonable it was, that an upstart novelty concerning the Earth's motion,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cont. Lans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergium, l.t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 20.</note> should thrust out a truth of so long continuance and universality, as this of the Earth's immobility. You answer, <hi>That wee must not so doat upon antiquity, as to count that Canonicall, which is approved by the consent of the Ancients.</hi> To this I answer: 1. Make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that your opinion of the Earth's motion is true, and ours false; and we will prefer yours, though new. 2. If you can make it appeare that your opinion is any waies usefull or advantageous, wee will admit it. 3. Suppose that both your and our opinion were but conjecturall, and that there were but an equall probability in both; yet you must not prefer, nor equall your opinion to ours, because we have antiquity and consent of all times, of all nations, of so many holy, wise, and learned men for us, which you want; in this respect then, if both our opinions were put in the balance, yours will be found too light, though you should adde to the scale that heavie Prussian <hi>Copernicus.</hi> 4. Though there were no hurt in your opinion, yet wee may not entertaine it; for the world is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered with too many opinions already; and a great many might be well spared. 5. But whereas your opinion is false, absurd, and dangerous, as we have partly shewed, and will shew afterwards,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49171:6"/>
wee were mad to receive it; having neither truth, reason, sense, consent, antiquity, or universality to countenance it. 6. That which you call the preserving of Philosophicall libertie, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the loosing of the reines to exorbitant wits, to run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into every kinde of absurdity. 7. Wee doe not inslave our selves to the opinion of any one man, (as you suppose we doe) but we are of the opinion of all men, of all times, and nations. You inslave your selfe to one man, and is guilty of that which you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse in us: <hi>Quis tulerit Gracchos?</hi> 8. Wee condemne not your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion because it is new, but because not true. A new falshood, a false novelty; and such a new deformed brat is to be choaked in the infancy: <hi>Principiis obsta</hi>; kill the Cockatrice in the egge. 9. You say it's but a novelty in Philosophy, but I say it intrencheth upon Divinity: for Divinity tells us, that the standing of the sun, and moving of the earth are the miraculous workes of Gods superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall power: your new Philosophy tells us, that they are the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary workes of Nature; and so this scope being granted, you may turn Divinity into naturall Philosophy, and confound the works of God, and of Nature. 10. You tell us, <hi>That Antiquity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the old age of the world, not in the youth of it.</hi> What Antiquity? Of the world? then you speak not properly, as you say you doe, but tautologically; the worlds old age consists in its old age. If you mean that your opinion is not new, but old, because the world is old, you speak absurdly: for old opinions are so called, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were found out in the youth, or in the old age of the world, but because they have continued a long time in the world; and so new opinions are new, though found out in the old age of the world. Opinions have no relation to the ages of the world, but to their owne continuance: Are you older then your great Grand-father, because the world is older now, than it was when hee lived? 11. <hi>You are the fathers (you say) in such learning as may be increased by experiments and discoveries, and of more authority then former ages.</hi> Why doe you not tell us plainly, that you are fathers of learning, as well as in learning? but indeed you are not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of learning, you are onely fathers of your new discoveries and fresh experiments; that is, of new, fond, and savourlesse phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: and why you must be of more authority then former ages, I see no reason. Shall not <hi>Iuball,</hi> and <hi>Tuball-Cain,</hi> the inventors and fathers of their Arts, be of as great authority, as you that are the fathers of such mishapen monsters, though they lived in the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49171:6"/>
and you in the old age of the world? Why should I rather credit you in telling us of a world in the Moon, and of the Earth, that it is a planet, then those wise men of former ages, who never dreamt of such idle and ridiculous conceits? You say, <hi>Truth is the daughter of time</hi>; so say I, but errors, heresies, falshoods, are times daughters too. We see how fruitfull this later age of the world is of new and frivolous opinions. But how much are you beholding to old mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time, who hath bestowed her eldest daughter, Truth, upon you, having past by so many worthy Suitors in all ages? this is a transcendent favour, you are <hi>homo perpaucorum hominum,</hi> and have been wrapped in your mothers smock. 12. <hi>In leaving us to our liberty, to accept or reject your opinion</hi>; I perceive you have no great confidence in your new married wife, Times daughter: you mistrust your cause, and the validity of your arguments; and that you have imployed your pen more to shew your wit, then to evince our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>You will not have this Philosophicall doubt decided by common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for they judge by their senses, nor yet by the holy Fathers, for they were ignorant</hi> (you say) <hi>in this part of learning. Aristotle</hi> you have already disabled, for his works are not necessarily true; and, I say, it is not fit that you should be Judges in your owne cause. Whom then will you name for Judges, seeing Scriptures, Fathers, senses, Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks, are rejected; reasons and arguments you have none: I think you must be faine to call for some of your people out of the Moon. <hi>Iuno Lucina. fer opem.</hi> But in calling of the Fathers igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants in this part of learning, you doe them wrong; for they were neither ignorant of Philosophy, nor of Astronomy; they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the idle opinions of both; amongst the rest, that of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes.</hi> For although I deny not the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> yet the<note n="*" place="margin">

In that they could not tell how these people came thither, seeing the vast ocean, beyond the straight of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> was not navigable; and they confessed that it could not be passed. 3. The reasons which they alledged to prove <hi>Antipodes</hi> were not demonstrative, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall, but meerly conjecturall; so that the Fathers could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no satisfaction from their reasons. 4. They held that those <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes</hi> were another race of men, then these of this hemisphere, and that they had been there perpetually; and that they neither could, nor ever should know what kind of men they were. 5. They did
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49171:7"/>
waver in their opinion, sometimes saying that the westerne people were <hi>Antipodes</hi> to us; sometimes the Southerne people; sometime confounding <hi>Antipodes</hi> and <hi>Antichthones.</hi> 6. They would neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily inferre from the roundnesse of the earth, that the lower he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere was dry earth, and inhabitated with people: the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which S. <hi>Austine</hi> denies. 7. They held that the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite earth to ours had an opposite motion. Of these, and other vaine opinions concerning <hi>Antipodes,</hi> you may see in <hi>Pliny, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, Macrobius, Lactantius, &amp;c.</hi> It was not then out of ignorance, or peevishnesse, but upon good grounds and reasons, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed <hi>Antipodes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>l. Categ. c.</hi> 10.</note> as the Philosophers esteemed of them. Otherwise S. <hi>Austin</hi> knew and acknowledged there might be <hi>Antipodes.</hi> 2. What though the Fathers or <hi>Aristotle</hi> had been ignorant in this point, must therefore their authority in other points be slighted? must their failing in one or two points of Philosophy, lessen their credit in all Philosophicall truths? What if they had been igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in some one point of Divinity, must we therefore reject their authority in other points? The Apostles were ignorant of the day of Judgement, and of some other points; yet wee beleeve them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a whit the lesse in all other points. 3. There is odds between denying of <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and denying the motion of the Earth, and standing of the Sun: For the reasons which Philosophers brought to prove <hi>Antipodes,</hi> were neither experimentall, nor demonstrative, nor any waies satisfactory; but for the stability of the earth, and motion of heaven, wee have both sense, reason, authority, divine and humane, consent, antiquity, and universality, as is said; and what can be wanting to confirme a truth, which wee have not to confirme this? 4. You say, <hi>That</hi> Solomon <hi>was strangely gifted with all kinde of knowledge:</hi> then would I faine know why hee did not plainly tell us, (being so great a Philosopher) that the Earth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that the Sun stood still; but quite contrary proves the transient vanity of humane affaires, from the earth's stability, and constant motion of the sun.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Iob,</hi> (you say) <hi>for all his humane learning, could not answer these naturall questions which God proposeth to him: as, Why the sea should be so bounded from overflowing the land. What is the breadth of the earth? What is the reason of snow or haile, raine or dew, yee or frost? which any ordinary Philosopher in these daies might have resolved. Answ.</hi> You would make <hi>Iob,</hi> who was both a King and a Priest, a very simple man, if wee would beleeve you. But how know you that <hi>Iob</hi> could
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49171:7"/>
not answer God? Mary, because hee sayes of himselfe, <hi>That hee uttered that, he understood not: things too wonderfull for him which hee knew not.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 42.3.</note> But, Good Sir, these words are spoken of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret waies of Gods providence, and of his hid and unsearchable judgements, which are these wonderfull things that <hi>Iob</hi> knew not nor understood; for his judgements are a bottomlesse depth, his waies are past finding out; and they are not spoken of naturall causes of meteors. I pray, were there not haile and snow, raine and dew, yce and frost, in those daies, and did not hee know that these meteors were generated of vapours, as well as you? or what should be the cause of his stupidity, and of your quicknesse of apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Alas! how doe wee please our selves in the conceits of our supposed knowledge, whereas indeed wee have but a glimmering insight in Natures works, a bare superficiall and conjecturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of naturall causes?

                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49171:8"/>5. I had said that indeed <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was not the Author of this opinion, for no ancient writer ascribes it to him; you reply, <hi>that many ancient Authors ascribe it to the Pythagorean Sect.</hi> For proofe whereof, in stead of many authors, you bring one, as if one were a multitude; and that one is <hi>Aristotle. Answ.</hi> There is a difference betweene <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and Pythagoreans; betweene the Scholar and the Master: I spake of <hi>Pythagoras; Aristotle,</hi> of the Pythagoreans. The Scholars oftentimes broach opinions which the Masters never knew; it is ordinary in all Heretickes and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to father opinions on the first founders, and on other learned men, which they never knew nor dreamed of. That impure sect of the Nicolaitans, fathered their opinions on <hi>Nicolas</hi> the Deacon. The Arians would have made the world beleeve that <hi>Origen, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Lucian</hi> the Martyr, had been the authors of their impieties. The Donatists alledge Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of their separation from the Catholick Church: and the mad-headed Circumcellions called themselves Donatists. Therefore, when you say that it appeares by <hi>Aristotles</hi> testimony, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> thought the Earth to be one of the Planets, you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for he speakes not of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> but of the Pythagoreans, of which number you are one; not onely for affirming the Earth to be a Planet, but also in holding transanimation; for you make no difference betweene <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and his disciples: thinking (as it seemes) that the soule of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> which had beene in so many bodies before, was now entred into the bodies of the Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. 2. I said that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> held, that the heavens by their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made a musicall harmonie, which could not consist with the earths motion; you say it may consist, but you doe not prove how it may; tell me, for what end doth the Heaven move? Is it not for the benefit of the Earth? But if the earth move to receive its benefit from the Heaven, surely the Heaven moveth to no end or purpose. Againe, you would faine escape by telling us, <hi>That</hi> Pythagoras <hi>meant by the musicall concent, i. the proportion and harmony that is in the bignesse and distance of the Orbes.</hi> You tell us so, but how shall we beleeve you? This saying of his is not reckoned amongst his symbolicall speeches; and if it be symbolicall, why not that saying of the Earths motion? Is not that also mysticall?</p>

So <hi>Philolaus, Nicetas Syracusanus, Ecphantus</hi> and <hi>Lysippus</hi> have little said of them: as for <hi>Heraclides Ponticus,</hi> he was a man noted more for his ambition, then for his learning; in that he affected to be a god, causing his friends to convey his dying body out of the way, and a dragon to be laid in his bed: that the world might thinke he was now a dragon; and that he should be worshipped in that forme: and indeed he shewed himselfe to be that, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be; to wit, a beast, and not a man. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="7">7. Sure, Brag is a good dog with you; for you tell us that there is scarce any of note or skill, who are not <hi>Copernicus</hi> his followers; and more there are of his opinion, then all the rest put together; and yet you tell us but of one Cardinall <hi>Cusanus,</hi> and sixe more, to avoide tediousnesse. But in this you speake by the figure Antiphrasis, by contraries: You name but one Cardinall on your side, and within three leaves after, you tell us of two Sessions of Cardinalls on our side who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49171:9"/>
condemned this opinion: are not twelve more then one? and shall not the judgement of so many be preferred to one? How many more can you picke out of the whole Colledge of Cardinalls, that were of your opinion, beside <hi>Cusanus,</hi> who was knowne to be a man that affected singularitie? But I think you looked through a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying glasse, when you concluded from the induction of five <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicits,</hi> that there were more of his opinion, then all the rest put together. Are you not like him who thought that all the ships and goods that came into the <hi>Pyreum</hi> were his owne? And yet of these five which you muster up for your defence, there was one, even the chiefest, and of longest experience, to wit, <hi>Galileus,</hi> who fell off from you; being both ashamed, and sorry that he had been so long bewitched with so ridiculous an opinion; which was proved to him both by Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and by other grave and learned men; that it was contrary both to Scripture, Divinitie, and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie: therefore <hi>Galilie</hi> on his knees did abjure, execrate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,<note place="margin">

               <p n="8">8. <hi>You advise us out of</hi> Aristotle <hi>and</hi> Ptolemy, <hi>to speake that which is most likely; to entertaine that which is most agreeable to reason; to frame such suppositions of Heaven as be most simple: and you tell us that</hi> Rheticus <hi>and</hi> Keplar <hi>wish that</hi> Aristotle <hi>were alive againe.</hi> But your advice is superfluous, and their wish is ridiculous: for we speake and intertain that which is most reasonable; if we do not, prove it, that we may amend our errour. Our suppositions of Heaven are not so simple as could be wished; but we were better content our selves with them, then move the earth with you: for that is, <hi>ex fumo in flammam,</hi> to leap out of the frying-pan into the fire. Now to wish <hi>Aristotle</hi> alive, or to thinke that he or <hi>Clavius</hi> would ever be of your opinion, are meere dreames and phancies. And though <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> had found that <hi>Ptolomies Hypotheses</hi> had not beene so exact as should be; yet he would not have beene so mad, as to beleeve the Earths motion, and the Suns rest. And though some have fallen off from <hi>Aristotles</hi> and <hi>Ptolomies</hi> opinion, to <hi>Copernicus,</hi> that will but little help your cause: for in all professions there have ever been some unconstant and giddy-headed men; many have fallen off from Christianity to Mahumetisme; from Calvinisme to Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisme; will you condemne therefore their former professions?
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49171:10"/>
so some have revolted from <hi>Copernicus</hi> to <hi>Ptolomie.</hi> You challenge then too great a priviledge, when you say that none who having bin once setled with any strong assent on your side, that have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards revolted from it: besides that it is false, there was never any profession that could brag of such a priviledge: not Christianity the best of all professions. And though some men reject that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which they were nursed, and have approved for truth, and now embrace your absurd Paradox, which is condemned in the Schooles; yet it will not follow that yours is the righter side: for will you say that because many Christians become Turks and Jews; many Orthodox men have become Arians, Nestorians, Eutychians, Macedonians; that therefore these Heretickes were in the right? There are too many wavering Spirits shaken like reeds, and carried about like clouds with every winde of doctrine, unsetled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable in all their wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You tell us, that most of those opposers of your opinion, have been stirred thereunto, either by a partiall conceit of their owne inventions, for every one is affected to his owne brood: or by a servile feare, in derogating from the ancients authoritie; or opposing of Scripture Phrases; or by judging of things by sense rather then by reason. Answ.</hi> The first of these reasons will be retorted upon your selfe; for the partiall conceit of your owne inventions, and the affection you carry to your own brood, have made you fall off from that ancient and universall truth, to embrace an errour: and this was it that moved <hi>Copernicus</hi> to oppose <hi>Ptolomie, Alphonsus,</hi> and the other famous Astronomers. Therefore, <hi>Tycho</hi> did not oppose <hi>Copernicus</hi> to make way for his owne Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis as you say, but to maintaine that truth which had so long continued in the world. As for your second reason, I answer, that we should not without extraordinary and urgent cause, derogate from the authority of the ancients; much lesse, from the meaning of Scripture phrase; which the Church of God from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hitherto hath delivered to us: neither doe we adhere to the meaning of Scripture phrase, out of a superstitious feare of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed infallible Church, as you say; but out of a filiall feare to the true Church, our Mother, the ground and pillar of truth: If wee heare not the voice of this Mother, we cannot have God for our Father. A wise son honoureth his father, but he is a foole that will despise his mother. Why should we thinke that you or <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> can better understand the Scripture phrase, then the Church of God from time to time hath done? this was the proud conceit
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49171:10"/>
of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> that he onely understood the Scripture phrase, as <hi>Vincentius</hi> complaines of him.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vincent. Lyr. adver. Hares.</hi>
                  </note> That which you call the new Creed of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, that no man should assent unto any interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione of Scripture, which is not approved by the ancient Fathers; is indeed the old Creed of the Church, as <hi>Vincentius</hi> sheweth:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vincent. ibid.</hi>
                  </note> let us no wayes no wayes (saith he) depart from that sense which our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers and predecessours have maintained. And againe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever (saith he) the Catholique Church hath of old retained, that onely shall a true Catholique maintaine and beleeve: therefore he shewes that it is the trick of Heretickes to delight in novelties; and to reject and despise old doctrines. <hi>Us profanis novitat bus gaudeant, antiquitatis scit a fastidiant.</hi> If then the Jesuites, in reverence to the Churches authority, and to the ancient Fathers doe oppose this opinion they deserve commendation: and so did these Cardinals that called it in, and punished the defenders of it. Thirdly, you say that we judge of things by sense, rather then by reason; but indeed you have no reason to say so: for although that sensitive things, such as the Earths stability, and Sunnes motion, are to be judged by sense;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cont. Lans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergum.</hi>
                  </note> yet we have many reasons for us, whereby we judge it must be so as I have shewed heretofore. But I confesse we judge not by your reasons, because they are but shadowes of reason, and no way satisfactory: neither doe we so tie the meaning of Scripture to the letter of it (as you say,) but that we give freedome to raise o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther senses, whether allegoricall, tropologicall, or anagogicall; so they be not repugnant to faith and good manners. But in histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call things, Saint <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, that we must chiefly adhere to the literall sense;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 8. <hi>De Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. ad lit. c.</hi> 1 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2.</note> and it is a Maxime in the Schooles, that we must not reject the literall sense, which is not contrary, <hi>agendis aut credendis,</hi> to the Creed or the Law: neither is it unlawfull to conclude Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophicall points from the letter of Gods word, seeing there is but one truth in Divinitie and Philosophie. But to conclude Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall points flat contrary to the letter of divine Scripture, as you doe, is too much boldnesse: therefore, I will speake to you in the words of Saint <hi>Austin,</hi>

And likewise, your instancing of <hi>Shonbergius,</hi> who importunately begged the Commentaries of <hi>Copernicus</hi>: was is not rather out of curiosity to see how he could defend such an absurd Paradox, then out of true affection to embrace it? So <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> desired to see Christ; I doubt not but many will desire to see your booke of this subject, which (I dare presume) will never be of

your opinion. Lastly, where as you say, <hi>It is absurd not to assent to any thing in naturall questions, but what authority shall allow of.</hi> I say, it were both absurd and dangerous for mens soules, and the peace of the Church, if men were suffered to assent to any absurditie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Scripture, sense, reason, and the Churches authority.</p>

                  <hi>IT were happy for us</hi> (say you) <hi>if we could exempt Scripture from Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophicall controversies.</hi> And I say, It were happy for us, if all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophicall controversies could be decided by Scripture; or if men would be so modest, as to rest contented with Scripture phrases, and expressions of such Philosophicall points, as are mentioned there: But what hope is there to end controversies, when many are so wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their own phansies, that neither will they yeeld to Scripture, except they may have leave to interpret them; nor to reasons, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they may have leave to forme them; nor will they trust their own senses, but will captivate and enslave them also to their ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse imaginations? The Scripture tells us in plaine tearmes, the Earth is immoveable: our senses doe assure us, and many reasons which I have heretofore alledged, induce us to beleeve the truth of this assertion: and yet you spurning at Scripture, sense, and reason, as if your phansie were <hi>instar omnium,</hi> would have our judgements, senses, Scripture, Church, and all regulated by your absurd dictates; therefore it is an unreasonable thing in you, to desire that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost should not be Judge of his owne assertions in naturall truths; and that there should be more credit given to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, (which you call industry and experience) then to Gods own words. Indeed this travell hath God left to the sonnes of men, to be exercised with, as a punishment for their sins; to toile and labour all their dayes about shadowes, imaginations, and indeed meer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; groping at the doore of knowledge (like blinde Sodomites)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49171:12"/>
all their dayes, and cannot finde it; so that they who have spent their whole life in Astronomie, may with Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> say on their death bed; <hi>Master We have laboured all night, but have caught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Thus with <hi>Martha,</hi> they are busie about many things, and neglect that one thing which is onely necessary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is but a conceit of yours to say, <hi>That the Scripture accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates it selfe to the vulgars conceit, in saying, the Sunne riseth and falleth, &amp;c.</hi> I warrant you, if the vulgar should conceive that the heavens were made of water, as the <hi>Gnostickes</hi> held; or that the Sunne and Moone were two ships, with the <hi>Manichees</hi>; or that the world was made of the sweat of the <hi>AEones,</hi> with the <hi>Valentinians</hi>: or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever other absurd opinion they should hold, you would make the Scripture say so, and to accommodate it selfe to their conceits. The stability of the Earth, and motion of the Heaven, are absurd and false opinions in your conceit; and yet the Scripture affirmes them. You are as unapt I know to beleeve that the Sunne moves, as others are that it stands still; therefore it's a wonder you do not begin to call the Scripture authority in question, that affirmes the Suns motion: seeing you say men would be apt to doe so, if the Scripture had said, the Sunne standeth, &amp;c. How shall the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture please both parties? if it say the Sun moveth, your side will except against it: if it say the Sun standeth, ours will be offended at it. Why should the Scripture be more loath to offend us then you, except it be because we are the stronger side; and we have our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to witnesse with us, which you have not? I wish you would conceive a more reverend opinion of the Spirit of truth, who cannot lie; nor will affirme a falshood upon any pretence whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; neither will he countenance a lie, to confirme a truth; or speake false in one thing, that wee may conceive his meaning the better in another thing. He needs not such weake and wicked helps as falshoods, to make us understand his will; his word is strong and mighty in operation; it's the power of God unto salvation; a sharp two edged sword; his hammer, his scepter, &amp;c. As it stands not with his truth to affirme a lie, so doth it no wayes consist with the power of his Word and Spirit, to helpe our understanding by a lie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You say, <hi>That if the Scripture had said, the Earth riseth and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and the Sunne stands still; the people being unacquainted with that secret, would not have understood the meaning of it. Answ.</hi> What matter is it whether they had understood it or not? For you tell
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49171:12"/>
us that these things are not necessary in themselves; and that it is besides the scope of these places, to instruct us in Philosophicall points. Will you have the holy Ghost then speake a falshood? for feare lest we should not understand the meaning of a secret, which is not necessary for us to know: if it be not needfull for us to know whether the Earth stands or not; so it was lesse needfull for the Scripture to say the Earth standeth, when it doth not stand. But you doe well to call the motion of the Earth a secret, for so it is a great secret, hid from the wise and prudent of this world, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed onely to such babes as your selfe. But why is this a secret? If it be a naturall effect, it is no secret; for though naturall causes doe not incurre into our senses, yet the effects doe; and if this be a secret effect and not sensible, it cannot be an effect of nature; but I thinke it be such another secret as the Philosophers stone, which never was, and never shall be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though it be beside the chiefe scope of Scripture to instruct us in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophicall points:</hi> yet it will not follow, that these Philosophicall tearmes are to be otherwise understood, then as they are expressed. There be many Geographicall, Historicall, and Chronologicall pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in Scripture, mentioned incidently, and not chiefly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct us in such points: shall we therefore understand them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then they are set downe, or rather the cleane contrary way? But when you say the Earths motion is beyond our reach; I grant it: because we cannot reach that which is not made manifest to us, either by sense or reason, or divine authority; If you can either of these wayes make it appeare, I doubt not but our understanding will reach it: and if you cannot one of these wayes make it appear to us, we will account it a meere nothing. For <hi>idem est non esse, &amp; non videri:</hi> and indeed you say well out of the Glosse, that God doth not teach curiosities which are not apprehended easily; for your motion of the Earth is an incomprehensible curiosity. And it is well said by you againe, that the Scriptures authority might be questioned, if it did teach naturall things contrary to our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and therefore if any booke of Scripture should affirme, as you doe; that the earth moves naturally and circularly, I should verily beleeve that that booke had never been indicted by the holy Spirit, but rather by a Pythagorean spirit, or by the spirit of Dutch beer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You condemne</hi> Tertullians <hi>Heretickes for retching Scripture a wrong way, and forcing it to some other sense agreeable to their false imagination; and rather then they would forgoe their tenents, yeelded the Scripture to be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49171:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
erroneous. De te fabula narretur.</hi> You retch the Scripture a wrong way, forcing it to your false imaginations; you do not indeed call the Scripture erroneous, but you make it to speake one thing, and meane the cleane contrary; therefore, you shall doe well to apply Saint <hi>Austins</hi> counsell to your selfe, and doe not settle your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rashly on that darke and obscure conceit of the Earths motion. It is true also what you alledge out of Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> that the holy Ghost being to deliver more necessary truths,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Gen. ad Fteram.</hi>
                  </note> left out to speake of the forme or figure of Heaven, &amp;c. because hee would not have us spend too much time in these things, and neglect the meanes of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but you should have done well to have subjoined the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words of that same Father, to wit; <hi>That is true which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by divine authority, rather then that which is guessed at by humane infirmity.</hi> For there he speakes of Philosophicall points, which seeme to be contrary to Scripture: but you are mistaken when you say, <hi>that God descends to our capacity in naturall things; and conformes his expressions to the mistake of our judgements, as he doth apply himselfe to our apprehensions, by being represented like a man.</hi> There is infinite oddes betweene God and naturall things; wee that are corporall cannot understand spirituall things, much lesse that infinite Spirit, but by familiar expressions; yet such as doe in some sort represent his attributes to us: as he is said to have eyes, hands, &amp;c. by which are signified his knowledge, operations, &amp;c. But for naturall things there was no such necessity, because naturall men, by natures light are able to understand naturall things: so wee know what a circular motion is; and if the Earth did truely move, we should as soon apprehend the motion of it, as we do the Suns motion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there was no need why God should descend to our capacity in affirming an untruth, because wee cannot understand the Earths motion. God then doth not conforme his expressions to the errour of our judgements; for our judgements doe not erre in this; but he speakes according to the truth of the thing, which wee judge and apprehend as it is. We apprehend the fire to be hot; if you were of an opinion that it were cold, (which you may as well maintaine as the Earths motion) you would doubtlesse tell us, that the Scripture in saying the fire is hot, applies it selfe to the vulgar er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or mistake of our judgements; thus you may make the Scripture to serve you for defence of any absurdity, by using such a subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and running into such a starting hole.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>You examine those particular Scriptures which are urged to prove
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49171:13"/>
the Suns motion, and you tell us that they are spoken in reference to the appearance of things, and the false opinions of the vulgar; and in the</hi> 75. pag. <hi>of your Booke, you say it is a frequent custome for the holy Ghost to speake of naturall things, rather according to appearance and common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, then the truth it selfe.</hi> I would 1. know if this consequence be Logicke; the holy Ghost speakes of naturall things according to appearance, frequently, and of some, <hi>ergo</hi> continually, and of all; or particularly of this; to wit, the Earths immobility. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture oftentimes speakes of God according to mens opinion and capacity; as, that he is angry, that he repents, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture speaks still of God thus: and so, when the Scripture sayes, that God is a Spirit, or just, or infinite, or eternall; that may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood (if your Logicke be good) according to opinion or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; this will prove a dangerous kind of reasoning. 2. Why doth not the holy Ghost tell us in plaine tearmes, that the Earth moves, if it doth move? what end hath hee to tell us that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable? Is it because we are not capable to understand such a high mysterie? that is ridiculous. For is it a greater mysterie then Christs Incarnation, Resurrection, Ascension, &amp;c. which are set downe in plaine tearms? but indeed it is no mysterie; it's easie to understand the Earths motion, if it did move. Or is it because the holy Ghost would not give offence to the world, in telling them plainly that the Earth moved, being an opinion so repugnant to sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? Then doubtlesse he would not have told us, that the Sun and Moone stood still at <hi>Ioshua's</hi> command; or that the Sea was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Moses</hi> Rod; and those other miracles of holy Writ, as much repugnant to sense and naturall reason, as the Earths motion is: the holy Ghost useth not to hide or mince the truth, for feare of offending men. 3. There is great oddes betweene asseverations and allusions; betweene the affirmation of a truth, and an allusion to a fiction The Scripture speaking of perverse men that will not heare Gods word, alludes to the fiction (as you call it,) of the adder stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his eare; <hi>ergo,</hi> when the Scripture speakes of the Earths im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobility, it speaks according to common opinion. A goodly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence; as if you would say, the Scripture speakes figuratively of Christ, when it calls him a Lamb, a Doore, a Vine: <hi>ergo,</hi> when the Scripture speakes of the beheading of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> it speakes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to common opinion: if there be no better Logicke taught in the Universities of the Moone, we will never send our Sons thither. 3. It is a rule in Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> that we should expound Scripture as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49171:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Saints have expounded it before us;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De verbis Domini, Ser.</hi> 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Quomodo bac verba intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexerunt Sancti, sic utique intelligenda sunt</hi>: But name me that Saint that ever expounded these Scriptures, which speake of the Heavens motion and of the Earths immobilitie, according to appearance and common opinion. Of St. <hi>Austins</hi> minde was the sixth generall Councell, prohibiting any man to interpret Scripture, otherwise then the Lights and Doctors of the Church, have hitherto expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them by their writings; which Canon is confirmed in the eleventh Session of the third Lateran Councell. 5. The ancient Fathers warne us, that we doe not deviate or depart from the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sense of Scripture, so long as no absurdity doth follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: now, no absurdity doth follow upon the literall sense of the Earths immobilitie; but upon your sense and exposition many absurdities follow; therefore we must not depart from the literall sense. 6. Where the holy Ghost speakes obscurely and figuratively in one place, hee doth in another place open himselfe in plaine tearmes, as Saint<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Isai.c.</hi> 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Hierome</hi> observes: but speaking of the Earths im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobilitie, he useth still the same phrases; neither doth he explaine himselfe otherwise in any one place; which doubtlesse hee would have done, if he had meant otherwise then hee spoake. 7. I abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny that the holy Ghost speakes of naturall things, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then in truth and reality; and not (as you say,) according to common opinions. As for your expositions of these Scriptures which are for us, and your instances against our opinion; they are wrested, and false, and impertinent, and of no soliditie, as we will shew by our answer or reply to each of them severally.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is usuall with you to cut your throate with your owne sword, and to bring passages against your selfe; for you would prove that the Scripture speakes of the Heavens motion, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence onely to the Vulgars false opinion; because,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The Sunne is in his glory like a Bridegroome; and in his motion like a Gyant.</hi> I answer, if the Sunne be in his motion like a Gyant, then sure the Sunne hath motion; for how can that which is not, be compared to that which is? Similitudes cannot illustrate non entities. 2. If the Sun were not a glorious creature, <hi>David</hi> had not compared his glory to without motion, he had not compared his motion, to the motion of a Gyant: if there be no motion in the winde and thunder, it had been idle to give wings to the one, or arrowes to the other, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> doth. 3.

falshood in positive tearmes, but also bring similitudes to illustrate it? this is to make the holy Ghost a cherither, fomenter, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of untruths; for so it must be, if the Sunne move not, the Scripture shewing it doth move, and declaring by similies how it doth move. 4. What consequence is this? The Scripture compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Sun to a Bridegroome, and a Gyant; <hi>ergo,</hi> the Scripture speaking of the Suns motion, speakes in reference to the false opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Vulgar? it is all one with this: The Gospel compares Christ to a Bridegroome; <hi>ergo,</hi> the Gospel speaking of Christs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, speakes in reference to the false opinion of the Vulgar. 5. There is ods between positive speeches and comparisons; the Sun is never called a Bridegroome in Scripture, but is said to be like a Bridegroome: <hi>Simile non est idem.</hi> But in Scripture still, the Sun is said to move, and the earth to be stable, in positive tearmes. 6. That <hi>David</hi> in this comparison did allude to the phansie of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people, supposing the Sun by night to rest in a chamber, is but your groundlesse conceit: you might say rather that he alluded to the fiction of Poets, describing <hi>Aurora</hi> to go to bed every night with <hi>Tythonus; Tythous croceum <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But neither to this pleasant bed, nor to that of <hi>Tythonus,</hi> nor to the Vulgar conceit doth <hi>David</hi> allude; but simply sets out Gods Majesty in the glory of the Sunne, by a familiar example, taken from the glory of a Bridegroome coming out of his chamber. 7. This former part of the Psalme is interpreted by the Fathers mystically of Christ, whose motion and alacrity to run his race from the wombe to the grave, from heaven to earth, and from earth to heaven; I hope you will not say, are to be understood in reference to the false opinion of the Vulgar. 8. He is not compared to a Gyant, in respect of his big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the morning, (as you say) no more then he is to a dwarfe, in respect of his littlenesse at noone; but in respect of the indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable swiftnesse of his motion, he is compared to a mighty runner: for there is no mention made of a Gyant in the Hebrew text, neither was it fit to compare him to a Gyant. 9. Nor doth <hi>David</hi> allude to the Vulgar opinion, when he speakes of the ends of Heaven; for in a round globe or circle there are no ends: but he speaks with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Hemisphere, which you must needs yeeld hath ends; for it terminates and ends in the Horizon, called therefore Finitor. Besides, in the Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine texts, it is not said, the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49171:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ends; but the remotest parts of Heaven: and so you cannot deny but some parts are remoter from us then other parts. 10. Neither hath the Scripture any reference to the common mistake, as if the Sun were actually hot, when it saith, (<hi>nothing is hid from the heate thereof:</hi>) these Philosophers who deny any actuall heat in the Sun, yet say the Sun is hot: and I doubt not but you have said so many a time, and yet you have no reference to any actuall heate in the Sun. Do not you use to call cinnamon-water, and such like distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led waters, hot waters? and yet they are actually cold. Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers tell us that <hi>Saturne</hi> is cold, and yet they doe not thinke that he is the subject of cold, but the cause onely. The Scripture saith, <hi>That none can avoid the anger of God</hi>; and yet you will not say that this passion is in God. The Sunne then is hot, not by any heate in him, but by calefaction from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Scripture saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>The Sunne riseth and goeth downe</hi>; this is not spoken in relation to the circumference which is equally distant from the Center; but in reference to the Horizon as you confesse, or rather to the scituation of Judea; and so of other Countreys: and in this respect, the Sunne doth not onely seeme, but doth in very deed rise and fall to the Inhabitants. For doth not the Sunne truely ascend when he comes to your meridian, and truely descend, when he removes from it? Doth he not truly ascend and descend, to those who have him for their Zenith in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian? Astronomers tell us that there is a true and reall rising and falling of the Starres, as well as an apparent; and then are they not truely said to rise and fall, when they doe truely ascend above, and descend beneath the Horizon? If the Sunne doth not truely ascend and descend, then the shadowes doe not truly increase and decrease; and so our Sun-dialls doe not truely shew us the hours of the day, but in shew onely, and in appearance; but wee see that the shadow still decreaseth, as the luminous body ascendeth, and encreaseth as that descendeth. <hi>Virgils Tytirus</hi> can tell you so much:

                  <hi>Joshua</hi> saith, <hi>That the Sunne stood still in the midst of heaven: Now, Heaven</hi> (you say) <hi>hath no midst but the Center, and so this is also spoken in reference to the Vulgar opinion. Answ.</hi> By the Center, either you must understand the Earth, or the Sunne; the Earth indeed is in the midst of the world, but not in the midst of Heaven; for it is not there at all: if it were, Christ needed not to ascend to Heaven,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49171:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being in the midst of it, when he was on the earth. Wicked men then would have the best of it; for as they have the largest posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions on earth, so should they have the largest shares in heaven. If by the Center you meane the Sunne, then you speake in reference to the Vulgar opinion; for the Center is in the midst of Heaven, the Sunne is the Center; therefore the Sun is in the midst of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and so <hi>Joshua</hi> saith. 2. By the Heaven he doth not understand the whole celestiall Globe, but the Hemisphere; and so this having its Horizon or outmost limits and extreames, must also have its middle: and what can that else be, but the Meridian passing through the Zenith? Thus then it is demonstrable that whatsoever is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distant from the extreames is in the midsts; but the Sun being in the Zenith or Meridian, is equally distant from the extreames: therefore the Sun being in the Zenith, is in the midst of Heaven. 3. The Hebrew Doctors tell us, that when the Sun stood still, hee was then in the Summers solstice, being the Tropicke of <hi>Cancer</hi>; from which Judea is not farre distant: and so in that regard also <hi>Joshua</hi> might truly say, that the Sunne was in the midst of Heaven, being then over their heads. 4. If it be a vulgar opinion to say, that the Sunne is in the midst of Heaven; then all the chiefe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both in Divinitie, Philosophie, and Poetrie, speake as the Vulgar doe; for they use the same phrase: hence came the word Meridian, <hi>Meridies,</hi> Mid-day, Mid-night. If the Sunne were not every day in the midst of Heaven; how should the Artificiall day be divided into equall parts? Therefore <hi>Clavins</hi> tells us, that the Meridian is called by Astronomers,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>It is ridiculous to think with you, that the Sun was over</hi> Gibeon <hi>only in appearance and vulgar conceit:</hi> For indeed the Sun was truly over <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon,</hi> although he was no more over that then over other places. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you were in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, and divers others were there too;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49171:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is the roofe of that Church over your head only in appearance and vulgar conceit, because it is over other heads as well as yours; or because it is much larger then your head? Or must that phrase be thought improper, the roofe is over your head? 2. The figure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsis is frequent in Scripture, when there some words wanting in a phrase which are to be supplied: as, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Vzza put forth to the Arke,</hi> is understood, <hi>his hand.</hi> So 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>I with Scorpions,</hi> is understood, <hi>will chastise you.</hi> So here, <hi>Sun stand still in Gibeon,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, <hi>while we are fighting</hi>? and so the words must be rendered: Stand still whilest we are fighting in <hi>Gibeon</hi>; for not onely the city, but its territories where <hi>Ioshua's</hi> army was, are called by the same name. So, <hi>Moon in the valley of Ajalon,</hi> is understood, <hi>goe not downe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These words, (<hi>There was no day like that before it, or after it</hi>) you say, <hi>are not to be understood absolutely, but in respect of the vulgar opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; because there be longer dayes under the Pole. Answ. Ioshua</hi> spoke not this with any reference to vulgar opinions, but to the Climate in which he lived, and where the miracle was shewed; it was the longest day that ever was in those parts; and what reason had he to except the dayes under the Poles, being nothing to his purpose? When Christ saith, <hi>There be twelve houres in the day,</hi> his words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood absolutely; for there be more houres where the Horizon hath any obliquity; and the higher the Pole is elevated above the Horizon, the more houres have the dayes in Summer; yet his words are true, <hi>in sphera recta,</hi> and in those Countreys that are under and neere the Line. And what will you conclude from this? that because these and such like phrases, are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood absolutely; therefore this phrase (the Sun moves,) is not to be understood absolutely? But I will reply. These phrases are true in respect of the Climate they were spoken of; <hi>ergo</hi> this phrase al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, (the Sun moves) is true, in regard of the Climate it is spoken of. If then Judea be the place where the Earth is stable, and the Sun moves, your opinion is quite overthrown by the force of your own instance: for if the Earth be immoveable in any Climate, and the Sun moveable, we have that which we desire: it lieth on you to shew how, and why the Sun should move there, and not elsewhere; why and how the earth moves here and not there. 2. These words of <hi>Ioshua's,</hi> perhaps have no reference to the length of the day, although the vulgar Translation read it so; but rather to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the miracle, the Heavens hearkening to the voyce of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man. <hi>Ioshua</hi> acknowledgeth, <hi>That never any such day was before

His Argument had bin of no force, had not the Sun moved at all, as you think. 3. If the shadow moved onely without the Sun, then either that shadow moved it self, which is ridiculous to think; or it was moved by the motion of the dyall, or of the gnomon and index of the dyall: Now, if the dyall or gnomon was moved by God or an Angel, tell us where you read it. Why might it not as well be turned about with a mans hand, or by some engine, and so this would have bin a suspected miracle; or else the shadow returned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the motion of some other luminous body, &amp; so this were to multiply miracles needlesly; for 1. that light must be created for that purpose. 2. It must have a particular motion of its own. 3. It must be a greater light then that of the Sunne, otherwise the shadow had not beene discernible. 4. It must either be united to some other light, or else vanish; all which was needlesse: is it not safer then to adhere to Gods word? from which when we wander, we fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many by-wayes.

You say, <hi>There would have been some intimation of the extraordinary length of the day, as it is in that of Ioshua:</hi> I answer, there was no such reason, why the length of this day should be mentioned; because this day was much shorter then <hi>Ioshua's,</hi> in respect it fell out in

                  <hi>Ioshua</hi> was in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer solstice, as the Hebrew Doctors observe. 3. Had the Sunne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, <hi>This had been</hi> (you say) <hi>a greater miracle then those which were done on more solemne occasions. Answ.</hi> God regards not the solemnity of occasions, in shewing of his miracles; if he had, Christ had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wrought his miracles in obscure and remote places, as hills and deserts: He would rather have shewed his transfiguration in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, to all the world, then upon Mount Tabor, onely to three Disciples. He useth his miracles, as he did the loaves; he bestowed seaven loaves on foure thousand men, and but five loaves upon five thousand: on small occasions God sometimes produceth great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and upon great occasions sometimes hee sheweth none. 2. We must looke rather to the fitnesse of the miracle, then to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the occasion: the Sunne represented the King, who was the life and glory of his kingdome. God would let him and all men see, that as he onely hath power to rule, and alter the course of the Sunne; so it is he onely, that rules and turnes the hearts of Kings: the Sunne was obedient to Gods command, so should the King be. As the Sun moves to and fro, so doth the shadow; and as the King is affected, so is the people. The going down of the Sunne brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth sadnesse on the earth, so doth the death of a King. 3. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of this miracle was not so small as you take it; the sicknesse, prayers and teares of a good King; the prayers of a great Prophet, the affection that God would shew his people, in delivering them from the hand of Assyria; and the love that hee carried to such a King, that rather then his faith shall faile, the Sunne shall change his course; and the lesson that he would teach us, that wee should honour Kings, whom God doth so much honour; as to make the King of Planets stand still at the request of one, to goe backe at the petition of another: these I say were the occasions of this miracle. 4. The going backe of the Sunne is not a greater miracle (as you say) then his standing still; for the standing of the Red-sea, was as great a miracle, as the going backe of Jordan. 5. The shadow in the historie of the Kings is onely mentioned, because the shadowes moving was more visible then the Suns. 6. <hi>This signe</hi> (you say) <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not in the Sunne, because the wonder was done in the land. Answ.</hi> The signe was in the Sunne, and that the Babylonians saw; they sent to know the wonder, that is, what strange effect it had done in the land of Judea. There be oftentimes strange Prodigies in the Aire, which cause strange effects on the Earth. If I should send to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49171:17"/>
Italie or Germanie, to know of some strange Prodigies seene there in the Aire; and if I should enquire what wonder or effect these had wrought in the land, or in these countreys; would you conclude that there was no prodigious signe at all in the Aire? The Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men saw a new Starre, which shewed to them the miraculous birth of a new King; because they came to Judea, to see the wonder done in the land: you will therehence conclude, that there was no signe at all in the Heaven, neither Starre, nor motion of a Starre. 7. <hi>You doubt of the truth of the Sunnes going backe, because no mention of it in ancient Writers:</hi> But if you will doubt or deny all passages and miracles of Scripture, which are not mentioned by the Heathen writers, our Bible will be reduced to a small handfull: they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not the standing of the Sunne, will you deny that too? But you reply, <hi>That they had some light of it, by alluding to it in the Fable of Phaeton, when the Sun was so irregular in his course, that he burned some part of the world:</hi> but indeed, this seems rather to allude to the Suns going backe, then to his standing; for an irregular course is more like a retrograde motion, then a standing still. But it is most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that this Fable alludes to the conflagration of Sodome, and the other cities of the plaine:<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 32. 31</note> but however the Gentiles were not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this miracle, as may be seen by that message sent to <hi>Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> by the Babylonians, who were then the onely Astronomers. And Saint <hi>Austin</hi> proves, that this miracle was knowne to the Heathen, by that Verse in <hi>Virgil:</hi>
                  <q>Sistere aquam fluviis, &amp; vertere sidera retro:</q>

But <hi>Ioseph's</hi> in his first booke against <hi>Apion,</hi> will tell you the reasons, why the Gentile writers made little mention of the Jewish affairs and miracles; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of ignorance; as knowing little or nothing of the Jewes; because they were not a people given to travell, or merchandising, and dwelt not in maritime towns: and partly out of malice to that Nation, they concealed Gods love to them, and the wonders done amongst them; and indeed most of the ancient Records by injury of time, fury of fire and waters, and neglect of those that should have kept them are lost; both amongst the Gentiles and the Jewes, as those Bookes of the Kings of Judah and Israel, which are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly named in Scripture.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49171:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Sunne, (which he calls the rising of the Sun in the West;) because he exceeds in the computation of years: but by this means you will wrong all Historians, if you question the substance of the story for an errour in the circumstance: an errour in the computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time takes not away the truth of the thing it selfe. The <hi>China</hi> people reck on an incredible number of yeares from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world; yet you will not deny but that they had some knowledge of the Creation, and that their relation of it is true. The Chaldeans and Egyptians reckon 432. thousand yeares before the Floud; will you therefore say, they had no knowledge of the Floud? The Septuagints reckon from <hi>Adam</hi> to the Floud, 2262. yeares; whereas the Hebrews number onely 1656. yeares; and yet the Fathers reject not the Septuagints testimony concerning the Floud; but most of them also follow their supputation. And how doe you know but that <hi>Herodotus</hi> number of yeares may agree well enough with ours; seeing divers Countreys did reckon their years diversly. The Arcadian year consisted but of three moneths; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnanian of sixe: the Roman at first but of tenne. The Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an year was various; for sometime it consisted of thirteen months, sometime but of foure, and sometime of three onely, and of two, and of one onely sometime. Therefore doubtlesse <hi>Herodotus</hi> years were either Arcadian, or Egyptian; and so compare them with our yeares, you will finde that there is no such oddes as you make: and that in speaking of the Sunnes retrogradation, he hath not refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the times that never were. And whereas you say that this miracle hapned when <hi>Hesiod</hi> flourished, you faile in your Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie; for <hi>Hesiod</hi> was above a hundred yeares before this miracle was effected, if you will beleeve <hi>Gentbrard</hi> and the other Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers.<note place="margin">

               <p>IN this Proposition you goe about to shew us, <hi>That the Scripture in naturall things conformes it selfe to our conceived errours, and that it speakes of things not as they are in themselves, but as they appeare.</hi> And yet the testimony of <hi>Vallesius</hi> which you bring to help you, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes you; for,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Whatsoever</hi> (saith hee) <hi>is in Scripture concerning Nature, is most true, as proceeding from the God of Nature, from whom nothing could be hid.</hi> If the Scripture expressions of naturall things be most true, then they cannot agree with our erroneous conceits; for truth and errour agree like light and darknesse: and you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse your selfe that all naturall points in Scripture are certain and infallible; but in that sense (say you) wherein they were first inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that is the sense that you give; for you only are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the first intended sense of the holy Ghost, and so wee must take it upon your bare word that that onely is the true sense which your side delivereth: and I pray you what heresie may not be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Scripture this way? for heretickes will also say, That all things in Scripture are true, certaine, and evident, in that sense which was at first intended; but when it comes to the point, it is the sense which they themselves have invented obtruded.</p>
               <p>The first instance which you bring for proof of your assertion, is from the Moon, which is called in Scripture, <hi>One of the great lights; and yet by infallible observation</hi> (say you) <hi>may be proved to be lesse then any visible starre. Answ.</hi> Other Astronomers will prove as strongly as you can, that <hi>Mercury</hi> is the least of all starres; shall wee beleeve you, or them? 2. Though I should yeeld that the Moon were a small starre in bulk, will it follow that therefore it is a lesser light? Must the light be intended, as the body is extended? I have seen a fire yeeld lesse light then a candle; <hi>Mercury,</hi> which you say is bigger then the Moon, hath not the hundreth part of that light which is in the Moon: so that if <hi>Mercury</hi> and the Moon should change places, yet the light of the Moon would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49171:19"/>
much lesser, nor the light of <hi>Mercury</hi> much bigger: the eie which is the light of the body, is not the clearer because the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; there is not so much light in an Oxe eie, as in an Eagle's: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines hold, That the light which was created the first day, was no other then the light of the Sun diffused over the hemispheare; the whole hemispheare is much bigger, I hope, then the body of the Sun; and yet the world, I think, was not more enlightened the first day, then the fourth, when that diffused light was contracted and compacted in a narrower compasse. 3. To what end should there be so much light in each starre exceeding the light of the Moone? They received their light not for themselves, but for us; (except you will say there be innumerable worlds, which must be enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned aswell as ours) but wee receive by many degrees more light from one halfe of the Moon, then wee doe from all the starres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Surely God made nothing in vaine; but in vain hath the starres so much light, if man, for whom they were made, receive no sight nor benefit from this light. 4. Astronomicall positions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the magnitude and heighth of each starre, on which they ground their darke conjecture of light, are toyes and fictions of their owne heads: they make false Maximes, and on these they build confused Babels of their owne conceits: yeeld to them that they have the semidiameter of the earth, and then

Let them give us leave to trust our owne eyes; it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that they give more light to the earth then all the rest do, &amp;c. The Scripture then, and our owne senses assure us that these are the great lights. If you say that each starre is a bigger light in it selfe then the Moon, I will beleeve it when I see it; or have talked with one of your world in the Moon, who perhaps can informe us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then any reason you can bring to evince us.</p>

If this consequence be good, then it will follow, that you never speake exactly of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophicall points: for you sometimes in mentioning of numbers, omit the lesser number; as when you say seaventy Interpreters, whereas there were seaventy two. Lastly, I answer, that there is great oddes betweene an historicall narration of the measure of a vessell, as it was taken by the work-men, who are not still exact Geometricians: and a plaine and constant affirmation of a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophicall truth. He that wrote the Bookes of the <hi>Kings,</hi> sets down the circumference of the brasen sea to be thirty cubites, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter to bee ten; for so doubtlesse the measure was taken by the work-men: but when the Scripture saith, <hi>The earth is immoveable</hi>; it records this as a Philosophicall or Theological maxime; and not as an historicall passage.

For the left side is more imperfect and weak then the right, which cannot be said of heaven, being an uniforme, and every way perfect body. And how can there be a right and left side, where there is neither sense nor life, nor distinction of organicall parts? Therefore, in trees and plants, there is no right or left side, though they have life; much lesse can this be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in heaven. 2.

The word (<hi>heart</hi>) here may signifie the soule or minde; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as it doth often in Scripture, and in humane writings too; the soule is called heart, and the heart is called soule oftentimes.

                  <hi>Peter, By the hidden man of the heart,</hi> is meant, the renovation of the minde. If then by the heart is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the mind or soule, you must needs grant, that it is a tenent no lesse true then common, that the understanding is in the heart, whether you take it for a part, or for a power, or for a facultie of the soule. 3.

to be in the heart; but some in the head, some in the breast, some in all the body. <hi>Herodotus</hi> affirmed it to be in the ears; <hi>Blemor</hi> in the eyes; <hi>Strato</hi> in the eye-browes: onely the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes and Stoicks, placed it in the heart. 4. The holy Ghost at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes understanding to the heart; not because it was a common, but because a true tenent: for howsoever <hi>Galen</hi> and his Sectaries hold the contrary, yet it is certaine, that the heart is the true seat of the understanding. For 1. The will is in the heart, therefore the understanding is there also; such is the dependency of these two faculties, the one from the other, that the will is never without the understanding; and indeed these two are but one in essence; for the will is nothing else, but the understanding dilated, extended, inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the desire and fruition of that object which it apprehends. 2. The Apostle saith, <hi>That we beleeve with the heart,</hi> (except you will have this also to be spoken according to opinion, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth) but without understanding, we cannot beleeve;<note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>Mens,</hi> minde or understanding is in the left ventricle of the heart. That Booke, <hi>De morbo sacro,</hi> which goeth under the name of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth this truth, is justly affirmed by <hi>Galen</hi> to be none of his. 8. Though I should yeeld to the <hi>Galenists,</hi> that the understanding is in the braine; yet I will yeeld that it is there onely instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and secondarily, and in respect of its act or exercise; for ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, principally, and in respect of its faculty, it is in the heart onely: neither would there be any exercise of understanding in the braine, if it were not from the influence which it receiveth from the heart. Neither is this strange, that the act should be in one part,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49171:22"/>
and the faculty in another; for the faculty of seeing is in the brain, and yet the act of seeing is in the eye: so that though the eye were lost, yet the faculty would remaine still in the braine. As for any thing that the <hi>Galenists</hi> can say against this, it is of no moment; for although the braine be hurt, wounded, or inflamed, yet the faculty of understanding is not lost, though the act or exercise be hindered. Besides, there is a phrensie or alienation of the minde, upon a hurt or inflamation of the Diaphragma, as well as of the braine; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ancient Physicians called this muscule, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt, the minde was hurt: the remedies applied to the head by which the braine is cured, doe not argue that the understanding is there; but that there it doth exercise it selfe: and yet remedies are applied sometimes to those parts where the disease is not, but in some other place; but this I leave to Physicians. I remember that <hi>Philo</hi> will have the understanding which he compares to a King, to be in the head; because there be all the senses, as the Kings guard: but he is deceived, for the guard may be in the same house with the King, but not in his bed-chamber. The guard or outward senses are in the outward court, the inward senses are in the privy cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but the King himselfe is in the heart, as in his bed-chamber. If any reply that the head is uppermost, and therefore the worthiest part of the body, and fittest for the King to be there; I answer no; for the garret or upper part of the house is for the servants to lodge in; the King ought to be in the most inward and safest part of his palace. It is evident then by what we have said, that the holy Ghost by placing the understanding in the heart, did speake according to truth, and not to common opinion; and therefore to write that the spirit of truth who leadeth us into all truth, speaketh rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to opinion then truth; is a note blacker then your inke, unfit to fall from the pen of a Christian. For even allegories, tropes, figures and parables, are truths: but I impute this slip rather to negligence in you, then malice.</p>

It was a viper, not an aspe, that leaped upon Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> hand: they were aspes, not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> applied to her breasts. 3. <hi>This Scripture doth not allude to that common fabulous story of the viper, as you say, breaking his passage through the females bowels:</hi> but it compares the counsels and plots of wicked men to the egs of the aspes, which being white and faire to the eye, are venomous within, and cannot be broken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the indangering and poysoning of him that breakes them: so wicked mens smooth counsels and plots, howsoever specious in their pretences, are notwithstanding venemous and deadly in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> intentions and execution. 4. Though I should grant you that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers have egges, yet it is one thing for men to breake vipers egges, and another thing for young vipers to breake through the bowels of the female; the Scripture speaketh of the former breaking, and not of the latter; neither hath it any relation at all in this place to that story of the vipers breaking through the belly of the female.</p>

To inferre that no vipers are killed by their young ones, because some are not, is as much as if you would say, no women are sicke or pained in their childe-birth, because some are not. Thus you see that you can make no treakle or antidote of your viper for the strengthening of your opinion; the very names which are given by the Greekes and Latines to this creature, shew that this is no fiction; for <gap reason="foreign">

Is it a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible thing for an aspe to stop his eare, then for a Serpent to speake and discourse, as he did to <hi>Eva.</hi> I could tell you strange sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Serpent <hi>Epidaurius</hi> at Rome; of that Serpent that bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ejection of <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> and of others recorded by grave Historians, which I will not account fabulous, though you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will; because I know that Satan by permission can doe strange things. 6. It is manifest that beasts, birds, and fishes, are diversly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> affected, with joy, fear, courage, anger, &amp;c. according to the qualitie of the sound which they heare: why then should the relation of the aspe stopping his care be accounted so incredible? It may be as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for him to stop his eare at an ungratefull sound, as for other creatures to run away from it. 7.

The windes doe vary according to the climate they blow through, and yet they keep not the same tenure still in the same climate: the North-winde is ordinarily cold and dry in that climate, where these Scriptures of <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Proverbs</hi> were penned; and the Scripture speaketh onely of that climate:<note place="margin">

But what will you inferre upon this? marry that this proposition, the earth is immoveable, containes not a generall truth, because the North-winde is not generally cold and drie; as if you would say, this proposition, the sea ebbes and flowes, containes not a generall truth; <hi>ergo,</hi> this proposition, man is a reasonable creature, is not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally true; who will not laugh <hi>petulants splene,</hi> to heare such Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick? But you give a reason why this phrase of the coldnesse and drinesse of the North-winde is not generally true, because in some places it is hot and moist: prove unto us that the earth in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces moves circularly, and then we will yeeld that this phrase of the earths immobility is not generally true. 2. These Scriptures which you alledge for the coldnesse of the North-wind may be diversly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood: for <hi>Iob</hi> 37.9. there is mention made of dispersers or scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, but not of the North-wind: and this quality is in every wind to disperse the clouds, as well as to bring them.

How will the truth of his miracles, the terrour of his judgements, the greatnesse of his majestie be seene, if these things shall not truely and really be effected? you may as well say, that all former mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were but in shew or appearance: as Christs turning of water into wine; his walking on the Sea; his raising of the dead; curing of diseases; appeasing of the storme, &amp;c. Is it a thing more incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Sun to be miraculously darkened at Christs second co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, then it was at his passion, when the Sun lost his light, the Moone being at full? Which miracle was acknowledged by that learned Areopagite, being then in Egypt. Or is it more incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Moone shall be turned into bloud, then for clouds to raine bloud? of which bloudy showers, you may read in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and French stories, and in our owne Chronicles at home, of bloud that rained seaven dayes together in this Island, so that the milke was turned into bloud. What say you of all the waters of Egypt which were turned into bloud? and if wee may beleeve the Church stories, when <hi>Felix</hi> the Martyr suffered, for not delivering up the Bible to be burned, about the yeare of Christ, 302. the Moone was turned into bloud: thus God is able to make your world in the Moone Aceldama.

God is as able to shake the Heavens, and the Stars from them, as a winde is to shake a fig-tree and spoile it of leaves: he that setled the Stars may remove them. And to tell us that these Meteors which wee

I confesse my ignorance in the most of these naturall causes; Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers reasons are not satisfactory to me:
<q>Obstat cui gelidus circum praecordia sanguis.</q>
But if the wiser sort know from whence the winde commeth, which the vulgar doe not; so likewise must the wayes of the Spirit in our regeneration be known to them also, though not to the vulgar: but sure that is not Christs meaning; for he meanes that the way and manner of our regeneration are as hid &amp; secret to men without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, as the wayes of the winde are: and as none knows the one, so none the other. 2. If you know from whence the winde cometh, and whither it goeth, I pray tell us, and hide not your light under a bushell: perhaps you will say that it cometh from North, or South, East, or West; if you can say no more, you were as good lay your finger on your lip with <hi>Harpocrates,</hi> and say nothing. For tell us, out of what part of the earth or sea doth the North-winde arise, when it blowes over our Island; and how farre doth it goe, or where doth it end? Whence came the great South-West-winde, which the 27. of <hi>December</hi> last sunke so many ships, overturned so many trees, overthrew so many barnes and dwelling houses? and where did this winde end? Can you tell us whence the Brises or trade-windes under the line which blow continually from East to West, doe proceed? or doe you know whence the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarie windes in Egypt, called <hi>Etesiae,</hi> doe come? These begin to blow when the dog-starre ariseth, and continue forty dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; such windes blow in Spaine and Asia, but from the East; in <hi>Pontus</hi> from the North. I thinke that though you should aske of the Finlanders who used to sell windes, (if you will beleeve <hi>Olaus</hi>)
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49171:25"/>
they cannot informe you. 3. How can Philosophers tell us from whence the winde cometh, when they know not as yet what the winde is, whether an exhalation, or the aire moved, whether it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out of the sea, as <hi>Homer</hi> thinks, or out of the bowells and caves of the earth, as others suppose. <hi>Pliny</hi> will tell you of Caves where the winde blowes continually; and <hi>Neptune,</hi> in <hi>Virgil,</hi> will shew you, that <hi>AEolus</hi> hath no power in his kingdome, but in the hollow caves and rockes of the earth:

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49171:27"/>
is the contemplation or knowledge of divine and naturall things; both which are handled in Scripture, divine things principally, naturall things in the second place; that by naturall things we may come to the knowledge of Divinity, and by this to the attainment of eternall felicity. Therefore in Scripture is recorded the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the cause, qualities, and effects of the creature, that by these we may come to the knowledge of the Creator. If the Gentile Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers had not found much Philosophy in Scripture, they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conveighed so much out of it, (as they did) into their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophicall books,<note place="margin">

                  </note> as <hi>Theodore</hi> sheweth. The idle opinions of many Philosophers, which are grounded neither on sense, nor reason, (as yours of the Earth's motion) are not to be sought for in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but Philosophicall truths which are grounded on either, or both, may be sought and found there: and whatsoever idle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits the Jewes have had of Scripture, or their idle fables which they have grounded on it, concerne us not: they were a giddy headed people, given over to a reprobate sense, groping at noone day; having their hearts fat, and their eyes blinded, that they may not see: their seeking for Philosophicall truths in Scripture was not the cause of their foolishnesse, (for few or none of them were addicted to the study of Philosophy) but their owne voluntary blindnesse, pride, stubbornnesse, and contempt of Christ the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and essentiall Word of God, are the causes of their ignorance in the externall Word; so that they (having forsaken the truth) follow lyes. But as for the Christian Doctors, they have not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed themselves to errours, by adhering to the words of Scripture, but you are fallen into grosse errors by rejecting the words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: These which you count errours, are truths; as, That the Sun and Moon are the greatest lights, That there are waters above the firmament, That the starres are innumerable, as wee have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy shewed.

Hence then it appeares that the Fathers are not mistaken, in attributing the not over-flowing of the sea to a miracle: howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever (as your figure sheweth) the sea may seem to be, and yet is not

Neither is there any contradiction in Scripture, though sometime it make the sea higher then the land, and sometime lower; for so it is according to the diversity of coasts; and because of much moisture and water found in the bowels of the earth, and in that it is encompassed with the sea, it may be said, that the earth is founded on the waters: therefore no man can be deceived in concluding points of Philosophie from expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scriptures (as you say) but from the misunderstanding of Scripture; for what is true in Philosophie cannot be false in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie; for in subalternall sciences there can be no repugnancy.</p>

               <p>YOu would faine here overthrow those Scriptures which shew the immobilitie of the earth.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1.4.</note> 1. That place of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> (<hi>one generation cometh, and another passeth, but the earth standeth for ever.</hi>) You say, <hi>That it is not the purpose of this place to deny all kinde of motion to the whole earth; but that of generation and corruption.</hi> But I say, that it is neither the purpose of this place to deny the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the earth, nor to affirme the motion of the sunne: for why should he either deny the one, or affirme the other, which no man doubted of, or called in question? his drift is to prove the vanity of mankinde, from the stability of the earth, and motion of the sun, windes and waters; thus man is inferiour to the earth, because the earth is firme, stable, and immoveable; whereas man abideth not in one stay, <hi>but cometh forth like a flower, and is cut downe, he flyeth like a shadow, and continueth not.</hi> Or (as it is here) <hi>he cometh and goeth</hi>; so that coming &amp; going are motions, to which man is subject, and are opposite to the immobilitie of the earth. The Antithesis then or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position here is not between the substance of man and of the earth;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49171:29"/>
for man in respect of his substance is permanent as well as the earth, if either we consider his soule, or his body, according to the first matter; but the opposition is between the qualities, outward estate, and life of man, and the immobilitie of the earth, so that the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the earth must be meant either of its permanency, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutabilitie, or immobilitie: not the first, for man (as I said) is not inferiour to the earth in permancie; not the second, for the earth is subject (as all sublunary things are) to mutability and changes; therefore the third, which is the earths immobility, must needs be understood. And if <hi>Solomon</hi> had thought otherwise, to wit, that the earth moved, and the sun stood still; he would have said, <hi>The sunne standeth for ever, the earth ariseth, and the earth goeth downe, &amp;c.</hi> But, for all his knowledge, he was ignorant of this quaint piece of Philosophie. Againe, he proves mans vanity from the motion of the sunne, windes, and waters, though they move and are gone for a while, yet they returne againe; but man being gone returnes no more: so that man hath neither the stability of the earth, but pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth away, and being past, hath not the power to returne againe, as the sunne, winde, and waters doe. It is plaine then, that the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the earth is opposed to its locall motion, and to the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men coming and going; but it were ridiculous, as you say, to inferre that the earth is immoveable, because permanent; for the mill and ship may be permanent, and yet move; this illation is none of ours, we say it is immoveable because <hi>Solomon</hi> here sayes so; for he saith it standeth; and if standing be motion, then the earth moves. It is more safe for us to say, That the earth is immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable, because <hi>Solomon</hi> saith it stands; then to say it is moveable, because the word standing may signifie permanency, or abiding. As for the motions (as you cal them) of generation and corruption, from which you free the earth, they are not indeed motions, but mutations: <hi>Metus est à termino positivo, ad terminum poserivum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You checke the Jewes for collecting the earths eternity from the word (<hi>Legnolam:</hi>) albeit I know that this word doth not alway signifie eternity, but a long continuance of time; yet that the earth is eternall, <hi>à posteriori,</hi> I thinke you will not deny, except you will tread in some new way of your owne different from that both of ancient and modern Divines, who affirme with the Scripture, That <hi>there shall be a new earth</hi>; but new in qualities, not in substance; a change of the figure, not of the nature; of the forme, not of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; a renovation of that beauty which is lost by man, but no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49171:29"/>
of a new Essence; so that the Jewes might justly inferre from <hi>Solomons</hi> words, that <hi>the earth is eternall,</hi> or <hi>stablished for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You snap at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Fuller</hi> for urging that these words of <hi>Solomon</hi> must be all understood literally, and not some of them in reference to appearance, but without cause; for can the same Scripture with one breath blow hot and cold? At the same time speake plainly and ambiguously; in the same sentence have a double meaning? The Scripture which is plaine and simple, is farre from double dealing. Will any thinke that when <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, There be three moveable bodies, the Sun, Windes, and Rivers that there are indeed but two; and that the Sun moves not but in appearance, that is, moves not at all? This is to make the Scripture indeed a nose of wax; for what may I not interpret this way? Christ fed the people with five barley loaves, that is, with foure loaves, for one was a loafe but in appearance. Three Wise-men came from Persia to worship Christ, that is, two came indeed, but the third came onely in appearance. You would laugh at me, if I should tell you, that of any three ships or mills, which move really, one did move apparently; whereas both you &amp; I see them move really. Now, if the Sun doth not move, why doth the Scripture say it doth? What danger would arise if it spoke plaine in this point? You say, <hi>That the Scripture speaks of some naturall things, as they are esteemed by mans false conceipt</hi>: But this is a false conceit of yours; the Scripture doth not cherish or patronise the falshood of our conceits; the end of it is to rectifie our erroneous conceits. It is true that in high and obscure points of Divinitie, the Scripture condescending to our capacity, useth the tearms of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and earthly things; that by them we may by degrees ascend to the love and knowledge of spirituall things; for the naturall man understandeth not the things of God: but in naturall things which are obvious to our senses, we need no such helps. If the Sunne stood still, it were as easie for us to understand his standing, as his moving.</p>
               <p>What you talke of the ends of a staffe, and of the ends of the earth, is impertinent and frivolous; for the Scripture for want of proper words useth metaphoricall: and because there is no other word to expresse the remote bounds of the earth, then the word <hi>End,</hi> therefore the Scripture useth it. But you inferre that because the ends of a staffe, and the ends of the earth cannot be taken in the same sense; that therefore the motion of the sun, and of the winds must be understood in divers senses: make an Enthymeme and see the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49171:30"/>
consequence; the Scripture saith, That <hi>a staffe hath ends,</hi> and that <hi>the earth hath ends,</hi> which cannot be understood properly, and in the same sense; <hi>ergo,</hi> when the Scripture saith, <hi>The sunne moveth, and the winde moveth,</hi> both cannot be understood properly and in the same sense: as if you would say, The Scripture affirms that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are the sons of God, and that Judges are the sons of God, but not in the same sense: <hi>ergo,</hi> when the Scripture saith, <hi>That the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven flew out of the Arke, and the dove flew out of the Arke:</hi> both must not be understood in the same sense, but the one properly, the other in appearance.</p>

                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5.</note>Our second proofe out of Scripture which you goe about to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine, is that of Saint <hi>Peter: The heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water, and in the water.</hi> You say, <hi>That the word <gap reason="foreign">

This were to commit a plaine tantology, for so the words must run; The earth was, was out of the water; if these two words (<hi>was</hi>) and (<hi>standing</hi>) be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent. 3. The Apostles scope is not only to shew that God made all the earth, (as you say) but that he made it thus; that is, standing or immoveable: that he is the authour not onely of its being and essence, but also of that inseparable accident of immobilitie. 4. We collect not the rest and immobilitie of the earth from the bare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of its being or creation, but from its being thus made; for so we may reason; What God hath made to stand fast out of, and in the water, is immoveable; but God hath made the earth thus: <hi>ergo,</hi> it is immoveable. 5. <hi>It were ridiculous to conclude the immobility of a ship or a mill-wheele, because a part of them was made to stand above, and another part under the water for they were not made for that end to stand, but to move:</hi> But if you had brought your Simile from the rockes of the sea, you had done well; for God made these rockes to stand partly above, and partly under the water; and hee made them not to fleete with the Isles of the lake Lommond, therefore they are not moveable, for God hath made them immoveable; and so hee hath made the earth: therefore, both the old and new Latine translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, doe use the word <hi>consistere,</hi> which signifieth <hi>constanter stare.</hi>

No: for there is the stability of nature, and naturall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, which is opposite to mutability, and so the heavens are establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; and there is the stability of rest, and so it is opposite to mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: thus the earth is established. But, you will say, seeing the same word [<hi>establish</hi>] is spoken of both the heaven, and of the earth, how shall you know that it implyeth immobility in the earth, and not in the heaven? I answer, well enough; because the Scripture, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the earth, saith, <hi>It is established that it cannot be moved:</hi> but the Scripture never speakes so of the heavens, but onely that they are <hi>established</hi>; not a word to shew any rest or immobility in them.</p>
               <p>Now you urge us with those places that speak of <hi>establishing of the Moon, Ps.89.37.</hi> of <hi>the stars, Psa.8.3.</hi> of <hi>the heavens, Pro. 8.27. Why</hi> (say you) <hi>should these be counted sufficient expressions to take away motion from the earth</hi>? I answer, we do not count this word [<hi>establish</hi>] of it self a sufficient expression; for the originall word is ambiguous, and diversly interpreted, both by the Greek and Latine; and moveable things may be established; the moving Tabernacle, as well as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Temple. But if I should tell you, that though the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle be fastened or established, yet it is moveable, and the Temple is so stablished that it cannot be moved: You cannot but say, that my expression is sufficient to shew the difference of stability in the one,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Thou hast founded,</hi> [or established] <hi>the earth, and it shall stand: Thou hast laid the foundations of the earth, that it shall not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for ever</hi>; so it is in the Hebrew. When a thing then is said to be so established, as that it standeth fast on a sure foundation, and cannot
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49171:31"/>
be moved, wee must needs acknowledge, that this is a full expression of its immobility; which phrases are never spoken of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or any starre; wee reade that the Sun stood once, but that was by miracle: of any other standing in Scripture we never read. So we read of the moving of the earth by earthquakes, but not else, <hi>Isa.</hi> 13.13. and of removing of Islands, <hi>Rev.</hi>6.14. but never of a circular motion of the earth: for in that respect he hath made the earth that it shall not be moved. And to tell us, as you do, that the earth is establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed so onely that it shall not be removed, is both to mince the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the power of God; for as it is more easie to move an heavy body then to remove it, so is the power of God so much the greater, in that hee hath made a body of such solidity, weight, and bignesse, that it cannot be so much as moved, farre lesse removed: and if the Scripture be so carefull and punctuall in setting forth Gods great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and power on so small a matter, as is the moving of a little part of the earth by earthquakes; doubtlesse it would not have been silent in a matter of such admiration and power, as is the moving of the whole body of the earth, if ever hee had moved it, either by himselfe, or by his Angels, or by Nature his handmaid.</p>
               <p>Whereas you say, <hi>That</hi> fundavit <hi>cannot be taken properly, as if the earth, like other artificiall buildings, did need any bottoms to uphold it.</hi> I answer, that <hi>fundare terram</hi> is not to settle the earth upon a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or bottome, but to make it the foundation of all heavy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and therefore it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>fundum,</hi> the bottome, and <hi>fundus,</hi> the foundation; so that nothing hath any foundation but on and by the earth. Ships floating on the water, have not any foundation, till they be tyed by anchors to the earth; which the Poet knew, when he said,
<q>Anchora fundabat naves:</q>
therefore not metaphorically, but properly, doth the Scripture speak, in saying, <hi>God hath founded the earth</hi>; but whereas the heavens are said to have foundations, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>22.8. by heavens there are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the mountaines, and so the vulgar Latine reads it: and so in <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.8 the text hath mountaines, and not heavens. Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines are called heavens metonymically, because they are in that part of heaven which we call the aire; therefore by the Poets they are called, <hi>Aërel montes</hi>; and so all the space from the superficies of the earth upward, is called heaven both in sacred and profane wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; even this upper part of the earth wherein wee live is called heaven by the Poet:
<q>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49171:32"/>Sed falsa ad Coelum mittunt insomnia Manes;</q>
and the Inhabitants of the earth are called <hi>Superi</hi> by the same Poet,
<q>Quae quis apud Superos surto laetat us inani.</q>
And as hills are called heaven, so heaven is called hills by <hi>David,</hi> when hee saith, <hi>I will look unto the bills, from whence cometh my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> By the foundation of the heavens then, is meant nothing else but the foundation of the hills. Now why you should call the earth an artificiall building, I know not: it was neither built by an artificer, nor by the rules and tooles of Art; your earth in the Moon may rather be called artificiall, as being the work, not of God, nor Nature, but of <hi>Copernicus</hi> the master carpenter, and his workmen, of which number you are one; but you should doe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if with that wise master builder St. <hi>Paul,</hi> you would build upon the corner stone, and the foundation Christ Jesus, according to the grace of God which is given to you.</p>
               <p>You say well, <hi>That the pillars of heaven mentioned by <hi>Job</hi> will not prove them to be immoveable</hi>; for wee know that heavenly pillars are moveable as the heavens are: so were these two pillars that condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Israel through the desart, and those night meteors, called fierie pillars. 2. By <hi>heaven</hi> may be meant the Church called oftentimes heaven in Scripture, and by pillars the eminent Doctors of it: So <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> were called pillars, and every good man shall be made a pillar in Gods Temple. 3. By the pillars of heaven may be understood the Angels, called also the powers of heaven, in the Gospell. 4. High hills may be called pillars of heaven, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they uphold heaven, as the Poets write of <hi>Atlas,</hi> but because they are high in the aire, which is called heaven,
<q>— caput inter nubila coxdunt.</q>
5. The onely true pillar by which both heaven and earth is sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the power of God; which power cannot be shaken in it selfe, but in its effects. 6. Which way soever you take the pillars of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven they are moveable; but now it will not follow that the pillars of earth are moveable also: though the pillars of the Tabernacle were moveable, the pillars of the Temple were not so. Such as the earth is, such be its pillars; its selfe is immoveable, and so are its pillars; except when that great <hi>Sampson</hi> shakes them being grieved for the many wrongs that hee suffers by our sins; then hills, rocks, houses, and cities tumble down, and multitudes are buried before they be dead. If then we should prove the immobility of the earth, from the stability of its pillars, wee should have reason for it; but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49171:32"/>
to inferre that the heavens were immoveable, because they have pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, were ridiculous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We read</hi> (say you) <hi>of ends, sides, and corners of the earth, and yet these will not prove it to be of a long or square forme. Answ.</hi> Yes it will: for the Scripture doth not describe the earth to us as a smooth and uniforme globe, but as a great body consisting of divers une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall parts; as hills and vallies, and as a body broken by the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of many seas, as the Mediterran, &amp;c. Consisting also of lakes and rivers, not to speake of Isles and Isthmus: hath not then the earth in this respect many ends, corners, and sides? If you did saile along the coasts of the earth, you should finde it so. 2. The earth of it selfe is not round, for without the water it doth not make a globe. 3. Though it were perfectly round, yet it must have its longitude and latitude. 4. By the earth the Scripture often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meanes the land of Judea, with the neighbouring countreys: as, his dominion shall be from the river to the ends of the earth; which words were spoken of <hi>Solomon</hi> literally. <hi>All the ends of the earth have seene the salvation of God</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 98.3.</note> which was not seen by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans in <hi>Davids</hi> dayes. So all the world was taxed under <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> that is, the Roman world. 5.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 2.</note> Whatsoever is finite hath bounds and ends, but such is the earth; <hi>ergo,</hi> it hath ends. Therefore as the Scripture by the ends, sides, and corners of the earth, doth shew that it is not round; so doth it also by the stable foundations thereof, shew, that it doth not move.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaketh of the planting of the heavens, which you say,<note place="margin">51.6.</note> 
                  <hi>May as well prove them to be immoveable, as that which followes in that Verse concerning the foundation of the earth. Answ.</hi> I perceive your case is desperate, for like a man that is sinking in the water, you catch hold of every thing that is next you, though it be weeds and such as cannot help you. For 1. by heavens here may be meant the Church, which is that Vine, that God hath planted with his owne right hand. 2. Though this word heaven were taken in its proper signification, yet the planting of heaven is a metaphor, out of which you can conclude nothing, but must spoile your Syllogisme with <hi>quatuor termini.</hi> 3. Nothing is properly planted but what hath motion in it, as trees, hearbs, and such like vegetables. This word then may intimate, that there is motion in the heavens, as the word (<hi>foundation</hi>) sheweth, that there is no motion in the earth; for it is very improper and dangerous for a foundation to move.</p>
               <p>When the Scripture saith, <hi>The earth is established: by this word</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:49171:33"/>
you answer) <hi>is means onely the keeping of it up in the aire, without fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to any other place. Answ.</hi> If the earth be established onely so, that it may not fall or be removed to any other place; what singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thing hath the earth, that is not in other bodies? for so are the heavens established, and every starre, that they shall not be removed out of that place or station which is appointed for them; so is the sea confined within its bounds, which it cannot passe. But there is something else in the earth whereby it differs from other bodies, and wherein Gods power is the more admired; to wit, <hi>That it is so established, that it cannot be removed:</hi> Nay, more then so, it cannot be stirred or wagged at all. Thus as Gods glory is admired in the perpetuall motion of other bodies, so is it in the perpetuall immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of this. 2. <hi>The earth</hi> (you say) <hi>is kept up from falling.</hi> I pray you whither would the earth fall, being in its owne place, and sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of all the Elements? if it fall any where, it must fall upward, and that is as proper a phrase, as if I should tell you, the heaven must mount downeward: therefore, <hi>Mute hauc de poctore euram</hi>; never feare the falling of the earth. The Gentiles were afraid that the heavens might fall being held up by the shoulders of <hi>Hercules</hi>; therefore <hi>Artemon</hi> it seemes was afraid of this, who never durst ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abroad, but under a brasen target, carried over his head. And one <hi>Phaenaces</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> was sore afraid, that the moon would fall downe, and therefore pitied the Ethiopians and others that were under the moone; but if he had knowne what you know, That there is a world in the moone, his feare had been just. It may be the great shower of stones that fell heretofore <hi>in agro Piceno,</hi> were the stones of some buildings that had fallen downe in the moone. We need not feare the falling of our earth, which God hath so esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, that it cannot be moved.</p>

                  <hi>You see no reason, but that we may prove the naturall motion of the earth from that place in Iob, Who moveth or shaketh the earth out of her place</hi>; that is to say, We may prove a naturall motion out of a violent, or one contrary out of another; we may prove the fire to be cold, because it is hot; or that the earth may move naturally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canse it moves violently. The motion that <hi>Iob</hi> speakes of, is an earth-quake extraordinary, which is a violent and temporary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of some part only; and a concussion rather then a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the motion that you would inferre from thence, is a naturall, perpetuall, totall, regular, and a circular motion. Will you inferre that because the mill-wheele is turned about violently, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49171:33"/>
the whole mill is turned about naturally. I have seen a Church-tower shake when the bells have been rung; but if I should inferre that the whole Church therefore may move circularly, I should feare,
<q>Nè manus auriculas imitetur mobilis albas:</q>
lest I should be thought a creature of Arcadia. And I hope you are not so simple as to thinke that God did ever shake the whole earth out of its place, or if he had, that therefore it may move natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and circularly.</p>

                  <hi>HEre you will not upon any tearmes admit, that the earth is the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Vniverse, because our arguments</hi> (you say) <hi>are insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Answ.</hi> Our arguments may be insufficient to you, who hath an overweening conceit of your selfe, and a prejudiciall opinion of other men. But our arguments have been hitherto accounted suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, by moderate, wise, and learned men; but to your sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted understanding they give no satisfaction; there are some men that are never content, and nothing to them is sufficient, no not Gods owne word: but what though our arguments were insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient? will you therefore reject them? You may by this meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all humane learning, for it hath not that sufficiency which perhaps you require. We know here but in part, the sufficiency of knowledge is reserved for a better life. — <hi>Si quid tamen aptius exit:</hi> But if you have more sufficient arguments for your opinion, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part them to us, and we will imbrace them; if you have not, <hi>his utere mecum</hi>; content your selfe with these till you know better. But you promise that you will cleerly manifest the insufficiency of our arguments in this Chapter. Let us see if you will be as good as your word, which we have not yet found in you; only, large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises without performance.</p>

               <p n="1">1. We say that the earth is the center, not the sun; because the earth is lowermost, and under the sunne. To this you answer, <hi>That
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49171:34"/>
since the sun is so remote from the center of our earth, it may be properly affirmed that we are under it, though that be in the center of the world. Answ.</hi> That the sunne cannot be the center of the world, and that the earth must needs be the center;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>sec.</hi> 2.</note> we have proved against <hi>Lansber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> for neither could there be Eclipses of the Moone, nor could we discerne the medietie of heaven, nor of the Zodiac, if the earth were not the center. And whereas the center is the middle of the globe equally distant from all the parts of the circumference; the wise God placed the earth in the midst of this great systeme of the world, not onely for mans sake, who being the Lord of this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, and the most honourable of all the creatures, deserved to have the most honourable place, which is the middle: but chiefly that man with all other animall and vegetable creatures, might by an equall distance from all parts of heaven have an equall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and influence. For imagine there were two earths, this which is in the center, and another out of the center; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and powers of heaven must needs more equally concurre and be united in this, then in that: and if the place be it which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the creatures, what place more fit for conservation, then that which is in the midst of the world? Having an equall relation to all parts of heaven, and all the powers of the universe uniting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together in the earth, as in a small epitome. Therefore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is the hand-maid and imitatour of God, layes up the seed in the middle of the fruits, as being not onely the safest part, but also because in the middle as in the center, all the powers of the plant meet together in the forming of the seed, wherein it doth perpetuate it self. How unconvenient and unhealthy were mans habitation, if it were neerer the heaven then it is? for the aire would be too pure and unproportionable to our grosse bodies, for they that travell overhigh hils find their bodies much distempered. <hi>Acosta</hi> witnesseth, that they who travel over the high hils of Peru, fall into vomiting, &amp; become desperately sick, and many lose their lives, by reason of the subtilty &amp; purenes of the air. But your words would be a little corrected; For <hi>since the sun</hi> (you say) <hi>is so remote from the center of the earth, we are under it.</hi> Indeed we are under it, in that it is above us; but not for that it is remote from us or from the earth. <hi>Under</hi> and <hi>above</hi> are relative tearms, so are <hi>neerenes</hi> &amp; <hi>remotenes.</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49171:34"/>
so you may call any doctrine in Scripture, for where will you have hell to be, but either in heaven or in the earth? These are the two integrall parts of this universe; in heaven I hope you will not place it, except you will have it to be in the moone. But if there be any hell there, it is for the wicked of that world: as for the wicked of this world, they are not said to ascend to hell in the moone, but to descend to hell in the earth, as <hi>Core</hi> and his fellowes.

               <p n="3">3. These things also you will have to be uncertaine. 1. <hi>That bodies must be as farre distant in place as in nobility.</hi> 2. <hi>That the earth is of a baser matter than other Planets.</hi> 3. <hi>That the center is the worst place. Answ.</hi> These are not uncertainties to men that have sense and reason; for sense tells us, that the grosser simple bodies are, the lower place have they in this Universe: the heaven being a quintessence and of the purest matter, is uppermost; next is the fire, then the aire, then the water, and lowest of all, the earth, as being the grossest; and reason tells us, that God is the God of order; and what a disordered world should we have, if grosse and heavy bodies were uppermost, the light and purest bodies beneath? We see in our owne bodies, that the grosser the spirits are, the lower they are: the animall having their residence in the head, the vitall in the heart, the naturall in the liver. 2. Nor is it uncertaine that the earth is of a baser matter then the Planets; the obscurity and dulnesse of the one; the beauty, light, and swiftnesse of the other, doe shew what oddes there is in the matter. How are all Divines deceived who put men in minde of the base materialls of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and teach that God made men of the basest element to humble him? <hi>Animalium superbissimi origo vilissima</hi>;<note place="margin">

                  </note> and I thinke you are Planet-struck, or have a planeticall head, who thinke the earth to be a Planet. 3. That the center is the worst place, is not held by us; for though we say the earth to be the ignoblest and basest ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in respect of its matter, and therefore the lowest; yet as it is the center and habitation of the noblest creature, it is placed in the middle, as being the noblest place.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our second argument is grounded (you say) upon two foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish foundations. 1. That the whole frame of nature moves round, excepting onely the earth. 2. That the whole earth is heavy, and more unfit for motion then the Planets: <hi>These you reject, because they are</hi> (you say) <hi>the thing in question. Answ.</hi> You are doubtlesse that third <hi>Cato</hi> that fell from heaven; or <hi>octavus Sapientum.</hi> Our foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the earths stability, and gravity, are foolishnesse with
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49171:35"/>
you; so was the Gospell foolishnesse to the Gentiles; but you doe well to observe <hi>Solomons</hi> rule:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Answer not a foole according to his folly</hi>; which is the reason that you answer not at all to these foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish foundations of ours; but onely with this; they are the thing in question. But if you question the stability and gravity of the earth, is not your question as foolish as our foundation? but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you may question every thing, every thing may be a foolish answer, or position to you. And what doe you thinke of the Scripture when it saith; <hi>The earth standeth fast, and the stars move?</hi> doth the Scripture in this speake foolishly? Surely we are content to preferre the foolishnesse of Scripture to the wisdome of your scribling; because such conceited wisdome is but foolishnesse with God. What foundation either in Divinity or Philosophy, what Article of the Creed hath not been questioned? shall they be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted foolish foundations, or unfit to discusse controversies, because they have been questioned by pernicious Heretickes? If you were as wise a man as you pretend your selfe to be, you should have with solid arguments refelled our foundations, which are so fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by so many Philosophers, and then you should have shot your fooles bolt. The truth of these foundations I have shewed already, to which you answer nothing,<note place="margin">Contra Lans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg.</note> therefore here I will not <hi>actum agere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Our third Argument is, That our earth, must be in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because it is in the lowest place, or middest of the world; this <hi>Aristotle</hi> proves by the descending of all heavy to the center, and the ascending of light bodies from it: <hi>But you reject</hi> Aristotle <hi>as being a master of Syllogismes, and being deceived whilst be supposeth that, which he pretends to prove.</hi> But indeed you are much deceived your selfe, whilst you reject this master of Syllogismes, who doth not suppose what he pretends to prove, but substantially proves, what you thinke hee supposeth. Hee saith the earth is the center, and thus syllogistically out of him it is proved; To what place heavy bodies descend, that place is the center; But to the earth, heavy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies descend; <hi>ergo,</hi> the earth is the center. You see now that this master of Syllogismes doth not suppose that which he brings unto the conclusion, but proves the earth to be the center by a <hi>medium,</hi> which you cannot answer: so that being put to your shifts, you know not how to elude the force of this and other arguments; but by falling to your art of multiplying centers and circumferences, which is not difficult to you, that can multiply worlds. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49171:36"/>
cause you cannot be so impudent as to deny the ascending of light bodies; you say, <hi>That they ascend to some circumference which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reasonably affirme to be concentricall with that of the world.</hi> But I would know of you, how you can reasonably affirme that circle to be eccentricall, which we sensibly perceive to be concentricall to the world? If neither you nor we can perceive that circumference to which light bodies ascend eccentricall to the world, what reason have you to affirme it? or how doe you prove what you affirme? May you not as well tell us, that there are more suns then this one which we see? For you will say that we cannot reasonably affirme there is but one sun. But you say, <hi>We cannot prove the descent of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy bodies to the center, nor the ascent of light bodies to the circumference of the world; because all our experience in this kind, extends but to things that are on earth, or in the aire above it.</hi> I pray you good Sir, how farre doth your experience reach beyond ours, that you should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this our assertion? Have you beene in the moone, and observed that which we cannot finde here below? We see <hi>quantum acie pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt oculi servare,</hi> as farre as our eyes will give us leave; to wit, light bodies mounting from the center towards the circumference; doe you see otherwise? I know you doe not, and cannot though you had as many eyes as <hi>Argus:</hi> therefore keep your wilde opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to your selfe, for so long as you can neither by sense nor reason perswade us, your bare word will be too weake an argument to worke upon our beliefe. You conclude, <hi>That it were a senslesse thing, from our experience of so little a part, to pronounce any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly concerning the scituation of the whole.</hi> I grant our experience to be little, but yours is lesse, or none at all: a little is better then none, and we may more boldly inferre, that there is but one cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and one circumference; (because all light things ascend to one circumference, and all heavy things descend to one center) then you can inferre two centers, and two circumferences; whereas you never knew any light thing ascend, or heavy thing descend to any other circumference and center, then to these which we maintaine: are not you therefore much more senslesse then we? for we follow the direction both of our sense and reason; so doe not you.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Our Astonomicall reasons you refell as wisely as you have done the rest: for you grant us, <hi>That the earth is in the midst of the equinoctiall, horizon, and other circles; but you deny that from hence can be concluded that it is in the center of the world.</hi> It seemes then that the equinoctiall, &amp;c. are not concentricall to the world, and that the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49171:36"/>
earth may be in the midst of the horizon and equator, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much distant from the center; and what is this but to make another world? consisting of another heaven and earth? For if this earth be under any other equinoctiall besides that of the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum mobile,</hi> or any other horizon, it cannot have the heaven equally on all sides of it, and so cannot be in the lowest place which is the center, though it be the heaviest body; and so against its nature must be higher then that body which is in the center. This is to take away that order which God hath placed in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to multiply worlds, and to bring in a strange confusion. And what a wise reason doe you give us why the earth would remaine in the midst of these circles, that is, the equinoctiall, &amp;c. though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the center; <hi>because it is the eye that imagins them to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed about it?</hi> So then the earth doth not goe out of the midst of these circles, because the eye imagines them, &amp;c. You have a strange fascinating eye, that can keepe the earth within its circles; if you should winke; or if you lose your eyes with your great patron `<hi>Democritus,</hi> would not the earth give you the slip and fall out of your circles into the center of the world? Besides, I had thought that the action of the eye had been to see, not to imagine. As you have made a confused Chaos in the great world, so you doe in the little world too, confounding the inward and outward senses, the sight and the imagination: I thinke you were begot of <hi>Chaos</hi> and <hi>caligo.</hi> Againe, what a reaching eye have you, that can describe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles about the earth? If you had spoken of an artificiall Globe, you had said something; but if your eye were as big as that of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyphemus,</hi>
                  <q>Argolici clypei, aut Phoebaeae lampadis instar,</q>
yet you could not describe with your eye a circle about the earth: your imagination may describe it, but not your eye: your imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation cannot be the cause why the earth remaines within its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; your imagination must be conformable to the reality of things, and not they to your imagination: for though you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that there is a world in the moone, that the earth moves, &amp;c. yet there is no such thing, because the earth is in the center: wee imagine it to be so, and beleeve it also; but our imagination or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe do not make it to be so; therefore, our collection is not weak when we inferre that the earth is in the center, because it is in the midst of these circles which are concentricall to the world; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the parts and degrees of the earth doe answer in proportion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49171:37"/>
to the parts and degrees of heaven, which they could not well doe if the earth were eccentricall.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now I thinke you go about to conjure us with your figures, circles, and characters, and to hem us in with a circle made by your pen, as <hi>Popilius</hi> the Roman Legate did inclose King <hi>Antiochius</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a circle made with his rod: you remove the earth from one cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to another, with more facility, then <hi>Archimedes</hi> could have done with his engine: you transferre the starres from one circle to another at your pleasure; you can doe I thinke as she in the Poet,
<q>Sistere aquam fluviis &amp; vertere sidera ritro;</q>
and all this stirre is to informe us, that though the earth be never so farre distant from the center of the world; <hi>yet the parts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of your imaginary spheare about it will be alwayes proportionable to the parts and degrees of the earth.</hi> And what of all this? You may imagine what spheares you will, and in your imagination place the earth as you will, yet the earth standeth fast for ever in this great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke of the world as the center, though in your head it move to and fro. You may place the earth upon the top of the <hi>primum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> and imagine a spheare about it, with proportionable degrees, and parts to those of the earth; wee may retort these words upon the sunne your center, that though it be never so farre distant from the center of the world, yet the parts of an imaginary spheare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it will be proportionable to the parts of the sun: but though in your imaginary circle there be a proportion of parts and degrees to the earth removed from the center, I would know if the earth therefore is removed from the center: Or if you should remove the earth ten or twenty degrees neerer the pole Articke, or to the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith of the Meridian from the center; is there, or can there be any proportion between the two hemispheares? Will not the one be so much the lesse, by how much the other is inlarged? Or can the true spheare of heaven be divided equally into twelve parts, or signes, so that sixe be alwayes above the earth, and sixe below? Or can the stars in both hemispheares appeare of the same bignesse? Doubtlesse though you make a proportion in your imaginary spheare, to your imaginary earth, in your imaginary center; yet there can be no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the reall spheare of heaven, and the reall earth, which is the reall center of the world: if it should be removed from its place where it is, your imaginations then are but the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, phansies, and toyes of your head, without ground or solidity; therefore they are neither so strong, nor we so weake, as that they
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49171:37"/>
should make any impression upon our beliefe, as the mothers imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation doth upon the tender Embryo in her wombe.</p>
               <p>When you are pressed with the manifest absurdities and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which arise from removing of the earth from the center of the universe, you have no other way to escape, but like a hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hog, to shrinke back into your imaginary globe or circle: for you grant that the earth must needs be placed both in the axis and aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>but that must be in the center of the spheare which you imagine about it, and not in the midst of this universe.</hi> But why must the earth be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from being the center of the universe, which by sense, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, daily experience, and continuall observation of Astronomers, is knowne to be the center? Why I say must it be removed from its owne reall circle, to your imaginary circle? What inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will follow in the world, if it remaine the center of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse? Or wherein shall the world be bettered, if it be removed to your supposed circle? Nay, what absurdities will not follow upon this removall, which you will never be able to avoid for all your starting hole? for whereas you say, <hi>That though the earth were as far distant from the center, as we conceive the sunne to be, yet it may be still scituated in the very concourse of the axis and aequator.</hi> Truly, though we should conceive it to be so farre distant, yet it would not be still in the concourse of these two lines; for if either the sunne or the earth were there still, there would be a perpetuall equinox through the world, neither would there ever be any increase or decrease of dayes and nights.</p>
               <p>Now you present unto us a Scenography or plat-forme of your imaginarie world, in which, like another <hi>Joshua,</hi> you make the sunne to stand still, so that here is a perpetuall solstice; if that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi> (who would not acknowledge the sunne for a god, because it never rested) had seen your sun, or had known of him what you know, he would have recanted his opinion. What fooles were the Poets to bestow so rich a chariot, and foure prancing horses on the sunne, who could make no use of them? they should have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed this gift upon the earth, for she it is that undertakes all the toile, and <hi>rejoyceth as a Gyant to run her course. Ovid's</hi> second booke of Metamorphosis must be mended, and <hi>Phaeton</hi> must preferre his petition to the Earth his mother, and not to the Sun his father; except perhaps in those dayes the Sun did travell about the Earth, but now being wearie to go about so often, and to take such paines for her thanklesse inhabitants, hath given over this toile, and hath
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49171:38"/>
left the earth to shift for her selfe and children. The reason why you present this figure to us, is to let us see, <hi>That though the sunne be in the center, and the earth in the suns orbe, yet that there can be no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse, but when the sunne and moone are diametrically opposite.</hi> But here your opinion is diametrically opposite to the truth, for the line from the center to the circumference, is but a semidiameter; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the sunne is distant from the moone in your figure, nothing neere a semidiameter, and yet your moone is eclipsed. But what a mishapen world have you made us? in which you have placed the sunne lowermost, and the earth above the sunne, and hath made such a vast circuit for the earth, and such a little circle for the moone. You told us afore, that the earth drawes about the moon, but in your figure it cannot be so; for you have made the earth to compasse the sunne round; but the moone to fetch a compasse of her owne aside off from the sunne: so that whereas you have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the earth in <hi>Aries,</hi> she is between the sunne and the moone, but when she comes about to <hi>Libra</hi> the opposite signe, then the sunne will be between the moon and her. This is indeed a strange world, and doubtlesse none of Gods making; I wish I were out of it, for I am wearie and sorrie to spend time in refuting of such toyes.</p>
               <p>You doe well to confesse the uncertainty of finding out the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act distance of the firmament, which is but conjecturall according to mens fancies, and so indeed are the motions, and magnitudes, and number, and order of the spheares, and starres; about which Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers have so many digladiations and oppositions, which were tedious but to name. From their conjectures and uncertainties have proceeded such a number of conjuring words: as, Trepidati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Retrogradations, Excentricities, concentricities, Epicyles, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions, Recessions, and I cannot tell what; so that as <hi>Cato</hi> said of Sooth-sayers, I may say of Astronomers, It is a wonder that they do not laugh at one another. The best of them all are but
<q>Cu va in terris animae, &amp; coelestium inanes:</q>
They gaze and stare on the stars, and dispute, and assever with great boldnesse, that each star is of such and such a bignesse and altitude, and that they move thus and thus; and that there be so many of each magnitude: and so expert they are, and quick-sighted in these things that are so remote, and yet cannot perceive the things that be hard at hand: therefore <hi>Anaximines</hi> gazing on the stars, fell in the ditch, and was checked by his maid for his curiosity in things beyond his reach, and neglecting that which most concerned him.

               <p n="8">8. From hence appeares the vanity of your side, who thinke, <hi>That the stars would seeme no bigger to us then they now are, though our earth were neerer to them by 2000000. Germane miles, which is granted to be the diameter of that or be wherein the earth is supposed to move.</hi> I pray how come you to know this? by relation, or revelation, or reason, or experience? or have you dreamed it? <hi>Qui amant ipsi sibi somnia singunt.</hi> Or doe you know it by the help of a perspective? You tell us, that the better the perspective is, the lesser it makes the stars to appeare; if my spectacles were of that quality, I could fling them away, and trust to my owne eyes: I wish you could tell us, how many Germane miles would suffice to finde out the true bignesse of the stars; or in how many yeares will the bodies of the Saints be in ascending to heaven; you must pardon us if we beleeve not what you say, such an infinite disproportion doe you make both betweene the bignesse and distance of our earth and the fixed stars. <hi>And though we will not thinke elephants and whales to be fictions and chimaera's, because they are bigger then mice</hi>; yet if you should tell us of a whale that were as big as the Ile of Saint <hi>Laurence,</hi> or of great Britaine; and of an elephant that were able to overturne the Alpes with his trunke; or of a Camell that had a bunch on his backe as high as the cape or top of Tenarisf, we would laugh sooner then beleeve such monstrous absurdities. And yet the disproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these supposed creatures to mice is nothing, to that of the earth and fixed stars. <hi>And the like credit doe we give to that incredible celerity of the eighth spheare, of which Astronomers write, and to the rest of their conceits concerning the reaching of the suns orbe to the pole starre; and that the circle of the pole star is above foure times bigger then the orbe of the sunne; and that the semidiameter of the earth, makes little or no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the appearance of the sunne; as if the observations from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and surface, were of the same exactnesse.</hi> Whereas, never any man hath been in the center to know this, neither doe the Astronomers
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49171:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
agree amongst themselves about the compasse and diameter of the Earth; <hi>Aristotle, Hipparchus, Eratosthenes, Ptolomy, Alphragan, Fernelius,</hi> and the later Professors of that faculty, being all of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinions; so that many Astronomicall principles are grounded upon meere uncertainties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wee doe not ground our argument (as you say) upon this supposition, <hi>That every body must necessarily be of an equall extensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that distance from whence there doth not appeare any sensible differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in its quantity, as you instance in a Bird, and a Tree: as that the Tree should be accounted by us forty paces thick because wee approaching neerer to it by forty paces, doe not finde any sensible difference.</hi> This is a crotchet hammered in your own head, but never supposed by us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wee grant with you, <hi>That it is presumption to conclude that to be superfluous, whose use wee understand not</hi>; but yet wee must needs say, That what is not usefull at all, is superfluous; as that immense and stupendious bignesse, and incredible distance of some starres, seeing they were made for the use of man onely; (for to what other end should they be made?) whereas if they had been neerer and lesser, they might have been more effectuall: Therefore wee cannot beleeve you that they are of that bignesse and distance you speak of. And as for other inhabitants, beside those that are upon this earth, by whom (as you say) these lesser stars may be discerned, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now to say to them; I think you mean your men in the Moon, of whom perhaps I will speak hereafter: and as for these small stars, which you say are lately discovered; I grant that they were made for mans use, though they be scarce discernable; for their influence may be great though their light be small: and we have by them occasion to see how one star differeth from another star in glory, and we may admire Gods greatness in the least, aswell as in the biggest; therefore he hath made Flies aswell as Eagles, and Mice aswell as Elephants.</p>
               <p n="9">9. You chase as if you had been slung with nettles at an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mine against <hi>Lansbergius,</hi> who held, as you doe, that the Sun was the center: my argument is this; That which is least in a circle ought to be the center of it; but the earth is farre lesse then the Sun, and the terrestriall Equinoctiall (<hi>secundum te</hi>) according to your owne words, is the least of all the circles, &amp;c. <hi>This</hi> (you say) <hi>is so simple, that every fresh man would laugh at it, and it would make one suspect, that hee who should urge such an argument, did scarce understand any thing in Astronomy. Answ.</hi> 1. For any great skill that either you or I have in Astronomy, wee may shake hands: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49171:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is not my profession, yet so much I have as is convenient for a Divine, and enough to discover your vaine and ridiculous conceits; and I have not the lesse because of your suspicion: I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand so much as that I dare say there be many absurd and foolish fancies taught by Astronomers, though the science it selfe be usefull in many things. 2. If you, or your fresh men laugh at this argument, you will shew that you have little salt in you, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that salt whereof the Apostle speaks. 3. You shewed more malice then knowledge, more ill-will then skill, in repeating my argument; for you left out (<hi>secundum te</hi>) that is, <hi>according to your owne words</hi>; which sheweth that these were the words of <hi>Lansber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> not mine; to wit, <hi>The terrestriall Equinoctiall is the least of all circles:</hi> So that you cunningly would derive the ignorance and simplicity of your Champion upon mee, whereas I spake in his owne tearmes. 4. I did not speak of the earth, as it had relation to the Moon, or <hi>Mercury,</hi> but in reference to the Sun; for I say that the earth is lesser then the Sun, and therefore fitter to be the center then the Sun, as <hi>Lansbergius</hi> would have it. 5. There is no certainty amongst Astronomers, whether the Earth, Moone, or <hi>Mercury,</hi> be the least spheare. 6. I said, <hi>minimum in circulo,</hi> not <hi>circuli</hi>; that which is least within the circle, not that which is the least part of the circle. The Moon, and the rest of the Planets, are the thicker parts of the spheares, so is not the Earth, it is no part at all of any sphear, but it is within the sphears; therefore the Earth, not the Moon, is fittest to be the center. Thus you have made mee say more now, then I did before. You had no reason then to put so much vinegar in your ink; but you are a namelesse Moon-man wrapt in a cloud:
<q>Cernere ne quis te, ne quis contingere possit.</q>
But be not so high conceited of your selfe; though your habitation be in the Moon, yet learn humility;
<q>Tecum habita, &amp; noris quàm sit tibi curta supellex.</q>
As for the other Objections, which you say are not worth the ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, are indeed such as you know not how to answer them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you slight them, as the Fox did the grapes, which he could not reach.</p>

               </list>
               <p>IN this Proposition you say, <hi>That the Sun may be the center</hi>; and you tell us of <hi>deformities, wheeles,</hi> and <hi>screws, as if Nature in framing of the world had been put to such hard shifts</hi> by Ptolomie's and Tycho's <hi>Hypothesis:</hi> But indeed the wheeles, and screwes you speak of, are the whirle-gigs of your own head; and I hope your Creed is, that not Nature, but the God of Nature, framed the world: but let us consider the weight of your arguments, by which you would prove <hi>Copernicus</hi> his Assertion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You say, <hi>That the light which is diffused in the starres, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the center, which can onely be by placing the Sun there:</hi> so then it seemes by you, that if the Sun were not in the center, the light of the starres could not be so eminently contained and contracted in the Sun: either you must mean that the starres could not receive so much light as they doe from the Sun, or else that the Sun could not have in himselfe so much light as hee hath, if hee were not in the center: But both these are frivolous whimsies; for neither hath any starre its light, because the Sun is in the center, (as you would have) nor would the Sun lose any of his light, if he were out of the center, no more then a candle can lose its light, though it be not placed in the midst of the roome. Now, whether the light of the starres be all one with that of the Sun, or any parcell of it, is not yet fully resolved. In your next Edition tell us more plainly what you meane by the light in the starres contracted in the center, and wee will give you a more satisfactory answer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because <hi>Clavius</hi> and others say, <hi>That the Sun was placed in the midst of the Planets, that hee might the more conveniently distribute his beat and light amongst them; the force of this reason</hi> (you say) <hi>may more properly prove him to be in the center.</hi> I answer, that it will rather prove the Earth to be in the center thus: The Sun is in the midst of the Planets, that they may the more participate of his light; so is the Earth placed in the midst and center of the world, that the Sun might the more conveniently distribute his light and heat to it: for the Sun was made chiefly for the Earth's sake, and the inhabitants thereof; neither doe the stars so much need his light and heat as we, without which we can neither live, nor procreate: and as it is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable whether the stars receive their light from the Sun, (though the Moon doth) so is it much to be doubted that they receive no heat from the Sun, seeing <hi>Saturne</hi> is cold; and the Suns heat comes
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49171:41"/>
by reflexion, which cannot be in the starres.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You say, That the Planets move about the center of the world, and that I grant you; but <hi>Saturne, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury,</hi> move about the body of the Sun; <hi>ergo,</hi> the Sun is in the midst of the world. <hi>Answ.</hi> If you had been better acquainted with the master of Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismes, you had not framed such a lame Syllogisme as this; for thus it runnes in briefer tearmes; some Planets move about the center of the world, some Planets move about the Sun; <hi>ergo,</hi> the Sun is the center of the world. Besides, that it consists all of particulars, the conclusion is falsly inferred against the lawes of the third figure; for it should be formed in the first figure thus: What moves about the Sun, moves about the center of the world: the Planets move a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sun, <hi>ergo,</hi> they move about the center of the world; and all this I grant you, that the Planets move about the earth which is the center: now then I hope you will not say that the Sun is the center of the world, because the Planets move about him; no more then <hi>Iericho</hi> was the center of <hi>Canaan,</hi> because the Priests went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When you tell us that the revolution of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> is about the Sun, because they are never at any great distance from him, you alledge a cause fit to be laughed at; for is the vicinity of one starre to another, the cause of its revolution about that starre? because the mill-wheele is not farre distant from the miller, doth it therefore goe about the miller?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The reason which you alledge from <hi>Pythagoras</hi> is also weak, for though the sunne in respect of his light were the most excellent body, and the center the most excellent place, yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that he is there; for we see that the most excellent creatures are not placed still next the center or in it, but farthest from it: as man is placed in the superficies or circumference of the earth, and not in the center of it the heart is not in the midst of the body; if the middle or center were alwayes the sittest place for a luminous body, God would have commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to set the candlesticke with the lamps in the midst of the tabernacle, and not in the side of it: our eyes had beene placed in our navels, not in our heads. And albeit <hi>Plato</hi> say, that the soule of the world resides in the innermost place of it, yet I hope you doe not by this understand the sunne; and you did well to alledge <hi>Macrobius</hi> against your selfe, in comparing the sunne in the world, to the heart in a living creature; for as the heart is not in the center of the body, neither is the sun in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49171:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the world. But you give us a profound reason why in living creatures the chiefest part is not alwayes placed in the midst, <hi>because they are not of an orbicular forme as the world is</hi>; then it seems that the outward figure is the cause why the best part is not placed in the midst. What thinke you of a Hedge hog when he wraps himselfe up in his prickles as round as a bowle, is the best part then more in the middle of his body then it was before? Or hath the earth which is of a round forme better things in the center then in the superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? What difference is there betweene the middle and out-side of a round stone? Againe, you say, the center is not the worst place, although <hi>Aristotle</hi> proves it from the dignity of the thing contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over that which is contained; and your reason is, <hi>That though the center be contained, yet it is one of the</hi> termini <hi>or limits of a round bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as well as the circumference:</hi> but I reply, that though it be one of the limits, yet it is contained, and therefore more ignoble then that which containeth it; so you have but offered to answer this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and indeed you know not how to answer it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>If we suppose the sunne to be in the center</hi> (say you) <hi>we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an excellent harmony, both in the number and distance of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</hi> For my part I give you leave to conceive what you will, so that you doe not obtrude your conceits on us as oracles, but will keep them to your selfe; if you continue to divulge them, we will conceit that your conceits are but idle phansies, if you cannot set them forth with better proofes then as yet you have done. We are confident the earth is in the center, and doe conceive that there is an excellent harmony in the Planets, though the sunne be not in the center; and therefore to say that the harmony would be disturbed if the sunne were amongst the planets, you wrong both <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> your master, whose conceit of the musicall harmony in heaven was grounded on the motion of the Planets; and injurious to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> himselfe the author of musicall harmony, and the continuall companion of the Muses, without whom there can be no consort.</p>

                  <hi>THe chiefe businesse of this Chapter</hi> (you say) <hi>is to desend the earths diurnall motion.</hi> Indeed you are too busie; <hi>Non amo nimium di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentes</hi>: neither is this businesse of yours anything else then idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>otiosi negotium.</hi> And because you cannot answer our objections, you are as busie here as you can be to illude them, and to delude the world with your great brags &amp; Rhodomontado's; but let us see with what dexterity you dissipate the strength of our arguments; you doe as <hi>Cacus</hi> did to <hi>Hercules, Cacus</hi> being too weake to resist that invincible champion, laboured to escape his hands by dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the cave, and <hi>Hercules</hi> his eyes with smoake and ashes which hee belched out against him: the like stratagem you use with intricate words and smoakie phrases to darken the understanding of the Reader.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We objected, that if the earth did move we should perceive it; you answer (but in many intricate and ambiguous tearms which were tedious to relate) <hi>That the sight judges of motion deceitfully; your reason is, because motion is not the proper object of the sight, nor belonging to any other peculiar sense: and that the common sense apprehends the eye it selfe to rest immoveable, as when a man is carried in a ship. Ans</hi> The sight is oftentimes deceived, either in respect of the distance of the object, so the stars appeare lesse then they are; or in respect of the agitation of the object, so a square thing seemes round being swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned about. 2. In respect of the indisposition of the medium, and so the Planets rising and falling seeme biggest, the aire being thickned. 3. In respect of the organ, when the eye, optick nerves, or visive spirits are disturbed, vitiated, indisposed, or agitated, and so things that rest seeme to move, because the eye moveth; for that apparent motion is not the object of the eye, as a true motion is,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49171:42"/>
but as it were the effect of the eye moved. So then, tell us the cause why we cannot perceive the earth move, seeing it moves with such a stupendious swiftnesse? You cannot say that the distance of it, nor the indisposition of the medium are the causes; the eye then must be the cause. But are all mens eyes from the creation till now so disturbed, or agitate with an insensible motion, that they cannot perceive the earth nor any part of it to move, and yet doe perceive the sunne to move? What? will you make God so defective in his work of mans body, as to give him such eyes which shal continually delude him; neither shall they ever apprehend their object, though never so neere; or the medium, though never so well disposed? Or will you make him so envious, as to give us such eyes, by which we should receive the knowledge of visible objects, and yet cannot see them when they are so neere us? This is the curse of the Sodomites, who could not see <hi>Lot's</hi> dore though they were close by it. Your si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile of the ship will not hold; for though it be true that the shore apparently moves when the ship removes, yet we see and feele the true motion of the ship, as well as we see, or rather seeme to see the apparent motion of the shore. When I have beene in a ship, I have observed by looking on the mast how swiftly it is moved from the shore; but being on the shore, and looking upon trees, I see no other motion in them then what is caused by the winde. When I am in a ship, I perceive the motion of the other ship that saileth by me, though the motion of both be equall and uniforme: but when I am in an Island, I can neither perceive the motion of it, nor the motion of the other Island that is by it. And although the motion of the eye makes a thing seeme to move which doth not move, yet it doth not make the thing seeme to move which doth really move, if it be within distance: for being in a ship I have discerned the running of horses and carts upon the shore really, though the shore it selfe moved apparently; therefore, though I should yeeld that the earth did move, yet that motion could not make me thinke that the sun did not move really, no more then the motion of the ship can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me from discerning the true motion of a horse or wheele on the shore; and albeit, motion be not the proper object of the eye, yet it is an object; neither is the eye more deceived in apprehending or receiving the species of motion, then it is in receiving the species of colours, <hi>caeteris paribus:</hi> the action of the eye, or passion which you will, being no other towards the motion of a coloured object, then towards the colour of a moving object. Againe, it would be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49171:43"/>
considered, whether the naturall motion of the earth (as you call it) and the violent motion of a ship produce the same effect in our eye; as because the moving of a ship makes the shore seeme to move, therefore the moving of the earth makes the sunne seeme to move.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Your words seeme to be contradictory when you say, <hi>That motion is not the proper object of the sight, nor belonging to any other pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar sense.</hi> We say that colours are the proper object of the sight, because they belong not to any other peculiar sense, and that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not the proper object of the eye, because it doth belong to other peculiar senses: but your other words are false, when you say, <hi>That the common sense apprehends the eye it selfe to rest immoveable.</hi> For when the eye is moved, the common sense apprehends it to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and so when it rests, the common sense apprehends it to rest; otherwise, it and the imagination should be still deceived. But when you say, <hi>That the eye is an ill judge of naturall secrets,</hi> you should have said, That it is no judge of naturall secrets; for the visible workes of nature are no secrets; natures secrets are invisible, and therefore are judged by reason, not by sense. Now, though this be a good consequence, the earth doth not move, because it doth not appeare so to us, yet this consequence will not hold, the earth doth move, because it appeares to move: for an object that is immoveable may seeme to move, because the eye is moved; but when we see a great body neere us, (to stand still, wee justly inferre that it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not, because we see it not. For the apparent motion of the shore, there is a manifest cause, but for the apparent rest of the earth there can be no cause; for if it did move it would not seem to rest, being there is no cause, not so much as imaginable of this supposed rest, but rather the contrary; for if it did move, it and all things else would seeme to move: as for the apparent bignesse of the sunne and moone, I have already told you a reason, but you have not, nor can you tell mee a reason for the apparent rest of the earth.</p>

I objected, That if the motions of the heavens be onely appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that then the motion of the clouds would be so too: your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is, <hi>That I might as well inferre, that the sense is mistaken in every thing, because it is so in one thing. Answ.</hi> You should have rather inferred, that as the sense is mistaken in one thing, so it might be in any other thing; but I will stand to your illation, the sense is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken sometimes in every thing, when it is mistaken in one thing of the same kinde: the eye is mistaken in the bignesse of one star,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49171:43"/>
and so it is in the bignesse of every star, because the reason or cause of the mistake is alike in all, to wit, the distance. The eye is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in the motion of one tree or house upon the shore, and so it is in all the trees and houses it seeth on the shore; for the reason of this mistake is alike in all, to wit, the agitation of the eye: even so if the heavens move apparently, the clouds also move apparently; <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Nam in horum motu potest decipi visus, non minus quam in motu coelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum:</hi> these are my words which you cunningly left out. The eye is deceivable in the one as well as in the other, therefore, my eye being alike disposed (in respect of its agitation, by the supposed motion of the earth) to the heavens, and to the clouds, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that as it is mistaken in the one, so it is in the other; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently wee must no more trust our eyes in the motion of the clouds, then in the motion of the heavens, if the earth did move. Therefore, what you speake of <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> his opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the blacknesse of the snow, is fit for your selfe: for to hold the snow to be blacke, and the earth to move, are both alike absurd and ridiculous; but this opinion is more dangerous then that. As for your conceit of the common sense, conceiving the eye to be immoveable, I have said already that it is false, and indeed the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of one that seems to want common sense; and as boldly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proofe doe you affirme, that the clouds, though they seeme not to move, are carried about with our earth by a swift revolution; for so you make the inferiour bodies against that order that God hath placed in the world, to move the superiour: as if you should say, The foot originally moves the head, and not the head the foot. <hi>But this is no hinderance</hi> (you say) <hi>why we may not judge aright of the other particular motions.</hi> It is true, I judge aright of the particular motions of the clouds, when I see them carried to and fro by the winde, and so I judge aright of the motion of the sunne; but when I see the sun and a cloud moving from East to West, and you should tell me that the sunne doth not move, though the cloud doth move, I would know the reason why my eye should be more deluded in the one then in the other; seeing the motion of the earth, and so of my eye, is alike disposed to both. It is as much as if you would tel me, when I see a horse and a man run both on the shore, that the man runs, but not the horse, whereas my eye is alike disposed to both. <hi>As for your similies of a man walking in the ship, and of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the oares, they will not hold:</hi> for it is true, that though the banks seeme to move, yet it will not follow that my friend doth but seem
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49171:44"/>
to walke, or the oares seeme to move, when as they move truely; the reason is, because the motion of the ship is no hinderance to the sight of that motion of my friend, or of the oares, being so neer to my eye; although that same motion of the ship is a hinderance both to the sight of the earths stability, as also of the motion of such things as be afar off: for a horse a great way off on the shore run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, will seeme to me a bush moving with the trees and bankes; even so the motion of the earth may as well delude my eye in the moving of the clouds, as of the sunne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I said that the eye could not be still deceived in its sight or judgement of a lucid body, which is its prime and proper object; Your answer is, <hi>That the deceipt is not concerning the light or colour of these bodies, but concerning their motion, which is neither the primary nor proper object of the eye. Answ.</hi> The motion of the sunne as you take it, is no wayes the object of the eye; for it is <hi>non ens</hi> in your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: What is apparent, is not, <hi>quod videtur non est</hi>; a seeming mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no motion, and therefore no object. 2. I said that a lucid body was the eyes object, the light it selfe, <hi>objectum quo,</hi> or the cause that bodies are discernable by the eye: now what probability is there, that the eyes which were made to looke upon these lucid bodies, should be still deluded, or can be, seeing their motion is rather the object of the eye, then their light, as is said? albeit moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be a common object, I see their motion, I see their lucid bodies, but their light I see not properly: their light is the cause or meanes by which, but not the <hi>objectum quod,</hi> or thing that I see.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We say that our high buildings would be hurled down if the earth did move: You answer, <hi>That this motion is naturall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore regular, and tending to conservation. Answ.</hi> Earth-quakes are naturall motions, which neither are regular, nor tend to conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the motion of windes, haile, raine, thunder, &amp;c. are naturall, and yet doe much hurt; therefore, the naturality of the earths mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot preserve our buildings from falling. But you say, <hi>If a glasse of beere may stand firmely in a ship, moving swiftly, much lesse will the naturall and equall motion of the earth cause any danger in our buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. Answ.</hi> There is no proportion betweene a glasse of beer and a high building, nor is there between the motion of a ship and of the earth; for the ship moves upon the plaine superficies of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being carried by the winde or tide: the earth moves circularly and with an incredible celerity, as your side say. You should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the earths motion, to the motion of a wheele or great globe,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49171:44"/>
and then set your glasse of beer upon it whilst it is whirling about: but you need not feare the fall of your high buildings though the heaven whirle about, except you meane to build castles in the aire, or to raise your house as high as the tower of Babell; I thinke your buildings in the moone cannot stand upon such a whirling foundation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I perceive by your Interjection <hi>ha, ha, he,</hi> that you are a merry gentleman, indeed you cannot answer for laughing; but, <hi>Per re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum multum, &amp;c.</hi> I doubt me you are troubled with a hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacke melancholy, or with the spirit of blinde <hi>Democritus</hi>: take heed of <hi>risus Sardonius.</hi> But let us see what it is that tickles you. I had said, that though this circular motion of the earth were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to it, yet it was not naturall to townes and buildings, for these are artificiall: To this you answer not but by your interjection of laughter, which is a very easie way to solve arguments, and so fooles will prove the best disputants. I hope you doe not thinke that townes and buildings are naturall bodies, or that the motion of the earth is naturall to them; and if you thinke that artificiall things are priviledged from falling, by the naturall motion of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall foundation, you speake against reason and experience; for a ship is not priviledged from sinking, because the foundation on which it is carried moves naturally; and high buildings must needs be weakned by motion, let it be never so equall and regular; hee that thinkes otherwise deserves to be laughed at. I have read of moving Islands, but without buildings, you were best goe build there.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I said, that the aire could never be quiet about us, but that there would be a continuall and forcible motion of it from East to West, if the earth did move with that celerity you speak of; to this you answer, <hi>That the aire is carried along with the same motion of the earth:</hi> But this will not help you, for the carrying of the aire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with the earth, cannot hinder the forcible motion of it, nor can we be so senselesse as not to feele it. Doth not the whirling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout of a great wheele move the aire about it? and if you stood by, you should feele it. But you are very witty in your words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>If the motion of the heaven</hi> (say you) <hi>which is a smooth body be able to carry with it a great part of the three elements, &amp;c. much more may our earth which is a rugged body be able to turne the aire next to it.</hi> You should rather say, If the earth which is but a small, dull, low, and heavy body, can carry the aire about with it, much more may
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49171:45"/>
the heavens doe this, which are vast, agil, active, and high bodies: for we finde that the superiour bodies are more apt to work upon, and to move the inferiour, then to be moved by the inferiour: as the inferiour parts of the little world of mans body are moved by the head, so it is in the great world. Againe, the heavens in respect of their agility, activity, subtlety, come neerer to the nature of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, then the earth, which is a dull, heavy, lumpish body, not apt to be moved, much lesse to move. Is it the earth that moves the aire, or the aire that moves the earth in earth-quakes? Is it the earthy and heavy part of mans body that moves these aereall substances in the nerves, which we call animall spirits? Or are not these rather the movers of our grosse bodies? Your argument is just such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as this; if the winde or aire be able to move about the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-cocke, much more may the tower or steeple which is a rugged body move it: But that rugged bodies are more apt to move, or to be moved, then smooth bodies, I never heard before. I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the smoother the bowle is, the swifter it runneth; why did <hi>David</hi> choose five smooth stones to sling, if rugged ones were apter for motion? When you would have your maid make you some mustard, give her a rugged dish, and a rugged bullet, and tell her that these are apter for motion; she will presently entertain this new Philosophie with your interjection, <hi>ha ha he:</hi> so when you say that a rugged body carrieth more aire with it then a smooth; you meant perhaps the bodies of Satyrs, or of the wilde Irish in their rugges. But now distrusting your rugged conceit, you flie to the earths magneticall vertue, whereby it can make all things neer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, to observe the same revolution: this is a farre fetched shift, and a strange property of the <hi>magnes</hi>; did you ever know a load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone move any thing except iron or steele, or to move it selfe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, and to make all things neere to it, to observe the same revolution; that these conceits are,

I said,<note place="margin">L. 1. <hi>Sec.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5</note> That when the man or subject, the medium, and the object were all moved, the sight was hindered that the eye could not exactly judge of any thing. You answer, <hi>That it's true where be seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall motions, but when the subject, medium, and object, are all carried with the same equall motion, there is no impediment in the act of sieing.</hi> But this is a meere shift of yours; for though the motion be equall in all, yet the sight will be hindered.

on your nose, and let me turne you about, the motion shall be equall in all three, but I doubt me you will read ill-favouredly your instance of reading in a ship is nothing; for the ship moves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so slowly that it is scarce discernable: but let a ship or coach move swiftly, and you shall not read distinctly. If a ship should move foure miles in a minute as you say the earth doth, you should scarce see the booke in which you read, much lesse the letters.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I said out of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> That one simple body had but one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall motion, as the earth to descend, the aire to ascend, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not have a circular motion. You answer, <hi>That these right motions belong onely to parts of the elements, and that too when they are out of their proper places.</hi> Indeed you shew your selfe a weake Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, for from whence have the parts of the earth their motion of descent, but from the whole? Doe you not know that old and triviall maxime: <hi>Propter quod unumquodque est tale, illud ipsum est magis tale?</hi> If your hand be heavy, much more heavy is your whole body; if a part of the sea be salt, much more salt is the whole. 2. When you say that the elements have these motions, onely when they are out of their owne places; if you meane of the act of ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and descending, you say true; but if you meane of the power or naturall possibility, you are deceived: for though they bee in their proper places, yet this naturall power of these motions is not taken from them. 3. When you say that a load-stone, in respect of its matter and condensity naturally tends downward; you doe againe bewray your ignorance in Philosophy, for gravity is the cause of descent, not matter and condensity; for the stars have matter and condensity, and yet they neither can, nor do descend. 4. When you say, that the load-stone which is a heavy body, and naturally tends downward, may naturally move upward, you shew your selfe more and more absurd; for besides that it is repugnant to the Maxime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove said, for a simple body to have two contrary motions, so it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturns the naturall properties of the elements: for if heavy bodies may naturally ascend, then light bodies may naturally descend; and so we shall not know how one element differs essentially from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and consequently the descending of fire of old upon the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and the ascending of <hi>Elias</hi> his body into heaven, were not miracles, but naturall motions. 5. That desire of union and coition which one load-stone hath with another, by which it breaks the laws of Nature, is but your conceit: if one load-stone draw another, or if it draw yron upward, that ascent is no naturall motion, but in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49171:46"/>
some sort is a violent attraction: therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Maxime re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines firme, that one simple body hath but one naturall motion, and consequently the earth doth not naturally moved round.</p>
               <p n="9">9. We hold, that the gravity and magnitude of the Earth makes it unfit for so swift a motion. Your answer is, <hi>That heavinesse can onely be applied to those bodies which are out of their proper places, or to such parts as are severed from the whole.</hi> To this wee have partly answered already, that the essentiall properties of simple bodies are in the whole principally, and in the parts by reason of the whole. 2. It is false that heavy bodies are not heavy in their proper places; for they lose not their essentiall qualities by being in their places. Is a mill-stone lesse heavy when it is on or in the ground, then when it is raised from the ground? Put to your hand, and trie if you can with more ease wagge it upon the ground, then when it is raised some paces above it. 3. When you say, <hi>That the globe of the Earth in its right place cannot truly be called heavy</hi>: I say the contrary, that it can never be more truly called heavy, then when it is there; for if it were not heavy there, it would not be there: it is in its owne place because it is heavy, if it were possible to remove it from its place, it would never rest till it returned thither, because its heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse would not suffer it to rest in any other place but in its owne, which is the lowest place fit for so heavy a body. 4. When you say, <hi>That in it, and in the rest of the Planets there is an ineptitude to motion by reason of the matter, and condensity of their bodies</hi>; you know not what you say: For if there be no naturall apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to motion in the Planets, and in the earth, that motion must be violent or preternaturall. Why is the motion of the fire down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and of the earth upward, violent motions, but because these elements have no aptitude to such motions? 5. When you make the matter the cause of this ineptitude, you know not the grounds of naturall Philosophy; for it is the matter that gives the aptitude, as the forme gives the act. 6. You say, <hi>That Nature may endow the earth with a motive faculty, proportionable to its greatnesse, as shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes spirits upon other creatures</hi> (for instance, an Eagle and a Flie,) <hi>proportionable to their severall bodies.</hi>

There is indeed so me proportion between an Eagle and a Flie; but between an Eagle, and the vast body of the earth, there is none at all. If you had compared the motion of the Eagle, to the motion of the great bird <hi>Ruc,</hi> you had spake within compasse: If one

should say that a little wheele, and a great mill-stone may be moved according to the proportion of their bodies: so likewise may the hill <hi>Athos</hi> or <hi>Atlas</hi> be turned about, he would be counted ridiculous: and yet there is a farre greater proportion between a mill-stone and those hills, then between an Eagle and the Earth. 7. <hi>Though the magnitude of the earth make it incapable of so swift a motion, yet this doth not make the heaven much more incapable,</hi> as you say: For it is the magnitude joyned with the heavinesse of the earth, that makes it incapable of such a motion: but the heavens are not heavy, though great. A cloud which may be a mile or two about, hath a greater magnitude then a pebble small stone; and yet you see with what facility the cloud is carried, whereas the stone is not moved, (though it were high in the air) but with the motion of descent. 8. As for the swiftnesse of the earth's course, which <hi>exceeds not</hi> (you say) <hi>the celerity of clouds driven by a tempestuous winde; of a cannon bullet which in a minute flies foure miles, &amp;c.</hi> These (I say) are the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of a crasie braine in a dream: you are the onely darling and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of Nature, who both knowes the Earth's motion, and how much it can runne in a minute. It seemes this incredible swiftnesse of the earth hath made your head giddy, that you know not what you write: and how can it be otherwise? for if you be carried 240. miles in an houre, and your pen whilst it is forming almost every letter foure miles in a minute, your braines flie as fast as the bullet out of the cannon: If this be true, I doe not think that either you know what you write, or where you are, nay you could not write at all; nor were it possible for you to live, or for your lungs and heart to move, or draw breath.</p>
               <p>Your subsequent discourse of the Earths magneticall property is grounded (as indeed all your Book) upon ridiculous suppositions; and on such grounds do you raise the structure of your Babel or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. 1. <hi>You suppose that the lower parts of the Earth do not consist of such a soft fructifying soyl as in the surface, because there is no use for it.</hi> But what if I should suppose the contrary, that it doth consist of a fructifying soyle, and that there be people there, aswell as in your Moone? I doubt not but I could prove it with as good reasons as you do your world in the Moon. 2. <hi>You suppose it consists of a hard rock is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, because these lower parts are pressed close together by the weight of the heavy bodies above them.</hi> What if I should suppose the contrary, that the softest ground is in the lowest parts, as being farthest from the Sun which hardneth the earth; therefore they that dig deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49171:47"/>
to the bowells of the earth, finde it still softer and softer the deeper they goe: And wee know that many fruits and heavy bodies are hard and stonie without, but soft within; the earth then is not like a cheese that by pressing groweth hard. 3. <hi>You suppose that this rockie substance is a load-stone.</hi> But what if I should suppose it to be a diamond, which is more likely; both because it is the more precious stone, and Nature commonly layeth up the most precious things within her most inward parts; and because it is harder, for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your doctrine, the pressing close of heavy bodies is the cause of hardnesse. 4. <hi>It's probable</hi> (you say) <hi>that this rockie substance is a load-stone, because the earth and load-stone agree in so many properties.</hi> What if I should say that they disagree in many more properties, and that therefore this cannot be the load-stone? But what an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is this? the earth and loadstone agree in many properties, therefore the lower part of the earth consists of load-stones: as if you would say, A man and an horse agree in many properties, therefore the lower part of a man consists, or is made up of a horse: or thus, The elementary and our culinary fire agree in many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, therefore the inmost or lower part of the one consists of the other. 5. You say well that what hath all the properties of the load-stone, must needs be of that nature; but because you are not well read in the Master of syllogismes you inferre that the inward parts of the earth consist of a magneticall substance, which is the conclusion without an assumption, which should have been this: but the lower parts of the earth have all the properties of the load-stone, which wee deny. Now let us heare how you prove it; <hi>The difference</hi> (you say) <hi>of declination and variation in the mariners needle cannot proceed from it selfe, being the same every where; nor from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, for then the variation would not be still alike in the same place, but divers according to the severall parts of heaven, which at severall times happen to be over it; therefore it proceeds from the earth, which being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with magneticall affections, diversly disposeth the motions of the needle.</hi> I answer, the Earth may have a disponent vertue to alter the needle, and yet not be a load-stone; so the heavens are the causes of generation, corruption, alterations, &amp;c. in the world, and yet they are not capable of these qualities: the Moon causeth the sea to ebbe and flow, doth shee therefore partake of the like affections? or hath shee the properties of the sea? The load-stone disposeth the motions of the yron, will you therefore inferre that the load-stone hath the properties of yron? 2. If the variation, as you say,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49171:47"/>
of the needle be divers, according to the severall parts of heaven passing over it; it must follow, that the needle must vary every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute and scruple of an houre, even here where we live; seeing every scruple or minute divers parts of the heaven are still passing over it. 3. If the Inclination or motion of the needle towards the North, is caused by the heaven, not by the earth; why should not the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and declination of it be caused by the heaven likewise?</p>
               <p>You are driven to hard shifts, when you are forced to flie to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes for want of proofs, to strengthen your weak and absurd assertions; for similitudes may illustrate, they cannot prove. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you cannot shew any similitude of the earth's motion with such things as you are acquainted, you are forced to borrow simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes from those things with which you are not acquainted, rather then you will seeme to say nothing. You flie beyond the Moon, <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> must serve you at a dead life, but I know not upon what acquaintance. This is your conceit: A bullet, or any part of the earth, being severed from the whole, observes no lesse the same motions, then if they were united to the whole: whereas <hi>Jupiter, Saturne,</hi> &amp;c. doe constantly and regularly move on in their courses, hanging in the etheriall aire. But first tell us if <hi>Iupiter</hi> and the rest are separated from the whole; if they be, what is it that moves them with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie motions? If they be not, then your simile hath never a foot. Againe, doth this follow: <hi>Iupiter, Saturne,</hi> &amp;c. have such and such motions; therefore bullets and parts of the earth being separated, observe the motion of the whole? You had been better to have brought your simile from the sea, which is neerer to the earth in place and nature then the heavens are; thus: The sea ebbs and flowes, therefore parts of the earth being separated, may observe the motion of the whole. Doth not this hang well together like a rope of sand? If you had told us that parts of the sea being sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, observe the motion of the whole in ebbing and flowing; therefore parts of the earth separated, observe also the motion of the whole, you had said something; but you know the contrary of the Antecedent to be true; for you tell us that a bucket of sea wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth not ebbe and flow, though this motion be (as you said) naturall to the sea: But here you are deceived; for if this motion were a naturall property flowing from the essence of the sea, the whole sea, and every part of it should ebbe and flow; but it is not so, for the Adriatick sea hath this motion; the Tyrrhene, Baltick, and some other seas have it not; so some parts of the sea ebbe and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49171:48"/>
flow more and longer then others; but essentiall properties are not capable of more and lesse; some thinke that this is no pure motion, but an alteration rather in the sea: but be it what it will be, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth not from the nature of the sea, but from externall causes; partly from the force and motion of the stars, chiefly of the moon; and partly from vapours and exhalations in the sea.</p>
               <p n="12">12. You say, <hi>The whole earth may moveround, though the severall parts thereof have no such revolution particular of their stone; for there be many things agreeing to the whole frame, which are not discernable in the divers parts of it, which you instance in the sea water, and in the bloud and humours of our body, which ascend in the body, but descend, being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from it. Answ.</hi> There is nothing proper and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to the whole, but is also proper and essentiall to the parts separated or not separated; thus if circular motions were naturall to the whole earth as you say, the parts of it would retaine their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture still though separated: therefore every part of the earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends, because the whole doth, but no part thereof moves circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, because the whole doth not. As for the parts of the sea wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a bucket, there is not ebbing and flowing as in the whole; because that motion is not naturall to it, nor doth it proceed from the active forme, but from its passive, whereby it is apt to receive such a motion from externall agents: that motion which is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and naturall to it, is not lost in the parts, being separated; for every bucket, yea, every drop of sea water descends, because that motion is naturall, therefore not separable. As for the bloud and humours in our body, which you say ascend naturally to the head, I say, they ascend not naturally, for naturally they descend, because heavy; but they are carried upward by the spirits in them, and drawne up by the attractive faculty, for each part drawes its ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: now this bloud and humours being separated from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, lose their heate and spirits, and so descend. Your instances then will not evert our maxime, to wit, that if the whole earth move circularly, the separated parts would retaine the same moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but you say that this motion is not discernable in the parts; I grant it, neither is it discernable in the whole; and seeing it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discernable by the sense, nor demonstrable by reason, how come you to know it? if you can perceive in the swift violent course of a bullet, the magneticall revolution of the whole earth, you are more quick-sighted then <hi>Lynx.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have certaine phrases like riddles, which stand in need of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49171:48"/>
some <hi>Oedipus</hi> to explaine them. 1. <hi>You call the earth a great magnet</hi>; What's that? A great load-stone? If there be great store of iron in your moone world, this great magnet in time may draw down the moone upon us. 2. You say, <hi>That parts of the earth may according to their matter be severed from the whole:</hi> perhaps you meane they may be severed in respect of place, not of matter; for if they have not the same matter with the whole, they cannot be parts, nor can they be the subject of these common magneticall qualities you speak of. 3. You say, <hi>That Iupiter and Saturn hang in the etheriall aire:</hi> you love to confound what our wise fore-fathers have distinguished, because you have an etheriall earth in the moon, you would fain have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theriall aire to: God hath separated the heaven or etheriall region from this aereall, so must we. I have read once of <hi>aura aetherea</hi> in <hi>Virgil,</hi> but there the Poet divinely meanes our breath which wee have originally from heaven; I know no other etheriall aire but this. 4. You say, <hi>That the flesh, bones, &amp;c. tend downeward as being of a condensate matter</hi>: but gravity is the proper cause of descent, and not density; for the fire and aire may be condensate, and yet tend upward. 5. You say, <hi>That Saturne, Iupiter, and the Sunne, are mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall bodies:</hi> If you meane that these stars have the essentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the <hi>magnes</hi> to draw iron, then you wil make the earth and Planets to be of the same kind and species: if <hi>Mahomeis</hi> iron chest were hanged between the sun and the earth, it's a question whether it should be drawne more forcibly upward or downeward. 6. You aske a reason, <hi>Why the earth should not move about its center as the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets doe:</hi> I may rather aske you why it should, seeing it was made for rest, and they for motion; neither is there any thing wherein they agree, but that they are corporeall substances, in all things else they differ: why then should wee inferre the earths motion from their motion? 7. You that prove nothing, but boldly sayes any thing, as if men were bound to receive your dictates though never so unreasonable and ridiculous, as if they were oracles; you I say tell us, <hi>Of spots about the sun, thought to be clouds or evaporations from his body:</hi> If your eagle eyes can see spots about the sun, then the heavens are not pure in your sight; but who hath spotted them which God hath made cleare and pure without spot or wrinkle? are not the spots in your glasse, or in your eye rather? I have heard of one who with his spectacles, reading in a booke, beat the booke three or foure times, thinking he had seen a flye on the paper, when it was a spot in his glasse. If you had read the absurd opinion of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49171:49"/>
the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who held with as great confidence as you doe your conceits, That the sunne was a great ship sailing about the world: perhaps you would have told us, that these spots are great whales playing about the sides of the ship; and we should as soone beleeve you in this as in the other: but now you cannot certainly tell us, <hi>Whether these spots may not be clouds or evaporations from the body of the sunne.</hi> But I would know what use is there for clouds there; except it be to shadow now and then, and to refresh with raine your world in the moon: and if there be any such watry meteors about the sun, they must needs be extracted out of the sea, lakes, and rivers, that are in your upper world. And seeing these vapours cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densate into clouds without cold, it confirmes my opinion, that the sun is not hot formally; and that the heaven was nick-named when it was called <hi>aether, ab ardore:</hi> but I much muse what these evaporations should be from the body of the sun? What, doth the sun pant and sweat with his daily labour? Evaporations are hot and moist exhalations, is there any moisture in the sunne? Doe not these clouds and evaporations proceed rather from his horses no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils? But the prince of Poets tels us that they blow light out of their nostrils;

thus you afford us matter of sport.</p>
               <p>But you goe on in your absurdities; for having once plunged your selfe in this mire, the more you strive and struggle to get out, the faster you sticke, and the deeper you sinke in. You tell us, <hi>That the moone is turned about by our earth:</hi> why doe you not tell us also that the sunne is turned about by the moone, and the firmament by the sunne, and the <hi>primum mobile</hi> by the firmament, and the first mover by the <hi>primum mobile?</hi> and so the world shall be turned topsie turvie. For is not any of these turnings as probable as the moon to be turned about by the earth? perswade me this, and then you shall easily assure me that the cart drawes the horse, the crab courses the hare, and the ship turns about the wind? You would make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of heaven like many disordered common-wealths here on earth, where the inferiour and meaner sort of people will take upon them to rule and guide their superiors, Princes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and then all comes to confusion; the horses run away with the coach and coach-man:

Is it not reasonable that the inferiour bodies should receive their motion from the superiour, as they have from them their beauty, perfection, and conservation?</p>
               <p>But you give the moone many turners; <hi>The earth by her magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall motion; Iupiter (who turnes the foure lesser Planets) by his body; the Sun by his revolution.</hi> So here be three severall wayes of turning; motion, body, and revolution: but is not revolution, motion? And when <hi>Iupiter</hi> turnes by his body, is there no revolution? Or when the Sunne turnes by his revolution, doth he not turne by his body? It seemes that he that turneth by his body, toucheth, and so <hi>Iupiter</hi> toucheth the lesser Planets. He touched indeed <hi>Venus</hi> in the Poet when he kissed her:
<q>

But how he toucheth and turneth these Planets by his body, you doe not instruct us; but your drift in all this, is to shew that if the Sunne carry about his spots or clouds; the earth carry about the Moone, &amp;c. much more may the earth carrie about an arrow or bullet: as if you would say, If the water carrie about the mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheel, and the wheele carrie about the mill-stones, much more may the mill carrie about the miller and his horse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning other mens observations of the flame of a candle carried equally in a ship; of an equall force, casting an heavy body but at an equall distance with &amp; against the motion of the ship; of a heavy body in a ship fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down in a straight line; of a man leaping up in a ship, and abiding in the aire, one second scruple of an houre, and yet the ship not withdraw it selfe fifteene foot:</hi> Of these I will say but little, because I have already said something of them elsewhere;<note place="margin">De teros mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu L. 1. c. 3. 4, 5, &amp;c.</note> yet I must tell you, that though the smoake and flame of a candle within the ship are carried with the ship, it will not follow that the clouds which are without the earth are turned about by the earth. If you could thrust the clouds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bowels of the earth, they should be carried about with the earth if it did move; but take the same candle which you talke, and place it in a calme night on the top of the mast, when the ship is carried with the tyde, then you shall see that though the candle is carried along with the ship, yet the smoake being separated from the candle doth not follow the ship, but remaines mounting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the aire. If the ship then carrie not along with it the smoak of the candle which is in it, how shall we thinke that the earth can carrie about the clouds which are so farre above it? Now to salve this, you tell us, <hi>That the aire is as well limited in bounds, as that which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49171:50"/>
is included in a roome.</hi> But then I answer, that it is one thing to be included, and another thing to be limited; every thing that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in a roome is limited, but not every thing limited is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; what is included must needs partake of the motion of that which includes it: the aire within the ship is moved by and with the ship, because it is included; but the aire without the ship though it be limited, yet moves not by or with the ship because it is not included.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You ask where the bounds of the air are terminated, and you answer your selfe by the spheare of vaporous aire; or which is all one, by the orbe of magneticall vigour; so you distinguish between the aire, and vaporous aire:</hi> but you tell us not how farre this spheare of vaporous aire, or this orbe of magneticall vigour reacheth; so that wee are not satisfied with your answer, except you meane that it reacheth to the moon; for you told us before that the moon is turned about by the earth, but then you contradict your selfe, for you say here, that these bounds are not terminated by the concavity of the moone's orbe; so where to finde you, and the bounds of your spheare of vaporous aire, I cannot tell; neither doe I understand how vaporous aire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a substance, can be all one with magneticall vigour which is an accident: and how this accident can have its orbe, this is a new piece of Philosophie which would be illustrated, and so doe the words following; <hi>That all earthly bodies are contained within these limits, as things are in a close roome, and as parts in that whole to which they belong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though a heavy by equall force be cast at an equall distance, whether it move with or against the motion of the ship, yet will it not follow that a bullet being shot towards East or West shall passe the same distance; for though you cast your bullet against the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ship, it is not hindered nor furthered by its motion: so if the earth did move, that motion were no more to the bullets mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then if it stood still; but it is the motion of the aire that furthers or hinders the bullets motion, whether in the ship, or out of it. The earth then turning about the aire with great violence from East to West, must hinder the motion of the bullet or arrow flying to the East, and further that which cometh from the East; but it is not so in a ship, for the ship doth not carry the aire before it, but divides the aire whilst it moves, so that the aire gives place, as the water also doth to the ship, that there may not be penetration of dimensions. How then can the bullets motion be hindered or furthered
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49171:50"/>
by the motion of the ship, seeing the aire in which it moveth, is neither with it, nor against it? Of the winde here I doe not speake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You grant that in a ship under saile, a stone being let fall from the mast will not descend to the same point, as if the ship stood still; but you say, the motion of a ship is accidentall, and it is otherwise in these motions that are supposed to be naturall.</hi> I have shewed against <hi>Lansbergius,</hi> that there is no naturall motion in the earth, but though there were, what's that to the furtherance or hinderance of the stones motion to the same point; suppose that not nature but an Angel turned about the earth, the motion notwithstanding is circular, be the mover what it will be, externall or internall, Nature or Angel: therefore, it is true still, that as the stone falling from the mast will not descend to the same point when the ship saileth, as if it stood still; so likewise a stone falling from an high tower, will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend perpendicularly to the same point, the earth moving, as it would doe, if it stood still. Now, <hi>how farre the ship will withdraw it selfe in its greatest swiftnesse, from him that leaps up and stayes in the aire a second scruple of an houre:</hi> and how far the earth in that space will goe from him in that certaine, neither is it materiall; it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that it will remove a certaine space, and that he shall not fall upon the same place from which he leaped up.</p>
               <p>What you granted but now you recall, and tell us of <hi>Galilaus, That the stone would still descend unto the very same place, whether the ship moved or not.</hi> So farre I yeeld, that if a heavy stone be let fall from a short mast whilest the ship moveth slowly, it is scarce discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that the stone hath fallen or varied any thing from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular line: but if a small stone be let fall from a high mast whilest the ship moveth swiftly, then it is plaine to any man that hath sense, that the stone doth not fall upon the same point on which it would have fallen, if the ship had stood still. Now to say that the motion of the ship is impressed in the stone, is a toy; for how can one body impresse a motion in the other whilest they are separated, as the stone and ship are before it fall? of magneticall bodies I speake not.</p>
               <p>Being weary a ship-board you come on shore, and so having taken horse, you put spurs to his sides, and in your full cariere, you let a bullet drop out of your hand, which you say, <hi>Hath a transverse motion, besides the motion of the descent.</hi> But how should it have the transverse motion of the horse, seeing the hand doth but
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49171:51"/>
unfold it selfe to let it fall; the arme indeed is carried by the swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the horse, and so is the bullet whilest it is in the hand, but being let fall, how can it have a transverse motion, seeing the hand did not expresse any such motion in it? for to let fall is not to give a transverse motion: and though you would make it all one to cast a thing from us, and to let drop a thing when we are on horseback, yet the contrary of this is so cleare, that any man may see it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of spectacles. And sure if there were any transverse motion in the descent of the bullet, it is rather to be ascribed to the motion of the aire, then to the opening of the hand; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is but a crotchet, as likewise your conceit of a bullet shot out of a cannon set on end; you spend your powder, and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and paper too, to no purpose; for you shall never perswade me (for all your two printed canons) that the bullet shot out and being in the aire can partake of the earths circular motion, till first you prove that the earth doth move, and then bring me better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons then as yet you have done, for the circular motion of the bullet in the aire; it is not the picture (which is the expression of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and idea only) that can evince my understanding, when sense and reason are on my fide; for what may not men set forth in pictures; Chimaera's, Centaures, Gorgons, &amp;c. and what not? <hi>Pictoribus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Poetis,</hi>— you know what followes.</p>
               <p>Now you goe a birding; for what is a gentleman but his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? and you discharge your peece with that dexterity that you hit the poore bird flying, as surely as if he were sitting upon a tree: and what followes upon this? Namely, <hi>That the motion of the piece as in aiming it is made to follow the bird in its flight, is communicated to the bullet in the aire.</hi> But I see that though you have killed the bird, yet you are no good birder; for at the instant whilst the peece is discharged, it is held steadie, so there is no motion of the peece im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to the bullet in the aire; but though the peece did move, will it follow therefore that the earth turnes about bullets in the aire? if your powder and shot be not better then your arguments, you'l never kill birds.</p>
               <p>But what a monstrous absurdity doe you tell us, <hi>That if a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent winde be able to drive ships, throw downe towers, turne up trees, much more may the diurnall motion of the aire (which doth so farre exceed in swiftnesse the most tempestuous winde) be able to carry with it the bodies of birds</hi>? If the diurnall motion of the aire exceed the windes in impetuositie, how comes it, that it doth not the same effects that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49171:51"/>
the winde doth? why doe we not feele its force? surely, if the aire did move with that violence from East to West, that a tempestuous winde doth, we should never have any ships come from the West Eastward; nor ships bound Westward should stay for a winde, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motion of the aire at all times would carrie them with a witnesse. If we should have occasion to saile to New England, wee should be there quickly, but no hopes ever to returne thence; how should we be able to walke or sit on horsebacke, travelling against the motion of the aire, if it did move with that violence you speak of? much lesse could birds in their flight resist such a force; not the great bird Ruck (that I may fit you with a bird somewhat propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to your conceits) whose wings are twelve paces long, and snatches up elephants (as if they were but mice) in his talons a great way in the aire: sometimes you play the Painter, as in your circles and other figures; and sometimes the Poet, as here:
<q>Admiranda sanis, sed non credenda.—</q>

               <p>As for your distinction of the motion of heavie and light bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to wit, <hi>That they being considered according to the space wherein they move, their motions are not simple but mixed of a direct and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; but according to the medium wherein they move, they have properly right motions.</hi> This I say is such a riddle, that <hi>Oedipus</hi> could scarce have solved it; for why should not the motion be mixed as well in the medium as in the space? Is the aire or medium a hinderance to circular motions, so that these bodies can onely move there in a straight line? if so, you contradict your selfe, for you tell us still that bodies are moved round by the aire, and this by the earth. And how shall we understand that a stone falling downeward hath a mixed motion of a direct and circular according to the space where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it moves, but a simple straight motion according to the aire wherein it moves? What mean you by this word (<hi>space?</hi>) you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not meane the <hi>ubi</hi> of these bodies moving, for that is their rest in the place to which they move: <hi>ultima perfectio corpor is mobilis.</hi> You doe not understand I thinke the intervall of the ancients which <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath refuted, as being neither a substance nor an accident; not a substance, because there would be penetration; not an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, for so an accident should be better then the substance; for <hi>Locus est prior &amp; nobilior locato.</hi> And if by space you understand the aire, then how will your distinction stand, the aire or medium, and the space being all one? the place it cannot signifie, for the stone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth not in its place, but to it; therefore what your space is,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49171:52"/>
and how distinguished from the medium, I thinke you doe not know. If wee should aske you with what motion Christs body ascended into heaven, you will answer that according to the space wherein it moved, it ascended by a mixed motion of a direct and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but according to the medium, it ascended by a simple straight motion; and so wee shall depart from you as wise as we came, like those that consulted with <hi>Sibylla; Inconsultì ab<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You say, That <hi>Aristotle</hi> would not deny but that fire may ascend, and yet participate of a circular motion, so likewise must it be for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of any thing. <hi>Aristotle</hi> is beholding to you, for if you will beleeve him that heavie bodies must have a double motion, because he would not deny but that the fire may have a double motion; then if he would not deny but that the heavens may move round, and that the earth may stand still, you will beleeve him; much more I hope you will credit him when by irrefragable reasons hee proves the motion of the one, and immobilitie of the other: but how ever, it is bad reasoning from the possibilitie of one thing to the necessity of another; great oddes between may be, and must be; between fire and earth; because <hi>Croesus</hi> may be poore, must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Irus</hi> be rich?

               <p>If the aire did move round with the earth, it is most certaine that the comets would seem alwayes to stand still, being carried about by the revolution of this aire; but experience sheweth that they

rise and set; to this you answer, <hi>That most comets are above the spheare of the aire which is turned round with our earth. Answ.</hi> You told us before that the earth turneth about the moone, therefore it must follow that the comets are above the moone, if they be above that aire which is turned about with our earth. 2. We have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy shewed that the aire sometimes moveth the earth, but that the earth moveth the aire is false and preposterous. 3. You tell us, <hi>That those comets which are within the orbe of our aire seeme to stand still, you instance that comet mentioned by</hi> Josephus,<note place="margin">De bello Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daico. 7.<hi>c.</hi>12</note> 
                  <hi>which hung over Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.

Now when you say, <hi>That this comet being within the orbe of our aire, seemed to stand still</hi>; you are deceived, for it was Gods worke that it stood still over that place: and it did not seeme, but did truly stand still, by which it is plaine that the earth moveth not; for if it did move, then the comets which are neerest to it would move swiftest; but the contrary of this is true, for the higher the comet is, the swister it moveth, the lower, the slower; yea scarce at all; because it is the heaven that moveth the comets, and not the earth: so you falsifie<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That you might justly passe over my nine arguments which I urged in one Chapter, against your opinion; but because I proceed</hi> (say you) <hi>with such scorne and triumph, you will examine my boastings.</hi> You doe wisely, like the Romans, who that their Generals might not be puffed up with the glory of their triumphs, caused some to walke along by their chariots, using upbraiding words; the like doe you, calling my arguments cavills not worth the naming; yet you are pleased to name them, to shew doubtlesse their weaknesse, and your wit.</p>
               <p>My first cavill (as you call it) is this; If the earth move, it will be hotter then the water, because motion is the cause of heat: but that the earth should be hotter then water, is repugnant to that principall in naturall Philosophie which affirmes the earth to be colder; besides, the water would never freeze if it were moved as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49171:53"/>
swiftly as the earth. This argument because you cannot answer, you picke (as you thinke) a contradiction out of it, which is this; The earth by motion is hotter then the water, and yet the water moves along with it, which water is made warme also by motion, that it is not capable of congelation. <hi>Answ.</hi> Is this a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thinke you: the earth is hotter then the water, and yet the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is hot too; the fire is hotter then the aire, and yet the aire is hot too? who ever heard that the degrees of comparison make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction? I should not contradict my selfe, if I should say, <hi>Keplar</hi> was a cold disputant, but you are a colder. 2. Though I say that the water moveth along with the earth, yet the earth may be hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the water without any contradiction; for of two bodies moving together, one may be hotter then the other, especially, if they be of different natures; who knowes not that drie and solid bodies (such as the earth is) are more capable intensively of heate, then thin and moist bodies, such as the water is? 3. Though the earth, water, and aire next to it, be not severed one from another, yet they are made hot by such a violent motion: when you runne, your cloathes, skin, flesh, bloud, &amp;c. are not severed one from the other, and yet your motion makes them all hot. 4. If motion in fluid bodies were the cause of coldnesse (as you say some do think) then it would follow, that the more you move, your bloud should be the colder. <hi>Scaliger</hi> shewes, that they who water their horses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot, use to stirre the water violently, that it may be brought to a warme temper, that the horses may drinke without danger. 5. I deny that all running waters are the coldest, neither are they the colder because they run, but because the meet still with fresh aire: so shall you in a cold day (if you rise to walke) be colder for a while, then when you sit still; not because you walke (for that in time will warme you) but because you meet with fresh aire, vvhich you did not vvhilest you sate; neither is there yet so much heat in you as to abate the sense of the cold aire, till your motion have caused it. 6. I deny that the strongest windes are still the coldest, though they blow from the same coast at the same time of the year, for I have observed that in one <hi>February,</hi> a gentle easterly vvind hath brought snovv, and the next <hi>February</hi> a strong East vvinde hath brought raine. 7. If rest be the cause that in cold vveather vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth freeze, then all vvaters that rest vvould freeze, and no run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vvaters vvould freeze; but this is false, for some vvaters resting doe not freeze, and sometimes running vvaters doe freeze, vvhen
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49171:53"/>
the motion is not so strong as to stirre up the heat; therefore, it remaines that the heat caused by the motion, and not the motion it selfe, is the hinderance of the waters freezing. 8. If this motion were true that the earth runnes foure miles in a minute, the heat of the aire would be more then moderate; even in winter you could not indure the heat of it; we should need no fire to warme us; wood would be cheap enough.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My second argument was this: If the earth did move the aire, then the aire which is next to the earth would be purer, as being more rarified; but the contrary is true, for the higher the aire is, the purer it is. You answer never a word to this argument, which shewes you assent; <hi>Qui tacet consentire videiur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. My third argument: If the earth did move the aire, it would cause a sound, but this is no more audible then the Pythagoricall harmony of heaven. You answer, <hi>That there is no reason why this motion should cause a sound, more then the supposed motion of the heavens.</hi> But I say, there is a great deale of reason, for if any solid body, be it never so small though an arrow, bullet, or wand, moving the air, cause a sound; will not the vast body of the earth turning the aire with that violence cause a hideous noise, which would make us all deafe? now, there is no reason why the motion of the heavens should make any sound, for neither are they solid bodies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor doe they move or encounter any solid body, nor is there any aire in heaven; which things are required to make a sound.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I argued, that nature had in vaine endowed the heavens with all conditions requisite for motion, if they were not to move; for they have a round figure, they have neither gravity nor levity, they are incorruptible, and they have no contrary. This you say will prove the earth to move as well as the heavens; <hi>For that hath a round figure, it is not heavy in its proper place, and being considered as whole, the other two conditions you reject as being untrue, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to motion. Answ.</hi> Though I should grant you that the earth were round, yet it is not so exactly round and smooth as the heaven; for it hath many mountaines and vallies, and some hills higher, some lower: is a globe or boule that hath knobs and dents in it so fit for motion as that which is smooth, and equally round? 2. I have shewed already the folly of that conceit, which holdeth the whole earth not to be heavy in, its own place; as if the elements must loose their essentiall properties being in their own places, whereas it is the place that preserveth the propertiese and essenc of things.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49171:54"/>
Have the fire and aire lost their levity because they are in their own places? and is it not absurd to say (as I have already shewed) that there should be weight in a part of any thing, and not in the whole? as if a piece of an yron bullet were heavie, but not the whole bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let: you were as good say, that <hi>totum non est majus suâ parte.</hi> 3. Whereas you say that the heavens are corruptible, you may say also that they are generable; and so being subject to generation and corruption, they are of the same nature with sublunary bodies, and must have the same matter; so that as there is a transmutation of the elements into each other, even so the heavens may be changed into the elements, and these into them: heaven may become earth, and earth heaven; this is your admirable learning which passeth all understanding. 4. Heaven (it seemes by you) hath a contrary, but you tell us not what that is; they are not contrary to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as fire and water; nor are they contrary to sublunary things, for they cherish and preserve them; neither have they the same common matter. 5. Any sensible man may easily conceive, that contrariety and corruption are hinderances to a perpetuall circular motion; and because (as is said) the heaven is not capable of them, but the earth is, it will follow that I argued upon good grounds, that the heavens onely are endowed with all things requisit for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not the earth: and therefore God will have nothing idle, as hee made nothing in vaine: hee hath made the heavens, and the three superiour elements to be exercised with motion, and the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est element with generation and corruption; but it were strange if the earth should be subject to all three, and the heavens to none, but should stand still, and be perpetually idle; this is not sutable to the wisdome of the Maker.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I reasoned that all similary parts are of the same nature with the whole, but each part of the earth doth rest in its place, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the whole also. You say this Argument would prove, <hi>That the sea doth not ebbe and flow, because every drop of water hath not this motion; or that the whole earth is not sphericall, because each part hath not the same forme. Answ.</hi> I have shewed already that the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing of the sea are not essentiall to the sea, for in many places the sea doth not ebbe and flow; therefore it is no wonder, that parts of the sea, being severed from the whole, lose that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, seeing many parts being joyned with the whole have it not. This motion then is caused by externall agents; but those qualities which are essentiall to the whole, are not lost in the parts: Every
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49171:54"/>
drop of water is heavy, and moves downward, because the whole doth; every drop of sea water is salt, because the whole is. 2. I have said already that the earth is not exactly sphearicall, and though it were, your conceit is nothing: for roundnesse belongs not to the earth, <hi>quà talis,</hi> as it is earth, <hi>sed quà tota,</hi> as it is whole. When a thing ceaseth to be whole, it loseth the figure of the whole, neither are external figures or outward qualities essential to things, but common accidents onely: Now, the qualitie of resting in the lowest place is essentiall to the whole earth, therefore to the parts also.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I said that the Sun in the world is as the heart in mans body, but the motion of the heart ceasing,, none of the members stirre; so neither would there be motion in the world if the Sun stood still: <hi>This</hi> (you say) <hi>is rather an illusturation, then a proof.</hi> I grant it; for I used it as an illustration to discover with its light the weaknesse, and to dispell the darknesse of your opinion. And were it not an absurd thing to think that the arteries move, but the heart standeth still? So no lesse absurd is it to say, that the Earth moveth, but the Sunne standeth still. 2. Illustrations oftentimes are forcible proofs, and used they are both by Divines and Philosophers.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I said that the Sun and heavens work upon these inferiour bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by their light and motion. You say, <hi>That the Sun and Planets working upon the earth by their owne reall, daily motion, is the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, therefore must not be taken for a common ground. Answ.</hi> If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing shall be taken for a common ground which is or hath been in question, then there are no common grounds in Divinity and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy; for I know no fundamentall doctrine in the one, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall in the other, which hath not been questioned by wanton and unsettled spirits. 2. I said that the heavens work by motion; you inferre, as if I had said, of a reall daily motion: I spake neither of daily nor annuall motion; if hee doth not work by his daily, doth hee work by his annuall revolution? 3. Tell mee if you can, from whence proceed the many motions and mutations that are in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary things? from themselves they cannot; from a superior cause then they must, and what is that but the heavens? and what other media or meanes are in heaven by which they work, but light and motion? If you can tell us any other besides these, wee will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to you.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I proved that the earth must be firme and stable, because it is the foundation of buildings. You say, <hi>That it is firme from all jog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49171:55"/>
and uncertaine motions. Answ.</hi> This is a jogging conceit of yours, and an uncertain answer, as I have shewed already; for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is motion, is an enemy to buildings, be it never so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; and a moving foundation can be no settled foundation: If a foundation be stable, how can it move? if it move, how can it be stable?</p>
               <p n="9">9. My ninth Argument was taken from the authority of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, grounded on Scripture;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The creature is subject to vanity</hi>; this is the vanity of motion of which <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks: <hi>The Sun riseth, and the Sun goeth downe, &amp;c. This</hi> (you say) <hi>is but a weake Argument; for it is granted that this opinion is a Paradoxe. Answ.</hi> As it devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates from the opinion of other men, it is a Paradoxe, but as it is repugnant to Scripture, it is a Cacodoxe. 2. When you say that <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaketh of that light which shall be in stead of the Sun and Moon, doe you answer any thing at all to his testimony? <hi>Thy Sun shall no more goe downe, &amp;c.</hi> for hee distinguisheth between that light which God shall give to his Saints, and the light of the Sun which shall no more goe downe; so that hee doth not confound these two lights which are in God and in the Sun, as you would have it. A part of the Churches happinesse shall be, that shee shall both enjoy the light of the Sun without intermission, and also that new inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible light of divine vision. If then the Sun shall goe downe no more, it argues that the Sun useth to goe downe: Now, if you will have these words understood mystically, yet the thing to which they doe allude must be understood properly; to wit, the going down of the Sun. 3. You will have time to be measured by the motion of the earth, not of the heaven; and this you prove out of <hi>Pererius,</hi> who saith, That time depends upon the motion and succession of any duration: But <hi>Pererius</hi> explaines himselfe in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place: that that is only time properly and principally, which is measured by the motion of the <hi>primum mobile</hi>: because the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heaven is the first, and the cause of all other motions; and because it is the least, as being the swiftest; and it is most certaine, and uniforme, universall, and known to all: so that if the earth did move (which as yet you have not proved) yet these conditions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree with the earths motion: time which is measured by other motions, is not properly and formally, but materially and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49171:55"/>
so called,; so it is false that the earths motion is the cause of time, which <hi>Pererius</hi> never affirmed or dreamed of. 4. You will have the heavens subject to other vanities besides that of motion; as first unto many changes, witnesse the comets seen amongst them; and then to that generall corruption in the last day, when they shall passe away with a noise, &amp;c. <hi>Answ.</hi> If changes be vanity, to how much vanity is your world in the Moon subject, which so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten changeth? 2. Though the heavenly bodies were subject to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanities, as you say, yet these will not exempt them from the vanity of motion. 3. How comets, which are Gods extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry workes, and denouncers of his judgements, are vanities, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not. 4. That the Apostle speaks of comets in that place, is your part to prove either by reason or authority. 5. That co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets which are seen onely by us in the aire, are discerned by you amongst the heavenly bodies, is no wonder, seeing you can discern a world in the Moon. 6. St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> on that place sheweth, that the vanity to which the heaven is subject, is the continuall toile of their motion, and that it expects rest, that it may be delivered from servile work. 7. If the heavens be subject to the vanity of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as you say, tell us whether you speak properly and philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, or metaphorically? If philosophically, you are absurd; for every fresh-man can tell you that heaven is not capable of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and corruption; if metaphorically, you speak impertinently; for by the passing away of heaven, is meant onely the abolition of imperfect qualities, and a perfecting of it to a more glorious estate. 8. <hi>The heavens</hi> (you say) <hi>are subject to that generall corruption in which all creatures shall be involved in the last day.</hi> But you cannot tell us what that corruption shall be, and so you speak at randome: you doe not mean (I hope) that the heavens shall be involved in the same corruption with snakes, rats, toads, and other such kinde of creatures.</p>

If heaven and earth have their Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy from what they seeme to be, not from what they are; then the like may be said of other things. Fire is called <hi>focus, à fovendo,</hi> from cherishing; the sea is called <hi>mare, quasi amarum,</hi> because it is salt or bitter; not that these things are so, but because they seem to be so: the like may be said of other Etymologies. 3. For your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Hebrew word <hi>Erets</hi> from <hi>Ruts,</hi> because it runs, is but a running motion of your head.

               <p>You object to your selfe, <hi>How are two distinct motions conceiveable in the earth at the same time?</hi> and you answer you selfe, <hi>that it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily apprehended, considering how both these motions tend from West to East, as you instance in a bowle. Answ.</hi> How the earth should have two distinct circular motions, is not conceiveable by us, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mostrable by you. Your similie of the bowle is a poor demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, and indeed, false; for it running on the superficies of the ground, hath not two circular motions, as you should have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but onely one such motion or rowling; the other as it moves from your hand to the mark, is the motion of projection; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the bowles motion, is indeed but one, being a mixed or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded motion; neither doth it move with two distinct circular motions in the same place the same time, as you will have the earth to doe: but it runs from one place to another; neither is it naturall, but violent: and though it were true that the bowle had two distinct circular motions in the same place at the same time, yet it will not prove that the earth is either capable, or we conceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

of these two motions, considering the disproportion that is between the vast and heavy earth, and a small light bowle.</p>

I should thinke that your head was giddy when you wrote this, and that indeed you can no more dispute of these things, then a blinde man can doe of colours; neither can we give you any credit untill first you goe thither, and bring us a certificate signed with the hands of these Angels which turne about the orbes; otherwise you will but loose your labour:

               <p n="1">1. <hi>You will have us suppose that the earth is the cause of this motion</hi>; but this wee may not suppose, for if there be any motion in the earth, the earth is the subject of that motion, but not the cause;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49171:57"/>
for nothing can move it selfe; <hi>movens &amp; mobile</hi> are distinct things: but what if we should suppose what you desire, what will be gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby? to wit this, That the heavens shall be freed from their inconceivable swiftnesse: and is not this a goodly reason. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive how the heavens move so swiftly as they say, <hi>ergo</hi> we must suppose the earth to move? Shall we suppose the fire to be cold, because we cannot tell how the sunne is hot? If one cannot tell how the eye seeth, will you bid him suppose that the foot seeth? This is, <hi>homines ex stultis insanos facere:</hi> let the swiftnesse of heaven be never so great, we cannot suppose the earth to move. For that they may be swifter then our thoughts, is not impossible, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we look on Gods power, or on the aptitude in these bodies for such a motion: <hi>But you will not have us flye to Gods power what he can doe</hi>: I pray you then whither shall we flie? <hi>If we goe up into heaven he is there, if we goe downe to hell he is there also. &amp;c. Whatsoever is done in heaven, and in the earth, &amp;c. he doth it himselfe,</hi> saith <hi>David. Hee sustaineth all things by the word of his power; In him we live, move, and have our being:</hi> therefore the Philosophers said well, that he was the first mover, and that the outmost heaven was the first moveable. <hi>But if you will have us looke unto the usuall way of providence what is most likely to be done,</hi> then we say that it is most likely, that the heavens move, and the earth stands still, as is already proved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>You say, the heavens being vast, materiall, condensate substances, are not capable of such a motion:</hi> I heare words but to no purpose, for you should tell us, whether the matter of heaven, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densation thereof be like this of the earth; and whether the mover be so weake as that he cannot turne about that vast body.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>sec.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> I had told you heretofore that bodies move swifter or slower, not because they are greater or lesser, but because they are heavier or lighter Motion which you call a Geometricall thing (but you are in this decived) depends not from quantitie, lesser bodies move oftentimes flower then the greater; a snaile then an elephant, a pebble stone then a great cloud: it is not then beyond the phansie of a Poet, or mad-man, (as you madly speake) for the heaven to move very swiftly; but if any man will take upon him to tell exactly how swiftly the heaven moveth, or that the earth moveth at all; I must needs tell him that he needs hellebor.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When we say that the heavens are bodies without gravitie, you answer us with your recocted coleworts, or idle evasion of yours so often repeated, <hi>That the whole earth in its owne place is not heavy:</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:49171:57"/>
which shift we have divers times already refuted: but when you say, <hi>That the heavens being of a materiall substance, it's impossible but that there should be in them some ineptitude to motion:</hi> you speake like one who is a stranger to Philosophie, for if it were not for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there would be no motion in the world. As the forme moveth, so it is by reason of the matter that all things are moved, so that where there is matter, there can be no ineptitude to motion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the matter. But it is a rugged conceit in you when you say, <hi>That it's not conceiveable how the upper spheare should move the lower, unlesse their superficies were full of rugged parts, or else they must leane one upon the other. Answ.</hi> What rugged parts are there in the superficies of winds and clouds, when the windes move the clouds? or what ruggednesse is there in smooth waters, when in rivers the formost waters are moved forward by the hindermost? Or in the smoake when it carrieth upward a piece of paper? But when you say, That the farther any spheare is distant from the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> the lesse it is hindered by it, in its proper course: It is true, and yet not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to <hi>Ptolomies</hi> opinion, who saith, That in heaven there is no reluctancie; for his meaning is, that there is no inferiour spheare that hindereth the swiftnesse of the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> and that is the reason why it is so swift: because it hath no resistance either from the forme, or from the matters; or thicknesse of the medium.</p>
               <p>Novv, <hi>In nova fert animus,</hi> — you vvould faine play the Poet, and build castles in the aire, but indeed you have already played the Poet too much; for your vvhole booke is nothing else but a heap of fictions; your vvorld in the Moone, your moving earth, your standing heavens, your figures and characters, what are they else but pleasant dreames, and idle phansies, fit enough to be inserted into <hi>Ovids Metamorphosis,</hi> if you could digest them into good verses? And you doe not onely play the Poet, but the Painter also in your figures, for a fictitious Picture is a visible Poem, and a Poem is an audible Picture, Painters and Poets have authority you knovv. <hi>But you wonder much why Poets have not feigned a castle to be made of the same materials with the solid orbes. Answ.</hi> I thinke the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did not knovv that there vvere people in the Moone; if they had knovvn this, doubtlesse they vvould have fitted them vvith inchanted castles, and other buildings; novv vvhat they have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, doe you, that posterity vvhen you are dead may say;

                  </q>
But I vvill not novv spend time in vievving the parts and materials of your Poeticall castle, till you have brought it to perfection; and then I vvill take a survey of every particular.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I had said that a bigger body, as a mill-stone, vvill naturally descent svvifter then a lesse, as a pebble stone; the cause of this, <hi>You will not have to be ascribed to the bodies bignesse, but to the strength of naturall desire which that big body hath to such a motion. Answ.</hi> You make a shevv as if you did ansvver our argument, but in effect you ansvver nothing: for if I should aske you vvhy a mill-stone falls faster then a pebble, you will answer, because it hath a stronger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to fall; but if I aske againe why it hath a stronger desire, you answer, because the bigger a thing is, the stronger is its desire, &amp;c. and is not your opinion now all one with mine in effect? that it is the bignesse that is the cause of this swiftnesse? now the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is appliable to bodies moving circularly: for though they were in their proper scituations, yet there is in them as great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to move about the center, as there is in elementary bodies to move to and from the center; therefore, the greater the body is, the greater desire it hath to move according to your opinion. Againe, I said that the winde will sooner move a great ship then a little stone, you answer, <hi>This is not because a ship is more easily moveable then a little stone, but because a little stone is not so liable to the violence from whence its motion proceeds.</hi> This answer is as wise as the former, for why is not the stone as liable to the violent cause of its motion as the ship, but because it is not so big, therefore the ship is more easily moveable then the stone; because by reason of its bignesse it's more liable to the violent cause of its motion. And when you say, <hi>That I cannot throw a ship as farre as a stone</hi>; I grant it, but this will onely argue want of strength in me, but not want of aptitude for a swifter motion in the ship then in the stone, if I had strength to sling the one as well as the other. A bigger bullet out of the same peece will flie farther and swifter then a lesser.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I brought some instances to illustrate the possibility of the heavens swiftnesse, as the sound of a cannon twenty miles off; of the sight of a starre in a moment, of the light passing suddenly from East to West; of the swiftnesse of a bullet carried by the powder; to these you answer, <hi>That the passage of a sound is but slow, compared to the heavens motion; that the species of sound or sight are accidents, and so is the light; that the disproportion is great betwixt the heavens motion
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49171:58"/>
and the swiftnesse of a bullet. Answ.</hi> Let the sound, and light, and species be what they will be, they are moved; and if they be acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents they cannot be moved alone, but with the subject in which they are inherent: therefore, if there be such swiftnesse in the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these, what need we doubt of the swiftnesse of the heavens? and if accidents can be so swiftly moved with and in their subjects, much swifter must be these heavenly substances having no resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, whose matter is so pure, that it is a great furtherance to their motion: and though there be great disproportion betwixt the bullets motion and the heavens swiftnesse, yet the motion of the one serves to illustrate the swiftnesse of the other. And yet I take not upon me as you doe, peremptorily to tell how swift the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are; and though I said that the light was an accident, yet I said also that it was <hi>corpori simillimum,</hi> that it comes very neere to the nature of a body: neither did <hi>Aristotle</hi> prove the light to be no body, because of its swiftnesse, as if no body were capable of that swiftnesse, for then he should contradict himselfe as you use to doe; but he meanes that no sublunarie body had so swift a motion. It had been folly to illustrate the swiftnesse of the bullets motion by the motion of the hand in the watch; for there by many other motions far swifter then this to expresse the bullets motion: but of sublunary motions there be none swifter then those I alledged to illustrate the motion of heaven.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>You would have the earth to be both the efficient and finall cause of its motion:</hi> But indeed it is neither the one nor the other, for if it move at all, it must be moved by another mover then it selfe: and God made the heavens not for the earth, but for man; so the diurnall and annuall motions have man for their finall cause, and heavenly movers for their efficient. 2. You say, <hi>That nature is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tedious in that which may be done an easier way:</hi> This I will not grant you, for nature doth not still worke the easiest, but the most convenient way; but I deny that the earths motion is either more easie or more convenient then that of heaven; for a light body, such as heaven is, is more easily moved then a heavy; and it is more convenient that the foundation of our houses should remain firme and stable, then moveable, as I said. I could tell you how labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and tedious nature is in the perfecting of mans body, and of many other things, therefore she doth not take still the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49171:59"/>
way. 3. You say, <hi>It is not likely that the heaven should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe so great and constant a worke which might be saved by the circumvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the earths body.</hi> How tender hearted are you? are you afraid that the heavens will grow wearie? and I pray you, is not heaven sitter to undergoe a great and constant worke then the earth, so small, so dull, so heavy, so subject to change? a great worke is fit for a great body, and a constant work fit for that body that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no unconstancy. 4. You are deceived when you say, <hi>That the heaven receiveth no perfection by its motion, but is made serviceable to this little ball of earth.</hi> The perfection of heaven consisteth in its motion, as the earths perfection in its rest; neither was heaven made to serve this ball, but to serve him who was made Lord of this ball. 5. <hi>Your Similies of a mother warming her childe, of a Cooke rosting his meat, of a man on a tower, of a Watch maker,</hi> are all frivolous. For a mother turneth her childe, and a Cook his meat to the fire, because the fire cannot turne it selfe to them; the motion is in them, not in the fire: so he that is on a tower, turnes himselfe round to see the countrey, because the countrey cannot turne it selfe about him. If you had proved to us that the heaven cannot move, but that it is the earth that moveth, then we should yeeld that the earth did foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly to expect the celestiall fire to turne about her; but this you have not as yet proved, neither will you be ever able to prove. The earth indeed is a mother, but as senslesse and stupid as <hi>Niobe,</hi> who would suffer her children to starve with cold, if that heavenly fire did not move about her. As for your instance of a Watch-maker, I will use it in your owne words, but to our purpose: <hi>If a wise Watch-maker will not put any superfluous motion in his instrument, shall we not thinke that nature is as provident as any ordinary mechanicke?</hi> Therefore doubtlesse it had been superfluous for the earth to move. And whereas you say, <hi>That the motion of the starres is full of confusion and uncertainties:</hi> That is true in respect of your ignorance; there is an heavenly order, and harmony amongst them, the confusion is in your head, and the uncertainty in your knowledge.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You say, <hi>That motion is most agreeable to that which in kinde and properties is neerest to the bodies that are moved.</hi> But this I say is false, for an immoveable body is not made capable of motion, because it is neere in some properties to the body that is moved. A rocke and a mill-stone which perhaps was taken out of the same rocke, agree
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49171:59"/>
in kinde and properties, will it therefore follow, that because the mill-stone moves round, the rocke also moves round? The sea-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and well-water agree in kinde and properties, doth the well-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therefore ebbe and flow? But your drift is to shew, <hi>That the earth moveth with the six Planets, because both Earth and Planets have a borrowed light, whereas the Sunne and fixed Stars have it of their own. Answ.</hi> A goodly reason, the earth must move as well as the sixe Planets, because it hath a borrowed light as well as they; as if you would say, <hi>Saturne</hi> and the Moone have a borrowed light, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have the same motion and bignesse: or thus, the Planets have a borrowed light as well as the earth, therefore, they rest, or be as heavie as the earth; but what if I should say, the Planets have some light of their owne, as may be seen by the Moone, which the earth hath not; and therefore they agree not in this property of light, and consequently the earth moveth not as they doe. But when you say the fixed stars have light of their owne, you speake at randome, for you can shew no reason of this conceit, why the fixed starres should have light of their owne, and not the Planets; or why the Planets borrow light, and not the fixed stars. Againe, you thinke, <hi>That the Sunne and Stars should rest, because they are of a more excellent nature:</hi> As if motion did belong to the ignoblest creatures; we know the contrary, Man is a more noble creature then a rocke, yet man moveth, and the rocke is immoveable. The heart in our bodies is more noble then the guts, yet that moveth, they move not. Is the body of man lesse excellent when it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the soule, then when it is at rest putrifying in the grave. When water rests from its motion it loseth its excellencie, and stinketh, therefore, motion in many things is more noble then rest: as for the rest which you say is ascribed to God, that is not to our purpose, for it is transcendent and hyperphysicall; and as God is said to rest, so he is said to move, therefore called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But why you should thinke the fixed Starres of a more excellent nature then the Planets, I know not, neither can you give any reason for it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Aristotle</hi> you say tels us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Coelo. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note> that the time of the revolution of each orbe should be proportionable to its bignesse, which can only be you thinke, <hi>By making the earth a Planet.</hi> I answer, that of two evills the lesse is to be chosen, and better it is that there should be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49171:60"/>
some disproportion between the bignesse of the orbes, and the time of their motion, then that the earth should move. 2. You cannot exactly tell what disproportion there is in their motions, till first you finde out the true knowledge of their magnitudes.</p>
               <p>That the Comets which move in the aire are not moved by the heavens, but by the earth, you prove; <hi>Because the concave superficies of the Moone is thought to be smooth, so that the meere touch of it cannot turne about the fire with a motion not naturall to it; nor can the subtle fire move the thicker aire, nor this the waters. Answ.</hi> How the upper spheares move the lower, is neither knowne to you nor me but by conjectures. 2. I have already shewed that one smooth body by its touch may move another, as the winde moves the clouds; so in the Northerne seas, one mountaine of ice which is smooth, moves the other forward. 3. The subtiltie and puritie of the fire is no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to its moving of the thicker aire, for doe not our animall spirits which are pure and subtle, and yet materiall, move our grosse bodies? Doth not the winde move grosse substances? 4. That the aire doth not move the water, is repugnant to experience, for within the Tropickes, the sea is continually moved from East to West by the aire; and this by the heaven as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed elsewhere. 5. That the circular motion of the fire is not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, is false; for though this motion proceed not from an inward principle, as the straight motion doth, yet it is naturall, because the nature of the fire is preserved by it; for the fire never gives off moving upward, till it begin to move circularly, and then is it in its chiefe perfection when it hath attained this motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lansbergius</hi> you say concludes that the earth is easily moveable, from the words of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who said, that he could move the earth, if he knew where to stand and fasten his instrument; it is a foolish conclusion, for so he might as well conclude, that armed men may arise out of the ground, because <hi>Pompey</hi> said, that if he did but stampe with his foot, the ground would yeeld him armed men. So because <hi>Medaea</hi> said:
<q>Ego inter auras aliti curru vebar;</q>
That shee would flie in the aire in a chariot drawne by dragons, that therefore shee could doe as shee said; this is to play the Poet.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The opinion of Intelligences, by which the heavens are moved (you say) hath its originall from <hi>Aristotle's</hi> mistake, who held the heavens to

be eternall. I answer, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> was mistaken in holding the heavens to be eternall <hi>à priori</hi>; but I deny that there is any errour in holding them to be eternall <hi>à posteriori,</hi> in respect of their substance. 2. <hi>Aristotle</hi> might have held the opinion of Intelligences, without holding the heavens to be eternall; for the eternity of the mover doth not necessarily inferre the eternity of the thing moved: God is eternall, so is not the world, our soules are eternall, so are not our bodies. 3. You prove, <hi>That Intelligences are superfluous, because a naturall power intrinsecall to these bodies will serve the turne as well:</hi> So you might inferre that our soules are superfluous, because a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall power resulting from the matter of our bodies, and intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to them will serve the turne as well. But indeed such excellent bodies as the heavens did require a more excellent forme then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary bodies doe; for these are content with an informing form, but the heavens stood in need of an assisting forme: and how can we conceive that out of such pure and simple materials as the heavens are, there should result a naturall power to move them cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, orderly, constantly, perpetually? If our grosse and decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bodies are moved with reasonable soules, which though they be internall formes, result not from the power of the matter; much more should the heavens be regulated by Intelligent spirits, and not by any naturall power. 4. This naturall power of moving must be either the forme brought out of the matter, which is done by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but in heaven there is no generation, because there is no privation of an other forme, or any appetite in the matter to it; or else this power must be a forme brought into the matter: but no forme is introduced into the matter, except the reasonable soule; therefore, there is no informing forme in heaven, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there can be no other movers but Angels. This Argument I ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against <hi>Carpenter,</hi> but you winked at it and said nothing. 5. You say, <hi>That Intelligences being immaterials cannot immediately worke upon a body.</hi> What is this to the purpose? If they work upon bodies, it's no matter how they worke; wee know that our soules worke upon our grosse bodies, and so doe the Intelligences upon the heavens: we know that spirits work upon muteriall substances immediately, or else there would be no working at all; and it is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous in you to disable the Angels from working or moving, because they have no instruments or hands to take hold of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49171:61"/>
What hands hath your soule when it works on your body? What hands hath the winde when it moves the clouds? 6. You have no reason to insult so over the Schoole-men, who affirme, that the faculty whereby the Angels move their orbes, is their will; for what faculty else can you imagine in them? Doth not your soule worke upon your body by the will? so, that albeit there be many instruments by which the soule moveth the body, yet the prime faculty by which it moveth is the will: so that if you suspend your act of willing a motion, you must needs stand still; and on the contrary, your onely willing to move the hand or foot is sufficient as the chiefe medium or faculty to move them. And so it is with the heavens, saving onely that there are no subordinate organs by which the Angelicall will doth move the heavens: but when you say that there was no need of Angels, <hi>since this might be as well done by the will of God:</hi> You speake idlely, for so you may say that there is no need of our soules to move our bodies, since this might be as well done by the will of God: Angelicall and humane wills are subordinate and serviceable to the will of God, but not excluded by it; <hi>For in him we live and move,</hi> and yet we live and move by our soules too. And as impertinent is your other question, <hi>How the orbes are capable of perceiving this will in the Intelligences, or what motive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty have they of themselves to inable them to obey? Answ.</hi> The orbes are as capable to perceive the will of the Angels, as your body is to perceive your will, or as those bodies were which the Angels of old assumed, and by them conversed with the Patriarchs: and as those bodies had a motive faculty to obey the Angels will, so have the heavens much more.</p>
               <p>Keplar's <hi>opinion that the Planets are moved round by the Sunne, and that this is done by sending forth a magneticke vertue, and that the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames are like the teeth of a wheele, taking hold of the Planets,</hi> are sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse crotchets, fitter for a wheeler or miller, then a Philosopher: This magneticke vertue is a salve for all sores, a pin to stop every hole, for still when you are reduced to a non-plus, magneticke ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is your onely subterfuge, like <hi>AEneas</hi> his target, <hi>Unum omniae contra tela Latinorum:</hi> If you had told us that the North starre had a magneticke vertue, because the needle touched with the <hi>magnes</hi> looketh towards it, some silly people perhaps would have beleeved you, and yet the magneticke vertue is in the needle, not in the star;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49171:61"/>
but that in the Sunne there should be a magneticke vertue, it hath no show of probability. <hi>This vertue</hi> (you say) <hi>may hold out to as great a distance as light or heat</hi>: But if this comparison hold, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that there is no such vertue in the Sunne, for that light which is in the aire is not in the Sunne, neither is that heate which wee feele caused by the Sunne, in the Sunne: but your following words are admirable; <hi>That if the Moone may move the sea, why may not the Sunne move the earth?</hi> As if you would say, If the North-winde shake the woods, why may not the South-winde shake the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines? Or (according to your doctrine) if the earth can move the Moone, why may not <hi>Venus</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi> move the Sunne? or why may not the Sunne move the Firmament?</p>
               <p>You conclude well, <hi>That your Quare's are but conjectures, and that no man can finde out the workes of God from the beginning to the end:</hi> and yet you have found out that which God never made, to wit, a rolling Earth, a standing Heaven, a world in the Moone; which indeed are not the workes of God, but of your owne head: for his workes are incomprehensible, his wayes past find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out. Trouble not then your selfe too much in these things, which in this life you cannot understand; learne to know your selfe that wee may know you too, and by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your selfe, strive to know God, the knowledge of whom is life eternall.

               <p>THis proposition is full of suppositions, fraughted with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and characters, which more affect the eye then satisfie the minde; neither doe they demonstrate the motions of the earth, but the motions of your head. The pictures in <hi>Ovids Metamorphosis</hi> adde not the more credit to his fictions, neither
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49171:62"/>
doe these figures to you phansies: wee will beleeve no more then you can demostrate by sense or reason; demonstrations are of things true and reall, not of dreames and imaginations: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither your pictures, nor bare words, shall perswade us, that dayes, moneths, yeares, houres, weekes, &amp;c. are or can be caused by the earths motion, till first you have proved that the earth moveth; you that cannot abide Eccentrickes and Epicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the heavens, are forced now to make use of them, both for the motion of the Moone, and of the earth too; so that you have not mended but marred the matter, rejecting <hi>Ptolomy</hi> because of Eccentrickes and Epicycles, aud yet you admit <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> with his new devised Moone Eccentricks, and Earth Eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trickes, so that you thinke by these fictions to solve the divers illuminations, bignesse, eclipses, &amp;c. of the Moone. A phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall Astronomer might devise other wayes besides these of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Copernicus,</hi> to shew the different appearances of the Planets; for of things that are uncertaine and beyond our reach, divers men will have divers conceits and conjectures: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have held, and doe at this day yet maintaine, that the stars have soules and are living creatures, and why may not this be as true as your opinion, that there is a world of living creatures in the Moone? What if I should hold that the eight spheare is a solid sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, therefore called <hi>firmamentum,</hi> full of holes, some great and some small; so that these lights which wee call starres are but beames of that bright and cleare heaven above, called <hi>Empyreum,</hi> shining through these holes? Or if I should say, that every starre had its Angel moving it about the earth, as wee use in darke nights to carry lanternes: divers Nations of <hi>Asia, Africke,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> have divers opinions of the starres, and few or none true, all which do argue our ignorance and foolishnesse; we are but
<q>Curvae in terris animae, &amp; coelestium inanes.</q>
But any of these conjectures mentioned, is as probable as yours of the earths motion; therefore, I was not without sense and reason when I concluded my Booke with this Argument, That if the Sunne stood still, there could be no variation of the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in the Sunne Diall: you will say that may be altered by the earths motion, but I say to you as I said to M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                  <hi>Carpenter,</hi> prove that, and what I profered to him, I also profer to you:
<q>—Phillida solus habeto.</q>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:49171:62"/>
You will say this may be easily proved, if I will admit the earth to move: but so you may say, that you will easily prove an Asse to flye, if I should admit that hee hath wings; but I will not admit that upon a false maxime of your devising, you shall inferre what you please. What if I should admit an absurd conceit of yours, that the Earth draweth the Moone about? can you prove mee, that when the Moone shineth there is any variation of shadowes, when both the luminous and opace body are moved with the same motion?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The difference</hi> (you say) <hi>betweene Summer and Winter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the number and length of dayes, and of the Sunnes motion from Signe to Signe, and all other appearances of the Sunne concerning the annuall motion, may be seene by your Figures; and easily solved by supposing the earth to move in an Eccentricall orbe about the Sunne. Answ.</hi> Not the Sunnes appearances but your phantasies are to be seene by your figures; the earth doth not move because your figure represents it: it is also an easie matter to suppose things that never were, nor can be; you suppose the earth to move about the Sunne, and not the Sunne about the earth: you may as well suppose the house to be carried about the candle, and not the candle about the house, and so all appearances may be solved as well this way as the other; for if the house did move about the candle, the house shall be seene as well as if the candle did move about the house: and why may we not suppose the house to move sometimes neerer to, and sometimes farther from the candle, the neerer it moveth, the more it is illuminate, &amp;c. But what <hi>Cato</hi> is so grave as to refraine from laughter at such absurd and foolish suppositions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You spend much paper to shew how the Planets will appeare direct, stationary, retrograde, and yet still move regularly about their owne centers.</hi> This is, <hi>Magno conatu magnas nugas dicere</hi>; and who but <hi>Iudaeus apella</hi> will beleeve, that one motion of the earth should cause so many different appearances in the severall Planets? how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever you talke of <hi>Ptolomie's</hi> Wheele-worke, I preferre his Wheele to your Whirlegig. It is more easie for many Planets to wheele about, then for one rocke or piece of earth to whirle about: but you are as exact in placing the Planets, as if you had been upon the top of <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder. You place <hi>Mercury</hi> next to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49171:63"/>
the Sunne, hiding himselfe under his rayes; you say well, for theeves doe use to hide themselves; but for one to hide himselfe in the open light is not usuall: darknesse (one would thinke) were more proper then that; But how <hi>Mercury</hi> hath a more lively vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous light then any of the other, I understand not: I should rather thinke that there were a more lively vigorous light in the Sun, Moone, and <hi>Venus.</hi> And whereas you say that <hi>Venus</hi> in her conjunction with the Sunne doth not appeare horned, is true; but if her husband <hi>Vulcan</hi> had beene as neere the Sunne, his hornes doubtlesse had beene seene; doe not you know how much ashamed <hi>Venus</hi> was, when the Sunne looked upon her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in bed with <hi>Mars?</hi> Now, that the orbe of <hi>Mars</hi> contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our earth within it, I will not deny; but I am sure our earth containeth <hi>Mars</hi> within it, who is oftentimes too exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant:
<q>—Toto saevit Mars impius orbe.</q>
                  <hi>And that the orbe of the Moone comprehends the earth in it, because shee is sometimes in opposition to the Sunne,</hi> is a feeble reason; as, though the opposition of two round bodies should be the cause why that which is in the midst betwixt them, should be within the circumference of either of their circles or orbes. Other Planets have their oppositions, is therefore the earth within the orbe of either of them? Or why is the earth more within the orb of the Moone then of the Sun, seeing the Moone is no more in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Sun, then the Sun is to the Moone?</p>
               <p n="3">3. You conclude your Booke with a large digression upon the commendations of Astronomy, which hath for its object the whole world you say, And therefore farre exceeds the barren speculation of <hi>universale,</hi> and <hi>materia prima. Answ.</hi> It seemes you have left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the objects of other sciences, if Astronomy must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosse the whole world for its object. 2. <hi>Vniversum,</hi> belike, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds <hi>Vniversale</hi> with you, and the extent of the one is not so large, nor the speculation so fruitfull, as of the other; but surely your <hi>Vniversum</hi> or world in the Moone is as barren a notion, as that of <hi>Vniversale.</hi> 3. <hi>The knowledge of Philosophy and Logicke, is but cobweb learning in your conceit</hi>; but we thinke that these cobwebs are strong enough to catch such flyes as you; and indeed there is more substance in these cobwebs then in your Astronomicall dreames and phansies. 4. What you say of other knowledge,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49171:63"/>
                  <hi>That is depends upon conjectures and uncertainty</hi>; is most true of your Astronomicall Booke, wherein I have found nothing but suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, may-bee's, conjectures, and uncertainties. 5. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you say, That man had <hi>os sublime,</hi> a face to looke upward, that he might be an Astronomer: You are deceived, it was that hee might be a Divine; for the starres were made, not that he should doate upon them in idle speculations and niceties full of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, but that by their light and motion he might be brought to the knowledge of Divinity, which your self in your subsequent discourse is forced to acknowledge. But take heed you play not the Anatomist upon these celestiall bodies, (whose inward parts are hid from you) in the curious and needlesse search of them; you may well lose your selfe, but this way you shall never finde God. 6. Whereas you say, <hi>That Astronomy serves to confirme the truth of the holy Scripture:</hi> you are very preposterous, for you will have the truth of Scripture confirmed by Astronomie, but you will not have the truth of Astronomie confirmed by Scripture: sure one would thinke that Astronomicall truths had more need of the Scripture confirmation, then the Scripture of them.
