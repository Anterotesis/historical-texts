         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But it is unaccountable, that in a Matter that Salvation does ſo much depend upon, in their Opinion, they ſhould lay ſo much ſtreſs (as they commonly do) on the Opinions of Men, and the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the antient Church: ſeing, 1.

the only Judge in ſuch Controverſies.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The Fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves plead for this, and diſown both each himſelf, and one another as either Judge, or ſufficient Witneſs in ſuch Debates:</hi> Optat.

Profecto ſi recte in judicando ſapis, longe nos infra vides ab illa authoritate diſtare. <hi>Yea, in particular, this mark of Inſufficiency to prove a Divine Truth, is ſet on</hi> Cyprian'<hi>s Authority, by</hi> Auguſtine, l. 2. <hi>contra</hi> Creſcon. <hi>cap.</hi> 32.

Nos nullam <hi>Cypriano</hi> facimus injuriam, cum ejus quaſlibet literas à Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonica divinarum literarum authoritate diſtinguimus. Thirdly, <hi>It is obſervable, that even the</hi> Affrican <hi>Fathers, after</hi> Cyprian, <hi>do not ſpeak ſo high of Epiſcopal Praelation, as</hi> Cyprian <hi>doth; as</hi> Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, <hi>Cited in the Book it ſelf, his</hi> ſecundum honorum vocabula, <hi>and</hi> uſus obtinuit; <hi>are two conſiderable Diminutives, and derogate the one from the Degree of Epiſcopal Authority, the other from the Perpetuity and Divine Right of it.

<pb facs="tcp:150243:3"/>
Matter, or (which I rather think)</hi> Cyprian <hi>uſed higher, and more keen Expreſſions, for the ſame things, and that out of a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Zeal, that he had for the Dignity of the Church; and to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his Office.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>It is evident that the Antient Biſhops, and other Divines, when they gave Marks of the True Church, brought them always from the Scripture, not from Humane Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> Auguſt. Ep. 50. Bonifacio Comiti: in Sanctis Libris ubi manifeſtatur Dominus Chriſtus, ibi &amp; ejus Eccleſia declaratur: <hi>Where alſo he Chargeth them with Wonderful Blindneſs, who ſeek Chriſt in the Scripture, and the Church in Humane Writings. Alſo</hi> Cyprian. Ep. Coecilio; <hi>and in that to</hi> Pompeius, <hi>proveth that we must follow Chriſt and his written Word only, as our Rule, and not old Cuſtoms and Practices. The ſame thing</hi> Gerſon <hi>proveth, in a Sermon before the</hi> Pope, <hi>and aſſerteth that the Scripture is ſufficient for the Government of the Church: and calleth it Blaſphemy to ſay, that it can be better done by mens Inventions.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>The Antient Biſhops (even ſuch of them as were Holy and Humble,) might have too high Thoughts of their own Praelation, and too much Inclination to greaten it. That Temper appeared among the Apoſtles, while Chriſt was with them. Great Corruptions in the Church have Inſenſibly had their Beginning from Good and Zealous Men.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>Many Famous and Learned Biſhops, much later than theſe called Fathers, and yet before the Reformation from</hi> Popery, <hi>held that Biſhops and Presbyters were by Divine Inſtitution every way one, ſo</hi> Anſelm <hi>Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>on</hi> Philip. 1. <hi>and</hi> Tit. 1. Rich. Armachan. in quaeſt.

               <pb facs="tcp:150243:4"/>
Seventhly, <hi>Even Mr.</hi> Dodwell <hi>(as high as he is for Epiſcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,) ſaith, that</hi> the firſt Biſhops were made by Presbyters: and that it behoved to be ſo, otherwiſe the Succeſſion could not be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the firſt times of Perſecution. <hi>How this conſiſteth either with our Author's Book or with his own, againſt</hi> Separation from the Epiſcopal Chairs, <hi>let the Reader judge. It's true, Mr.</hi> Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <hi>(it is 521, 522.) pretendeth</hi> not to be afraid of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this Aſſertion, with Reſpect to the Biſhop's abſolute Power, becauſe Kings alſo are Inveſted by their Subjects, <hi>(this Paralell I might, but ſhall not Debate with him,) but how can he, on this Suppoſition, defend their ſole Power of Ordination to be of Divine Right; I cannot ſee, but ſhall be glad to be inſtructed. I inſist not on the Suſpicion, that</hi> Cyprian'<hi>s Epistles are corrupted; tho'</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine Ep. 48. Vincentio; <hi>hath theſe words,</hi> neque enim potuit integritas atque notitia literarum unius quantumlibet illuſtris Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi, (<hi>Cyprian</hi> ſcil.) cuſtodiri quemadmodum Scriptura Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonica, &amp;c. <hi>What is ſaid, may derogate much from the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that my Antagonist bringeth, and warrant our putting a ſenſe on them, different from the ſound they have in the Ears of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and ſome others of his Perſwaſion. The Reader may know, that our Debate is not about the</hi> Jus, <hi>but</hi> Factum; <hi>not how the Church ſhould be Governed, but how it was done in the Age mentioned. In which, I affirm that tho' it is manifest, that the Biſhop was above the Presbyter in Dignity and Order, yet he did not Rule the Church by himſelf, but the Presbyters had equal Power with him in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Church-Government.</hi>

Then, if we ſhould grant all that he pleadeth for, it would not ruine the Cauſe of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, nor eſtabliſh Prelacy: It would amount to no more but this, that one Presbyterian, and he among the meaneſt of them, did miſtake in matter of Fact, as it is related in the Antient Hiſtory. He might know, that neither the Presbyterians generally, nor that Author in particular, did ever lay the Streſs of their Cauſe on the Practice or Principles of the Church, after the Apoſtolick Age: Tho' we will not yield the Suffrage of later Antiquity to be for our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries: yet that is the Antiquity that we build upon; for it is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, not humane Authority that we take for the Rule of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Practice, in the matter of Church-Government, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the Affairs of the Houſe of GOD. <hi>Timothy</hi> was to be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 14, 15. and ſo will we. And even the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of the <hi>Vindication</hi> againſt the <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> or <hi>his Friend,</hi> (as our Author calleth him, <hi>P.</hi> 4.) hath fully declared his Opinion to this purpoſe; <hi>Rational Defence of Non-conformity, P.</hi> 158. which Book our Author ſeemeth to be no ſtranger to; for he is (<hi>P.</hi> 69) at pains to cite and try his critical Skill upon a Paſſage in it. He could not then, think to ſilence Presbyterians by this his Attempt: we have other Grounds, if we were beaten from this, as I hope we ſhall not. If his Book was written only to convince the World, that he who wrote the <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Vindication</hi> againſt the <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> is not infallible in all that he aſſerteth; he might have ſpared his pains: that ſhould eaſily have been yielded to him. To write a Book of Twelve Sheets on ſuch a Subject, is ſuch Work as we have no time for. <hi>Egregiam verô laudem, &amp; ſpolia ampla</hi>—He had read <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s <hi>Epistles</hi> (which are not very voluminous) and had made a Collection of Citations; and thus they muſt have a vent.</p>
            <p>§. 3. The Paſſage that he buildeth his whole Fabrick upon, was by the <hi>Defender</hi> (which is my ſecond Remark) ſet down with that Brevity that was ſutable to the purpoſe in hand; tho' may be not ſufficient to preclude all the critical Notes that a Man of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150243:5"/>
Skill and Learning could make, when he is ſo diſpoſed to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Apologiſt</hi> had, in a rambling and incoherent way, ſtarted a Number of Debates that are between us and the Prelatiſts, inſiſting on none of them: And the <hi>Defender</hi> thought not fit to make a large Treatiſe on each of theſe Heads, but anſwered what he propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a ſutable ſuccinctneſs; If he had then thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, or had imagined that ſo large a Book as our Author's, would have been built on this Paſſage, he would have made the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on broader, tho' not more commodious for what this Author build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on it: He could have told him, that tho' he might be bold to venture his Credit on the <hi>Cyprianick Age,</hi> being more on our ſide than on that of our Adverſaries; And tho' our Cauſe, duely and diſtinctly ſtated, ſhould ſuffer no loſs by being tryed at that Barr, yet neither did he venture any bodies Reputation but his own, nor will he quit the more divine <hi>Letters Patents</hi> that we have for Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to reſt in this, either as our only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or our chief Strength. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of what I have now remarked concerning this Author ſnatching at a fancied Advantage againſt us, I hope to make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear that he hath wholly miſſed his Aim, and that theſe two or three Lines of my Book will ſtand againſt the ſhock of his long Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>§. 4. I thirdly obſerve that this Author, who is ſo profuſe in his Refutation of a few Lines in my Book, hath, in his own, given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>to any one who were of as ſcripturient a Diſpoſition as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) for vaſt Volums: as in his ſarcaſtick denyal of <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> P. 8. <hi>That Presbyters, in the Cyprianick Age, were ſeldom called Paſtors. P.</hi> 9. That <hi>there can be no Church without a Biſhop.</hi> P. 19. That <hi>the Biſhops Power is Monarchical.</hi> p. 22. That <hi>the Biſhops Deed is the Churches Act.</hi> p. 24. That <hi>Epiſcopacy is of Divine Inſtitution.</hi> p. 26. That <hi>he is ſubordinate to none.</hi> p. 27, 28, 35. That <hi>the Biſhop is a ſupream Eccleſiaſtical Magiſtrat.</hi> p. 43. And <hi>Majesty</hi> is aſcribed to him, <hi>Ibid.</hi> he is called a <hi>Soveraign and Peerleſs Governour.</hi> p. 65. <hi>Supream and unaccountable Power</hi> is aſcribed to him. p. 67. Theſe, and many more ſuch Aſſertions, are the Stars by which his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150243:6"/>
Treatiſes is beſpangled: And each of them might afford matter for a long Diſcourſe, to one who hath nothing elſe to do. A fourth Remark is, that through the whole courſe of his Argumentations he uſeth ſuch confidence, and theſe Pretences to concluſive and irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable evidence, as may fright an unintelligent or unwarrie Reader; while the Strength of his Ratiocinations is no way proportionable, but apparent to be built on Words rather than Matter. Every one knoweth that the Signification of ſeveral Words uſed about Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Things in <hi>Cyprian's</hi> time, was far different from what is our modern Dialect. The truth of this will, I hope, be more fully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in our conſidering his particular Arguments.</p>
            <p>§. 5. My Aſſertion againſt which his Book is levelled, he ſeemeth to wonder at, as <hi>ſtrangely raſh,</hi> and a <hi>putting our being, or not being. Schiſmaticks, on a deſperate Iſſue.</hi> The Aſſertion is, <hi>a Biſhop in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>'s <hi>time was not a Dioceſan, with ſole Power of Juriſdiction and Ordination: If he prove that, we ſhall give</hi> Cyprian, <hi>and him, leave to call us Schiſmaticks. A Biſhop, then, was the Paſtour of a Flock, or the Moderator of a Presbyterie: If he can prove that we ſeparate from our Pastours, or from the Presbytery, with their Moderator, under whoſe Inſpection we ought to be, let him call us what he will: But we diſown the Biſhops in</hi> Scotland <hi>from being our Biſhops; we can neither own their Epiſcopal Authority, nor any pastoral Relation they have to us.</hi> He ſeemeth p. 1. to divide his Book into two parts: <hi>Firſt,</hi> to <hi>take to Task what I had ſaid;</hi> to wit, the words above ſet down. 2. <hi>to add, perchance, ſomething concerning our main Argument.</hi> The firſt part he hath largely inſiſted on: with what Strength or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, I am now to examine. Of the 2, I find nothing, but that, p. 94. he hath fairly waved it; But with confidence that he could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it: and leaving to the perſon to whom he directeth this long Letter, to command him to proſecute what is left undone. The Import of which is, that it is much more his Inclination to write <hi>ad hominem,</hi> againſt a particular perſon; than <hi>ad rem,</hi> for that which he taketh to be the truth of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:150243:6"/>§. 6. His firſt work is to expoſe the above-mentioned Paſſage in my Book, as yielding <hi>a large Field, if one had a mind to catch at Words,</hi> and that <hi>it were eaſie to inſiſt on ſuch eſcapes, if one had a mind for it.</hi> His firſt Remark is, <hi>Suppoſe the word</hi> Dioceſs <hi>was not in uſe in St.</hi> Cyprian's <hi>time, as applyed to a Biſhops Diſtrict, doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the thing now ſignified by it was not then in uſe. Anſw.</hi> Pray Sir, who made that Conſequence: the Words cited (catch at them as much as you will) import no ſuch Conſequence, and deſign no more but that which we call now a <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop,</hi> with ſole Power of Juriſdiction and Ordination, was not in that Age. His next Remark is in this Queſtion, <hi>What could move him</hi> (the Author of the Paſſage now under Debate) <hi>to inſinuate that we aſſign the ſole power of Juriſdiction and Ordination to our Dioceſan Biſhop. Anſw.</hi> It is a greater wonder, what ſhould move this Author to except againſt our thinking that they aſſign ſuch Power to their Biſhop, ſeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſcribeth all that Power to the <hi>Cyprianick-Biſhop,</hi> and affirmeth him to be of <hi>Divine Inſtitution;</hi> as hath been already obſerved: Hath he not ſaid, that <hi>the Biſhops Power is Monarchial,</hi> pag. 23, 32. and expreſly, <hi>pag.</hi> 38. near the end he ſaith, <hi>the Biſhop had the ſole Power of Ordination:</hi> and ſaith, <hi>it hath been frequently and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved by learned men, that he need not inſiſt on it:</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 39. tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us of <hi>Cyprian's Ordaining without asking the conſent of the Clergy or People:</hi> and pleading for this as the <hi>Right of all Biſhops.</hi> If he do not aſcribe this ſole Power to his <hi>Scots-Biſhops,</hi> then (<hi>ex tuo ore</hi>) they are not the <hi>Biſhops that Christ inſtituted:</hi> Nor theſe of <hi>the Cypria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick-Age;</hi> nor <hi>theſe for whom the learned men that he ſpeaketh of, hath pleaded:</hi> neither can I gueſs what kind of <hi>Animals</hi> he will make them: they muſt be a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Biſhops that never man pleaded for but himſelf. I ſuppoſe his Lords the Biſhops will give him ſmall thanks thus for pleading their Cauſe. What I have now obſerved, ſheweth his Queſtions to be impertinent, <hi>viz. When did our Biſhops claim that Power, and when was it aſcribed to them by this Conſtitution? When did they exerciſe it? When was it thought neceſſary for raiſing a Biſhop to all the due Elevations of the Epiſcopal Authority?</hi> I give this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150243:7"/>
Anſwer to all theſe Queſtions: our <hi>Scots</hi> Biſhops look on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are lookt on by their Underlings, and by this Author, as <hi>Scripture-Biſhops;</hi> or at leaſt, as <hi>Primitive-Biſhops,</hi> and the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops that the learned men of this, and the preceeding Ages have pleaded for:</hi> but our Author ſaith theſe had the Power we now ſpeak of: and therefore he muſt ſay, that that Power <hi>was given them by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;</hi> that <hi>they do claim it,</hi> and <hi>ought to claim it, that it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for their due Elevation.</hi> If they ſhun to exerciſe it, at leaſt openly, by not laying on of Hands without Presbyters; it is becauſe they know that practice cannot take, nor be born with in a Nation where Parity hath been ſo much known, and generally liked: I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways underſtood that the main thing debated between us and the Prelatiſts, was about the <hi>ſole Power of Juriſdiction and Ordination:</hi> and I am not alone in this; the <hi>Synod of</hi> London, <hi>Vindication of Presbyterial Government;</hi> pag. 24. propoſeth the Controverſie in the ſame Words. So doth alſo <hi>Smectymnus,</hi> §. 8, 9. and I think he will not find many (if any one) of either ſide, who handleth this Controverſie without reſpect to this Power. To his Queſtion, <hi>When was it aſcribed to them by the Conſtitution:</hi> I Anſwer, it was done, with reſpect <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Ordination, <hi>anno</hi> 1635, in the <hi>Canons and Conſtitutions Eccleſiastical,</hi> chap. 2. §. 3. where the Examination of the Candidate (and conſequently the Power of determining who ſhal be ordained) is laid on the Biſhop: and he is allowed to perform this Examination by himſelf, or his Chaplain. And for <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> a perſon ordained to a Charge may not Preach, unleſs he be alſo licenſed by the Biſhop, <hi>ibid. chap.</hi> 7. §. 5 Nor may he refute Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror preached by another, unleſs he firſt ask and obtain leave of the Biſhop, <hi>ibid.</hi> §. 7. Yea, a Presbyter may not go a Journey for ſome time, without the Biſhops leave: nor ſtay unduly at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but he muſt be cenſured by the Biſhop; <hi>chap.</hi> 4. §. 3, 5. And in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in all theſe <hi>Canons,</hi> all Church-Diſcipline is laid on the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; that is the Biſhop: not a word of Cenſure inflicted by the Presbyters. Without the Biſhop no Miniſter may appoint a Faſt; not in his own Congregation, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. and <hi>chap.</hi> 18. §. 10. The
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150243:7"/>
Sentence of Deprivation of a Presbyter is pronounced only by the Biſhop: no conſent of Presbyters is ſought; only the preſence of three or four, whom the Biſhop calleth, is required.</p>
            <p>§. 7. The import of the diſtinctions he uſeth for illuſtrating this Matter muſt be, that our <hi>Scots</hi>-Biſhops have in <hi>Juriſdiction and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, a chief Power, tho' not a ſole Power: a Power ſuperior to, but not excluſive of other Powers: a Power without, and againſt which no Power can act; but not a Power deſtroying and diſabling all other Powers.</hi> We ſhould better have underſtood him if he had opened the terms of theſe Diſtinctions: I confeſs, <hi>qui bene diſtinguit bene do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,</hi> but not <hi>qui obſcurè diſtinguit.</hi> I obſerve none of theſe Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons clear to us, whether he thinketh our Biſhops can Ordain, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the concurrence of Presbyters, acting authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively with them: as he alledgeth the <hi>Cyprianick-Biſhops</hi> might do: and ſeing he doth not determine this, I know not what his Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſerve for, but to make a noiſe with Words. His firſt diſtinction between <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>ſole Power,</hi> if <hi>eaſily made</hi> (as he ſaith) is not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily applyed to the caſe in hand: for our Queſtion is about <hi>ſole Power,</hi> and if he deny that to them, whatever other Power he give them, he maketh them no ſuch Biſhops as he after pleadeth for. Beſide, the word <hi>chief</hi> is ambiguous; it may be taken either for Dignity, that the Biſhop's Power tho' the ſame with the Presbyters, yet is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous becauſe of the dignity of the Biſhops perſon or office: or that the Biſhop can do ſome acts of Power which the Presbyter cannot do: or that the Presbyter's Power is derived from the Biſhop, or that he cannot exerciſe it unleſs the Biſhop pleaſeth: The firſt Senſe, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe will not pleaſe our Biſhops, for it importeth no Imparity of Power. In all the other Senſes, the Biſhop's Power <hi>is ſole;</hi> at leaſt as to theſe things about which he hath that Power. His ſecond Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is the ſame, in different words: the third differeth little; for if Presbyters cannot act except the Biſhop pleaſe, and if they muſt follow his Light, whatever be their own, I ſee not what Power they have. What Power is given to our Biſhops by their Conſtitution, I ſhall not farther determine; but it may be made appear, that they have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150243:8"/>
exerciſed, and conſequently claimed a Power over whole Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, which maketh void all their Power, while they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to deſiſt from proceeding to Cenſure Scandalous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders; of which I can give Inſtances. His third and laſt Remark is, that <hi>that part of my Definition of a Biſhop is looſe and ambiguous, wherein I call him the Paſtour of a Flock:</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>may not a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and his Dioceſs be called a Paſtour and his Flock, as well as a Presbyterian Miniſter and his Pariſh? Anſw.</hi> He might eaſily have underſtood my words in our ordinary Dialect, now in uſe; and then all Ambiguity had evaniſhed: but I cannot make him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand my words unleſs he will: we uſe not to call a Biſhops Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs the Flock, nor him the Paſtour: nor did Scripture ſo uſe theſe terms; ſeing the Paſtour is to feed the Flock, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. which he muſt do, not only by Ruling, but alſo by Teaching; which I am ſure a Biſhop cannot to his Dioceſs. That a Biſhop in our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern ſenſe, was called the Paſtour, and ſuch a Dioceſs as ours, his Flock, in <hi>Cyprian's</hi> time, we deny: and ſhall conſider his Proofs of this, when he ſhall propoſe them. I have run over his <hi>large field,</hi> and find not what fruit he hath reaped from it: nor the eſcapes that he thinketh it ſo eaſy to inſiſt on, <hi>p.</hi> 2. at the end.</p>
            <p>§. 8. In the ſenſe he giveth of what I had aſſerted, which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth upon, <hi>p.</hi> 3. I have little to obſerve: for I am ready to maintain all that he there maketh to be my Opinion; except, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat he ſaith, that <hi>in the Presbyterian ſenſe, a Moderator, as ſuch, is no Church-Governour;</hi> which I cannot agree to: but becauſe he hath this over again, and improves againſt us that Notion, (which is his own, none of ours,) <hi>p.</hi> 35, 36. I ſhall there conſider it, <hi>viz.</hi> §. 20. It is true, the <hi>Vindication of Ch. of S. in Anſwer to the the ten Questions, Q.</hi> 1. §. 5. Saith, <hi>that a Moderator as ſuch, is no Church-Governour;</hi> but it is evident to any who impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth what is there ſaid, that no more is meant, but that he is not a Church-Governour of another <hi>Species</hi> from the reſt, or who hath another ſort of Authority than they, or a Superior Power to them: not, as our Author would improve it, that it is not needful
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150243:8"/>
that he hath the ſame Church Power with the reſt; but <hi>may be a Heathen,</hi> as he affirmeth, <hi>p.</hi> 35, 36. Alſo becauſe he inferreth from what I had ſaid, that my Opinion is, that in <hi>Cyprian's time, the Church was governed by Presbyters Acting in Parity, after the Presbyterian Model, p.</hi> 4. It will be needful, before I examine his Arguments, to give a more full and diſtinct Account of my thoughts in this Matter, than is done in that ſhort hint which his whole Book is imployed againſt: and this is the rather needful, becauſe my Antagoniſt doth not ſo plainly as were to be wiſht, ſtate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, when he ſaith; <hi>p. 4. If I ſhall prove, firſt, that a Biſhop in</hi> Cyprian's <hi>time, was more than the Paſtour of a Flock or Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of a Presbytery, in the Presbyterian ſenſe. 2. That he had real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Genuine Epiſcopal or Prelatick Power. 3. That he Acted in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Superiority over, not in Parity with Paſtours; our Author is bound to acknowledge himſelf and his Brethren to be Schiſmaticks.</hi> I ſhall ſtate the Queſtion a little more diſtinctly; but not diſown any of the Terms in which he hath put the Queſtions, all which three, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but one Queſtion.</p>
            <p>§. 9. Let it then be conſidered firſt, that we never thought, nor ſaid, that Church-Government was in all it's Modes and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the third Century, (in which <hi>Cyprian</hi> lived) the ſame with what it is now among <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyterians: the Subſtance of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may remain, and yet conſiderable Alterations be made in the Modes of mannaging it, in the Succeſſion of Years; much more of Ages: We confeſs many words relating to Church-Offices, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and Adminiſtrations, ſignified another thing then, than they do in our Modern Dialect: theſe we call Moderators, and my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt calleth Biſhops, were then conſtant; among us they ſerve in that Station but for ſome ſmall time, and give place to others: in the <hi>Affrican</hi> Church theſe they called <hi>Primates,</hi> (whom yet we deny to have had either Sole, or Superior Juriſdiction) were the eldeſt Miniſter of every Province; which afterward was changed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they choſen according to their Perſonal Qualifications: and <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans</hi> were the Biſhops of the chief Cities; which had no Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150243:9"/>
Power; but only ſometimes praeſided in Synods. <hi>Cyprian</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned that any of them was <hi>Epiſcopus Epiſcoporum.</hi> See <hi>no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for Dioceſan Churches or Biſhops, p.</hi> 28. Alſo <hi>L' Arroque ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſar. Sacr. Lib. 2. C.</hi> 14. maketh this plain. And <hi>Leidecker. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. de ſtatu Eccleſ. Affric.</hi> §. 7. he ſheweth that <hi>Primates</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Metropolitans</hi> in Dignity, and that they firſt attained that Degree by their Age, reckoning it from their Ordination: and the other from the City where they had their Charge. Yea there hath been no Age of Old, or in later times, in which there have not been ſome leſſer differences in Management, even among Churches which uſed the ſame <hi>Species</hi> of Church-Government, for Subſtance: as at this day, in <hi>Scotland, Low-Countries, Geneva,</hi> among the <hi>Switzers; &amp;c.</hi> Some Churches are more and ſome leſs pure, and near to the Pattern: and yet all governed by Presbyters Acting in Parity: and among the Prelatiſts, Prelatick Power is higher in one Church than in another; as in <hi>England</hi> now, and in <hi>Scotland</hi> of late? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Author muſt not think to triumph, if he can ſhew ſome difference between the <hi>Cyprianick</hi> Age, and our Way. <hi>Cypr. Ep. 75. §. 5. Firmilian</hi> writing to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> hath Inſtances to ſhew, that <hi>in diverſe Churches, they had diverſe Practices, and yet kept Peace, one with another.</hi> 2. We deny not that in <hi>Cyprian's</hi> time, there was ſome Advances made towards ſome ſort of Prelacy; tho' the Parity of Power was not then wholly taken away: as the <hi>Myſtery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> in other things, ſo in that, did begin early <hi>to Work</hi> even in the days of the Apoſtles, when <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, affected to be <hi>primus Presbyter,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Moderator,</hi> in their Meetings: and this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> becoming fixed, and conſtant after the Apoſtles times, (theſe good Men not fore-ſeeing the ill Uſe that others would make of that Handle given them) it did, by inſenſible Degrees, degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into an undue Uſurpation: (as it is hard to get Power kept within it's due Bounds, even among the beſt men) and the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power of Presbyters, was gradually wreſted out of their hands, by the Ambition of ſome, and by the innocent Simplicity of others. Many other Corruptions had crept into the Church by that time, and this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150243:9"/>
Declenſion from abſolute parity went along with them: the name <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> began to be appropriat to the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and that Cuſtom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirmed by a little time, made even humble men imagine, that ſome different Power was ſignified by that name, that they had diſtinct from others; which the reſt, who were ſo uſurped upon, did too eaſily yield; minding more the Work of Feeding, than of Ruling the Flock: and not ſeeing the fatal Conſequents of it, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appeared, and were not diſcovered, till it was too late to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve them. 3. It is evident from the Hiſtory of the firſt Ages, that as Epiſcopacy did not arrive to it's height of a ſudden; ſo it was not at the ſame time ſettled in all the places where it obtained at laſt: the Ambition of ſome, or at leaſt their too big Thoughts of the Power that belonged to them, and the Eaſyneſs of their Com-Presbyters, made it in one place make quicker Advances, while the Humility, and ſound Judgment of others, together with the Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy of theſe who with them govern'd the Church, retarded it's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in other Churches.

Hence we may conclude, that our Author cannot prove what he pretendeth, unleſs he make it appear, that Epiſcopal Power, (ſuch as he pleadeth for) was not only acted by ſome, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, in the Churches of the firſt, ſecond, and third Centuries; or approved by general Conſent. Wherefore, if we can bring Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to prove a Parity of Power among Presbyters, and that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination over them by one was condemned; his bringing ſome Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies to the contrary, will not be found concludent. I ſay not this, as if I were afraid he can prove what he undertaketh, by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150243:10"/>
Authentick Suffrage of any one of the Fathers of the firſt three Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies: but that he may ſee what Weakneſs and Fallacy is in his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings on more Accounts than one. I may here add a Conjecture, on which the Reader ſhall be deſired to lay no more Weight than he pleaſeth: that, ſeing it is confeſſed by the beſt Antiquaries, that we have but little Hiſtorical Certainty of the firſt Ages of the Church, it is probable that more Oppoſition might be made to the Tendency toward Church-Domination, than we have account of: for the Topping Party might carry all before them, and others might be ſuppreſſed, or what they did, buried in ſilence: eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that meek men are often too apt, rather to ſuppreſs their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than to make much noiſe with them, to the hazarding of the Peace of the Church: and to groan under Grievances, rather than caſt the Church into a Convulſion by ſtruggling; when they do not foreſee the greatneſs of the hazard that they fear. This, I conceive, may be one part of that <hi>Sleep,</hi> that giveth the <hi>Enemy</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage <hi>to ſow his Tares.</hi> I ground this Conjecture on the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that is between the Scripture-account of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that of after Ages; and that the further we come down from the Scripture-times, the difference ſeemeth to be the greater; and yet we have but often, ſmall account of any ſenſible Change made at any one time.</p>
            <p>§. 11. The Learned Author, to his <hi>main Proofs</hi> (as he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>p.</hi> 4.) premitteth a <hi>ſhrewd Preſumption</hi> againſt what I hold: that <hi>generally, the great Champions for Presbytery acknowledge that Epiſcopacy was in the Church long before</hi> Cyprian's <hi>time:</hi> and he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>Chamier, Blondel, Salmaſius,</hi> the Synod of <hi>London, Spanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi> &amp;c. What his <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may contain in it's vaſt belly, I know not, but I am not afraid of any of them he hath mentioned; they are all Friends to the Cauſe I maintain, and ſay no more than I have already ſaid; but much againſt his Sentiments. It had been eaſier for me to make this appear, if he had thought fit to point at the Books, or Places of them, on which he groundeth his Aſſertion; for ſome of theſe Authors have written much: however I hope to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150243:10"/>
find out in them what is ſufficient to my purpoſe. I begin with <hi>Chamier;</hi> who, <hi>Panſtrat. Catholic. Tom. 2. Lib.</hi> 10. diſcourſeth on this Subject copiouſly: but I find not one word in him, aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that in the firſt three Centuries, Biſhops had the Rule of the Church above Presbyters, further than that they were above them in Dignity, and by a Priority of Order; not of Juriſdiction: far leſs that they had the <hi>ſole Juriſdiction,</hi> which our Author preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to prove. On the contrary, that Learned Writer proveth, <hi>C.</hi> 3. that there was no Domination allowed in the Church, <hi>C.</hi> 5. that the Government of the ſeveral Churches was <hi>Ariſtocratical:</hi> and he ſheweth that all Presbyters at firſt were equal; but that afterward, (as he citeth <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Jerome) unus electus eſt, qui omnium primus eſſet, &amp; Epiſcopus diceretur.</hi> And on this he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth two Obſerves: Firſt, <hi>in Eccleſiae Primordiis, nullos tales Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copos fuiſſe, qui poſtea inſtituti fuere, qui ſuo jure reliquis è Clero prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſent.</hi> And he thence inferreth the abſolute Parity of Presbyters, <hi>de Jure.</hi> His ſecond Obſervation is, <hi>ne tunc quidem, cum hic E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcoporum a Presbyteris diſtinctorum ordo eſt constitutus, fuiſſe Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copos ut Monarchas,</hi> (ſee how he agreeth with our Author, <hi>p. 23, 32.) qui poteſtatem haberent in Clerum; ſed Principes Electos, qui rebus deliberandis praeeſſent, ut neceſſe est in omni Ariſtocratia.</hi> Where he ſeemeth exactly to deſcribe a Moderator, ſuch as is in our Presbyteries, and other Church Judicatories.

            <p>§. 14. He proceedeth (<hi>pag.</hi> 5.) to his other Arguments. His firſt Argument (which he manageth to <hi>pag.</hi> 11.) is built on three Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, or Pillars; the firſt is, that <hi>every Church was, in</hi> Cyprian'<hi>s time, ruled by a Biſhop, Presbyters and Deacons.</hi> This I deny not: only I obſerve a few things: one is, that our Controverſie is not about the Name Biſhop, being appropriat to one and not given in common to all the Presbyters, as at firſt; but about that Biſhop, or firſt Presbyter's Power;; which this his Diſcourſe doth not touch. Another thing that I obſerve is, that it cannot be denyed that the Deacons, in that Age, and may be ſooner, had more Hand in the Government of the Church than was allowed by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution; by which they were only Servants, not Rulers; and their work was only about the Poor. I thirdly obſerve our Author's unwarrineſs, in here aſſerting that the Church was ruled by Biſhops, Presbyters, and Deacons; and yet he pleadeth for the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150243:13"/>
Biſhops ſole Juriſdiction, in moſt of his Book: This I impute to want of a good memory. What he hath <hi>p.</hi> 6. of <hi>Superinducing a Biſhop where one already was,</hi> and <hi>that there could be but one Biſhop in a Church,</hi> will after fall in to be conſidered: where he inſiſteth more directly and fully on it. His ſecond ground that his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is built on, is, that <hi>the Presbyters in that Age were Preaching-Presbyters, and not Ruling-Elders, ſuch as we have in the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Church.</hi> That the Biſhop in that Age was diſtinct even from Preaching-Elders, or Miniſters, we deny not; and that there were many ſuch where was but one Biſhop, we acknowledge: ſo it is with us; there are many Miniſters where there is but one Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, and many Ruling-Elders, where there is but one Miniſter or Parochial Biſhop. What ſort of Officers in the Church the Presbyters, diſtinguiſhed from the Biſhop were, in the Primitive times, is controverted among ſome: Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> held that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Biſhops were of Divine Inſtitution, and were in the Apoſtolick-Church; the conſequent of which is, that Presbyters muſt be a device of men and brought in afterward: this is ſolidly refuted by the learned Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> on <hi>Revelation,</hi> ch. 3. p. (<hi>mihi</hi>) 230. The Author of the Book Intituled, <hi>An Inquiry into the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the Primitive-Church in the first 300 years,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth that this work is done <hi>by an impartial Hand,</hi> he alſo hath a like Notion, <hi>p.</hi> 72. and maintaineth that <hi>Presbyters are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the Conſtitution of a Church; that they are equal to a Biſhop in Order; and have all the Power that he hath; but inferior in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; that they were ordained Preachers; but had no particular Charge; but were imployed by the Biſhop in any piece of Church-work, as he thought fit, and ſo were his Curats, or Aſſiſtants.</hi> But of this afterward. I deny not that there were Presbyters in the third Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, ſuch as our Author contendeth for, that is perſons authoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preach the Goſpel and adminiſter the Sacraments, diſtinct from Biſhops.

            <p>§. 16. It is yet more fully againſt this Author's bold Aſſertion, that even in <hi>Cyprian's</hi> time it ſelf, this Office was in the Church; as Witneſs the Writers of that Age, <hi>Baſil. in Pſal. 33.

tanquam Manus, ut Diaconi;</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Optat. Milevit. Lib. 1. adv. Parmen.</hi> telleth us of certain precious Utenſils of the Church, which in a time of Perſecution, could neither ſafely be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor hid in the Earth; and therefore they were committed to the Cuſtody of the faithful Elders of the Church. From all this it is evident, that if expreſs and diſtinct mention be not made of this ſort of Elders by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> it is either becauſe he had no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; or that he comprehended them under the general name of Presbyters, as the Scripture ſometimes doth under the name of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: for it is not to be imagined that <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in this, was of a different Sentiment from the Church, before, in, and after his time.</p>
            <p>§. 7. His third Foundation for his Argument is, that <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Power, Authority, Pastoral Relation, extended to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans within his District:</hi> and a little after, <hi>the Biſhops Prelation, what ever it was, related not ſolely to the Clergy, nor ſolely to the Laity; but to both equally and formally:</hi> this we are no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to oppoſe; for we think every Miniſter hath a Relation to the Univerſal Church, and Authority with Reſpect to all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it: and more particularly within the Presbytery whereof he is a Member: and yet more fully toward theſe of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he is ſet in, whether Elders or People. Neither is our Queſtion about the Extent of the Biſhop's Power, as to Perſons, ſo much as about the Solitude of this Power; whether Church Power reſide in his Perſon alone, or be in the Community of Presbyters. I might diſmiſs this whole Section; but that his Proofs ſeem not ſo much levelled at this Concluſion; as at ſome other things which we cannot ſo eaſily comply with: he telleth us of <hi>Cyprian's defining the Church, to be a People united to the Prieſt, and a Flock adhering to their Pastour:</hi> he bringeth Citations to prove, that <hi>where a Biſhop is wanting, the People hath no Ruler, the Flock no Paſtour, the Church no Governour, Chriſt no Prelate, and God no Prieſt:</hi> and he will have Presbyters to be but <hi>Vice-Paſtours.</hi> Now how far is all this from his Concluſion; <hi>viz.</hi> that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150243:15"/>
the Biſhop's Power extendeth to all the People? All this tendeth to prove the Biſhop's ſole Juriſdiction, which is afterward to be conſidered, where he inſiſteth on that point on purpoſe: but here here he doth nothing but make a Parade with a parcel of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Citations: I ſhall only now tell him; that this may be well underſtood of a Pariſh Biſhop or Miniſter. For Presbyters being <hi>Vice-Pastours,</hi> that is afterward anſwered. Wherefore I now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his Application of his three Concluſions to what he would prove; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>a Biſhop in</hi> Cyprian's <hi>time, was neither the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour of a Flock, nor the Moderator of a Presbytery; in my ſenſe of the terms: not the first for</hi> Cyprian <hi>at</hi> Carthage, Cornelius <hi>at</hi> Rome, &amp;c. <hi>had many ſuch Paſtours under them: yea, it was ſo over all the World. Not the ſecond; becauſe a Presbyterian Moderator as ſuch, is no Church Governour at all: hath no direct, immediat, formal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the People, but only to the Presbytry.</hi> This is the goodly Argument in which our Author early triumpheth, as ſufficient, if there were no more, to ruine our Cauſe.</p>
            <p>§. 18. This Triumph will be found to be before the Victory: That I may give a full and direct Anſwer to his Argument, I muſt diſtinguiſh what our Author confoundeth, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſignification of the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the Apoſtles time, it ſignified any ruling, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Officer in the Church: hence <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. all Church-Officers are ſo called, except the Deacons. And 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle giveth Directions to all the Ruling-Officers in the Church, and then <hi>verſ. 8, &amp;c.</hi> telleth what manner of Men the Deacons ſhould be. If the Apoſtle had known any other ordinary Church-Officers, theſe Canons had been very lame: and indeed it is no wonder that the Biſhops (not being here comprehended) do what they will; for we know no Scripture, rules neither for their Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, nor Work: and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5, and 6. the Elders that were to be ſet up in every City are called Biſhops, <hi>v.</hi> 7. the ſame Word in after Ages, as it was ſometimes given to Paſtours of particular Congregations, ſo it was ordinarily given to the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the <hi>primus Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Moderator</hi> in the Colledge of Presbyters: and the ſame
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150243:15"/>
that ſuſtained the later of theſe Relations had alſo the former, and laboured in the Word and Doctrine, and managed Congregational-Diſcipline in a particular Pariſh, taking the Word Pariſh in our modern ſenſe. Wherefore if the Citations he bringeth for Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Power can rationally be applyed to either of theſe Notions of a Biſhop, our Cauſe is ſafe from his Aſſaults. That the Moderator of the Colledge of Presbyters is called Biſhop, not only is evident from <hi>Jerom, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nus è Presbyteris electus eſt qui caeteris ſuperponeretur—E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopi noverint ſe magis conſuetudine quam diſpoſitionis dominicae ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate, Presbyteris eſſe majores, &amp; in communi debere Eccleſiam regere:</hi> but this Author cannot deny it; tho' he pleadeth for an extravagant Power to that his Moderator; about which Power I now debate with him.</p>
            <p>§. 19. That the Paſtour of a particular Flock was alſo (in the Primitive Times) called a Biſhop, is certain from this, that the Scriptures dividing the Church-Officers in Biſhops and Deacons, are by the Fathers ſo applyed: as I have ſhewed elſewhere. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we find Biſhops in ſmall Villages, where were no number of Paſtors, over whom the Biſhop might praeſide: as is fully proved by the learned Mr. <hi>Clarkson, Primitive Epiſcopacy ſtated,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>c. 2. p.</hi> 19, &amp;c. and that by multitudes of Inſtances, as alſo Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Fathers, aſſerting it to be then uſual, <hi>Sozomen Hist. l. 7. c.</hi> 19. telleth us that in <hi>Arabia</hi>

Yet do I not joyn with Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi> in the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his Book. Theſe two Notions of a Biſhop being familiar in the Primitive Times, it is no wonder if we find the Fathers, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeaking of a Biſhop in the one Senſe, and ſometimes in the other.</p>
            <p>§. 20. I now Anſwer his Argument: a Biſhop in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time was always the Paſtor of a particular Flock, and Moderator in the Conſiſtory of Ruling-Elders; but ſometimes he was alſo the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of a Colledge of Presbyters; and ſo might have many Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters under him; that is, he was above them in Dignity; and we deny not but that by reaſon of his fixation in that Office, he by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom had crept into ſome more Power over them than was due: but that in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, he had the ſole Power of Juriſdiction, and Ordination, or ſuch Authority as our <hi>Dioceſans</hi> pretend to; I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny. For the other part of his Argument, that he could not be a <hi>Moderator, becauſe a Moderator as ſuch, hath no Church Power, nor is a Church Governour.</hi> I Anſwer firſt; the Aſſertion he here reflecteth on, cited by him <hi>pag.</hi> 3. that a <hi>Moderator, as ſuch, hath no Church Power,</hi> was not meant, that there might be a Moderator who hath no Church Power, and ſo taking As <hi>ſpecificative:</hi> as he abſurdly improveth it, <hi>p.</hi> 36. affirming <hi>that a Heathen may be the Moderator of a Presbytery without repugnancy to any Principle of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, tho' not without indecency and inconvenience.</hi> I ſay this is a moſt abſurd Aſſertion, both becauſe a Heathen Moderator could not underſtand the Affairs of the Church; And becauſe he would emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſse them: and becauſe it is againſt common ſenſe, and the Sentiments of Mankind, that an Enemy of the true Religion ſhould have the Conduct, and main hand in mannaging the Affairs that do ſo nearly concern it: Yea, this his Aſſertion contradicteth it ſelf: for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150243:16"/>
he acknowledgeth that this were Indecent and Inconvenient, and I hope he will not deny, that it is a Principle of the Chriſtian Religion, that <hi>all things be done Decently, and in Order:</hi> and that both Nature and Religion require, that we ſhould ſhun what is <hi>inconvenient,</hi> eſpecially to ſo high Concernments as are theſe of Religion. That Aſſertion then, that he aimeth at, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>reduplicative;</hi> that is, that a Moderator acquireth no Church Power by his being Moderator, above what he had as a Paſtor of the Church: and here a Sub-diſtinction is to be uſed, he acquireth indeed an <hi>Ordinative Power,</hi> in that he ordereth the Meeting to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Confuſion, and many call it <hi>pre re natâ;</hi> but he acquireth no <hi>Deciſive Power:</hi> he getteth a Power to be their <hi>Mouth,</hi> not <hi>their Will, or Commanding Faculty: to keep Order in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what cometh before them, not to Determine what is Debated among them,</hi> as it is expreſſed in the place he citeth; and which might have prevented this Cavil, if he had heeded what was ſaid. To conclude what I have to Reply to this his Argument, it is no Proof of ſuch a Prelacy in <hi>Cyprian's</hi> time as he pleadeth for, that it related to the Laity, as well as the Clergy: for ſo doth that of our <hi>Moderator:</hi> that is, he ordereth the Affairs which concern them, which are managed in the Presbytery: and that <hi>Cyprian</hi> did more, or, that he managed the Affairs concerning the Laity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſame Authoritative Concurrence of the Presbyters, is the Queſtion, and is not concluded by this Argument.</p>
            <p>§. 21. He undertaketh, <hi>p. 11. eaſily to collect another Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> againſt my Notion of a Biſhop, <hi>from the way, how in</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian's <hi>time, he was promoted to his Chair; to that Sublime Top of the Prieſthood,</hi> as he calleth it. This is to fright us with big, bur empty Words: if he bring a concludent probable Argument, tho' ſhort of a <hi>Demonstration,</hi> we muſt ſtoop. To <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Words, <hi>the Sublime Top of Prieſthood,</hi> I ſhould not doubt to give a ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Anſwer, if I could find the place, and conſider the purpoſe he is ſpeaking of; but my Antagoniſt hath made my Work very difficult; not by the ſtrength of his Arguments, but by leaving me
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150243:17"/>
at uncertainty where to find any one of his Citations, unleſs I ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtumble on them caſually, or read all <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Epiſtles for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place that is cited: for he knoweth there are ſeveral Editions of <hi>Cyprian;</hi> and he hath neither told what Edition he uſeth, (I have no other at preſent, but that Printed by <hi>Le Preux,</hi> 1593.) nor nameth he to whom the Epiſtle is Directed: whether this be done <hi>de industriâ,</hi> or not, I ſhall not judge: but I am ſure it is a great neglect: eſpecially conſidering that <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Epiſtles are quite otherways numbred by <hi>Scultetus,</hi> than in the Edition menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, but I find neither of theſe can help me to find his Citations. All that I ſhall ſay about this <hi>Sublimity</hi> he talketh of, is, that the Fathers uſed to ſpeak big words concerning the Goſpel Miniſtry; which both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Prelatiſts</hi> have abuſed: alſo the Biſhops Power was elevated to a higher Dignity, tho' not greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than the Presbyters, and that was their <hi>Sublime Faſtigium Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotii.</hi> This his Argument alſo, he buildeth on ſeveral Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. The firſt is, <hi>There could be no lawful Promotion to a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick, where a Biſhop had been ſetled, unleſs there were a clear, Canonical, and unqueſtionable Vacancy: it was a received Maxim then, that there could be but one Biſhop at once in a Church.</hi> Our preſent Debate is no way concerned in this Principle, whether it be true or falſe. For taking a Biſhop for Moderator; we think there ſhould be but one at one time: and that another ought not to be choſen till the place be void, by Death, Depoſition from that Office, or Ceſſion. If by Biſhop you underſtand the <hi>Paſtor of a Flock,</hi> whether there be one or more over a Congregation, is nothing to our purpoſe; ſeing the Queſtion is about the Power of the Biſhop, whether it be in one, or more Perſons.</p>
            <p>§. 22. Yet I ſhall obſerve a few things on his Diſcourſe of this his Principle. 1. If I were willing to be very critical, I would ask him, what did they in thoſe days, when there was a <hi>real,</hi> and <hi>lawful Vacancy;</hi> but not <hi>clear,</hi> nor <hi>unqueſtionable;</hi> as in the Conteſt between <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Novatianus</hi> at <hi>Rome:</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtances that might be given, of moſt Unchriſtian, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150243:17"/>
Bloody Contentions, between Biſhops pretending to the ſame See: I hope the ſound Party might, and did place a Biſhop; tho' the Vacancy was queſtioned. Next I oppoſe to his Principle, Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> on <hi>Rev. 11. p.</hi> 662. who telleth us, <hi>there were two Biſhops at once in</hi> Jeruſalem, Antioch, Epheſus, <hi>and</hi> Rome, he nameth them: and giveth Reaſons why diſtinct Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under their reſpective Biſhops in each City were neceſſary: he ſaith alſo it was ſo in other Cities: and his Reaſons do prove that it muſt be ſo in all Cities: where there are many People. I inſiſt not on the Biſhops at <hi>Philippi,</hi> Phil. 1. 1. At <hi>Epheſus,</hi> whom the Holy Ghoſt had made Biſhops, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 20. Thirdly, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that all the Citations he here bringeth, hath this Tendency, to ſhew that <hi>Novatus</hi> in intruding himſelf in the Biſhop's See at <hi>Rome,</hi> was to be blamed, ſeing <hi>Cornelius</hi> was already duly ſetled in that Place. This was a plain Caſe, the Presbyters and People of <hi>Rome</hi> had choſen <hi>Cornelius</hi> to be Paſtor of a Flock, and their conſtant Moderator, as was the Practice of that Time: <hi>Novatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was not only unſound in other things, but he got a Faction to chooſe him for Paſtor and their Moderator, and he with them, ſet up another <hi>Presbytery,</hi> in Oppoſition to that wherein <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was fixed: I know no Presbyterian who would not condemn this Practice as much as <hi>Cyprian</hi> did: and it is obſervable that the Citations here brought by our Author, do not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Unity of a Biſhop; as the Unity of a Church, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Novatianus</hi> had broken: I confeſs <hi>Cyprian</hi> here uſed Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions a little too vehement, in that he not only denyeth them who make ſuch Rents to be <hi>Paſtors,</hi> being unduly Choſen, and Ordained; but denyeth them to be <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> it was a great Sin,, and deſerved the higheſt Cenſure; but it is hard to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian all who make a Schiſm: but I impute this Fervor to the Temper of that Age, rather than of the Holy and Meek <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian:</hi> and it is like, theſe Wiſe Men ſaw a peculiar Reaſon at that time, for thus Oppoſing the Seeds of Ruine to the Church, which often lurk unobſerved in Schiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:150243:18"/>§. 23. His ſecond pillar of this Argument is this Aſſertion; <hi>there was no canonical vacancy but where the Biſhop whoſe the Chair had been was dead, had ceded, or was canonically depoſed.</hi> Let this paſs. The third is, <hi>when a See was thus canonically vacant, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of that province met, chooſed and ordained one in preſence of the people whom he was to govern.</hi> I object nothing againſt this, ſave that the Biſhops chooſed the Man to be ordained: we ſay the People had the choice, with the Elderſhip: but this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie he waveth, as not belonging to this Argument; and ſo do I. His fourth Propoſition is, that <hi>the perſon elected received new Impoſition of Hands, and new Ordination; tho' he had been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a Presbyter before:</hi> this he proſecuteth p, 14. and citeth many Teſtimonies to prove what he alledgeth: he ſaith, no <hi>doubt that each of theſe was raiſed to the Epiſcopacy by a new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination:</hi> and of <hi>Sabinus,</hi> that <hi>he was ordained by Impoſition of Hands:</hi> I deny not that even an ordained Presbyter behoved to be choſen to the Office of Biſhop, before he could exerciſe it: ſo it is with our <hi>Moderator.</hi> That there was more Solemnity in inſtalling a Biſhop then, than we uſe in making a Moderator, cannot be denyed: that was conſequential to the Biſhops being conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and for Life in that Office, and to that Prelation, or Dignity above other Presbyters that he then had. Neither ſhall I contend with him about <hi>Impoſition of Hands</hi> to have been in that caſe uſed; (tho' after ſearch, I cannot find the place he citeth) for it is well known, that in the Apoſtolick Church (and it is like it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in after Ages) <hi>Impoſition of Hands</hi> was uſed when Men were ſent into a ſpecial piece of Work, tho' no new Office, or new Power was given; as <hi>Act</hi> 13. 3. I hope he will not ſay, that <hi>Saul,</hi> by that Impoſition of Hands, was promoted unto a higher; or new Office, being already an Apoſtle. But our Queſtion is, whether the Biſhop had a ſuperior Power over Presbyters, which reſided in his perſon alone: this we deny, and affirm that it is not proved by the Citations he hath brought. <hi>The Zeal that even falſe Biſhops uſed to have all the Formalities in their promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150243:18"/>
that were uſed by any other</hi> (which is one of his Topicks) is as little probative; Nor ſhould I wonder if they exceeded: they had need of all the Pomp that could be, to make up the want of Real Right, to ſtrenthen their weak Title. He concludeth, p. 15. that <hi>now my Definition of a Biſhop is routed a ſecond time.</hi> Let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>§. 24. He cometh to apply his former propoſitions, and to conclude his Argument from them. <hi>How</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>can the Maxime of but one Biſhop at once conſist with the Biſhops being a ſingle Presbyter; ſeing in</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> Carthage <hi>were many Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and yet each of theſe was but one Church. Anſ.</hi> 1. It conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well with the Notion of a <hi>Moderator.</hi> 2. It conſiſteth well with the Notion of a Biſhop in leſſer places, where was no ſuch plurality of Presbyters; of which before. 3. I have ſaid enough above to diſcredit this Maxime, in the ſenſe our Author uſeth it 4. There might be a plurality of Presbyters in a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; not only Presbyters that were only ruleing, but-Preachers alſo: For it is obſerved by ſome, that in the primitive Times, they ordained many more preaching Presbyters in Churh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es than they had preſent Work for: So <hi>Mr Clerkson, primitive E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, Ch.</hi> 5. p. 93. and he buildeth on <hi>Nazianzens</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who <hi>Orat.</hi> 1.

It is probable, that then the Chriſtians having no Univerſities, the Churches, eſpecially in great Cities, or where were learned Biſhops, were Colledges for Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men to the Miniſtry, and that when they were ripe, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them and imployed them; that ſo they might be <hi>Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> out of which vacant Pariſhes might he provided: and if any will ſay, that the Biſhop had ſuch Authority over theſe Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as our <hi>Profeſſors of Divinity</hi> have over the <hi>Students,</hi> It may paſs for a probable Conjecture: Only theſe were ordained, ours we do not ordain till we fix them in Churches: and in that time I find no ſuch unordained Licentiats as we have.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:150243:19"/>§. 25. He again asketh, <hi>If a Biſhop were but a ſingle Presbyter, why ſuch a do, and ſo many Biſhops conveened to elect and ordain him.</hi> This is in part anſwered above. I add, we alſo have a Meeting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miniſters to ordain a Presbyter to a ſingle Flock: and alſo when a Moderator is choſen. As for calling Biſhops of a whole province to Elect and inſtal a Biſhop at <hi>Rome,</hi> and at <hi>Carthage,</hi> that was needful, becauſe theſe were the fixed Moderators in theſe Provinces; So our Moderator of a provincial Synod is choſen by no fewer than the Miniſters of a whole Province: and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator of the General Aſſembly by Miniſters from the whole National Church. What he ſaith about their <hi>New</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is already Anſwered. That which he calleth <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> is pretty <hi>ridiculouſly</hi> by him propoſed: <hi>Viz.</hi> that <hi>ſo much ado was made about making two men Presbyters of</hi> Rome, <hi>who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Presbyters of</hi> Rome. He meaneth <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Novatianus.</hi> It was about making them Moderators of the Colledge of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, not in <hi>Rome,</hi> but in the whole Province: and indeed it was <hi>lamentable,</hi> rather than <hi>ridiculous:</hi> Both that that Promotion began then to be more eſteemed than was meet; and was lookt on as a Prelation above the other Brethren (tho' it was far ſhort of what our Author contendeth for) and alſo that there ſhould be ſuch unchriſtian Conteſts made about it Alas ſome ſuch things have fallen out where a Dioceſan Epiſcopacy was not pretended to. Our Sentiments about <hi>a conſtant Moderator</hi> he entertaineth in ridicule, p. 16. rather than refuteth them by Arguments: this I do little regard. Had the excellent men of the <hi>Cyprianick Age</hi> ſeen, or known the fatal Conſequents of it, as we have; I judge they would not have allowed it as they did. <hi>I.</hi> refer the Reader for ſatisfaction in this Point, to Mr. <hi>Baillie, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfulneſs and danger of limited Epiſcopacy:</hi> and another peice bearing the ſame Title, which he defendeth againſt a Reply made to it. That the Presbyters of <hi>Rome</hi> did often meet during the Vacancy of the See; and that they had a Moderator in their Meetings, none will deny: but what he inferreth is in conſequential; that <hi>they might as eaſily
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150243:19"/>
have choſen a Biſhop, if he had been but Moderator.</hi> For not only the Cuſtom of having the Moderator fixed, made it more hard than to chooſe one to be their Mouth for one Meeting, or two; but alſo, (as I have ſaid) the whole Province was to be concerned in him. He argueth p. 17. in many words, <hi>if he were Moderator, why the people was to chooſe him, or why was it needful that he ſhould be choſen in their preſence. A.</hi> Becauſe alſo he was to be Paſtor of that Flock. That <hi>he was no Church-Governour as Moderator,</hi> is anſwered above: But it cannot be ſaid he was no Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour under another Relation; <hi>viz.</hi> as Paſtor of the Congregation of <hi>Rome,</hi> or a Congregation in it. That <hi>he was choſen by 16 Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. i. e.</hi> ſaith our Author, ſixteen <hi>Moderators</hi> was not then needleſs, ſeing he was to be Moderator over them to; that is over that Province. If ſixteen parochial Biſhops met to chooſe a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraror of a Presbytery, or ſixteen Moderators from ſixteen Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytries met to Elect him who was to praeſide continually in the Synod; This cannot infer either ſole or ſuperior Juriſdiction. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if we ſhould grant that in theſe days, a Preſbyterie uſed to take the help of other Presbyteries, or their Moderators, or that help was by Cuſtom impoſed on them, this will indeed prove that ſome of the Priviledges of Presbyters began then to be abridged; but not that their ruling Power in the Church was transferred on a ſingle perſon, the Biſhop. What he further argueth p. 18. from the Biſhops <hi>new Ordination,</hi> is already anſwered.</p>
            <p>§. 26. His next Argument (and ſome that follow) is taken from the <hi>Biſhops relation to his particular Church;</hi> viz. <hi>That he is the principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity to her: who ever adhered to him was in the Church, a Catholick Christian; who ſeparated from him, was out of the Church, and a Schiſmatick.</hi> Under this Head, he hath no leſs than ſix Conſiderations, which either are intended as Arguments, or ſignifie nothing. Before I come to examine theſe, I ſhall take ſome notice of his Argument, as it is here generally propoſed. And 1. I obſerve, that this very Argument is fully with as much ſtrength mannaged by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for the Pop's univerſal headſhip over the Chriſtian Church: they plead that we are not of the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150243:20"/>
are not to be reputed Chriſtians, are Dividers of Chriſt's Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe we do not adhere to the <hi>Pope,</hi> whom they hold to be the <hi>Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> to the Chriſtian Church: and the Papiſts reckon the Proteſtants as Hereticks, becauſe they do not believe this; and Schiſmaticks, becauſe they live not in Communion with the <hi>Pope,</hi> and that Church whereof he is Head. 2. This Doctrine, as it is by our Author crudely, and indiſtinctly propoſed, will Un-Church ſome of the beſt and ſoundeſt Chriſtians: for have there not been Biſhops, who had as good Title to their Sees (to ſpeak in his own Dialect,) as any could have; who afterwards turned Hereticks? How many <hi>Arian</hi> Biſhops were there, whoſe Right to their Places was not conteſted? Will he ſay that all the Orthodox who ſeparated from them, were guilty of Schiſm, and all the Aggravations that his Citations, <hi>p.</hi> 19, 20. load it with? Are we not commanded <hi>to withdraw from them who teach unſound Doctrine,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 3, 4, 5. And our Lord warnes his People againſt <hi>Wolves;</hi> and the Apoſtle gave Warning to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that <hi>of themſelves,</hi> (and our Author will ſay they were Dioceſan Biſhops,) <hi>ſhould men ariſe ſpeaking perverſe things, and drawing Diſciples after them.</hi> This Argument will prove, (if it hath any force) that theſe their Followers were the ſound Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the reſt Schiſmaticks; becauſe the one ſort adhered to their Biſhop, <hi>the Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> and the reſt departed from him. I am far from charging my Antagoniſt with owning theſe Conſequents; but I ſee not how he can ſhun the Conſequence, unleſs he retract this his inconſiderat Opinion. Thirdly, I wiſh he had explained this Term, <hi>the Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity:</hi> which he ought the rather to have done, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 18. near the end, <hi>this is a Point of great Conſequence.</hi> What he ſaith for clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, is very inſufficient: his Metaphors out of <hi>Cyprian, de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Eccleſiae;</hi> prove nothing: <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>the Sun and Beams, the Root and Branches, the Fountain and Streams:</hi> if they prove any thing, they prove more than, I ſuppoſe, our Author will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: for <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in the very page where he uſeth theſe Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150243:20"/>
(<hi>p. mihi</hi> 297.) ſpeaketh of <hi>Peter's</hi> Primacy, and placeth the Unity of the Chriſtian Church in him: <hi>tamen ut <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitatem manifeſtaret, unam Cathedram conſtituit, &amp; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitatis ejuſdem Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem ab uno incipientem ſua authoritate conſtituit: hoc erant utique &amp; caeteri Apoſtoli quod</hi> Petrus, <hi>pari conſortio praediti &amp; honoris &amp; poteſtatis, ſed exordium ab <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitate proficiſcitur.</hi> And a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>quam <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitatem firmiter tenere &amp; vindicare debemus, maxime Epiſcopi, qui in Eccleſia praeſidemus ut Epiſcopatum quoque ipſum unum atque indiviſum probemus.</hi> Where it may be obſerved, 1. That either <hi>Cyprian</hi> was abſolutely for the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Supremacy, or he had no ſuch meaning as our Author deſigneth. 2. That <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> doth not ſo much ſpeak of the Peoples adhering to their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, (which in a ſound Senſe I am for,) as Biſhops cleaving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and not breaking the Churches Peace, by Diviſions among themſelves. 3. That he is to be underſtood of a Principle of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,</hi> rather than of a Principle of <hi>Dependance:</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> firſt was in Commiſſion by Chriſt, (the truth of which I ſhall not now enquire into,) and that all were obliged to adhere to that one Doctrine that he taught: not that he had Authority over the reſt; and they muſt not Diſſent from him in any Caſe: <hi>Cyprian</hi> plainly teacheth the contrary, in that very place: that the reſt had equal Authority with him. And if we ſhould apply all this to a Biſhop, or Miniſter in a Pariſh, it amounteth to no more but this; he receiveth the Word from the Lord, and delivereth it to the People; and if they depart from this, they are Schiſmaticks, and break the Unity of the Church: which we all acknowledge. I obſerve, 4. That this his Principle is indeed <hi>of ſo great Moment,</hi> that if it be true, there are neither Churches nor Chriſtians in the World, but ſuch as owne a Dioceſan Biſhop: few in our days are Chriſtians, but theſe of the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: all the Reformed Churches muſt be Re-baptized, and their Miniſters Re-ordained: (as <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and ſome other thought of the Schiſmaticks of that time,) I hope all his Brethren are not of this Opinion. Yea it hath been condemned by the moſt famous
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150243:21"/>
of his Party. When, <hi>Anno</hi> 1610. ſome <hi>Scots</hi> Biſhops were to be Conſecrated at <hi>London,</hi> ſome moved that they might be firſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Presbyters; their Ordination without a Biſhop being null: <hi>Bancroft</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbur<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> withſtood that Motion, and told them, <hi>that thereof there was no neceſſity: ſeing where Biſhops could not be had, the Ordination given by Presbyters muſt be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med lawful: otherwiſe that it might be doubted, if there were any lawful Vocation in most of the Reformed Churches.</hi> This was Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by all the other Biſhops. <hi>Spotſwood. Hist. Lib. 7. ad An. 1610. p.</hi> 514. Whence I infer that either <hi>Cyprian</hi> was not of this Author's Opinion, nor can his Words be ſo underſtood; or that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops were oppoſite to him and <hi>Cyprian</hi> too.</p>
            <p>§. 27. What he ſaith further for clearing this his Notion about <hi>the Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> is both abſurd and groundleſs: <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>he</hi> (the Biſhop) <hi>was the Head of all the Chriſtians living within his Diſtrict, and they were one Body, one Society, one Church, by depending on him, by being ſubject to him, by keeping to his Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> I ſay this is abſurd: becauſe then Separating from the moſt Heretical Superſtitious, yea, Idolatrous Biſhop, were unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as above noted. It is alſo groundleſs; for neither <hi>Cyprian,</hi> nor any other, uſes ſuch indiſtinct, and univerſal Aſſertions in this Matter. I come to examine his ſeveral Propoſitions, by which he pretendeth to make out this his Argument. The firſt is, that <hi>the Antients highly Valued Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and laid no more Streſs on any thing than it; and no Sin they Repreſented as more Hainous, or more Criminal than the Sin of Schiſm:</hi> And here he is at the Pains to fill almoſt two Pages, with the Commendations of Unity, and hard Names given to Schiſm, out of <hi>Cyprian, Firmilian,</hi> and <hi>Concil. Carthag.</hi> I do not find that he is ſo Copious, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtereth up ſo numerous Forces againſt any Diſputable Point, as in this where he hath no Adverſary: for who ever ſpake againſt Unity in the Church, and took the Defence of Schiſm. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all this I paſs with a few ſhort Obſerves. Firſt, Tho' we have Account of ſeven ſeveral Councils at <hi>Carthage</hi> in the Antient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150243:21"/>
yet this Author always citeth <hi>Concil. Carthag.</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcrimination: if he miſcite Places, how ſhall this Error be diſcovered: for I think few will be at Pains to read over all the Acts of theſe Councils, for every one of his Citations; which are not a few. 2. We may from this Diſcourſe gather what Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments this Author hath of <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> ſeing the Deſign of his Book is to prove them Schiſmaticks; that is (according to his Citations) <hi>Renegadoes, Apoſtats, Antichriſts, Malignants, Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, falſe Christs, Christ</hi>'s <hi>Enemies, Blaſphemers, the Devils Priests, Retainers to</hi> Korah, <hi>to</hi> Judas, <hi>Villains;</hi> and much more of this Stuff. Either he Applaudeth all this, or not: if not, his Citations are impertinent; if ſo, he chargeth us with all this Guilt: and I ask him, if he thinketh it juſt, that we ſhould throw back all this Dirt on himſelf and his Party, whom we reckon to be the Authors of this Schiſm that is now in this Church: for my part, I am far from dealing ſo by them: I think they are in an Error, and that that Error miſleadeth them into ſome Practices that are ſinful, and that have bad Conſequecens to the Church; but I hope there are good men among them for all that. 3. The Schiſms that occaſioned theſe vehement Diſcourſes among the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were chiefly theſe of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Novatians;</hi> which were like to ruine Chriſtianity, and to make the World caſt at it, while it was not well ſetled, nor univerſally received. I hope our Differences tho' they have ſadder Effects, than I am willing to mention; yet go not that far. 4. It is well known that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Zeal of the Fathers, and the excellent Rhetorick they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with, made them overlaſh ſometimes in their Expreſſions: and it is evident that not a few of the Popiſh Errors had their Original, and ſome ſeeming Patrociny, from their flights of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick; their Figurative Expreſſions, and ſome Logical Niceties that they uſed. This is not my Apprehenſion alone; the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Daille, Right <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Fathers,</hi> hath the ſame Obſervation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. The Fathers themſelves were aware of this, with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the Writings of one another: <hi>Hieron. Ep. 139. ad Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150243:22"/>
Plerumque nimium diſertis accidere ſolet, ut major ſit intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiae difficultas in eorum explanationibus, quam in iis quae expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare conantur.</hi> And in Matters of greater Moment, they ſpake ſometimes unwarily, not foreſeeing what ill Uſe might be made of their Expreſſions; as <hi>Jerom</hi> alſo giveth us ground to think; <hi>Apolog. contra Ruffin. vel certe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>antequam in Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria quaſi Daemonium meridianum Arius naſceretur, innocenter quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam &amp; minus cautè locuti,—&amp; quae non poſſunt perverſorum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum calumniam declinare. Petavius</hi> maketh alſo the ſame Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, tho' a Jeſuit, <hi>in Panar. Epiphan. ad Haer.</hi> 6, 9. Yea, the ſame Author hath this Paſſage; <hi>Not. in Epiphan, multa ſunt à Sanctiſſimis Patribus preſertim à Chryſostomo in Homiliis aſperſa, quae ſi ad exactae veritatis regulam accommodare volueris, boni ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus manca videbuntur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 28. I obſerve, 5. That tho' our Author would fright us alſo with what the Scripture ſaith of Unity, and againſt Schiſm, (which I confeſs is enough to make us love the one, and hate the other,) yet I do not find this ſtrain uſed againſt all Diviſions, in Scripture without Diſcrimination; but that another Spirit appeareth in theſe Inſpired Writings, and that more of Chriſtian Forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is Recommended, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 11. and 3. Ch.</hi> 1. Diviſions are reproved, and with ſtrong Reaſon condemned: ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18. but that Weight is not laid on them that our Author ſpeaketh of: and <hi>Philip.</hi> 15. 16. Forbearance, and Joyning in Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted Truths and Duties is enjoyned. And I am ſure the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of theſe Times, were Things of more Moment, than our Biſhops Mitres, or Lordly Domination are: The Church might be in Peace, if they either would ſhew us Divine Warrant for their Prelation, or not trouble us with their Uſurpations.</p>
            <p>§. 29. His ſecond Propoſition is, <hi>for the Preſervation of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and preventing of Schiſm, in every particular Church all were bound, in</hi> Cyprian's <hi>time, to live in the Biſhop's Communion, and to owne and look upon him, as the Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to that Church of which he was Head and Ruler.</hi> I ſee not wherein this differeth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150243:22"/>
from the former Propoſition: I am ſure it containeth no new Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and therefore I ſhould have taken no notice of it; but that <hi>p.</hi> 21. he bringeth ſome Citations that need a little to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Altho' I can by no Diligence find ſome of the Places that he citeth, yet by chance I have light on theſe: and the Words he uſeth afford a plain Anſwer to his Argument brought from them. For his firſt Citation out of <hi>Ep.</hi> 33. (I find it in <hi>Ep.</hi> 27.) it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing at all for the Biſhop's ſole Power, nor for his being further <hi>the Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> than what I have above granted. The Caſe was this, ſome of the Lapſed who had been received to the Peace of the Church, (as they pretended) by the means of ſome Martyrs; wrote to <hi>Cyprian</hi> that they were now received by the Church, and deſired that they might be more fully reſtored by <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> and the Church with him: <hi>Cyprian</hi> took it ill that they ſhould write to him as from a Church, whereas they that had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, nor they themſelves, were no Church; but in this had neglected the Authority of them who were truly the Church. In all this <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith nothing but what is according to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Presbyterians: if any ſhould pretend to receive Penitents, even tho' they were Elders in a Congregation, or Miniſters in a Presbytery, without the Moderator, without the Elders, or the Presbytery, <hi>reſpectivè;</hi> we ſhould blame them, for Uſurpation, and diſorderly Walking. And it is very obſervable, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> in this very Paſſage ſaith, that <hi>Eccleſia in Epiſcopo &amp; Clero, &amp; omnibus ſtantibus eſt constituta:</hi> then it is not the Biſhop who is the Church: what he ſaith of the Church as being built on the Biſhop, is already cleared: he ſaith indeed, <hi>omnis actus Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae per eoſdem praepoſitos gubernatur:</hi> in which our Author ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but little Skill, when he tranſlateth theſe words, <hi>all her</hi> (the Churches) <hi>Affairs are ordered by them as the Chief Rulers:</hi> where it ſhould be turned, <hi>by the ſame who are ſet over her</hi> (the Church:) and I think that it will not be denyed that Presbyters are <hi>Praepoſiti,</hi> and are ſet over the Church: he ſaith no more then, but <hi>the Church is founded on the Biſhop,</hi> that is, his ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150243:23"/>
as was before explained, and her Affairs are ruled by the ſame <hi>Praepoſiti;</hi> that is, the Biſhops, and others having Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority with them: For Presbyters are the ſame with Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in this; and that <hi>Cyprian</hi> meaneth ſo, may be gathered from his varying the word <hi>Epiſcopus</hi> into <hi>Praepoſitus.</hi> Again grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that all the Acts of the Church are ruled by the Biſhop, this will not prove that they are ruled by him alone. His other Teſtimony out of what he calleth Epiſtle 43, is far leſs to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; <hi>Feliciſmus,</hi> with his Faction (who formerly had oppoſed <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Election to be Biſhop) in his retirement, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, but without the Concurrence of the Presbytery, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Elderſhip, (I ſhall not determine which of theſe the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> was then governed by) received ſome of the lapſed: which I, as well as my Antagoniſt do reckon a very diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Action; this <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth juſtly blame: And that on this Ground, that they ſet up another Altar in that Church, that is, they threw off the Church Authority that was regularly placed in <hi>Carthage;</hi> and ſet up another beſide: we alſo would blame them who would caſt off the Authority of the Presbytery, or Kirk-Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſet up another. What is <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s meaning is yet clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from what our Author unwarily citeth out of his Book <hi>de unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae Eccleſiae. An eſſe ſibi cum Chriſto videtur qui adverſus Christi Sacerdotes facit? Qui ſe à cleri ejus &amp; Plebis ſocietate ſecernit?</hi> Where he deſcribeth Schiſme to be when ſome depart from the Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Members of the Church (not from the Biſhop alone) and that is to be underſtood, while they keep God's way.</p>
            <p>§. 30. His third Prepoſition is, that <hi>Cyprian maketh the contempt of one Biſhop, or undutifulneſs to him, the original of Schiſme.</hi> I am ſo far from oppoſing him in this, that I think when people begin to quarrel with the meaneſt of Chriſts Miniſters, (unleſs his Life, or Doctrine, or Government, give juſt cauſe) that they ſin againſt God, contemn his Ordinance, and are on the brink of Schiſme; if not Haereſie alſo: And I am ſure all that he citeth out out of <hi>Cyprian</hi> on this head, amounteth to no more except a word
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150243:23"/>
or two, which I ſhall a little conſider. When he ſpeaketh of one <hi>Biſhop,</hi> I underſtand him of one <hi>Praeſes,</hi> whether in a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, or Claſſical <hi>Presbytrey,</hi> and that in conjunction with them: who oppoſeth ſuch Authority oppoſeth Chriſt's Inſtitution. He mentioneth p. 23. as alſo p. 32. <hi>The Biſhops Monarchical power in the Church;</hi> and maketh <hi>Cyprian</hi> prove it by the <hi>Bees</hi> who have a <hi>King,</hi> the Beaſts who have a <hi>Captain,</hi> and <hi>Robbers</hi> who have a <hi>Chiftain.</hi> It is evident to any who conſider <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s other Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that he never arrogated to himſelf a <hi>Monarchical Power</hi> over the Church; for he plainly diſowneth it as we ſhall after have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew: But he is here dealing with one <hi>Pupianus,</hi> who had reproached <hi>Cyprian</hi> as proud and arrogant, here <hi>Cyprian</hi> defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himſelf, and retorteth the ſame Charge of Arrogance on <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pianus</hi> in that he took on him to arraign the Biſhops and Rulers of the Church; and had denyed his power in the Church: and he ſheweth what Inconveniency it were to the Church, if all this time the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> had been governed by a Man who had no Authority: and in this he bringeth the ſimilitude of the <hi>Bees, &amp;c.</hi> Will any think that <hi>Cyprian</hi> was ſo weak as to take this for a ſufficient Argument to prove <hi>Monarchical Power</hi> in the Church: he only bringeth it as a ſimilitude to illuſtrate this Truth, that there muſt be a Government in the Church, and it had been ill with the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> if ſo long a time they had One over them who was no lawful Ruler: which is no Determination of the Extent of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s power; Neither was that the Queſtion between him and <hi>Pupianus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 31. I proceed to his fourth Propoſition, <hi>p. 24. The Biſhop was ſo much the principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity; the people had ſuch Dependence on him, and was ſo virtually in him, that what he did as Biſhop, was reputed the Deed of the whole Church; which he ruled.</hi> And to confirm this, he bringeth Inſtances, that <hi>Churches were blamed for communicating with criminal Biſhops, and that they did not ſeparat from them; and are commended for the Biſhops owning the Truth.</hi> Had our Author thought fit to peruſe and conſider his Papers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150243:24"/>
he printed them, it is like we ſhould not have been troubled with ſuch crude Notions. For 1. How can this be reconciled to what he had a little before-pleaded, concerning the horrid ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſeparating from their Biſhop; and this without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction or Limitation. 2. He is ſo unwiſe as to add one word that ſpoileth all his Deſign, <hi>viz. As Biſhop,</hi> for what a Biſhop acteth <hi>as Biſhop,</hi> he acteth in the Conſiſtory, or the Presbytery; and by the plurality of their Votes: and that is indeed the Fact of the Church <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> and of the Church <hi>diffuſive</hi> too, if they ſhew no diſlike of it; But this is no Semblance of Proof of the Power of Biſhops that he pleadeth for. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Rhetorical flouriſh in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>when</hi> Cornelius <hi>confeſſed the Faith before the Perſecutors, the whole Roman Church confeſſed; Is</hi> no more but that <hi>Cornelius</hi> gave a faithful Teſtimony to that Doctrine, that he had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among that People, and that they received, and did ſtill owne; is this an Argument that <hi>Cornelius</hi> had the ſole Power of Church-Government in <hi>Rome.</hi> Yea, all this might have been ſaid of any Member of that Church who had ſo confeſſed, and the Church did not reclaim, but profeſſed the ſame Truth; It is far leſs probative, that <hi>Cyprian deſired to ſuffer at</hi> Carthage, <hi>rather than elſe where, that he might in Confeſſion be the Mouth of them all.</hi> And leaſt of all is it an Argument, that he calleth them <hi>his Bowels, his Body, their Grief was his Grief, &amp;c.</hi> We muſt abandon all Senſe and Reaſon, if theſe paſs for concludent Arguments. Of the ſame weight is what he bringeth out of <hi>Pontius, of the Bleſſedneſs of the people of</hi> Carthage, <hi>who ſuffered together with ſuch a Biſhop.</hi> I beg the Readers pardon for troubling him with ſuch ſilly Arguments, which need no Anſwer.</p>
            <p>§. 32. His fifth Propoſition, that <hi>the Biſhops being the principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion to his Church, was held before the Cyprianick Age:</hi> This, I ſay needeth no further Animadverſion: for it bringeth no new thing; Neither is it to be imagined that <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whom he citeth, meant that the ſole Authority of the Biſhop, rather than the Doctrine that he taught from the infallible Word of God, was the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150243:24"/>
of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> to the Church: Or, that they who belong to Chriſt are with the Biſhop, whether he teacheth Truth or Error: It is a vaſt miſtake that he ſaith, that <hi>Cyprian, Ep. 33. pleadeth for the divine Right of Epiſcopacy in that Ep.</hi> (which is (<hi>mihi</hi>) 27) he pleadeth for the Divine Authority of the Church, and her Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; that is, Paſtours: not for a Divine Warrant for the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſome of them above others: nothing can be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than the concurrent Teſtimonies of Antiquity againſt this Fancy: Scripture, and the moſt Antient of the Fathers ſpeak of Biſhops and Presbyters indiſtinctly; when the Diſtinction began to be taken notice of, <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith that it was brought in by the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters themſelves: <hi>Ep. ad Evagr.</hi> as alſo on <hi>Tit.</hi> and <hi>Aug. Ep.</hi> 10. referreth to <hi>Eccleſiae uſus.</hi> Yea, <hi>Concil. Nic. 1. Can.</hi> 6. maketh the Diſtinction of Biſhops, as Metropolitans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To be <hi>mos anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quus:</hi> All that followeth, §. 37, 37, 36. doth alſo confute this Opinion. But this I inſiſt not on, becauſe our Author hath put off the proof of that Divine Inſtitution of Epiſcopacy, to his next Eſſay, p. 94. His ſixth and laſt Propoſition is, that <hi>the Principle of the Biſhops being the Center of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity is moſt reaſonable and accountable in it ſelf.</hi> We may now expect ſome <hi>Herculean</hi> Argument, and the higheſt Effort of his Skill: And I am willing that the whole Controverſie be hanged on this Pin. All that he bringeth for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, <hi>every particular Church is an Organical, political Body; and there can be no Organical Body without a Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, on which all the Members muſt hang, and from which being ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they muſt ceaſe to be Members; and who ſo fit for being Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity to a Church as he who is Paſtour, Ruler, Governour, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Head, Judge, Chriſts Vicar, &amp;c.</hi> Not his Concluſion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but an Aſſumption is underſtood, <hi>viz. the Biſhop is all this,</hi> ergo <hi>he is the Center of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> and his <hi>quod erat demonſtrandum</hi> followeth a little after, <hi>it is ſcarce poſſible to prove any thing of this nature more demonſtratively.</hi> One might make ſport with this Argument, which is introduced, and backed with ſuch Parade: But I am in earneſt in this Debate. There are here no leſs than
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150243:25"/>
three Premiſſes expreſſed, and a fourth neceſſarily underſtood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can reach the Concluſion; which every Logician will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn; and when we are at laſt, through all theſe Stages, ariv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Concluſion, it is above diſtinguiſhed, and his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can reach no more than is by us confeſſed: Beſides this, it is hard to ſhew how theſe his Premiſſes hang together, or what Connection they have. Further, that the <hi>principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> in a political Body is one perſon and cannot be a Society, the Conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, or the Presbytery in the Church, will hardly be proved: by this Argument there can be no Unity in a Common-wealth, but only in Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, and Democracy in a Nation are here not only made unlawful, but impoſſible. that the Biſhop is fitteſt to be the Principle of Unity in the Church is <hi>gratis dictum:</hi> Yea, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: Notwithſtanding of the metaphorical Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations that our Author giveth him, from ſome of the Antients. Yea, if a Society cannot be the Center of Unity in a particular Church, who ſhall be the Center of Unity among Biſhops; we muſt ſurely have the <hi>Pope</hi> for this uſe, which is indeed the native concluſion of our Author's Argument that he braggeth ſo much of. But this will afterward occurre.</p>
            <p>§. 33. He cometh now (<hi>p.</hi> 27.) to another Argument: <hi>a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in Cyprian</hi>'s <hi>age, was ſupreme in his Church, immediatly ſubject to Chriſt, had no Eccleſiaſtical Superior on Earth: the Church was one, but divided into many Precincts, each had its Biſhop who was their Supreme.</hi> I am no further concerned in what he ſaith on this head; but what he bringeth for the Biſhops Supremacy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I inſiſt not on his firſt Propoſition, concerning the Equality of Biſhops; I only obſerve that he is for Parity in the Church; and if it be found among Biſhops, I know no Scripture nor Reaſon that condemneth it among Presbyters. To the ſame purpoſe is his ſecond Prepoſition, and his Third, all which are levelled againſt the Supremacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> whoſe cauſe I do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to plead. Wherefore I come to examine his <hi>4th</hi> Propoſition, p. 31. <hi>by the Principles of theſe times, every Biſhop was Chriſts
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150243:25"/>
Vicar, within his own Diſtrict:</hi> So, ſay I, is every Miniſter of the Goſpel; underſtanding by Vicar, one who deriveth his Power from Chriſt, and to him muſt give account of it. He ſaith further, that <hi>a Biſhop had a Primacy in his own Church.</hi> If he mean that he was <hi>primus Presbyter;</hi> I denyed it not, if <hi>that he had the ſole Power in his own perſon,</hi> or that the Presbyters had not a coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate power with him in the Government of the Church, I deny it. Neither is it proved by <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s words, which he citeth; <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dram ſibi conſtituere, &amp; primatum aſſumere:</hi> which I cannot find by what Directions he giveth, and therefore cannot tell what might be further ſaid for vindicating them. The next Expreſſion admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the ſame Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>he managed the Ballance of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> it is not ſaid that he did this by himſelf; Our Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>manageth the Ballance of Government,</hi> but with the Presbytery. The <hi>ſublime Sacerdotii faſtigum,</hi> ſignifieth no more than <hi>primus Presbyter:</hi> The Antients uſe as big words for as low things: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I know any higher Degree in thoſe days: If my Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt will prove it, he muſt uſe other Topicks, than words that may admit various ſignifications. the ſame I ſay of the Expreſſions that follow, the <hi>vigor Epiſcopatus, the ſublimis &amp; divina poteſtas gubernandae Eccleſiae;</hi> This laſt may agree to the meaneſt Member of a Presbytery; Are not Presbyters called by <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſuch as are <hi>divino ſacerdotio honorati:</hi> and <hi>glorioſi ſacerdotes</hi> as himſelf citeth. p. 7. To what purpoſe he citeth <hi>Jerome</hi> for the Parity of Biſhops, and ſaith that <hi>I</hi> will not reject his Teſtimony, I underſtand not. I ſhall neither oppoſe him nor <hi>Jerome</hi> in that Principle.</p>
            <p>§. 34. He bringeth another Argument, (p. 32.) from <hi>the High Prieſt among the</hi> Jews, and ſaith, that <hi>a Biſhop was the ſame to Christians, that he was to the</hi> Jews. I ſee the learned Author is very unhappy in ſtumbling upon popiſh Arguments, and he can ſay litle for his Biſhop, but what they ſay for their <hi>Pope:</hi> And it is evident, that the Papiſts from this <hi>Medium,</hi> argue with much more ſhew of Reaſon: For the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> had univerſal ſupream Authority over the univerſal Church, that then was; The Papiſts
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150243:26"/>
infer the <hi>Pope</hi>'s univerſal Head-ſhip: tho' I am far from thinking this Argument concludent for them; yet what ſhew of Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can it have for a Biſhops Power in his Dioceſs? Or with what Face can this Author ſay, that a Biſhop is the ſame to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Deacons, that he was to the <hi>Levites,</hi> unleſs he ſay that a Biſhop was the ſame to all the Presbyters and Deacons in the World that the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> was to all the <hi>Levites</hi> in the world. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Reaſons, brought from the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> have much more Senſe in them than theſe of our Author: For he pleadeth no more from that Topick, but that as the <hi>High Priest</hi> was to be obyed, and not reſiſted, ſo is the Biſhop. As the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> was reverenced, even by Chriſt, ſo is the Biſhop; we ſay the ſame: that a Biſhop acting in his Sphere, with his Conſiſtory, or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, ſhould be obeyed and reſpected: and we count it the ſame ſort of Sin in Schiſmaticks, who rebel againſt this Church Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, with <hi>Kora</hi>'s Rebellion againſt <hi>Aaron:</hi> but it is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential to infer Church Monarchy from <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Power. I wiſh he had brought any thing that might look like proof of this conſequence. He ſaith, p. 34. that the Chriſtian Hierarchie was copied from that of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and he bringeth Arguments for it, ſuch as they are, one is from the Names, <hi>Prieſt, Prieſthood, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, Sacrafice, &amp;c.</hi> which he calleth a <hi>pregnant Argument;</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſtill obſerve how much the <hi>Papists</hi> owe him; not only for their <hi>Pope,</hi> but for their <hi>unbloody Sacrifice,</hi> what? muſt we have all that of the Old Teſtament whereof we retain the Names? If ſo, we muſt have a new Goſpel. This Argument is eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of its <hi>Pregnancy,</hi> by denying the Conſequence. His other Argument is from an <hi>Ep. of Clement of Rome,</hi> who lived in the Apoſtles times: wherein he exhorteth to Order, and every ones keeping his Station, and then reckoneth up ſeveral Subordinations under the Old Teſtament. <hi>A. Clement</hi> uſeth the Old Teſtament hierarchy as a <hi>ſimile,</hi> to illuſtrate New Teſtament Subordination of Officers in the Church; <hi>ergo</hi> we muſt have the ſame Officers, and they muſt have the ſame Power that theſe had, <hi>non ſequitur:</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:150243:26"/>
Neither was ſuch a Conſequence intended by <hi>Clement:</hi> For a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Anſwer, our Author may know that that, and others of the Epiſtles that go under <hi>Clement's</hi> name are rejected, as none of his, by Learned Men, and on ſolid Grounds.</p>
            <p>§. 35. He hath a long Diſcourſe, beginning <hi>p.</hi> 34. at the end, to ſhew that my Definition of a Biſhop, is conſiſtent with none of the three Principles laſt mentioned, which were current in the <hi>Cyprianick Age;</hi> much leſs with all three together. I have already ſhewed, how far theſe Principles were held in that Age; and how our Notion of a Biſhop agreeth with them all. What ſeemeth to be further Argumentative in this Harangue, I ſhall conſider. He ſaith <hi>the Biſhops being the Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, doth not conſiſt with his being a ſingle Presbyter; where there were four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix Presbyters; as at</hi> Rome: <hi>there would rather be fourty ſix Principles of Diviſions, and make the Church a Monſter with fourty ſix Heads. Anſw.</hi> 1. I retort this Argument: In the <hi>first Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Nice,</hi> (for Example) where were three hundred Biſhops, what was the Principle of Unity? or, were they three hundred Principles of Diviſion? And a Church Meeting, or a Church Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, that was ſo Monſtrous as to have three hundred Heads? What he will anſwer in the one caſe, I will anſwer in the other. And indeed this Argument deſtroyeth the Parity of Biſhops, which he pleadeth for, as well as of Presbyters; and its Native Concluſion is, we muſt either have the <hi>Papacy</hi> over the Church, or <hi>Anarchy</hi> in it. <hi>A.</hi> 2. Where there are many ſuch Presbyters as our Author pleadeth for, we ſay the Biſhop was the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and not a ſingle Presbyter. <hi>A.</hi> 3. In a particular Flock, where are many Ruling, but not Teaching Presbyters, the Biſhop or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, is ſuch a <hi>Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> as I have above owned: and where there are more Biſhops in one Church, the Principle of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is their Teaching the ſame Doctrine: as is above explained. He next alledgeth, that <hi>a Moderator cannot be the Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in a Presbytery; ſeing as ſuch, he is neither Paſtor, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor Chriſtian; but may be a Heathen. A.</hi> This wild Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:150243:27"/>
that a Heathen may be Moderator in a Presbytery, I have fully refuted, §. 8. To the firſt part of his Argument, I ſay, that not the Moderator alone, but with the Presbytery, is the <hi>Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> while they all Teach the ſame Truths, and adhere to the one Rule of our Faith, and Practice, the Word of God: any other Bond, or Cement, by which Men can be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which lyeth in the Authority of a Man, rather than in the true Doctrine, is an Antichriſtian Fancy; and tendeth to enſlave the Conſcience to the Will of Man. We know no ſuch Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Head as he telleth of, but Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 15, 16. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did ever <hi>Cyprian</hi> dream of ſuch a Head of the Church Next he will make our Notion of a Biſhop inconſiſtent with his other Principls, <hi>the Biſhop's Supremacy, and Independency.</hi> I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed, that the Church in <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Time, knew no ſuch <hi>Supremacy, nor Independency:</hi> but held, and Practiſed a Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, not of many to one, but of every one to the Collective Body, and of every leſſer Body to the greater, of which it was a part. I ſee no Reaſon nor Scripture Ground for <hi>Independency,</hi> whether of ſingle Paſtors and Congregations, or of Presbyteries, or of Biſhops; and their Provincial Synods. His third Principle, the Hierarchy under the Goſpel, being the ſame with that under the Old Teſtament, I have refuted, as a groundleſs Fancy; and therefore am under no Obligation to ſhew the Conſiſtency of our Parity with it.</p>
            <p>§. 36. From <hi>p.</hi> 37. he layeth down Principles that would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſtronger, and more pertinent Arguments, than any we have yet met with, if he can but ſufficiently eſtabliſh theſe Principles. He mentioneth three, <hi>viz. 1. The Biſhop's ſole Power in many Acts of Government and Diſcipline. 2. His Negative in all. 3. That all Presbyters were ſubject to his Authority and Juriſdiction.</hi> If all this be true, our Cauſe is loſt: but we are not afraid to try it with him, through his help whoſe Cauſe we plead. Before I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in this Debate with him, I deſire the Reader will reflect on what I obſerved, §. 10. that if we can bring Teſtimonies to prove
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150243:27"/>
a Parity of Power among Presbyters: and that Domination o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them by one, was condemned, or diſowned in <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Time; his bringing Teſtimonies to the contrary, will not be found Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludent: for Contradictory Aſſertions derogate from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Aſſerter: or ſeeming Contradictions muſt be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a fair Expoſition: or, ſuch Teſtimonies will prove, that the Practice and Principles of the Churches of that Age, were not Uniform; any of which would weaken his Cauſe. I ſhall not here repeat the Citations that are full to this purpoſe, which I have on diverſe Occaſions mentioned. Nor need I confine my ſelf to <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Age alone: ſeing our Author pretendeth to no leſs Antiquity for his Way, than from the Apoſtles down ward; yea, all the Ages of the Church; and all the Churches of every Age: and we acknowledge that after the third Century, Church-Government was much altered to the worſe. I ſhall begin with <hi>Ignatius,</hi> both becauſe his Teſtimony is <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem,</hi> at leaſt, ſeing my Antagoniſt, and his Party, lay ſo much Streſs on his Epiſtles: alſo, becauſe if he ſpeak for Parity, it may abate the force of all that they bring out of his Writings to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. What I ſhall alledge from him, I find cited by the famous Arch-Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> in his <hi>Original of Biſhops and Metropolitans, Ignat. Ep. ad Trallianos.</hi>

The Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> in their Epiſtles to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> (which is <hi>Ep.</hi> 31.) do plainly declare their Opinion about the receiving the Lapſed; that it ſhould be done <hi>collatione Conſiliorum cum Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis, Presbyteris, Diaconis, Confeſſoribus, &amp; stantibus Laicis:</hi> this they mean of the general Method that ſhould be laid down for it; it ſhould be Adviſed about by as many as can give Counſel: but when they ſpeak of the Authoritative Sentence; they ſay, it ſhould not be done <hi>ab uno:</hi> then not by a Biſhop acting by ſole Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>Cypr. Ep.</hi> 10. §. 3. Writing to the Clergy of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and ſhewing the evil of overturning Church Diſcipline, as had been done by ſome of their number; he telleth them, <hi>Erunt rei qui praeſunt, &amp; haec fratribus non ſuggerunt, ut inſtructi à praepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitis faciant omnia cum Dei timore.</hi> Where it is evident that they owned them as <hi>praepoſiti;</hi> and charge on them the Duty of giving faithful Warning, according to that their Character: whence it followeth that he did not look on himſelf as being the only <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitus,</hi> or Ruler of that Church. And <hi>Ep.</hi> 28. he commendeth the Clergy of <hi>Carthage,</hi> (while himſelf was abſent from them) that they had debarred from Communicating with them <hi>Gaius Presbyter Diddenſis,</hi> and his Deacon, who had Communicated with the <hi>Lapſed:</hi> and he telleth them that they had Acted like Men of Integrity, and according to the Diſcipline of the Church: <hi>integre &amp; cum Diſciplina feciſtis.</hi> If he had the ſole Power, this Fact of theirs had been quite contrary to Church Diſcipline. If any ſay, that they did this with the Advice of ſome of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s <hi>Collegues,</hi> that is, Biſhops. <hi>A.</hi> Whether theſe were Biſhops or not, we know not: but they only gave Advice, the Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Act was by the Clergy of <hi>Carthage. Ep. 55. §. 17. Cyprian</hi> compareth the number of Presbyters and Deacons who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred

in condemning (<hi>affuerunt judicio &amp; cognitioni</hi>) ſome Schiſmaticks; with the number of them that ſtood for them: which is a clear Argument that the Clergy, with the Biſhop, not onely conſulted, but judicially determined, in Church Affairs. And in the ſame <hi>Epiſt.</hi> §. 21. ſpeaking to <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioneth the Clergy as ruling the Church with <hi>Cornelius:</hi> his Words are, <hi>Florentiſſimo clero illic tecum praeſidenti.</hi> Alſo <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 58. he hath Words of the like importance, §. 2. <hi>Qui cum Epiſcopo Presbyteri ſacerdotali honore conjuncti.</hi> It is alſo evident in many of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Epiſtles, that he divideth the Clergy in <hi>Praepoſitos</hi> (which Word doth manifeſtly ſignifie Rulers) and Deacons. So <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 62, 65. and elſewhere. I only add out of <hi>Cyprian Epiſt. 6. §. 4. Doleo enim quando audio—nec à Diaconis aut Presbyteris regi poſſe. Pamelius's</hi> Note on this Paſſage maketh it yet more plain for us; tho' he was a Papiſt, and no Presbyterian. <hi>Hinc</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>non obſcurè colligitur, viguiſſe adhuc Carthagini, aetate aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, praerogativam Presbyterorum &amp; Diaconorum primitivae Eccleſiae; qua communi totius Presbyterii,</hi> i. e. <hi>Presbyterorum &amp; Diaconorum collegii, conſilio, adminiſtrabantur omnia ab Epiſcopis:</hi> And he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to confirm this, <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as I have before cited him.

            <p>§. 37.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:150243:29"/>
it was written, by <hi>Praepoſitus</hi> is meant Biſhop, and by <hi>Senior</hi> Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, whence it is evident, that here all Church Power is aſcribed to the Presbyter that is given to the <hi>Praepoſitus</hi> or Biſhop. At the ſame time was <hi>Pontius</hi> one of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Deacons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his conſtant Attendant, and who well knew his Principles; he wrote <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Life, and in that Hiſtory he hath theſe Words, <hi>Nulla mora, nulla dilatio Presbyterium &amp; ſacerdotum ſtatum</hi> (that is preſently after his Converſion to Chriſtianity) <hi>accepit: quis enim non omnes honorum gradus crederet tali menti:</hi> where it is plain that <hi>Pontius</hi> thought that all Church Degrees were included in <hi>Sacerdotium &amp; Presbyterium;</hi> which he taketh for one. And a little below he joineth <hi>Sacerdotium &amp; Epiſcopatus</hi> as the ſame Office that <hi>Cyprian</hi> was choſen to, while he was <hi>Neophytus,</hi> and as was thought <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellus.</hi> From all this it appeareth that <hi>Cyprian</hi> was made Prieſt, Presbyter and Biſhop all at once, as being the ſame thing. <hi>Gregor. Nazianz.</hi> (who flouriſhed in the fourth Century) in his <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> telleth us of <hi>the Apostles making Canons for Biſhops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. <hi>and</hi> Tit. 1. <hi>Whether their Office may be called a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, or Rule of Government;</hi> his Words are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He ſaith likewiſe of them, that <hi>they (by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion to be Presbyters) aſcend from being ruled to be Rulers: that they have Authority, not over a Flock; but over mens Souls:</hi> and other very ſublime Powers he aſcribeth to them. And in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he is as profuſe in extolling the Dignity and Authority of Presbyters, as any other in exalting Biſhops. He ſaith, <hi>as many as are ordain'd, are choſen to the high Thrones of Presbytery</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That he ſpeaketh not of Biſhops as diſtinct from Presbyters, is plain, for the deſign of his Diſcourſe, eſpecially in his <hi>Apology,</hi> is to ſhew how the Apoſtle directed Biſhops and Presbyters by the ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, without diſtinguiſhing them, or their work; and that <hi>one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cuſtom had raiſed the Biſhop above them as their</hi> Praeſes.</p>
            <p>§. 38. I next bring <hi>Ambroſe</hi> as a Witnes for us; in his <hi>Epiſtle to Syagrius,</hi> he ſheweth, that <hi>when he and</hi> Syagrius <hi>had ſeverally paſſed Sentence on a Delinquent, the Church was unſatisfied with the Sentence

of</hi> Syagrius, and gave the reaſon, <hi>becauſe he had done it by himſelf, ſine alicujus fratris conſenſu;</hi> but <hi>acquieſced in the Sentence paſſed by Ambroſe,</hi> becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>hoc Judicium noſtrum cum Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribus &amp; Con-Sacerdotibus participatum proceſſit.</hi> Whence it is plain to have been the Principle of thoſe days, that the Biſhop had not ſole Juriſdiction: however ſome were then Graſping at it. <hi>Chryſostom.

                  </gap>) the Church;</hi> and what he had ſaid of Biſhops, he applyeth to the Presbyters. If then <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> was for the Biſhop's ſole Juriſdiction, let any judge. <hi>August. Ep. 19. quanquam ſecundum honorum vocabula quae jam Eccleſiae uſus obtinuit, Epiſcopatus Presbyterio major ſit, tamen in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis rebus Augustinus Hieronymo minor eſt.</hi> Where it may be obſerved, to our purpoſe, 1. That <hi>Auguſtine</hi> placeth the Praelation of a Biſhop above a Presbyter, in the Title of Dignity, but ſpeaketh not a word of Superior Power. 2. He not only inſinuateth, that that Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (ſuch as it was) had its Original, not from Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but Humane Cuſtom; but he ſpeaketh of it as lately ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>jam obtinuit:</hi> this was after 420 years: it was neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, nor univerſal, till then. <hi>Salvianus</hi> maketh the <hi>Levitae &amp; Sacerdotes</hi> to be the Apoſtles Succeſſors; not mentioning Biſhops as diſtinct. So <hi>Gildas</hi> frequently ſpeaketh of Biſhops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters promiſcuouſly. I hope I may alſo adduce <hi>Jerom,</hi> a Presbyter, as a Witneſs, as well as they do other Fathers who were Biſhops. He giveth all manner of Church Power to Presbyters, and not to Biſhops only. <hi>Ep. ad Heliodorum.

            <p>§. 39. Let us now examine what he is pleaſed to bring for the Biſhop's ſole Power in the Church; and againſt the Parity that we have Aſſerted. And firſt, I ſhall examine his three Principles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned. The firſt of which is, <hi>there were ſeveral conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Acts of Power, belonging to the Government and Diſcipline of the Church, which belonged ſolely to the Biſhop; ſeveral Powers Lodged in his Perſon, which he could manage by himſelf, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Concurrence of any other Church-Governour.</hi> Of this ſort he reckoneth eight, <hi>viz. Confirmation, Ordination, Settling Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, Diſpoſal of Church Revenues, Impoſing Charitable Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, Convocating the Presbyters and Deacons, Indicting Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faſts, Delegating two of his Presbyters.</hi> Theſe I ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſtinctly, with his Proofs for what he Aſſerteth about them. For the firſt of theſe, <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the <hi>Adult,</hi> who had in their Infancy been Baptized; at firſt it was no more, but after diligent Inſtructing them in the Grounds of Religion, bringing them to the Paſtor of the Church, (and probably before the Elderſhip) that they might be tryed in their Proficiency, and ſo declared fit to receive the Lord's Supper: in which nothing can be blamed. Afterward it came to be more Theatrically managed, and <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Hands</hi> was the Ceremony by which it was ſet off: till at laſt it came to be eſteemed a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Now when it was thus turned from the Simplicity of God's Ordinance, to be a Pompous Device of Man, (not a few of which were crept into the Church in, yea before <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Age) it is not ſtrange, if they committed not the managing of it to all, to whom Chriſt had committed his Ordinances; but to one of their own chuſing. Our Debate
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:150243:30"/>
is, whether the Biſhop had ſole Power of managing any of Chriſt's Ordinances; of which number this is not. Yet I find litle ſtrength in our Author's Arguments for this Power in the Biſhop. His firſt Proof is, <hi>Cypr. Ep. ad Jubajanum, it was the Cuſtom to offer ſuch as were Baptized to the Biſhops, that by their Prayers, and the Laying on of their Hands, they might receive the Holy Ghoſt, and be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated by the Sign of our Lord:</hi> which our Author taketh to be <hi>the Sign of the Croſs.</hi> Here <hi>Cyprian</hi> uſeth the word <hi>Praepoſitis,</hi> which our Author is pleaſed to tranſlate Biſhops; whereas Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alſo were called by that Name. For <hi>Cyprian, Ep.</hi> 3. §. 1. the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, (when they had no Biſhop,) ſaid of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that <hi>it appeared that they were Praepoſiti;</hi> and thence infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that <hi>it was incumbent on them to take Care of the Flock:</hi> and they ſpeak of idle Shepherds as <hi>neglegentes Praepoſiti,</hi> whoſe Reproof was to be a Warning to them. And <hi>Cypr. Ep. and Jubajan.</hi> which is 69. §. 4. plainly calleth the Succeſſors of the ſeventy Diſciples, as well as theſe of the Apoſtles, <hi>Praepoſitos:</hi> for of them that place <hi>Luc.</hi> 10. 16. which he citeth, is to be underſtood. And <hi>Ep.</hi> 62. §. 1. he ſheweth how Church Diſcipline is to be regarded, <hi>à Praepoſitis &amp; Plebe.</hi> And <hi>Ep.</hi> 65. §. 4. he mentioneth <hi>Epiſcopos &amp; Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitos,</hi> as diſtinct. And <hi>Ep.</hi> 21. which is <hi>Celerini ad Lucium, §. 3. quorum jam cauſa audita, praeceperunt eos Praepoſiti ſic eſſe donec Epiſcopus conſtituatur.</hi> And <hi>de Lapſis, §. 4. Praepoſitos ſuperbo tumore contemnere:</hi> it is ſpoken of all the Rulers of the Church. For a further Refutation of this his Principle, it may be obſerved, that this <hi>Confirmation,</hi> of which <hi>Cyprian</hi> here ſpeaketh, is not that which in our days goeth under that Name; but that uſed in the Apoſtolick Church, the Effect of which, was the giving of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost;</hi> as is clear from his citing <hi>Act. 8. 14, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of what they did, and their Warrant for it. Now that <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands</hi> was not given to all the Baptized; but only to ſuch as were <hi>ad miniſterium ordinandi,</hi> ſaith <hi>Lightfoot:</hi> it was not <hi>ad ſanctificationem, ſed ad dona extraordinaria;</hi> ſaith the ſame Author. <hi>Piſcator, Beza, Grotius,</hi> do alſo ſo expound this place:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:150243:31"/>
wherefore it proveth nothing, except our Author can tell us what <hi>Cyprian</hi> meant by it: which I can not; ſeing the extraordinary Gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> were then ceaſed, for any thing that we know. His next Citation, out of <hi>Firmilian,</hi> deſtroyeth what it is brought for; for he aſcribeth to Biſhops the Power of <hi>Baptiſm, Confirmation, Ordination:</hi> his Word is, they <hi>poſſeſs</hi> this Power: I hope he will not ſay that Presbyters had no Power in Baptiſm: wherefore by Biſhops here <hi>Firmilian</hi> muſt mean the Paſtors of the Church; all of whom were frequently called Biſhops at that time: yea, himſelf confeſſeth, that theſe ſpoken of, were the <hi>majores natu,</hi> whom he moſt abſurdly pleadeth to be Biſhops, as diſtinct from preaching Presbyters. Of as little weight is what <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſaith of <hi>Novatianus (Euſebius</hi> maketh <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſay this of <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> chap. 42.) that he was not confirmed by the Biſhop; for in that place <hi>Cornelius</hi> queſtioned not only the Confirmation of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus,</hi> but his Baptiſm: and that he ſpeaketh not of the ordinary Confirmation, but of that which belonged to Prieſts, is clear; for he ſaith, <hi>how then came he by the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> and he is there plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his incapacity to be a Biſhop, on that account. But of this too much: for it doth not hurt our Cauſe if it be granted that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops then were ſo far diſtinguiſhed from other Presbyters, that they uſurped a Power which our Lord had not given to them, nor any man elſe, at that time; what ever he had before done to them whom he immediatly ſent, and extraordinarly endowed.</p>
            <p>§. 40. The ſecond Act of Power that he aſcribeth to the <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anick</hi> Biſhop alone is, <hi>He had the ſole Power of Ordination; and that of whatſoever Clergy-men within his District. Ordinations could not be performed without him: but he could perform them regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly without the concurrence of any other Church-Officer:</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>this hath ſo frequently and fully been proved by learned men, that he need inſist little on it.</hi> All which we deny: neither do I find any Argument here brought by him, nor have <hi>I</hi> found in the Writings of his learned men (and I may, without vanity, ſay, I have ſeen the ſtrongeſt of them) which might be a rational
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:150243:31"/>
ground of Conviction. Before I examine his Proofs for this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall prove the <hi>Antitheſis:</hi> That Presbyters did, in that age, and before, joyn in the Ordination of Presbyters. And firſt, it is evident from <hi>Jerom</hi>'s words, ſo much inſiſted upon by our Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Brethren, <hi>Alexandriae, a Marco evangeliſta uſ<expan>
                     <am>

Chriſti</hi> 246, all the Power or Authority that the Biſhop had, was given him by the Presbyters; they elected him, nor had he any other Ordination, or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Power, but what he had from them; in the Opinion of <hi>Jerome.</hi> If then the Presbyters made a Biſhop; it could not be he alone, but the Biſhop with them, and as one of them who made Presbyters. 2. <hi>Hilarius,</hi> who lived in the midle of the fourth Century, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. hath theſe words, <hi>apud Aegyptum Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteri conſignaverunt, ſi praeſens non fuit Epiſcopus.</hi> Whether ye interpret <hi>Conſignaverunt</hi> of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> as ſome, or <hi>Conſecration</hi> of Church-Officers, as others, it cometh to the ſame Concluſion: ſeing our Author and his Complices, reſerve both theſe Powers to the Biſhop; and it is probable they were not divided. That they did it <hi>abſente Epiſcopo,</hi> doth imply that they had that Authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for without it they could not have done it at all. 3. <hi>Novatus</hi> a Presbyter in <hi>Carthage,</hi> while <hi>Cyprian</hi> was Biſhop: Ordained <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciſſimus:</hi> This Ordination (tho' no doubt it was irregular, being done without the Moderator and the Presbytery) yet it was not lookt on as null, but <hi>Novatus</hi> was, after that, owned by <hi>Cyprian:</hi> and <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> continued to be a Deacon. To this our Author anſwereth p. 42. that <hi>not Novatus, but neighbouring Biſhops by the procurement of Novatus, did it.</hi> But <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s words are plain; <hi>Feliciſſimum diaconum ſua factione conſtituit.</hi> That this Deacon was ordained by Biſhops is <hi>gratis dictum.</hi> I have alſo elſewhere proved, that in <hi>Scotland</hi> there were Presbyters ruling the Church, long before they had Biſhops: which could not be if none but Biſhops could Ordain them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:150243:32"/>§. 41. <hi>Cyprian Ep.

This doth ſufficiently ſhew that Ordinations were not performed without the Determination of the Presbytery. But it is alſo manifeſt, that in the ſolemnizing of them, by impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hands, the Presbyters had their Share with the Biſhop. <hi>Cypr- Ep.</hi> 10. §. 2.

(as he quoteth it) <hi>a primordio Epiſcopatus mei ſtatueram nihil ſine conſilio vestro &amp; ſine conſenſu plebis, mea privatim ſententia gerere.</hi> I ſay, if this be not meant of <hi>Ordination,</hi> it is here very impertinently brought in. Nor can his Comment on <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s words help him, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>this was his voluntary Condeſcendence, that he was not bound to:</hi> To prove which he putteth <hi>Statueram</hi> in <hi>majuſculis</hi> as if it were not uſual with good men when they enter on an Office, to reſolve to keep within the bounds of their power; to manage it lawfully; as well as to cede in what is their Right. But that <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear that ſenſe, I prove by the Reaſon he giveth; <hi>ſic mutuus honor expoſcit:</hi> the <hi>mutuus honor</hi> muſt be that due regard that he had to their Authority in the Church, and they ought to have to his: it had been a diſhonouring of them, and ſetting them lower than Chriſt had ſet them in his Church, for him to mannage her Affairs without them. And <hi>Ep.</hi> 18. he maketh this Matter yet clearer; <hi>Quae res, cum omnium nostrum conſilium &amp; ſententiam ſpectet, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicare ego, &amp; ſoli mihi rem communem vindicare non audeo.</hi> Where it is manifeſt, that it was conſcience of Duty, and not good Nature onely, that induced him to this Conduct. Alſo that he attributeth to Presbyters not <hi>conſilium</hi> onely, but <hi>ſententiam;</hi> not onely a <hi>conſultative Power,</hi> but alſo <hi>definitive,</hi> or <hi>deciſive.</hi> The Apoſtle who had indeed a <hi>ſole Juriſdiction,</hi> ſpake in another Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. I have judged already. Cyprian</hi> durſt not do ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew he had not that <hi>ſole Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 42. Let us now hear his Proofs for the Biſhop's <hi>ſole Power of Ordination.</hi> The firſt is, What is ſaid of the <hi>Ordination</hi> of <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> which I have already ſhewed to be againſt him. Wherefore I ſhall onely take notice of his Obſerves on this Paſſage, by which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:150243:33"/>
he would force it to ſpeak for him. 1. That <hi>his Power was the ſame in all Ordinations. I</hi> ſhall not much contend about this: only, if they put the Power of <hi>Ordaining</hi> Officers of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing into the hands of whom they would; it doth not thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that they might, or did ſo diſpoſe of <hi>Ordaining Power</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to theſe whom God had appointed, and about whoſe <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> he had given Rules in the Word. 2. <hi>He uſed only to ask their Counſel about the manners and Merits of the perſon to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; not their concurrence in the Act of Ordination.</hi> This is a Miſtake, he asked not their Counſel only, but their joynt Suffrage, as is above ſhewed. That their Concurrence in the Act of <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> is not here mentioned, is not to his purpoſe; ſeing it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential to their Office, and Church Power. That <hi>it is fairly imported in the inſtance of</hi> Aurelius <hi>that they uſed not to concur,</hi> is a groundleſs Imagination; For this is a ſingle Inſtance in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary caſe, and he ſpendeth a whole Epiſtle in making Apologie for it: Yea, he more than inſinuateth the contrary, when he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth what he uſed to do, and giveth a ſingular Reaſon for what he now did. I wonder that common Senſe doth not teach him that ſuch an Act doth not import a Cuſtom. 3. That <hi>it was intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his own eaſineſs and condeſcendency that he conſulted them in the matter:</hi> This I have above refuted; and it is inconſiſtent with what himſelf elſewhere ſaith, that the Biſhop <hi>was the Monarch,</hi> and <hi>the Presbyters his Senate:</hi> I hope he will not ſay that it is <hi>ex bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placito</hi> that Kings conſult their Parliaments: Unleſs he be for the Turkiſh Government both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>§. 43. Another Teſtimony (which he calleth <hi>Remarkable</hi> p. 40.) is <hi>Cyprian Ep. 41. had given a Deputation to</hi> Caldonius <hi>and ſome others, to examine the Ages, Qualifications, and Merits of ſome in</hi> Carthage, <hi>that he, whoſe Province it was to promote Men to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Offices, might be well informed about them, and promote none but ſuch as were meek, and humble, and worthy.</hi> His Remark is, <hi>he ſpeaks of himſelf in the ſingular Number, as having the power of promoting; and he founds that Power, and appropriats it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150243:33"/>
upon his having the care of the Church, and the Government of Her committed to him,</hi> For <hi>A.</hi> I obſerve a few things on this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. 1. This Delegation of <hi>Caldonius</hi> and the reſt, was not to <hi>Carthage,</hi> as our Author dreameth; which appeareth by the end of the Epiſtle, in which he bids <hi>Caldonius,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>read this Ep. to the Brethren, and tranſmit it to</hi> Carthage <hi>to the Clergy:</hi> which had been incongruous if their Errand and Work had been at <hi>Carthage.</hi> Next, this is in conſiſtent with what <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and our Author ſaith was his Practice; <hi>viz. to conſult the presbyters about who were fit to be ordained:</hi> It is ſtrange that he ſhould ſend Strangers to <hi>Carthage</hi> for ſuch Enquiry, and to inform him, with the neglect of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. 2. It is alſo clear from the Epiſtle, §. 1. That this Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was about ſome Sufferers who belonged to the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> (may be, baniſhed, or impriſoned, or confined ſome where) where they were in neceſſity; for he ſaith he ſent them, <hi>ut expungeretis neceſſitates fratrum nostrorum ſumptibus, &amp;c.</hi> That <hi>they might pay their Debts</hi> (as <hi>Pamelius</hi> expoundeth it) and <hi>that they might furniſh them for following their Trades, if they ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined:</hi> And the enquiry about their fitneſs for Church-Work ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be intended on the by; for he bringeth it in with <hi>ſimul etiam.</hi> 3. That <hi>he ſpeaketh of himſelf in the ſingular Number,</hi> doth no way infer that he alone was to promote any who were quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied among theſe Sufferers: Neither his having the care of Church Government committed to him: For <hi>ego cui cura incumbit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moverem,</hi> ſaith nothing at all of ſole care, nor of ſole Power. Not only a Moderator, but any Member of a Presbytery, to whom the Ordination of Miniſters belongeth, might ſay as much; might deſire to know worthy perſons, and give the Reaſon, that <hi>it is not Curioſity, but it belongeth to my Office to Ordain ſuch as are fit, and therefore I deſire to know their qualities.</hi> His next Citation hath no more ſtrength: For it ſaith no more than that ſome in a State of Schiſme have been ordained by falſe Biſhops; whence he inferreth, that <hi>all Ordinations in the true, and in the falſe Church were perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:150243:34"/>
by Biſhops.</hi> This is not the Queſtion; but whether they were ordained by Biſhops acting each of them alone.</p>
            <p>§. 44. He next bringeth <hi>Ep.</hi> 39. where <hi>Cyprian</hi> writeth to his Clergy, that he had Ordained <hi>Celerinus;</hi> and <hi>Ep. 29. Satu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and <hi>Optatus;</hi> and that <hi>tho' ſome of them were but young, and he Ordained them to Inferior Offices; yet he deſigned they ſhould ſit with him in their Riper Years: that is,</hi> (ſaith our Author) <hi>he deſigned them for the Presbyterate.</hi> And he very Learnedly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that <hi>Cyprian telleth his Presbyters this in a very Authoritative Stile, even in a Stile by which Superiors uſed to ſignifie their Will and Pleaſure to their Subjects;</hi> with a <hi>be it known unto you.</hi> Here a little Reflection will ſerve. 1. Here is ſtill the old Fallacy; <hi>Cyprian</hi> Ordain'd theſe Perſons, <hi>ergo,</hi> he did it alone. 2. It is ſo far from that, that of <hi>Celerinus</hi> he ſaith expreſly, it was done <hi>by him and his Collegues, Ep.</hi> 34. §. 1. As in the former, <hi>Ep.</hi> 33. he had ſaid of <hi>Aurelius.</hi> 3. The preſent Diſſipation of the Church, made ſome things neceſſary, which were neither uſual, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable out of that Caſe: as that <hi>Cyprian,</hi> with ſuch as he could then get to concur with him, Ordained ſome Perſons without the Concurrence of the Presbytery; who then, it ſeems, through the Perſecution that was at <hi>Carthage,</hi> could not get that Work ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged. 4. For <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Stile in his Epiſtle to the Presbytery, I think many moe will ſmile at his Fancy, than will be convinced by the ſtrength of his Reaſon drawn from it: <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s word is, <hi>Sciatis,</hi> which our Author putteth <hi>in majuſculis,</hi> to give his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſome more pith: but who knoweth not that this Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſignifieth barely a notifying of a thing to another; and is commonly uſed (eſpecially in the Latine Tongue) to Superiors, Inferiors, or Equals. It is a token of a mind deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with <hi>the Majeſty of a Biſhop,</hi> (as he elſewhere expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf,) when this word doth ſo ſound in his ears. The Ordination of <hi>Novatianus,</hi> which he next bringeth as an Argument for him, rather is againſt him: it was an Act condemned by the Clergy and People, by <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s conſtant Practice; and that which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:150243:34"/>
he lookt on as Duty, (as hath been ſhewed before,) and was the Practice of an Aſpiring <hi>Pope:</hi> yea which himſelf promiſed ſhould not be made a Praecedent. Can any body think this is a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove the Cuſtom of that Age? Neither can it be made appear, that this Ordination was performed by the Biſhop alone: eſpecially ſeing our Author ſaith, <hi>the Biſhop prevailed and Ordained him.</hi> It is like he prevailed with ſome, at leaſt, of the Clergy, tho' they did at firſt much reſiſt it. He ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 42. that <hi>any concurrence of Presbyters with the Biſhop in Ordination, is not to be found in</hi> Cyprian'<hi>s Works, nor in his Age.</hi> I hope the Reader is by this time convinced of the contrary. He next, <hi>p.</hi> 43. brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth for Proof, the <hi>ſecond Canon of the Apostles,</hi> commonly ſo called, which is, <hi>let a Presbyter be Ordained by one Biſhop, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Deacon, and the reſt of the Clergy.</hi> But our Author might know, that the Authority of theſe <hi>Canons,</hi> is controverted even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Papiſts: as <hi>Sixtus Senenſis, Lib. 2. ad vocem Clemens, p. (mihi</hi>) 62, 63. And <hi>Caranza. Summa. Concilior:</hi> and others ſhew. The Contentions that are about the number of them, make them to be all ſuſpected. <hi>Rivet. Critic. Sacr. Lib. 1. C. 1. p.</hi> 93. and P. <hi>Martyr. Loc. Com. Claſſ. 4. C. 4. p. (mihi)</hi> 779. bring ſufficient Grounds for rejecting them, as neither done by the Apoſtles, nor collected by <hi>Clement,</hi> as is alledged. Again if this <hi>Canon</hi> were admitted, it proveth not the Concluſion: for one Biſhop Ordaineth, when the Moderator with the Presbytery doth it: and that <hi>Canon</hi> is obſerved, when no more are called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the Ordination of a Presbyter. His Compariſon of the Biſhop's Power in this, with the <hi>Rights of Majesty in giving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,</hi> is vain Talk: unleſs he can prove a Monarchy, and that abſolute in the Church, which can never be done: for the <hi>Canon</hi> mentioned, being univerſally received in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, it is not without Doubt, as he alledgeth, for all <hi>Beveregius</hi>'s Arguments which he boaſteth of; but produceth none of them. One thing I cannot paſs, <hi>p.</hi> 44. he telleth, that <hi>after Cyprian</hi>'s <hi>time, it was appointed by the Canons, that Presbyters ſhould concur with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150243:35"/>
in Ordinations:</hi> which overthroweth all his Diſcourſe of the Biſhop's <hi>Majeſty, Soveraignty, Incontrollable and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>naccountable Power,</hi> &amp;c. And it is evident to any who is Converſant in the Hiſtory of the Church, that Epiſcopal Power did rather continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally increaſe, than ſuffer Diminution, till it arrived at the height of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> (which in the beſt ſenſe, is his <hi>Sublime Fastigium Sacerdotii.</hi>) And then indeed the <hi>Pope</hi> began to clip the Wings of other Biſhops, that he might crow over them.</p>
            <p>§. 45. His third Prerogative of the Biſhop in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, <hi>is his full Power, without asking the conſent or concurrence of either Clergy or People, to ſetle Presbyters within his Diſtrict.</hi> And on this occaſion he ridiculeth our Principle of <hi>the peoples Power of chooſing their own Miniſters.</hi> All the Prooff of this confident Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inſolent Contempt of them who are otherwiſe minded, is, <hi>Cyprian Ep.</hi> 40. wrote to <hi>Carthage, that they ſhould receive</hi> Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus <hi>as a Presbyter among them:</hi> and our Author addeth, <hi>probably he was ordained before.</hi> 1. If our Author had pleaſed to ſtate and argue the Queſtion about the <hi>Power of Election,</hi> I ſhould have been willing to joyn Iſſue with him. Or if he had thought fit to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer what I have elſewhere written on that Head, in a Book that he hath ſeen, and cited, when he thought he could ſay ſomething againſt it, I ſhould have conſidered the ſtrength of what he would ſay: but he doth wiſely ſhun that Controverſie: neither ſhall I dip in it, further than is neceſſary for anſwering his Book. 2. If <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midicus was ordained before,</hi> then was he alſo placed in <hi>Carthage</hi> before; and we have cauſe to think that he was ordained by the conſent and concurrence of the Presbyters of <hi>Carthage:</hi> at leaſt our Author cannot prove the contrary, which is neceſſary for eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Concluſion. 3. He who animadverteth on <hi>Pamelius</hi>'s Notes on <hi>Cyprian,</hi> hath theſe Words, on the beginning of the Epiſtle, <hi>Etſi vocatio</hi> Numidici <hi>magis erat extraordinaria quam ordinaria, tamen non ſine plebe</hi> Carthaginenſe <hi>Presbyterio aſcribitur:</hi> whence he infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that Ordinations without their conſent, are <hi>profanae &amp; irritae.</hi> 4. His work is to prove that it was the Practice and Principle of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150243:35"/>
the <hi>Cyprianick-Age,</hi> that a Biſhop by himſelf placed Miniſters: this cannot be inferred from one ſingle inſtance; and that in a time of Perſecution and Diſſipation; and where there was ſo ſignal appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Divine determination, that <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s words are, <hi>admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos nos, &amp; inſtructor dignatione divina, ſciatis, ut Numidicus Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter adſcribatur Presbyterorum Carthaginienſium numero.</hi> Any who deſireth to be fully ſatisfied in this Point of Election of Paſtors, let him read <hi>Blondel. Apolog. Pro ſententia Hieron.</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 379. to the end, even to <hi>p.</hi> 548. where it is traced through all the Ages of the Church.</p>
            <p>§. 46. The Biſhop's fourth Priviledge is, <hi>he had the Diſpoſal of all the Revenues of the Church.</hi> This our Author maintaineth <hi>p. 44, &amp;c. he had the full Power of this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ibid.</hi> I here obſerve, that if we ſhould yield all that he aſſerteth, it maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the <hi>ſole Power</hi> of the Biſhop in <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> or <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church:</hi> for theſe diſtributions were always reckoned a Service, not any Act of Government in the Church: the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Church Power are not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Further, I obſerve, that the Authoritative Direction in managing theſe Matters, did belong to all Church Rulers: The Apoſtles had the Power; but they were not at leiſure to attend the managing of theſe things, as our Author's Biſhop is; but committed it to Deacons, who were Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers appointed for that very end, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. I obſerve thirdly, that however to be thus imployed, might ſute well with the way and temper of the the Biſhops of our time; who generally are more imployed about Secular Affairs, than in Preaching: it was not conſiſtent with the Labour of the Primitive Biſhops about the Gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Souls. Fourthly, it is evident, that in the Ages after the Apoſtles, the Deacons had the Charge of the <hi>bona Eccleſiaſtica; ergo,</hi> not the Biſhop only. <hi>Origen in Matth. 16. Menſis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiasticarum pecuniarum Diaconi praeſunt.</hi> Item, <hi>Diaconi qui non bene traetant pecuniarum Eccleſiasticarum menſas, &amp; ſemper de eis fraudant, &amp; ipſas quas diſpenſant non ſecundum justitiam diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant &amp; divites fiunt de rebus pauperum, ipſi ſunt numularii pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150243:36"/>
menſas habentes quas evertet Dominus.</hi> It is fifthly to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, how abſurd it is, and what a ſnare, for any one man to have the ſole Diſpoſal of all the Goods of the Church, who may take what he will of them, for his <hi>propria portio,</hi> (to uſe our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's words) and give what he will to the other Church-Officers, and to the Poor. This is a Truſt might make bad Biſhops (and ſuch there were even in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time) a Scandal, and might expoſe the beſt to Obloquie: and lay a Foundation for perpetual Grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings and Diſcontents in the Church: to prevent which, the Lord by his Apoſtles, appointed Deacons to ſuperintend that Affair, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. Let us now hear what our Author pleadeth for his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: he telleth us that <hi>the Biſhop not only had his propria portio,</hi> which he will have to be <hi>the third of all;</hi> and he obſerveth, that <hi>this made Fortunatianus and Baſilides ſo earneſt for Reſtitution to their Sees, after Depoſition,</hi> (and in our days maketh many Sell, or Ruine the Church for theſe Lucrative Promotions) but he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Biſhop had alſo the Diſpoſal of the reſt. For which his Proof, firſt as to the Clergies part; <hi>Feliciſſimus is blamed for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending about his ſhare, contrary to his Duty to his Biſhop: and others are praiſed who took their ſhares as the Biſhop ſhould pleaſe to diſpenſe them. A.</hi> 1. That the Biſhop here is meant in his ſole, or ſingle Capacity; and not rather in Conjunction with the Presbytery wherein he praeſided, is denyed, and can never be proved. Yea, the contrary is evident, <hi>Ep.</hi> 41. (which he citeth) where ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them who were ſo tractable, he uſeth theſe words, <hi>&amp; vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis acquieſcere maluiſſe;</hi> that is, ſubmitted to their (the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries) Determination about their ſhares. 2. If a School Boy ſhould make ſuch a Verſion of Latine into Engliſh, as our Author here doth, he would be laſht for it. He turneth, <hi>Epiſcopo Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſante, as the Biſhop ſhould pleaſe to Diſpenſe them:</hi> whereas the Biſhop's Diſpenſing, was nothing but his giving out Sentence as the Presbytery had Determined; not as he, by himſelf, pleaſed. Likewiſe, he taketh no notice of theſe words, <hi>&amp; vobis acquieſcere maluiſſe:</hi> which is a great Error in Tranſlation. 3. It is evident
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:150243:36"/>
from <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s own words, that he did not act ſolely in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but with the Authoritative Concurrence of the Presbytery; for a little before the words cited, he ſaith, <hi>cumque poſt haec om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, nec loci mei honore motus, nec veſtra authoritate &amp; praeſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia fractus,</hi> &amp;c. where he blameth <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> for deſpiſing the Biſhops honour, and the Presbyters Authority: clearly inſinuating the Difference of the Biſhop and Presbyters of his time, that he had more Honour than they; but not more Authority. The ſame way are we to underſtand <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s promoting <hi>Aurelius</hi> and <hi>Celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> only to the Degree of Lectors; but entitleing them to the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Presbyters: <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Cyprian</hi> might propoſe this to the Presbytery, tho' he could not effect it without them: his words are, <hi>Presbyterii honorem deſignaſſe me illis, &amp; ut ſportulis iiſdem</hi>—he deſigned it, becauſe they were choice Young-men, but it was the Presbytery concurring with him, that muſt make this effectual. He ſaith for the Poors part, <hi>the Biſhop's Power in Diſtributing it, is ſo evident from Ep. 5. and 41. that I need not inſist on it. A.</hi> In <hi>Ep.</hi> 41. (which is that we were juſt now Debating about) there is not one word to that purpoſe; but that he had ſent ſome to relieve the Neceſſities of ſome Sufferers: but out of what Fond, whether his <hi>propria portio,</hi> or any other, is not ſaid. And if it were out of the Churches Stock, it is not ſaid he did this without the Presbytery: he might very well ſay he did it, when the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery appointed it, and he put it in Execution. What he ſaith in the 5. <hi>Ep.</hi> is as fully againſt our Author's Deſign, as any thing can be. He bids them, both in Diſcipline and Diligence, <hi>act both their own parts and his.</hi> And he hath theſe words <hi>quantum autem ad ſumptus ſuggerendos, ſive illis qui glorioſa voce Deum confeſſi, in carcere ſunt constituti, ſive iis qui pauperes &amp; indigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes laborant, &amp; tamen in Domino perſeverant, peto ut nihil deſit: cum ſumma omnis quae redacta eſt, illic ſit apud Clericos diſtributa propter ejusmodi caſus, &amp;c.</hi> Is it not here evident, that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy are intruſted with the Poors Money, and are to diſtribute it as need requireth: and that this Diſtribution in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Abſence,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150243:37"/>
was a doing of their own Work and his; ſo that they Acted not as his Delegats. Further, they <hi>Acted their own part and his,</hi> when one of them did praeſide in their Meetings in his Abſence: which was, in theſe days, his peculiar Work; neither do we find that he Deputed one to praeſide; but left it to the Presbytery, to chooſe whom they thought fit. He next bringeth the 38. <hi>and 41. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Apoſtles,</hi> to prove what he deſigned. I have above ſhewed what Weight is to be laid on their Authority. Nor do they give this Power to the Biſhop alone; but the Biſhop is to be lookt on, with reſpect to what is there ſaid, as praeſiding in the Presbytery. What he citeth out of <hi>Juſtine Martyr,</hi> ſaith no more, but the Biſhop hath <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Care of the Eccleſiaſtical Goods: which we willingly yield to him, and to every one of the Presbytery: but it is not ſaid, he alone hath this Care. He would have us believe, that this ſole Power of the Biſhop, is fairly foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on Scripture: but citeth no place. I know no more where to find theſe places of Scripture, than I know where to find ſome places of <hi>Cyprian</hi> that he citeth. I am ſure <hi>Act.</hi> 6. maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him; but on the contrary. Neither 2 <hi>Corinth 8. and 9. Chapters.</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> was a Delegate in carrying that Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution to <hi>Judea:</hi> and if he had claimed more Power; it will be hard to prove the Biſhop's Power to extend as far as that of an Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>§. 47. The Biſhop's fifth Power that he alone poſſeſſed is, <hi>of impoſing charitable Contributions on all the Chriſtians within his District, for the Relief of Strangers, &amp;c.</hi> For which he refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to <hi>Ep. 62. and</hi> 78. but citeth no words. I can find nothing to that purpoſe in either of them, as in my Book. For his alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>Soter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for this Practice, cited by <hi>Euſebius, Lib. 4. Cap.</hi> 23. (<hi>mihi</hi> 22.) there is no more in it, but that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> commendeth that Church for their wonted charitable Diſtributions to other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and that <hi>Soter</hi> had obſerved, and improved this Cuſtom: this may be fairly expounded of exhorting to Charity without
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:150243:37"/>
Authoritative Impoſing of Contributions; which any Miniſter may do. And if he did impoſe, it is not ſaid he did it by himſelf, tho' he is only mentioned; as, perhaps, being ſingularly active in ſtirring up both the Presbytery and the People: and he was to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in the Church, the Presbyteries Determination in this. What is there in all this for a <hi>ſole Power</hi> in this Matter? His next full Power is, <hi>Indicting of Fasts:</hi> for which he citeth <hi>Tertullian de Jejun.</hi> But it is obſervable that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh of Biſhops in the plural number; now it is not to be thought that no Faſts were Indicted but by a Meeting of Dioceſans: wherefore <hi>Epiſcopi</hi> muſt be the Presbytery. Or if he mean the ſeveral Biſhops in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Churches: it may be rationally underſtood of the Biſhop's intimating to the People, what is by common Conſent Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; not what he enjoyneth by his <hi>ſole Authority.</hi> The ſeventh Branch of the Biſhop's Prerogative is, <hi>to Convocate the Presbytery and Deacons.</hi> And let him enjoy it, for it is what we grant to our Moderator: and there is a natural neceſſity, that it be in the Power of ſome perſon to call them together, when any emergent doth require it. And ſeing in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, the Biſhop was the <hi>conſtant Moderator,</hi> it was conſequential that he ſhould be the <hi>constant Conveener.</hi> But what <hi>Prerogative,</hi> or <hi>ſole Power</hi> this doth infer, or what Eccleſiaſtick Authority above the Brethren it importeth, I cannot underſtand. Let any who hath clear uſe of reaſon judge, how this proveth the Biſhop's managing the Affairs of the Church <hi>like a chief Governour,</hi> as our Author drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, <hi>p.</hi> 48. Neither doth it appear, that the Biſhop might convocate the Presbyters at pleaſure, (as he fancieth) but when there was cauſe: as in the Inſtance he bringeth there was. He bringeth in, on this Occaſion, an Obſervation, that <hi>Cornelius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived theſe perſons about whom he called the Presbytery, without as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Peoples conſent; but acquainted them after it was done.</hi> But our Author hath forgot what he had a few Lines before ſaid, that <hi>after they were received in the Presbytery, the People were made acquainted with it;</hi> not one word of the Biſhop's receiving them
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150243:38"/>
by himſelf. This is nothing contrary to Presbyterian Principles and Practices. Yea (as if he had deſign'd to refute himſelf) he citeth a Letter of theſe Perſons, ſhewing that they were <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the Biſhop, and to the whole Clergy:</hi> where is then the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's <hi>ſole Power</hi> of receiving Penitents? He propoundeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an Objection; that <hi>the Presbyters at</hi> Rome <hi>met in a Vacancy, after the Biſhop's Death: and at</hi> Carthage, <hi>in the time of</hi> Cyprian'<hi>s Retirement.</hi> To the ſecond Inſtance he Anſwereth, that <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an left a Delegation for their Meeting:</hi> which he proveth ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>he wrote,</hi> (Ep. 5.) <hi>that they ſhould faithfully perform his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and their own: where,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we have diſtinct Offices, and an expreſs ſetling of a Delegation. A.</hi> For diſtinct Offices, his Miſtake of the Latine Word hath miſled him; it is <hi>fungamini illic &amp; veſtris partibus &amp; meis:</hi> I ſee not but one Presbyter may ſay this to another. For his Delegation, I think few others can perceive it in theſe words; may not any Member of a Presbytery, but eſpecially the Moderator, ſay the ſame, by a Letter to the Presbytery? It importeth no more but a Warning to be vigilant in their Work. See §. 46. His next Citations is out of <hi>Ep.</hi> 14. (It is <hi>Ep.</hi> 6.) Where <hi>Cyprian commands them to perform the Office of Vicars to him. Cyprian</hi>'s words are, <hi>hortor &amp; mando ut vice mea fungamini circa gerenda ea quae adminiſtratio religioſa depoſcit.</hi> Here is no more but what any of Chriſt's Ambaſſadours may ſay; he chargeth them to do their Duty; and he had Authority from Chriſt, not as Biſhop, but as a Paſtor of the Church, and Chriſt's Ambaſſadour, to enjoyn this. If <hi>Cyprian</hi> had our Author's mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then all Religious Adminiſtration muſt ceaſe, without the Biſhop's preſence, or Delegation: which is abſurd. For his <hi>mea vice,</hi> it ſignifieth no more, but that his Abſence might be ſupplied by their Diligence. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s <hi>warm recenting what ſome of them did without his allowance;</hi> ſhall be elſewhere conſidered: it was, that ſome Presbyters without both their Moderator, and the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, received ſome of the Lapſed: which was wholly irregular, and blame worthy. He next, to the Presbyters Meeting, <hi>ſede
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150243:38"/>
vacante,</hi> Anſwereth; that <hi>they might meet; but they might only determine in ruled caſes.</hi> That is <hi>gratis dictum:</hi> but if they might act in any caſe, it is an Argument that they had Church Power in their Perſons; and that it was not <hi>ſolely</hi> in the Biſhop. The laſt of the Biſhop's Prerogatives that he pleadeth for, (tho' he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, <hi>p. 50. that he could collect more,</hi>) is, <hi>his Delegating, not his Presbyters in common, but two of them,</hi> Rogatianus <hi>and</hi> Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus, <hi>with two Biſhops,</hi> Caldonius <hi>and</hi> Herculanus, <hi>to conſider the ſtate of the Poor at</hi> Carthage, <hi>and to pronounce the Sentence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication againſt</hi> Feliciſſimus <hi>and</hi> Augendus: <hi>which they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted againſt them, and ſome others.</hi> If this Diſcourſe prove ſuch a Power of Delegation, it will alſo prove ſuch a Power in one Biſhop over another; which our Author will not allow; ſeing he aſſerteth, <hi>p. 27, 28, 35. that every Biſhop is ſupreme, and hath no Eccleſiaſtical Superior on Earth.</hi> 2. Sending a Meſſenger to do for us, what we are reſtrained from doing, is not always an Act of Authority: one Friend may ſend another, if he yield to it, as well as a Maſter may ſend his Servant. 3. That which hath moſt Weight in our main Cauſe, (tho' it be impertinent to the preſent purpoſe,) is, that theſe Perſons were to Excommunicat <hi>Feliciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp;c.</hi> To which I Anſwer, that this Excommunication might be Determined by the Presbytery, and it was <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s part, as Moderator, to intimate it; for which he ſubſtituteth the Perſons named. Here is no <hi>ſole Power</hi> of Excommunication. This is Countenanced by <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s own words, in that <hi>Ep.</hi> §. 2. that <hi>Feliciſſimus had deſpiſed both him and the Presbytery. Nec meo honore motus, nec veſtra authoritate fractus:</hi> It ſeems he had been tried before them, and Sentenced for Contumacy. Further, he was alſo ſuſpected of Adultery; which <hi>Cyprian</hi> would not judge by himſelf; but referred it to their Meeting, <hi>ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 48. Having now examined our Author's firſt Principle, I proceed to the ſecond, which he advanceth, <hi>p. 50, &amp;c.</hi> It is, that <hi>in every thing relating to the Government of the Church, and her Diſcipline, the Biſhop had a Negative over all the other Church-Governours,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:150243:39"/>
within his Diſtrict: he had the ſupreme Power of the Keyes.</hi> He ſetteth about the proving of this Point with a high Degree of Confidence: but <hi>let not him that putteth on his Armour boaſt as he that putteth it off.</hi> He pretendeth to ſhew, that <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters could not Baptize, nor Adminiſter the Lord's Supper, nor Excommunicate, nor Abſolve, nor Make, nor Reſcind Eccleſiaſtical Laws, without the Biſhop's Allowance.</hi> For a foundation to our Anſwer to all his Diſcourſe on this Head, I ſhall re-mind the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a Diſtinction of Presbyters above-mentioned. They were in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, of three ſorts. 1. The Ruling Elders, who were no Preachers, and who with the Biſhop, (or Pariſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,) and other Preaching Presbyters, (if there were any,) made up the Conſiſtory, by which the Affairs of the Congregation were managed. Theſe, I confeſs could Adminiſter no Sacrament, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without, nor with the Biſhop's Licence. And for Acts of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Church, it is probable enough, that they could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without him who was <hi>Praeſes</hi> in their Meetings, except, may be, in ſome extraordinary Caſes. 2. There were in ſome Churches, (eſpecially in great Cities) ſome Presbyters who were Ordained to the Work of the Miniſtry, but had no particular Charge, and were as our Probationers, or Students in Divinity Schools, (on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with this Difference, that ours are not Ordained,) theſe might not Baptize, nor Adminiſter the Euchariſt, yea, nor Preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Allowance of the Biſhop, or Pariſh Miniſter. And it is ſo alſo among us: if ſome Ordained Miniſters happen to live in a Pariſh, whereof they are not Paſtors, (as ſometimes falleth out in great Cities,) it is diſorderly for them to exerciſe their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery within another man's Charge, without his Call or Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Theſe Presbyters, in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, were in ſomethings, like Evangeliſts, whom the Biſhops imployed, when themſelves could not overtake all their Work: and if theſe be called the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Curats, (as our Author doth all Presbyters,) I ſhall not much reclaim. Theſe were, as <hi>the Sons of the Prophets,</hi> bred by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop for the Miniſtery: of this ſort of Presbyters, ſee P. <hi>Baynes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150243:39"/>
Dioceſan's Tryal, p.</hi> 63. A third ſort of Presbyters, were the Miniſters of the ſeveral Pariſhes, among whom the Moderator of the Presbytery, or other Church Judicatory, was in a peculiar manner, called the Biſhop: and they alſo often were called Biſhops, with reſpect to their own Parochial Charge. Now, if our Author mean, that a Biſhop in a City had ſuch Power over the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or Miniſters in the Villages, or Places about, that they might not Baptize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without his Allowance, I utterly deny it; and maintain that every ſuch Presbyter, Miniſter, or Parochial Biſhop, (by what ever name ye deſign him,) had in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, as full Power in his Pariſh, as the great Biſhop had in his, tho' the one was more in eſteem than the other.</p>
            <p>§. 49. I ſhall now conſider his Proofs for what he affirmeth. He beginneth with <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and pretendeth to prove, that <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters could not Baptize without the Biſhop's Leave.</hi> His firſt Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Biſhops give the first Baptiſm to Believers.</hi> Which we deny not, if ye underſtand it of Pariſh Miniſters. But if he mean Biſhops in Cities, who were the Praeſidents in Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, we deny that <hi>Cyprian</hi> aſſerteth that. His next Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is out of <hi>Cyprian, Ep.</hi> 73. and <hi>Firmil.</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Thurobaris:</hi> But it is evident, and he confeſſeth it, that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion by them treated, is, whether Presbyters, who by Hereſie, or Schiſm, had departed from the Communion of the Church, might Baptize, and if they they did, whether that Baptiſm was valid, or the Perſon was to be again Baptized, and that Baptiſm eſteemed null: And in this we do ſo far agree with theſe Fathers, as to think that all the Adminiſtrations of ſuch Hereticks, or Schiſmaticks are irregular, and to be condemned: and that none ought ſo to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Church, while ſhe keepeth the Way of Truth, and requireth no unlawful Terms of Communion of her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or other Members. But none of theſe Fathers, did ever Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that in the Church, a ſound Presbyter could not Baptize with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Biſhop's Leave, within the Limits of his own Charge. That they mean no more than I ſay, is evident, for they plead,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:150243:40"/>
that <hi>none can Baptize out of the Church, nor Bind or Looſe out of the Church,</hi> and they ſay expreſly, that <hi>none can Baptize, but they who are Founded in the Evangelical Law:</hi> and I hope it will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, that Miniſters of Congregations are Founded on that Law, as well as theſe of great Cities, who were then called Biſhops, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Praecedency in Church Meetings. That Biſhops <hi>are named<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in theſe Reaſonings, as having the Power of Baptizing,</hi> maketh nothing againſt us, becauſe all Pariſh Miniſters were ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and none without their Allowance ought to intrude on their Charge, in this, or any other Adminiſtration: and becauſe the Authority for Baptizing, and other Church Work was Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from the Presbytery, by their Praeſident, the Biſhop: he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed gave the Power; but not by his own ſole Authority, but by that of the Presbytery. The teſtimony of <hi>Tertullian</hi> cometh next: who ſaith, <hi>de Baptiſmo,</hi> cap. 17. <hi>the High Priest, who is the Biſhop, hath the Power of Baptizing, and after him, (or in Subordination to him,</hi> ſaith our Author,) <hi>Presbyters and Deacons.</hi> A. 1. <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth not ſpeak of Biſhops, as diſtinct from the Paſtors of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Flocks; but from Presbyters who had no Charge: if this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor put another meaning on his words, let him prove it. 2. <hi>Tertullian</hi> a little above, <hi>puto autem licuit &amp; tingere, cui licuit praedicare:</hi> I hope he will not ſay, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> thought, that no Miniſter might Preach without the Biſhop's Leave; tho' he might think that the unſetled Presbyters, ought to Preach in no man's Charge without his Leave. 3. <hi>Tertullian</hi> a little below, alloweth <hi>Laicks,</hi> yea, <hi>Women,</hi> to Baptize, in caſe of neceſſity, without the Biſhop's Leave: as he doth in the place cited, the Deacons to do it with the Biſhop's Leave, all which I look on as ſpoken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Warrant. 4. <hi>Tertullian</hi> groundeth his Diſcourſe on this; that <hi>the honour of the Church requireth, that the Biſhop's Allowance ſhould be had;</hi> and on this occaſion, condemneth <hi>Emulation, as the Mother of Schiſm:</hi> and citeth that place, <hi>all things are lawful, but all things are not expedient.</hi> From all which it is eaſie to gather, that he only condemned them who Baptized without Church Authority,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:150243:40"/>
which the Biſhop, as Mouth of the Presbytery, did Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. 5. It is wholly without Warrant that this Learned Author addeth to <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Words, <hi>and in Subordination to him: dehinc</hi> (which is that Father's Word) doth neither ſignifie, nor can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſo much: all that can be built on it, is a prior Dignity to the Biſhop; in this, and other parts of the Miniſterial Work. His laſt Citation is <hi>Ignatius, it is not lawful to Baptize without the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. A.</hi> That is, without the Authority of the Presbytery, which the Biſhop as their <hi>Praeſes,</hi> conveyeth.</p>
            <p>§. 50. He Aſſerteth next, (<hi>p.</hi> 52.) that <hi>no Presbyter could Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Euchariſt within the the Biſhop's District, without his Leave, or against his Interdict.</hi> To this, what hath already been ſaid, is a full Anſwer. No Presbyter might do this within the Charge of a Pariſh Biſhop, without his Leave: nor yet in a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial Diſtrict, without the Allowance of the Presbytery, given out by their <hi>Epiſcopus Praeſes.</hi> His Proofs are exactly like the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; <hi>Cyprian</hi> (ſeverely and juſtly) <hi>laſheth ſome Schiſmatical Presbyters, who by themſelves, without</hi> Cyprian, <hi>and without the Presbytery, did Administer the Lord's Supper to ſome of the Lapſed, who were not duely Reconciled to the Church:</hi> I know no Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery that would not condemn this, if it were done within their Bounds; yea, they would think their Authority contemned; and their Moderator ſlighted, who ſhould have been Applyed to, to call the Presbytery for Conſulting about this: who, with them, ſhould have Authoritatively Determined in this Matter: and this Neglect of the Biſhop was in that time, the more conſpicuous, that his Praecedency was conſtant, and known to all; which was the cauſe the Biſhop is ſo often named, in theſe things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned not him alone, but the whole Community. It is to the ſame purpoſe, which he next alledgeth of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandrià, giving a Command that any Lapſed, in danger of Death, if Supplicating for it, ſhould have the Euchariſt.</hi> For that may be underſtood of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> enjoyning this to the unfixed Presbyters of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that it ſhould be done within that Pariſh, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150243:41"/>
               <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was Paſtor: or of the Presbytery, by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> their <hi>Praeſes,</hi> to be obſerved within their Diſtrict. What <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>that is only to be eſteemed a firm, and valid Eucharist, which is Celebrated by the Biſhop, or by his Authority:</hi> this, I ſay, admitteth of the ſame Anſwer; that none ought to Celebrate that Holy Ordinance in any Congregation, but the Paſtor of it, or whom he doth call to do it for him: I might call in Queſtion the Authority of theſe Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius</hi> which he citeth; but I will not digreſs into that Controverſie; <hi>ſub judice lis eſt, Theologi cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</hi> There is nothing of any more Weight in his next Citation; where <hi>Cyprian,</hi> againſt the <hi>Novatians,</hi> declareth that <hi>there could be no true Sacrament among them, becauſe they are out of the Church; and had aſſumed to themſelves an Epiſcopal Chair, and a Power of Baptizing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Offering.</hi> It is plain that this is meant of them, who had caſt off the Churches Authority, that was exerciſed by her Paſtors, (who are here called Biſhops,) but it no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that ſome Paſtors of the Church, muſt depend on one of them, for this Authority. It is tedious to repeat the ſame thing ſo often; in Anſwer to ſo many Arguments, which are materially the ſame. After all theſe numerous Teſtimonies, he cometh <hi>p.</hi> 55. to an Artificial Argument, in which kind of Arguings, he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to be very formidable; he ſuppoſeth <hi>he hath fully proved the Biſhop to be the Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity; the Chief Governour, that by Conſequence the ſupreme Power of the Keyes belongeth to him: that he was the viſible Head of the Church; it is highly reaſonable on that account, that he ſhould have the chief Power of Diſpenſing the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and that they might not be Diſpenſed without him.</hi> I have already ſhewed the Weakneſs of all theſe Grounds he buildeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and therefore the Conſequence built on them, muſt fall to the ground: we are no leſs ſenſible than he is, of <hi>the evil of Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and continuing unworthy Perſons in the Church; and that the Governours of the Church must be Judges in this matter;</hi> but we are not yet convinced, that the Biſhop by himſelf, rather than the Community of Church Rulers, are that Judge: and I muſt take
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:150243:41"/>
leave to tell him, that (however it was in the Primitive Times,) in our Days, the excluding of unworthy Perſons, Miniſters and others, hath been much more to be obſerved, where the Church is ruled by a Parity of Presbyters; than where it is governed by one Prelate.</p>
            <p>§. 51. This Learned Author, ſuppoſing that he had proved the Biſhop's <hi>Negative</hi> in Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, hence inferreth <hi>his Soveraign Interest in Excommunication, Abſolution, Enjoyning Pennance, &amp;c.</hi> Which Conſequence I ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with him: but I hope the Reader is now ſatisfied, that he hath not ſufficiently eſtabliſhed the Antecedent: nor will we yield that <hi>Cyprian, or his Contemporaries had, or laid Claim to ſuch a Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</hi> But our Author, tho' he thinketh he might ſuperſede the Proof of his <hi>Negative</hi> in theſe other things, yet, becauſe <hi>he will give all poſſible Satisfaction,</hi> he undertaketh a <hi>Deduction of further Powers in the Perſon of</hi> Cyprian: of which we have a long Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, beginning at <hi>p.</hi> 56. I have nothing to obſerve on the account he giveth of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s <hi>Converſion, Promotion,</hi> (ſave what I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of <hi>Pontius,</hi> of his Promotion to be Presbyter and Biſhop <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel:</hi> but what ever be in that, it hath no great Influence on our Cauſe,) <hi>the Oppoſition he met with, his Eminency for Grace and Gifts, the wicked Courſes his Enemies took, while, under the Perſecution by</hi> Decius, <hi>he retired from</hi> Carthage; <hi>how they got ſome of the Confeſſors and Martyrs to Countenance them; and they upon this, were emboldened by themſelves, to Abſolve ſome of the Lapſed.</hi> Nothing of this I contradict, except what I now ſaid. He hath run thus far without a Check; and therefore ariveth at the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſay, <hi>p. 58. now conſider what followeth, and ſpeak your Conſcience, and tell me, if St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>was not more than either ſingle Presbyter, or Presbyterian Moderator,</hi> I ſhall yield him yet a little more, in what he ſaith of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s <hi>Meekneſs and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; of his being alarmed with this Practice, that this was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralelled Practice, and that</hi> Cyprian <hi>did zealouſly and vigorouſly oppoſe it.</hi> And for all this I ſhall ſpeak my Conſcience, and ſhall
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:150243:42"/>
give Reaſon for my Light, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> was no Dioceſan Biſhop, in our modern ſenſe; and that he neither had, nor claimed <hi>ſole Power,</hi> nor a <hi>Negative,</hi> in the Government of the Church; and that, bating what I yielded in ſtating the Queſtion, §. 9, 10. He was no more but a ſingle Presbyter, that is a Pariſh Miniſter, or Presbyterian Moderator. And indeed all that he here bringeth, and looketh on as ſo ſtrongly Argumentative, is already Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he having cited all, or moſt of the places before, which he here quoteth. He bringeth three Epiſtles of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to prove his Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>§. 52. The firſt is that <hi>to the Confeſſors and Martyrs:</hi> where I find nothing but a ſharp Reproof of them for going without their Line: and he blameth thoſe Presbyters who had abſolved the Lapſed ſo diſorderly: only what ſeemeth here to contain an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that they ſhould have <hi>Petitioned the Biſhop for reſtoring of theſe Lapſed, and not done it without him.</hi> The Anſwer here is eaſie; and often before given, that the fault of theſe turbulent Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters was, that they took this Act of Church Power on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without the Presbytery; whereas the regular way had been to Petition the Biſhop, that he might call the Presbytery, and that he with them might cognoſce of that Affair. I have laid down ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warrant for thus underſtanding his words, from his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red purpoſe, founded on <hi>Conſcience of Duty, to do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Concurrence of the Presbytery,</hi> ſee §. 12. And it is like, I may after bring yet further Evidence, that his Principles led him to this Conduct: At preſent, I take notice of that plain Paſſage, <hi>Ep. 15. ad Clerum,</hi> ſpeaking of receiving the Lapſed, <hi>quaeres</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>cum omnium nostrum Concilium, &amp; Sententiam ſpectet, praejudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ego, &amp; ſoli mihi rem communem vindicare non audeo.</hi> And he deſireth that that Affair might be put off; <hi>donec pace nobis à Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino redditâ, in unum convenire, &amp; ſingulorum cauſas examinare poſſumus:</hi> if <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſeem to my Adverſary to ſpeak <hi>in pure Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Stile,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 6. He ſeemeth to me here, to ſpeak in the Stile of a Presbyterian Moderator. Of the ſame Importance is the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:150243:42"/>
next Epiſtle cited, which was to the <hi>Clergy of</hi> Carthage, (he doth not call them his Clergy, as our Author wordeth it; and if he had, there had been no Argument in it,) he ſharply reproveth (not the Presbyters in common, as our Author fouly repreſenteth the matter; for he writeth in a loving Stile to them: but) ſome of the Presbyters who had received ſome of the Lapſed moſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly; and that becauſe they had not taken the due courſe for receiving theſe Lapſed, which ſhould have been done <hi>per impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem manuum Epiſcopi &amp; Cleri,</hi> not by the Biſhops ſole Authority. He doth indeed here <hi>ſpeak like a Biſhop;</hi> that is a faithful Paſtor; but not as a Biſhop pretending to <hi>ſole Juriſdiction;</hi> or a <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> in the Government of the Church. His third Epiſtle is <hi>to the People;</hi> where we have the ſame Complaint of the Irregularity of the Schiſmatical Presbyters; and complaineth that <hi>the honour of his Prieſthood, and of his Chair, was not reſerved to him.</hi> This can never evince that <hi>Cyprian</hi> pretended to a Power to manage that Affair by himſelf: I ſee nothing here inconſiſtent with the Power, or the Stile of the Moderator of a Presbytery, or Paſtor of a Congregation: ſave that the Moderator then, being conſtant, his part in the management of publick Affairs was more obvious, and therefore more taken notice of. He hath yet a further Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein <hi>Cyprian</hi> telleth the Clergy, that <hi>they ought to inform him of every thing that happens; that ſo I may</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Adviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Deliberatly, give Orders concerning the Affairs of the Church;</hi> let any one compare this Tranſlation with <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s own words, which are faithfully enough ſet down by our Author in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: Is <hi>limare Conſilium</hi> to <hi>give Order?</hi> It is to poliſh, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Advice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make it more exact: he then, in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, wills them to write often and diſtinctly to him of all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, that he, as making ſuch a figure in their Society, might give the more accurate Advice about what was to be done: this is no <hi>Prelatical,</hi> but a <hi>plain Presbyterian Stile.</hi>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:150243:43"/>
Non-conformity,</hi> p. 179. where he thinketh <hi>Cyprian</hi> is reflected on <hi>as ſhewing too much Zeal in that Cauſe (viz.</hi> of his Epiſcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority being neglected) <hi>and that poſſibly he ſtretched his Power a little too far, as afterward many did: he was a holy, and meek man; but ſuch may be a little too high:</hi> This he ſtretcheth his Invention to expoſe, as <hi>contradictory to it ſelf; injurious to</hi> Cyprian, <hi>and an uncharitable, or ignorant Sugestion:</hi> his more ſedate Thoughts after all this Huffineſs, may inform him better: That Author as he was not ſo ſtraitned with his learned Adverſaries Arguments, as he imagineth (they being the very ſame which now I have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined) ſo he was far from ſpeaking Contradictions, nor did he ſeek to reconcile <hi>Pride and Patience, Superciliouſneſs and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal, Huffineſs and Humility, carnal hight and Christian Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> He was far from thinking on ſuch ill Qualities with reſpect to that excellent perſon: Further than that the beſt of men have ſinful Infirmity mixed with their Graces, and beſt Gifts. He might know and I ſhall not charge him with Ignorance in this) that Sin and Grace are conſiſtent <hi>in gradu ſaltem remiſſiore:</hi> And that tho' it were ridiculous to ſay, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the meekeſt Man on Earth, and yet he was <hi>Huffie,</hi> and <hi>Proud,</hi> and <hi>Paſſionate:</hi> or that <hi>Job</hi> was <hi>moſt patient,</hi> and yet <hi>he was impatient</hi>- Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it may be ſaid, with our Author's leave; that neither of theſe holy Men was ſo perfect in the grace for which he is commended, as to have nothing of the contrary evil: Further I am of Opinion, that what might be imputed to the excellent <hi>Cyprian,</hi> was rather the Fault of the Age he lived in, than his perſonal Fault, there was then a Tendency toward <hi>Church-Domination,</hi> which did ſhew it ſelf much more afterward: Tho' I ſtill maintain it was not arrived at that Pitch that this Author imputeth to that time. He ſpendeth a great many words to prove that <hi>Cyprian</hi> did not ſtretch his Power too far in this matter: all which is loſt labour; for that was no otherways imputed to him, than with a poſſibility; and on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his mentioning his own Epiſcopal Power more than he did the power of the Presbytery (which power of the Presbytery
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:150243:43"/>
he doth yet clearly owne, as I have proved) This had a ſhew of Uſurpation; and did in time introduce it: It was the <hi>Genius</hi> of that age, to have too big thoughts of that <hi>Praelation</hi> of being <hi>primus Presbyter:</hi> And the beſt of men in that time were tinctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with this miſtake. Wherefore he might have ſuperceded his proving what <hi>Figure the Martyrs then made,</hi> I know their Intereſt went far, as to receiving the lapſed; yet I ſtill think that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretended to, nor was then aſcribed to them, formal Church-Authority. What he largely diſcourſeth, p, 64. of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s dealing with the diſorderly Presbyters, <hi>not by Huffing, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Argument,</hi> is as little to our purpoſe; in that, he did rationally, and Chriſtianly: Yet in theſe Reaſonings, as he in words, taketh more notice of his Epiſcopal Authority, than of the Presbytries Power, ſo upon the matter doth not derogate from the one, nor unduely highten the other: as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed. I wonder at the Inſinuation that my learned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt maketh, p. 65. as if any had imagined it queſtionable, <hi>whether</hi> Cyprian, <hi>or the Presbyters that he blameth, were guilty of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation:</hi> They did uſurp moſt intollerably in doing that by themſelves, which ſhould have been done by <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the Presbytery: And it was no Uſurpation to reprove, and threaten them with Cenſure for ſo doing. The power of the Presbytery was not here queſtioned; but the power of particular Presbyters who took the Power of the Presbytry upon them: And therefore the Presbytery who were not guilty, had no <hi>Right of their own</hi> to defend againſt <hi>Cyprian;</hi> but had juſt cauſe to joyn with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Uſurpers. It is as inſignificant, that <hi>the ſeditious Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters repented, excuſed themſelves, and deſired a Form from</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian: For it is ordinary for ſome to go from one Extreme to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Beſides that <hi>ſeeking a Form</hi> from him was to ask it from him, and the Presbytery, not from him alone. That <hi>theſe Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were generally condemned for their factious Practices,</hi> I think none doubteth, and it is to little purpoſe to prove it ſo laboriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as our Author doth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:150243:44"/>§. 54. Yet becauſe in his Proofs of it ſome things are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed which may look like Arguments againſt what I plead for, I ſhall make ſome Obſerves on this Diſcourſe. He giveth us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s <hi>writing to the Presbytery at</hi> Rome, <hi>they having then no Biſhop.</hi> This I hope is a Token that <hi>Cyprian</hi> thought not that all Church Power at <hi>Rome</hi> dyed with the Biſhop; but that Presbyters are Church Rulers, and not the Biſhop only: In the return that the Presbytery at <hi>Rome,</hi> made to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> he fancieth that he findeth ſome Arguments for Epiſcopal <hi>ſole Power:</hi> which I ſhall a little conſider: He ſaith <hi>they aſcribe to him a ſupreme and unaccountable Power:</hi> I find no words that can be ſo conſtructed in either of the two Epiſtles that they write to him on that Subject; but on the contrary, they ſeem to inſinuate a Parity with him, while they frequently call him <hi>Frater.</hi> It would be thought great ſaucineſs, in our days, for Presbyters to write in that Stile to ſo great a Biſhop as <hi>Cyprian</hi> was eſteemed to have been, by our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats. Next, <hi>they compare him to the Maſter of a Ship; who doeth not act in parity with the other Sea-men;</hi> A. <hi>omne ſimile claudicat.</hi> a Moderator of a Presbytery may be ſo compared, as having a main hand in the Conduct of Affairs. Again the words of that Epiſtle import no more than making <hi>Cyprian</hi> the <hi>Steerſman:</hi> who tho' he be at the Helm, and the Safety of the Ship dependeth much on his Skill and Management, yet he is not always the Commander of the Ship; and the Safety of the Ship ſhould yet more depend on the <hi>Steerſman,</hi> if he were fixed, and always ſo imployed; as <hi>Cyprian</hi> was in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Ship</hi> at <hi>Carthage.</hi> He ſaith, that <hi>the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Clergy tell</hi> Cyprian (<hi>and pray take notice of it,</hi> ſaith he) <hi>that they could determine nothing in that matter, wanting a Biſhop.</hi> This is a Miſrepreſentation: for they tell their Mind plainly in the firſt of their two Epiſtles to <hi>Cyprian;</hi> that <hi>he did well in repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that Inſolency of ſome Presbyters; that the lapſed ſhould not be ſuddenly received,</hi> and give the Reaſon, <hi>recens eſt hoc lapſorum vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, &amp; adhuc in tumorem plaga conſurgens; &amp; idcirco certi ſumus, quod ſpatio productioris temporis, impetu isto conſeneſcente, amabunt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:150243:44"/>
hoc ipſum ad fidelem ſe delatos medicinam.</hi> And in the ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle they add another Reaſon why it was fit to delay that Affair of of cenſuring the lapſed, becauſe they wanted a Biſhop, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Biſhop was to be the ſole Judge in that matter; but becauſe the Biſhop was he, <hi>qui omnia iſta moderetur</hi> (theſe are their own words) he was to preſide in that Affair. Seing then there was another reaſon for delaying, even where there was a Biſhop, as in <hi>Carthage,</hi> it was a ſuperadded reaſon why at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſhould be delayed, the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie being incomplete, by the want of a ſignificant Member. If it be ſaid, could they not chooſe a Moderator? <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Office through cuſtom being then fixed, and the Honour and Revenue that belonged to it being ſo conſiderable, it was not eaſie to get it done of a ſudden; and the iniquity of that time of Perſecution did add to the difficulty, as themſelves expreſs it; <hi>Nondum enim Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus, propter rerum &amp; temporum difficultates conſtitutus.</hi> Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor vitiareth their words, when he maketh them ſay, <hi>who onely could define,</hi> &amp;c. There is no ſuch words in this Epiſtle: it is ſaid indeed of the Biſhop, <hi>eorum qui lapſi ſunt poſſit cum authoritate &amp; conſilio habere rationem.</hi> But that ſaith nothing of <hi>ſole Authority,</hi> but ſuch as was to be acted in the Presbytery, and with their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>§. 55. He obſerveth likewiſe, that <hi>they commend</hi> Cyprian, <hi>that he did not determine in that matter by himſelf alone; but took the advice of many: and this they impute not to the incompetency of his Authority for it; but to his condeſcendence. Anſ.</hi> He doth whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtake this Matter, for the <hi>Roman Clergy,</hi> in their Letter to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> do not at all take notice of what he did, or might do, with reſpect to his own Diſtrict, nor his adviſing with his own Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; but that he had taken the advice, in ſuch a weighty caſe, of general concernment, of other Biſhops, and of the <hi>Clergy at Rome,</hi> And it is certain, that he, with the Presbytery at <hi>Carthage,</hi> might have determined in this Matter with reſpect to themſelves; and it was Prudence, and not want of Power, that made him adviſe with others. He bringeth another Teſtimony to the plenitude of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:150243:45"/>
Power, from an Epiſtle from the <hi>Clergy of Rome,</hi> while they wanted a Biſhop, to the <hi>Clergy of Carthage,</hi> when their Biſhop was in his retirement: <hi>in which caſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they had the best occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſpeaking their mind freely, of the power of Presbyters, and the uſurpation of Biſhops:</hi> in this Epiſtle he fancieth that he findeth Arguments for Epiſcopal <hi>ſole Power:</hi> as firſt, they ſay, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and theſe at <hi>Carthage,</hi> that <hi>they were only ſeemingly the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of theſe reſpective Churches; and only keep the Flock inſtead of the reſpective Pastors, the Biſhops.</hi> I had occaſion to conſider this Paſſage before, I blame his want of Wiſdom, that ſeing he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give us this Tranſlation of this Paſſage, he hath yet ſet down the Latine in the Margine: out of which one may eaſily diſcover his Error, without turning to the Epiſtle it ſelf: It is a ſtrange Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, <hi>Videmur Praepoſiti,</hi> that is, <hi>we only ſeem to be Governours.</hi> I am ſure, the Marginal Notes on this Epiſtle ſaith, they were <hi>Pastores constituti.</hi> And <hi>Pamelius</hi> from this Paſſage argueth for the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> over other Churches; and he that animadverteth on <hi>Pamelius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Clerus Romanus Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſem agnoſcit, quemadmodum &amp; alios aliarum Eccleſiarum paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, eſſe Christiani gregi praepoſitos:</hi> wherefore <hi>videmur</hi> muſt rather ſignifie certainty than doubting, in this place; it appeareth not only to our ſelves, but to all, we are acknowledged for ſuch. And that they did not mean by <hi>vice Pastoris,</hi> a vicarious Power delegated from the Biſhop, is manifeſt, for the Biſhop was dead, and we find no Power he left them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither could he do it. Yea it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that they lookt on a Power reſiding in themſelves, of which they were to give an account: <hi>ſi negligentes inveniamur—quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam perditum non requiſivimus,</hi> &amp;c. What is ſaid of the lapſed continuing in their Penitency, that they might obtain Indulgence from them who can give it: the Word being <hi>ab eo qui potest prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtare.</hi> It might be underſtood of Pardon from Chriſt, on their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Repentance, ſeing he alone can make Indulgence effectual: but if that ſeem ſtrained, the Biſhop with the Presbytery, not by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, may fitly here be underſtood. He doth again, <hi>pag.</hi> 69. miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:150243:45"/>
the Queſtion, in theſe Words, <hi>Let any man judge whether St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>or his preſuming Presbyters had taken too much on them at</hi> Carthage: But this miſtake I noted before. Another Argument he bringeth, is from ſome <hi>Martyrs and Confeſſors,</hi> in an Epiſtle to <hi>Cyprian, commending him for his conduct in oppoſing and cenſuring theſe Presbyters.</hi> I alſo commend him for it: <hi>Ergo</hi> I think he had <hi>ſole Power</hi> to manage that Affair: the conſequence is naught. He haleth in another Argument into this Diſcourſe: <hi>theſe Martyrs and Confeſſors deſire, that</hi> Cyprian <hi>being ſo glorious a Biſhop, would pray for them: which they would not have done had they thought him a proud aſpiring Prelat, that is a Limb of Antichrist, as this Author would fain give him out to have been:</hi> It is an injurious Calumny: I never ſaid, nor thought ſo: and no man can Wire-draw my words (with any ſenſe or reaſon) to that meaning. I eſteem <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Grace, Virtues, and Learning as much as he doth: and do judge that his Prayers, while he was on Earth, were worth asking: and that he was a glorious Biſhop; but all this will not infer his <hi>ſole Power,</hi> nor his <hi>negative.</hi>—Cyprian'<hi>s excommunicating theſe Presbyters, and that fact being approven by others,</hi> is not argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, unleſs he can prove that this <hi>Cyprian</hi> did by himſelf, without the Presbytery. He next bringeth the <hi>Canons of the Apostles</hi> (the inſufficiency of which Authority I have above-ſhewed.) And <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> that <hi>nothing ſhould be done without the Biſhop, nor in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him:</hi> And <hi>that the Biſhop ſhould be honoured.</hi> All this is ſufficiently Anſwered above. When a Biſhop that is any Miniſter of the Goſpel, acteth in his Sphere, and keepeth to the Rule the Word of God, to oppoſe him, to depart from him, not to honour him, is highly ſinful. But I am ſure <hi>Cyprian</hi> nor <hi>Ignatius</hi> never meant to enjoin abſolute &amp; illimited obedience to a Biſhop, nor any man elſe. As for <hi>doing nothing without the Biſhop,</hi> we grant that they who are under a Miniſters charge, Prebyters or others, ſhould act nothing in the Conſiſtory without him; but this alſo muſt ſuffer a limitation; if he ſhould prove ſo perverſe as to oppoſe, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every thing that is good, or what is neceſſary to be done; I do
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:150243:46"/>
not think that <hi>Ignatius</hi> would blame the Presbyters for acting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him: otherwiſe there were no remedy but the Church muſt be ruined. If it be ſaid, in that caſe they ſhould complain. To whom muſt this Complaint be made: for <hi>a Biſhop hath no Superior on Earth;</hi> if we believe this Author.</p>
            <p>§. 56. The laſt of his three Principles, which he advanceth <hi>p.</hi> 72. is, that. <hi>all the Church-Governours within his Diſtrict, Presbyters as well as others, were in St.</hi> Cyprian'<hi>s time, ſubject to the Biſhops Authority, and obnoxious to his Diſcipline.</hi> This Principle and all that he ſaith for eſtabliſhing of it, we might ſafely yield, without any hazard to our Cauſe: for we always maintained, that a Biſhop, conſidered as a Paroch Miniſter, hath Authority over the Ruling-Elders, and the unfixed Preaching-Presbyters, if any be within his Pariſh; alſo conſidered as Moderator of the Presbytry, he is ſtill a Miniſter, and hath Rule over all the Miniſters, and People and Elders within the Diſtrict, over which that Presbytery hath the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight: but our Queſtion is, whether he, by himſelf, hath the <hi>ſole Authority;</hi> or he, as a Member of the Conſiſtory, or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, hath a ſhare in that Authority which reſideth in that Body, or Community. This laſt we grant: the former we deny. His Proofs can never reach the concluſion that we deny: the firſt of which is, that <hi>Cyprian ſaith, that our Lord choſe Apostles, that is Biſhops and Governours</hi> (where by the way Note, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> owneth other Church-Governours, beſide Biſhops, and therefore they have not the <hi>ſole Authority) and the Apostles choſe Deacons to be the Biſhops and Churches Ministers.</hi> Any body may ſee that this doth concern all Church-Rulers, not <hi>ſole Power</hi> in the Biſhop. Next he telleth us that <hi>Cyprian called</hi> Fabianus <hi>Superior, with reſpect to the Roman-Clergy:</hi> which is a miſtake: He calleth him ſimply <hi>Praepoſitus</hi> (which as I have above-ſhewed, was a Title given to Biſhops &amp; Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters) and if he had not called him their <hi>Praepoſitus,</hi> that doth not import <hi>ſole Power.</hi> In an Epiſtle to <hi>Rogatianus, Cyprian</hi> inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he was <hi>Ruler of the Church, ergo</hi> he had <hi>ſole Power:</hi> it is a <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>liſh conſequence: this may be ſaid of every Elder of the Church.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:150243:46"/>
He is ſcarce of Arguments when he is forced to falſifie <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s words: <hi>qui in Eccleſia Praeſidemus:</hi> he tranſlateth, <hi>who have the chief Power in the Church;</hi> beſide that it is eaſie to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>chief Power,</hi> and <hi>ſole Power;</hi> to which all are ſubject. Alſo <hi>Praeſumus</hi> he turneth <hi>govern the Church.</hi> That the Biſhop is ſaid to be one, and <hi>ſet over the Church,</hi> may well agree either to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Miniſter, or the Moderator of a Presbytery, who was called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. His next Eſſay is from the Biſhop's calling the Clergy <hi>his Clergy;</hi> for which he is at pains to cite many places. If this were conſtantly done (which was not) what doth it ſignifie: that manner of ſpeaking is as common among Presbyterians, as it was in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time: and it ſignifieth no more but Elders of the Church, whereof <hi>Cyprian</hi> was Paſtor; as the Elders of any Pariſh are called the Elders of ſuch a Miniſter: and Elders uſually call their Miniſter <hi>our Miniſter.</hi> It is a frivolous Queſtion, <hi>by what Rule of Grammer, Rhetorick, Logick or Politick could he be ſo called if he had no Power or Juriſdiction over them. A.</hi> There is no Rule in any of theſe Faculties againſt it: tho' he have no <hi>ſole Power;</hi> If he have a ſhare of the Power that the whole hath over every one, and have the Conduct in managing that Power, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Moderator.</p>
            <p>§. 57. He will let all this <hi>paſs for a mere Praeluſion,</hi> not being <hi>ſcant of Arguments.</hi> Wherefore we muſt now expect what is more pungent: that is, the three Principles he had before proved ſo fully, <hi>viz. The Biſhop being the principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity; having ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power: being the ſame with the High-Prieſt under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> do prove this Point. To this formidable Argument I oppone what hath been diſcourſed on theſe Heads: I leave the Reader to judge whether he hath fully proved theſe, or I have fully overturned them: Next he argueth from <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s ſaying <hi>he could by his Epiſcopal power, Depoſe or Excommunicate a Deacon who had rebelled againſt him, and praiſing another Biſhop for ſo acting,</hi> yea I ſhal allow him what he after faith, that <hi>this power extended alſo to cenſuring of Elders:</hi> Do not our Moderators uſually ſo practiſe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150243:47"/>
when there is cauſe: but not by theit <hi>ſole Power,</hi> but with the Conſiſtory, or Presbytery. We Presbyterians may tremble at his next Blow: For he ſaith, he will <hi>leave his Reader no imaginable ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> But theſe big words dwindle away into this feeble Argument; that <hi>Cyprian might have cenſured</hi> Feliciſſimus <hi>and ſome with him, who first oppoſed his Promotion, and after he had taken them into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, apted diſorderly in receiving ſome of the lapſed, without the Praeſes, and the Presbytery:</hi> of this caſe before: it is wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant here, unleſs he can prove, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> might do this by himſelf, without the Presbytery: which himſelf diſowneth, as I ſhewed above: All that followeth (which is a Repetition of what he hath often alledged having little to ſay, when he braggeth of Superabundance) is already plainly anſwered. He is run a little weak; but he reinforceth his Arguments with Confidence and Repetitions.</p>
            <p>§. 58. Hitherto he hath ſet forth his <hi>Cyprianick Biſhop</hi> in his <hi>Majeſty, Abſolute and ſole Power, &amp;c.</hi> In his own particular Church; p. 78. he giveth us account of him, as he <hi>ſtood related to the Catholick Church:</hi> and here he expecteth matter enough for another Demonſtration: which is a big Word in Diſputation. We ſhall here alſo, by Divine Aſſiſtance, try his Strength; and tho' we will not brag of Demonſtrations; yet ſhall endeavour to bring what Light and Strength the ſubject doth afford. His long Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about the <hi>Colledge of Biſhops,</hi> I have read with Attention; and conſidered with what Application I am capable of, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find his Demonſtrations in it: yea cannot ſee wherein it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to prove his point: only ſome Hints he hath interſperſed that ſeem to have ſomewhat of Argument, which I ſhall conſider, after I have taken a general View of the whole. He obſerveth that <hi>all Biſhops were Collegues, and made up one Colledge.</hi> Next that <hi>this Colledge was the principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity to the Catholick Church.</hi> Thirdly, that <hi>the grand Concern of the Epiſcopal Colledge was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and maintain the one Communion; which together with one Faith, made them capable to be the principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity to the Catholick
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:150243:47"/>
Church:</hi> and that this was their work he proveth firſt, <hi>they thought themſelves bound to maintain Peace. 2. Every Biſhop was a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Colledge; and therefore great care was taken about their promotion. 3. He being promoted ſent communicatory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to other Biſhops, giving account of his Promotion. 4. If there was any Debate whether his Promotion was Canonical, the reſt of the Biſhops enquired into it. 5. If he turned Heretick, or Schiſmatick, he was turned out. 6. While he kept the Faith and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church, he was encouraged, Conſulted, Correſponded with,</hi> &amp;c. 7. <hi>While he continued a ſound Member of the Colledge, all Letters concerning the Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church, were directed to him.</hi> Laſtly, p. 87. <hi>he obſerveth</hi> (cum nota) <hi>reſiſt this Evidence</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if ye can) that every Heretical, or Schiſmatical Biſhop, with all that retained to him, was</hi> ipſo facto <hi>out of the Church:</hi> At laſt, p. 88. He thinketh he <hi>hath another Demonſtration againſt my Notion of a Biſhop in</hi> Cyprian's <hi>time: For how could a ſingle Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, or Presbyterian Moderator, have born ſuch a part in relation to the Catholick Church, and her <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 59. I muſt Examine the Strength of this long Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and what he addeth to fortifie it: and then ſhall return to take notice of what he intermixeth in the ſeveral parts of it, in which our Debate may be concerned: For Anſwer then to this Argument, as it ſtandeth. I deny the Aſſumption, <hi>viz.</hi> That what he hath here aſſerted cannot agree to a ſingle Presbyter, or presbyterian Moderator. His three Aſſertions do well agree to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Presbyter; that is, Paſtor of a Congregation: He is a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue to all Biſhops, that is ſuch Paſtors. The meeting of ſuch (either by their Delegats; or if they could all come together) is as capable to be the principle of Unity to a Provincial, or Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Church, yea, to the Univerſal Church, as if ſo many Dioceſans ſhould meet. It is as much the concern of theſe Presbyters, or Pariſh Biſhops (and I hope they do as much mind it) to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one Faith and one Communion. Doth he think that our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters do not think themſelves bound to maintain Peace: Or 2.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:150243:48"/>
That there is litle care taken about their promotion or giving them charge of the people, and admitting them to a ſhare of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 3. Tho' it be not our cuſtom to ſend communicatory Letters of our ſettlement in a Charge; yet every Presbytery notifieth to the neighbouring Presbyteries the Name of him who is to be fixed in a Charge: that they may have opportunity to object: and the Names of all who are ordained, are recorded. 4. If a Presbytery ordain any perſon unduely, or if there be Competition, the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Judicatories enquire into it. 5. We alſo turn out, not only Heretical and Schiſmatical Miniſters; but them alſo who are ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous in their Converſation, or ſupinely negligent in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Work. 6. We alſo encourage and admit to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, them that do well. 7. Letters that concern a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; are, with us, directed to the Miniſter: theſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Presbytery, to the Moderator: we alſo caſt out bad Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and ſuch as adhere to them; if the Cauſe be weighty: but we uſe moderation to the people who are led away by Schiſmatical Miniſters, when their Separation is founded on leſſer miſtake: &amp; if in this we differ from the <hi>Cyprianick Age,</hi> his Party ſhould not blame us; having taſted ſo much of our lenity. Let it then be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how impertinent this whole Diſcourſe is, and how inſufficient to prove the Epiſcopacy of the <hi>Cyprianick-Age</hi> that he pleadeth for.</p>
            <p>§. 60. He uſeth ſeveral enforcements of this Argument, <hi>p. 88, &amp;</hi> 89. which I ſhall briefly conſider. 1. <hi>The Colledge of Biſhops are still conſidered as Church-Governours notoriouſly distinguiſhed from Presbyters. Anſw.</hi> This diſtinction lay in the dignity that the declenſions of that time from Apoſtolick ſimplicity gave them: not in any Power that they had which Presbyters had not. 2. <hi>A Presbyter was never called a Biſhops Collegue. Anſw.</hi> If this were granted, ſuch a negative Argument, and that drawn from words, and ways of ſpeaking (which doth often vary) is not very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludent. I have ſhewed that the ſame Power is aſcribed to them, <hi>ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> §. 62. where the contrary of what he aſſerteth is ſhewed. 3. <hi>We
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:150243:48"/>
have no Vestige of a Presbyterian Moderator in theſe times. Anſw.</hi> There was then a Moderator, who was called the Biſhop; who preſided in their Meetings: tho' there was no ſuch changing of the Moderator as is among us: that I have yielded: but the fixedneſs of the Moderator, and the parity of the Power are conſiſtent: tho' I deny not that the one made way for deſtroying the other; as After-ages did ſhew. 4. Our Author repeateth all the Acts of, and concerning Biſhops, that he had inſiſted on, and affirmeth that they could not conſiſt with a ſingle Presbyter, or Moderator, which I have above-denyed, and made the contrary evident. That he calleth <hi>all the Acts of Government and Diſcipline his</hi> (the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops) <hi>and his alone;</hi> is to beg the Queſtion, for we deny it, and he ſhould prove it.</p>
            <p>§. 61. I muſt now return to <hi>p.</hi> 78, and glean ſome Paſſages, which I was obliged to overlook, that I might have this long Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (ſtretching from thence to <hi>p.</hi> 90.) intirely in view, and give a general Anſwer to it. He maketh <hi>the Biſhop the Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity to a particular Church, and the Colledge of Biſhops the Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity to the Catholick Church; and Chriſt the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity to that Colledge.</hi> And addeth, <hi>I hope not being a</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt, <hi>you will not require that I ſhould prove the highest Step of this Gradation.</hi> Here I obſerve <hi>firſt,</hi> the Diſcourſe is about a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Head, or <hi>Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> to the Church; which cannot be aſcribed to Chriſt. Wherefore this is wholly impertinent; or, if it have any ſenſe, it tendeth to make his Reader a <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> whom he ſuppoſeth not to be one already. For if the particular and Catholick Church, have a viſible <hi>Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> and that which he maketh to be the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting Principle,</hi> have nothing that is viſible to make them one among themſelves, they who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Doctrine about a <hi>Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> will ſee a neceſſity of a <hi>Pope</hi> to unite the Biſhops, as much as of a Biſhop to unite the Presbyters. 2. If Chriſt be the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting Principle</hi> of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Biſhops, why doth he not ſerve for the ſame uſe to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, yea, to all Chriſtians. And indeed he is the real <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:150243:49"/>
Principle</hi> to all; they only are in the Union of the Church, who cleave to his Doctrine, and obſerve his Laws; even tho' they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Biſhop who departeth out of that Way. 3. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know of him, why he thinketh the <hi>Romanists</hi> will put him to prove the higheſt Step of this Gradation, more than <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will? Doth any of them deny Chriſt to be the <hi>Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> to the Church? They only make the <hi>Pope</hi> his Vicar in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think ſuch an one is needful in the Church, who is viſibly Converſant among men: and doth not our Author ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſame neceſſity of ſuch a viſible Uniter till he come to the Colledge of Biſhops, and he leaveth them Headleſs, that is, without a viſible Head. Where it may be rationally concluded that this Doctrine is either <hi>Popiſh</hi> or palpably abſurd. The next thing I notice is, <hi>p.</hi> 79. he ſaith <hi>all Chriſtians hold one Faith to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church; but in</hi> Cyprian's <hi>time one Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was thought as indiſpenſible: they held there is but one Church, and that this could not be without one Communion.</hi> If by <hi>one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> he mean (for he walketh in a Cloud in this Matter, whether of Deſign or not, I know not,) that Communion of Saints which is an Article of the Creed; which conſiſteth in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them all with Chriſt, and Unity in Faith and Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I acknowledge the neceſſity of it, but I know not what reſpect it hath to Epiſcopacy, more than Presbytery. If he mean Local Communion, it is impoſſible either in the Catholick Church, or in the Dioceſs of a modern Biſhop. If he mean Communion by having the ſame Ceremonies and Government in the Church. Tho' I confeſs that is deſireable, and by all good means ſhould be endeavoured: (for we ſhould have no Ceremonies, but theſe which are of Divine Inſtitution, and the one Church Government that he hath appointed, ſhould be every where exerciſed,) yet there may be one Church, where this Communion is not: and if the <hi>Cyprianick</hi> Age was ſomewhat too ſtrick in this Matter, it was their Miſtake, (of which above,) but it is no Proof of Epiſcopacy, (in the ſenſe of our Debate,) to have been in that Age. And
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:150243:49"/>
indeed, if our Author maintain this Principle, he will (conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially to it) Unchurch moſt of the Reformed Churches, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do them all on the ſame ſcore: if by this <hi>one Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> he mean, that all Chriſtians muſt be United to ſome one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or other, which Biſhops agree among themſelves, and have Communion in the Epiſcopal Colledge; he will find hard to prove that <hi>Cyprian</hi> taught ſo. Yea, then there is no Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Church, without an oecumenick Council of Biſhops, which we have litle hope to ſee: and many doubt that the World did ever ſee it: tho' there have been Councils ſo called; becauſe in them were repreſented all the Churches of the Empire. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if this was the Opinion of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, how will he prove that theſe Biſhops in whom Churches were to be United, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more than Pariſh Miniſters, and that the <hi>one Communion</hi> of that time, was more than that every Chriſtian muſt be the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of one Church, where Chriſt's Ordinances are diſpenſed by a Biſhop, that is, a Miniſter of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>§. 62. Tho' I am not concerned to queſtion the Practice of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops <hi>ſending their Communicatory Letters, to ſignifie that they were promoted.</hi> Yet I ſee no ſufficient Proof of it from the two or three Inſtances that he bringeth. It muſt be either a Law, or a great Train of Inſtances, in many ſeveral Nations, in greater and leſſer Churches, and under diverſe Circumſtances and Caſes of theſe Churches` that will bear the weight of ſo univerſal a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. But I paſs this: for it doth not much concern our main Queſtion. He will find it alſo hard to prove, that theſe Letters were ſent to all other Biſhops, (as he affirmeth, <hi>p.</hi> 80.) that had been a Work of no ſmall Labour: I ſuppoſe they did thus correſpond with ſome next adjacent Biſhops, or who were of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial note; which we alſo do, as I ſhewed before. That there were <hi>Metropolitans</hi> in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, he aſſerteth; and I deny it not. But they were but Moderators of the greater Meetings, (as the Biſhops were of leſſer ones,) of the Parochial Miniſters and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: as alſo were the <hi>Primats,</hi> and in <hi>Affrick</hi> eſpecially, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150243:50"/>
Biſhop or Miniſter, had this Dignity: but it was Praeceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Dignity, wherein they were above their Brethren, not Power and Authority, but this our Author toucheth but tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently; and ſo I ſhall not inſiſt on it: only I ask him; how do <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> in our modern ſenſe, agree with his Opinion that every Biſhop was <hi>ſupreme,</hi> and <hi>had no Eccleſiastical Superior on Earth: See §. 9. p.</hi> 82. where he is Diſcourſing of purging out a Heretical Biſhop; his thoughts ſeem to run ſomewhat mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. He ſaith <hi>the Colledge of Biſhops might do</hi> (to him) <hi>the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent of a formal Depoſition; they could refuſe him their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and thereby exclude him from their Epiſcopal Colledge: and they could oblige all the Christians within his District to abandon him.</hi> And becauſe he ſaw that his former Aſſertion of the ſupreme Power of a Biſhop, and his having no Eccleſiaſtical Superior, would be objected; he ſaith no Biſhop was ſuperior to another in point of Power and Juriſdiction. How to make all this hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, is not eaſie to know. 1. To wreath the yoke of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Domination on the Church, he eſtabliſheth <hi>Independency</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Biſhops: whereas no Reaſon can be given, why Pariſhes ſhould not be <hi>Independent</hi> on one another, as well as Provinces. I look on both theſe ſorts of <hi>Independency,</hi> as contrary to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Church; and on <hi>Subordination,</hi> as of Natural and Divine Right. 2. If the Colledge of Biſhops had not formal Power to depoſe a Heretical Biſhop: by what Authority could they oblige the Chriſtians to abandon him, and to chooſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: if he ſay, the Fundamental Law of ſound Faith and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or as he ſpeaketh, of <hi>one Faith, and one Communion,</hi> obliged the Chriſtians to this. <hi>A.</hi> That is antecedent to the interpoſing of the Authority of the Epiſcopal Colledge, and they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to it, tho' there were no ſuch Colledge. 3. That no Biſhop hath Power over another Biſhop, is no more than we ſay of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. But it is ſtrange that the Community of Biſhops, hath not formal and direct Power over every one of their own num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; both with reſpect to his Communion with them; and with
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:150243:50"/>
reſpect to his particular Charge; that maketh a wider door both for Hereſie and Schiſm, and for Peoples Beeing, without remedy, under the Plague of bad Miniſters, than any thing that Parity can be charged with. 4. The People are here left Judges of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Haereſie, and other Incapacitating ill Qualities; and ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether they will leave him or not: the Colledge of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops can do no more but inform them, and tell them what they are obliged by the Laws of <hi>one Faith, and one Communion</hi> to do. 5. What if the Biſhop will not leave his Charge, nor the People abandon him, hath Chriſt left no Ordinance in his Church, as a Remedy of this Caſe? The Colledge of Biſhops cannot excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat him, nor them: that were to exerciſe formal Authority over him or them: if they then, will not yield to the Colledges Information or Advice, they may go on in their way without further Controlement. Thus we ſee that men will venture to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine the Soundneſs, Peace, and Purity of the Church, that they may eſtabliſh a Lordly Prelacy over the People of God. What he inſiſteth ſo much on, <hi>p.</hi> 86, 87. about directing publick Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Biſhops, and their being ſigned by them: is not worth our notice. We alſo count it regular for our Moderators to be ſo treated: but there was ſome peculiar Reaſon, why it was ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually obſerved in that Age, becauſe the <hi>Praeſes</hi> of their Meeting was fixed, and it was Interpretatively a Degrading of him, or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning his Title, to do otherwiſe: but this importeth no ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Juriſdiction. He telleth, <hi>p.</hi> 87. that <hi>every Haeretical, or Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Biſhop, and all who adhered to him, were</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>out of the Church.</hi> This I do not believe, for how ſhall a man be known to be Haeretical, till he were tryed and judged? His Proofs amount to no more, but that ſuch were dealt with as out of the Church; and may be the manner of Proceſs againſt them, is not mentioned: but ſuch a negative Argument, will not prove that no more was done to caſt them out: if that be the Epiſcopal courſe of Cenſure, wee intend not to follow it: and if that were the way in the <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anick</hi> Age, it maketh its Example leſs Venerable and Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:150243:51"/>
but it ſaith nothing for the Biſhop's <hi>ſole Power:</hi> he ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 89. that <hi>a Biſhop never called a Presbyter his Collegue. A.</hi> If it be underſtood of Presbyters without a Charge, there is Reaſon for it: he had no joynt Charge of the Congregation, we uſe the ſame way of Appellation. But if it be meant of a Moderator, with reſpect to the other Brethren; I anſwer we find Presbyters calling the Biſhop <hi>Brother;</hi> as was noted before: Yea, <hi>Concil. Carthag. 4. Canon.</hi> 35. it is Decreed, that <hi>tho' a Biſhop in conſeſſu Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terorum ſublimior ſedeat, intra domum Collegam ſe Presbyterorum cognoſcat.</hi> This, its true, was a litle after <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time: but it was when Church-Domination was rather growing than decreaſing.</p>
            <p>§. 63. His ſtrength is now far ſpent, when in the end of his Book, he waſteth ſo many words to ſet off an Argument, which is fitter to be ſmiled at, than laboriouſly anſwered. It is that <hi>the Chriſtian Biſhops in</hi> Cypria'<hi>s time, made ſuch a Figure in the Church, that they were the Chief Butt of the Malice of Perſecutors: others might live in Peace at Home, when they were forced to Flee.</hi> And he is at pains to prove this, which I think was never queſtioned in any Age of the Church. Their Station made them conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, (for I deny not they were above Presbyters in Dignity,) their Parts (ſome of them) made them to be jealouſed: their Zeal for God, made them hateful to the Promoters of Satan's Kingdom. But all this can never prove that they had the <hi>ſole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of the Church; nor that they had Juriſdiction over Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, who were fixed in the Church, to overſee any part of it. Many Presbyters, Deacons, yea private Chriſtians, who were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent for Ability to confound the Adverſary: for Zeal and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; or for their Station in the World, were perſecuted as well as their Biſhops. That this is neither ſtrange, nor concludent of Epiſcopal Power, is evident (not to fetch an Inſtance from far,) in the late Epiſcopal Perſecution among our ſelves: the Miniſters were mainly Hunted, Intercommuned, Impriſoned, forced to Hide or Flee: and the more eminent or zealous they were, the harder it went with them: yea, ſome who were freer than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:150243:51"/>
others, of what was thought Sedition, Diſorder, or Rebellion, yet were hardly uſed, for the Hurt that it was thought they might do to that which was the great <hi>Diana</hi> of the Aſcendent Party. And yet all this will not prove that they had, or pretended to, or were thought to have Juriſdiction over their Brethren. I do therefore deny the Conſequence, the Biſhops (ſome of them for I will not ſay it was the Lot of them all) were mainly perſecuted; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they and not the Presbyters had the Authority in Governing the Church. If <hi>Decius</hi> had ſuch <hi>a dread of a Biſhop being ſetled in</hi> Rome, <hi>that he would more patiently have endured a Prince to rivall it with him for the Empire:</hi> I am ſure he had not ſo much Cauſe as his Succeſſors had; from the Succeſſors of that Biſhop: Of no more Force is his Argument drawn from <hi>Galienus directing his Edict to the Biſhops, when he ſtopt the Perſecution:</hi> For we deny not that they had an eminent Station in the Church, and had a chief Hand in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of her Affairs, whether ye conſider them as Pariſh-Paſtors, as they all were; or Moderators in greater Church-meetings, as ſome of them were. I have (as he willeth his Reader to do) <hi>conſidered and weighed his Arguments without partiality, and in the Ballance of Juſtice:</hi> But am not yet convinced, that the Schiſme that is in the Church is chargeable on us; but on his Party. Let the Reader judge whether of us have beſt grounds for our Opinion.</p>
            <p>§. 64. He concludeth with making excuſe, from the bulk of his Book, that he doth not (as he firſt intended) <hi>prove Epiſcopal Praeemenencie to be of divine Right, as being Chriſt's Ordinance, and handed down to us from the Apoſtles in the conſtant Practice of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church.</hi> This is the conſtant Cant of that Party; but I have met with none who was able to evince this tho' the learnedeſt among them; and not a few of them, have eſſayed it. If this Author ſhall think fit to make another Effort, as he declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf ready to do, if commanded by him to whom he writs this long Epiſtle) and if he bring any thing new; and not fully anſwered already: I doubt not but his Arguments will be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to better purpoſe, than what is, or can be done, by ſuch a mean hand as mine is.</p>

            <p>AFter the former Sheets were almoſt Printed, I met with two Books at the ſame time, which I had not before ſeen: the one called <hi>the Fundamental Charter of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytry,</hi> &amp;c. with a Preface of 167 Pages, by a nameleſs Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: the other <hi>an Inquiry into the new Opinions (chiefly) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by the Presbyterians in</hi> Scotland; <hi>with ſome Animadverſions on the Defence of the Vindications of the Kirk: by</hi> A. M. <hi>D. D.</hi> This latter Book ſeemeth to have more of Argument than ſome others which I have ſeen from ſome <hi>Scots</hi> Epiſcopalians, if not from the ſame Hand: I have much deſired that our Debates might run in that more pure Channel; and rejoice to ſee any hopes of it. I am ſorry that now I have no time from neceſſary, urgent, and daily work, to conſider this Book ſo as to Anſwer it, if I ſhall not be Proſelyted by it. I intend to try it's ſtrength as ſoon as I ſhall have leaſure, if the LORD give Life and Health; and if it ſhall not be ſooner Anſwered by ſome other Hand; which I do much wiſh.</p>
            <p>§. 2. The former of theſe two Books is expreſly levelled againſt an Act of the Parliament of this Nation; and is a direct Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: and therefore the Examination of it is out of my Road; and is moſt fit for ſuch as are converſant in the Affairs of State, and know the Politick which moved the Parliament ſo to contrive their Act. I do judge that he who ſhall undertake it will find no hard task. Beſide, the Presbyterian Miniſters did never look on <hi>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the People</hi> (which that Act mentioneth in it's narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive) as <hi>the fundamental Charter of Presbytry;</hi> however the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament might wiſely conſider it in their Conſultation and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, and mention it rather than what did more ſway ſome of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:150243:53"/>
them. We always did, and do, found the Government of the Church by Parity, on Divine Inſtitution; and look on Prelacy as contrary to Chriſt's appointment.</p>
            <p>§. 3. What I now undertake is, a tranſient view (ſuch as the Preſs haſtening to an end of the former Diſcourſe, will allow) of his Preface: which I hope may be lookt on as a due Refutation of it: nor can I imagine that any judicious and unbyaſſed man will judge, that ſuch a parcel of Stuff, deſerveth a laborious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he hath need of a hardened Noſe who can inſiſt long in an exact Anatomatical Scrutiny into ſuch a rotten Carion. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath out-done his Brethren (yea, and himſelf too) in Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſgate-Rhetorick: he ſeemeth to be eminently gifted that way; to the ſilencing of who ever will oppoſe him; as ſome learned acute men have quickly had their Mouths ſtopt when the Tongues of ſome of theſe good Women have been let looſe againſt them. I had rather own in my ſelf all the dulneſs that he is pleaſed to impute to the man whom he deſigneth to expoſe, than enter the Liſts with him at that Weapon: and I do freely confeſs I am not qualified for it; and if I were, I ſhould think it unſutable to my Character (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mean) and inconſiſtent with a good Conſcience. Such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of Mind, and ſuch injurious Defamation, is not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Chriſtianity; nor is ſutable to that Learning that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in them who write Polemick Divinity: for, <hi>Scolding is no Scholarſhip.</hi> If his Adverſary was weak, he ſhould have knockt him down with ſtrong Arguments; not beſpattered him with dirty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileings: the one would have ruined his Cauſe, the other but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawb'd his Perſon; and it may be eaſily wiped off. If the Cauſe which my Adverſary owneth, need this Conduct, it is weak, and not worth contending for: if not; they who do ſo manage it are no credit to it.</p>
            <p>§. 4. I refer the Reader who would have a view of this Author's Qualities more truly than he Characterizeth other men, to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of</hi> Sarum'<hi>s Vindication:</hi> where, if he be not aimed at, he is very plainly chaſtiſed in Effigie: for <hi>G. B.</hi> &amp; <hi>G. R.</hi> ſeem to have
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:150243:53"/>
been ſtung with the ſame kind of Serpent; if not the ſame indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual. He had dealt more wiſely, if he had not convinced the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by this management, of the very ſame ill Qualities in himſelf, that he ſo frankly attributeth to another. I am ſure he hath ſhewed litle Wiſdom in bringing Inſtances to prove his confident Aſſertions: had he contented himſelf with bold Saying, and quibling Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of what he thinketh fit to load one with; ſome who know neither him, nor the perſon who is the Butt of his Malice, might have believed ſome part of what he alledgeth (they who know that perſon, however they cannot but ſee many Infirmities in him, have other thoughts of him; and indeed better than ever he could deſerve: and they who know this Author will judge that <hi>his Tongue, nor Pen, is no Slander.</hi>) But now his Proofs are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly unſuted to what they are brought for, that a litle atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may ſerve to improve them as Weapons againſt himſelf, and as Evidences of theſe things in himſelf which he deſigneth by them to faſten on another. I perceive he hath been at pains to read all that hath been written by <hi>G. R.</hi> on ſeveral occaſions; and what he thinketh fit to aſcribe to him; to ſee what he could pick up in theſe Papers wherewith he might reproach the Author: in which alſo he hath (innocently and without deſign) done him a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for if ſo critical an Eye could find no more to try his Skill upon in all theſe Writings, it is like there are many things in them which he could not Blame: for, <hi>exceptio firmat Regulam in non exceptis.</hi> It is a wonder if ſuch a perſon as he expoſeth could ſay ſo much to any purpoſe.</p>
            <p>§. 4. I ſhall not inſiſt on his civility to the Parliament, and their Act; nor his modeſt Reflexion on himſelf; nor his great care ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt to ſute his Diſcourſe to the <hi>Engliſh-Nation,</hi> even in the Words and Phraſes: nor on the account he giveth of the helps he uſed. Only I take notice how much pains he is at to prove (through 14 Pages) that the Book commonly called <hi>Knox's Hiſtory</hi> was not written by <hi>John Knox:</hi> I know none, who is much converſant in our <hi>Scots</hi> Affairs, who is contrary to him in this: and if <hi>G. R.</hi> was
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:150243:54"/>
ſo abſurd as to cite that Book under the Name by which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called; if it hence follow that he thought <hi>John Knox</hi> was the Author, let him paſs for as ignorant as our Author will have him to be: if this be no good conſequence, I hope it is no great evidence of this Author's Learning ſo to infer. That <hi>John Knox</hi> did not compoſe that Book, (tho' much of the Materials of it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his Manuſcripts) hath been held by Presbyterian Brethren, before this Author went to School: neither do I know any of them who <hi>are earnest to have it believed that he wrote it:</hi> yea, this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf citeth it always under the Name of <hi>John Knox;</hi> as he confeſſeth: and why might not another do ſo too, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating about the true Author of it; which had been a needleſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion from his Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>§. 6. After he has diſgorged a great deal of Gall againſt <hi>G. R.</hi> and declined him for an Antagoniſt (who hath the ſame averſion from entering the Liſts with him, unleſs he deal more like a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and a Diſputant) we might (but it is in vain) expect he ſhould be more compoſed: his Bile overfloweth through all his Sheets. He mentioneth ſome Paſſages in my Writings that he will not inſiſt on; only noteth them with a <hi>Nigrum Theta,</hi> as proofs of my unqueſtionable ignorance: they are, that I hold <hi>Ruling-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who are no Preachers, to be of Divine Inſtitution;</hi> that <hi>the Fathers, and Scripture alſo, owne them under the Name of Biſhops.</hi> That <hi>Patronages came not in till the ſeventh or eight Century, or later:</hi> (where his own ignorance, or ſomewhat elſe, appeareth; the word is, they <hi>were not ſetled</hi> till then: it is well-known, that many Uſages crept into the Church long before they were ſetled, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Law, or univerſal Practice.) That, <hi>moſt, and the moſt eminent of the Prelatists acknowledge, that by Chriſt's appointment, and according to the Practices of the firſt Ages of the Church, ſhe ought to be, and was govern'd in common by Ministers acting in Parity,</hi> (which is a groſs Miſrepreſentation; for that is ſaid of Chriſt's <hi>equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intruſting</hi> all his Miniſters with Power of Preaching and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: which is aſſerted and fully proved by the learned <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:150243:54"/>
in his <hi>Irenicum:</hi> and what followeth is that Author's own Words, not attributed to Chriſts appointment as unalterable, nor to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church. Yet I ſhall not decline debating of both theſe with him (tho' I ſay not they are the Opinion of Prelatiſts) That <hi>Dioceſan Epiſcopacy was not ſetled in</hi> Cyprian'<hi>s time,</hi> &amp;c. (What Ignorance is in this, is to be judged by the foregoing Book, That the <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Epistles of</hi> Anacletus <hi>are genuine,</hi> is neither aſſerted nor ſuppoſed, nor is any opinion given about them: only they are uſed as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Writing; and <hi>argumentum ad hominem.</hi> If this one Witneſs be caſt, we have enough beſide. That it is aſſerted, <hi>Rational Def. of Nonconf. p.</hi> 10. that <hi>Epiſcopacy is not in any Protestant Church but in</hi> England: is neither truly, nor with Candor ſaid; the Expreſſion is, <hi>as in</hi> England: and it is eaſily demonſtrable, that in no Proteſtant Church, it is in that height, or doth ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſwallow up the Ruling Power of Presbyters, as it doth in <hi>England:</hi> If my Expoſition of <hi>Jerom</hi>'s <hi>toto orbe decretum est,</hi> be Ignorant, or Erroneous; I muſt ſo abide, till this Profound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Enlighten mine Eyes; which he hath not vouchſafed to do. Another of <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Sayings, <hi>Quid facit Epiſcopus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>excepta Ordinatione:</hi> he ſaith my <hi>Gloſs on it, hath been ſufficiently expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Hist. of the General Aſſembly</hi> 1690: and I ſay, it hath been ſufficiently Vindicated, in Anſwer to that, and other four Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets; and <hi>Def. of Vindic.</hi> in Anſwer to the <hi>Apology, p.</hi> 24, 25. I ſhall now add, that very Expoſition of that Paſſage, was given by <hi>Marſilius Patavinus,</hi> cited in the end of the Preface to <hi>Paul Bayn</hi>'s <hi>Dioceſan's Tryal:</hi> that Author lived about <hi>Anno</hi> 1324. In his Book called <hi>Defenſor Pacis,</hi> againſt the <hi>Pope;</hi> he hath theſe Words, (ſpeaking of that Paſſage of <hi>Jerome,) Ordinatio non ſignificat ibi Poteſtatem conferendi, ſeu Collationem Sacrorum Ordinum; ſed OEconomicam Potestatem Regulandi, vel Dirigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Eccleſiae Ritus atque Perſonas, quantum ad Exercitium Divini Cultus in Templo: unde ab Antiquis Legum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> latoribus, vocantur OE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomici Reverendi.</hi> This we maintain to be competent to every Pariſh Miniſter; tho' not to the Elders of the Congregation, to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:150243:55"/>
manage theſe in the Publick Aſſembly. I hope no man of ſenſe, will reckon that Author an ignorant Perſon, of whom <hi>Papir. Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> ſaith, <hi>cujus Libri extant, non cuidem Verborum, ſed Rerum aepparatu, prorſus Admirandi.</hi> His Inſtance of my Ignorance, in Citing ſome Greek Authors, out of the Latine Tranſlations of them, is ſo ridiculous, as it needeth no Anſwer.</p>
            <p>§. 7. He next cometh to ſome Inſtances, that he ſeemeth to lay more Weight on. The firſt amounteth to no more but this, that I Cited <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> out of <hi>Bellarm.</hi> and I had not <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> then by me, (as our Author ſaith, he had not <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> when he wrote this Preface,) and anſwered <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Words, as he brought them: if he doubt, (as he ſeemeth to do,) whether I did faithfully Tranſcribe <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Words, let him conſult the Place: And now, when I have ſeen and conſidered <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi>'s own Words, I am ſure that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is not the ſame way aſcribed to the Biſhop alone, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are to him, with the Presbyters: for he deriveth theſe from Chriſt's Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he doth not pretend concerning that: nor indeed could he, ſeing he had ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: he muſt then mean, that in his time, the Biſhop had an Election, and may be, alſo Ordination to a ſuperior Degree of Dignity, (which was without a ſuperior Power,) or that to him, was committed the Performance of the Ceremonie in Clerical Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>viz.</hi> Laying on of Hands: tho' I am ſure, and have ſhewed, this was not the conſtant Practice. What our Author blameth in my ſenſe of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is fully Vindicated, <hi>Gilleſp. Eng. Pop. Cer. P. 3. C. 8. Diggreſſ. 1. P.</hi> 164. His next Inſtance, is out of <hi>Ration. Def.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 199. where I prove the Peoples Power in Electing their Paſtors, from <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. and that from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (not barely from the force of the word, as he, by Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, or Ignorance, miſtaketh; but) by the force of the word, and it's Circumſtances in that Place. If <hi>Scapula</hi> be not a good Voucher for the Signification of a Greek Word, both in Profane, and Eccleſiaſtical Writings, his Lexicon is little worth: if he be,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:150243:55"/>
our Author has litle Judgment in declining his Authority; ſeing not one of the Inſtances he giveth of the word, is for Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but generally, for giving Suffrage. If we Conſult Scripture, it is uſed <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 41. and 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 8. 19. in both which Places, it is uſed for Election. And its importing alſo Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I alledged, he is pleaſed to mock at: but thinketh not fit to take notice of the Grounds brought for that Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the beſt Criticks: which I impute to his Unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs with that ſort of Learning; if we may be ſo bold, as to Queſtion the Skill of one, who ſo looketh down on other poor Mortals, as <hi>Ignoramus's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 8. The next Proof of Ignorance is, I was bold to reprove one of my Adverſaries for commending Miniſters from their <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Christian Philoſophy:</hi> Hence our Auther ſpendeth about 10 Pages to prove, that that Phraſe was uſed by the Fathers: all which is eaſily granted, and was never queſtioned by any that I know. Only I ſtill think (and if that be to be ignorant, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhun that blame) that however the Fathers did pertinently uſe it, and even at this time it may to very good purpoſe be uſed in ſome caſes, yet that in a time when Socinianiſm aboundeth, and when revealed Religion is ſo much decryed, by not a few, and all Religion is by ſome reſolved into Nature, and Humane Reaſon, the improvement of which is Philoſophy: I ſay in that caſe, it is not ſo very proper a Commendation of a Miniſter, that is taken from Chriſtian Philoſophy, as that which is taken from that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Divine Things, which is built on Revelation, as ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to what we have by Nature, and is attained by Ratiocinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from ſcientifick Principles.</p>
            <p>§. 9. He next thinketh fit to charge his Antagoniſt with Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, the Inſtances are firſt, (<hi>Animadverſ.</hi> on <hi>Stillingf. Jrenic. p.</hi> 30.) I had ſaid that all Ceremonies of God's Worſhip, are Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip themſelves. He ſhould have minded that it is there ſaid that the learned <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> ſaith the ſame, <hi>Irenic. p.</hi> 65. which I ſtill aver: and if he will not aſcribe Non-ſenſe to that unqueſtionably
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:150243:56"/>
learned Author, why may not ſuch an one as I take ſhelter under his ſhadow. But if this Author had underſtood the Diſtinction, that I (and many more learned than I) have elſewhere cleared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Circumſtances, Rites and Ceremonies, and that this laſt Sort, is peculiar to Religious Actions, and hath place in no other kinds of Actions, he might have underſtood, that ſuch Actions are Religious, and Acts of Worſhip, and that they are true Worſhip, if inſtituted by Chriſt, and falſe, if diviſed by men. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be judged Nonſenſe, by any who hath, with Judgement, lookt into the Controverſie about Ceremonies; but it muſt be Nonſenſe to judge ſo of it. The Fetch, (as he calleth it) of Ceremonies that are in the place of <hi>Competentes,</hi> or <hi>Catechumeni;</hi> called in the ſame place <hi>Candidate Ceremonies,</hi> is no more Nonſenſe than other Metaphors are, if the Author be ſo ignorant, as to underſtand that Phraſe literaly, it is his own Nonſenſe, and none of mine. The next peice of Nonſenſe is, that <hi>the Affirmative of the ſecond Commandment is, that we ſhould worſhip God in the way that he has preſcribed in his word: Rational Def.</hi> p. 125. If this be Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, I have for my Compurgators, the whole <hi>Aſſembly of Divines</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who in the Shorter Catechiſm, gave this Anſwer to the Queſtion, <hi>What is required in the ſecond Commandment?</hi> The ſecond <hi>Commandment requireth, the Receiving, Obſerving, keeping pure and entire, all ſuch Religious Worſhip, and Ordinances as God hath appointed in his Word.</hi> It is like this Author will not ſtick to charge that venerable Aſſembly with Error, but if he dare charge them with Nonſenſe, it is no great matter if poor I take a ſhare with them. I am ſo dull as to underſtand as litle what Nonſenſe is in <hi>owning the Lutherian Churches, as Sister Churches, and ſo having Communion with them, and yet refuſing to joyn with them on their Instituted Ceremonies.</hi> If any thing here look like Nonſenſe, it is from a Typographical Error, (which I confeſe that Book aboundeth with, the Correcting of the Preſs being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that Author to a negligent perſon, while himſelf was at the diſtance of ſome hundrdes of Miles) it is in the Manuſcript <hi>unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted 
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:150243:56"/>
Worſhip:</hi> and is meant of parts of Worſhip not appointed by Chriſt, but deviſed by men: We can have Communion with them in owning the ſame Truths, (ſeing they own the ſame Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truths with us) and in theſe parts of Worſhip that Chriſt hath appointed; but we cannot joyn with them in worſhiping God, by their Devices, and if they intermix theſe with inſtituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, we muſt forbear Communion with them in both, rather than pollute our ſelves with uncommanded Worſhip: If this be Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, I muſt bear that Imputation. Another Inſtance of Nonſenſe is, <hi>Second Vindication,</hi> p. 14. <hi>That the two Governments (Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery and Monarchie) of Church and State, have ſuited one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many Ages, ſince the Nation was Proteſtant:</hi> The Authors Antagoniſt had expreſſed his Wonder, <hi>how Presbytery could ſuit Monarchie in the State.</hi> I confeſs I was not ſo critical, as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to him, that he meant Presbytery in the State, and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy in the State; (For I cannot diſcover Non-ſenſe where it is not, even in an Adverſary, as this ſenſible Man can;) And I plainly anſwered, <hi>that theſe two Governments; (viz.</hi> Presbytery in the Church, and Monarchy in the State) <hi>did ſuit one another.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Non-ſenſe is in my Expreſſion, or in my Adverſaries ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, let the Reader judge: Alſo whether a Handle is here given for a Cavil; or Malice, or Ignorance, hath ſupplyed it.</p>
            <p>§. 10. Another thing wherein he hath a mind to find Non-ſenſe, is <hi>Animadverſ. on</hi> Stillingfleets <hi>Irenicum,</hi> p. 5. where the learned Dr. having aſſerted, that <hi>where there are different Opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and probable Arguments on both ſides; if it be not a matter neceſſary to Salvation, it giveth ground to think that that matter in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy was never intended for a neceſſary mean for Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in the Church:</hi> On this occaſion, <hi>G. R.</hi> was bold to ſay, that <hi>if things not neceſſary to Salvation, must needs be</hi> thus <hi>clearly revealed, much more this clearneſs is needful in things neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> The Non-ſenſe of this I cannot yet perceive: and I think this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor (not by his piercing Judgement, but by this tinctured Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) was the firſt that diſcovered it. And I cannot ſhun ſtill to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:150243:57"/>
think, that the Fundamental Truths ſhould be, and are revealed with more evidence, than the inferior Truths; and that the Lord would not have us to venture our Salvation, on that obſcurity of Revelation, that we may not venture the Peace of the Church on; if that were at Stake. But the beſt is, that the peace of the Church dependeth not ſo much on Oneneſs of Opinion, about ſome inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Truths, as in honeſt endeavours after that, and in mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance where it cannot be attained. I am litle concerned in his not believing a Typographical Error, in a paſſage about the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God; which a Friend of his, (if not himſelf) had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and I had ſolemnly diſowned, and do ſtill diſowne, as what I never thought, ſpoke, nor wrote: It ſeems he meaſureth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of others by his own. But he will prove what he affirmeth; <hi>That Book was Re-printed in</hi> England, <hi>without Alteration, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; Ergo</hi> it was the Authors, not the Printers Error. A wiſe Conſequence indeed: if it went abroad with that Error, (as I deny not it did) it is no wonder it was Re-printed with it: but that it was ever Re-printed, is more than I know, or ever heard before: if he will not believe me in this, I hope ſome others will. He next ſetteth the black Mark of Non-ſenſe, on the Arguments I bring againſt <hi>a ſtinted Liturgy of mans Compoſure: Rational Def.</hi> p. 226. I can ſee nothing but tollerable Senſe, and ſome ſtrength of Reaſon, in theſe Arguments; when I review them after many years: And our Author thought not fit to diſcover it to us, and therefore they muſt even ſtand as they were. Only this great Judge of Non-ſenſe, ſheweth us that <hi>the Lords Prayer is a ſet Form and diſowned by Presbyterians, and therefore that must be here</hi> included: Anſwer, that Prayer (if a ſet Form; that is, if it be enjoined to be rehearſed in publick Worſhip) is not a ſet Form of mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing, and therefore falleth not under the Arguments that he oppoſeth. Neither do Presbyterians diſown that Prayer, but uſe it as a Directory for Prayer, and if any will repeat the words in ſolemn Worſhip, they do not cenſure them. He hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, (tho' ſo confuſedly, that I cannot make Senſe of his Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:150243:57"/>
of Non-ſenſe) that <hi>we are</hi> Quakers, <hi>becauſe againſt Liturgies.</hi> We find no Liturgies in the Apoſtolick Church; and yet they were no <hi>Quakers:</hi> if all praying without Book were <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> (as he ignorantly inſinuateth) many Epiſcopal men muſt be ſuch, for they do not always uſe the Book. His retorting the Argument on <hi>extemporary Prayer,</hi> is ſtrangely wide, and hath been often anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: But this Author's buſineſs is not to clear Truth, but to run down a certain perſon whom he hath in chaſe: <hi>Extemporary Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> impoſeth neither Matter, nor Frame, or Compoſure, on the Hearers, and Joyner, further than Nature it ſelf maketh neceſſary, where people pray together: but ſet Forms do.</p>
            <p>§. 11. Yet more Non-ſenſe: his Antagoniſt <hi>ſpeaketh of the Popiſh Church</hi> of Scotland, <hi>and of the</hi> Proteſtant Church, <hi>alſo often of the Epiſcopal and Presbyterian Church there, whereas the Church is but one:</hi> Which this Author is at much pains to expoſe: but by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hape, expoſeth himſelf in ſo doing: I liſt not to contend about words, whether you call a divided Church (as <hi>Scotland</hi> was while partly popiſh, and partly Proteſtant: and novv is vvhole partly Presbyterian and partly Epiſcopal) two Churches, or one Church rent in two peices; I think is not material, I ſee no Non-ſenſe in either way of ſpeaking: Both Parties or Churches if permitted muſt have their Government, and Governours, neither is it fit that they ſhould rule that Church, or part of the Church to which they are oppoſite, and which they would deſtroy. It is wholly beſide this purpoſe that he bringeth in, of my blaming <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet</hi> for making <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>conſiſt, in two Convocations</hi> (which our Author doth ſo groſly miſtake for the Upper and Lower Houſes of one Convocation, whereas that Author doth make two Convocations in two diſtinct Provinces, p. 300) for that is one Church united in it's parts, not divided into Parties as the Church we ſpeak of. And it's leſs intelligible, how that ſhould <hi>have two Heads,</hi> than in this caſe: Why two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may not be called <hi>two governing Bodies,</hi> in a divided Church, I cannot yet underſtand, for all his Story of the Platonick Monſter:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:150243:58"/>
That <hi>no Head is mentioned,</hi> why ſhould he wonder; unleſs he think a viſible Head of the Church in a ſingle perſon is neceſſary; in ſuch Metaphorick Speeches, there is no matter of moment; whether ye call the governing Part of a Church a Body, or a Head: but enough of this quibling on this Head.</p>
            <p>§. 12. Our Author's next Eſſay, is to ſet forth his Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt's <hi>ill Nature:</hi> in which Diſcourſe, every one may ſee, how manifeſtly and fully he ſetteth forth that Temper of Mind in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which he blameth in another: moſt of the Paſſages he inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on, were written againſt ſome Pamphlets, which contain the moſt falſe and injurious Imputations, and that not againſt a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only, but againſt all the Presbyterians without Diſcrimination: yea, againſt the whole Nation, in it's Repreſentative, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and many of theſe Aſſertions are proved to be falſe, and if a certain Author, by a Book which gave leſs occaſion, was by every Line, provoked to <hi>the Indecency of Paſſion,</hi> what wonder, if juſt Indignation was warmly expreſſed againſt ſuch Abuſive Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If I have called any thing <hi>Lies, Railing, Saucineſs, Impudence,</hi> which was not ſo, I am content to underly the juſt Sentence of unbyaſſed men, but this Author and his Complices, take a Bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Liberty to Reproach, and if they be told of it, they are Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous beyond Meaſure. It is not inconſiſtent with all that Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that is due to men, to give things their true Names, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the Rank and Behaviour of the Perſons we deal with, plead no extraordinary Reſpect. He miſtaketh, when he ſaith, that <hi>I knew, that the Author of the Memorial was dead, before I anſwered his Book:</hi> I do not to this day, know who was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it. What was ſaid about giving up King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt to <hi>England,</hi> ſhould have been refuted by Reaſon, not by Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: I have no Anſwer for ſuch Arguments: neither have I time to examine how fairly all the words are cited, which he addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, nor to ſhew on what occaſion, or on what neceſſity they were written: what he repreſenteth as ſpoken of the Prelatiſts, is injuriouſly blamed, it was ſpoken of a Party of them, (who are
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:150243:58"/>
but few,) who reproached the Presbyterians in general, and in the moſt univerſal Terms; which never was my way againſt them.</p>
            <p>§. 13. If any thing hath dropt from my Pen, which may be judged Uncivil, or ſhort of due Reſpect toward the Learned, and Reverend Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> I am ready to crave him pardon, for I deſigned the contrary: what this Author chargeth me with that way, is partly falſe, as what he citeth out of the <hi>Preface to Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madv. on Irenic.</hi> for both the Prefaces, (I have ſeen one at ſome Copies, and another at other Copies,) were written by another hand, without the knowledge of the Author: partly they are fouly miſrepreſented; to give an Inſtance: this Author faith, that I ſaid of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> p. 18. that <hi>for the moſt part he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but</hi> magno conatu nihil agere. This is miſrepreſented: I ſaid that he inſiſteth moſt on things not controverted, and thence inferred the blame mentioned. It is one thing to charge one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly with an Opinion or Practice: and another, to make an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from it: ſeing many do or ſay that, the ill Conſequence of which they do not obſerve, but will diſowne. His other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are but a juſt Cenſure one ſome Paſſages of that Learned Author's Writings, which I was examining, which cannot be ſhunned in Polemick Writings: to call that a <hi>Contradiction</hi> that I make appear to be ſuch, is no Injury nor Breach of that Civility, that is due to a Stated Adverſary: many things are fair enough in open War, which were not ſo in a State of Peace. This Author is yet more injurious, in expounding all that I have ſaid of a few men of imbittered Spirits; among the Prelatiſts, who have in their Writings reproacht the Presbyterians, and imputed to them, things that they are innocent of, or abhor, applying all this, (I ſay) to all them who are of the Epiſcopal Perſwaſion; or to the Party in general, as that they are <hi>Eſaus, Serpents, Spiteful, &amp;c.</hi> I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge him to prove what he ſaith: I deny it: if I have ſaid any thing of <hi>Immorality among the Clergy,</hi> it is too evident, tho' I know ſome of them are innocent, and lament it. What he citeth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:150243:59"/>
as ſpoken againſt the <hi>Church of</hi> England, <hi>and her Clergy,</hi> is either what is in Controverſie between us, and them: I have been ſo bold, as to call their <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies Superſtition,</hi> and to mention what is the Native Concomitant of Superſtition, that <hi>men will be wiſer than Chriſt or his Apoſtles.</hi> This is no more a Crime, than it is a Fault to be oppoſite to their way. What is ſaid of <hi>Immoralities, and Inſufficiency for the Ministery, and other Corruptions that are among them,</hi> is not chargeable on me, yea nor on Presbyterians alone, but it is the Complaint, of the beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, ſee <hi>the five Groans of the Church, and Mr.</hi> Bold'<hi>s Serm.</hi> Theſe Authors were truly Sons of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> thouſands among them, complain of theſe things, who yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to that Communion. I might well diſowne that Principle of <hi>Sentencing, &amp; Executing Kings by their Subjects,</hi> about which ſome of the Church of <hi>England</hi> had informed forreign Divines, as the Principle and Doctrine of Presbyterians: becauſe the Generality of Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (very few excepted, and theſe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Independents after,) ſhewed their Abhorrence of that Fact committed on King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, ſo they did in <hi>England,</hi> and ſome of them ſuffered Death, for owning his Son. Is it Incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that I thought, at the time of the late Revolution, it <hi>was fit for Parties to put in their Claim, for what they thought the way of GOD,</hi> that it might be judged of by them who had Authority? if the Church of <hi>England</hi> think, we ought not to mutter againſt the Corruptions of their way, nor ſeek a Remedy in an orderly and legal way, they may know that we pretend to no ſuch Civility, as is inconſiſtent with Faithfulneſs to the Truth, and Ordinances of Chriſt. We are for the Purity of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and for her Peace too, ſo as not to meddle with her without our Sphere: but if ſpeaking, or writing for the good way that we owne, do diſquiet her, with reſpect to her Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, we muſt be excuſed. It is a wiſe Aſſertion, <hi>he exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Readers to purge the Church of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I exhorted none to this Attempt, but in their Station, ſuch as many have
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:150243:59"/>
not: his Expreſſion ſoundeth, as if I had ſtirred all up, that ſhould read this Book, to fall on the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and pull her down.</p>
            <p>§. 14. <hi>Impudence</hi> is the next Epithet, that he laboureth to fix on the man of his Wrath. Inſtances are; It is abſcribed to <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> that their Books reproaching the Presbyterians were ſpread in <hi>England,</hi> but hard to be found in <hi>Scotland:</hi> which he imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to <hi>want of Liberty for Printing ſuch Pieces in</hi> Scotland, <hi>and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard in importing them:</hi> but it is ſufficiently known, that many Books of that ſtrain have been imported, and none ſeized (that I hear of) but one Parcel, which was of another ſtrain. Next it is <hi>Impudence</hi> to aſſert the <hi>Loyalty of Presbyterians. Anſw.</hi> It is more <hi>Impudence</hi> to aſcribe to Presbyterians, what was the Practices of ſome few, with which the far greateſt part, neither did, nor would concur. What was ſaid on this Head, was alſo proved; and it is <hi>Impudence</hi> to put ſuch a Mark on any Aſſertion, and yet not attempt to anſwer the Arguments brought for it. Another <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> is to ſpeak of the <hi>Harmleſneſs of Presbyterians, and that they are no Perſecutors.</hi> And <hi>that any one of many of them ſuffered more Hardſhips, and Barbarous Cruelty, than all the Eſpiſcopalians have endured:</hi> the <hi>Impudence</hi> of this, he proveth very learnedly: <hi>how could one man ſuffer the deprivation of five or ſix hundred Livelyhoods.</hi> That there were ſo many Epiſcopal Miniſters turned out, (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe he meaneth) I know not; but it is not a wiſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, of one man to have ſo many Families to maintain on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and each to have his own: I affirm that one man who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>Torture, Intercommunning, was forc'd to lodge in Dens and Woods, and in daily hazard of his Life, who was ſold for a Slave in the remote places of the Earth,</hi> ſuffered more (tho' his loſs of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney did not amount to ſo great a Sum) than all they did. I find nothing in what followeth to diſprove what I had ſaid, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſs to another piece of <hi>Impudence,</hi> (which yet is a repetition of what he had ſaid before) that Presbyterians are no Rebels. To prove this he (very pertinently) alledgeth a Contradiction
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:150243:60"/>
between firſt <hi>Vindic. ad Q.</hi> 2. §. 3. where it is ſaid that <hi>Epiſcopacy raiſed a Tumult,</hi> and §. 5. <hi>they</hi> (the Epiſcopal men) <hi>raiſed no Tumults.</hi> (This laſt is <hi>ad Q.</hi> 3. §. 5.) <hi>Anſw.</hi> The former is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (as plainly appeareth to them who will ſee) of the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and Parliament. The other of ſuch Tumults as our Author chargeth the Rable with, and it is expreſly ſaid that they did what they could to raiſe a War. Here then is that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Contradiction that he findeth, or fancieth: a War managed by potent Armies and for a long time, is in one place called a Tumult; and yet Scuffles among a confuſed Rout, which are ſoon over, are diſtinguiſhed from ſuch a War. Here is neither Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction nor Impudence: The <hi>Impudence</hi> that followeth is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly imputed to me (it is vindicating the Presbyterians from being <hi>Rebels</hi>) for what himſelf ſeemeth to applaud in other more modeſt perſons, he might find frequently ſaid by me. But if it be Impudence to deny Presbyterians to be <hi>Rebels,</hi> what kind of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity muſt he be of who chargeth them with it, while his own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is guilty of Actions of the ſame nature, and were as univerſally engaged in them. What hath lately fallen out, might teach him either to juſtifie what he ſo freely calleth Rebellion, or to lay the blame of it on <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and not <hi>Presbyterians</hi> only: and then if no ſhare of it fall on himſelf, let us know what Party he is of.</p>
            <p>§. 15. He next challengeth ſome Inſinuations, as if the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians in</hi> Scotland <hi>were the only Proteſtants;</hi> which cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from any Words he citeth. Neither can it be inferred that I thought, or ſaid that <hi>the Goſpel was not preached but by the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians.</hi> One word he layeth weight on, that <hi>if the Presbyterians had not uſed the Indulgence given to them and Papists; theſe would have occaſion to miſlead People, without any to oppoſe them.</hi> None who had a mind to underſtand Words as they are plainly meant, would ſo conſtruct this Paſſage; ſuch univerſal Expreſſions moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſuffer a Limitation: alſo in that caſe they had done what in them was, that none ſhould oppoſe Popery: as if a Batallion in an Army flee, they act ſuch a part as tendeth to hinder any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:150243:60"/>
to be made to the Enemy. Beſide all this, tho' there were ſome privat Epiſcopal Miniſters appear'd faithful in this Caſe: it is well known how litle moſt of the Biſhops, and the generality of the Clergy appeared, and how they that did ſpeak any thing that way, were diſcouraged by ſome Biſhops. I wiſh he had better cleared to us, how abſurd it is to ſay, that the true Proteſtants in the Nation were for the late Revolution, than by telling us, that <hi>being againſt it was no Popery:</hi> moſt men think it was too much to favour it, and was a defect in that Zeal that ſhould have, in ſuch a Juncture, been ſhewed againſt it. The <hi>ſecret Inſtructions from Holland</hi> that he giveth as the Cauſe of <hi>Presbyterians complying with the Diſpenſing Power:</hi> I never heard of them, but from that Epiſtler whom he mentioneth: and I could anſwer nothing to it but by denying it: and now when he calleth for an Anſwer to it, I ſay, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Presbyterians did never comply with the Diſpenſing Power, but groaned under it as a Grievance: their uſing the Indulgence could not be ſo conſtructed, as I have elſe-where ſhewed. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> I ſolemnly declare that I know nothing to this day of theſe <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Inſtructions. Thirdly,</hi> What moved ſuch Presbyterians as I was acquainted with to ſcruple uſing the Indulgence at firſt, and to accept it at laſt, was, that ſome Conditions and Limitations, that they could not ſubmit to, were left out in the laſt Edition of it. The <hi>Villany</hi> that he chargeth the Presbyterians with, in <hi>Addreſſing King</hi> James <hi>for his Indulgence, while they were on Intrigues to ſupplant him,</hi> muſt be charged on them who were ſo guilty: I knew of no ſuch Intrigues, nor any ſuch deſign then on foot, tho' now I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that ſuch Deſigns were then hatching: neither can I name one perſon among all that accepted of the Indulgence who knew of ſuch Deſigns.</p>
            <p>§. 16. He next bringeth inſtances of <hi>Impudent Shifts</hi> uſed by <hi>G. R.</hi> when he, or his Cauſe is put to it. The rabbled Miniſters were not deprived of their Poſſeſſions (I mean Stipends) by an Act of Parliament (as he alledgeth,) but thruſt from their Places by the Rabble; and the State judged that they could not relieve them without palpable Inconvenience; and becauſe of the notorie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Scandals of not a few of them which had been ſo outed;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:150243:61"/>
(as appeareth from the then Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Declaration,) on which followed the loſs of their Benefices. What the State did, they can beſt give Reaſons for. I never defended what the Rabble did that way. For what is ſaid of <hi>Parliaments calling King</hi> James's <hi>Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from</hi> England, <hi>his Abdicating the Government:</hi> that is plain to be meant of the Parliament of <hi>England:</hi> for tho' it was written by a <hi>Scots-man,</hi> it was ſaid of <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Affairs:</hi> of Retirement from <hi>England,</hi> not from <hi>Scotland:</hi> wherefore here is no Impudence, (unleſs on his own ſide,) tho' the <hi>Scots</hi> Parliament ſpeak nothing of Abdication. This, and what followeth, is picking a Quarrel without cauſe given. The long Story he hath of the Viſcount of <hi>Dundee</hi>'s Plot, and the Forces that came from the Weſt to defend the Convention, containeth ſuch Matters of Fact, as he contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is confidently affirmed by them who were on the Place, and had occaſion to know theſe things, as well as he; and are fully as credible perſons as he is. Let the Reader judge who deſerveth moſt Credit. I was Witneſs to none of theſe things: but ſhall give my Vouchers, if duely called to it: if he can do the like, let unbyaſſed Men judge of the whole Hiſtory. If I had ſaid <hi>the whole Nation knoweth the whole of this Paſſage to be true,</hi> as he affirmeth that the whole Nation knoweth it to be a Figment; I might have been bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with <hi>Impudence,</hi> on better ground than any thing that he hath brought to prove his Charge againſt me.</p>
            <p>§. 17. What was ſaid againſt Dr. <hi>Strachan</hi>'s Defence, he ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth many Words upon it: on which I obſerve a few things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I expreſly referred that Objection to be Anſwered by ſome ſeen in State-Affairs; it being Political rather than Theological. <hi>2ly</hi> That I pleaded an <hi>Inter-regnum</hi> in the time of the Rabbling, and would not allow it in the Dr's Caſe, is no inconſiſtency: for in the firſt caſe the Exerciſe of Government was impoſſible; in the other there was actual Exerciſe of it. <hi>3ly</hi> When it was ſaid <hi>the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the Nation had owned</hi> William <hi>as their King:</hi> it was not meant (as he hath a mind to underſtand it) as complexly ſuch; but as Exerciſing the Supreme Regal Power, and deſigned to be compleatly King. I could give Scripture-Inſtances of ſuch manner of ſpeaking of Kings: if it were fit to enlarge as much on
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:150243:61"/>
this Head as he doth. <hi>4ly</hi> If it was not a Contempt of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Nation, to diſobey the Command of it's higheſt Power for the time, even tho' one ſhould attempt to give Reaſons (unleſs theſe Reaſons were alſo ſufficient, of which none of us are Judge) let any give Sentence. <hi>5ly</hi> He ſubtilizeth the Diſtinction too much between being King, and exerciſing the Regal Power: but to help out his fine Notion, he behoved to alter the Phraſe, putting <hi>Right to Exerciſe</hi> for <hi>Exerciſing</hi> it ſelf: I hope theſe two may be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; and that there may be not only a Phyſical, but a Moral impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment, for a time, of a Moral Right. His Notion of <hi>Exerciſing the Regal Power before taking the Oath, and that there is no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to take the Oath before the Coronation;</hi> I cannot yield to; but leave to Stateſmen, and Lawers to Debate it with him. I ſay the ſame of his Diſcourſe of Hereditary and Elective Kings.</p>
            <p>§. 18. That I called <hi>K. J. our lawful Soveraign,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>was a striking at the Root of the preſent Settlement.</hi> Anſwer, if I had ſo called him, with reſpect to the time of the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what he ſaith were true. But to ſay that he was ſo before this Government had it's being, and before the Nation in its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative had found and declared the contrary, is far from that blame. Next, he unfairly repreſenteth what I had ſaid, that <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy cannot be restored:</hi> I hope it never ſhall, and I am ſure it never can, without croſſing the Inſtitution of Chriſt. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the reſtoring of it be conſiſtent with the Civil Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Nation, as things are now ſtated, I leave it to Stateſ-men and Lawers to diſcuſs. His Commendation of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meronians,</hi> and blaming me for ſpeaking to their Diſadvantage, is not out of kindneſs to them, but in <hi>odium tertii;</hi> that he might make the ſober Presbyterians (for I cannot be bantered out of that Diſtinction) more hateful, as being worſe than they. I ſhould think it loſt time, to examine his quibbles about the Presbyterian Miniſters not preaching ſo much as he and his Complices thought was meet againſt the Rabling: theſe things were ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt by ſome, and that where ſuch Diſorders were moſt rampant and regnant: but Preaching could not Stem that Tide,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:150243:62"/>
many of theſe men would hear non of us, nor will they to this day (tho', through mercy, not a few of them are reclaimed) and ſome who liſtned to other Doctrine, would not hear that. He hath a wiſe inference, I had ſaid, <hi>theſe courſes were preached againſt both before they were acted, for preventing them: and after for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them; Ergo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it was a conſulted and deliberat Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick; and the Ministers were privy to it; and yet did not warn the poor men, that they might have eſcaped being rabled:</hi> I ſhall not give this its due Name; as he frequently giveth ill and undue Names to my Words. Miniſters knew an inclination to Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in ſome, that they went beyond their Stations, by an ill guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Zeal: and this they warned againſt, yea, and ſome Presbyterian Miniſters did proteſt againſt all theſe exaſperated men, when they beheld it: But that they knew Deſigns for theſe Diſorders in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, is falſe, and doth not follow from what was ſaid; He ſaith, he can name more than one or two of the firſt Rank of ſober <hi>Presbyterian Miniſters,</hi> (ſuch a Blunder and Repugnancy in me would have been called <hi>Ignorance, Non-ſenſe, Impudence,</hi> and what not) who adviſed to theſe Courſes. I ſolemnly declare I know not any of them, and if I did, I ſhould blame them.</p>
            <p>§. 19. He cometh next to <hi>Contradictions:</hi> ſome of which are fancied; others are real; but of his own making, by miſ-citing words; One is I have ſaid, <hi>where there are Biſhops the Presbyters have no Power,</hi> in another Book, <hi>we do not ſay that Biſhops take all Power from Presbyters.</hi> Any who will be at the pains to conſult the places that he citeth, will find that the firſt ſpeaketh of Governing Power; the other ſpeaketh of Power in General, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth preaching Power, but it is there expreſly ſaid, that they take away all Governing Power: Where is then the Contradiction: Next it is ſaid, (he knoweth not where it ſeems; nor do I) that <hi>King James</hi>'s <hi>Indulgence was against Law.</hi> And yet <hi>2d Vendic.</hi> p. 43. <hi>the Parliament had given the King ſuch Power.</hi> The firſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion I find not; another Aſſertion that to him will infer it, is, <hi>the Law was for publick Meetings, Ergo,</hi> privat Meetings were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Law; It is a pitiful Conſequence, Where Liberty is allowed,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:150243:62"/>
(as now in <hi>England</hi>) the Law is for both ways. Wherefore the ſecond Aſſertion maketh no <hi>Contradiction.</hi> But if both had been ſaid, there are juſt Laws, and unjuſt: which may without a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in the Aſſertion, be ſaid to contradict one another. This Diſtinction removeth alſo the next pretended <hi>Contradiction,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>Forefeiture being unjuſt, that the Authority of the Nation laid on, and Miniſters having no legal Right to their Stipends, when the Authority of the Nation have determined otherwiſe;</hi> Parliaments may both do right, and do wrong. Another <hi>Contradiction</hi> he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieth: <hi>Animadv. on Stillingf. Jrenic.</hi> It is aſſerted that <hi>all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters having got equal Power from Chriſt, they cannot ſo devolve their Power on one of themſelves, as to deprive themſelves of it: their Power being not a Licenſe only, but a Truſt.</hi> This he thinketh <hi>is contradicted indirectly, by delegating Members to the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</hi> To this I anſwer, Delegation to the General Aſſembly, is a Temporary, tranſient thing, for the exerciſe of one or a few Acts: and neceſſity doth warrant it, ſeing the Miniſters of a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot meet, without leaving almoſt the whole Nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Preaching, and other Ordinances, for a conſiderable time. This is not to be compared with devolving of the Power of the Miniſters of a whole Province on one Biſhop, who is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually (<hi>ad vitam aut culpam</hi>) to exerciſe the whole power of the Church, in all the Acts of it; ſo as all the reſt are deprived of it, and cannot exerciſe it, nor give account to God for the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. The one is very conſiſtent with that Parity that Chriſt made in communicating Church Power to his Servants, the other is not. He ſaith alſo, that I <hi>contradict the former Poſition directly,</hi> in <hi>true Repreſentation: &amp; 2d Vindic. by allowing the taking ruling Power from the prelatical Clergy.</hi> Beſide the Neceſſity, and unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled State of the Church in theſe Places, brought for juſtifying this Conduct, which he rather mocketh at than ſolidly anſwereth, I there at length inſiſted, to ſhew that there is no inconſiſtancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this, and our principle concerning Parity: I need ſay no more, till he anſwer what is already ſaid.</p>
            <p>§. 20. Another Contradiction he will needs make, between

my <hi>diſowning ſome Grounds of Separation in</hi> England, <hi>and owning the ſame in</hi> Scotland. The one in my <hi>Rational Defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet, the other in my <hi>ſecond Vindic. of the Church of</hi> Scotland, this he proſecuteth with a great deal of Clamor: what ſtrength is in his Diſcourſe, let us now try. I hope I ſhall be found <hi>ſemper idem,</hi> for all this noiſe. Three <hi>Grounds of Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> he mentioneth, wherein this <hi>Contradiction</hi> lyeth, firſt <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy. Anſwer,</hi> I ſaid the ſetting up <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in England, <hi>was not a ſufficient Ground for People to forbear hearing of the Word in their Pariſh Churches,</hi> I ſay the ſame with reſpect to <hi>Scotland.</hi> I ſaid <hi>Epiſcopacy was a good Ground for Miniſters to withdraw from Church Judicatories, where they muſt (at least interpretatively) own that Authority:</hi> I ſay the ſame of <hi>England.</hi> If he can find any thing in my words, that doth import any more than this, I ſhall owne a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> and the ſhame that it may infer. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is <hi>Epiſcopal Miniſters were <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers, or Intruders.</hi> The third is <hi>they had not the Peoples Call.</hi> I am ſure, I never made theſe to be two diſtinct things: but this Author's ſubtile Wit, hath divided them. Here I cannot own either <hi>Contradiction</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety.</hi> I approved the Conduct of many People in <hi>England,</hi> who by a <hi>tacit, and after Conſent, owned theſe men, as their Paſtors, and heard them, tho' they did not joyn with their unwarranted Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:</hi> I never condemned the ſame Practice in <hi>Scotland;</hi> but approved it by my Practice, and Doctrine. Only I pleaded, that what ever might be ſaid of their not giving Conſent, (which was alſo the Caſe of many in <hi>England,</hi>) they could not be Charged with Separation, while theſe men were obtruded on them, againſt the Laws of the Goſpel, eſpecially when they might hear their own lawfully called Miniſters, tho' in a Corner. I find no <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction</hi> here, neither in what he ſaith about the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which I ſtill think never made any new Duties, or ſins for the matter; but was a ſuperadded Tie to former Moral Obligations. I ſaid indeed that the <hi>Covenant National,</hi> and <hi>the Solemn League,</hi> made ſetting up of Epiſcopacy more ſinful than before: but I never ſaid, that either it made Epiſcopacy ſinful, where it was not ſo
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:150243:63"/>
before: nor that it made owning of it ſuch: tho' I am ſure it ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated the ſin of both.</p>
            <p>§. 21. His next Effort is to expoſe my Rejecting the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of ſome, who were brought to Atteſt the <hi>Rabbling:</hi> but in his way, (I know not what Freak took him,) he Digreſſeth to conſider the <hi>Preface to Animadv. on</hi> Stillingf. <hi>Irenic.</hi> which he will needs have to be written by the Author himſelf, on which he diſcanteth after his own manner, that is, not very Learnedly, nor Convincingly; I aſſure him, and (if he will not be aſſured, he having no great Eſteem of my Veracity,) I can aſſure the Reader, that the Author neither wrote that Preface, nor what is in the Title Page, nor knew that the Book was Printed, till after it was done; but was at 300 Miles diſtance from where it was done. The Metaphorical <hi>Death,</hi> ſpoken of in it, taken from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phraſe, of being <hi>Dead in Law,</hi> as the Nonconformiſt Miniſters then were, was but a ſorry Subject for a Learned Divine to practiſe upon, but he had a mind to write much, and had little to ſay, tho' he often pretendeth to have great Plenty of Matter. It is true I did, and do Queſtion the Truths of many Circumſtances, whereby the <hi>Rabblings</hi> were aggravated: and tho' he is pleaſed to ſay, that <hi>the whole Nation knoweth them,</hi> I affirm the Generality of the People, where theſe things were ſaid to be Acted, know the contrary: let the Reader, who hath not occaſion to enquire into the Matters of Fact, believe as he ſeeth Cauſe, or ſuſpend his Belief. I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver defend, nor deny the Hardſhips that ſome of the Epiſcopal Clergy met with from the Rabble: only I ſaid, and I inſiſt in it, that they were Repreſented moſt Diſingenuouſly in ſeveral Parts, and Circumſtances of them: his Vouchers I reject, (I mean ſome of them,) ours he rejecteth; which is ordinary in ſuch Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, wherefore unleſs the thing could come to a Legal Tryal, every one muſt believe as he ſeeth Cauſe. That <hi>I rejected by the Bulk all the Matters of Fact,</hi> is falſe, and injurious. I did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſeveral of them, and condemned them as unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Diſorders. It is a fooliſh Inference, <hi>no man can be a fit Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before a Court,</hi> becauſe we are not to believe all the Stories
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:150243:64"/>
that men tell of themſelves, or their Friends. That I <hi>had my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations in theſe things moſtly from Rabblers themſelves,</hi> is falſly aſſerted, as may be ſeen by any who Impartially conſider the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Vindication.</hi> His expoſing that <hi>ſecond Vindication,</hi> becauſe I <hi>had the Accounts of Matters of Fact from other hands, and was not Eye, nor Ear-Witneſs to them,</hi> is odd; for what Hiſtorian is there, who may not be, on the ſame Account, blamed. The Book he ſpeaketh of, <hi>Account of the late Establiſhment of the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Government, by the Parliament,</hi> I have not ſeen, nor heard of it before. I <hi>thanked the Parliament,</hi> in the Preface to my Sermon before them, <hi>for their Act, Eſtabliſhing Presbyterian Government,</hi> can any wiſe man thence Infer, that I commended whatever was beſide Incorporated into that Act? Therefore all his long Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on that head, is impertinent. Another terrible <hi>Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> is, I ſay <hi>Field Meetings were ſometimes neceſſary:</hi> and yet <hi>they were Condemned by the Wiſest and Soberest Presbyterians.</hi> If I had ſaid they were in all Caſes ſo Condemned, he might have Inſulted: but may not I <hi>always,</hi> that is at all times, be of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that a thing ſhould not be done, as I ſee it often done, and without Neceſſity, and yet think that there may be a Caſe of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, where it may be done; this is to Cavil, not to Reaſon.</p>
            <p>§. 22. The Envenomed Words, in ſome Pages that follow, wherewith he Concludeth his Preface, and theſe of the ſame Sort, wherewith it Interſperſed, I diſregard: he doth himſelf more Hurt by them, than me: I reſolve not to be Hector'd, nor Banter'd out of my Principles, nor Scarred by Malice, or Reproach from ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in my Mite, for the Defence of Truth, tho' he, and ſuch as he Conſpire to Overwhelm me, partly with their Books, and partly with their Calumnious Imputations. It is not uſual for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſo to Rage againſt a bad Cauſe. Theſe few Pages I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>raptim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the Preſs waiting for them: if he, or any other will Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them fairly, with that Candor that becometh a Chriſtian, and a Diſputant; I ſhall be willing to be Corrected, if any thing have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped my Pen; if he or they write in the ſame Strain of this Preface, I will Deſpiſe them, as alſo will all Sober and Intelligent Readers.</p>
