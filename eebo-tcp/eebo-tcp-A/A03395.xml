            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

her tragicall effects; This of which
I now vndertake to write, deſerues a

            <p>
               <hi>Italy</hi> hath beene in all times a region
fertile in high and noble ſpirits, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the greateſt and fulleſt fruits of
vertue or vice, and alſo the moſt amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and ſubiect to loue of all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
which hath beene the occaſion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19405:4"/>
that the men (finding this inclination
ſo common and naturall to them) haue
ordained the lawes for the liues of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſo ſtrict &amp; ſeuere in their reſtraint,
to which they ſubiect them, as not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured

of the ſight and frequentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of men, excepting onely the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of their neere allies. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all the Townes of <hi>Italy,</hi> where
vertues and faire exerciſes are in greateſt
recommendation, and where is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the beſt and nobleſt company,
<hi>Naples</hi> is one of the chiefe, and where
there is a greater liberty then in other
Cities of the Countrey. In this Citie
there liued a Gentleman, <hi>Fabritio</hi> by
name, who as well for the much deſert
of his vertues, as for the noblenes of his
deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, held the place of one of the moſt
honoured Magiſtrates of the Citie; In
which charge he ſo wel demeaned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and got himſelfe ſo good a reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19405:5"/>
as hauing buried one Wife, hee
married a ſecond, of birth and meanes
much aboue his owne: for though
both Nature and Fortune had yeelded
him enough, yet they both had more
aduantaged her than him. This Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
by name <hi>Liuia,</hi> had to her firſt
Husband a Lord of the beſt bloud of
the Countrey, who left her two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
the eldeſt named <hi>Pompeio,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Cornelio. Fabritio</hi> had by his
firſt Wife amongſt other children a
daughter named <hi>Iſabella,</hi> the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
an excellent beauty with which
ſhe was adorned, was endowed with ſo
great an vnderſtanding, as ſhe ſeemed
not onely to ſurpaſſe thoſe of her age,
(which was then about fifteene or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeares) but to leaue ſhort of her,
all thoſe that euer nature had produced
excellent of her ſex, in ſuch ſort as ſhee
was eſteemed and admired of all as the
wonder of her time. And that which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19405:5"/>
yeelded her more luſter, was a certaine
braue and proud faſhion, but ſuted with
a ſweetneſſe agreeable to her age and
condition, that made her loued and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
both at once. Thoſe whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath giuen to taſte the ſweetneſſe
of a fatherly loue, may imagine what
pleaſure and contentment Signiour <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britio</hi>
receiued in being father of many
hopefull children, eſpecially of ſo rare a
treaſure as this daughter, being withall
fauoured with ſo great an increaſe of
fortunes, and conuenience (by this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
marriage) to breed &amp; more high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
aduance his children, and chiefly his
<hi>Iſabella:</hi> for whom he &amp; his wife <hi>Liuia</hi>
had deſigned a marriage with <hi>Pompeio</hi>
(her eldeſt Son by her firſt Husband)
who of her part alſo was moſt glad to
haue ſo happily found for her ſelfe ſo
good a Daughter, &amp; her Son ſo faire a
Wife, breeding her more carefully then
if ſhe had been her naturall childe. The
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19405:6"/>
good and commendable proiect of this
marriage being agreed on by theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and whereon they built the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
happineſſe of their houſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
brought them much more ruine
then it had promiſed them content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
being the ordinary pleaſure of
fortune to build vpon the foundation
of our deſignes, euents moſt contrary
to our hopes. This Maid to whom the
greatneſſe of her wit (with her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Letters) did aduance the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of her ſoule to the iudging of
things farre aboue her ſex, or what her
age might ſeeme to beare, did make her
alſo diſdaine that which ſhe thought
vnworthy of her faire parts, beſtowing
her time more on priuacy than conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
partly in ſtudie, partly in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke;
ſometime marrying with her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
her voyce which ſhe had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
ſweet; ſometime vſing her Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in working ſome rare ſtorie or curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19405:6"/>
Hieroglifique, that euery thing
might be a witneſſe of the well-ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of her time.</p>
            <p>Being arriued at the ſeauenteenth
yeare of her age, ſhe had notice giuen
her by her father of her appointed huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
with much diſcourſe of the ſence
ſhe ought to haue of ſo good a fortune.
To which ſhe made ſuch anſwer, as a
Father may expect from ſuch a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
who beſought him onely to leaue
yet awhile ſome liberty to her youth,
and time to frame her ſelfe to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of a Husband.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liuia</hi> being diſcreet and wiſe, and
knowing many imperfections in her
Sonne, had left him to abide euer ſince
her marriage in a Countrey houſe of
hers, ſome eight or ten miles from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
where ſhe kept diſcreet and well-faſhioned
people about him, to the end
to correct and ſome way amend the ill
habits of his minde and body, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19405:7"/>
he was borne vnpleaſing to the
eye, and very vncapable of any thing
gentle or vertuous: but as it is vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ouercome ſo great an enemy as
Nature, (which though you beat from
you, yet will returne againe) ſo proued
the care of his Mother, and the paine
of thoſe about him moſt vnprofitable
to this young man, who hauing attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the age of twenty two yeares,
was then aduertiſed by his Mother of
her intention for his mariage, of which
the beauty of this faire Maid made him
ſo greedily deſirous, that after his firſt
fight of her, he had no diſpoſition to be
from his Miſtreſſe, who then began to
looke better vpon him then ſhe was
woont to doe before ſhe knew her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
pleaſure. So frequentation made
her know him, and her knowledge of
him to diſdaine him: her diſdaine bred
hatred, her hate deſpaire, and deſpaire
thoſe ſtrange reſolutions in her that you
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19405:7"/>
ſhall hereafter vnderſtand. In this
time an Vncle of hers, called <hi>Hipolito,</hi>
was returned home from <hi>Bolonia,</hi> where
he had remained foure or fiue yeares, as
well to ſtudy, as to learne Horſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
Fenſing, Muſicke, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
parts befitting a Gentleman,
in which hauing beſtowed himſelfe to
the age of one or two and twenty yeres,
his elder Brother (who aſſumed the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a Father) thought it fit to call
him home to aduiſe with him of the
ſetling of his eſtate.</p>
            <p>This young man being returned
to <hi>Naples,</hi> faire mannered, handſome,
that knew to dreſſe himſelfe well, and
whoſe ſpeech was gracefull and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
was foorthwith knowne and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
of all, but chiefly of his Neece,
with whom (as well through the affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their natures and yeares, as of their
bloud) he was receiued into that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
degree of friendſhip and primacy,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19405:8"/>
as if he had been her Brother; yea more,
they had ſo great a communication and
mutuall relation each with other, as
they were growne to eſteeme it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury
to themſelues not to make each
maſter of the others neereſt thoughts.
They had not long liued in this faſhion
when the young Maid acquainted him
with her appointed marriage, and her
little affection to it, complaining much
of the cruelty of her fortune, and the
ſeuere reſolution of her Father to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
her with a man ſo ill ſuting her in
euery thing, and who (ſetting aſide the
aduantage of his birth and meanes) had
nothing in him remarkable.</p>
            <p>The company of this Vnckle of hers
increaſed ſtill her diſdaine againſt her
louer, by the approofe hee gaue of her
opinion of the others wants, whoſe
company annoyed them both more
then they were pleaſed with, in ſuch
ſort, as they ſought all meanes to free
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19405:8"/>
themſelues of it, and retire to reading
and other mutuall pleaſures betweene
themſelues. But as it is eaſie and moſt
ordinary for extremities euen in vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things to ſlip into vices; ſo this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
friendſhip could not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it ſelfe within the bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of his duty, but growing to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
liberty by their priuate frequenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
began to be accompanied with a
certaine vnmeaſured doting vpon this
retiredneſſe, and a melancholy paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
griefe in abſence each of the other,
and a loathing of all other company,
and in concluſion, (it being the cuſtome
of their age to diſcourſe of loue more

with them, that it became the maſter
of both their hearts. And although
their yeares had as yet giuen them little
practiſe in this affaire, and that feare
tooke from him, and ſhame from her,
the ordinary meanes of declaring their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19405:9"/>
affections; yet the quickneſſe of both
their apprehenſions made them both
ſoone acquainted with their reciprocall
paſſions. Which incouraged <hi>Hipolito</hi>
one time among the reſt, to take this
aduantage of a diſcourſe they had had
of loue, and the thraldome his ſubiects
liue in, and ſpeake to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Certainly Neece I haue read a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime
which I now receiue for purer
truth then heretofore, that men cannot
rightly iudge or diſcourſe of the true
quality of any paſſion without hauing
had ſome triall or feeling of it himſelfe,
and whereas I haue diuers times with
your ſelfe and others, inforced in
my diſcourſes what I had read and
heard of the ſtrange effects of loue, and
how there is no paſſion nor any part of
the ſoule that yeelds not to it, and that
reaſon and prudence are able to make
but weake reſiſtance againſt it, yet I
muſt confeſſe I ſpeake rather for argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19405:9"/>
ſake, then beleeuing in the trueth
of what I related, eſteeming indeed,
that affect the eaſieſt to gouerne and
hide of moſt others. But I muſt now
confeſſe all true, and much more then I
could haue ſaid or can, that might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the admirable effects that loue
produces, and ſtrong hand it holds
ouer our reaſonable part.</p>
            <p>How now Vncle! (anſwered ſhee)
will the lawes of our friendſhip allow
this, that you haue thought one thing,
and ſpoken another to me? Pardon me
Neece (anſwered <hi>Hipolito</hi>) it hath not
beene that I would barre you of any
thought in my boſome, nor that I
would, or alas could hide this from
you; feare onely hath denied mee the
libertie. Neither thinke (I beſeech
you) that I would any way offend you,
or faile in the leaſt cauſe of a friends
dutie, but rather double my reſpect and
obſeruance, as the ſubiect and cauſe is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19405:10"/>
increaſed; and will beleeue that the
occaſion of this diſcourſe is happened
mee by fate, to remooue my feare,
and giue you ſome occaſion to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
the power of this deitie in mee,
whom of a free man it hath made a
captiue, and inſtead of that Vncle and
friend, I haue beene hitherto to you,
your ſeruant and vaſſall; and turned all
my free thoughts into ſo deuoted an
obſeruance, that they haue no will left
to will any thing but obedience to your
thoughts, to honour you, to deſire you,
and laſtly, to make me ſo acceptable to
you, as to bee by you, onely eſteemed
worthy your affection.</p>
            <p>The teares and earneſt ſighes that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed
theſe words, ſtayed them
there, and made her no leſſe amazed at
their vnexpected nouelty, then trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and doubtfull, what anſwere ſhee
might fitteſt make to them: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
of her paſſion of the one ſide
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19405:10"/>
more then halfe yeelding, and of the
other, her maiden baſhfulneſſe drawing
her with no leſſe violence backe; at
laſt after a little ſilence, the witneſſe of
ſome change in her thoughts, quoth
ſhe, I doe now finde it true that I haue
heard wiſe people ſay; that a vertuous
and faire appearance often couers a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
deſigne; and for this reaſon, if ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
had not beene ordained to our
ſexe, I had ſo diſpoſed of my ſelfe, as
to ſhunne the vnhappy conſequence,
which ordinarily (by my obſeruation)
follow the ſocietie and haunting with
men, euen thoſe that opinion rankes
amongſt the honeſteſt, but you I
thought ſo innocent of diſſembled pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
and all your courſes ſo led by
vertue, as nothing but your ſelfe could
haue perſwaded mee (I being what I
am) you would haue intended any

hold deerer then my life. I ſee the too

of my humour, it being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
impoſſible you ſhould attempt
the honour of one ſo neere you, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
binds you to the preſeruation of it;
but ſince it is thus, I hope hereafter to
let you better ſee, I deteſt theſe things,
and neither your ſubtiltie nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
pleaſe me.</p>
            <p>Thoſe which being young beginners
in loue, haue to an extreame paſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
ſuch a refuſall, may conceiue the
anguiſh this anſwere brought to poore
<hi>Hipolito;</hi> who thought he heard a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
againſt his life; and looſing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
ſpeech, and vnderſtanding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
a good while without ſpeaking;
at laſt returning to himſelfe as from an

of ſighes as words, hee made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19405:11"/>
If my fortune haue led me to an
enterprize ſo harmefull to my ſelfe, and
to you ſo offenſiue; your perfections,
the diuine force of loue, or my cruell
deſtinies, not my will muſt be accuſed;
which hath but by violent neceſſitie
offended you. O be ſatisfied with the
infinitie of thoſe other miſeries that I
ſee prepared for me, without adding to
them the priuation of your company,
and leaue mee yet the ſhort comfort of
that trouble, whereof I hope ere long,
by the end of my life to deliuer you, &amp;
my ſelfe by the ſame meane, from the
puniſhment of myraſhneſſe, the which
I earneſtly beſeech you not to imagine
to haue beene guided by any craft or
ſubtiltie. I haue all my life had this
vice of diſſimulation in too great a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
to bee able now to vſe it; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with you, towards whom (though
it were familiar to me) yet the lawes of
my affinitie and loue would forbid it

my wordes; and the reſpect of your

then friendſhip may diſpence with you

            <p>He was beginning to ſay more, when
one came to call them to ſupper; ſo as
<hi>Iſabella</hi> had onely leiſure to tell him,
that ſhe was to heare no more of thoſe
matters: which thruſt him yet farther
into deſpaire; by which occaſion, and
the many teares hee had ſhed, his face
was ſo changed, that hee was faine to
perſwade his brother and ſiſter in law,
that hee was not well, ſo excuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19405:12"/>
for not ſupping, he went to a houſe
of another of his brothers, a Notary,
a rich man, and there lodged with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
fourth brother named <hi>Scipio</hi>
ſomewhat elder then himſelfe, where
hee lay with opinion of euery one that
hee was ſicke as hee ſeemed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued
his brother from his chamber,
to the end to enioy more fully the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of his plaints and paſſions, which
all the night held him in ſuch vnreſt,
as he not onely ſlept not, but fell into a
feauer, a fit bodily diſguiſe for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of his minde. Hee lay foure
daies contending in his reaſon, with
loue for the maſtery: and to beate him
from the hold hee had got in him, but
alas, what reſiſtance can men make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
gods? Hee was already in the
ſnare, which the more hee ſtrugled to
get free of, ſtill the faſter held him,
and was forced backe to the purſuit
of his vnfortunate loue. Hee reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19405:13"/>
to take more courage, and to write
to his miſtreſſe, ſince hee had neither
meanes nor aſſurance to ſee her.</p>
            <p>She was no leſſe diuided, by as great
a ciuill warre of loue, ſometimes accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
her ſelfe of ingratitude, ſometimes
of crueltie, for caſting him ſhee loued
beſt of all worldly things, into ſo great
a diſpaire: of this ſhe would excuſe her
ſelfe vpon a greater fault, that ſhee had
too eaſily receiued the firſt offer of his
ſeruice, whom diuine, humane, and the
lawes of publique honeſty, had forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
her.</p>
            <p>In the meane time <hi>Hipolito</hi> was often
viſited by his brother <hi>Fabritio,</hi> and had
ſpeech with him of the marriage of
<hi>Pompeio</hi> with his daughter, which hee
ſeemed much to approoue of, wiſely
diſſembling his griefe, and offring <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peio</hi>
his ſeruice in all good offices to his

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19405:13"/>
               <hi>Hipolito's</hi> foote-man, fit enough for ſuch

from his maſter, faining to bee onely

            <p>The Lady <hi>Iſabella</hi> her Neece, had

Brother, either it is your ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

I may ſay, I ſcarce know you, or you
haue ſomewhat in your minde, that you
will keepe to your ſelfe, that makes

take not heede. You know there is no
diſeaſe more dangerous then that of the

nor Apothecaries any Drugge, that
may auaile to heale it: the beſt thing for

where can you expect it more faithfull,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19405:17"/>
then from me, who you know haue not

(anſwered <hi>Hipolito</hi>) my affection to

to bee ſhaken, or indangered by any
earthly accident, nor haue I euer
doubted of the abilitie of your vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
but my deſpaire of remedy

to giue it you; for giue me good Siſter,
and ſince you can in nothing helpe, let
mee alone endure the penance of my
idle thoughts. How? (anſwered ſhe)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19405:17"/>
where is the reſolution you men attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to your ſelues aboue the courage
of women? Certainely, your part of it
is very little, that you diſpaire of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting,
before you attempt the meanes;
if your owne inuention doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
giue you a ſmoothe way to your
deſires, you muſt not therefore thinke
that others cannot finde it out for you,
the fulleſt vnderſtandings, in their
owne affaires are diſtruſtfull, and for
feare of looſing themſelues, doe often
repaire to the faith of a friend for their
reſolution. If I can ſerue in nothing
elſe but to keepe your griefes for you,
it is no little lightning to a heauy and
oppreſſed heart, to leaue his vexations
with thoſe he knowes, will affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imbrace all, to take but a part from
him. The principall effects of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
are helpe and conſolation; though
I bee vnuſefull for the one; yet am I
moſt fit for the other, and I hope able
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19405:18"/>
for both. God often times raiſes the
meanes of our reliefe beyond our hope,
and from thoſe we leſt expect it: deere
Siſter (anſwered he) out of the meere
dutie of my loue, and no hope at all of
any allay to my griefes; I will tell you
their ſubiect, which ſhame ought ſtill
as much to conceale, as reuerence to
the lawes of Nature, ſhould haue at firſt
forbidden. Know (deere Siſter) I haue
beene ſo long engaged, that now in
deſpight of my beſt oppoſitions, I am
conſtrained to giue my ſelfe vp to the

beene, and is the occaſion of my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
and muſt ſo remaine as long as
my vnhappy fate ſhall allow mee life:
behold the laborinth of my paines, and
the little meanes I haue to get out, ſince
I am already gone on ſo farre. With
this he tould her the diſcourſe of all had
paſt betweene them, ſhewing her the
letters he had writ, and her anſwers to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19405:18"/>
them. To which his Siſter ſaid, I finde
now that one of the greateſt faults that
the Ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts haue made in the picture of
Loue is in blinding his eyes, for though
he indifferently diſperſeth his ſhafts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all ſorts of creatures, yet the eie
was neuer againſt this effect, and in that
reſpect they needed not haue blindfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, but this marke I ſee belongs
better to thoſe whom hee hath once
touch't, and whom he leaueth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
blinde in body, but euen eſtranged
from all due conſiderations of the
minde, ſo much as they remaine inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
confuſed and loſt in themſelues,
without ability to make vſe of their
owne vnderſtandings.</p>
            <p>Oh how truely was it ſaid of that
Phyloſpher, that for the moſt part wee
make things difficult and impoſſible to
our ſelues for want of courage to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
them! Make your ſelfe (Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
iudge of this in your ſelfe, who
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19405:19"/>
vpon the firſt difficulty that affronts
you in your deſigne, remaine aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
and confounded. You loue a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that is vpon the point of marriage
with another. There are many marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
intended, yet ſo croſt, as they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
arriue to their conſummation: and
though that muſt be, yet were not that
the worſt that might happen you; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
often bringing conuenience to
loue. Next, you loue one that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
marry? Well? and hath loue no
other ends for his contentment, then
marriage? ſince it as often diſſeuers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
as it ioynes them, while being
ſubiected to the lawes of an obligation
and dutie, you diſarme him of his chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
forces. A wife (though neuer ſo
faire) is like a gueſt, or the raine that
becomes a trouble in three dayes.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, I loue one whom
the lawes doe forbid me both all deſire
and all hope to enioy, which ſo diſtracts
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19405:19"/>
me in this thornie way, as I am there
ruined with the impoſſibilitie of getting
out. You are not the firſt that haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
things as much forbidden,
which haue yet attained to a happie
end. Thinke vertue conſiſts in great
and difficult things, and is pleaſed in a

there is in an affaire, the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
followes the enterprize, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the excution: the attempt may
content you, whether you gather the

            <p>All theſe faire promiſes of the Nunne
wrought little in her Brothers beleefe;
onely they ſo farre reſtored him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
as that commending his loue to
her care, with more affection then he
would haue done his life, he returned
to his Brother the Notaries houſe till
the next day after dinner, when hee
went to ſee <hi>Fabritio,</hi> and (vnder that
pretence) his Daughter <hi>Iſabella,</hi> where
he receiued the gladdeſt welcome from
Brother, Siſter, Neece, and Signiour

her to go the next day to the Nuns
to Veſpers, if ſhe could get leaue, which

in whom ſhe wholly affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This commoditie gaue <hi>Hipolito</hi> a
preſage of his good fortune, and her the
firſt danger of her ruine, whereof ſhe
had ſome apprehenſion at her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for getting vp into the Coach, a
weakneſſe ſeized her, with a head-ache,
and a cold ſweat all ouer her bodie, and
hauing been a while in the Coach, the
Horſes that vſed before times to be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
enough, began to ſtart, and ruſh one
vpon the other, with ſuch force and
confuſion as droue the Coachman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
danger of his life, who had much a
doe to bring them into order againe.
Theſe accidents not a little affrighted
the vnderſtanding of the vnfortunate
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19405:22"/>
Ladie: but the force of our deſtinie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
driues vs to what is fatally or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to vs; ſo theſe things could no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hinder her from the perſuit of her
misfortunes, in ſpight of all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
of either her feare, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Being arriued at the Nunnerie, ſhee
found her Vncle and her Aunt walking
together in a Garden, there attending
her comming, who aſſoone as they had
perceiued her, and ſeeing her paler then
ſhe vſed to be, her Aunt ſaid to her;
Certainly Neece you haue not brought
your beſt lookes hither, me thinks you
are afraid of ſhaming my Brother, and
therefore will partake with his ſickly
lookes. Then <hi>Iſabella</hi> told them what
had happened her in her comming, and
occaſioned that feare which perhaps
her lookes had ſtill retained.</p>
            <p>Well then (ſaid the Nunne) ſince ye
are both of you ill at eaſe, my counſaile
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19405:22"/>
is, that ye repoſe your ſelues, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with to daies deuotion. <hi>Iulia</hi>
and I will go heare the Veſpers for you.
No good Aunt (ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi>) I came
not here to ſee your Garden; I will go
heare ſeruice with you and I thinke my
Vncle is here for the ſame purpoſe too.
God will be no leſſe pleaſed (anſwered
the Nunne) with your wills, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
more, then if ye did what might
preiudice your healths. The Diuines
ſay, that although in the affirmatiue
precepts of pietie one be not alwaies
buſied in the action affirmatiue, yet that
the ſight alone ſufficeth: in precepts
negatiue, the troth is, we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant,
and bent to the action nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.
Stay here, ſtay, I will take your
ſinne vpon me; and with that went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
carrying <hi>Iulia</hi> along with her.
Well Neece (ſaid <hi>Hipolito</hi>) let vs ſtay
then, ſince it is my Siſters counſaile, and
taking her by the hand, led her to ſit
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19405:23"/>
vnder a hanging roofe couered with
Gelſomines and Musk-Roſes, and gan
to ſpeake to her in this ſort.</p>
            <p>If euer man had reaſon to praiſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
it muſt be I, for the happineſſe I
now receiue in this meanes offered me,
to returne you my due humble thankes
for the honour of your Letters in my
ſickneſſe: and to vnfold the thoughts
of my ſoule to you; to the end that
comprehending them better then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
you haue ſuffered your ſelfe to
do, you will daine to receiue my griefes
and relieue them. I beſeech you then
take my words in that good part that
my affection deſerues, and with ſuch
pitie of my afflictions as your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ought to moue you to. I will not
importune you with the repetition of
any my former diſcourſes, you may
haue remembred enough to found your
determination vpon, and to know the
bounds of mine intentions ſo limitted,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19405:23"/>
as that I nor pretend, nor deſire
ought of you that is not in all honeſtie
and honour permitted: nor more then
a preheminence of affection, ſuch as
loue may ſtabliſh in a heart, that is, to
giue the fruits to others, for whom they
are by the ſuperſtition of our lawes, and
their fauourable deſtinies more happily
reſerued. All I deſire is, that as all my
thoughts are dedicated and vowed to
the ſeruice, honour, and loue of the
heauenly vertues of your ſoule, and all
my wiſhes but to be acceptable to you;
yours may ſo farre anſwer them, as to
ſet all other friendſhip and affections
behinde mine, &amp; ſo farre diſtinguiſh my
portion in you from other mens, as not
to receiue them in compariſon or equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
with me. Pay me no more then for
Gods ſake with the loue of a Neece,
which may be common to many more;
and iudging aright of my deuotions,
receiue them, ſince they tend not to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19405:24"/>
your preiudice, nor to any thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
or interdicted.</p>
            <p>I had thought Vncle (anſwered <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>)
I had ſo ſatisfied you by my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as you had remained as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
as you haue cauſe to be, and that
your reaſon had had the power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe
thoſe vaine fantaſies that had
clouded your iudgement; but for ought
I ſee, the worke is new to begin: would
to God I had beleft thoſe preſages that
ſhould haue diuerted me from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to this place to enter anew into
our wonted conteſtations. I know
(Vncle) that all deſires tend vnto the
end of their contentment. You ſay that
that of your loue is fixed vpon the
ſoule, and thoſe perfections which you
make your ſelfe beleeue mine is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with. Theſe are ſtill for ought I
can perceiue thoſe firſt diſſembled pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations,
by which thoſe that are ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with your paſſion, are woont to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19405:24"/>
abuſe ſuch as they finde eaſie of beleefe,
and within the bounds whereof they
determine not to keepe themſelues: and
though there might be found ſome
men ſo diſcreet as would be content to
be ſo limited, yet loue ſtill being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their maſter, and hauing taken
from them all power of ruling and
bounding their will, and bowing it to
the appetites of the bodie (which is
moſt conuerſant with vs) it ſoone wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the wit and ſpirit with the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of things ſeperated from huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
and drawes it to the purſuit of
thoſe delights and pleaſures, to which
our ſences and appetites doe leade vs.
Doe you not know that the brands or
Torches which they paint in <hi>Cupids</hi>
hands betoken his double and different
effects? for as the light of the fire plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the eies, and reioyceth vs when we
behold it onely, and not feele the heate
too neere vs; but when it comes to burne
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19405:25"/>
vs, we ſuffer then the hurt of that thing
that before ſo much delighted vs; euen
ſo Loue hath his beginnings pleaſing,
becauſe he doth not at firſt poſſeſſe and
take vp the diſcourſe of our reaſon, and
repreſents nothing to vs for a while but
the ſweetneſſe of a felicitie and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which he ſets before vs, and makes
vs eaſily hope for: but when hee hath
once ſeized vs wholly, as hee takes his
poſſeſſion, hee dazels vs with the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
appearances of his pleaſures, and
putting vs into the middeſt of his flame,
melts and makes to waſte from vs all the
freedome of our reaſon and iudgement
that wee had before. It were better
therefore (good Vncle) you draw back
the firſt foot you haue ſet into it, before
the other follow it, and faile you too,
and not to deſire of me what I can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
giue, nor you ought to pretend
vnto. You know I am vpon the point
of marriage: if ill hap diſcouer your
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19405:25"/>
addreſſes (as time if you perſeuere can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
long hide them) you not onely ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
this my fortune, which brings mee
profit, if not contentment, but with it
my reputation; and be aſſured, if I giue
you not a moſt ample content, it is not
want of will but power.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe which <hi>Hipolito</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to come from a ſincere truth, and
not mingled with diſſimulation, ſent
him backe to his old feuer, and made
him ſpeake thus. Neece, why ſhould
you not conceiue my loue rather placed
betweene <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> that
is, betweene Reaſon and Courage, as
ancient Academies haue painted him,
then betweene voluptuous pleaſure and
vnfaithfulneſſe, where you ſeate him?
Why, will you not allow him vertue
for his obiect, before a baſe luſt, and
which you forbid me too? Why, will
you rather thinke me wicked and falſe,
then ſuch as I am, and you haue reaſon
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19405:26"/>
to iudge me? I could eaſily anſwer the
ſcrupulous ceremonies of law with
which you combate me. The holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
offers mee examples of ſuch, and
things much farther in neereneſſe of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance.
The force of loue is diuine, and
may iuſtifie vs againſt all ciuill or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
ordinances. But I will not goe
ſo farre, nor alter the ſtile of my firſt
language, or ouerthrow your marriage,
much leſſe your reputation. I haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
proteſted, but ſince ſo vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably,
I finde death muſt end my loue,
and deſpaire; and I hope it will not be
long firſt: I ſhall not be alone vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,
when like <hi>Timageres</hi> you happily
will too late repent the ruine of your
<hi>Miletus,</hi> and ſo reuenge vpon your
owne ſelfe your crueltie. In ſpeaking
this, the teares fell from his eies, and
drew as many from <hi>Iſabella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As they were taking new heart and
ſpeech, the Nunne returned from her
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19405:26"/>
ſhort Veſpers, and at the entrance of the
Garden (to be freed from <hi>Iulia</hi>) gaue
her her Pſalter, to deliuer her Maid,
willing them to prouide ſome collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And comming to her Brother and
Neece, a little ſmiling, quoth ſhe: how
now ſweet hearts, I am affraid you haue
ſpent this time ill you are both ſo ſad,
make mee a partner of your entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
though I be not ſo cunning as
you worldlings, yet I am not ſuch an
innocent as my habit ſpeakes me, I haue
bookes ye know of other vſe then to
the Church; nor am I altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practized
in any thing; feare not to giue
me your diſcourſe, for ſhould it be euen
of Loue, I might be able to put in a

or how little the ſtrict guard of
<hi>Danaë, Laeda,</hi> and many others, could
preuent the powerfull workings of this
God? There is nothing that his brands
cannot fire, or his arrowes pierce; and
I had ill ſpent my time in the houſe of
your dead Mother, who was the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
I loued beſt in this world, and
whoſe memory I doe moſt honour, if I
had learned nothing of this.</p>
            <p>My Mother Aunt (anſwered <hi>Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>)
what can you ſay of her? I was not
ſo bleſt as to ſee her in an age fit to iudge
of her condition, but ſure ſhe died with
a more faire and vnqueſtioned reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then (if her life and maners had
not throughly deſerued it) this age
would haue giuen her.</p>
            <p>Neece (anſwered the Nunne) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
vndoth vs but indiſcretion: your
Mother was happie in placing her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19405:27"/>
vpon a wiſe and reſpectfull Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
and ſhe of her part was in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
vnwarie. This preſerued her, and
will keepe vp the honour and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of all that ioyne it with their loue.
I will giue you the whole truth, for I
ſaw it.</p>
            <p>The yeare I was profeſt Nunne (it is
ſome eighteene yeares ſince) the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe
of <hi>Coria</hi> was ſent to this Towne
in buſineſſe of his Maieſties; he ſtayed
here ſome ſeuen or eight moneths, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
the time his great employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
left him in the nobleſt exerciſes,
and moſt worthy his qualitie; hee was
ſome fiue and thirtie yeares old, and the
moſt accompliſhed man that I euer ſaw.
The Lords and Gentry to doe him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
made him many feaſts, and there
alwaies followed Balls, Maſques, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
and other pleaſurable paſtimes,
in which he would againe returne his
thankes to them. He tooke much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19405:28"/>
in Maſques, for the priuiledge it
gaue him of diſcourſing with Ladies.
My eldeſt Brother was the man of this
Towne he moſt affied in, and to whom
he did moſt freely impart his negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
my Siſter the woman that pleaſed
him beſt, finding her excellently faire,
well graced, of a pleaſing diſcourſe, and
an vnderſtanding aboue the reſt. This
inclination grew to a loue, in which he
gouerned himſelfe ſo well, and ſo well
diſguiſed it, that he eſcaped all ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He reſolued to impart it to my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
but with ſuch fitneſſe as none but
ſhee, or ſome moſt truſted woman
ſhould know it. And knowing the
common curioſity and ſudden ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that ordinarily follow neere fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentations
in thoſe kinds, might ſoone
ruine his hopes, he retained ſtill his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
modeſt faſhion and ſeemings.
But the Carneuall drawing neere, the
Maſques and daunces were alſo more
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19405:28"/>
frequent, and gaue him more conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to ſpeake to her, &amp; entertaine her
as hee did; yet ſo diſguized, as though
hee was knowne to bee in the troupe,
yet hee was vnknowne to all but her, to
whom (finding, or preſuming, that ſhe
was not diſpleaſed, hee ſhould make
more eſtimation of her then the reſt)
hee gaue a ſigne to know him by,
which made the meanes of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
more eaſie. And after hauing
enough by generall and doubtfull
words, giuen her the chiefe end and
aime of his deſires, at laſt, hee reuealed
himſelfe wholly to her.</p>
            <p>To bee ſhort, his diſcretion ſo mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his affaire for him, as that helpt
with the force of his vertue and noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
(and the ſeruice of my Siſters
Nurce, whom hee found meanes to
gaine, and make the meſſenger of his
letters) hee led my Siſter to ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
as that (conuenience and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19405:29"/>
permitting) ſhee gaue him promiſe
of ſight, and ſpeech with her in more
priuacy. Such as are practiſed in <hi>Italy,</hi>
and <hi>Spaine,</hi> vnderſtand well enough,
what ſuch permiſſions doe promiſe to
thoſe that women haue a will to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.
To bring this to paſſe, there
happened a very fit meane; which was
the neceſſitie of an affaire of import for
the Kings ſeruice, wherein hee was to
ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> out of hand to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
The Marqueſſe (and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
by his aduice) iudged my Brother,
fitter then any other for this purpoſe;
whereupon, ſoone as the Carneuall was
ended, my brother made that voyage,
where hee was fiue or ſixe weekes; in
which time, the Marqueſſe taking the
occaſion, found meanes to viſit my
Siſter by night, following her permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which ſtretch't at length euen to
the point, whither they ſay loue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends;
with ſuch continuance as that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19405:29"/>
euery ſecond night he viſited her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
euer hauing bin diſcouered by any
but my Siſters Nurce, who lay in her
Chamber, and I in her inner Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
by reaſon of a ſickeneſſe I had, that
made me leaue the Monaſtery a while,
to bee the better tended in my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſe? And, who not being yet
throughly recouered, ſlept not ſo
ſoundly, but I ſometimes heard ſoft
noiſes of doores, and murmures of
words, which put me into a little ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with ſome other things that I had
already beene imployed about, which
kept mee ſtill in doubt: In ſuch ſort, as
one day I caſt out a word to my ſiſter;
who ſo rebuked me, that I neuer after
durſt ſpeake any more to her of it.</p>
            <p>But neere vpon the time that my
Brother was expected backe againe;
ſhee offered occaſion of ſpeech with
mee to that purpoſe, expreſſely coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
mee to harbour no ſuch opinions
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19405:30"/>
in my fantaſie, and not to frame any
falſe and iniurious tales of her. I that
loued, and honoured her more then
any other thing, and had all the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of nature, and loue from her
to make me doe ſo: gaue her all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances
that ſhee could deſire, of what
ſhee commanded mee, telling her by
way of diſcourſe what I had ſeene here,
which ſo ſatisfied her, ſeeing I had
both ingaged my ſelfe, and had beſides
a little knowledge of the world; as ſhe
promiſed mee, if time gaue her proofe
of the faith I profeſt her, ſhee would
one day ſpeake more freely to me, then
yet ſhe would, as afterward ſhe did,
which ye ſhall heare.</p>
            <p>But firſt ye muſt know, that my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being returned, this practiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them ceaſed, not their loues;
but vertue was of both ſides ſo reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally
obeyed, as their pleaſure, nor
deſire, had not the power to carry
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19405:30"/>
them beyond the limits of reſpect, nor
had they other commerce then by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and thoſe but ſeldome. Not long
after Eaſter, the Marqueſſe hauing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch't
the affaires hee had in charge,
was called home by the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
which ſummons, honour, and
duety both commanded him to obey.
You may imagine, what an affliction
was this eternall ſeparation, both of
them deſpairing euer to ſee one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againe.</p>
            <p>I will onely adde this for one of the
rareſt, and moſt notable examples of
diſcretion, and conſtancy in them both,
that I thinke hath beene euer ſeene vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the like occaſion: that in a feaſt
which the Signory of the towne made
him before his departure, whither the
Ladies were inuited, and among the
reſt my Siſter, whom he led in the <hi>gran
ballo,</hi> or Meaſures, and in whoſe pauſes,
or times of reſt, this ſad ſubiect ſerued
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19405:31"/>
them for entertainement, that neither
there, in taking their leaues, nor here
in this place where hee ſaw her after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(as if it had beene by chance,
comming to bid our Abbeſſe farewell)
none could euer by either of their faces,
or geſtures, perceiue any alteration in
their mindes, or any appearance ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from their accuſtomed faſhion, as
might giue any the leaſt ſuſpition of the
truth. He being gone, and my Siſter big
with child, and drawing neere her time;
ſhe came hither to ſee me, and tooke of
me the greateſt aſſurances ſhe could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uize
of ſecriſie, of what I ſhould receiue
from her. Which I haue hitherto moſt
inuiolably kept; and ſhould ſtill, had
not this occaſion pluct it from mee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, yee, and I owe an equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
vnto her memory, and all other
danger is long ſince paſt. She fpake to
me in this ſort.</p>
            <p>Siſter, you may remember, when my
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19405:31"/>
husband was imployed to <hi>Rome,</hi> wee
had ſpeech together of a conceipt you
had then taken; and I promiſed, ſo you
would haue patience for the preſent, I
would hereafter talke more freely to
you. The occaſion is now come, that
(hauing had many teſtimonies of your
loue, though peraduenture, your youth
might giue cauſe to queſtion your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion)
I ſhall repoſe my ſelfe vpon
the aſſurances, and trialls that I haue
had of your affection in the thing that
more concernes mee then my life; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
my ſelfe, it cannot light into
more faithfull, more fit, or more ſafe
hands then into yours.</p>
            <p>Then ſhe relates to me, the loues of
the Marqueſſe and her, and how the
childe, with which ſhe was then great,
was his, as hee knew, and not my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but becauſe ſhee was not aboue
three weeks gone with child before my
Brothers returne, it was eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19405:32"/>
it. Neuertheleſſe, ſhee deſired the
Marqueſſe ſhould know (as was agreed
betweene them) what iſſue her great
belly ſhould come to: which ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
her ſelfe to doe, if God gaue
her life, but if it pleaſed him by her
death, to depriue her of the meanes,
ſhee deſired me to diſcharge this office,
and to this purpoſe; three dayes after
ſhe ſhould be brought a bed, a Pilgrime
ſhould come, faining to bee returned
from Ieruſalem, bringing images, and
other things of deuotion, and ſhould
aske almes to make his voyage to Saint
<hi>Iaques</hi> in <hi>Spaine:</hi> whom you ſhall find
meanes (ſaid ſhee) to take into your
chamber, and giue him this little cofer,
whereof this is the key: there is in it a
Iewell, his picture, and his letters, at
the bottome of one of which, you ſhall
write a ſonne, or a daughter, according
as I ſhall be deliuered, and you ſhall ſo
diſcharge him, without more words to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19405:32"/>
him. If I die, you ſhall be freed of this
trouble, and ſhall only keepe this boxe,
which ſhe opened, and read his letters
to mee, the beſt written I thinke, that
euer were ſeene; the Iewell was this
Diamond, which you haue ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
and I haue euer promiſed you:
ſhe gaue it mee at her death, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of my Brother to keepe for you
till your Marriage.</p>
            <p>Now you muſt note, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe
was to ſend ſome one of truſt to
<hi>Naples,</hi> about the time of my Siſters
lying in; who clad like a Pilgrime,
ſhould temporize and diſſemble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
for a time, in all but the place,
where hee was certainely to bee found
out, by thoſe hee ſhould bee ſent vnto
from, though he knew them not. God
would that ſoone after his arriuall, ſhe
was deliuered of you, Neece, ſo happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as ſhe had the meanes to ſee him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch't
herſelfe. But ſhe left the cofer
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19405:33"/>
with mee ſtill, which I kept till her
death, ſhee commanded mee to burne
within a while after, all that was within
it (as I did) and gaue me the Iewell (as I
haue told you) the which my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beleeued, ſhe had had of her Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Biſhop of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> when ſhe went
to ſee him on his deathbed, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her being with child of you.</p>
            <p>Behold the trueth of the Hiſtory, to
which I ſweare to you, I haue added
nothing of my owne, but deliuered the
ſimple trueth of all as it paſt; being
one of the ſeldomeſt ſeene, and rareſt
paſſages carried in this kinde, that I
thinke hath beene lightly heard, or
reade of; and by relation, whereof I
hope I ſhall not haue diuerted, or
ſlact either of you in the offices of that
amitie, which the mutuall opinions
of your neere alliance each to other
hath engendered betweene you: and
wherein (though ye may in trueth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouer
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19405:33"/>
the miſtaking of your beleefes
hitherto) yet your vertues, I know will
ſmoothe ouer greater errours, for the
honour of your houſe, and the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of ſo worthy a woman as ſhe was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella</hi> through this diſcourſe, fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to bee much diſpleaſed with her
Aunt, ſaid to her; pardon me (Aunt)
if I bate you a little of the reſpect I bore
you, to the end to giue the cinders of
my dead Mother their due; which
command mee to tell you that I hold
the ſtory you haue told, as repugnant
to trueth, as all thoſe that haue knowne
her, haue euer iudged her actions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
and obedient to vertue. And
you can not more plainely forbid mee
your conuerſation, then by defaming
the honour of one I owe ſo much to as
a Mother.</p>
            <p>No, no Neece, (ſaid the Nunne) I
pray you doe not thinke I haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
any thing to you that is not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19405:34"/>
moſt true, or haue ſpoken at all to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
you, or blemiſh the honour of my
dead Siſter, in the reuerence whereof
(though you be her Daughter) you
ſhall neuer exceed me. 'Twas by chance
I fell into this diſcourſe, and vpon the
occaſion your words gaue me, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that aſſurance that ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
vs, which I imagined too great to
haue ſuffered any ſuch diſtruſts to haue
ſtept betweene vs. The experience
that the world and more yeares may
giue you, will ſhew you, that ſuch, and
ſtranger accidents than theſe, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
impoſſible: Although I muſt
confeſſe, if I had imagined it would
haue ſo much offended you, I had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
my ſelfe from ſpeaking any thing
of this matter.</p>
            <p>I would not Siſter (ſaid <hi>Hipolito</hi>) for
the better halfe of my life but you had
brought me this vnexpected quiet, and
drawne me out of the conflict my ſoule
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19405:34"/>
was in, and rebellion againſt mee, and
my deſtinies againſt all my deareſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
nay, againſt Heauen it ſelfe, for
hauing plunged me into a gulfe of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
ſo deepe, as no other thing but
the remedie this your diſcourſe may
prepare for me, can deliuer me out of.</p>
            <p>Behold (anſwered the Nunne) to
what paſſe I am come; for my owne
part, I hold you both deare, and loue
you with ſo equal an affection, as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make any diſtinction between you,
and hauing at once pleaſed the one, and
offended the other, I am as much affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with that diſtaſt, as glad of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contentment. But had I knowne
the occaſion of theſe contrary motions,
perhaps my ſmall vnderſtanding had
prompted me to haue ſo fitly ſpoken,
that I had remained equally accepted
of you both.</p>
            <p>I pray Aunt (ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi>) let vs leaue
this ill ſubiect; 'tis not onely to you
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19405:35"/>
Neece (ſaid ſhe:) but to me deare God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe
(anſwered <hi>Hipolito</hi>) who propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to my ſelfe from hence all my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
will beleeue that my Siſter is
miraculouſly falne vpon this diſcourſe,
to draw backe my life not from the
graue, but (which is worſe) from the
for-euer languiſhing griefes, whither
the miſchiefe of my deſperate conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was leading me. Then began hee to
diſcourſe anew of his loues, as if he had
not yet imparted them to the Nunne,
who the better to giue the laſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
to this worke, had ſent word
that her Neece was to ſup with her, and
that the Coach ſhould not a wait her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
till the euening. She obſerued
well the Maids countenance during <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito's</hi>
diſcourſe, and beleeued her heart
meant him no ill, though ſhe often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
him, as deſirous they ſhould
beleeue the contrarie: in the end ſhe
enforced her ſelfe to this ſpeech.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:19405:35"/>
Was it not enough that you had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſt
ſo much from what you ought, as
to haue followed the direction of ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
an opinion, and ſo farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
as to haue thus often importuned
mee, but that you muſt now be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
beyond the limits of modeſtie
and your owne honour, in daring to
lay open all this to her, before whom
the leaſt thought of it ſhould make you
bluſh? I beſeech you be ſatisfied with
my patience, and your own impudence,
without going farther.</p>
            <p>The Nunne beleeuing ſhe ſaid this
rather forced then heartily, interrupted
her, ſaying, (Neece) ſcornes doe not
alwaies ſit well vpon modeſt women,
nor ought they to light indifferently
vpon all thoſe that offer them their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice:
The honeſtie, birth, wit, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
good faſhion, with other faire
parts and vertues of ſuch as poſſeſſe
them, ought to commend &amp; make them
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19405:36"/>
more acceptable then others, leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
accompliſh't; and ſhee that
ſhould not make this difference, muſt
deſerue to be thought without iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or vnderſtanding. You are not of
that number; and the eſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of your friendſhip with my
Brother, ſhewes in what ranke you
hold him. And now that you haue
occaſion to iudge his, to you greater
then euer, and more compleat, ſince his
parts heretofore made you eſteeme him
worthy your fauour, why muſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
and perfection of his loue be the
diminution and end of yours? reſtore
your ſelfe to your ſelfe, and doe not a
thing ſo vnlike you; doe not (ſweet
Neece) make him miſerable, whom you
haue euer knowne honeſt and worthy
of loue, nor pay the debt of the faithfull
ſeruice he hath vowed to you, with a
leſſe fauourable vſage then you were
content to allow him when you owed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19405:36"/>
him leſſe. <hi>Iſabella,</hi> though ſhe made ſhew
that theſe diſcourſes diſpleaſed her, and
that ſhe beleeu'd the tale of her Mothers
loues to be but a cunning impoſture of
her Aunts, to draw her to her Brothers
deſires, neuertheleſſe this ſerued for the
firſt excuſe of their loues, and to cleare
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe difficulties which till now
had diuided them; for in the end, led
by her deſtinies, woone by her Aunts
perſwaſions, with the oaths and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
ſhe gaue her of the truth of her
relation, and by the teares and coniura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Hipolito,</hi> but chiefly by the force
of loue, ſhe yeelded her ſelfe wholly to
his power: for alas, how can a ſilly
Maid maintaine her libertie againſt him
who ſubdues all whom he will, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
when he will to his yoke and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</p>
            <p>At laſt then, after ſuch ceremonies as
likely paſſe in things of this kinde, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>
is receiued by <hi>Iſabella</hi> for her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19405:37"/>
with ſuch contentment as onely
thoſe may imagine who haue incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the like happie ſucceſſes, but with
condition that his loue ſhould be ſtill
confined within thoſe diſcreet limits he
had before offered, without forcing her
permiſſion farther then her lookes and
ſpeech ſhould giue him cauſe to hope.
Theſe are leaues with which many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the workings of their loues, to giue
the more gloſſe to the colours of their
intentions. But hee willingly receiues
that law which inables him to make a
greater, and he who deſires to haue a
victorie, imbraces it vpon any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
vnder the hope, that being once
maſter, his obedience lies in his owne
hands. All this poore Maid could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
was ſworne and promiſed by her
Vncle, with all the aſſurances could be
giuen. So hauing ſupt, and the Coach
being come, they tooke their leaues of
the Nunne, with many thankes for the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19405:37"/>
eaſie meane ſhe had giuen them to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
their contentment, promiſing
each to other an often meeting in that
or other alike conuenient place. Some
happie daies they enioyed to the full of
their wiſhes, but as all things are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to mutabilitie; ſo neither could
this happineſſe long ſubſiſt, without
ſome feeling of the inconſtancie of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabritio</hi> preſſeth his Daughter to
her marriage, beleeuing her Vncle his
Brother no ſmal part of the cauſe of the
coldneſſe of her inclination to it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he reſolues to ſend him to <hi>Padua,</hi>
to confirme thoſe noble parts his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
had begun in him, and tells him
this his reſolution; laying before him
his youth, and how much it was yet
too early to retire himſelfe, and put an
end to ſo faire beginnings, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooued
him to goe yet further to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the vulgar; that his fortune was
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19405:38"/>
to be built vpon extraordinary merits,
ſince his owne meanes were not great;
and that onely for ſo good purpoſes he
ſhould make vſe of him, as of one that
euer would reckon him one of his; and
that though at <hi>Naples</hi> there was no
want of honeſt exerciſes, yet they had
not letters, the chiefe ornament and
perfection of a Gentleman: beſides,
that, the place of our birth is neuer ſo
fit for our education as another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hipolito</hi> ſurpriſed with this vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
newes, was vnprouided of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
yet neither accepteth nor refuſeth
it, but found ſome pretence to delay the
time for a few daies. In the end, his
dutie, his honour, his reaſon, and the
reuerence hee bore his Brother made
him conſent; but his deſire, his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
his loue and contentment contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it:
amid theſe doubts he went to
aduiſe with his Siſter the Nunne, where
hauing long waied all theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19405:38"/>
and finding that the reſpect and
honour of his Miſtreſſe, was too ſtrong
for any other argument for his ſtay,
and the many accidents that might
croſſe their contentments being to be
feared; beſides, that his Brother the
Notarie, of whom he depended, and
who began a little to ſuſpect this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
had abſolutely told him, that if
he would euer hope for any thing from
him, he was out of hand to obey the
appointment of their elder Brother,
which was for his good and aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that if he voluntarily reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the well wiſhes of his friends, he
ſhould finde himſelfe abandoned of
them, and of all the hope of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
The Nunne (on the other ſide)
perſwaded him, that the yeelding to his
Brothers, beſides that it might be to
him a ſtep to his better fortune, would
be a no leſſe principall ſafety for the
communication of his, and his Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19405:39"/>
deſires, it being hard and almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that the firſt hear of their loues
could be ſo cunningly couered, but that
ſome flames would be perceiued, that it
was not for him to hope to interrupt
her marriage, and though he could, yet
that he ſhould rather helpe it forward
as the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>teſt meane to eſtabliſh their
happineſſe, gaining thereby the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ſee, haunt and communicate each
with other, with all the priuacie they
could deſire; that it was to be feared
that time might open the eies of Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<hi>Fabritio,</hi> and his Wife, to ſee more
then they would they ſhould, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this marriage theſe feares would
ceaſe, their actions being no more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to ſo much ouer-looking, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition
of the occaſion of thoſe hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
being taken away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hipolito</hi> at length concluded vpon
his iourney to <hi>Padua,</hi> and that a while
after <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſhould conſent to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19405:39"/>
without ſhowing any greater
eaſineſſe then before; to remooue all
ſurmize of her Vncles being any cauſe
of her former backwardneſſe: without
ſtaying then till <hi>Fabritio</hi> ſhould preſſe
him againe, his Brother of himſelfe,
vrges him for the meanes to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
his will, promiſing him ſo well to
employ his time and expence, as ſhould
giue him contentment; this <hi>Fabritio,</hi>
receiues gladly.</p>
            <p>The day before his departure, hee
met his <hi>Iſabella</hi> at the Nunnery; there
did their approaching ſeparation, giue
all paſſage of both ſides to thoſe griefes,
teares, and ſad complaints, that the
violence of a mutuall Loue paſſion,
might raiſe in the young heate of theſe
Louers affection; there was Fortune
hewen, and their Deſtinies accuſed of
too exceſſiue a cruelty, for bringing on
them ſo ſudden a night of parting, euen
in the morning of their warme affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19405:40"/>
After that, their Eyes, Voyces,
Lips, and Armes, had done their
mutuall offices, and that the Nunne
had comforted them, with the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of her continuall aſſiſtance; they
confirmed againe the promiſes of their
Loues, with the ſtrong pledges, of
all the ſolemneſt Oathes they could
deuize, inuoking all the execrations,
and miſeries that Heauen, and Hell
could lay vpon either of them that
ſhould faile in the leaſt point, with
proteſtation, that what euer other vow
they ſhould make repugnant to theſe
(which againe, and againe, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated)
ſhould not bee by voluntary
conſent, but forced, and conſtrained:
and thereupon went and heard Maſſe
together.</p>
            <p>To the end, to write with more ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
each to other, they reſolued <hi>Hipolito</hi>
ſhould incloſe his letters, within thoſe
hee ſhould write to the Nunne, who
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19405:40"/>
ſhould giue them to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
him againe their anſwere. They
coniured one another alſo, to beare the
anguiſh of their abſence with patience,
and ſo to command themſelues at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
as no appearance of either ſide,
ſhould breed any ſuſpition of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
which they did fitly enough;
for <hi>Hipolito</hi> found meanes to ſpeake to
his Brothers, and take leaue of them,
and his Siſters in the abſence of his
Neece, whom afterward hee met, as by
chance going to her Chamber, and
there took his leaue of her with little
ſtay. Shee tooke onely leaſure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
him, that ſhee might ſee him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her marriage, which ſhe promiſed
to ſend him word of.</p>
            <p>Hee was no ſooner at <hi>Padua,</hi> which
was in September, but hee cauſed to

commoditie to ſteale his iourney
without being diſcouered. He went
diſguized during the Chriſtmas holy-dayes,
and by bywayes got to <hi>Naples,</hi>
where hee arriued late in the euening,
and without being knowne to any one,
found the way the next morning to the

left them alone in her Cabinet, two or

            <p>A little after Twelfe day, becauſe

This alteration (apparant ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

of a malitious nature, to doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury

that had already disfigured her face,
with a hundred foultes and wrincles,
forbad all beholders not onely the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,

the Childe is the ſigne of Virginitie

a wound; and <hi>Diomedes</hi> his ſlipper,

the paſt ill life of this old woman, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
viſible in that crooked diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>Examples doe teach vs, that it hath
euer beene an infamous, and diſhoneſt
faſhion, to blot and deſtroy the credite

vntimely (and often moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly)
the ſorrowes, and furies of ſuch
as apprehend themſelues iniured. As
the Carpenters that had the charge of
the <hi>Deliak</hi> Galley, haue (by ſupplying,
or lining ſtill the rotten and decayed
ribbes, with new pieces of wood, kept
it ſound and entire ſince the time it was

with this Reputation, and it is no more
hard to mainteine, and hold vp a good

keeping ſtill vnder it ſomewhat to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and preſerue it aliue; but when
once fury, and malice haue vtterly
quench't, and kild it, there is then no
more hope left of recouering the one,
then renewing the other, when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is ſpent; yet ſuch is the peruerſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the age we liue in, and ſo many
ill inclinations there are, as for a little
profit, or pleaſure, they care not to ſee
all things in combuſtion, and as a field
full of weedes, ſo is the world in euery
corner, full of vngratefull, and diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

            <p>The wiſe therefore ought to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect,
and as miſchiefes are like to

of their reputations.</p>
            <p>

The wiſe (ſaid the wiſe man) receiue

to practiſe this art and ſcience.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Satyr</hi> preſſing to imbrace and

wipe the beard off thy chinne; for it
burnes being touch't, it giues (beſides)
warmthe, and light, and is our moſt

but ſuch as are deſcreete and prudent,
can turne to their owne profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage,

            <p>To wit, in this time, that this Vncle

had from the olde womans report)
growes from that time vigilant and
watchfull ouer them. Hee vſes meanes
that <hi>Iſabella</hi> is ſent for, who ſoone after

both of them reſoluing to honour this
olde Gentleman, as they did. After
their greetings, <hi>Iſabella</hi> gaue him a faire

And as one of that age and Nation,
being once rouch't with a ſuſpition,
yeeldes himſelfe eaſie to perſeuer in it,

yet the inſufficiency that hee knew in

his wife and him, made him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the honeſt priuacies betweene her
and her Vncle, although they ſtretch't

He reſolues before his departure to put
a man to his Nephew to waite on him
in his Chamber, that had beene of his

with all ſuch inſtructions as he thought
the fitteſt to bring him to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

            <p>This Chamberlaine is willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued

for that Centinell and Watchman

the deſerts of a good and kinde vſage.
<hi>Hipolito</hi> of the other ſide, let paſſe no

            <p>So hurtfull often times is our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

This Chamberlaine ſeconded with
the old woman, (to whom the Knight
had alſo declared his intention) had
within a moneth or two, at certaine
times of <hi>Hipolito's</hi> repaire to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
houſe, perceiued ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, which hee foorthwith
acquainted the Knight withall. Who
thereupon goes to <hi>Naples,</hi> where (like
enough by his meanes) there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſome whiſpering rumour ſpread
about of this newes; and where no
ſooner arriued, but without any word
to his Brother <hi>Fabritio,</hi> or his Wife
<hi>Liuia,</hi> of what led him thither; hee
goes to the Notary; who was <hi>Hipoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's</hi>
chiefe refuge, and tells him, that if
his Brother out of hand refrained not
his diſhoneſt frequentation with his
Neece, hee was in danger ere long to
ſmart for it, adding how much they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
the aduantage of their neere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance;
and that hee had not beleeued
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19405:57"/>
the firſt report of the vnlawfull priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that had long beene betweene
them, but now was ſo vndoubtedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
thereof, as hee could no longer
be ignorant, or conceale them: and that
(ſaue for the reſpect and honour of
their houſe) he had ere then, taken ſuch
reuenge as had befitted ſuch a forfaite:
how hee had reuealed it to none but
himſelfe onely, as one who beſt, and
with leaſt ſcandall might ſtop the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
of the buſineſſe, and bury it: and
whoſe wiſedome hee knew of abilitie,
for ſo diſcreete a conduct, and as the
conſequence of the affaire required. All
the allegations that the Notary could
make to the contrary of this Knights
opinion, and to poſſeſſe him with other
beliefe of his Brother and Neece, and
how there was nothing, that could be
iudged more licentious betweene them,
then their neere alliance permitted, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:19405:58"/>
In concluſion, he intreated him that
he might know no more ſuch faſhions
in his Brother, leaſt he found his courſe
more roughly interrupted then hee
looked for.</p>
            <p>This Notary miſtruſted nothing of
the trueth the Knight had told him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelfe a man that vſed not to
condemne any kinde of this vice, and
beſides, had before (as granted)
warned his Brother to bee wary in the
menage of his affaires, aduertiſing him
how hard a matter it was for him, long
to conceale them, if hee once gaue ouer
their conduct, wholly to the libertie of
his affections. Soone after (then) hee
tells him what the Knight had diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
whereupon he refrained from vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting
his Neece as before, ſaue by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which yet were frequent, and gaue
her often newes of him. She on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide (to whom writing was not
ſufficient) being of a nature apt enough
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19405:58"/>
to expoſe to all dangers, her Fortune,
and Life, to giue the greater proofe of
her affection, to whom ſhe had vowed
it; and condemning all artifice of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation,
and euen diſcretion, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from a minde, too free within
it ſelfe, and exempt from paſſion; full
of vnreſt, could not containe her ſelfe,
from diſcouering the alteration in her
thoughts, but yeelded to rage, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſure
(vpon all occaſions) againſt
this old woman, and often againſt her
new man, of whom ſhee was now
growne diſtruſtfull.</p>
            <p>Being aduertized by <hi>Hipolito,</hi> of an
intention hee had to accompany the
Prince of <hi>Luſignan</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> her quicke
inuention, ſupplied her readily, with a
colourable occaſion to goe to <hi>Naples,</hi>
and ſuch as her Husband was moſt
willing with, there ſhee learned more
particularly, all what this Knight had
told the Notary, by the aduice of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19405:59"/>
whom, and of the Nunne, <hi>Hipolito</hi> goes
to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſabella's</hi> iourney was not approued
of by the Knight her Vncle; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in him, and in others, the doubt
into which he was entred of this Loue,
and in her Mother alſo, who thought
much more of it then ſhe ſpake.</p>
            <p>During <hi>Hipolito's</hi> abode at <hi>Rome,</hi> the
old Woman, and the Chamberlaine,
had but few pleaſant houres, but
ſtill ſhee found ſomewhat or other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
in their actions: ſo as one day,
this old carcaſe told her, that for being
too true a ſeruant to her Maiſter, her
Lady lou'd her not; and that if ſhee
could haue ſeene and ſaid nothing, ſhe
had liued a quieter life. This came to
the Husbands eares; who ſounding
not the bottome of it, paſt it ouer.</p>
            <p>The Chamberlaine was more ſubtile,
for though hee could heare it ſaid, that
they were worthy of hate, that could
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19405:59"/>
indure to ſerue in a place, where they
were knowne to be onely ſet to doe baſe
offices; and ſerue for candles, to light
ſtrangers into all the baſeneſſe of the
houſe, with much more to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
yet, hee ſtopt eare and mouth, to
all, and ſeeming to vnderſtand nothing
of it, made likewiſe no anſwere to
any thing.</p>
            <p>The Knight who had beene ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of al things, came againe to his
Nephew: where freely hee told his
Neece, of his diſcontent at her faſhion
of life, intreating her to change it, or
that elſe hee was to make the World
know, how vnworthy ſhe was, to hold
the honour of ſuch a houſe and alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
All her well couch't and probable
ſpeeches (which the many angry teares
of her great heart, would not of a long
time giue paſſage to) did no whit abate
the obſtinacy of this Vncle; who at
length, more ſweetning his ſpeech, then
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19405:60"/>
altering his opinion; told her, that to
make her innocence appeare, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue
all miſdoubts (ſince things were
already come to ſo ill a paſſe) ſhe was by
a change of life to remooue their c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uſe;
and that to this, there wanted but her
will, by the reſolution whereof, ſhee
might alwayes make her ſelfe appeare,
ſuch as ſhee deſired the World ſhould
iudge her. After hauing well thought
of what courſe was fitteſt for her to
take, ſhee had recourſe to the inforced
remedy of diſſimulation; Shee ſpake
not ſo much of her Vncle as before, nor
ſo often commended his actions, nor
curiouſly enquired after him, yet ſhee
often heard newes of him, though not
ſo ſecreetly, but ſtill this Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine
perceiued, and tooke notice of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
meſſages to his Lady, which his
Maiſter had no word of; ſhee ſhewed

ſhew her purpoſe of confining her

houſe, and attend onely to the care of
her domeſticke affaires, ſhee tooke the
charge of them vpon her, with ſo fit
and dextrous a management, that one
would haue thought, ſhee had buſied
the ſtudy of her whole life in them.
Shee cauſed to be made her a Cabinet,
or ſtudy, with the entry into it of her
garderobe, or inner Chamber, and a
paſſage out into the Garden of the

            <p>From the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> till
about the end of <hi>October,</hi> this faſhon
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19405:63"/>
held betweene them: But alas, the
night hath eyes, and trueth is ſeene in
the darke. 'Tis knowne <hi>Hipolito</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceales
himſelfe in this houſe. <hi>Pompeio's</hi>
Vncle that had vnderſtood all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of his former iourney, knowes this
laſt deceit too, but not the conueiance
of the Cabinet. Hee growes more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
then euer; goes to his Neece,
taunts her with all the ſharpeſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
hee had, threatning her and her
<hi>Hipolito,</hi> with no leſſe then an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
death: tells all to the Husband,
reproaching him for his little ſence of
this iniury, and his want of courage to
reuenge it.</p>
            <p>And hauing ſufficiently plaide his
part there, goes foorthwith to <hi>Naples,</hi>
and does there alſo the like, diſcouering
all to <hi>Fabritio</hi> and his wife, from point
to point, how euery particular had
paſt, the warnings hee had giuen, and
intreaties hee had made to them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19405:64"/>
from their courſe: then inueyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Notary, who denies his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
being at his houſe (at leaſt to his
knowledge, himſelfe being then at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples)
Hipolito,</hi> was foorthwith aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
of this, to the end hee might
not bee found there; but becauſe thoſe
of the houſe, could not ſo readily be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
(ſome woman and a childe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that hee had beene there, and
was but two dayes before gone from
thence) this made all the reſt credible, &amp;
after all the bitterneſſe that the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of ſuch an affaire could put into
his words, and that hee had therewith
bound his two brothers by their oathes
not to receiue <hi>Hipolito,</hi> this Vncle left
them; reſoluing to vſe all meanes to
ſurprize him.</p>
            <p>Thus, this poore miſerable Louer,
beaten with ſo many tempeſts, left of
his chiefeſt friends, abandoned of all
hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> findes (though too late) how
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19405:64"/>
ſlippery is the downe-fall of our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and how great the diſproportion
is of the ſhort contentments, and long
miſeries of this life.</p>
            <p>Hee retire himſelfe to his Brother
<hi>Scipio's</hi> houſe, who was married ſome
twelue miles from <hi>Naples,</hi> in the way
to <hi>Suca.</hi> There he remained ſome daies,
and after hauing reſted his wits diuerſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſtracted, and ouerwrought with
the conſideration of the extremitie hee
was in, and what courſe was fitteſt to
be taken, hee reſolued by the aduice of
his Brother (a man more ſubtile in
vice, then ingenious in vertuous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
to cauſe diſperſed abroad, a rumor
that hee was ſlaine, hoping by this
meane to drowne al noiſe already ſpread
of matters paſt, and lay a certaine
ground whereon to build the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
for the contentment of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
and himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Before he began to put this in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19405:65"/>
he ſent her a Tablet full of ſtances
written vpon the ſubiect of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
couered with Gold, ſowen full of
Thornes to the life in Inameled worke,
and in the middeſt of either face was a
Tombe of blacke Amell, and on the
top of it a Semperuiue to the life, and at
the foote written, <hi>Del piacer Sepolto la

Soone as <hi>Hipolito</hi> was ſure his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
had receiued his letters, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to play his fained <hi>Tragedy,</hi> certaine
people are ſet on, who come betimes in
the morning to his Brothers lodging,
telling him that there was a man ſlaine,
that night in the next Village, vpon the
way to his houſe, with the Horſe hee
rode on, and it ſhould ſeeme was his
younger Brother. He riſes haſtily, and
goes to the place whither theſe people
led him, where hee found a thing truſt
vp in forme of a man, which hee had
cauſed to be ſtuft with haye, and dreſt
vp in a ſute, his Brother had ſometime
worne, cut and mangled in diuerſe
places, reſembling blowes, and thruſts
with ſwords, and all beſmeared with
blood, and his Horſe alſo dead by him.
He takes a Notary of the Village, and a
Prieſt for his purpoſe, and in preſence
of thoſe that conducted him thither,
and ſome other of his owne people,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19405:66"/>
cauſed to bee made a verball proceſſe,
how his Brother <hi>Hipolito</hi> had beene by
them found in that place, newly ſlaine
with ſo many hurts, in ſuch places, clad
in ſuch a ſute, his Horſe likewiſe dead,
beſide him: and inſtantly, omitting
nothing that might make all credible,
cauſed that bundle, or falſe man to bee
buried as if it had beene the body of
<hi>Hipolito,</hi> in the Church of that Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage;
puts himſelfe into blackes, and
ſends foorthwith, the verball pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe
to <hi>Naples</hi> to his Brothers; ere
long, the death of <hi>Hipolito</hi> was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
bruted about, and came to the
cares of <hi>Pompeio</hi> and his wife, who
faining to beleeue it, (and the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
beleeuing) ſeemed much to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it.</p>
            <p>The Winter was at that time well
ſpent, when <hi>Hipolito</hi> hauing executed
this ſtratagem, gets him diſguiſed all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
on foote, by night, by vnuſed by
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19405:67"/>
wayes to the Parke of <hi>Pompeio's</hi> houſe,
and lodges in his Miſtreſſes Cabinet,
where hee was two dayes, there they
conſulted of what was to bee done, for
their deliuery out of thraldome.</p>
            <p>It was concluded then, that they
muſt reſolue for <hi>Cypres,</hi> or <hi>Candy,</hi> and
that, to that effect, he would prouide a
Barke, and lay it ready victualled, and
furniſh't of all things fit, againſt the
end of <hi>March,</hi> or beginning of <hi>April</hi>
next. For this purpoſe ſhee gaue him
ſuch monies as ſhe had, reſoluing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
to employ her vttermoſt indeauour,
to get together the moſt ſhee could, to
make their voyage, and maintaine them
after. In the meane time, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
he was to viſite her, with the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
and ſecreteſt meanes hee could,
hauing prouided himſelfe, of ſome ſafe
retraite for himſelfe not farre of.</p>
            <p>Being gone, ſhee aduiſed with her
ſelfe, to perſwade her Husband to make
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19405:67"/>
a voyage into <hi>France,</hi> the peace being
made betweene the Kings of <hi>France,</hi>
and <hi>Naples.</hi> Shee wanted no faire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
to vrge him with; how it
was a ſhame for one of his age, &amp; place
in the world, to haue neuer ſeene other,
then the angle hee was borne in: that
this voyage would faſhion, and make
him vp better; and yeeld him more
knowne, and honoured of the beſt and
Nobleſt company: that hee had not
yet gained that eſteeme in the World,
that hee might enable himſelfe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
by more inriching his minde,
with experience to iudge, and abilitie
to diſcourſe, in which, an infinite of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
out went him, and were therefore
preferred, and reſpected before him:
which both in birth and meanes, and
all other things, were farre to yeeld to
him: and how though his preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
in poſſeſſion yeelded him not
much, ſhee would finde him enough,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19405:68"/>
without much preiudicing it, for that
effect: that his lands were well timbred,
ſo as the ſale of foure, or fiue thouſand
crownes worth, would not bee much
miſt: that they would leaſe out part of
their lands, and make that way as much
more money in incummes: and that
with ſuch a like ſumme, he might make
his voyage, with credit and honour:
how for her part, ſhee would keepe
but her maides, and one man, and
to auoid expence, would retire her
ſelfe to <hi>Naples</hi> to her Mother, who
ſhee knew would thinke her company
no trouble.</p>
            <p>She gildes her language ſo well, that
her Husband beginnes to reliſh the
motion, and goes to his Vncle and
guardian, and communicates it to him:
who likes well enough of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
and giues the charge to <hi>Iſabella,</hi>
to finde Merchants, and make the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with them, ſaying, he would au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19405:68"/>
her, becauſe her Husband was
yet in his minoritie.</p>
            <p>You may imagine whither ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred
her ſelfe or no, or <hi>Hipolito</hi> of the
other ſide, who (hauing prouided a
Barke, Rigged, Victualled, and furniſh't
with all things neceſſary to make the
voyage into <hi>Cypres,</hi> vpon the firſt day
of <hi>April</hi>) goes confidently about with
his Lacquey diſguiſed, like Venetian
Merchants, coaſting the Countrey, to
looke out ſome place of retreite for
himſelfe neere his Miſtreſſes houſe;
and as there is no difficultie, but money
paſſes through it, hee gaines by that
baite, a Countrey fellow that dwelt in a
little houſe, by a Woodes ſide; farre
enough from neighbours, and onely
three miles off from his Miſtreſſe; where
he remained till the periode of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
faining himſelfe fled out of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
for certaine debts, and that during
his abſence, his friendes were labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19405:69"/>
ſome reaſonable compoſition for
him, with his Creditors, his poore
Hoſte, for the profit hee receiued by
him, could haue wiſh't him ſtill in buſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe:
hauing expreſſely forbidden
thoſe of his houſe, not to diſcouer him
to any one, ſerued him with all things
for himſelfe, and his Horſes.</p>
            <p>When hee went by night to ſee his
Miſtreſſe (which was often) hee made
his Hoſt beleeue, that it was either to
ſpeake with ſome that negotiated for
him, or to deliuer, or to receiue letters
at a place they were ſtill by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
left.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, <hi>Iſabella</hi> of her
part was not idle, for hauing bargained
for fiue thouſand crownes worth of
timber, with Merchants that had the
money ready at an houres warning,
and leaſed out a great part of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
lands for certaine yeeres, for the
receipt of fiue thouſand more, ſhee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertized
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19405:69"/>
the Knight her Vncle of it,
and intreates of him to come the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>March,</hi> to ſee the couenants
diſpatch't for his Nephew, her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
at his houſe: whither hee came
the ſeuenteenth day to dinner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hipolito,</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
(this money being receiued, and
lock't vp in her Cabinet, which they
made account, would be at the furtheſt
by the twentieth day) to depart the
night following, vpon <hi>Hipolitos</hi> Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
hee carrying his Miſtreſſe behinde
him; and his man, and her maide vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another Horſe, all laden with as
much as they could carry in Money,
and Iewels, and gaine that night the
Port <hi>Gaietta,</hi> and ſtraight hoiſe vp the
ſailes of the Barke that lay ready for
them, accomodated at all points, as
well with Linnen, Cloathes, Bookes,
as all other neceſſary mooueables.</p>
            <p>The Knights two ſpies had ſo well
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19405:70"/>
watch't ouer the vnfortunate <hi>Iſabella,</hi>
that they had heard ſome one walking
and talking in the night with her, in
her Cabinet, who they knew were none
of her women, hauing found them
both a ſleepe in her gardrobe: beſides,
had further diſcouered, that <hi>Iulia</hi> did
often times conuey meate, and wine
thither, without telling for whom:
and at three or foure ſeuerall times,
that it had rained in the night, they
had tract the footing of ſome perſon,
going and comming through the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
to the ſtaire of the Cabinet, and
thence to the Parke gate, and the entrie
thereof beaten with the footing of a
Horſe.</p>
            <p>All this is told to the Knight,
ſoone after his arriuall, who without
ſeeming to haue knowne any thing
new, paſſes the reſt of the day in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe
of his Nephewes voyage; of
the traine he ſhould carry with him, of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19405:70"/>
the gouernment of his expences; and
time of his ſtay abroad, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</p>
            <p>The night being come, hee ſent one
of his men to watch without the Parke
gate, which was faſtned onely, but that
of the Garden lock't euery night, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
him to conceale himſelfe all
hee could, and ſpeake to no man of it,
and if hee ſaw any one come in that
way, to bring him preſent word. That
night there appeared nothing; the
next morning betimes, the Marchants
come, the couenants are paſt, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch't,
the laſt monies receiued and
lock't into <hi>Iſabella's</hi> Cabinet, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough for her to aduertiſe <hi>Hipolito</hi>
of it, by that meane they vſed to heare
from one another thoſe daies they met
not, which was by leauing their letters
in a hollow tree in the Parke, where
they fetch't, or ſent for them at a fit
houre. <hi>Hipolito</hi> ſent his man thither
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19405:71"/>
that night at Supper time, who found
a little note, containing the aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all.</p>
            <p>The night comming, the Knight
ſends his man againe as before. Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
and miſchiefe intentiue to the
ruine of theſe vnhappy louers, and
meaning to ſet them for paternes to
ſhew how little auailes mans foreſight,
to withſtand the Heauens appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that when we hold the end
of our hopes neereſt, and moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
'tis then commonly, that we feele
the euents fartheſt off, and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to our expectations: This miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
(I ſay) would that <hi>Hipolito,</hi>
who now prefumed all things ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
laid, as there wanted nothing but
to goe to take his <hi>Iſabella,</hi> (and whom
the long expectance of this ſo deſired
houre, had made vtterly impatient of
any longer ſtay) came his accuſtomed
way, at nine of the clocke at night, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19405:71"/>
left his man, and Horſes in the
Parke.</p>
            <p>The Knights man hauing diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them, comes to his Maſter vndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouered
by any, tells him what hee
had ſeene; hee ſends him with two
more of his men with Piſtolls to make
good the Parke gate, and ſtay by force
ſuch as were gone in, or ſhoote them if
they preſt out, they found meanes to
get out vndiſcouered before the gates
of the houſe were ſhut in.</p>
            <p>The Knight went to bed, ſo did his
Nephew ſoone after, and was as ſoone
a ſleepe; when he knew his men gone,
this Knight riſes, and ſends a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of his, whom hee kept with him,
for his Nephewes man, him hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
to watch and bring him word,
when his Neeces maides ſhould bee
gone out into her inner Chamber;
which hauing done, he ſends this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of his, commanding him with
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19405:72"/>
a ſword drawne to keepe the women
vpon their liues, from ſtirring out of
the roome they were in, or making any
noiſe, or exclamation, till they were
ſent for out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iulia</hi> was within, with her Miſtreſſe
in her Cabinet. In the meane time,
plants himſelfe at the doore of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet,
liſtning what was done there,
hee could heare ſpeaking, but not the
words, opening and ſhutting of cofers,
remouing of monies, and other things;
at length, after a whiles ſtay, being
neere eleuen of the clocke, hee heard <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
comming to the doore ſaying: I will
goe ſee then Madam, if all the houſe be
a ſleepe, and take theſe purſes that I
haue: and her Miſtreſſe anſwering her,
ſtay not then, for 'tis time wee were
gone; thereupon, the maide halfe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

that preſſes to enter in, which ſhee
ſtroue againſt, and during their conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:19405:72"/>
               <hi>Hipolito</hi> ſaues himſelfe by the
ſtaires into the garden, thinking that he
not being taken, his Miſtreſſe ſhould
runne no hazard: yet hee could not
ſhift himſelfe away ſo ſodainely, but
the Knight hauing borne ope the dore,
might perceiue him ſhutting the other
after him.</p>
            <p>His Nephewes man, that he had put
to him, entred the Cabinet with him;
as ſoone as <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſaw that fellow, ſhe
could not hold from flying furiouſly at
his face, with ſuch iniuries, as witneſt
the beliefe ſhe had of being diſcouered
by him.</p>
            <p>The Kinght ſends him to wake, and
bring his Maiſter, and ſends a man
hee had there of his owne in the next
roome, along with <hi>Iulia,</hi> into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
himſelfe lay in, to the end, to gaine
the trueth out of her, more eaſily by
this ſeparation.</p>
            <p>Nature then ſhewed ſufficiently in

this poore Lady, how ſhee pleaſes her

how farre differing a ſoule from the

often found in that ſexe: and how a
reſolution hauing once taken ſure foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

firme, and immooueable, then in men;
ſhe then, in this croſſe and vnexpected
accident, inſtead of hauing recourſe to

at ſuch an houre with that money,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19405:73"/>
which was part put vp into bagges and
ſackes, and part ſpread vpon the table,
ſhee without ſhew of amazement, told
him, that it was the faſhion of a poore
ſoul'd man, to ſpeake to a woman with

            <p>The Husband being come, was not

thence, hee and his Nephew goes into
the Chamber where <hi>Iulia</hi> was, where
they were ſcarce entred, when ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of the baſe condition of a low

practiſes and intent, which ſhee
made, and was foorthwith brought

how the matter went, and forceing to
riſe vp, ſaid; Ah falſe treacher, why
am I not ſuffered yet before I die, to
puniſh thy deteſtable diſloyaltie?</p>
            <p>They made this maide, auouch to
her all ſhe had told them.</p>
            <p>They ranſack't her cofers, which
were all open; in one of them, they
found all the letters <hi>Hipolito</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to her, bound vp by themſelues;
they found in another, her Iewels ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
together; and not farre off, two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
little boxes of <hi>Mercury ſublimate,</hi>
and other poiſons made into Pilles; in
the vpper part of one of the Cheſts,
they found laide in a place apparant

Euidence, written with her hand.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Know that the precipitation of your
iudgements is ſo ſuddaine, ſo mooued
with paſsion, and waying to the worſer
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:19405:75"/>
part; as that my departure ſhall bee no
ſooner knowne, then blamed of you; and
my ſelfe condemned as an inceſtuous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultereſſe,
in leauing one, who is held to
bee my Husband, to goe away with him,
that is reputed my Vncle.</p>
                  <p>But I beſeech all thoſe, before whoſe
eyes this Euidence ſhall come, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
patience to read it, they will rather
ſettle their opinions vpon the certaine
aſſurance of the trueth they finde in it,
then vpon the falſe appearance of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
errour. 'Tis an exceeding great
griefe to me, that in defence of my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
I muſt diſcouer both my fault, and
my ſhame, and inhumanly breake open
the Sepulchre, and diſeaſe the bones of
the dead, taint the honour, and blemiſh
the memory of her that brought me into
the World: But ſince I haue onely this
meane, whereby to waſh off the ſtaine of
my reputation, I beſeech her Ghoſt to
pardon mee, and both God and men not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19405:75"/>
to impute to impietie, and ingratitude,
what I am compelled vnto, through ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie,
and for my iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>It is knowne, and I haue learned, that
the Lawes doe ſay, that onely the conſent
makes the Marriage; which conſent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
proceede but from a voluntary and
free will, and exempt from all force, and
conſtraint, the which being vſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
forbids what ariſes thence, to bee
called a conſent of the will; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
barres all poſsibilitie of eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
a Marriage vpon the contrary of
that whence onely it ought neceſſarily
to come.</p>
                  <p>There is not any one that hath beene
practiſed with any frequency in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of our houſe, but muſt needes know,
what artifices, ſubtilities, what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and force, what threatnings and ill
vſages, my Father (or hee whom I did
eſteeme for ſuch) and thoſe of whom I
depended, haue vſed towards mee, to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19405:76"/>
make mee condeſcend to the Marriage
with Signior <hi>Pompeio;</hi> their force and
conſtraint, had the power to make mee
his Concubine, not his wife; my will
contracting it, and the abilitie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming
ſo, being taken from mee, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
promiſed, and giuen my ſelfe before
for wife to <hi>Hipolito.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſince the Lawes permit ſuch as
enter into any Religion by force, who
both doe, and ſweare the obligation of
thoſe vſuall vowes; ſince the Lawes (I
ſay) doe giue them, the abilitie to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence
with thoſe, and giue ouer their
orders; why ſhall not Marriage haue
the like power, whereof the promiſes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
binde thoſe more ſtrictly who make
them to men, then the vowes of Religion
doe thoſe that ſweare them to God? I
am not ignorant, that the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
euery one hath, that <hi>Hipolito</hi> as
Brother to my Father, and therefore my
Vncle does thereby conclude my Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19405:76"/>
with him vnlawfull: But it is not
ſo long ſince, but I may entreate ſome
yet of this age to remember, that about
eighteene, or twentie yeeres ſince, the
King ſent to <hi>Naples</hi> the Marqueſſe of
<hi>Coria,</hi> a Spaniard, who ſtayed there ſome
time, during which, he made loue to my
Mother, and gained ſuch intereſt in her,
as that during the abſence of Signior
<hi>Fabritio</hi> her Husband, in a Voyage hee
made to his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> his affection had
arriued to what the affections of men
doe vſually pretend. For in this time I
was begotten: I call God to witneſſe of
my wordes, and that I ſpeake a perfect
trueth. My Mothers Nurſe, and her
Siſter in Law the Nunne, are yet both
liuing, who are neither of them igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
hereof.</p>
                  <p>But to alledge a proofe, that may at all
times bee produced, I aſſure my ſelfe,
there may bee found among the Regiſters
of the Towne-Treazor, the day of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19405:77"/>
departure of Signior <hi>Fabritio</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and of his returne to <hi>Naples;</hi> and by
his charges, and their diſcharge in his
imployment, and the expedition hee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
of his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> may be ſeene the
day of my Birth in his papers, and that
of my Baptiſme in the Regiſters of the
Church where I receiued it.</p>
                  <p>Let theſe bee brought, and it will bee
found that it cannot bee I ſhould bee his
Daughter; ſince by the immooueable
Lawes of Nature, a childe (to liue) muſt
of neceſsitie bee borne either vpon the
ſeuenth, ninth, or eleuenth moneth after
Conception: And ſo farre was it from
any of theſe, as in the beginning of the
eight after his returne, I was borne; a
time altogether inſufficient, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of giuing life to a childe.</p>
                  <p>Being not Daughter to <hi>Fabritio,</hi> I am
not Neece, nor of kinne to <hi>Hipolito;</hi>
Now ſince freedome and libertie begets
the will; the will conſent; and conſent
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19405:77"/>
the Marriage; and that all this hath
giuen me for wife to <hi>Hipolito:</hi> Since no
alliance can bee any barre betweene vs;
ſince force, or violence drawes, or workes
no obligation; and ſince by that onely,
I was caſt vnder the bondage and ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of <hi>Pompeio:</hi> why ſhall it not bee
lawfull, for mee to redeeme my libertie,
from the vniuſt vſurpation, of him that
hath too long abuſed, and enioyed by
violence, what was none of his; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
my ſelfe, into the hands of him to
whom God, the Lawes, my Election, and
my Faith hath giuen me.</p>
                  <p>The contentment that I giue my ſelfe,
in being able to worke my releaſe from
mine enemies; makes me reſolue to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with cheerefulneſſe, all the iniuries
of Fortune, of the Heauens, of the Time,
of Neceſsitie, and all that can happen me
in a ſtrange Clime: Where reſolued to
goe confine my ſelfe, and end the reſt
of my dayes; I beg of my friends no
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19405:78"/>
more, then to forget my name, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
me dead.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>This Euidence being read, ſhee was
asked, what ſhee intended with thoſe
poyſons; ſhe ſaid, ſhee made them to
take, if ſhee were purſued ſo narrowly,
as ſhee could not ſaue her ſelfe; to the
end, to barre her enemies the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and preuent the miſchiefe of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
aliue into their power.</p>
            <p>After ſhee had confeſt much more,
and more voluntarily, then ſhee was
queſtioned; the Vncle ſaid; ſince you
determined to bee your owne executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,
and puniſh your owne diſhone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie;
it were pitie (though you haue
beene preuented in the execution of ſo
wicked an enterpriſe) that you ſhould
bee fruſtrated too, in the iuſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you haue ſo well deſerued, and
ſo prouidently prepared for your ſelfe;
and therefore you are ſpeedily, by the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19405:78"/>
meane of your owne appointment, to
receiue your death; where-with, taking
one of the pilles, which her Vncle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
her; ſhee anſwered them; it is
for them that haue either pleaſure, or
deſire of life, to ſeeke the meanes to
keepe it; and for ſuch as haue loſt both
the one, and the other, to haſten the
end of it, and flie to death, which is ſo
farre from being a thing odious to mee,
(being depriued of my <hi>Hipolito</hi>) as
that (were ye as inclinable to pitie, and
ſhould deny it mee; as you are bent to
cruelty, and to giue it me) I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, to let mee take it with my
owne hands.</p>
            <p>Now after all the trecherous, and
ignoble courſes you haue taken againſt
me; I muſt confeſſe my ſelfe much
bound to you, for ſhortning my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
life, whoſe end, is as pleaſing to
mee, as the courſe hath beene vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate:
hoping that as God doeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorde
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19405:79"/>
you by this meane, the triumph
of your deſires ouer me, and mee the
end of my afflictions; hee will alſo
pleaſe to giue my ſoule her reſt in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
bliſſe, which I humbly craue of
him, and that the long paines of my
life, and vniuſt Martyrdome of my
death, may obtaine mee his pitie, and
my ſinnes their pardon.</p>
            <p>Shee ſpake theſe words, with ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,
and vnmooued a face, and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that all thoſe about her, were ſeized
with aſtoniſhment, and pitie.</p>
            <p>Her Vncle himſelfe, and Husband
began to ſpeake to her, teſtifying a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of their doome, and rage;
when ſhe ſwallowed the Pill, and with
a nimble hand taking two more, ſaid;
One is too few, and nothing is hard to
doe that giues vs contentment, and
barres our enemies the pleaſure of a
long vengeance.</p>
            <p>Soone after, the force and quantitie
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19405:79"/>
of the poyſon wrought his effect; and
ſeizing all the Vitall parts, left her one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power to ſpeake theſe laſt words:
Receiue, receiue, my <hi>Hipolito,</hi> theſe laſt
proofes of my affection; and know by
my death, what power a faithfull loue
hath in a ſoule reſolued: and vpon that
word yeelded vp the ghoſt, in the ſame
chaire, where they had ſet her: leauing
her memory no leſſe admirable, for the
conſtancy of her end, then remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
for the bouldneſſe of her deſperate
enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>Here (Reader) with <hi>Iſabella's</hi> end,
would I end too; ſo wearied I am,
with the already too ſad relation, of
theſe vnhappy Louers fortunes, and
moſt vnwilling to adde hereto, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
end of the poore <hi>Hipolito,</hi>
whom my Authour tells mee, his <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella's</hi>
death, made ſo deſperat a deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
of his owne life, as to forſake all his
hopes, meanes of ſuſtenance, friends
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:19405:80"/>
and allies, and die an exile to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
for her reuenges ſake.</p>
            <p>For I finde that within few weekes
after her death, hee ſlew her Husband,
and his Vncle vpon their way, in a
iourney to <hi>Rome;</hi> for which fact, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Brothers (who being queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
about him, were driuen to much
trouble for him) nor any other friend,
or his Countrey durſt owne him: but
hee was conſtrained (being oppreſt
with extreame want) to returne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
into the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> where
fiue yeeres after <hi>Iſabella's</hi> death, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide
ſtaruing, he was inforced to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a Widdow, that had ſome reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
meanes to ſuſtaine him a while
with, but no more then what hee had
in a ſhort time ſo farre waſted, as ſhee
(as well out of diſcontentment thereat,
as alſo diſcouering perhaps withall, the
many degrees of compariſon betweene
the loue ſhee found hee bore her, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19405:80"/>
might imagine, hee might beare to an
<hi>Iſabella,</hi> or one more worthy of him,
then ſhe, who was neither handſome,
nor well natured) poyſoned him, as it
was thought, with a meſſe of broath,
ſhee cauſed to bee made for him one
morning, that hee had taken a little
Phyſick, for ſome indiſpoſition of body
he complained of.</p>
            <p>There was found in his Study, after
his death a table, which it ſeemed, hee
had not long before cauſed to be made,
wherein there was Painted his <hi>Iſabella,</hi>
lying along dead, with her eyes cloſed,
and himſelfe, kneeling at her feete, with
certaine verſes vnder written; ſpeaking
