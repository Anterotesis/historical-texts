            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <figure/>THE LORD HVMES HIS SPEECH <hi>To both Houses of</hi> Parliament in SCOTLAND.</head>
            <p>GENTLEMEN, and you the <hi>Knights,</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> of each COVNTY of this KINGDOME: wee are here Assembled to doe GODS businesse, and the Kings: in which our owne is included, and we are <hi>Christians,</hi> as wee are Subjects. Let us first feare God, then shall wee honour the King the more: I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid wee have beene the lesse prosperous in our affaires; because we have preferred other things before him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95062:3"/>
The Kingdome is likewise reduced to great Strait, for being locked up from the free course of Trade, betweene <hi>England</hi> and us, wherein it were undutifulnesse beyond <hi>Inhumanity,</hi> in the taking of advantage against them.</p>
            <p>I have often thought, and said, that it must be some extremity that would rectifie this Kingdome: and when that extremity did come, it would bee <unclear>a</unclear> great hazard, whether it would prove a remedy or aruine; wee are sure that the greatest part of our Country is undone for the want of free Trade, and the priviledges which formerly wee had therein, by Trading betweene <hi>England</hi> and us, &amp; for a better Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and Enter-course betweene this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and <hi>England,</hi> and that it may bee lawfull to Trade and transport Goods and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities from this Kingdome into <hi>England,</hi> as formerly we have done, and they to use with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any let or hinderance by each <hi>Kingdome,</hi> which is our desires.</p>
            <p>I confesse he is no good Subject, that will willingly take up Armes against his King, and will nor willingly and freely lay downe his life, when the end may better the service of his Majesty, and the good of the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us further reflect upon the ill effects, what those courses have wrought, what by a dissension from us on the one side, and a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the other, some imagining what was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95062:3"/>
intended, and made haste to turne before hand the better to be accepted of, and a great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them, seeing how farre they were gone, and fearing how much further they should goe, have bin forced to fly the Land.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Foundations</hi> are shaken, it is high time to looke to the <hi>Building:</hi> hee hath no heart, no head, no soule, that is not moved in his whole man to look upon the distresses, and the miseries of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> that is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in all that hee hath to redresse them in a right way. But rather let us make it an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for them to doe them best service, when they have most need, not to speake our owne good, but in them, and with them, else we shall commit the same Crimes our selves, which we must condemne in others.</p>
            <p>Now we see what the Sores are in generall, and when more particulars shall happen to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, let us bee very carefull to draw out the koares of them, and not skimme them over with a slight suppurating fester cure, lest they should presently breake out againe into grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mischiefes, consider of that Counsels, and speake your minds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95062:4"/>
The which I humbly beseech this House, that it may be done with as much moderation, as the publique safety of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible admit.</p>
