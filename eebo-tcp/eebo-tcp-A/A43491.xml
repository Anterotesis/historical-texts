            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I found him a Nameleſs over-worn Wittal, that five times before I eſpied him, had adulterated the Preſs, and abuſed <hi>Ladies</hi> and <hi>Gentlewomen;</hi> And no Man durſt anſwer him: for ſo he reported. I will ſee what, and who, this diſeaſed <hi>Maccabee</hi> is; This (as yet) unconquered enemy of <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> and defie him: and prove his diſcourſe, and hard cenſure of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> and <hi>Gentlewomen</hi> like the blaſts of Rams horns before the walls of <hi>Jericho;</hi> that throwes down the Reputation of <hi>Ladies</hi> at one utterance.</p>

And for my preſent boldneſs, you may thank your ſelf; you taught me this familiarity, and you may ſee what unprofitable affections you have purchaſed. I propoſe nothing for your inſtruction; Nature hath
<pb facs="tcp:57224:4"/>
done her part; and I would make you my Judge, not my Pupill: if therefore amongſt your ſerious and more dear Retirements, you can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this trifle but ſome few minutes, and think them not loſt; you will perfect my ambition, you will place me (Sir) at my full height; and though it were like that of <hi>Statius</hi> amongſt <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Stars;</hi> I ſhall quickly find the <hi>Earth</hi> again, and with the leaſt opportunity preſent my ſelf,</p>

And ſince every Woman Judges her ſelf the faireſt; ſhee that would be backward to this Arbitriment, would be diffident of her ſelf; and conſequently a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negade from her Sex.</p>
            <p>Next, take care of the ſubtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Men: and conſider their deſignes, which may be more Loving to your Portion, then your Perſon: All people having not the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of beauty; which is as hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to an <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> as <hi>Black</hi> is to us: not conſidering that Women
<pb facs="tcp:57224:7"/>
uncloathed are all alike; and the Conceptions about the harmony and meaſures of her Body differ not.</p>
            <p>Yet I adviſe you not to follow the example of a Princeſs appearing in a Lawn ſmock, to be veiwed by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, as towards a Marriage<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſaid, ſhe would put off that too, if there were any neceſſity. But cuſtome hath made Cloaths decent. The deeds of our Anceſtors, are not to be ſlighted; for they left them for our example; and uſed in their days abundance of cheaper Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Ornaments, from Shels, Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Stones. Behold the Sun and Moon, and all the Glorious Batalia of Heaven; and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as the Great God and Nature made them; to which God and Nature, I am Servant and Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>
            <p>This will not produce ſuch infinite
<pb facs="tcp:57224:8"/>
provocations and incitements to luſt as the <hi>Advice to a Son</hi> fondly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives. But I ſay not. For I dare ſay, that what by Painting, what by the Looſeneſs and Change of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what by theſe gaudy inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of dreſſings, that flexure and fracture of gate, the deformity is hidden: unleſs to a very nice eye, there is much more fuell added, then if all went with no more Mantles, Scarfes, Gowns, and Hoods, then Nature thruſt them into the World with, <hi>viz.</hi> Hair hanging looſely down, or elſe careleſly gathered up in a Fillet; and perhaps ſome little kind of Cover, that might reſtrain, the Virginall flower, from being too much gazed at, and blown upon. Follow not (Daughter) their faſhion that uncover the parts of their chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Beauty, as their Face, Neck, Breaſts and Hand, as the Index to
<pb facs="tcp:57224:8"/>
the more ſecret object; which without a ſigne may be by the guide of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature ſound out: So that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do endeavour in part to break that reſtraint which bides the reſt of their Glory, and to ſet forth their delicate Dreſſes, plaited and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with ſuch variety, their Ivory Necks, their Harmonious Faces, their Milkie Spherical Breaſts, and their Melting Hands: my advice is to ſhew All, or Nothing. Daughter though ſome Crazy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant old welch <hi>Owens,</hi> with powder dried bones, fit to be burnt, with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, hath endeavoured to deceive you from the ſame Species, with Men; and one madder then they, denie you Souls; and ſo have many others: yet when we ſhall oppoſe Holy Scripture, which makes Man the Conſummation of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and you the Conſummation of
<pb facs="tcp:57224:9"/>
Man: if I ſhould but inſtance thoſe particular indulgencies of Nature which <hi>John Heydon</hi> reckons unto you, and thoſe peculiar advantages of compoſition and underſtanding he aſcribes to you; or if I ſhould men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that of <hi>Eugenius Theodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dactus,</hi> that friend to the Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Roſie Croſs,</hi> and beleeved to be inſpired, and ſo thought a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie Cruſian;</hi> he (I ſay) calls you <hi>Fountains</hi> and perfections of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Whom (Daughter) can we imagine to be ſo inſenſible as not to be preſently touched with the delicate Compoſure and Symmetry of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Bodies? The ſweetneſs and killing Languors of their eyes? The meſtange and harmony of their Colours? The happineſs and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallity of their Countenance? The Charms and allurements of their mind? The Air and Command of
<pb facs="tcp:57224:9"/>
their ſmiles? Men are meerly rough caſt, briſtly, and made up of tough Materials: and if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach any thing near Beauty, do ſo much degenerate from what they are.</p>
            <p>How generall is the affection of old Men to Women? ſome I have known of three ſcore to Marry Girles of ſixteen. <hi>Soloman</hi> was no fool; and it is well known, how your ſex tempted him; that his power Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you to fulfill his deſires. And I only adviſe you to Wiſdome and Vertue. And if any Clumſy old doting Wittall, blinded with Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and by his own Wofull Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhall proteſt againſt the Sufficiency of theſe, or any thing elſe I have written, or ſhall write for your better inſtructions, that may perhaps hereafter be made publike; He wilfully goes about to Councel his
<pb facs="tcp:57224:10"/>
Maſter; and adventures to make the Sun ſtand ſtill; and to run ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther race. For your ſake I ſet Pen to Paper, to teach you how to live; that to Die you need not fear.</p>
            <p>The World is full of deceit: truſt not therefore the hot love of a Stranger: for if you will expoſe your ſelf to all, you are Slighted: and a Common Wife is hated.</p>
            <p>Beauty affords Contentment; Riches are meanes to cure a weak Eſtate: Honour illuſtrates all comes nigh it. If you Marry thus, you are happy; And then to find Worth, Carriage Geſture and Grace, in your choyce, it perfects felicity.</p>
            <p>Theſe things in this Book are written for your inſtruction; hopeing you will excuſe my faults; which through haſt and other infirmity are Committed. A more Leaſure time may perfect what is here Charactered

            <head>ADVIGE to a DAUGHTER. In oppoſition to the ADVICE to a SONNE.</head>
            <p>WHo is this that darkneth Councel, by Words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Knowledge? Come thou Embrio of a Hiſtory, thou Cadet of a Pamphleteer; Gird up thy loins like a man, for I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of thee, and anſwer thou me.</p>
            <p>But now I think upon it, I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee time to breath, after thy late Bawling thoſe fragments of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Atheiſtical old Pamphlet, intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Thy <hi>Advice to a Son,</hi> and ſpeak a few words to my Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> I have met with a <hi>Thing;</hi> it is not named, It ſpeaks like a Man, and yet abuſes Women: It is the firſt Tincture and Rudiments of a VVriter,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57224:12"/>
dipped as yet in the preparative Blew, like an Almanack well-wilier.</p>
            <p>To call him an <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> is to Knight a <hi>Mandrake;</hi> to ſay he is a <hi>Politician,</hi> is view him throw a Perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and by that groſs Hyperbole to give the reputation of an Engineer to a maker of <hi>Mouſe-traps.</hi> He is ſuch an one as Queen <hi>Mabbs</hi> Regiſter: One, who by the ſame figure that a North Country Pedlar is a Marchant man, you may ſtile an Author: There goes his Affection, which is the <hi>Heliotrope</hi> to the Sun of Honour; and hath long ſince abjured his God, Religion, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and all that ſhall interpoſe and skreen him from thoſe Beams that may ripen his wiſhes and aims into injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>And now have at his <hi>Advice to a Son.</hi> Come thou Relique of a Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, that <hi>five times</hi> at leaſt (by I know not what <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> haſt adulterated the Preſſe: And have you ſo much Policy in your Advice to your Son that the Readers miſtake your Name, and beleeve you to be the Tripple-headed Turn-key of Heaven?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:57224:12"/>Behold his <hi>Directions. For your better Conduct through the various and moſt important Encounters of this Life: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the five general Heads</hi> (I will cut off) and you will think him the Triple-headed Porter of Hell. Ladies, Fear him not, I am your Champion; Little <hi>David</hi> will fight Goliah.</p>
            <p>I ſcorne to kill him, I'le only box him, kick and cudgel him for his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and let him know, He is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man who hath beſiedged and taken a Town, not plotted to rob an Orchard, and for all his ſubtleties was VVhipt.</p>
            <p>But I muſt read firſt, and write after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Here comes the Pedee of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancer, with his <hi>Advice to a Son;</hi> 'Tis the Indorſement to the Packet, like a fine knot to a fine bundle: Come, Let's open in the name of good ſence: Oh! How it ſmells like a diſeaſed peece of an <hi>Apocripha</hi> taken out of <hi>Guzman</hi>'s rags, or burnt bones.</p>
            <p>VVhat ſaies this Father to his Son?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Though I can never pay enough to your Grandfathers Memory, for his tender Care in my Education; yet I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57224:13"/>
muſt obſerve in it this miſtake; that by keeping me at Home, where I was one of my young Maſters, I loſt the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of my moſt docile time. For not undergoing the ſame Diſcipline, I muſt needs come ſhort of their Experience that are bred up in Free Schools; who by plotting to rob an Orchard</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here he complains of the loſſe of thoſe times which I could wiſh I had not known. Daughter, I would have you as good as I could fancy one: and three things I would have you know; Firſt, <hi>Your own miſery;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>Gods Love;</hi> thirdly, <hi>Your thankfull Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> your miſery. How juſt? Gods Love, How free? How undeſerved? Your thankfullneſſe, How due? How neceſſary? Conſideration of one, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively begets the apprehenſion of all: Your condition ſhews you his Love; His Love calls for your acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Want makes a Bounty weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As your Education hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended by a foundation; ſo you may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour a requital, if God makes you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57224:13"/>
However let not the contrary afflict you, ſince it is obſerved by ſome, that his Name who burnt the Temple of</hi> Diana, <hi>out-laſted theirs that built it.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Anſwer, Of Education I ſay thus much, It is ſeen every where: If you travel but from <hi>White Hall</hi> to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter,</hi> or from a Village to an Accade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; or ſee but a Horſe well manag'd, and another reſty in his own fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Dyet</hi> no queſtion alters much; even the giddy Airyneſs of the <hi>French,</hi> I ſhall rather impute to their Dyet of VVine and wild Foul, then to the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their Clime; it being ſo neer an adjoyner to ours. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in England, I beleeve our much uſe of Strong beer, and groſs Fleſh is a great occaſion of dregging our Spirits, and corrupting them till they ſhorten life. Age is alſo a changer; Man hath a Zenith, as well in VVit as in ability of Body; He grows from ſence to Reaſon, and then again declines to Dotage, and to imbecillity: Youth is too young in brain; and Age again, does drain away the Spirits: Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion blunts the edge of Conceit, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57224:14"/>
where there is much ſorrow the mind is dull and unperceiving; the Soul is oppreſſed, and lies languiſhing in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociable lonelineſs, till it proves ſtupid and inhumane: Nor do theſe more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Mind then the Body.</p>
            <p>VVeigh every Mans Education as his means have been: A man may look in vain for Courtſhip in a Plow man, or Learning in a Mechanick. VVho would expect a lame man ſhould run ſwiftly? Or that a ſick man ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver an Oration with a Grace and cheerfullneſs? If you find any man fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Manners, you muſt conſider his Means, before you cenſure the Man: and one that is ſhort of what he might be, by his ſloath and negligence, you muſt think as juſtly blameable, as he that out of his Induſtry hath adorned his behaviour above his Means, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Let not an over-paſſionate proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Learning</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>draw you from making an honeſt improvement of your Eſtate; as ſuch do who are better read in the bigneſſe of the whole Earth,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57224:14"/>
then in that little ſpot left them by their friends, for their ſupport.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I Anſwer. (You clumſie <hi>Epithite</hi>) Nothing wraps a Man in ſuch a miſt of Errors, as his own Curioſitie in twiſting himſelf into things above him. How happily do they live, that know nothing but what is neceſſary? Your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth but ſhew your Ignorance; Your <hi>moſt ſtudious ſcrutenies is but a diſcovery of what the Spirit knew before it was imbodied: You find the effect, but not the Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, If I muſt deſcribe a meer Scholer, He is an intellegible Aſſe, or ſilly fellow in Black, that ſpeaks Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences more familiarly then Sence, and Latine better then his Mother Tongue; But is a ſtranger to no Countrie but his own; He is Ambitious, and tells great ſtories of himſelf, to no purpoſe, for they are commonly ridiculous, be they true or falſe; doubtleſs he is a <hi>Graduate;</hi> but if ever he get a <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> he hath then no Fellow: in ſpight of all <hi>Logick</hi> he dares ſwear and maintain it, that a Cuckold and a Townſ-man are <hi>Termini
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57224:15"/>
Convertibiles,</hi> though his Mothers Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and the Father of the <hi>Advice to a Son</hi>'s Father, be <hi>Aldermen</hi> in the ſingular Number: He cannot but wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with harmleſs VVomen: His Tongue goes alwaies before his VVit, like the Gentleman Uſher, but abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance faſter: He is long-winded, and able to ſpeak more with eaſe, than any man can endure to hear with Patience: Univerſity Jeſts are his univerſal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and his News the Demeanour of the Proctors: His phraſe (the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel of his Mind) is made of divers ſhreds like a Cuſhion, and when it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth plaineſt it hath a raſh out-ſide, and Fuſtian Linings; the current of his Speech is clos'd with an <hi>Ergo:</hi> and what ever be the Queſtion, the Truth is on his ſide: 'tis a wrong to his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be ignorant in any thing, and yet he knows not that he knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: He gives Directions for Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry from <hi>Virgils Georgicks,</hi> for Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from his <hi>Bucolicks:</hi> He would be thought as great a Duelliſt as <hi>Heydon,</hi> and as ſtout a Fighter: He ſpeaks of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57224:15"/>
Warlike Stratagems from his <hi>Eucides,</hi> or <hi>Ceaſars Commentaries:</hi> He orders all things, and thrives by none: He is led more by his Ears then his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, taking the empty ſound of words for their true ſence; and does therefore confidently ſay, that <hi>Aera Pater</hi> was the Father of Hereticks; <hi>Rodolphus Agricola</hi> a ſubſtantial Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and will aver that <hi>Syſtimo</hi>'s Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick doth excell <hi>Kickermans:</hi> His ill luck is not ſo much in being a Fool, as in being put to ſuch pains to expreſs it to the World; for what in others is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, in him (with much adoe) is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial: His Poverty is his Happineſs, for it makes men beleeve he is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man: That Learning that he hath was put in backward, like a Cliſter; and is now like ware miſ-laid in a Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars pack, he has it, but knows not where it is. And this is the Index of a Man, and the Title page of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: a new Religion in Morality; much in Profeſſion, nothing in Practiſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His Father ſayes, <hi>A mixt Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſuits Imployment beſt: Scholers
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57224:16"/>
and Cittzens by a too long plodding in the ſame track, have their Experience ſeldom dilated beyond the Circle of a narrow Profeſſion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, There is no Syntax be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Cap of Maintainance, and a Helmet: Although we have caution enough againſt theſe mixt multitudes in ſad and frequent experience; theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages groaning under an Exorbitant Clergy. Yet ſuch is the eaſineſs and Credulity of the Vulgar, ſuch the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilety and diſſembling ſanctity of the Impoſture, that he meets with as great a proneſſe in the People to be cozen'd, as he brings willingneſſe to delude. For it is a true Obſervation, that theſe Clancular Sermocinators bear as great ſway in Popular minds, and make as deep impreſſion upon their Conſciences, as the Loyaliſts does when they impoſe upon their blind Layty.</p>
            <p>I ſuſpect this Clerical Statiſt, that makes him that cannot deceive, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how to live.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>I have obſerved in Collegiate Diſcipline,</hi> &amp;c:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57224:16"/>I Anſwer, Here he fancies the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> as the principal men to perfect Patience and Obedience in Youth; when I ſuſpect him in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation of Sacred Oracles, who (as it is ſaid) tampers with Secular affairs of no Concernment to his Auditors Souls: but this Diſcipline is the common skreen of his private deſigne.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>If a more profitable Imployment pull you not too ſoon from the Vniverſity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Here he would have his Son make ſome inſpection into Phyſick, which will make him welcome: If he know but how to make a Suppoſitory to pleaſe a Lady, he will be reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced beyond a Holy Father, or the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of the Pariſh.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Do not proſecute beyond a ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Knowledge, any Learning that moves upon no ſtronger Legs, then the tottering baſis of Conjecture is able to afford it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Learning is like a River (Sir,) whoſe head being far in the Land, is at the firſt Riſing little, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily veiwed, but ſtill as you go it gapeth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57224:17"/>
with a wider Bank; not without plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and a delightfull winding, while it is on both ſides ſet with Trees, and the Beauties of various Flowers; but ſtill the further you follow it the deeper and broader it is, till at laſt it in waves it ſelf in the unfathom'd Ocean. In many things you may ſound Nature in the ſhallows of her Revelations; we may trace her in her ſecond Cauſes; but beyond them we meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Miſteries of the holy company of un-bodied Souls, which have, and ſome not yet have been bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died: and this puzzels your clog'd Spirit, and dazels your minds dim eyes which peeps through the Body.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Huge Vollumnes, like the Ox roaſted whole in</hi> Bartholmew Fair, <hi>may proclaim plenty of Labour and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but afford leſſe of what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, ſavory, and well concocted, then ſmaller peeces,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Idle Books (like you Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Knave, and Artificial Diſſembler) are nothing elſe but corrupted Tales in Ink and Paper: And indeed your vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57224:17"/>
Books ſent abroad, makes him that reads them Conſcious of a double inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; they being in effect, like that bruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſin of Adultery; for if One reads, Two are catch'd. He that Angles in theſe Waters, is ſure to ſtrike the <hi>Torpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do;</hi> that inſtead of being his Food, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds him. Beſides the time ill ſpent in them, a twofold reaſon ſhall make you refrain, both in regard to your own Soul, and pitty unto him that made them: for if you be corrupted by them, the Compoſer of them is medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately a cauſe of your ill; and at the day of reckoning (though now dead) muſt give an account for it: becauſe you are corrupted by his bad example, which he leaves behind him: ſo you become guilty by receiving; he by thus conveying this lewdneſſe unto you: He is the Theef, you the Receiver: and what difference makes our Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them? If one be cut off, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dyes; both periſh. Write not like him, leſt you hurt thoſe that come after you: Read not his Books, leſt you augment his mulct. A lame Hand is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57224:18"/>
better then a lewd Pen. And his fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Sentences dropt upon Paper, in <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to his Son,</hi> hath ſet Folly on a Hill, and is a Monument to make Women Infamous eternal.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57224:18"/>11. <hi>A few Books well Studied,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Some men read Books (you crampt Compendium) as Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men uſe Flowers; only for delight and ſmell, to pleaſe their fancy, and refine their Tongue: others like the Bees, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract only the Hony, the wholſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; and this alone they bear away, leaving the reſt, as little worth: the one of theſe inſtructs his mind, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tells what he hath Learned; it is pitty they ſhould be divided. He that hath worth in him, and cannot expreſs it, is as a Cheſt keeping a rich Jewel, and the Key loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Concealing Goodneſs is Vice. A good ſtile with wholeſome matter, is a fair Woman, with a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Soul; which attracts the eyes of all: The good man thinks Chaſtly, and loves her Beauty for her Vertue; which he ſtill thinks more fair, for dwelling in ſo fair an out-ſide. The Vicious man hath Luſtfull thoughts; and he would for her Beauty, fain deſtroy her Vertue: but comming to ſolicite his purpoſe, finds ſuch Divine Lectures from her Angels Tongue, and thoſe delivered
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57224:19"/>
with ſo ſweet a pleaſing Modeſty, that he thinks Vertue is diſſecting her Soul to him, to raviſh man with a Beauty which he dream'd not of: ſo he could curſe himſelf, for deſiring that lewdly, which he hath learned ſince, only to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and reverence. Thus he goes away better, that came with an intent to be worſe. Quaint phraſes on a good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, are baits to make an ill man Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. How many men ſeeking theſe vilely, have found themſelves Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertites?</p>

            <p>I Anſwer, This concerns the Wits of the Town, which he adviſes his Son to Converſe with, to refine his Spirit, better then Books: It may be ſo; and I beleeve they will ſell him Wit dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then Stationers their Books: And we know what they ſay of Bought Wit.</p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>Propoſe not them for Patterns, who make all Places rattle where they come, with Greek and Latine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, <hi>(Anonimus)</hi> I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

him a fooliſh jugler, that ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kels his words in any vulgar Mother-tongue, publickly with murmurs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lawful Magiſtrate, Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical or civil, unleſs he hath ſome better ground for his diſlike, then a thwarting his humour in things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſal and adiaphorous.</p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>Follow not the tedious practice of ſuch as ſeek wiſdom onely in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer; He is Pedantically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of his invention which is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll'd in Policy, that it drops black and malignant influences upon Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="15">15. <hi>Spend no time in reading, much leſs writing ſtrong lines, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer: Why ſo? (pray Sir) is it not worth your time to know the myſterious truth of natural Aſtrology, and the ſtrange and ſtrong lines of the learned <hi>Moſes?</hi> but there is no ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition in Politicks more odious, then to ſtand too much upon niceties.</p>
            <p n="16">16. <hi>Books flatly writ deface your ſtyle; the like may be truly objected to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57224:20"/>
weak preachers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I anſwer; The late King <hi>Charles</hi> indeed had a pen more majeſtical then the Crown he loſt, (but not as you ſay from experience <hi>the Miſtreſs of fooles</hi>) for he truſted in God, and it was he that gave him a wiſe and an underſtanding heart, (if not) others have known as much by experience as he that are not as he was, truly inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; The exceſs which is in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of preaching has made the Pulpit flighted, I mean the much bad Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory we find it guilty of: It is a wonder to me how men can preach ſo little in ſo long a time, as if they thought to pleaſe by their vain <hi>Tautologies;</hi> I ſee no reaſon that ſo high a Princeſs as Divinity is, ſhould be preſented to the people in ſuch ſordid rags of the tongue; nor he which ſpeaks from the father of Languages, ſhould deliver his Embaſſage in an ill one.</p>
            <p>A man can never ſpeak too well, where he ſpeaks not too obſcure: long and diſtended clauſes are both tedious to the ear, and difficult for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57224:20"/>
their retaining: a ſentence well couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed takes both the ſenſe and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; I love not thoſe cart-rope ſpeeches, that are longer then the memory of man can fathom; I ſee not but that Divinity, put into apt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants by <hi>Iohn Cleveland,</hi> might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh as well as his <hi>Poetry:</hi> The weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier lines men finde upon the Stage, I am perſwaded have been the Lures to draw away the Pulpit followers: we complain of drowſineſs at a Sermon, when a Play of a doubled length leads you on ſtill with alacrity; but the fault is not in our ſelves, if we ſaw Divinity acted, the geſture and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety would as much invigilate. But it is too ſlight to be perſonated by humanity, the Stage feeds both the ear and the eye; and through this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe the ſoul drinks deeper draughts; things acted poſſeſs us more and are more retainable then the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable tones of the tongue: Beſides, here we meet with more compoſed language, the <hi>Dulcia Sermonis</hi> put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fine phraſes, though it is to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57224:21"/>
ſuch wits are not ſet to the right tune, and conſorted to Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who without doubt, well deckt, will caſt a far more radiant luſtre, then thoſe obſcene ſcurrilities that the Stage preſents us with, though ſpang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their gaudieſt tire.</p>
            <p>At a Sermon well dreſt, what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtander can have a motion to ſleep? Divinity well ordered caſts forth a bait, which angles the ſoul into the ear; and how can that cloſe, when ſuch a gueſt ſits in it? They are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons like <hi>Eugenius Philalethes</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, which lead the eyes to ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and ſhould we hear a continued Oration, upon ſuch a ſubject as the Stage treats on, or <hi>Clevelands</hi> Poems in ſuch words as we hear ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, I am confident, it would not onely be far more tedious, but nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and contemptible. The moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they have of other places is in their good lines and actions; For it is certain, <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Roſſius</hi> are moſt complete, when they both make but one man; fit words are better then fine
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57224:21"/>
ones; I like not thoſe that are inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly made, but ſuch as be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ſignificant, that lead the mind to ſomething beſides the naked term: and he that ſpeaks this, muſt not ſpeak every day. A kemb'd Oration will coſt both ſweat and the rubbing of the brain, and kemb'd I wiſh it not frize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led nor curled: Divinity ſhould not laſciviate: unwormwooded jeſts I like well; but they are fitter for the Tavern, then the Majeſty of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Chriſt taught the people with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, gravity becomes the Pulpit: I became a writer, by ſpending more oyl then wine, this is too fluid an Element to beget ſubſtantials; wit procured by wine, is for the moſt part like the ſparkling in the glaſs, when tis filling; they brisk it for a moment, but dye preſently: I admire the valour of ſome men that before their ſtudies dare aſcend the Pulpit, and do there take more pains then in their Library; but having done this, I wonder not that they there ſpend ſometimes two hours but to weary the people into
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57224:22"/>
ſleep; and this makes fugitive Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, like cowards to run away from their Text: words, matter, and geſture with admirable tongue complete a Sermon. I know God hath choſen by weak things to confound the wiſe, yet I ſee not but in all times a waſhed language hath much prevailed, and even the Scriptures were penned in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> a tongue of deep expreſſion, wherein every word hath almoſt a Metaphorical ſenſe, which does illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate by ſome alluſion. How Political is <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Pentateuch, how phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical <hi>Iob,</hi> how maſſy and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious is <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Proverbs, how quaint and flamingly amorous in his Canticles? how grave in his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtes? How were the Jews aſtonied at Chriſts Doctrine? how Eloquent a pleader is <hi>Paul?</hi> He that reads the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhall find them written as if with a criſped pen.</p>
            <p>I grieve that any thing ſo excellent as <hi>Divinity</hi> ſhould fall into ſuch a ſluttiſh handling; though other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures do eclipſe her, yet this is a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57224:22"/>
principal: I never knew a good tongue wanted ears to hear it, nor a well-pend Book want a friend to read it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that are cordials are not the worſe but the better for being gilded. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Let no man be dark and full of ſhadow; there is a way to be pleaſingly plain, and ſome have found it: Philoſophy or Poetry may come in and wait to pleaſe the gueſts with a Trencher at a Banquet.</p>

            <p>I anſwer, Happy will it be if you keep baſe company, and learn to loath their errours in your ſelf. I commend to you for your immitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the lines of the late King, and the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and his grave Eccleſiaſtes, all very well pen'd.</p>

            <p>I anſwer; No book is ſo meanly pen'd but that there is ſomething in it that may teach you what you knew not before, and if you write books, let your ſubject be truth, and it written plainly; for though it may prove fruitleſs to many, becauſe not underſtood, nor regarded, yet ſome few may be of that Spirit, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend

               <p>I Anſwer; you <hi>Theban Wittal,</hi> I will ſhew you that conceptions and apparitions are nothing really, but motion in ſome internal ſubſtance of the head; which motion not ſtopping there, but proceeding to the heart, of neceſſity muſt there either help or hinder the motion which is called vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; when it helpeth, it is called de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, contentment, or pleaſure, which is nothing but motion in the head, and the objects that cauſe it are called pleaſant, or delightful, or by ſome name equivalent; the Latines have <hi>jucundum ajuvando,</hi> from helping; and the ſame delight, with reference
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57224:38"/>
to the object, is called <hi>Love;</hi> but when ſuch motion weakneth or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the vital motion, then it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pain;</hi> and in relation to that which cauſeth it Hatred, which the Latines expreſs ſometimes by <hi>odium</hi> and ſometimes by <hi>taedium.</hi>

               <p>I anſwer; Its very true, ſome think outward beauty the onely Jewell that deſerveth wearing; yet the wiſe man counts it but an accident, that can neither adde nor diminiſh, to the worth of virtue as ſhe is in her ſelf: ſo as he never eſteems her more or leſs but as he finds her accompliſht with diſcretion, honeſty, and good parts. If my <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> be virtuous and nobly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57224:38"/>
minded, my ſoul ſhall love her, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever her body be fram'd; and if beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty make her amiable, <hi>I</hi> ſhall like her the better: the Sun is more glorious in a clear sky, then when the Horizon is clouded, Beauty is the wit of nature put into the frontiſ-piece; if there be any humane thing may teach faith reaſon; this is it. In other things we imagine more then we ſee, in this we ſee more then we can imagine, I have ſeen (and yet not with a partial eye) ſuch features and ſuch mixtures, as I have thought impoſſible for either Nature to frame, or Art to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, yet in the face I have ſeen that which hath out-gone them both, the Countenance: oh if ſuch Beauty be in the body, what is in the ſoul! or if ſuch glory can dwell with corruption, what celeſtial excellencies are in the Saints above! who would not gaze himſelf into admiration when he ſhall ſee ſo rich a treaſure in ſo pure a Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, unmatched virtue, in matchleſs Beauty? for if my Miſtreſſes body hath more comlineſs then her ſoul good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

                  <hi>I</hi> like her the worſe for being but outwardly fair; wickedneſs in beauty is a traitor of the bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, poyſon in ſweet meats; a vicious ſoul in a beautiful body is like a <hi>Papiſt</hi> that will go to Church.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> anſwer; <hi>Pigwiggin Myrmidon</hi> you are ſevere againſt the ſex, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, as you think all women bad; yet others, I have heard durſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm they are all good; ſure though you ſpeak as you find, there is reaſon to direct your opinion, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the whole ſex, which in a ſtrict examination makes more for their honour then you have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. At firſt ſhe was created his equal, onely the difference was in the ſex: otherwiſe they both were man. If I muſt box you to the Text, and there argue, both male and female made man; ſo the man being put firſt was worthier. I anſwer, you <hi>(flea-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten canonick weed)</hi> ſo the evening and the morning was the firſt day, yet few will think the night the better: that man is made her <hi>governour,</hi> and ſo to be placed above her, I believe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57224:41"/>
rather the puniſhment of her ſin, then the prerogative of his worth: had they both ſtood, it may be thought, ſhe had never lien undermoſt, and in that ſubjection, for then it had not been a curſe, but another eſtate which had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bleſſedneſs in it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Yet this may be ſaid for it, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; you <hi>(Camel)</hi> rail againſt women, when all grant her body more admirable and more beautiful then mans; fuller of curioſities, and noble natures wonders, both for conception and foſtering the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted birth; and can we think that God would put a worſer ſoul into a better body? when man was created, tis ſaid, God made man: but when woman tis ſaid, God builded her, as if he had been about to make a frame of rarer roomes, and more exact compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: and without doubt, in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhe is much more wonderful; and by this we may think her ſo in her mind; and though the ſoul be not cauſed by the body, yet in the general it follows the temperament of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57224:41"/>
it: ſo the comelieſt out-ſides are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally (for the moſt part) more vertuous within. If place can be any priviledge, we ſhall find her built in Paradiſe, when man was made without it.</p>

               <p>I anſwer; You enemy to woman, it was never found, but in two men onely, that their love exceeded that of the feminine <hi>ſex:</hi> and if you obſerve them you ſhall find they were both of melting diſpoſitions. <hi>I</hi> know when <hi>women</hi> prove bad, they are a ſort of the vileſt creatures; yet the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon gives it, for <hi>optima corrupta peſſima,</hi> the beſt things corrupted become the worſt; <hi>women</hi> are things whoſe ſouls

are of a more ductible temper then the harder mettal of man, ſo may be made both better and worſe; you ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize them with impertinent devices they were never guilty of: it is true, they are not of ſo tumultuous a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as man, ſo not ſo fit for great <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> natural heat does more actuate the ſtirring <hi>genius</hi> of man; their eaſie natures make them ſomewhat more unreſolute, whereby men have argued them of fear and inconſtancy.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> anſwer; Again he ſnarles bitterly, and thinks, after they were made ill, God made them fearful, that man might rule them, otherwiſe they had been paſt dealing with. I am fully minded to honour virtue in what ſex ſoever I find it, and I think in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral I ſhall find it more in women then in men, though weaker, and more infirmly guarded: I believe they are better, and may be wrought to be worſe; neither ſhall the faults of ſome make me uncharitable to all, nor the goodneſs of ſome make me credulous of the reſt, though hitherto I confeſs I have not found more ſweet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant goodneſs in man then <hi>I</hi> have found in woman: and yet of theſe I have not found a number.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> anſwer; You Neaſt Gull of a young Apocrypha, both ſexes made but man, ſo that marriage perfects creation:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57224:43"/>
when the husband and the wife are together, the world is contracted in a bed; and without this, like the head and body parted, either would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume without a poſſibility of reviving. And though this nameleſs wight be an enemy to the name of marriage, yet you may catch him dabling in the uſe on't: Surely, he was made a <hi>Religious Hermaphrodite</hi> that is not tending to propagation, nature in her work made him not truly ſo; for it never made any thing in vain: He that is perfect and marries not, may in ſome ſort be ſaid to be guilty of a contempt againſt nature, as diſdaining to make uſe of her ſports and natural endowments.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> anſwer; Now Sir, that which the Turks hold is not without ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of reaſon: they ſay, he that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not at a fitting time (which they hold is about the age of twenty five years,) is not juſt, nor pleaſeth God: <hi>I</hi> believe it is from hence, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57224:44"/>
the vow of chaſtity is many times ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſuch inconveniences as we ſee enſue: I cannot think God is pleaſed with that which croſſeth his firſt ordination, and current of nature; and in themſelves it is a harder matter to root out an inſeparable ſway of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then they think of, without they quench it in virtue and beauty.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>As the fertility of the enſuing year, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; Chooſe a fit companion, a fit wife, a meet help; for the beſt chaſtity of all <hi>I</hi> hold to be matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial chaſtity, when pairs keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a moderate intermutableneſs each conſtant to the other, for ſtill it tendeth to union, and continuation of the world to poſterity. And it is fit both in nature and policy, that this propriety ſhould be inviolable; firſt, in reſpect of the impureneſs of mixt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity: next, in reſpect of peace and concord among men; if many men (as he ſaith) ſhould be intereſſed in one woman, it could not be but there would infinite jarres ariſe. Some have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57224:44"/>
complained of Chriſtian Religion, in that it tyes men ſo ſtrictly in this point, and when matches happen ill, there is no means of remedy. But ſurely if liberty or change were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, all would grow to confuſion: and it would open a ſluce to many miſchiefs ariſing out of heat onely, which now by neceſſity are cooled, and made tame again.</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>Yet take one who thinks her ſelf rather beneath then above you, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; Thoſe I obſerve to agree beſt, you <hi>Epiſco-Maſtix,</hi> which are of free natures, not ſubject to the fits of choler; their freedom ſhuts out jealouſie, which is the canker of wedlock, and withal it divideth both joy and ſorrow; and when hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diſcloſe, they ever link in love. Nay, whereas ſmall and domeſtick jars more fret marriages then great ones and publick, thoſe two will take them away; freedom reveals them, that they ranckle not the heart to a ſecret lothing, and mildneſs bears them without anger or bitter words;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57224:45"/>
ſo they cloſe again after diſcuſſion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times in a ſtraighter tye. Poverty in wedlock is a great decayer of love and contentation; and riches can find many wayes to divert an inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but the mind of a man is all: ſome can be ſervile, and fall to thoſe labours, <hi>(he calls baſe drudgery)</hi> which another cannot ſtoop to. Above all, let the generous mind beware of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying poor; for though he cares the leaſt for wealth, yet he will be moſt galled with the want of it. Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited people never agree well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they are wilful in their brawls, and reaſon cannot reconcile them; where either are opinionately wiſe, Hell is there, unleſs the other be a Patient meerly: but the worſt is, when it lights on the woman, ſhe will think to rule, becauſe ſhe hath the ſubtiler brain, and the man will look for't, as the priviledge of his ſex; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there will be mad work, when wit is at war with prerogatives.</p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>I confeſs vaſt Eſtates are not ſo ſenſible, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:57224:45"/>I anſwer; (Mr. <hi>new-faſhioned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> Juſtice) where Marriage proves unfortunate, a woman with a bad Husband is much worſe then a man with a bad Wife; men have much more freedom to court their content abroad. There are ſome that account women onely as ſeed-plots for poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; <hi>(Anonymus)</hi> the Author of the <hi>Advice to a Son,</hi> (worſe;) he ſayes they are <hi>whores,</hi> and onely <hi>quench for their fires;</hi> but ſurely there is much more good in them, if they be diſcreet, they are <hi>women</hi> but in <hi>body</hi> alone; queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs, <hi>a woman with a wiſe ſoul</hi> is the fitteſt companion for man, otherwiſe God would have given him a friend rather then a Wife. A wiſe Wife comprehends both ſexes; ſhe is wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for her body, and ſhe is man within, for her ſoul is like her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. It is the Crown of bleſſings, when in one woman a man finds both a Wife and a friend. Single life he commends (to his Son) cannot have this happineſs, though in ſome minds it hath, many it prefers before it; this
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57224:46"/>
hath fewer cares, and more longings, but Marriage hath fewer longings, and more cares; and I think care in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage may be commendable, ſo I think deſire in ſingle life, is not an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of ſo high a bound as ſome men would make it, it is a thing accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies nature, and a man cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>Therefore (dear Son) if, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; <hi>Dear Daughter,</hi> ſome things there are, that mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence condemns without a literal Law; as injuſtice, blaſphemy, lying, &amp;c. But to curbe and quite beat down the deſires of the fleſh, is a work of <hi>Religion</hi> rather then of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and therefore ſaies Saint <hi>Paul, I had not known luſt to have been a ſin, if the Law had not ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> Votive abſtinence ſome cold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions may endure with a great deal of vexatious penitence; to live chaſt without vowing I like a great deal better, nor ſhall we find the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel ſo buſie to tempt us to a ſingle ſin of unchaſtity, as he will when it is a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57224:46"/>
ſin of unchaſtity and perjury too: I find it commended, but not impoſed; and when <hi>Iephtha's daughter</hi> died, they mourned, for that ſhe died a Maid.</p>

               <head>To the men-Readers concerning Women.</head>
               <p>AS certain it is, there ought to be a great care in the choice of a Wife; ſo the onely danger therein is beauty, by which men in all ages, both wiſe and fooliſh, have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed. And though <hi>I</hi> know it vain to uſe reaſons or arguments, as <hi>Iohn Heydon</hi> doth, in the <hi>way to bliſs and happineſs, a book of Hermetical Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, of long life health, youth, riches, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and virtue, &amp;c.</hi> there ſpeaking of women in one place, ſaith, They are imperfect men; and other things (he ſaith) worth your obſervation, to bring all to happineſs and bliſs; and perſwades you not to be captivated by beauty: for there being few or none that ever reſiſted that witchery, yet I cannot but warn you, as of other things, which may be your ruine and deſtruction. For the preſent time, it
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57224:58"/>
is true, that every man prefers his fantaſie in that appetite, before all other worldly deſires, leaving the care of honour, credit and ſafety in reſpect thereof. But remember, that though theſe affections do not laſt, yet the bond of Marriage dureth to the end of your life; and therefore better to be born withall in a Miſtriſs than in a Wife: for when your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſhall change, you are free to chuſe again, (if you give your ſelf that vain liberty.) Remember ſecondly, That if you marry for beauty, you bind your ſelf for all your life for that which perchance will neither laſt nor pleaſe you one year; and when you have it, it will be to you of no price at all: for the deſire dyeth when it is attained, and the affection pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth when it is ſatisfied. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member (as Mr. <hi>Heydon</hi> ſaith in his book of <hi>The Roſacrucian Method of Phyſick</hi>) When you were a child, that then you did love your Nurſe, and that you were fond of her; after a while you did love your dry-Nurſe, and did
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57224:59"/>
get the other; after you did alſo ſlight her: So wil it be with you in your liking in elder years; and therefore if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear to love, forbear to link, and after a while you ſhall find an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in your ſelf, and ſee another far more pleaſing then the ſecond or third love.</p>
               <p>But methinks the Ladies begin to frown, and whiſper forth theſe words; that I am melancholy, and ſpeak gravely and too ſolidly of the ſex. I do take courage again, and pluck up a youthful reſolution; look in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of Hiſtory, and you may find as many fair and brave examples of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue given by women, as there hath been by men. Look over the roll of them, and you may eaſily fill each of them into a ſufficient common-place; where many things put down as nobly done by men, it may be are either bruitiſh, heady, or paſſionate, whileſt in the women things appear more ſmooth and temperate; or if there be any think of paſſion or exorbitancy, it is but an addition of luſtre to the ſex,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57224:59"/>
as a bluſh, or glowing in the face ſets off their beauty.</p>
               <p>Imagine or wiſh a Governour to be of good entertainment, affable, open of countenance, and ſuch a one that harbours no crooked or dark deſigns; where can you find ſuch a one but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong women?</p>
               <p>Beſides their natural ſweetneſs and innocency, their talk is commonly directed to ſuch things, as it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be inferred, that their heads are not troubled about making of wars, and deceiving the people, or enlarging of Empires, or founding of Tyrannies. And what can be wiſhed is in women: If it be a happineſs to a people to have a religious Governour, then all Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy and experience teaches you, that the ſofteſt minds are moſt capable of theſe impreſsions; and that women are for the moſt part more violently hurried away by ſuch agitations then men are. How few men Prophets does this age afford us in compariſon of Propheteſſes? and ſome are but Aſtrologically read; the other by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57224:60"/>
and inſpiration qualified. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are great followers of Prieſts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; (their <hi>Genius</hi> being ſet in beauty) (as you may read) in a book of Mr. <hi>Heydons</hi> lately publiſhed, and called the <hi>Familiar Spirit,</hi> (are Angels.) Now in that book is ſhewed the name of every mans <hi>Genius,</hi> or Angel, and how to converſe with it diſtinct from the body; and that it will ſpeak with an audible voice in a corporeal ſhape, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If you wiſh for mercy in a Ruler, women are the tendereſt things on the earth, they have tears at command; and if tears be the effect of pity and compaſsion, and pity and compaſsion be the mother of virtue, muſt you not think that mercy rules moſt in them, and is the ſooneſt expected from them?</p>
               <p>If you expect affection from them; have not women many times cut off their hair, to make ropes for Engines, and ſtrings for Bowes? have they not given up their Rings and Jewels to defray charges? have they not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57224:60"/>
to periſh for their Husbands in their habitations? and what greater love of Country can be ſhewn? and how great would this be, if a woman looks upon her ſelf as the Mother of her Country? what tenderneſs would ſhe not have towards the people, her children? <hi>I</hi> could wiſh this noble ſex were reſtored to that right which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath beſtowed on it; and then we ſhould have all quiet and ſerene in Common-wealths: Courts would not be taken up with factions &amp; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minings, but all would flow into plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and liberty: inſtead of mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Armies, we ſhould be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Masks; and inſtead of depreſſing of factions, we ſhould have balls and amorous appointments. So that men might follow their handy-crafts, Oxen might plow, Mill-horſes drive about the wheel, whilſt all this labour and ſweat ſhould ſerve but for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and eaſineſs of the Court: and no wars; for women being of tender conditions, and moſt part of ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary lives, would not engage in ſuch
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57224:61"/>
rough employments proper onely for man, who is onely the beſt kind of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage; over whom they have alſo this priviledge, that they can bring forth the greateſt Conquerors, but man can onely deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>Wine is ſtrong, and nothing but truth excels women. But <hi>I</hi> ſee a volly of objections coming on, ſuch as <hi>I</hi> fear not to ſtand againſt, but will march up to the head of this enemies Troop, and there <hi>I</hi> will charge him thorough, for ſpeaking ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt women. Indeed women ought to rule; and how many ſots, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, obſtinate, proud, talkative, cruel, naturals and changlings, by vertue of a ſucceſsion or conqueſt, by clubs and war-like ſtratagems, have mounted the Throne? And women cannot be worſe at worſt then ſuch men; and withal, women are more eaſie and ſupple to be guided by wiſe Counſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lors; women are excellent creatures.

               <p>The Policy of a Tyrant to hold up his State, is firſt to make ſhew of a good Governour, by obſerving a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Mediocrity in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whole courſe of life. To

Worth without wealth, is like an able ſervant out of employment, he is fit for all buſineſſes, but wants where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to put himſelf into any: he hath good materials for a foundation, but miſſeth wherewith to rear the walls of his fame.

               <p>I anſwer; God will teach you to know you are not wiſe enough to chuſe for your ſelf; and therefore will lead you to a dependency on him, wherein he does like <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> who feeds not the expectation of Favourites that are apt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, but often croſſes them in their hopes and fears; thereby to tye them faſter in their duty and reverence, to his hand that giveth: and certainly you ſhall find this infallible; though God gives not your deſires, yet he alwayes imparts to your profit. How infinitely would you intangle your ſelf, if you could ſit down and obtain your wiſhes? do you not often wiſh that, which you after ſee would be your confuſion? and is not this, becauſe you ignorantly follow the fleſh, the body, and the blinded appetite, which look to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ſhell and outſide? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God reſpecteth the ſoul, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth his favour for the good of that, and his glory. God ſees and knows your
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57224:84"/>
heart, and things to come in certainty; you, but onely by <hi>Aſtrology;</hi> which doth often fail of predicting truth, or happily by <hi>A Roſacrucian,</hi> who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to my knowledge loſes himſelf in the clouds of the worlds occaſions: and no man would be more miſarble, then he that ſhould cull out his own wayes; what a ſpecious ſhew carried <hi>Midas</hi> his wiſh with it, and how it paid him with ruine at laſt? ſurely God will work alone, and man muſt not be of his counſel: nothing puts deſtruction on him ſooner, then when he preſumes to part the Empire with God. If you can be patient, God will be profitable; but the time and means you muſt leave to him, not challenge to your ſelf: neither muſt your own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours wholly be laid in the couch to late. The moral of the tale is a kind of an inſtructive Satyre, when the Carter prayed in vain to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not put his ſhoulder to the wheel: do your part with induſtry, and let God point the event. <hi>I</hi> have ſeen matters fall out ſo unexpected; neither

                  <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> not <hi>Roſacrucian</hi> could give any ſucceſſeful judgement of them; which have tutoured me in all affairs, neither to diſpair nor to preſume: not to deſpair, for God can help me; not to preſume, for God can croſs you. It is ſaid of <hi>Marius,</hi> that one day made him Emperor, the next ſaw him rule, the third, he was ſlain of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: never deſpair, becauſe you have a a God; never preſume, becauſe you are a man.</p>

He that would rule over many, muſt fight with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and conquer, and be ſure either to cut off thoſe that raiſe up tumults, or by a majeſtick awe, to keep them in a ſtrict ſubjection: ſlackneſs and conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence are the ruines of unſetled King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,

your paſsions and affections are the chief diſturbers of your civil State. What peace can you expect within you, while theſe rebels reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overcome? If they get a head your Kingdome is divided, ſo it cannot ſtand. Separations are the wounds of a Crown, whereby neglected, it will bleed to death: then you muſt ſtrive to ſubdue; if you cut them not off, you muſt yet reſtrain them. 'Tis no cruelty to deny a Traitor liberty, you muſt have them be your Subjects, not your Prince; they muſt ſerve you, and you muſt ſway them. If it cannot be without much ſtriving, you muſt be be content with a hard combat, that you may have a happy reign; 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you endure a ſhort skirmiſh, then a long ſiege, having once won the field you muſt keep it.</p>

people is a ſound head on a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited body; a good Common-wealth and a Ruler, is a healthful body with a head-aching, either are occaſions of ruines, both ſound preſervatives.

Though your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience cannot anſwer his perfection, yet endeavour it: If Chriſt be not your King to govern, he will neither be your Prophet to forewarn, nor your Prieſt to expiate: if you cannot come near it in effect, as being impoſsible, you muſt in deſire, as being convenient: ſo though leſs, yet if ſincere, you know he will accept it, not as meritorious, but reſpecting his promiſe.</p>

yet in them all, you find all the good that ever either the heathen, or the Chriſtian hath publiſhed abroad: in the firſt is all natural Philoſophy: in the ſecond all moral Phyloſophy: in the third all true Divinity, to thoſe admirable pillars of all humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Philoſophers God ſhewed himſelf in his Omnipotency and juſtice, but ſeemed as it were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his mercy; to Chriſtians he ſhines in that which out-ſhines all his works, his Mercy: Oh, how ſhould we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his favours for ſo immenſe a benefit, wherein ſecluding himſelf from others, he hath wholly imparted himſelf to us!

Tis true, if we let our dimmed underſtanding ſearch in theſe varieties (which yet is the onely means that we have in our ſelves to do it with) we ſhall certainly loſe our ſelves in their windings; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every of them ſomething to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, above that reaſon that leads us to the ſearch: Reaſon gives us the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy of things, and illuſtrates with a great deal of plainneſs all the wayes that ſhe goes, but her line is too ſhort
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57224:95"/>
to reach the depth of Religion: Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion carries a confutation a long with it, &amp; with an high hand of Soveraignty, awes the inquiſitive tongue of nature, and when ſhe would ſometimes mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure privately, ſhe will not let her ſpeak: Reaſon like a milde Prince is content to ſhew his ſubjects the cauſes of his commands and rule; Religion with a higher ſtrain of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, bids do it, without inquiring further then the bare Command; which without doubt is a means of procuring mighty reverence: what we know not, we reverently admire; what do know, is in a ſort ſubject to the triumphs of the ſoul that hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it. And this not knowing makes us not able to judge; every one tels us, his own is the trueſt &amp; there is none I think, but hath been ſeal'd with the bloud of ſome; nor can <hi>I</hi> ſee, how we may more then probably prove any, they being all ſet in ſuch heights, as they are not ſubject to the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Reaſon; and as we may eaſier ſay what a ſoul is not then

what it is, ſo we may more eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove a Religion for falſe, then prove it for one that is true, there being in the world far more errors then truth; yet is there beſides another miſery, near as great as this, and that is, that we cannot be our own chuſers, but muſt take it upon truſt, from others.

Search all Religions the world through, and you ſhall find none that aſcribes ſo much to God, nor that conſtitutes ſo firm a love among men as does the eſtabliſhed doctrine of the <hi>Proteſtant Church among us,</hi> all other either detract from God, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the peace of men.

In other Religions of the Heathens, what fond opinions have they held of their Gods, reviling with unſeemly threats, when their affairs have thwarted them? as if allowing them the name, they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57224:97"/>
would conſerve the <hi>Numen</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: in their Sacrifices, how butcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cruel? as if (as tis ſaid of them) they thought by inhumanity, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the wrath of an offended Deity. The Religion which I profes, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all in another ſtrain: what makes more for Gods glory, what makes more for the mutual love of man, then the Goſpel? All our abilities of good we offer to God as the fountain from whence they ſtream; can the day be light, and that light not come from the Sun? can a clock go without a weight to move it, or a keeper to ſet it? As for man, it teaches ro tread on Cotton, milds his wilder temper, and learns him in his patience to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his enemies; and for that which doth partake of both, it makes juſt God, a friend to unjuſt man, without being unjuſt either to himſelf or man; ſure, it could be no other then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a Deity, to find out a way, how man that had made himſelf juſtly unhappy, ſhould, with a full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to exacteſt juſtice, be made again

moſt happy; as in <hi>Heydons</hi> book <hi>of the way to bliſs and happineſs</hi> you may read: I would wiſh no man that is able to try, to take his Religion upon others words; but once reſolved in it tis dangerous to neglect where you know you do owe a ſervice.</p>

It cannot but be beſt to give all to him, of whom whatſoever we have we hold. <hi>I</hi> believe it ſafeſt to take that Religion which moſt magnifies God, and makes moſt for the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able converſation of men; for as we

cannot aſcribe too much to him, to whom we owe more then we can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe, ſo I think the moſt ſplendid eſtate of man, is that which comes neareſt to his firſt creation, wherein all thing wrought together in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant embracements of mutuall love and concord.</p>
