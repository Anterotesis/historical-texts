         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Lord God hath committed the Authority of theſe Nation to you, and hath wonderfully overturned many, that you might again come up, and be tried, as he hath tried many before you, and they have been as chaff before the winde, and hath not anſwered the end for which the Lord intruſted them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did his diſpleaſure wax hot againſt them, for departing from him and looſing their way, in the dark in going about to root out that in the earth, and from amongſt them which had been their defence in time of trouble, and the Rock of their ſafety in their greateſt ſtraights; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not hearken to the Lords voice to chuſe his waies and walk therein, but grew hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin, ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lords warnings till he overturned them, that you might once more be tried; now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beware what you do, and tempt not God as they did, nor provoke not the Lord to wrath

Oh how is the ſpirit of the Lord hereby grieved, becauſe of theſe and other abominations? And how ſhamefully and barbarouſly have the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God ſuffered in this Nation of late years, becauſe they could not run with the world into all manner of exceſs and wickedneſs; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe they could not ſo much idolize mens perſons, and worſhip the beaſts Image, as was required of them? Therefore were they hailed, impriſoned, and grievouſly fined, and for other things accounted offences, where no known Law was broke, did they ſuffer as hainous tranſgreſſors, the like of which in ages paſt can ſcarcely be paralleld (and this from perſons who call themſelves Chriſtians.)
