            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the hedges with Muſquetiers, who were beaten out by our men like Sheepe: About 10 of the clock they began the fight.</p>
            <p>Then they gathered into a Body, (I meane the COR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISH) when our men did much execution upon them with their Ordinance, ſlew many men of note, among whom was Captaine <hi>Baſſet</hi> of <hi>Silley,</hi> and beat them home to the walls: but they having two Regiments of freſh Men come into their ſupply, though our men fought very valiantly and kept their ground, they with their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes had almoſt ſurrounded them, and plaid upon them on every ſide, whereat our men began to be diſmayed, and about 400. ſhranke away fr<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Horſe fetching off a great Gunne, which was in danger, which worke was refuſed by Major <hi>Price</hi> an old Souldier, who had command to doe it, but he refuſed, ſaying, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; yet it was brought off by him, and all their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, ſo that they loſt nothing they had; about ſeven Men ſlaine, who were brought off alſo with about 40. hurt men, they kil'd above 100.

Thus GOD wrought for us, and fought for us at that time: our men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated that night to <hi>Liſtan,</hi> but becauſe they could not quarter there with conveniency and ſafetie, on <hi>Munday</hi> they Marched to <hi>Okeington,</hi> there to Quarter.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday the <hi>Corniſh</hi> with 5000. Foote and 500.

Horſe gave the Charge, and Routed their Horſe, who ſoone broke the Rankes of their Foote; and the reſt of our Horſe following the Charge very cloſe, broke through their whole Army and killed many, doing exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution forward and backward, and thus they did twice, and forced the enemies to flie in much confuſion, onely there was a ſmall body that kept together and guarded

their Ordnance, which was once taken, but at length carried away by their own guard, which our men could not force, they reſted not running untill they came to <hi>Lanceſton:</hi> Thus God himſelfe alone got the Victory: they loſt 500. Armes, which our men got, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try next morning had the gleaning of much more; our men broke a multitude of their Pikes, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not worth the carrying away: there were taken 12 Priſoners, two foote Colours, one Coronet, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which was Sir <hi>Nicholas Slannings,</hi> 13 Drums; Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> had his Head-piece taken from him, and was almoſt chokt therby, begg'd for his life, and ſo eſcaped unknowne, but very narrowly: The Lord <hi>Moone</hi> was taken and pillaged: but egreneſſe to get more plunder, cauſed the Trooper that took him, after he had his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to let him eſcape, it being ſo darke indeed that one could hardly diſcern another: It is ſuppoſed that Sir <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Slanning</hi> was pillaged alſo.</p>
            <p>Many of the Troopers have gotten good ſtore of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Pillage; an Iriſh man weares the Lord <hi>Moones</hi> Cloake. There were ſlain above 100. upon the place. In all this fight we loſt not one man, though there were about 12. hurt, not above 2. that are dangerous. When our men gave the laſt charge, it being about 12. of the clock, it came to extream weather, Lightning and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and much Raine, which beat into the enemies face, having neither hedge nor ditch; it ſtroke much terror in to them, that ſome among them that had better diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions then the reſt, betook themſelves to Prayer, and ſaid, That <hi>now they ſaw that the Lord did fight againſt them.</hi> It is ſuppoſed that the moſt of them are ſpoyled, for ever being Souldiers againe, for they marched before they reſted (beſides the time they fought, without having meat or drinke) above 30. miles.

For his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to us at <hi>Keynton field,</hi> who by two Regiments Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and put to ſlight the Kings Army. At <hi>Brainford,</hi> who by two broken Regiments kept back and incountered with the Kings whole Army. At <hi>Bradford,</hi> who by about 60. men overcame a great Army that came againſt them. At <hi>Chicheſter</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> delivering thoſe places into the hands of our Army, though greatly oppoſed. At <hi>Middlewich,</hi> for the great Victory given there to Sir <hi>Will: Brereton.</hi> At <hi>Salt Heath</hi> neere <hi>Stafford;</hi> for his good hand with his people in <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi> For the good ſucceſſe of Sir <hi>William Waller:</hi> and alſo of my Lord <hi>Fairefax;</hi> for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Servants ſo ſtrangely at <hi>Lichfield-Cloſe.</hi> I ſay, nor theſe, nor any of the mercies of God ought to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, but thankfully remembred; and in eſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we ought to be thankfull for the wonderfull worke of God wrought for his Servants in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the Letter before ſpecified.</p>
