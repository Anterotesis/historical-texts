            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>POlicy,</hi> truly ſo call'd, is, <hi>The Art of governing a Multitude wiſely,</hi> which is beſt done by ruling <hi>according to their own Inclinations,</hi> for then they will obey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reluctancy; and their Inclinations being bent to their own Good, which conſiſts in <hi>Plenty</hi> of all Temporal Commodities, (and eſpecially of Money, which purchaſes all the reſt;) and in <hi>Peace,</hi> which ſecures to them the enjoyment of what they already poſſeſs, (which <hi>Two</hi> make up that which we call the <hi>Common Good,</hi> and by the effects make the People ſee they do ſo,) is the <hi>only true Government,</hi> and only likely to be <hi>durable;</hi> and they who govern thus are the <hi>only wiſe,</hi> that is the only <hi>true Politicians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the abuſe of any thing is altering the meaning of the Word to a ſiniſter Senſe; hence thoſe Men who neglect this natural method of governing, and do really over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen, impoveriſh, and haraſs the People, and inſtead of eaſing, and enriching them, make uſe of Quirks, and Tricks to bubble them, that either they may not <hi>ſee</hi> it, or not lay it to Heart, have gain'd alſo the Name of <hi>Politicians;</hi> tho' they have no more right to it than a <hi>Mountebank,</hi> who neglects Nature, and makes uſe of Quacking Language, odd Geſtures, and Tricks, (not to benefit his Patients but to get their Money,) deſerves to be reputed a good <hi>Phyſician.</hi> The People ſhould be made ſenſible by real effects of the Peace, and Plenty, the Governours have bleſt them with, and not be fool'd with <hi>airy Words,</hi> or lull'd with pleaſing Dreams that they ſhall be happy and rich God knows <hi>when</hi> or <hi>how;</hi> not reflecting that while they thus loll on ſluggiſhly in the Contemplation of this Viſionary Felicity, the Robber is actually in their Houſes plundering them of all their real Poſſeſſions. Such a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment then being <hi>againſt Nature,</hi> it's the greateſt Miracle in <hi>Nature</hi> if it laſts long, or indeed any longer than till their Feeling and Experience open the Peoples Eyes, to ſee through the blinding Miſt that was caſt before them.</p>
            <p>Many are the Stratagems and Tricks our Quack-Politicians make uſe of, but none of ſuch univerſal uſefulneſs as the Myſterious Art of <hi>Plot-Forging:</hi> For the horrid Noiſe of a <hi>Plot</hi> entertains the Peoples preſent Thoughts with its Novelty, and their future ones with the expectation of its Diſcovery; ſo that they have not the leiſure to mind their own Concern, or to reflect how the <hi>Common Good</hi> goes to wreck. It frights the Vulgar with the hideous <hi>Idea</hi> of an Enemy lying in Ambuſh, which, they having the Dreſs in their Hands, and power to make any Fiction paſs uncontroll'd; is eaſily improved into a Conſpiracy to cut all their Throats; and ſo ſet all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a madding. It enhances the Credit and Awfulneſs of the Governours as <hi>wondrous wiſe Men,</hi> in that the moſt ſecret Practiſes lie open to their ſearching Eye, and exact Intelligence. It fifts the Honeſt Party, who love Truth more than Tricks, from thoſe of their own Faction, and either expoſes them to certain Obloquy and Ruine,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63237:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if they offer to contradict the manifeſt Forgery; or if they do not, then it makes the Plot-Fiction authentick, becauſe it paſſes <hi>uncontroll'd.</hi> It breeds a horrible Cry againſt thoſe at whoſe Doors the Plot Framers think fit to lay their own Brat, and 'tis an excellent Gin to entrap thoſe who are obnoxious to the Courtiers, either for their Honeſty, or the rich Prey of their Money. It fixes their unthinking credulous and affrighted Bigots more firmly to their Devotion. It countenances, by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Neceſſity, the bold licentionſneſs of clapping up <hi>cauſeleſly,</hi> and <hi>lawleſly,</hi> whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they pleaſe in Priſon; and how ſlight a pretence will ſerve, their Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards divers Peers, and others laſt Year has ſhown us. It makes the Commons more pliable to be let Blood in the Silver-Vein, even to the laſt Ounce, to be ſecured (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) againſt ſuch formidable or rather fantaſtical Contrivances. Laſtly, 'Tis the moſt direct method for a Governour, whoſe Ambition tranſports him to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>abſolute,</hi> by ſetting up a <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> or what other he pleaſes to carry through his haughty Deſigns; for it gives him both an occaſion, and a colour to ſtrengthen his own intereſted Party to that Predominancy of Power, that all the reſt of the Nation muſt be forced to truckle whenever he ſees ſit to attempt it, or pleaſes to lift up his Foot to tread upon their Necks.</p>
            <p>Our Government, while the Revolution was a Novelty, and the Kingdom in an ill-humour, did not indeed ſtand in need of any <hi>new Plots,</hi> it ſelf being every bit a meer continued <hi>Plot,</hi> carried on by Forgeries, and ſhamming Deluſions of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but now that the Nation is ſenſible of their Folly, and ſees that all thoſe gay, and hollow Pretences end in a flat Cheat of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and other <hi>Confederates,</hi> to gull ſilly <hi>England,</hi> at the expence of their Blood and Treaſure to maintain <hi>their War;</hi> that better half of the Nation (if they dare ſpeak out) do hate the Proceedings of the Court-Party; nay, that the whole Nation repines at the dearneſs of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, ſcarcity of Money, damp of Trade, and inſupportable Taxes: Our new Government is put to its Shifts, and Plots are now become abſolutely neceſſary, and an eſſential part of our <hi>Mountebank-Policy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then out ſteps <hi>Fuller,</hi> patronized by my good Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with Plots in his Budget to ſell by Whole-ſale; nay, he flew ſo high, that he threatned to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach divers of the Houſe of Commons, as if he ſhould tell them, <hi>Look to your ſelves, Gentlemen; for whoever oppoſes the voting Money enough, I'll all-to-be-Traytor him.</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, like a true Chymiſt, he got before-hand, which he ſpent proſuſely in <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Bawdry:</hi> But that was no Rub in the Caſe, the more Rogue he was, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was qualified for a Plot-Witneſs. The true Patriots in the Houſe of Commons not knowing on which of them the Plot might light, and reſenting to be over-aw'd by Court Tricks, got the Cognizance of it to be brought before them; but <hi>Fuller</hi> directed them to a wrong Lodging, and himſelf diſapp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ared: Whereupon he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tigmatized by their Votes for an <hi>unpardonable Cheat, &amp;c.</hi> and ordered to be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, though he came off with a ſlight Puniſhment for ſo great a Crime. And ſo this <hi>Archiepiſcopal-Plot</hi> fell to the ground, and, like that of the noble <hi>Salamanca Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> went out in a ſtink.</p>
            <p>But the next <hi>Plot</hi> was more hopeful, being to be performed by a greater Maſter in the <hi>Cheating-Trade,</hi> the Infamous Villain <hi>Young;</hi> for his counterfeiting Hands ſo dextrouſly was alone as good as half a Teſtimony; we cannot doubt but that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63237:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(Money being his only aim) he was to be well paid by the <hi>Old Plot-Forger:</hi> But the <hi>Plot</hi> was by Providence detected, and the Falſhood of it ſo induſtriouſly diſcovered by the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> it prov'd Abortive; which had it taken had coſt the Life of many an Honeſt Man. Our Court hop'd that if diſcovered it would paſs ſor one of <hi>Young</hi>'s Knavi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h Pranks; but the World is not ſo ſtupid as they imagine: For <hi>Young,</hi> and his Comrade <hi>Blackhead,</hi> lying in <hi>Newgate</hi> ſor Debt, and living on others Scraps, without a Penny or a Friend to help them, Who were thoſe that came in a Coach to a <hi>Tavern</hi> near hand, and ſent for them out divers times? Who was it paid their Debts, and Fees, and fetch'd them out, put good ſtore of Money in their Pockets, and good Cloaths on their Backs, a little before they began their <hi>Plotting-Trade?</hi> And why was the enquiry into thoſe particulars, though ſo much preſt by divers worthy Perſons, ſo induſtriouſly waved even to this time? This was too tender a point for the Biſhop to meddle with, who in all likelyhood ſuſpected the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and is a great flaw in his Book: So that no Man of Senſe, when things are thus carried, but ſmells an old Fox, though they dare not put him up and hunt him, for fear of being indicted for ſpoiling the King's Game, and a greater Wheel moving the leſſer ones.</p>
            <p>So fond they are of <hi>Plots,</hi> that my L. <hi>Nottingham</hi> himſelf, whoſe Noſe, as it ſeems, was more ſagacious and reach'd farther than his Underſtanding, ſmelt out a <hi>Plot</hi> the laſt Summer; and thereupon (which was one of his bold ſtrokes to daſh out the Laws) he gave out Warrants to ſeize, and impriſon divers <hi>Peers,</hi> and other Perſons of <hi>Quality,</hi> without the leaſt Evidence againſt them <hi>then,</hi> or <hi>ſince:</hi> Some of them, to avoid Vexation and Charge, had kept themſelves private; whereupon a very pleaſant <hi>Female-Proclamation</hi> was iſſued to apprehend them, branding them publickly to the whole Nation as guilty Perſons who had <hi>fled from Juſtice;</hi> whereas 'tis now evident, that had the Court had the leaſt colour of Juſtice againſt any of them, the utmoſt Severity of it had been inflicted on them without Mercy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as ſoon as this <hi>ſlanderous Proclamation</hi> had cryed <hi>Hoo-loo,</hi> the State-Hounds, led by my L. <hi>Lucas,</hi> who thought it a great Honour to become a <hi>Catch-Pole</hi> in ſuch a Legal Employ, hunted them dry-foot, and took divers of them, not dangerouſly <hi>Plotting,</hi> but very quietly <hi>Napping:</hi> But when they had them, they had nothing in the World to ſay to them, but only that they were reſolved, in deſpight of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>the Laws,</hi> and the <hi>Priviledge</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> to boot, to put them to as much Trouble and Vexation as they could. Theſe unwarrantable Warrants were highly reſented in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> and Satisfaction demanded from my L. <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and his Lawyers, for violating ſo notoriouſly the <hi>Liberty of the Subject:</hi> But the Court-Party (a Fault which no doubt they will amend for the future) being, by ill-hap, unſurniſhed of <hi>King's-Evidences</hi> to ſwear <hi>Plots</hi> falſly againſt them, ſtick'd hard to get them indemnified; and ſo the <hi>Plot</hi> light to be on the other ſide, <hi>viz.</hi> to enure the Nation to <hi>Slavery,</hi> and make it to endure the breach of our moſt <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> that concern the Subject's Liberty; that ſo it may be no wonder hereafter if the <hi>Court</hi> play them the ſame foul play <hi>in the like</hi> or other Caſes, in regard there was ſuch a ſignal Precedent for it ſo powerfully abetted, and protected. And thus our Noble <hi>Law breakers</hi> came off with Impunity, and Honour too; for what is damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Eye of the Law is meritorious in the ſight of the Court. How can the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63237:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
State with Juſtice hang <hi>Robbers,</hi> and ſuch like Malefactors, when thoſe Men eſcape <hi>Scotfree</hi> who rob free-born <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> of their <hi>Liberty,</hi> which is more valuable than their Money, unleſs our Laws be made of <hi>Cobwebs,</hi> which catch only the leſſer Flies, and let the great ones break through and eſcape.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Plot</hi> begins already to bud forth in our two late <hi>Proclamations: Blank Warrants,</hi> Sign'd in likelyhood by themſelves, muſt be laid up fooliſhly, and found miraculouſly, and then comes out a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> complaining ſadly and ſeriouſly that my L. <hi>Not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ingham</hi>'s <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi> were forged by the diſaffected, forbidding all <hi>Warrants</hi> with the Old Seal to be of any effect, and promiſing a <hi>New Seal,</hi> and Jaſtly offering <hi>five hundred Pounds</hi> to the Diſcoverers; and then (to make it more credible, and fill the Heads of the Nation with Proclamations,) a <hi>Second Thought Proclamation</hi> follows upon the Neck of the former, offering <hi>five hundred Pounds,</hi> and <hi>Indemnity</hi> beſides to any even of the <hi>Contrivers,</hi> if they will but diſcover their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices. Now the Devil muſt be an arrant Aſs, if he have not one Rogue of his in all <hi>England,</hi> who (as <hi>Bedlow</hi> upon the ſelf-ſame account found himſelf Guilty of the Murder of Sir<hi>—Godfry,)</hi> will not take the Money when he may come in ſo ſafely, and accuſe ſome-body or other falſly, by which means my Lord's Credit will be cleared, and a new <hi>Plot</hi> made; and doubtleſs it's now hammering upon the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Yet for all the Art and Wit this Stratagem makes a ſhew of, any Man with half an Eye may ſee 'tis but a very <hi>botching</hi> and <hi>bungling</hi> piece of Policy: For why could not the Forgers of the <hi>Old Seal,</hi> (had there been any ſuch,) as well counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the <hi>New Seal</hi> too, when it came out, and ſo fruſtrate all the Ends pretended to by the <hi>Proclamation.</hi> However, 'tis ſome happineſs that we are ſafe from being Gaol-Birds till the <hi>New Seal</hi> be made; which is to inherit the illegal power of the <hi>Old One,</hi> only we ſhall have the comfort to be impriſoned with a better Grace; that is, by Warrants of a later Edition, with the noble Formality of a New Seal. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Nation had been better ſatisfied, had a <hi>Proclamation</hi> told us ſuch unlawful Practices ſhould be uſed no more; whereas this accuſes every Body, and ſatisfies no Body.</p>
            <p>Theſe Plunges the Court-Party are put to, that they may tyrannize over the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> and yet give their Actions a Face of <hi>Legality;</hi> which, together with their defeat in <hi>Fuller</hi> and <hi>Young,</hi> make every Man ſee clearly that they ſtand in huge need of a <hi>Plot,</hi> and of <hi>King's-Evidences</hi> to countenance and juſtifie their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. But where muſt ſuch Fellows be found? The arranteſt Rogues, whom their Crimes have coop'd up in <hi>Gaols,</hi> are fitteſt for Perjury, and eſpecially if they might eſcape Hanging by it, then, to be ſure, they would ſwear heartily and luſtily to whatever the great Ones ſhould inſpire them with, upon pretence of <hi>Reprieve,</hi> or <hi>Pardon.</hi> Now it light very Providentially, (as they imagined,) that the Arch-Robber <hi>Whitney</hi> happ'd to be in <hi>Young</hi>'s Neſt, who was flown, <hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>Newgate;</hi> and withal condemned to be hanged: To him they apply, being well allured that they neeeded not lay long Siege to his Honeſty, if he might but hope for a Pardon. The Method they took was this: Firſt, Capt. <hi>Richardſon</hi> tells him he muſt certainly dye without any hopes of Mercy; then, to relieve his Deſpair, come ſome honeſt <hi>Williamites</hi> to him, as Sir <hi>John Auſtin, Dutton Colt,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Dutton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Pope Blount,</hi> ſome of whom treated with him about making a <hi>Plot;</hi> and it ſo concerted, that he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63237:3"/>
ſhould ſay, (and by conſequence <hi>ſwear</hi> if need be,) that the Lords <hi>Litchfield, Ayleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Salisbury,</hi> and <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and ſome others whoſe Names I have not, had trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, by their Agents, to aſſemble his Gang of <hi>Robbers,</hi> and <hi>kill</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> as he was hunting in <hi>Epping,</hi> or <hi>Windſor</hi> Forreſt, promiſing him vaſt Rewards when his work was done. But whom ſhould he name for thoſe Agents? <hi>Whitney</hi>'s Houſe was at <hi>Cheſton</hi> in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> where lived on Dr. <hi>Thorowgood,</hi> his Countreyman, and Neighbour, who meeting him ſometimes in <hi>London,</hi> they went to drink at the Houſe of one Mr. <hi>Burchil,</hi> at the Queens head in <hi>White-Swan-yard,</hi> over againſt <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> having in their Company one Mr. <hi>Pike, Thorowgood</hi>'s Friend, and conſtant Aſſociate. They had done this twice or thrice, and ſo <hi>Whitney</hi> judg'd thoſe the fitteſt Perſons that could be pretended to have treated with him, and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chil</hi> the propereſt Man to witneſs that Treaty. This Project amounting to a <hi>rough-draught</hi> of the <hi>Plot</hi> thus cunningly laid, ſo that now nothing but dextrous managing the Perſons was wanting; a Paper was carried to my L. <hi>Nottingham</hi> with the Names of the Lords, as principal Movers, and of <hi>Thorowgood</hi> and <hi>Pike,</hi> as the immediate <hi>Treaters</hi> and <hi>Interveners:</hi> This got <hi>Whitney</hi> his <hi>Reprieve;</hi> and Warrants were ſent to take up <hi>Thorowgood</hi> and <hi>Pike,</hi> who getting Light of the Deſign, and not willing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be Knaves voluntary, nor tortured, (by the uſual mercileſs Severities exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in Priſons ſince the erection of this New Government,) or perhaps hanged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not be ſo, kept out of the way. The firſt thing to be done was to work upon Mr. <hi>Burchil,</hi> and to bring this about, a Dragooner, by Name <hi>Bowes,</hi> comes to his Houſe, and tells him he was going to <hi>Whitney</hi> in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and that he would do a Friendly Office to go along with him, and give him a Viſit: The honeſt Man, little dreaming what a Trap was laid for him, went with him very civilly. <hi>Whitney</hi> ſeemed very glad to ſee him, and after a while began to put it upon him, that he knew and heard Dr. <hi>Thorowgood</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pike</hi> treat with him about killing the <hi>King,</hi> and that if he would but witneſs it, it would be a means to ſave his Life, and alſo be highly advantageous to himſelf. <hi>Burchil</hi> replyed, that he did never in his Life know or hear any ſuch thing, and ſo could not in Conſcience aſſert it. After <hi>Whitney</hi> had plyed him with all the moſt preſſing Intreaties, and high-promiſing Motives uſual in ſuch a caſe, and ſaw there was no hope of making him a Villain by <hi>Fair-means,</hi> then (as the method of <hi>Plot-Forging</hi> required,) he was to try what might be done by <hi>Foul;</hi> wherefore he began to ſpeak very loud, to threaten him highly, and to abuſe him with opprobrious Language for refuſing to witneſs ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Truth. This loudneſs of his was the <hi>Watch-word</hi> for <hi>Tucker</hi> to come in, who had placed himſelf on purpoſe at a convenient diſtance, and knew his <hi>Cue</hi> when he was to act in this intended <hi>real Tragedy,</hi> fell upon <hi>Burchil</hi> with bitter Invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, hunching him rudely with his Elbowes, and telling him he would be hanged, and all he had ſeized on for the King, if he refuſed to witneſs what <hi>Whitney</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; and in concluſion, like a true Servant and Imitator of my L. <hi>Nottingham,</hi> without Law, and in diſpite of it, clapp'd him up and made him Priſoner. The poor Man lay there about three Hours with an aking Heart, fearing he ſhould be made paſs through <hi>Prance</hi>'s Purgatory, and be tortured for not yeilding to atteſt a Falſhood. By that time they hop'd that the Fright for what he had ſuffered at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and his apprehenſion of worſe, would have daunted and warp'd his Honeſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:63237:4"/>
               <hi>Tucker</hi> and <hi>Bowes</hi> came to him with a <hi>Paper Signed</hi> by <hi>Whitney,</hi> containing all the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars he would have him ſwear, which they ſhewed him, promiſing that if he would ſubſcribe it, he ſhould immediately be ſet free, and richly gratified in to the Bargain. What ſhould he do? No Friend could come at him that he might acquaint them with his Condition; and he feared that ſhould he refuſe, Torture would come next, and pehaps that <hi>Tucker</hi> and <hi>Bowes,</hi> who he ſaw were Confederates, might ſwear falſe againſt him if he perſiſted in his Reſolution: Wherefore to get free from the Clutches of theſe <hi>Harpies,</hi> (never intending to ſtand to it,) he Signs the <hi>Paper,</hi> after he had capitulated with <hi>Whitney</hi> to give it him under his Hand to indemnifie him, which he did, and <hi>(Bowes</hi> and <hi>Tucker</hi> preſent) fubſcribed a Paper to that purpoſe, which <hi>Burchil</hi> has yet by him. And now the Plot went merrily on, and began to look very Towardly. They aſſured themſelves now of <hi>Burchil,</hi> who was freed and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. The Paper was ſent to the over-joyed <hi>Secretary;</hi> ſome ſay that <hi>Whitney</hi> was examined by him too, or by ſome from him; but 'tis certain, Orders were given to my Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice Holt,</hi> to examine <hi>Burchil,</hi> who ſent a <hi>Tip-ſtaff,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by <hi>Bowes,</hi> at ten a Clock at Night the ſame Day to bring <hi>Burchil</hi> before him; who, as they were going, ſpent many Exhortations and Encouragements upon him, to make him ſtand ſtiff to his Subſcription. Being come before my Lord, <hi>Bowes</hi> took his Oath he ſaw him ſign it; and upon my Lord's asking him, <hi>Burchil</hi> frankly acknowledged it was his Hand. Then, ſays my Lord, you can ſwear to the Contents of the <hi>Paper.</hi> No, my Lord, replyed Mr. <hi>Burchil, I cannot ſwear it,</hi> for <hi>there is never a word of Truth in it;</hi> laying open in order how he had been treated with Careſſes, and rough Uſage to induce him to ſwear a Falſhood, and that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Signed it out of <hi>Fear,</hi> and that he might free himſelf out of their Claws, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhould have been worſe uſed, had he continued there, and refuſed it. Upon which, my Lord, (who I hear has had a little Taſte of <hi>Arbitrary Court-Tricks,)</hi> did very worthily free <hi>Burchil,</hi> and gave order immediately to hang <hi>VVhitney.</hi> And ſo <hi>this horrid Damnable Helliſh VVilliamite Plot,</hi> through the Prudence and Sincerity of this one Honeſt Man, very luckily came to nothing, and the growing Noiſe of it ſpread by the <hi>Court-Party</hi> was quaſh'd, and ſuddenly huſh'd; which, had it taken, it had been a bleſſed time for <hi>Hangmen,</hi> and Gaolors, and Executioners, for we ſhould have ſeen e're long the Heads of thoſe Honourable, and Innocent Perſonages fly off at <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> and Multitudes of others impriſoned, ruined in their Eſtates, and put to Death: It being much eaſier to <hi>improve</hi> a <hi>Plot,</hi> when Statiſts think they have got Ground enough, with Safety to their Credits, to own it, than it is to make it take at firſt, the Foundation of all ſuch fictitious Contrivances being ſo <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady,</hi> and rotten.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Courtiers,</hi> having loſt the advantage of carrying their <hi>Plot</hi> on, reſolved now to make their advantage of its Miſcarriage, by crying up their own Integrity and Honeſty in freeing <hi>Burchil,</hi> and hanging <hi>VVhitney,</hi> (though neither of them was more than what the Law required;) that ſo, by preſerving their Credit, as to <hi>this Plot,</hi> which they ſaw <hi>would not take,</hi> they might be the better believed in future Ones, which they hoped <hi>would take;</hi> but we may thank the <hi>Ill Succeſs,</hi> and not ſome Men's <hi>Good VVill:</hi> For 'tis manifeſt from every Circumſtance, that while they had hopes it would come to ſomething they abetted it, as much as ever they could, without
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63237:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
telling the World openly they were the Original Contrivers of it, which being ſuch a deep, and ſo ſacred a Myſtery of State, ought not to be revealed to the profane Eyes of the Vulgar, or ſearched into too narrowly: For, who was it that ſent <hi>VVhitney</hi>'s firſt Paper to my Lord <hi>Nottingham?</hi> And why were Warrants immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately iſſued to take <hi>Thorowgood</hi> and <hi>Pike,</hi> ſince the Information, coming only from a Condemned Man, who was never in his Life of any Credit, and would ſay any thing to ſave his Life, could ſignifie nothing? Who was it that got him a Reprieve? Who ſent <hi>Bowes</hi> ſo ſeaſonably to Mr. <hi>Burchil,</hi> who was the only Man that could aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his Pretence in witneſſing againſt <hi>Thorowgood</hi> and <hi>Pike?</hi> How came it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that a <hi>Plot</hi> was Forging by all the Perſons who were in the neareſt Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces while it was contriving? Who hired <hi>Tucker</hi> to join with <hi>VVhitney</hi> in reviling and threatning him, becauſe he would not be perjured, and to clap him up ſo rudely and illegally? Would ſuch a Fellow do ſuch an action, which might loſe him his Place, and make him to be ſoundly puniſhed beſides, unleſs he had been bribed, or powerfully ſollicited to it? Or durſt he have done it, unleſs ſome Great Perſons had aſſured him beſore-hand of Impunity? And if not, Why is he not ſeverely puniſhed for it ſince, but ſtill continued in his Employment; ſince it will not be ſafe for any Man to viſit his Friend in Priſon, if ſuch villainous Tricks be permitted? Indeed my Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> was angry with him, and ſaid he deſerved to loſe it; but he thought it not fit to procced farther, leaſt it might offend ſome to whom he was to be upon occaſion a very uſeful Inſtrument. Who was to have got <hi>VVhitney</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which he was ſure of, and upon the Proſpect of which he began this Jigg? Why did the Honeſteſt of them fall off, and proteſt <hi>he would have no Hand in Plots?</hi> Why did the two <hi>Plot-makers</hi> (one of them eſpecially) go above a dozen times to <hi>VVhitney</hi> in <hi>Newgate,</hi> with whom they had no Acquaintance?
