            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Saints:</hi> and One for the <hi>Dead.</hi>

            <p>Each Office has four Parts; <hi>Matins</hi>
and <hi>Lauds,</hi> for the Morning. <hi>Vefpers</hi>
and <hi>Complin,</hi> for the Evening.</p>
            <p>The manner of reciting theſe Offices.</p>
            <p>When one ſays his Pray'rs alone, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
are free to be govern'd by his

'tis convenient they agree on ſome Rules:

                  <hi>FIrſt,</hi> Both ſtand a while, to make the
Preſence of God, and implore his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance;
either without ſet form of words;
or with the Pray'r, <hi>Prevent we beſeech
Thee,</hi> &amp;c. ſecretly.</p>
               <p>Then Both make the ſign of the Croſs,
and ſay,</p>
               <p>In the Name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the H. Ghoſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Both joyning their hands before their

Trinity, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Thus far ſecretly.</p>
               <p>Then Both riſe, and ſtanding, <hi>A.</hi> ſays
with an audible voice,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Lord open thou our lips.</hi> (Saying

               <p>Then, Both standing, <hi>A.</hi> ſays the Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.

<hi>A.</hi> ſays, <hi>Glory be.</hi> B. <hi>As it was. A.</hi> ſays

               </p>
               <p>Then One ſays the <hi>Antiphon:</hi> The Other

Fire and water he has ſet before thee; ſtretch

                     <p>HAve confidence in our Lord with all thy

in all thy ways think on Him, and he will direct
thy ſteps. Be not wiſe in thine own conceit: fear
God, and depart from evil. The greater thou
art, ſo much the more humble thy ſelf; and
thou ſhalt find grace before God: for, the power
of God only is great, and he is honor'd of the
humble. Seek not the things that are too high
for thee; nor ſearch into thoſe that are
above thy ſtrength: but the things which God
has commanded thee, think always on them, and
in many of his works be not curious; ſince 'tis
not neceſſary for thee to ſee with thine eys thoſe
things that are hidden. Place thy treaſure in the

precepts of the Higheſt, and it ſhall profit thee
more then gold. Lay up thy alms in the hart
of the poor, and it ſhall obtain for thee againſt

above the ſpear, it ſhall fight againſt the enemy.
In all thy gifts ſhew a chearful countenance, and
dedicate thy tyths with gladneſs: give to the
Higheſt, according to what He has given thee;
and with a good ey do according to the ability
of thy hands; for our Lord is thy rewarder,
and he will repay thee ſeven times as much.
When the ways of a man pleaſe our Lord, he
will convert even his enemys to peace. The hart
of a man diſpoſes his way; but it pertains to
our Lord to direct his ſteps. He that is patient
is better then the ſtrong; and he that rules over
his mind, then the Conqueror of Cities. There

You who fear our Lord, hope in him; and

                     <p>THe fear of our Lord is the begining of
wiſdom. If ſinners intice thee, conſent
not to them; if they ſay come with us, walk
not with them: for their feet run to evil and
make haſt to ſhed blood; nay, themſelvs ly in
wait even againſt their own blood, and practiſe
deceits againſt their own ſouls. They have hated
diſcipline, and not receiv'd the fear of our Lord:
therefore ſhall they eat the fruits of their way,
and be fill'd with their own counſels. The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of our Lord is on the head of the juſt; but
iniquity covers the mouth of the impious. The
memory of the juſt is with praiſes; but the
name of the wicked ſhall rot. He that walks
ſincerely walks confidently; but he that goes
crooked ways ſhall be made manifeſt. He that
digs a pit ſhall fall into it; and he that lays a

and he not know whence it comes. He that will
be reveng'd ſhall find vengeance of our Lord;

wicked fears ſhall come upon him; and to the

God is a ſure revenger. Say not, I have ſin'd,

                     <p>CHriſt loved his Church, and gave himſelf
for it; that he might ſanctify it, cleanſing
it by the Laver of water, in the word of life;
that he might preſent to himſelf a glorious
Church: not having ſpot or wrinckle: And he
gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and
ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors, and Doctors:
for the conſummation of the Saints, for the
work of the miniſtry, for the edifying the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Chriſt; til we all meet into the unity and
knowledge of the Son of God, into a perfect
man, into the meaſure of the age of the fulnes
of Chriſt: That henceforth we be not children,
wavering, and carry'd about with every wind of
doctrine, by the wickednes of men, and their
craftines to circumvent into error; but follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the truth in charity, let us in all things
grow in him, who is our head, Chriſt. And
I beſeech you, Brethren, by the name of our
Lord JESUS Chriſt, that you all ſay one thing,
and that there be no ſchiſms among you; but
that you be perfect in one ſenſe, and in one
knowledge. Mark them that make diſſentions
and ſcandals, contrary to the Doctrin which
you have learn't, and avoyd them: for ſuch
ſerve not Chriſt our Lord, but their own belly;
and by ſweet ſpeeches and benedictions ſeduce
the harts of the ſimple. Beleeve not every ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44586:107"/>
but prove the ſpirits whether they be of
God; for many falſe Prophets are gone out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world: Therefore, Brethren, ſtand faſt,
hold the traditions which you have learn'd,
whether by word of mouth, or our Epiſtle.
Obey your Prelats, and be ſubject to them; for
they watch, as being to render account for your
ſouls.</p>
                     <p>R. My God, if ravenous Wolvs ſeek by force
to devour me, and with threats and penalty's
fright me from thy Faith; this ſhal be my
ſhield againſt all their fiery darts, * I beleeve
my Creed, and, in it, One holy Catholick and
Apoſtolick Church. If ſubtle foxes ſeek by
fraud to deceive me, and with wit and fallacy's

many ſins, and thankfully admiring his infinite

                  <p>Let us wean our minds from unbecoming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,

and alms, our prayers may mount up more
ſwiftly to heav'n.</p>
                  <p>Come let's adore our God that redeem'd us.</p>
                  <p>Glory be to the Father, &amp;c.</p>

and mildly ſtoopt to his humble task:</p>
                  <p>When he might have flown on the wings of

heav'n; in the ſweat of his brows he would eat
his bread:</p>
                  <p>When he might have made the Angels his

Parents:</p>
                  <p>Living with Them in their litle cottage; and
readily obeying even their leaſt command:</p>
                  <p>There, in that humble privacy, He increaſt in

* was to fix our love on the world to come.</p>
                  <p>This therefore was his great intent; and in
this concentred all his merits:</p>
                  <p>To change the byaſs of our wrong-ſet harts,
by eſtabliſhing among us new motives of
charity:</p>
                  <p>Such as might ſtrongly incline our affections:
and efficaciouſly draw us to love our true Good:</p>
                  <p>Such as might gain by degrees upon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
and render ſalvation eaſie and univerſal:</p>
                  <p>For this, he came down from his Fathers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
* to teach us the Rules of eternal life:</p>
                  <p>That we might firmly believe thoſe ſacred
truths, * which God himſelf with his own
mouth had told us:</p>
                  <p>For this, he converſt ſo long on our earth,
* to encourage and provoke us by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:</p>
                  <p>That he might confidently imbrace thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:44586:180"/>
vertues; * which God himſelf in
his own Perſon had practis'd:</p>
                  <p>For this, he endur'd thoſe ſharp and many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions;
and became at laſt obedient even to
death:</p>
                  <p>That we might patiently ſuffer whatever
ſhould befal us, * when God himſelf was ſo
treated by his creatures.</p>
                  <p>For this, he ſo often preacht of the joys of
heav'n; and ſet them before us in ſo clear a
light:</p>
                  <p>That ſeeing ſo rich a prize hang at the race's
end, we might run and ſtrain our utmoſt force
to gain it:</p>
                  <p>For this, he ordain'd the Myſterys of grace;
and left us a Sacrifice made all of miracles:</p>
                  <p>That he might breed and nouriſh in us the life
of charity; and raviſh our harts with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of his preſence.</p>
                  <p>For this, he eſtabliſht a perpetual Church;
and ſent the holy Ghoſt to inſpire and govern it:</p>
                  <p>That it might flouriſh for ever in truth and
ſanctity; and plant the ſame heav'nly ſeed over
all the world.</p>
                  <p>For this, he aſſum'd thoſe ſtrange endearing
names * of friend, and brother, and ſpouſe to us
wretches:</p>
                  <p>Doing far more for us then all thoſe names
import, * then all our harts can wiſh.</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed, O glorious JESU, be the wiſdom of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:44586:180"/>
thy mercy, * that has found ſo ſweet and ſhort
away to ſave us.</p>
                  <p>Thou art, O Lord, the cauſe of our love; and
love the cauſe of our happineſs:</p>
                  <p>By love we fulfil all thy commands; and by
making us love, Thou fulfil'dſt all thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's:</p>
                  <p>By love we are reconcil'd from enemys to
friends; by love we are tranſlated from death
to life:</p>
                  <p>By love we are deliver'd from the fear of
hell; by love we are adopted to be heirs of
heav'n:</p>
                  <p>By love we are diſpos'd for that blysful Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
by love we are ſecur'd of the enjoyment of
our God:</p>
                  <p>Who by the ſole perfection of his own free
goodnes, * can never deny Himſelf to any that
love him:</p>
                  <p>Elſe would their very loving Him be the cauſe
of their miſery; ſince the miſery of a ſoul is the
want of what it loves.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Lord, whate're thy holy Books record
of Thee, in words comporting with our low ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitys:</p>
                  <p>Whate're they ſay of thy Reſtoring all things;
and Repairing again the ruines of mankind:</p>
                  <p>All is exactly verify'd by this one line, which
