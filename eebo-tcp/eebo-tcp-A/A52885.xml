            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Man, he had had two Sons, and two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

               <p>NOw <hi>Godliness</hi> had a few Servants of his own training up, well bred, fit to serve the best Noble-man in the Land; but he had not many to spare: He had tried to breed up more, but he could do no good on many of them, or they would not tarry with him. Such a one was <hi>Ignorance</hi>; but he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to be taught,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33957:18"/>
and he said he never came thither to be <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized. Errour</hi> would have dwelt with <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> too, as he said; but he must have the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Conscience, as he call'd it. <hi>Singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> made offer of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with him, to go hear when and where he pleased. <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> was more importunate than any one, to be his cheif Servant, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion too; and with his fair language, and <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-expressions,</hi> he had wrought himself for a while into a fair Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33957:18"/>
with <hi>Godliness:</hi> Oh he had such a tongue, that he was able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Man alive! and indeed he began so well, that had his deed been as good as his word, and had he held out as he began, he had been an extraordinary good servant: yea, <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie</hi> would fain have been exercising his gift; and said, he had spoken often in private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause; but he never ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for joyning in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with other; and they could never perceive that he used any private
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33957:19"/>
Prayer by himself; therefore his Master fell into Suspition of him; first for his much Talk, and his many Brags; and having set two of his old tried Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to observe him, <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Sincerity,</hi> they inform'd their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, they found him out to be a very Cheat, a notorious Lyar, and such a cunning Dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, that ye could not tell when to believe him: yea, they set him out to be such a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fellow, that he was enough to spoile the whole Family, at least
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33957:19"/>
to bring up an ill Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port against them all; therefore they desired their Master to rid the House speedily of him, or there was no staying for them. <hi>Godliness</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently calls for him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisheth him to mend his Manners; and in a great Passion (for it was said he was never so much moved with any one in all his life) he charged him to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently put out of doors, and never to come near his House, unless he brought <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> along to pass their word for him, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33957:20"/>
he was now another man; nay, <hi>Godliness</hi> was so passionate, that for his sake, he said he would never have any one of that name come into his Family again.</p>
               <p>And would you think it? <hi>Idleness</hi> had a mind to the service; but he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked great wages, and yet would do nothing; nor would he so much as promise to mend. But he had a few faithfull servants,<note place="margin">

               <p>I Could tell yon a long story of those two companions I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the last Chapter, <hi>viz. Stroyal</hi> and <hi>Lowal,</hi> if I thought it were not too far a digression from <hi>Godliness,</hi> whom we left all alone, driven both from <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Poverty</hi> too.</p>
               <p>I hope there are none but friends here; and if there be no <hi>Iesuites,</hi> we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33957:26"/>

The design of this short and <hi>innocent</hi> Paper, being only to relate the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tryals and Travels, and Discoveries and Experiments of <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> before he met with <hi>Content,</hi> whom he so much enquired for; and it would not willingly grieve any the least friend of <hi>Godliness</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were called <hi>Stroy-al</hi> and <hi>Low-al,</hi> I told you: But their right Names <hi>Stroyalla</hi> and <hi>Loyola</hi> (out-landish men by their names.) <hi>Stroyalla</hi> had by custom, and for brevity sake,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33957:27"/>
contracted his name in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Stroyal.</hi> And <hi>Loyola,</hi> because his grandfather <hi>Ignatius</hi> had made his name odious, would have his name contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted too into <hi>Loyal:</hi> which he was call'd by a while; but when he understood that name was grown into disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and it was not for his Interest to be known always by the same name; he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it once again, and would not be call'd <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ola</hi> nor <hi>Loyal,</hi> but <hi>Lowal:</hi> a true <hi>Catholick</hi> he was, a Man for all Interests and Opinions, indeed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33957:27"/>
none could tell what he was, he was so reserved, so mutable, and so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til: But for these two, I think they were two as unlucky Birds, as were ever hatch't. They were not so different in their Names, as agreeing in their Principles, Aims, and Dispositions; and <hi>Stroyal</hi> of the two was not half so mischievous to the <hi>State,</hi> as <hi>Lowal</hi> was pernicious to the <hi>Church.</hi> I hope I need not suspect, that any rational Man will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any reflection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended here, upon the honest and Religious

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33957:28"/>
had been circumcised. And as for <hi>Lowal,</hi> no body could tell what he was, and whither he would: he was, by the best intelligence I could get, by descent a <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gril-Moor,</hi> Born and Christened in <hi>Spain,</hi> confirmed at <hi>Rome</hi>; and for the pregnancy of his Parts commended to the <hi>Iesuits</hi> Colledge, hoping he might prove as useful an Instrument, as old <hi>Ignatius</hi> had been. Into their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he was admitted: there in a short time he had gone through the <hi>Arts,</hi> had gained divers

Languages, and could so perfectly conform to all Mens Tempers and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviours, as never a <hi>Father</hi> of them all was more versed in their greatest <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> than he was ready in the <hi>practice</hi> of their greatest art, <hi>Self-transformation.</hi> He could come familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into all the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies and private Meetings of Men, of whatever perswasion: and if he were a learner but a day or two, the third day he was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired Speaker, and would so deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,

                  <hi>GOdliness</hi> being thus unkindly dealt with, and driven out of Town (as you have heard) both by <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Poverty,</hi> was a while much perplexed whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he should remove to finde a resting place, and where to meet <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> his best Friend on Earth; which was his first design.

               <p>But <hi>Godliness</hi> replied he had been bred up in a plain and private way; he had not much means, nor many Friends, without which, what is to be expected

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33957:36"/>
                  <hi>Necessity</hi> puts them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Arms, and no longer.

               <p>Then he was by some perswaded to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into the World and <hi>Travel</hi>;<note place="margin">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33957:37"/>
was enough for him, and though he would judge no man, he had observed few returned better by Travels, as to their Religion: yea, he remembred of the <hi>Twelve</hi> chosen men of <hi>Israel,</hi> that were sent out to view other Countries, there were but two who returned the same Men they went out; the rest had cast off God, were corrupt in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and did much mischief to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>

               <p>He had at last, as to his setling in this world, a <hi>temptation</hi> (and he was seldome free from temptations in one kind or other) and that was to get him out of the World, and to sequester himself in some nook, in a solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner,<note place="margin">

open <hi>Prophaness</hi> (more grievous to a Godly minde than <hi>persecution</hi> it self) there might he enjoy God, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Conscience, and pour out his Soul in incessant Prayers; and enjoy communion with his <hi>Soul-beloved Saviour</hi>: This was mighty plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing But he remembred that Man was made for Society; and he had those <hi>Scriptures</hi> came to his mind: <hi>None of us live to our selves, We are members one of another; None of us are to seek our own things only, but every one the good of

               <p>
                  <hi>Labour</hi> had lived well before; but when <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> became his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, you would wonder how he came on and increased, as if <hi>Iacob</hi> had been come again into <hi>Labans</hi> Fields, or <hi>Ioseph</hi> into <hi>Potiphar's</hi> House, or the Ark into <hi>Obed-Edom.</hi> For, <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> taught him how to seek, and get a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing for him and his; brought him to pray in his Family, to instruct
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:33957:48"/>
his Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in Catechizing, to call upon God as duly as to rise out of their beds; and to flee lying, swearing, prophaness, and irreligiousness, as much as <hi>Idleness.</hi> And he told him withall, there was a friend of his was shortly to come that way (for he had a good promise for it) who would make them both happy: His name was <hi>Content.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I should have told you also, That though there was an Old Church hard by <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi>'s house, when <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:33957:48"/>
came thither, yet it was much gone to decay; and which was more trouble to <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> there was no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister: there had been one it seems some years before (a Godly anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent man, and very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:) <hi>Labour</hi> told him he Preached, Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and Expounded constantly; he did not think there was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in a good way, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordered: it would have done you good to see how people loved the Church, kept the Sabbath, and what love was among Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33957:49"/>
But that good old Man was dead, and now No-body cared whether they had a Minister or no: They thought Any-body that could speak, might Preach; and as for Prayer, and reading the Scripture, singing of Psalms, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he saw there were few did regard them now adayes; and if the Church should fall down to the Ground, he knew none would take care to repair it. There were many suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Men in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, he said; but they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33957:49"/>
loved their Money too well: and there was one above all the rest, call'd <hi>Riches,</hi> worth Thousands; but he was neither Friend to the Poor, nor the Church; but would rather spend an hundred Pounds on his <hi>Pride, Luxury,</hi> and <hi>Ryot,</hi> than allow forty Shillings towards the maintenance of a good Minister. But as for me, said <hi>Labour,</hi> as poor a Man as I am, if my Neighbours would be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by me, we would not for shame let the Church fall, and live like Heathens, without
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33957:50"/>
one to guide us: whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will be at the cost, I would bestow my pains; and it should go heard; but I would find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for such a good work. Gods blessing on thy heart, said <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; I shall love thee the better for it while I know thee: we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, see to get the Church fitted, and then look out for a Minister; and if thou wilt be at the pains; I'le bear all the charges whatsoever it cost, though I leave the less to my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>My Ancestors have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33957:50"/>
always been great friends to the Church and a godly Ministry; They have at their own charge, built many Churches from the ground, and richly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed them for the comfortable maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Minister, when they had done. One of my Progenitors, call'd <hi>Obadiah,</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone provided for an hundred Prophets in a time of Famine, fed them with bread and water by fisty in a cave; which was as good fare as he had himself; and he believed none of his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:33957:51"/>
Friends were ever the poorer for such good Works; but still God had blessed them the more abundantly. He for his part, were not worthy to be called by the Name of <hi>Godliness,</hi> if he should be backward in such a Business: And his Wife <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> he was sure, would put to her helping Hand; for she was own Sister to <hi>Dorcas,</hi> that was so full of good Works and Alms-deeds, which she did; and was so much lamented when she was dead and gone. To be short, They conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33957:51"/>
between them to fall upon the work; and the Church was but newly repaired in a plain and decent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and a good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster settled in the place, when <hi>Content</hi> came.</p>
