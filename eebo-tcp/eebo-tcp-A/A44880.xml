            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N obedience to Your Commands (for such to me are your requests) and that I might give a publike testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my gratitude for all your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and bounty towards me, I have Pressed the ensuing Sermon for Your Service, &amp; prefixt Your Name, as having the greatest right thereto.</p>
            <p>Tis the first Sermon, of this kind, that ever I made, and I hope 'twill be the last on so sad an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. I acknowledge that not long before, at the intreaty and tears of two poor Orphans, and the importunity of their Friends, I (having, God is my witness, no other end then charity, to save the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed Orphans charges, and Bury their dead Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decently) Preached at his Funeral, a Sermon made long before upon another occasion. This inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent act, some have endeavoured to asperse, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending (as you have heard) that some Men of
<pb facs="tcp:65595:3"/>
worth and note, have highly censured me for it. Which I cannot believe; 'tis below their worth to wrong open innocence. Indeed we read of a man of a great Name (<hi>Alexander</hi>) that wronged <hi>St Paul;</hi> but of no worth, he was a Copper-smith. I cannot think men of worth, let their names be never so great, will take up here the Tinkers office, 'tis too smutty for them.</p>
            <p>Sir, the Coare lies here; Your pitching upon so worthlesse and inconsiderable a person as my self, for such honourable imployment as this, has begot a heart-burning in some narrow breasted persons, which breakes out into such kind of groundless aspersions: as if I affected popularity, and Pharisee like desired to be seen and heard in publick: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as (the Lord knowes) I no more delight in it, then the deformed Cripple, to be seen on a Theatre. Had I sought this honour, so much grudg'd me, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge I had justly deserv'd the censure of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrogant: had I deny'd you, who, that knowes my obligations, could accuse me of lesse then high ingratitude? I am confident, persons of farre higher worth were invited first to this noble task, and tis our unhappyness we injoy'd them not; their high parts would farre better have become this Scene: but, but let me say, none could have more patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally performed the part of a mourner then my self. Many might have done it with greater skill and parts, but none with stronger affection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65595:3"/>Sir what I here have brought, is so mean, that with greif and blushing I present it. I know your goodness will bate it something, upon the score of grief, that stupefyes, and at that time I was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with. You must expect nothing that's flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid either in Sermon or ensuing Speech.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Non est conveniens luctibus ille color.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I presume you'l find truth plain and pertinent in them both. The last is justly culpable, non in regard of what is, but what is not (that ought to be) said: All there is generally known to be truth; but that All, amounts not to Half of whats due to Her you justly loved so dearly. However, knowing that your modesty had rather I erred on this, then the other extreme; and presuming your generosity will cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously accept of weak things well meant; I humbly put my self at your feet, and this poore thing into your hand, and begge nothing but your pardon for it: Doe Your Self, and it that right, in reading it as to <hi>agnoscere quod Dei est,</hi> and vouchsafe the Authour the favour as to <hi>ignoscere quod homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis est,</hi> so will you eternally oblige</p>

               <bibl>
                  <hi>Ezekiel 24.</hi> v. <hi>16.</hi>
               </bibl>
               <q>Son of man, behold, I take away the desire of thine eyes with a stroak.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THis Sable Sceane bespeakes our sorrow and has drawn us hither, as you see, to tread the mournfull stage this day in a drooping stateliness, whether we are come to pay the last kisses of an honourable farewell, in a tribute of tears, justly due to the Herse of the Lady <hi>ANN HARCOVRT.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this end, I have chosen this apposite Text, which when I have repeated, I may close my book, sit down in sorrow, and in tears take up our Saviours words and say, this day is <hi>this Scripture fullfilled in your eies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It sounds like thunder in all our eares, and like a thunder bolt thrown from the hand of the Almighty, seemes to shiver that soul of her nearest relation, who erst while was giving it up to her, that She might live.</p>
            <p>But that must not be, Heaven's decree must be as well obey'd as fear'd, which speaks this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65595:5"/>
day, as it did to this holy man of God here in my text; <hi>Son of man behold I take away the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of thine eyes with a stroak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Text is a sorrowfull and unexpected, but peremptory message from God to the Prophet.</p>
            <p>In it we may observe, the <hi>Agent,</hi> and the <hi>Patients.</hi> The <hi>Agent, God.</hi> The <hi>Patients</hi> are, 1 the <hi>Prophet</hi> the looser, and the Person lost his <hi>Wife.</hi> But we shall take the words as they fall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are these Five things observable. 1. The Title given to the Prophet <hi>Son of man.</hi> 2. His duty injoyned him, imply'd in the word <hi>behold.</hi> 3. The Authour of this, <hi>l.</hi> 4. The sad message exprest <hi>take away the desire of thine eyes.</hi> 5. The manner how, <hi>with a stroak.</hi> Of these I shall breifly touch in their order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the Title given to this eminent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, <hi>Son of man,</hi> in the Hebrew tis <hi>ben Adam. Adam,</hi> was the name of the first man, the father of mankind, and he had his name from <hi>red earth,</hi> out of which he was formed. This Name, though it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to his posterity, yet since the fall, the Scripture useth thereby to denote the weakness or the wickedness of man, as <hi>Iob</hi> 25.6. <hi>Bildad</hi> styles <hi>ben Adam, a worme, i. e.</hi> a weak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable creature, <hi>non solum quia sicut vermis ex corruptione nascitur; sed quia abibit tandem in vermes. Pineda ex Philip.</hi> A creature of no
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65595:5"/>
continuance, or stability, wormes meate. In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.19. there, <hi>ben Adam,</hi> signifies a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man: <hi>If they be Children of men that have stir'd thee up against me, Cursed be they</hi>: there <hi>bene Adam</hi> signifies wicked men, the incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of a King against his loyal subjects are wicked men, and deserve to be accursed. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in <hi>Ps.</hi> 57.4. <hi>my soul is amongst Lyons, even the sons of men, i. e.</hi> wicked men.</p>
            <p>The Hebrew language wants not words to set forth a man of worth; they style him <hi>ish,</hi> from <hi>esh,</hi> Fyre, importing Life, Spirit, and Vigor inhi <hi>Ps.</hi> 49.2. We find both here mean men, and men of worth set down under a various expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: <hi>gam bene Adam gam bene ish</hi>; which our English for want of fit words have in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage rendred <hi>both high and low,</hi> but learned <hi>Tremelius</hi> more aptly in the Latine, <hi>tum nati plebeo homine, tum nati praestanti viro.</hi> After the same manner the Grecians distinguish of men; they call the vulgar men by the name <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which comes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>a suspiciendo sursum. i. e.</hi> he looks upward for help, being helplesse in himself, but men of worth and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, they called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> because <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. We find both these in <hi>Herodotus</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. There are (saith he) many men, but few virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous magnanimous men in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65595:6"/>But can there no better title be found for <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> then <hi>ben Adam,</hi> which is a diminitive title at the best? His Name, Birth, worth, and Parts be speak him great; his Name, saies <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Hierom,</hi> signifies <hi>Dei imperium, seu fortitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Dei,</hi> and such as his name was, such was he, strengthned by God, and mighty with him; his Birth was Honourable, and his Parts, and Piety answerable to his birth; St. <hi>Hierom</hi> on <hi>Ezek.</hi> c. 47. calls him for his profound parts, <hi>Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum Oceanum &amp; mysteriorum Labyrinthum,</hi> &amp; in another place, <hi>sui seculi portentum. Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Adricomius</hi> say he was an eminent Martyr: Certainly with men, he was great; but now God comes to speak to him, he'l make him know that he is but <hi>ben Adam,</hi> a poor, weak, helpless, inconsiderable creature, full of sin, and imperfection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obs.</hi> 1. When God comes to deal with men of high degree, and eminent parts, He'l make them know they are but low, worthless, meane and helpless creatures.</p>
            <p>Great men in Learning, are apt to idolize their guifts and indowments; they, for the most part, sit without the gunshot of controll; few dare say to them, what dost thou? they have more flatterers then friends, who, as sutors for their favour, by their flattering applauses, stand like magnifying glasses before them, and make
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65595:6"/>
them seem bigger then they are. Thus <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi> eloquence must be extold to the skies, and he deified. A Scholer that by his parts has got the popular applause, how strangely, oft times, may we observe him to be puffed up, how he states it, and struts it in his fancy, thinking the heads of his betters, scarce ground good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him to put the sole of his foot upon. Tis not only so, with men of great guifts, but graces also; which made our learned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>Fox</hi> say, he got hurt by his graces, and good by his sins, His graces puffed him up.</p>
            <p>Thus also tis with men of great Wealth, as <hi>Solomon</hi> observes, the rich mans wealth is his strong city, which he opposeth to any right or reason; it exalts them in their thoughts and words; might, and power, and honour, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, is the common dialect they discourse in. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Is not this great Babylon that I have built by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty.</hi> Hence it comes to pass, that they quite forget themselves; and now God comes as their remembrancer.</p>

gathered by the Passenger. If it outstand these, ere long it blossoms, withers, and dyes; such is our life, in our best estate we are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanity, because uncertain and mutable, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.5: therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.8. calls the Sons of men, <hi>bene haloph</hi> children of chang.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iob</hi> compares our life to a <hi>Post,</hi> a <hi>Ship,</hi> and an <hi>Eagle hasting to her prey.</hi> Observe the climax: a Post makes hast, stays not, rides night and day; but he will at last tyre, and then he must ly down: therefore he takes up a stronger comparison, and compares our life to a Ship sayling, that tyres not: but wind and tyde may faile and then she stands still; therefore he compares our life to an Eagle, sharp set in pursuing her prey. An Eagle is the swiftest and strongest of long wing'd Hawkes, what flyes stronger and swifter than she? Such is our time here, it flyes away upon a swift wing, and death when it makes a stoop at us maks no canceleire.</p>
            <p>Well then, since all our earthly injoyments are of no certain continuance, lets learn hence these three lessons.</p>
            <p>Be not vainly confident in the possessing of them; 'tis a vanity in a great Person to build strong presumptions upon worldly props that are tottering and weak; the Psalmist excellently turnes their hearts outward, <hi>Ps.</hi> 49.11 that the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65595:12"/>
posterities to come may decline that vanity; he speaks of worldly rich men, and tels you their purposes, thoughts and designes; God has blest them with estates and prosperity; and now <hi>their inward thought is that their houses shall continue for ever</hi>; doe they think to live for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? no, but they intend their posterity shall live for ever, and keep up the state and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of the family, therefore they <hi>call their houses after their name,</hi> says he; they think, now God has blest them with a numerous off-spring, that <hi>nodosa quadam aeternitate,</hi> their name shall be kept up for ever: but what says the <hi>Psalmist, this their way</hi> i. e. their contrivance, <hi>is their folly,</hi> vers. 13: to build such high presumptions on such rotten props is their folly: and they find it so, for in the next words, says he, <hi>they goe down to hell like sheep, and death feeds on them</hi>: How like sheep? why, like as silly sheep in a fat pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, feed and play, and fear nothing, though the Butcher come and fetch away, now one, then an other; which startles them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but that being over, they fall to feed and play again, until the Butcher by little and little fetch them all away at last. So doe these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Confident men, who are fed to the full, and have enough to keep up greatness to posterity, who securely, wantonly and haughtily, vant it in their thoughts that they shall continue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; find death like a Slaughterman ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anon

come amongst them, now taking a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then a son, anon a wife, 'till at last all the props they trusted in be taken quite away. How oft doe we see it come thus to pass, that many great families are quite taken away from their great estates (like sheep out of a fat pasture) and the estate passes into an other name and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. I will conclude this with that wise King's counsel, <hi>Pr.</hi> 27.1. <hi>Boast not thy selfe of to morrow, for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</hi> The word <hi>halal</hi> signifying to boast, signifies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to be madd. <hi>q. d.</hi> 'tis madness and folly in men of wealth and greatness, to think to build their nests among the Stars, when they are not sure of injoying any thing they have a whole day. The family of <hi>Eli,</hi> which was the greatest in Israel in the morning, its props were cut down ere night, and the rest destin'd to perpetual beggery; And <hi>Iob</hi> liv'd to see himselfe in one day stript of all that he could call good in this world. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reads the text thus, <hi>for thou knowest not what this day may bring forth.</hi> That day that <hi>Belshazar</hi> was priding himselfe in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he fell. Let me speak then to you rich and great men in the Apostles word, Charge the rich in this world that they be not high mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor trust in uncertain riches. The more confident you are, the less secure, especially if you belong to God, <hi>qualibet elatio tanto citius

Since the choisest of our earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are perishing, mutable and uncertain: Let this teach us to put a true estimate on those things that are eternal, that are perminent.

Twas Treasure in Heaven was promised him. The least treasure of heaven is worth all the worlds possession, because eternall: had the young man put eternal into the Scale with his great possessions, they would have seemed no more great in his eye; But this curse of the young mans, is that which falls upon us; men are like bruit beasts, wholely taken up with sensuality, and devoted to temporall things; but the things which are not seen, which are eternall, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65595:15"/>
and slighted and laught at; their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall minds are enimies to such things, they are foolishness to them: the reason is, because they see no farther then what they sensually apprehend, they cannot see (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> says) a farre off; and therefore men affect, what they sensually apprehend, which can goe no higher then sensuall things, things which are seen, which are temporall.</p>
            <p>Pray therefore, again and again, that God would inlighten your minds, by Faith, to see the excellency of things that are eternall; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this, will lessen the world to you; what are great possessions, honours, crowns, to eternity? to be made a King for a day, and ever after a begger; what comfort can this be? but he that hath an interest in Christ, is made a King for ever; what is it to have an hour, or two's pleasure, and ever after live in a dungeon? these profits, pleasures, honours, riches, are but for a moment, and leave a sting behind them, but the pleasures, profits, honours, of heaven are eternall; <hi>life eternall, Ioyes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures at his righ hand for ever more, Crowns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible,</hi> and many such Scripturall expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

            <p n="1">1. That it is so, Scripture examples prove it. Examples of this, are as old as the world. So soon as God set up a School, a Church, in the world, we find a severe rod in it; 'twas signed with the Crosse in its infancy. We may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> (the true servants of God we beleive:) When God had blest them with an off-spring, the greatest of temporall blessings, therein sweetning their sorrows with the pleasure of society; no sooner are the two Sons (the Crown of their Parents glory, and the ground of their future hope) grown to be usefull to their Parents, but they are both in a moment taken from them; the one by murder, the other, by banishment: Thus their Sun sets at noone: <hi>Abel</hi> the delight of their eyes, is become the mornfull object of their tears; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably this their dear son, was one of the first gastly sights of death that they had seen, which must needs be irksome: the Son of their joy, is become the subject of their sorrow, their Cro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Who in his condition would have dreamed of crosses? But alas! his rise is intended for his ruine. <hi>Saul</hi> intended to make a halter of his garland; the Court had like to have been <hi>Davids</hi> charnall house; <hi>Davids</hi> fingers did not play there so quick upon his Harp-strings, as <hi>Sauls</hi> envy plaid upon <hi>Davids</hi> Heart-strings.

               <hi>Reas.</hi> The second thing to be inquired into, is, Why God thus exerciseth them?</p>
            <p>To give a reason of the various dispensations of his providences to men here below, is so grand a mystery that reason cannot find it out. This <hi>Iob</hi> excellently cleares. <hi>C.</hi> 28. <hi>v.</hi> 12. he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the question, and in the following <hi>verses</hi> answers it, that tis not by humane invention to be found out, the <hi>depth saith tis not in me, and the sea saith tis not in me,</hi> neither can gold or precious stones purchase this knowledge. That it should goe well with the wicked, and ill with the Godly, hath not only stagger'd the Heathens, but hath made sometimes the Saints in a pett to quarrell at it. <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. <hi>v.</hi> 2. to 13. it made <hi>David</hi> repiningly say, I have cleansed my heart in vain, for all the day long have I been plagued; and when he seeks to know the reason of this, <hi>v.</hi> 16. he confesseth 'twas to hard for him. What does he doe in this case? <hi>v.</hi> 17. he went into the sanctuary of God. So let us, to find a reason of these things, and there we shall find that the alwise and gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sees affliction necessary for his choisest servants, in order to their good. <hi>Nulla causa</hi> (saith <hi>August.) probabiliter occurrit, cur justi homines in hac vita laborant, nisi quia hoc iis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedit.</hi> Tis needfull for them to be afflicted.</p>
            <p>Ther's a twofold good, Privative, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65595:18"/>
that God aimes at in afflicting his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In order to their privative good, a necessity of afflicting them ariseth from two evils that the best of Saints are infested with in this life: Sin within, and Temptations without.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sin with in them: Originall sin is still an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in the regenerate; though it be pardoned &amp; mortified that it shall not reign in them.

               </gap>n: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the old man still remaine in us, it came with us from the womb, and 'twill bear us company to the grave, till death part us. Though the tree be cut down, the root remains, and will without diligent watching sprout, and bring forth bitter fruit to our sorrow: as it did in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er,</hi> and other Saints.</p>
            <p>God whose spirituall eye lookes through and through us, sees in the best of us many secret enormous lusts, as pride, covetousnesse, luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, spirituall sloth, hypocricy, security and the like, which we in our prosperity discerne not; that lye in our breasts secretly and hidden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, like Toads and noisom vermin in dark sinks and sells, which we walk over unconcerned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we see them not. Now God calls to Saints in their prosperity by his providences, (for they have a voice) and by the ministry, to clense
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65595:19"/>
these hearts and cast out these vermin, that are a provocation to the pure eyes of his holynesse. How oft has God by his word called to us, Love not the world, nor the things of the world; Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouthes, No vnclean person shall enter into the kingdome of heaven, Remember thou &amp; all thy family to keep holy the Sabbath, Pray more constantly, Be more fervent in prayer: God calls but we turn the deaf ear, and slight these calls of God, and God observes it. <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.21. <hi>I spake to thee in thy prosperity, and thou saidest, I will not hear</hi>: Now God in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for prevention is inforced to take his rod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God is necessitated to afflict his people for the prevention of evil that would arise from temptations without us; for Saints are not free from temptation <hi>neminem prorsus Dei gratia fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit intentabilem,</hi> saith <hi>Gratian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two Tempters, the Divil and the World, without us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Devil, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>He goes about like a roaring Lyon seeking whom he may devour,</hi> like a Lyon he's greedy, subtill, active, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, he lies alwaies at the catch for us; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he has not immediate power over us, he useth, as his bait,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The World, the other temptation, which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65595:19"/>
holds out, as a rich Marchant its guilded ware, the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life; this holds out the baite, that layes the snare: the Divel baites his hook with that he thinks our constitutions will soonest bite at, and so catches us: So he caught <hi>David</hi> with the lust of the eye, so he caught <hi>Solomon</hi> with the pride of life, and lust of the flesh.</p>
            <p>These pleasures, and profits, and honours of the world, are usually the Saints greatest temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for the concomitants of ease and plenty, are luxury, carnall confidence, security, which draw off the heart from God, dull their appetite to spirituall things, take off their hunger after a Sacrament, and make them neglect coming to it, coole their affections, and allay that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency which should be in prayer. As the best ground brings forth the rankest weeds in the heat of sommer, when the Plow is still &amp; comes not over it; so many times, doth the warmth of prosperity, cause many lusts to break forth in the lives of the Saints. Raw fruit breeds worms in healthy persons: so doe worldly pleasures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite lusts in the best Saints many times, as loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wantonnesse, and pride; let <hi>David</hi> have but a little ease, and his mole-hill presently growes, in his proud fancy, to be a mountaine. <hi>I said in my prosperity I shall never be moved</hi>; what ranck blood, did a little prosperity breed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65595:20"/>
in this holy man? his successe in warre, and strength of allyes raised in him presumption, that nourish'd lust, lust stole his ardency of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from God, and that intercepted his confidence; and now his mountaine has stole his heart from God, was it not time for God to set his mountaine on fire about his eares, in raising <hi>Absolom</hi> against him, that he might fly back to the rock of his salvation. You see God is necessitated f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om the evils that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Saints, and from the tempters without them, to afflict them for their good privatively.</p>
            <p>Now from Gods afflicting the Saints, there ariseth a threefold privative good.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God by afflicting them, redresses sin in them, it makes them feel what an evil and a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing it is to sin against the Lord, it makes the Saint to search his waies and turn unto the Lord; so it wrought upon <hi>David, before I was afflicted I went a stray, but now I have learned thy word</hi>; afflictions like hard weather kill those sinnes, that the warmth of prosperity nourish'd.</p>
            <p>The Devill by pleasures and profits invites us, as <hi>Absolom</hi> did the Kings sonnes to his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, purposely to murder <hi>Ammon</hi>: So he invites us to our ruine in the gluttonns language, <hi>eat, drink, and be merry,</hi> thou hast enough, wealth enough, time enough, opportunity enough, <hi>rejoyce o young man and let thy heart cheare thee</hi>: Now God in mercy to us, when he finds we are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65595:20"/>
sate down to banquet, riot, and frolick it in the world, he by a rousing affliction unexpectedly comes amongst us, as <hi>Absoloms</hi> murderers came in, when their hearts were merry, and made all the Kings sons fly to the King their Father to Jerusalem; so God sends afflictions to drive us from our Lusts and deceitfull pleasures, unto him, <hi>oculos quos peccatum claudit, poena aperit,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Another privative good that comes by Gods afflicting of the Saints, is, hereby sin is prevented, he like a mercyfull Father and most wise Physitian knowes our tempers, and what our spirituall diseases are, better then our selves, and therefore to prevent them he bloods them in the right vein; when a Saint immoderately loves any earthly injoyment, so that God seeth it drawes his affections from heaven and glory; and from himself (which he takes grievously) then God in wisdome and mercy takes away that earthly comfort that his affections may turn into the right channell again; hereby God shewes us the mutability, inconstancy &amp; vanity of these things, and that there is no safe footing for our affections upon them. God many times dashes our designs all in peices, to prevent that security and carnall confidence, which he wisely foresees would follow, if they should take. God in mercy provides a thorne for <hi>Paul</hi> to prick the tympany of Pride, if it should rise in him. 'Twas an excellent pious speech of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65595:21"/>
our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, <hi>I thank God,</hi> saith he, <hi>that hath given me a weake, and infirme body, that it might not be a lustfull body.</hi> A Saint has as much cause to blesse God for his afflictions, as for his ordinances, we shall never be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the one half of our privative mercyes which afflictions have been the cause of, till we come to heaven to account them there, to the praise of his grace and wisdome that mercifully did inflict them: Lord whether would our lusts haue carried us, hadst not thou by thy correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons called us back.</p>
            <p n="3">3 By afflictions God prevents our damnation 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 11 32 We are chastned of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world: God hates the men of the world, and therefore chastens them not here so often as his children; he throwes the reignes in their necks, and bids them fil up the measure of their iniquity: which is the greatest curse that can befall them; in this sense that saying is true, <hi>tum Deus irascitur cum non irascitur.</hi> The Heathen could say, nothing is more unhappy to a man, then to be free from affliction, <hi>nihil mihi videtur infoelicius eo, cui ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil unquam evenit adversi,</hi> Senec. <hi>de Provid.</hi> Here it is true, there can no greater evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall a man, then to have his heaven here. <hi>Son remember that thou receivedst thy good things in this life</hi> (saith Abraham to Dives in hell) <hi>and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65595:21"/>
Laza<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rus evill: now thou art tormented and he is comforted.</hi> God gives his Saints their hell here, but their heaven hereafter; purposely casts them into the furnace of affliction here, that he may keep them out of the firy furnace of hell hereafter. A Saint may take this for his Motto, <hi>Periissem nisi Periissem,</hi> had I not been undone in this world, I had been undone to eternity: The Prodigals poverty brought him back to his Fathers family.</p>
            <p>Thus you see a necessity for the best Saints afflictions in order to their good priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God exerciseth his Saints with smart af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, in order to their Positive good, and that, these three waies.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As they are instrumentall to the turning them to God. 2. As they are exercises of their graces. 3. As they are the meanes of increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God useth them as a meanes to call home and convert the Elect to him. I doe not say they Physically operate, for many men are the worse for affliction: but they by the gacious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of a divine hand, have a morrall influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon men to their conversion. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.26, 27, 30. by an earthquake on a sudden that shooke the foundations of the prison, and threw open the prison doores, and knockt off all the

prisoners fetters; the keeper at first apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this astonishing providence would have killed himself, his conscience was so overborn with fear, but when his Judgement had got the throne, he considers this could be no other but the mighty hand of God, and in the full convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this his will is resolved to fall down to the command of God, &amp; now with trembling he askes <hi>what he shall he doe to be saved.</hi> Oh blessed earthquake, might the goaler say, that wrought such a heart-quake in him as to make him turn to God.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Saul Acts</hi> 9.3, 4. by a sudden stroak from heaven, which struck him to the ground, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and filled him full of trembling &amp; astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was the instrument of his conviction: hereby conscience being fill'd with fear, made the mind serious, and being under full convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it in an instant raised his will to a resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that resolved, now commands all the affections to attend its motion, &amp; now he cryes <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to doe</hi>? Thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, they are like a gun discharged amongst wild fowles, it startles all but it makes some fall into the fowlers hands, into Christs, that by these afflictions brings them to his hand. God by sudden and unexpected afflictions comes upon a soul, as <hi>Samuel</hi> came upon the <hi>Bethlehemites,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.4. he makes them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65595:22"/>
tremble at his comming, but he makes a King in the family ere he depart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God hereby tryes and exercises his Saints graces. Although God doth never afflict any, but where sin is, yet he hath other ends besides afflicting them for sin; therefore <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.1. God tempted or tryed <hi>Abraham,</hi> tis not said he corrected <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he said <hi>offer up thy Son Isaac.</hi> So God permitted all those afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to come upon <hi>Iob,</hi> for the tryall of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and the exercise of them: you have heard of the patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> saith the Apostle, had not God exercised him with such great afflictions, we had never heard of such an eminent Saint, he would have stole to his grave without being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of. Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> saith (1 <hi>Ep. c.</hi> 1.7.) to the afflicted Saints, <hi>ye are now in heaviness for a time throw manyfold temptations,</hi> for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose? <hi>that the tryall of your faith might be found to praise, and honour, and glory</hi>; the Saints that shall hear and see your heavenly, meek, self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying frame of heart under all your afflictions shall praise you, &amp; praise God for you, you shall honour the gospell, the cause you suffer for, and God shall be glorified by you, and in you. As <hi>Mutius Scaevola</hi> got more renown &amp; glory to the Romans by his Sufferings then by his Actions. So doth a Saint to the cause of the gospell. A Saint by sufferings seemes to say to all the world, as he, <hi>tam vile est corpus gloriam spectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus.</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:65595:23"/>
So contemptible are all those terrene things to us, who seek after eternal glory. If God should not thus try a Christians graces, we should never come to know half their worth, nor they their own. <hi>Senecae</hi> counts him an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy man that never was in affliction; because neither he nor any other could know his worth. <hi>Miserum te judico quod nunqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fuisti miser, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siisti sine adversario vitam; nemo scit quid potue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, ne tu quidem ipse.</hi> As sharp incounters prove who are valiant, who cowards; so do afflictions, who are sound, who rotten, who are built upon the sands, who on the rock. A Saint has cause, as to praise God for bestowing grace, so for sending him afflictions to try the truth of his grace, for this brings him in unspeakable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that he is sincere. If the heathen could say, <hi>egi gratias fortunae quod experiri voluisset quanti aestimarem fidem,</hi> I thank fortune that she would try me, how much I esteemed honesty; this I ought (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) to prize at a high rate, <hi>non debet mihi parvo res tanta constare</hi>; if he a heathen could say thus, how much more ought we to praise God, that hath been pleased by his tryals of us to manifest to our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences and the world, that our faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and selfe denyal is sincere; a tryed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is a happy Christian, and God by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions tryes them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:65595:23"/>3. God exerciseth his choice Servants with great afflictions for the increase of their graces. As strong and great winds and stormes make trees fruitfull, so doe sharp afflictions make Christians. Every branch in Christ must bring forth fruit, and God by afflictions will prune them that they may bring forth more fruit.</p>
            <p>Christians that have grace in the habit, St. <hi>Bazil</hi> compares to the earth, which though in its nature it be fruitful, yet unlesse the Plow and harrow break and teare it, it will not only not be fruitful, but it will bring forth bryers and thorns: so will Christians, unlesse God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise them with afflictions grow secure, lazie and sensual. This made <hi>Chrysostome</hi> say, that affliction is the mother of Christian virtues, because it exerts the habit into act.</p>
            <p>Christians that have grace in the habit, are like an Organ that is well in tune; but for want of bellows to blow, and an hand to play, they make no musick. Therefore God raiseth his east wind of affliction to blow, and layes his hand upon them, and then they are melodious. As Birds sing sweetest in wet weather, so doe the Saints sing most melodiously amidst the storms and showres of afflictions.</p>
            <p>Sharp sauces doe best quicken the appetite, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11: noe chastisements seem for the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65595:24"/>
present to be joyous, but grievous, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less afterwards it yeildeth the peaceable fruits of righteousnesse unto them that are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therewith; like soile thats unpleasant in the carrying forth, yet returnes a fruitful crop.</p>
            <p>By affliction a Saint gets this farther advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of increase, that not only the habit of grace is excited into act; but by those frequent acts the habit also is inlarged. What St. <hi>Hierom</hi> sayes of the Cedar (may be said of the Saint) that for every branch it sutes out above, it sends forth a root beneath, and this advantage it hath from the strong winds which by sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the body, loosens the earth and makes way for the root to spread.</p>
            <p>So that by one storme it gathers strength to stand against the next. Thus tis with the Saint in the valley of <hi>Bacor,</hi> he grows from strength to strength; afflictions make him increase both in the habit and acts of grace; he grows down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the habit as well as upward in the acts of grace by affliction.</p>
            <p>Thus God sees afflictions good for his Saints both privatively and possitively; give me leave briefly to add this one more.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God sees afflictions necessary for his Saints in order to their eternal good, and that upon a twofold account.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By afflictions he fits and prepares them
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65595:24"/>
for glory, and that by drawing up their hearts and affections where their treasure is; should not God imbitter Egypt to us by heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, we should never long for, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to goe into the promis'd land, God makes our good things here mutable and fading, that we may set our affections on things above, which are permanent and unchangable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Afflictions sweeten and the more indear glory to come: the sharper our sorrows here, the sweeter our glory hereafter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. Our light afflictions work for us a farr more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and eternal weight of glory.</p>
            <p>Since we find this doctrine to be an evident truth, and this vast congregation are sealing it with their teares; God hath taken away an eminent Servant of his <hi>by a stroak,</hi> a stroak to the rich, and a stroak to the poore, a stroak and a heavy one to <hi>Stanton Harcourt</hi>; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the family of the <hi>Harcourts,</hi> what should this teach us? let not me, but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles exhort you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5; <hi>My Son despise not thou the chastning of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.</hi> This exhortation bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che it selfe into two heads. 1: despise not, 2: faint not: the first you may think needlesse, and at this time I may think so to; but such is the deceitfulnesse of our hearts, and the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of them, that though they now drop tears
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65595:25"/>
like rocks in a sudden storm, yet when the storm is over, they are soon dry again, and as hard as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; therefore the first branch is not unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: despise not, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>parvam curam habere,</hi> to slight and never mind a thing, to make light of it, as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants doe of their Masters chiding: they stand demurely and look sadly for the present; but when the Masters back is turn'd, they laugh and make light of it. Of all things beware of this; God hath a farther end in such dreadful stroakes as these, than to make us hang down our heads for a week or two, and then forget all; this is indeed to make light of God's cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting hand upon us. There are a sort of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picureans in this age, that professedly against all sense and reason, indeavour to deface what of man they have in them, natural affection; like the brutish Stoick that made no more of the death of his Son, than of the breaking of a Jugg; <hi>heri vidi fragilem frangi, hodie vidi mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talem mori</hi>; they contemne God and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, they say all things come alike to all, and sooner or later we must all dye, and what should we sorrow for that we cannot remedy. Upon such mens foreheads you may write fool (if the rule hold true) without injuring them; for consideration, and fooles are alwaies contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65595:25"/>
Well let us in the fear of God learne this wisdome, not to despise or disregard God's judgements and chastisements upon us.</p>
            <p>Then a Christian may be said not to despise God's Corrections, when he learnes those les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons God points him to by the chastisement; as 1: seriously to search after the cause why God afflicts us, 3 <hi>Lam.</hi> 39.40: this the Holy Ghost points us to, <hi>why doth living man complain,</hi> i. e. repiningly, <hi>man for the punishment of his sinne?</hi> while 'tis for his sinne that he is punish'd; 'tis but just that he should be punished: lets there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore search our ways and turne unto the Lord our God; thats the lesson punishment should teach us: so in the 7th <hi>Iosh.</hi> 6. Up says God to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> search for the sinne that hath caused me to smite you; thus a Christian should search when God's hand is on him; what personal sins, what relation, what family sins, as a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, master or father he is guilty of, and stone those <hi>Achans,</hi> that so God may gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return in his favours again to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In a humble submission to vindicate God's justice in all that befals us, and with the Church to say, thou hast smitten us lesse than our deservings, and o Lord thou art righteous in all that is come upon us, <hi>Isay</hi> 9.13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Patiently to submit to the hand of God upon us. I was dumbe (says <hi>David</hi>) and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65595:26"/>
not my mouth, because it was thy doing, 10 <hi>Levit.</hi> 3. When God took away two of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's</hi> near relations, his Sons, with a dreadful stroak the text saith, <hi>Aron held his peace</hi>; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably <hi>Aron</hi> was faulty in not restraining his Sons presumption, and therefore think it but meet &amp; just, that he that had been sinfully si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent under Gods dishonour, should now be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively silent under his displeasure.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To buckle on our Armour, and to stand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prepared to incounter afflictions; <hi>Through many tribulations we must enter into the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> not through two or three but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, God knows what our next tryal will be; lets therefore by this affliction, be so Armed with faith and love, and patience, and selfe-denyal, that we may be able with more facility to stand against the next: <hi>Iob</hi> now finding the world to ring none but changes, and sad ones too, in his eares, hath learned to wait all the days of his appointed time, 'til his chang come.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Often and seriously to reflect upon our soules, what privative or positive good they have got by afflictions; for they make us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or leave us worse.</p>
            <p>These are some of the lessons God sets us to learne by our afflictions; which who so learns may truly be said, not to despise the chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The last clause of the exhortation speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65595:26"/>
to us thus [<hi>nor faint when thou art corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of him</hi>] this is the other extreame we must avoid. Extreams are dangerous, fly not one so as to fall into the other, this nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns as folly, <hi>Stulti dum vitant vitia in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traria currunt,</hi> saith <hi>Horace.

            <p>ANd is this Scripture fulfilled this day in our eys? is the Crown of our glory, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Anne Harcourt,</hi> that curious piece of grace and nature taken from us <hi>by a stroak?</hi> And must her virtues be closed up with her eyes? must they be coffin'd up with her corps in the silent grave?

'Tis pitty we have not here an Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Ambrose</hi> to performe so lofty an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.

I must acknowledge with the Comedian, <hi>de illâ non possum ita magnificè loqui, id virtus quin superat sua,</hi> so that you that knew her, will have just cause to say, much like that of the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> concerning <hi>Solomon,</hi> the one halfe hath not been told us of what we know; to which I can only thus reply in the Poets words;

In order to what I have to say, I must goe one step retrograde; For when I consider what two glorious luminaries have successively rose in this noble &amp; ancient Family of the <hi>Harcourts,</hi> &amp; how suddenly, &amp; unexpectedly they have set, I cannot but adore the goodness, and tremble at the severity of God towards it; I am at a stand with <hi>Valer: Max</hi>: on the death of <hi>Cornelias</hi> husband, whether to say, it was more happy in the once injoying of them, or unhappy in the losse of them.</p>
            <p>The first was a Daughter of the right hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable family of the <hi>Pagets,</hi> and wife to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Souldier Sr. <hi>Simon Harcourt</hi> (to whose Tutelary sword the Protestants in Jreland owe much) she set at high noon, in the prime of her age, and left only one Son as the inheritor of both their virtues and honors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:65595:28"/>This last (being the Wife of the now sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Sr. <hi>Philip Harcourt</hi>) she set in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of her youth, before she had compleated twenty yeares, and hath likewise left one Son behind her, God make him the inheritor of her virtues. Both of these Ladies for beauty, bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, parts, prudence, and piety, were eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to be as honourable and Princely Dames as have trod the Stage of English earth for many ages; each of their goodnesse which made them great, was as high as their extract, which made them honorable. This last was in all probability like to outshine the first, from whose raise she received her first light and heat. Her natural and moral indowments of body and mind were both amiable, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; what is sayd of King <hi>David's</hi> Darling, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.25: was the voge of all who e're had seen her; <hi>that in all the Land there was not one to be so much praised for beauty as she; from the sole of her foot to the crown of her head there was no blemish in her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as her Person, such were her parts: her deportment was courteous, humble, and affable, yet with all, majestick; she was skild in every thing that became so high a Lady; she was knowing in History, in Physick, in Musick, in what not, she was more full of spirit and life than language; yet was her discourse for the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65595:29"/>
most part weighty and witty: she perfectly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted idlenesse; she was all the day time either retir'd in her closet at her devotions, or else writing, or reading, or playing on some musical instrument, or ordering the affaires of her house, or busied in making medicines for the poore that had no helper: Her apprehension was so quick, that a worthy gentlewoman her neighbour, with whom she much conversed, told me that she admired her above all persons for her exact knowledge in all domestick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; There was nothing within or without doores that concerned a family, but she had an insight in it. But oh! this heart cutting word (she's dead) has shipwrackt all our hopes, and fild us full of deep despondency; like a new rigg'd ship richly freighted, no sooner is she lanched forth into the world, but sinks with all her store; she had but newly shaken hands with childhood, and now, behold! grisly death like a churlish and (may we say) unwelcome Sarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant arrests her, and she must forthwith shake hands with husband, child, kindred, and bid us, and all the world eternally farewel. What heart relents not here? 'tis worse than marble if it doe not: marble it selfe will weep at change of weather, and shall not we at such a change? especially we that knew how sweet her disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how gracious her conversation was among us. Wonder not then if I your Orator make

               </gap>ble, if not commendable, from him, whose eyes make up the paragoge. The Person that here lyes in state before us, and is thus become the sad object of our sorrow, was of no low extract, she was the daughter of the honourable Sr. <hi>William Waller.</hi> On the Mothers side, she descended of the Right honourable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Finches,</hi> the Earles of Winchelsie. But these things she counted but <hi>membrana di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitatis,</hi> she no more valued the gaudy pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the world, than her body now minds this her pompous funeral, being dead, and herein she shewed her selfe, like that honorable Lady and St. <hi>Marcella</hi> (of whom St. <hi>Hierom</hi> thus speaks) <hi>quod facta est contempta nobilitate nobilior,</hi> that she did the more innoble her selfe in disregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her noble birth. That which she most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, with a holy kind of boasting, to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in, was the truly noble and religious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation she received from her Mother in law, (for her own Mother dyed in her infancy) of whose excellent virtues she never thought she could spake enough; I have oft heard her most devoutly blesse God for that Mother in law: like <hi>Alexander</hi> the great that praised his Instructor beyond him that got him. 'Tis highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble she was the instrument of instilling grace into her heart in her tender years, which made
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65595:30"/>
her, so hartily praise the God of grace for her; nor was there any love lost betwixt them; for so highly did the Mother in law prize this her Daughter in law, that she bestowed the chiefest jewel she had in the World upon her, her on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son; as conceiving her Son could be in none more happy, than in this Person: she real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being for sweetnesse of nature, amiablenesse of Person, quicknesse of wit, solidity of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, noblenesse of Spirit, innocency of life, &amp; heavenlinesse of affection, the crown and glory of her age and Sex. What single excellencies made other Ladies eminent, as this for wit, that for beauty, one for modesty, the other for affability, you might have found them all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred in this single Person, and shining there in their full lustre. Take her in any, in every of her relations, as a Daughter, Sister, Wife, Mistresse, Freind, she fild up each of these to the top. I must but touch on these. As a Daughter how full of duty and affection? who can come forth and tell the time that ever she willingly displeased either her Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all her life time? As a Sister from the nurses brests to natures bed, the grave, she lived and dyed top-full of hearty love and tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to them, their teares for the losse of her, sufficiently testify to the world this truth. As a Wife she was so full of respect, tendernesse and overflowing love to her Dear, (as she call'd
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65595:30"/>
her husband) that you would have deemd their whole life to have been but one wedding day. There was no ebb to be seen in the tide of her affections, 'twas always high, they seemd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ravisht in each others love, she was to her Husband as the pleasant hynd, the desire of his eyes, and the joy of his heart. I may truly say of them, as <hi>David</hi> said of <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> they were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and I may adde this too, in their deaths they were not divided, for at her departure, his soule as unwilling to stay, now strugled in a tyde of teares to launch out after her. This current runs still too strong, which cals rather for our pitie than our blame, and of the two extreames, this is the more alowable, as bespeaking the Person, generous and noble hearted; for none but fooles, and sordid Cowards are hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Therefore Homer describes his valiant men, his Heroes, to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, tender hearted compassionate men, men full of teares: but what need excuses here? she was his Wife, the one halfe of him selfe, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his life, the crown of his glory; how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny losses are comprehended in this one? the losse of a good and gracious Wife? none can tell but they that feel it. As a Governesse of a family, her prudence and piety was eminent, she had such a provident and diligent inspection into every thing, that she seemed to be every
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65595:31"/>
body in it: and with such facility and sedate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse she ordered all things, as if she had been no body in it. I know many great families, but never yet did I see any that was govern'd with so little noise or tumult, and so free from disorders; no oathes, no drunkennesse, no rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or dissentions to be heard or seen amongst any. 'Tis true, the family was extraordinary happy in a stock of civil, knowing, faithful, and religious Servants; and 'twas her goodnesse made them so. Such was her pious care of her family, that she desired that all her Servants might be the Lords; and therefore twice a day she commanded every one (all businesse lay'd aside) to be present in her chappel at prayers, and the hearing of God's word read; and once a week every servant from the chiefest to the meanest, she had chatechized in the principles of religion by her Chaplain in the open Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. On the Lord's day her care was, that she and her house might serve the Lord, therefore she strictly commanded all that possibly could, to attend her to the publick ordinances, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she constantly resorted to hear the word of God; and if any Servant were negligent or tardie, I have heard them sharply rebuked. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the publick ordinances were over she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all her Maid Servants into her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where she examined them all what they remembred of the Sermon, and would incourage
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65595:31"/>
the diligent hearers. After this she would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Sermon for the help of their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, &amp; then She would conclude with prayer. Thus this Princely Lady, to her eternall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, disdained not (as too many great Ladies doe) to become the hand-maids of the Lord in using all good means to save others souls as wel as her own.</p>
            <p>As a Neighbour, she was so familiar, humble, courteous and compassionate, that you need not wonder to see <hi>Stanton Harcourt</hi> so full of teares for the losse of her. Such was her charity to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in distresse, especially to those that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeous, (and therefore modest,) that when she heard or supposed they were in distresse, she would send privately to them, not pence, but pounds. Such was her privasy in it, that nothing, but the gratitude of the receivers, since her death hath informed me of this truth. By this we may guesse at her inlarged noble heart; we shall never hear all her good deeds of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, till God call her out &amp; reward her openly.</p>
            <p>That of her publike charity, you that hear me of this parish can witnesse, and my eyes have seen, that there was not a day in the week, but severall hungry bellyes were filled from her Kitchin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> once a week there was purposely made provision for them, and once a year Six of the poor of the parish were new cloathed by her,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65595:32"/>
so that we may aply <hi>Iobes</hi> words to her, <hi>the blessing of those that were ready to perish came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her.</hi> How oft has she sent and come to your houses when you have been sick to visit, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and comfort you? what good office did she ever neglect amongst you? she was as eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, a physician to the sick, and a mother to the poore. I may apply St <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms</hi> words of <hi>Nepotian</hi> to this Lady, <hi>ita curam gessit pauperum quasi ab eos genuisset, ita servivit quasi ab iis geni<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a fuisset</hi>; she wasso tender of the poor as if she had been their mother, so serviceable, as if their daughter.</p>
            <p>As a private Christian, she was (by report of her Chaplain and others most intimate with her) one of a thousand, her discourse would be so spiritual &amp; heavenly, that the Godly hearers have profess'd themselves even ravish'd with it. She was much in fasting and prayer, in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, meditation, &amp; searching her heart. I might here insert all which that learned Oratorin his funeral speech hath said of the Mother in law, so exactly did she tread in that holy Lady's steps.</p>
            <p>She kept in her Cabinet a large paper booke, so privately that none, no not her husband knew of it; since her death I have seen it, and only seen it. Twas a book, I perceived, designed to be her souls looking-glas, or rather her souls recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory, both; In this book (I perceived by the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65595:32"/>
severall heads in it) she laid up het spirituall Cordials, to refresh her soul in time of need: Here she had set down Gods gracious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable providences to her and her family, to excite her soul to thankfulnesse: Here she laid up spirituall directions how to order her life. One paper being loose I obtein'd it, I will give it you word for word, &amp; by this you may guess at the rest.</p>
            <p>April 14, 1664. <hi>I have this day upon serious examination of my heart, found this to be my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> 1. <hi>That I doe desire to love God, and to love him for himself above all things.</hi> 2. <hi>That I am (if my heart deceive me not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> extreamely more in love with the wayes of God then ever.</hi> 3. <hi>That I find my heart unfainedly sorry for all my frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes and sins committed, and duties omitted, and I doe here in the presence of God promise, &amp; engage to strive against all my beloved sins, and serve him more constantly then I have done, &amp; I hope through Gods grace, that as he has begun that good work in me, so he will according to his promises perfect it in me.</hi> Thus I have given you a glimps of this young Saints Closet works; she was not perfum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her self with essences, painting her face, or trying where a black patch would set with most advantage, and best insnare the eye of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; but she was tyreing her soul for her Lord the Bridegroomes comming. Oh thou blessed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65595:33"/>
Soul! hee whom thou hast served so secretly, will one day reward thee openly.</p>
            <p>I cannot omit one remarkeable thing, which happened a little before God called this young Saint to her sick bed: I received it since her death from a Person of good credit, who heard her tel it: She had a dream that an Angel came to her, and told her she must suddenly dye, whereat she was affraid and trembled, but the Angel told her, she need not fear, she should goe to heaven to Christ, who would wellcome her there, whereat she was fill'd with joy.</p>
            <p>Now though I lay little stresse upon dreames, as knowing it to be dangerous, it being hard to discern them from Diabolicall delusions; the Papists ridiculously impose upon the world their Fryers dreames, to prove their fopperies, and erronious opinions, as if with the Heathen, we were to believe. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> every dream came from God, whe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eas the Devill many times is the Authour of them: A wicked man may dream he shall goe to heaven, <hi>Caesar</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, may dream he shall goe to the immortal God, but no wicked man, shall ever goe thither. Yet for all this it must not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but that God doth many times foretell to his Saints their deaths in dreames: <hi>Polycarp</hi> that Saint and Martyr (you may find him in the book of Martyrs) had his death foretold him, &amp;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65595:33"/>
the kind of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He dreamt that his bed was on fire under him; and St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> foresaw in a dream the Pro-Consul writing his sentence to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pont. Diaco. in vit. Cyp.</hi>
               </note> whereupon he desired him to set his house in order, and twas granted him; and just so it fell out as he had dreamed. We might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in many more if it needed. For my part I believe this dream of this holy Ladys, was a favour extraordinary from God to such a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous young Saint. And I the rather think so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it so fell out as she had dreamed; for soon after this, she unexpectedly fell sick of a violent feaver, which was the forerunner of death at hand. And although she did not dye of that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet before she had recovered her strength she lost by it, God in his wise providence (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to exercise her graces before she went hence) call'd her back again to her sick bed, which at last proved her death bed. In this Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse God exercised her with more tormentive pangs, both in her back and bowels then before; which inforced most bitter groanes and sighs from her, to the peircing of the hearts of those about her: yet under all those heavy pressures she did not charge God foolishly, though she groaned, yet she did not murmur or repine, but in the midst of those pangs she still lifted up her hand and eyes to the God of her salvation: That time of ease God gave her between her fits, she
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65595:34"/>
was carefull to redeem by prayer, and other holy exercises with her Chaplain, whom she highly prized in her health, for his singular good parts and piety. Some few dayes before her death, when her excessive pangs had so devoured her strength, that they left her speechlesse, and the company gave her up for a dying, departing person, I came to her bed side, and perceiving her to move her head and her eyes, which was more then she had done for some hours before, I asked her Ladyship whether she were capable of discourse, and she answered me, yes, but let it be good, let it be heavenly: So carefull was she to redeeme her sick bed time; you may guesse where her treasure was by her heart. The day before her death was (to all our joy and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration) the most refreshing day she had had in all her sicknesse. <hi>Sic Phoebi j<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m cadentis dulcius esse solet lumen</hi>: As a fair day often rears exhalations into a cloud, which next day returns in showers upon us, so did this pleasant Monday returne its dark clouds of sorrow and showres of teares on Tuesday; for then her disease seizing her head took away her speech, and so depriv'd us, no doubt, of many gracious speeches which would have fallen from her dying lips. Yet what she could not doe in words, she did in signes. She some houres before her death took her woman by the hand, and shooke it, to let
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65595:34"/>
her know she was heartily reconciled to her notwithstanding some tart words, that had some dayes before passed betwixt them. In the after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noon of <hi>Aug.</hi> 23. 1664. God was pleased gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously to release her of all her pangs: Her soul willingly and joyfully departed, and hath left behind, what of mortality it had for us to lay up in the house of all the living.</p>
            <p>And now, what can alleviate our sorrows for so great a losse? But, is she lost? no, the losse is ours, she's the great gainer. As <hi>L. Florus</hi> saith of the City <hi>Alba,</hi> twas pulled down, to be set up in Rome to its higher honour &amp; advantage: this Lady is but taken down here, to be set up in heaven to her unspeakeable honour &amp; advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o heart this blessed Saints Translation; could we but stil our sorrowes a little while, &amp; lend an ear to listen what the Saints on the otherside the lake of death do say, it would not be the voice of those that cry for being overcome, but the voice of those that sing, the voice of those that shout for victory, that we should hear.</p>
            <p>Doe we believe the person that's departed was a true servant of God? I think you doe: and we may as confidently say of her, a St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> does of <hi>Nepotian, Scimus Nepatianum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum esse cum Christo</hi>; we verily believe she is with Christ. Why then doe you so immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65595:35"/>
grieve? <hi>Cur doleas</hi> (saith <hi>Tertullian) si peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse non credis, cur impatienter feras subductum interim quem credis reuersurum esse</hi>? So say I, why doe we so take on for her who we know is not gone to be lost, but only with drawn for a time, and we believe will return again? did the Church mourne when <hi>Peter</hi> was delivered out of Prison, and his shackles knock'd off? A Saint at death is freed from prison, and all his fetters are then knockt off. Did <hi>Mordicai</hi> weep and grieve, or had he cause, when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the world tooke his Niece from him out of love he bare her, to advance her above all other weomen, and make her Queen? This This is the case (only the former paralel is too short) the great Creatour of the world in great compassion and tender love to this young Lady, has taken her betimes from the dirty country to preferre her at Court, he has called her early from this beggarly low earth, to advance her amongst the mighty in the heavens.</p>
            <p>The Heathen <hi>Menander</hi> could say <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>akes soonest. Her soul being fledg'd betimes, tooke wing for heaven, and this curious robe of mortality, which she put off at her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we now are carrying with all solemnity into the suburbs of heaven after her; for Saints graves are no otherwise, they are next door to

heaven. They are the Saints sleeping Chambers for a little while, till God call them up again. The silence of the grave is but a kind of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorean</hi>

               </gap>, a restraint only for a time, and that but a little time, the time is short. Death the last enimy, shall reign but a little longer; he must resign his keyes ere long. When the trumpet sounds, death triumphs cease, till then the Saints bodyes in the grave are in the safe custody of Christ, as their Souls in heaven, and Christ at his coming will as certainly unite them and clothe them with immortality and glory. Wherefore let us comfort one another up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this sad occasion with these meditations.</p>
            <p>One living relict of this Lady, now with God, remaines still with us, (her Son) and is her lively picture; for whom I pray, as Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent St <hi>Ambros</hi> at the death of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> the Emperour, (only changing one Article) <hi>Tu solus domine, invocandus, tu rogandus es, ut eam infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio repraesentes.</hi> That he may resemble her in soul, as well as in countenance.
