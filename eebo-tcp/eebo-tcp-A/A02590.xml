            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S we haue houſes of our owne, ſo God hath his; yea, as great men haue more houſes then one, ſo hath the Great God of Heauen much more; more, both
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15579:5"/>
in ſucceſſion (as here, the latter houſe, and the firſt) and in varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: He hath an houſe of fleſh <hi>(Ye are the Temples of the liuing God;)</hi> An houſe of ſtone; (Salomon <hi>ſhal build me an houſe;)</hi> An houſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall in the Heauens, 2. Cor. 5. 1. Wherefore then hath God an houſe? Wherefore haue we ours; but to dwell in? But doth not he himſelfe tell <hi>Dauid,</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Stephen</hi> the Protomartyr (vpon whoſe day we are falne) tell the Iewes, that <hi>He dwells not in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples made with hands?</hi> True; Hee dwells not in his Houſe, as we in ours, by way of comprehenſion; he dwells in it by teſtification of preſence. So doe we dwell in our houſes, that our houſes containe vs, that we are only within them,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15579:5"/>
and they without vs. So doth he dwell in his, that yet hee is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, yea, euerywhere, that his houſe is within him. Shortly, God dwells where he witneſſes his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence, that, becauſe hee doth both in the Empyreall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, amongſt his Angels and Saints, and in his Church vpon Earth; therefore his dwelling is both in the higheſt Heauen in perfect glory; &amp; on Earth, in the hearts and aſſemblie of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. As of the former, our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith; <hi>Jn domo Patris mei, Jn my Fathers houſe are many Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> So alſo may wee ſay of the latter, There is much varietie and choice in it; There was the Church of the Iewes, the Church of the Gentiles; There is a materiall,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15579:6"/>
and a ſpirituall houſe. In the one, <hi>Salomons, Zorobabels,</hi> ſuch piles as this: In the other; ſo much multiplicitie, as there are Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yea, Congregations that profeſſe the name of Chriſt. One of theſe was a figure of the other, the Materiall, vnder the Law; of the Spirituall, vnder the Goſpell. Yee ſee now the firſt houſe, and the latter, the ſubject of our Text and diſcourſe. The latter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to vs comparatiuely, poſitiuely. Comparatiuely with the former, <hi>Maior gloria.</hi> Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, in it ſelfe, <hi>Jn this place will J giue peace.</hi> Both, ſet out by the ſtile of the promiſer, and avower; <hi>ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> All which challenge your Chriſtian atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:15579:6"/>
As the firſt houſe (which was materiall) was a figure of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which is ſpirituall: ſo the glorie of that materiall, was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the glorie of this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Now becauſe all the life and glorie of the ſpirituall, ſtands in Chriſt the Meſſias, the Prophet lookes through the type of the material, at him which ſhal beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, yea, glorifie the ſpirituall, of whoſe exihibition the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Adhuc modicum, Yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, and J will ſhake the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens.</hi> This <hi>Modicum</hi> was but ſome 500. and odde yeeres; much to men, but a <hi>modicum</hi> to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of dayes, with whom 1000. yeeres are but one day. It is in and by him, that this latter houſe vnder the Goſpell, ſhall in glorie
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15579:7"/>
ſurpaſſe that firſt vnder the Law. The Prophets had ſpoken glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of the Temple that ſhould be; and now, leſt when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould ſee the homely and cottagelike reedification of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel,</hi> they ſhould be diſ-hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and offended, the Prophet deſires to draw their eyes from the ſtone and timber, to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall inſide of the Euangelicall Church, ſhewing the glorie of this latter Houſe, to exceed the former.</p>
            <p>Some groſſe Interpreters haue lookt with Iewiſh eyes vpon the outward fabrick, which was threefold: <hi>Salomons, Zorobabels, Herods. Salomons,</hi> ſumptuous and magnificent; <hi>Zorobabels,</hi> meane and homely; <hi>Herods,</hi> rich and maieſticall,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15579:7"/>
               <hi>immodico ſumptu, incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili ſplendore,</hi> as one ſayes. <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> was before defaced. Now becauſe <hi>Zorobabels</hi> was ſo farre from making this Word good, that the people wept, when they ſaw the difference (which <hi>Caluin</hi> well obſerues, was not without a ſpeciall prouidence of the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God; elſe the Iewes would ſo haue fixed their eyes vpon the outward ſplendor, that they would neuer haue looked for the ſpirituall and inward Grace of the Houſe of God:) therefore they haue taken it of <hi>Herods</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the walls and lining where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were indeed anſwerable to this Propheſie, more glorious. But this conceit, as it is too car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, ſo is quite diſſonant from the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15579:8"/>
context, both in regard of the precedents, and ſubſequents. Of the precedents: For, how did the deſire of all Nations come to that Pile of <hi>Herods?</hi> Of the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents: For, what peace was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Herodian Temple? Firſt, the builder of it, was the chiefe oppreſſor of the Iewiſh libertie: and then ſecondly, it gaue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the perpetuall miſerie of that people. <hi>Pilate</hi> would expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Treaſures of it for <hi>aquae ductae;</hi> which denied, coſt the Iewes much blood. Vnder <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> twenty thouſand ſlaine in a Feaſt of vnleauened bread. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathas</hi> the Prieſt ſlaine by theeues ſuborned by <hi>Foelix,</hi> in the very Temple; and euer after, it was the harbour and ſpoyle of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15579:8"/>
What hills of Carcaſſes? What ſtreames of blood was in't at the laſt vaſtation? Enough to amaze any Reader: ſo as in that 79. yeeres wherein it ſtood (lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it did not,) it was no better then a ſtage of Tragedies, a ſhambles of crueltie. Of that therefore God could not ſay, <hi>Dabo pacem;</hi> it was <hi>Templum adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terinum,</hi> as one calls it iuſtly, and had neither command nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: It was the Spirituall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Euangelicall Church, whoſe glory ſhal be greater then the Iewiſh, which ſhall be bleſſed with the deſire of the Nations, with the aſſurance of Peace. But why then doth the holy Ghoſt ſpeake of Gold and Siluer, the coſtly materials of an outward
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15579:9"/>
ſtructure? Euen theſe very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are figuratiue: not that God cares ſo much for them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee doe; becauſe our eyes vſe to bee dazled with this beſt parcell of Earth; therefore when hee would deſcribe a glorious Church, he borrowes the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Gold, Siluer, precious Stones, Eſay 60. and euen by theſe doth he ſet forth his New and Heauenly Ieruſalem, Reuel. 21. Wherein then is the glory of Gods Euangelicall Houſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then of the Legall? Yea, wherein is it not greater? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yee looke to the efficient, the matter, the duration, the extent, the ſeruice. The efficient, that was built by man, tho directed by God: In this, God himſelfe is the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15579:9"/>

               <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> was the <hi>Ianus</hi> of both Teſtaments; he was to the Churches, as <hi>Noah</hi> was to the Worlds; he ſaw both the firſt, and

I ſtand not vpon examining the compariſon, whether it bee <hi>ratione ſanctitatis,</hi> or <hi>officii;</hi> it makes either way for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, therfore was <hi>John</hi> ſo great,<note place="margin">The leaſt of the greateſt is more, then the greateſt of the leaſt.</note> becauſe he was the laſt of the law, and the firſt of the Goſpell: and the old rule is <hi>minimum maximi maius eſt maximo minimi;</hi> therfore is the leaſt in this Kingdome of Grace greater then he, becauſe

            <p>Yee ſhall now giue me leaue (Right Honourable) to carrie theſe words in a meet analogie to the preſent occaſion.

make his Word good, That the glorie of this latter Houſe ſhall bee greater, then of the former. The firſt foundation of it was, no doubt, both pious and rich.

It is true, we are bidden euery where to lift vp pure hands to God: but they cannot bee pure, that are profane; and they cannot be but profane, that contemne the holy ordinances of God.

It is he onely, that when the Diſciples were toſſed with contrary winds and threatning billowes, could command the winds and waues to a calme. It is hee onely, that when his Church is toſſed with the winds and waues of raging and impetuous enmitie, can giue outward peace.

Thoſe who hauc the aduantage of the warre, may command peace: vnderlings muſt ſtoope to ſuch conditions, as the victor will yeeld. To ſhew vs therefore how eaſily he can giue peace, God ſtiles himſelfe the God of Hoſts; a title wherein he takes no ſmall delight, referring not to the being of the creature, but to their marſhalling; not to their naturall eſtate, but their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie; neither would God bee lookt at in it, as a Creator, but as a Generall. In but two of the Prophets, <hi>Eſay</hi> and <hi>Ieremy,</hi> no leſſe then an hundred and thirtie times hath hee this ſtile giuen him. Euery thing, as it hath an

againſt the Scepter of the Kingdome (that is, the Goſpell) of Ieſus Chriſt.

            <p>Yea, why are we apalled, when we ſee the meaſures of the ſonnes of <hi>Anak;</hi> the ſpirituall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in heauenly places? If wee looke at their number, they are Legions. If to their ſtrength, they are Principalities and Powers.

If to their nature, they are ſpirits that rule in the ayre. Wee are men, fleſh and blood, ſingle, weake, ſinfull. What euer we are, our God is in Heauen, and doth whatſoeuer hee will; hee is the Lord of Hoſts; though Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards in our ſelues, yet in him wee are more then Conquerors; hee who is more then All power, then All truth, hath ſaid it; The Gates of Hell ſhall not preuaile againſt his Church. Thanks be to God, which giueth vs victory, through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, he is the Lord of Hoſts; his vndertakings are infallible: Hath hee ſaid, that the glory of the Euangelicall Church ſhall exceede the Legall? Hath hee ſaid, that, <hi>In this place he will giue</hi>
