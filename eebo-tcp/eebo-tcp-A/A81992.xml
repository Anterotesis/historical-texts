         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>REader, this is a bookiſh-age, and whereas Learning was heretofore graced by judicious Schollars, it is now much vilified by illiterate ſcriblers. What <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaid of France, <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſcribendi datur libertas, paucis facultas;</hi> All men may write, but few are able to write; is verified here in England: All have liberty to write, but few ability. Hence it is that ſo many leane pamphlets and peices come forth daily, treating of Inferiour and inconſiderate things. This Author ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints you with the great <hi>Shakings,</hi> the great <hi>Alterations,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> do make in Heaven and Earth upon performance of divine Promiſes: He treats of the uſe and miniſtration of Angels therein; he ſheweth that all power is Chriſts; that the Princes of the earth have all their power from him; he informes of what uſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Governours are, how ſubject
<pb facs="tcp:170142:5"/>
to change; whats the evil of abuſing power, whats the cauſe of Civil Wars and Fatal Turnes; He tells you how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely the Lord Chriſt will deale with the Potentates of the earth, whoſe power is erected againſt him and his; which are things of an high nature, and well handled. Though <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid of <hi>Moſes</hi> workes, <hi>Multa dicit, nil probat;</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of <hi>Manichaeus, dixit &amp; abiit,</hi> he gave no reaſon of what he ſaid; yet it is far otherwiſe with this Author, who judiciouſly and ſolidly makes good what he hath aſſerted. The Matter, Method, and Compoſition, are waters from his own Ciſtern, and hony from his own Hive. He hath not lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his book <hi>alieno adipe,</hi> with the fat of other men. The work ſpeakes for it ſelfe, being elaborate, well compacted, and weighty through words of truth; and doubtleſſe will finde acceptance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe who have their ſenſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd to diſcern of ſuch things. Its moſt true which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nihil moroſius hominum judiciis;</hi> nothing is more peeviſh then the judgements of men: what one magnifies, another vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies; and what is vilified by one, is
<pb facs="tcp:170142:6"/>
magnified by another; yet it is ſome comfort that mens judgements are like their pallats; what ſuites not with one doth with another; and where the wine is good, few will diſtaſte it. Reader, buy and try; if thou be pleaſured or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, the Author hath his aime; if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he will not be provoked, knowing <hi>Nunquam tam bene agitur cum rebus humanis ut meliora placeant plurimis;</hi> Such is the diſpoſition of humane affairs, that the beſt things ever pleaſe feweſt.</p>

               </gap>l by the name of a <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>an houſe,</hi> which is the language of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> to ſpeak out Gods way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but here, it hath a farther extent, even unto <hi>Goſpel-worſhip,</hi> and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that is according to the ſecond Prop.</p>

               <hi>Shaking of heaven and earth</hi> doth not onely meane the commotion in theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bodies, and the alterations therein; but alſo theſe words hold out, the change in the great Political bodies of Church and State; and ſo according to the third propoſition are to be taken in the largeſt extent.</p>
            <p>Again, obſerve this promiſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Haggai</hi> receives (according to what is laid down in the fourth propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) ſundry degrees of fulfilling. It was truly performed when Chriſt was born into the world; then Angels and Men, Heaven and Earth were moved; but this is not all; for the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews tells us</hi> of another <hi>ſhaking</hi> at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coming of Chriſt when we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>a Kingdome that cannot be moved,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:170142:26"/>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 26. Beſides when the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> names <hi>the Temple and the Houſe,</hi> he meanes all the frame of worſhip, and not barely the Fabrick and building that was reared up. When he names <hi>Zoroba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel and Joſhua,</hi> he meanes not onely thoſe two particular perſons, but all govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and deliverers of Gods people, in ſeveral places and ages are included, which is the direction that the fifth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition gives us.</p>
            <p>Moreover the great and glorious alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations that God will make in theſe laſt dayes, is here expreſſed by a phraſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Gods wonderful dealing with his people Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we finde <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 18. <note place="margin">Exod. 19. 18.</note>at the appearance of God on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> its ſaid <hi>the wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>ſhaking of all Nations</hi> here, what doth it meane elſe but the execution of vengeance on the Nations? thus plainly in <hi>v.</hi> 21. 22. of this 2. Chap. where the <hi>ſhaking of heaven and ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170142:27"/>
good, which was the leſſon taught in the eight propoſition.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the time of theſe great turnes is plainly expreſſed to be at the <hi>coming of Chriſt:</hi> Chriſt is yet to come in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all, one way or another, and all his comings produce notable changes, as the eight propoſition ſhewed. And thus having brought down what was ſpoken in general, in the propoſitions, to this particular propheſie of <hi>Haggai;</hi> I ſhall onely adde one word about the coherence of theſe two verſes, with the former part of the Chapter, and then deſcend to the explication of the words.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> It's plain, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and 3. that <hi>Zorobabel, Joſhua</hi> and the <hi>people</hi> were under diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement about building of the Temple: <hi>we</hi> build a Temple (ſay they) but what is it? a poor meane frame: <hi>Solomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was a ſtately Edifice, but this is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> to that: were it not better for us to give over, then to goe forward with <hi>ſuch</hi> a work? Now in the fourth and fifth verſe, God calls upon them: 1. To be ſtrong; be ſtrong, be ſtrong. 2. To <hi>worke</hi> and not give over. 3. To be confident and not feare. Now the Arguments are three. 1. I am with you, <hi>v.</hi> four. 2. My Spirit ſhall remain among you, <hi>v.</hi> five. 3. I will ſhake Heaven and earth for you, and the deſire of all Nations ſhall come and fill this houſe with glory, <hi>v.</hi> 6. &amp; 7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:170142:27"/>
So then theſe words are brought in as an argument to take off their feare, and render them confident, to ſtrengthen them in the work God called them unto: Thus they cohere with the former words; let us now proceed to explication of them: we ſhall begin with thoſe words.</p>

            <p>You have heard the meaning of theſe words (Thus ſaith the Lord) that they hold out a promiſe, and that the Lords ſaying is not a bare expreſſing of a thing to be ſo or ſo; but an expreſſion with an engagement of himſelfe; its a ſaying by way of a promiſe: Hence we ſhall begin with this obſervation.</p>

               <hi>It was a great turne when all the world was drowned; and then how doth God diſpenſe himſelf? he makes a</hi> Covenant with Noah, Gen. <hi>9. 13.</hi> I will ſet my bow in <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 13.</note>the clouds, and it ſhall be a token of Covenant between me and the Earth.</p>
            <p>It was no ſmall turne when <hi>Terah</hi> and others were grosſly defiled by Idolatry, then for God to call <hi>Abraham</hi> out; but how doth he doe it? by making a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, Gen.</hi> 17. 4. <hi>Behold my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>

            <p>Heaven and Earth in their prime and litteral ſignification, hold out that great

frame that God in the beginning formed out of nothing. Now in this great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke are the alterations we ſpeak of. I ſhould not have pitched on this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but that I finde the holy Ghoſt in all the eminent turns to make ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and mention this way. It was a great turne reduced all the world to eight perſons; but then you know the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of <hi>Heaven were opened,</hi> and <hi>the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the great deep broken up,</hi> and the <hi>raine was upon the Earth, Gen.</hi> 7. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>To turne Iſrael out of Egyptian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage was a great turne, and then the <hi>Red Sea muſt be dryed up, Exod.</hi> 14. 16.</p>

            <p>Why doth Chriſt when he intends great

turnes in States, make ſuch changes in Heaven and Earth?</p>
            <p>I anſwer in four Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Reaſ. 1. Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to take his power.</note> This is the beginning of Chriſt his <hi>taking to himſelfe his great power, Rev.</hi> 11. 17. Chriſt hath all power on earth, as well as in heaven; he is ſovereigne Lord of all creatures, as well as King of Saints. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>He is the Firſt borne of every creature, as well as head of the Church,</hi> and therefore he doth <hi>thus</hi> manifeſt himſelfe. There be many fore-runners before the King comes; reckon theſe among the leaſt and loweſt of Chriſts ſervants, yet ſurely what knees they have they bend to him. They are ready with their motion, and conjunctions to honour him, and in their language to tell you of his tranſcendent glory that is following. They are obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and ſtep aſide out of their ordinary way to let you know of their Lords drawing nigh. <hi>Chriſt</hi> could deal with Kingdomes and Nations without theſe <hi>Signes:</hi> But ſince he hath theſe creatures, he will make uſe of them; yea and their extravagances ſhall do him good ſervice. Men ſtop their eares at the voyce of the ordinary courſe of Heaven and Earth, and will not hear; but when he turnes their courſes into <hi>Signes</hi> and wonders, <note place="margin">Reaſ. 2. Speakes to all the world.</note>then they ſhall heare.</p>
            <p>By this meanes he ſpeakes to all the World: when <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe ſpeaks, it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170142:42"/>
muſt be with a mighty voyce. We low creatures doe but mutter and whiſper, and few there be that heare our voyce; but when <hi>he ſpeaks,</hi> heaven and earth, and all the world ſhall heare him. When he ſpeakes by the word of his Goſpel, <hi>every creature muſt hear, Mar.</hi> 16. 15. and his Apoſtles which were the Teachers, they muſt have the gift of tongues, and be able to ſpeak the language of every Nation where they come, that ſo the Parthians, Medes and Elamites might heare as well as the Jewes. <hi>Their line is gone out into all the earth, Pſal.</hi> 19. 4. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath another way of ſpeaking to all the world, namely by <hi>ſignes in heaven and earth;</hi> thoſe that will not hear his Goſpel, yet will liſten to their language. Signes have their voyce, as well as men, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>If they will not believe the voyce of the firſt ſigne.</hi> Turkes, Jewes, Heathens, Prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which regard not the ſound of the Goſpel; yet will <hi>now</hi> be <hi>Auriti,</hi> quick of hearing: as Chriſt in his preaching ſpake, as one having authority; So he ſpeakes now, and commands attention. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 23. <hi>The poor uſeth intreaties,</hi> and its the poverty of Chriſts meſſengers that they come beſeeching, and intreating; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe ſpeakes in a commanding way, to let all men know, bad as well as good, that he is about his worke, and his great work. Earthly men minde the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170142:43"/>
earth, ſpeak of it, account it their own; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> will meet them there, and ſpeake from, and by the <hi>Earth</hi> to them.</p>

               <note place="margin">Reaſ. 3.

The Mathematical Bee, and the Artificial Spider, make their combs, and houſes, according to the rules of reaſon; yet they know not what they do: So thoſe creatures ſerve, but not according to their prime end, though they know it not; yet God knowes it, and will right it, and by uſing of them in this extraordinary way, he tells us ſo, and would not ſuffer them thus to groane but that he knowes how to honour himſelfe and reſtore them. <note place="margin">Reaſ. 4.

            <p>By theſe Turnes and appearances in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bodies <hi>Chriſt</hi> knowes how to draw forth ſpiritual actings in his people: Let it thunder, or lighten, though his people are aſſured of his love, and favour, and that they lie in his boſome; yet they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine him in that his voyce with an awful feare and reverence; that his mighty voyce makes them in a holy way to tremble, and yet to truſt. When ſignes are in Heaven and Earth, Saints reſt not in the admiration of what they ſee, or hear, but ſearch into the bleſſed word of truth, for the meaning of thoſe ſignes.

               <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Shall there be evil in the City and I the Lord have not done it? Chriſt</hi> then hath his work in City or National good or evil.</p>
            <p>Poſ. 2. <hi>All the Kings of the earth reigne by Chriſt.</hi> Kings are the greateſt perſons of the earth, and cauſe the greateſt Turns and Changes, either to good or evil. How is our feare and ſorrow turned into hope and joy, when righteous men are exalted to government? and what mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when wicked ones? <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 2. How much of the increaſe of wickedneſſe is abated, by their power, care, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample? and what great cauſe have Saints to bleſſe God, when he makes Rulers <hi>nurſing fathers,</hi> and to rule <hi>for him</hi> as they rule <hi>by him?</hi>

            <p>Poſ. 3. <hi>Government is ſet up for the good of the World,</hi> and nothing cauſeth more conſiderable changes then <hi>that</hi> doth: it reduceth lawleſſe ones to <hi>a rule;</hi> ruleth and boundeth exceſſive deſires and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; brings in trade and wealth, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of creatures, and increaſe of peace.</p>
            <p>Poſ. 4. <hi>Government in the frame of it is apt to change,</hi> and doth not that reach us?

Poſ. 5. <hi>Kings and Princes have abuſed their power;</hi> that is a ſad change, a change of what ſhould be beſt, to worſt, of power to abuſe of it: of Kings to Tyrants, of Princes to Oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>Poſ. 6. <hi>Sins of Princes tend to break their power.</hi> Here is change upon change: Change of Manners by ſin, and change of Wholneſſe and Soundneſſe to a breach. Power cannot break but many things break with it, and many things cannot break but it makes great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</p>
            <p>Poſ. 7. <hi>Princes being wicked, people grow wicked too;</hi> a woful change indeed, and much to be lamented; Princes that ſhould rule, become ſlaves, and that to the worſt of maſters, their <hi>own Luſts;</hi> people that ſhould be under command, to become unruly, and unruly by them that ſhould better order them.</p>
            <p>Poſ. 8. <hi>Abuſe of power and wickedneſſe of people adapt to Civil War.</hi> Thoſe in power complain of the people, and the people of them in power; and we have juſt cauſe to complaine of both. Its a ſad caſe, that turnes the ſoul to a wearineſſe of the good it doth poſſeſſe, and to a loathing its own peace.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Poſ. 10. We fall out one with another, and our neighbours fall out with us both. How do they laugh at us, and ſeek to raiſe themſelves out of our ruines?

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was laid down in the fifth Chapter,</p>
            <p>That when <hi>Chriſt</hi> works great changes in Kingdomes and Common-wealths, he ſheweth <hi>ſignes in the heaven above, and in the earth beneath;</hi> and that occaſioned this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</p>
            <p>Queſt. Whether thoſe <hi>ſignes in heaven</hi> which Chriſt ſheweth, do not favour or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance <hi>Aſtrological Predictions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. To which I anſwer negatively. Thoſe Signes that Chriſt ſheweth, do <hi>not</hi> in the leaſt favour their Predictions.</p>
            <p>Now that you may more fully take in the compaſſe and meaning of this anſwer, we ſhall firſt ſhew you what we <hi>grant</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Stars, and then what we <hi>deny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we grant theſe five things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Stars have a powerful ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Stars have a ruling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</note>excellency by their light, heat, and motion. They are not like the paints in a Chamber, which we look on, but they work not on us. The ſeat and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170142:152"/>
of the Stars tell us that they are not placed there to diſgrace the Heavens; but that they have that in their being which anſwers ſo high a place, and work to their ends. So <hi>Job</hi> 38. 31. <hi>Canſt thou binde the ſweet influences of the Pleiades?</hi> Stars have their influences; that is, their virtue, and power extended to others.</p>
            <p>Pſal. <hi>8. 3.</hi> When I conſider the Heavens the work of thy fingers, the Moon and the Stars which thou haſt ordained. <hi>The Stars then are Gods</hi> Ordinances, <hi>creatures or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by him, and by him for us to conſider of.</hi>

We grant that the Stars by their light, heat, and motion, do work great alteration in the Aire, the firſt heaven, as being neereſt to it; God hath placed the creatures neer one another, that they might act conjoynedly. The clearneſſe or cloudineſſe of the Aire may relate to the Stars; the Stars alſo are conſiderable in the moiſture, or dryneſſe of the Aire. If the wind be <hi>Aer motus,</hi> the <hi>Aire moved;</hi> I know not but that motion may ſome what relate to the virtue of the Stars.</p>

                  <hi>3.</hi> Stars affect di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly the compound bodies.</note> 3. We deny not but that the Stars having this power over the Aire, they do by the aire diverſly affect compound bodies that breath in this aire. This our experience teacheth us; In faire weather we are more Frollick, our ſpirits are up, we are more apt to ſing, to move cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, our phantaſies are more buſie, and our motion more pleaſant; whereas in thick foggy weather, our brains are clouded, and we are heavy and dull of Action.</p>
            <p>Heat, cold, moyſture, and dryneſſe, are the four principal qualities of compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded bodies; and ſurely the temperature of the Aire works much on theſe, as is obſervable when we are ſick.</p>

                  <hi>4.</hi> Stars are for Times and Seaſons.</note> 4. Scripture ſpeakes plainly, <hi>That they are for times and for ſeaſons, for days and for years, Gen.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The lights in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are to divide the day from the night, and to be for ſeaſons, for days and years.</hi> Seaſons are ſuch times as are proper and peculiar to ſome actions and bodies; <hi>He appointeth the Moon for ſeaſons, and the Sun knoweth his going down, Pſal.</hi> 104. 19. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ſuch portions of time, as if a man come forth to act in, he ſhall finde an advantage to his work from <hi>the time;</hi> which advantage he will miſſe if he go not forth <hi>then.</hi> Thus in <hi>ſowing,</hi> the growth and fruit depends not onely on the commiting of the ſeed to the ground,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170142:153"/>
but committing it to the ground in a certaine time, which is therefore called <hi>ſowing Seaſon:</hi> ſow before or after that time, and your labour will not thrive; and this ſheweth the goodneſſe of that promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 22. <hi>While the earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, Seed-time and Harveſt, and Cold and Heat, Summer and Winter, Day and Night, ſhall not ceaſe.</hi> Thus learned Mr. <hi>Aynſworth</hi> explaines <hi>Job</hi> 9. 9. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the four Seaſons of the year: <hi>Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the Chambers of the South: Arcturus ariſeth in September, and beginneth</hi> Autumne; <hi>Orion</hi> ariſeth in <hi>December,</hi> and beginneth <hi>Winter; Pleiades</hi> ariſeth in the Spring; and the <hi>Chambers of the South</hi> he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets of the Southerne Stars, which are for the moſt part hidden from us, as in Chambers; but ſome ariſe ſo as in <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as the Dog-ſtar.</hi>

                  <hi>5.</hi> There may be ſom e preſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</note> 5. We readily yeild that there may be ſome preſent Predictions about weather, and things contemperating therewith; ſuch as Mariners, Phyſitians, and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen make: of which we read, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 54, 55. <hi>When ye ſee a cloud riſe out of the Weſt, ſtraitway you ſay, there cometh a ſhower, and it is ſo: and when you ſee the South winde blow, you ſay there will be heat, and it cometh to paſſe.</hi> Mariners at Sea have many uſeful ſignes of winde or ſtorme to follow, and ſo accordingly
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170142:154"/>
prepare to avoid the danger. Phyſitians by the temper of the Aire, and the body of the Patient, foretel what intenſion or remiſſion of the fit there may be.</p>
            <p>Husbandmen (whoſe labour caſts them to be much abroad) are not unskillful concerning the Seaſons, and ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to order their Cattel. But theſe are vaſtly different from thoſe things which men preſume to anſwer from the Stars, although the Stars be altogether ſilent concerning them: As about Marriage, Trade, Health, or Sickneſſe, manner of Living and Dying. The confident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions about theſe things, are the darke viſions of mens wicked hearts, which the Stars give no light unto.</p>
            <p>Thus ye ſee what we grant. 1. That Stars have a ruling power. 2. Make great alterations in the Aire; and ſo, 3. On compound bodies. 4. They make times and ſeaſons. And 5. That men may from the preſent conſideration, make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of times and ſeaſons from them.</p>
            <p>That which we deny, we ſhall lay down in two Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> The Stars have no power over the Reaſon <note place="margin">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Stars have no power over the Reaſon or Will.</note>or will of men to neceſſitate or inforce them to this or that way or object.</p>
            <p>Stars cannot act immediatly on the minde to preſent this or that thing to its conſideration or <hi>apprehenſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They cannot fixe or tye down the mind to <hi>Meditation.</hi>

They cannot ſuggeſt that which is for <hi>argumentation.</hi>

            <p>They cannot directly incline the <hi>will</hi> to this or that good, to paſſe by this, and pitch upon that, or ſuſpend from either.</p>
            <p>Angels are creatures in their make and being more excellent then the Stars, acting by reaſon and will as we doe, and ſo are neerer to us: yet they have no ſuch power over us: How much leſſe the Stars? We ſay ſecondly,</p>

            <p>Now, how can they declare that, when it is uncertaine in what temperament the Stars be?</p>
            <p>Beſide the virtue of the Stars is ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together in the ſubject whereon they work: They do not work ſingly and apart on the ſubjects; as for example; <hi>Jupiter</hi> doth not worke alone without <hi>Mars,</hi> nor <hi>Mars</hi> without <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but all the Stars put forth their force and virtue together: <hi>Sol, Luna, Mercury,</hi> and the reſt work together on the Aire, and ſo on compound bodies, and ſo they are common cauſes; that is, their cauſing power is ſuch as is not proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to one conſtellation, ſo as other Stars and conſtellations do not ſhare in it; but what they put forth its common to other Stars together with them, and ſo theſe Stars with theſe Stars; and it being ſo, how can they aſcribe this or that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to one Star ſo as not to another, ſince they all cauſed together the effect?</p>

            <p>I deny not but there is an Art of the Stars, which Art God hath made, and its a beame of his wiſdome ſhining on them, which is called <hi>Aſtronomy;</hi> that is, the Law of the Stars, or that rule that God hath ſubjected the Stars unto, and our reaſon findes out. But that is not the wiſdome of God whereby he knows and foretels things to come; that wiſdome, that foreknowledge, that foreknowing wiſdome God never placed in the Stars, nor ſhall we ever finde it there.</p>
            <p>All Art is that which by our <hi>medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, arguing, obſervation,</hi> and <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> we take up out of the Creature whereof it is an Art; as in the Art of Muſicke: no man makes the Art of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,</hi> that is a creature of Gods making: onely men finde out and diſcover what God hath made; as namely, God hath made this or that proportion in ſounds

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170142:158"/>
concerning Predictions about al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Aire, about faire or foule weather. How grosſly are they miſtaken there, and how is that contradicted and condemned by our daily experience? So that I am more then three quarters perſwaded, that if one take an Almanack calculated for this preſent yeare, 1655. and where it is written fair weather, write foule, and where its written <hi>foule,</hi> write <hi>faire;</hi> where its written <hi>ſtormes,</hi> write <hi>calme;</hi> and your <hi>writing,</hi> as to the event and ſucceſſe, ſhall fall out as right as that which was firſt calculated. Part of the reaſon that induceth me into this opinion is this.</p>
            <p>Much, yea very much of weather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the <hi>winde:</hi> Now who knows twelve months before, where the winde will be twelve months after? nay who knows this day, where the winde will be to morrow?</p>
            <p>God hath not left the <hi>windes</hi> in the keeping of the <hi>Stars;</hi> but he holds them in <hi>his fiſt, and rides upon the wings of them, Pſal.</hi> 104. 3.</p>
            <p>Millions of men live and trade in the great deeps, they have their ſeveral ways; ſome Eaſtward, ſome Weſtward, ſome outward, ſome homeward bound: God knows all their wayes and occaſions, and who ſtands in moſt need of winde and weather, and he ſerves all their

turnes in his ſeaſon; and ſo turnes wind and weather as he thinks good, without acquainting the Stars with it.</p>
            <p>Now if they miſtake ſo wofully in this one thing, which ſeemes to be moſt within their Sphere: and if God have ſo ordered it, that although Mariners, Phyſitians, and Husbandmen, can by the preſent face and poſture of the skie, tell ſomewhat of winde and weather inſuing, but they are limited that they cannot do this fourteen dayes before; nor then when they do it, any farther then by a likely conjecture.

            </p>
            <p>Its the nobleneſſe of his make, that where he acts like himſelfe, acts as a man, he acts by <hi>wit and will:</hi> He is <hi>agens conſilio,</hi> ſuch an Agent as acts by <hi>Counſel;</hi> that is, by dictate and principle of Reaſon and will; and theſe two are lockt up from the powers of all creatures, that they cannot act on them immediatly; and ſo from the power of the Stars.

            <p>Theſe Aſtrologers make their neſts above the Stars, and <hi>Lord</hi> it over their weake diſciples, aſſuming more right over them then the Stars have; for many times they take away their <hi>reſt,</hi> and <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the quiet of their minde</hi> by their dayly expectation of ſuch ſucceſſes as <hi>they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly ſpeak of,</hi> and ſhall never come to paſſe.</p>

There be ſome things in all Arts that God hides from men, as Sympathys and Antipathies in natural Philoſophy, the returnes of Agues by ſet fits in Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal practice; and in your own way, the cauſe of the ebbings and flowings of the Sea: You are not infallible in what you think you know: you are apt enough to erre as you are men; <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt errare;</hi> but how much more apt if you proceed by <hi>erroneous principles</hi> and doctrines?</p>

            <p>Oh remember how unduely and nn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily you have perplexed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced the hearts of people: you have put them in feare where no feare was, and rejoyced them when you had no
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170142:162"/>
good ground for it. You have raiſed up hopes in them like ſpiders webbs, which a little time hath eaſily ſwept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and you have driven many to deſpaire, when God gave no cauſe for ſuch deſperation.</p>
            <p>How infectious have your principles and practices been? How many have been miſled by you? Think on your Schollers whom you have trained up to follow your ſteps; if you walke awry, how can they walke right? Doth it not, or may it not pitty your heart to ſee ſo many, young, ingenious, hopeful Gentlemen, to be corrupted by you? It may be God may give you repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which I heartily wiſh; but they may be hardned in their vanity, and never returne; and will not that fall ſad on you, when you ſhall remember that you have a generation in the pit beneath, whom your falſe teaching and corrupt example hath begotten?</p>
            <p>You cannot be ſo inobſervant in your own way, but you doe know that God from heaven doth beare witneſſe againſt your weather-wiſdome; making that prove faire that you foretel to be foul, and foule to be fair. Now if you are ſo much out in that which is loweſt in your way; may you not much more miſtake in higher pretences?</p>
            <p>Surely ſince you are ſo confident of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170142:163"/>
things to come, which yet God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath not actually determined, you might be more bold to call up things <hi>paſt;</hi> if you can tell a perſon what <hi>ſhall befal him,</hi> you may as well tell what <hi>hath befallen him.</hi> Why doe you not bend your thoughts that way, and not this? is it not becauſe it would not be ſo taking with men, and withal it would decry your skill?</p>
            <p>Remember, and forget not, you muſt give account of your wayes and workes; thinke ſeriouſly of it: Will your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings be owned by Chriſt another day? will he ſay to you, <hi>Euge bone ſerve, Well done thou good and faithful ſervant?</hi> thou haſt been faithful in thy Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, I will make thee Lord of ten Cities; <hi>enter into thy Maſters joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will he not rather accuſe you for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing your ſelves and others? for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending your parts and paines, and ſnarling at thoſe who reproved you? Your ſins are great, but not unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: Oh that God would give you repentance unto life, like thoſe we read of in <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 19. Many believed, and among thoſe, <hi>Many that uſed curious Arts, brought their Bookes together and burned them before all men.</hi> If you will ſtile your dealings Arts; others, and rightly too, will call them <hi>Curious:</hi>

            <p>I know they inſinuate not barely by pretending to augment your knowledge, but knowledge in relation to your practice; of ſomething to be done by you, and that hereafter; nay of what God will doe by you, and to you; and theſe conſiderations are taking and ſnaring.</p>
            <p>To pretend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to advance knowledge onely, without practice would be <hi>vaine ſpeculation:</hi> to know onely what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns other men, would ſeeme a <hi>buſibodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> to tell you what is paſt is but to recall what you had ſome knowledge of before; but to tell you what is to come, and to come from God, this takes much with you.</p>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170142:164"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Bona verba:</hi> Theſe are good words indeed; but looke well to it, leſt while you aime to be higher then other men, you fall not beneath the loweſt Chriſtians; and while you ſtrive to know what you ſhould not, you grow ignorant of what you ſhould.</p>
            <p>The knowledge of God and a mans ſelfe, are the greateſt Sciences, and they make faire to inſtruct you in both, but lead you aright in neither. The Word, the Goſpel, the Word of truth, will give you the knowledge of God and your ſelves, which they and the Stars can never do.</p>
            <p>Tis true, they maintaine their way in a kinde of majeſty with great, ſounding, ſtrange words: As the <hi>Luminary of the time, the Sun angular poſited in this or that houſe; the Moon in this or that Sextile, to Mercury Lord of his aſcendant,</hi> and ſuch like termes.
