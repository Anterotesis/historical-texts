            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WHEREAS the most Christian King, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of the many obliging promises he has made Us, of giving Us his Effectual Assistance for the recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Kingdoms, as soon as the condition of his Affairs would permit, has put us in a way of endeavouring it at this time; and in order to it, has lent Us so many of his Troops, as may be abundantly sufficient to unty the hands of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and make it safe for them to return to their Duty, and repair to Our Standard; and has notwithstanding for the present, according to Our desire, (unless there should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear further necessity for it) purposely declind sending over Forces so Numerous, as might raise any jealousie in the minds of Our good Subjects, of his intending to take the Work wholly out of their hands, or deprive any true <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> of the part he may hope to have in so Glorious an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is that of Restoring his Lawful King, and his Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Government; (all which Foreign Troops, as soon as we shall be fully setled in the quiet and peaceable Possession of our Kingdoms, We do hereby promise to send back, and in the mean time to keep them in such exact Order and Discipline, that none of Our Subjects shall receive the least Injury in their Persons or Possessions, by any Soldier or Officer whatsoever.) Tho an Affair of this nature speaks for it self, nor do We think Our selves at all obliged to say any thing more upon this occasion, than, That We come to Assert our Iust Rights, and to deliver our People from the oppression they lye under; yet when We consider how miserably many of Our Subjects were cheated into the late Revolution by the Art of ill men, and particularly by the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> Declaration, which was taken upon trust, and easily believed then, but since ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears notoriously false in all the parts of it, consisting no less
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50606:4"/>
of Assertions that have been evidently disproved, than of Promises that were never intended to be performed. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the like delusions for the time to come, and to do as much as lies in Our power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to open the eyes of all Our Subjects, We are willing to lay the whole matter before them in as plain and short a manner as is possible, that they may not again pretend mistakes, or have ignorance to plead for any false steps they shall hereafter make towards the ruin of their own, and their Countrey's Happiness.—</p>

                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>It begins with a thing very surprizing and memorable, That the <hi>French</hi> King hath once in his life made good his Word, and kept his <hi>Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> for so the late King <hi>Iames</hi> tells us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hath done with him, <hi>in pursuance of the many obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Promises he had made him, of giving him Effectual Assistance for the Recovery of his Kingdoms,</hi> &amp;c <hi>Effectual Assistance</hi> is a big word, and more than the <hi>Greatest</hi> and <hi>Most Puissant King</hi> is able always to make good. However I am glad to see they begin to endeavour to perform their Promises to one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is a good quality, and it is to be hoped they may in time extend it further. But this satisfies me, that the <hi>French King</hi> thinks it his <hi>Interest</hi> to restore the late <hi>King Iames;</hi> for he was never known to keep his Promise against his Interest; and it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what surprizing, that the <hi>French King,</hi> and <hi>English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> should have <hi>the same Interest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He seems sensible, that <hi>French Troops</hi> would not be very welcome in <hi>England;</hi> and therefore to qualifie this matter, he says, That the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>at his desire, has purposely declin'd sending over Forces so Numerous, as might raise any jealousie</hi> of a <hi>French</hi> Conquest; for that is the plain <hi>English</hi> of it; that they shall be kept under
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50606:5"/>
                     <hi>exact Discipline</hi> while they are here, and that he will send them home again, when <hi>he is fully setled in the quiet and peaceable Possession of his Kingdoms.</hi> But I thank God with all my heart, that there is no danger now of these <hi>French</hi> Troops coming into <hi>England;</hi> which is a much greater security to us, than both these <hi>Kings</hi> Promises for their Good behaviour here, or for their return home again: It is certain, that <hi>One</hi> of them could not keep his Word, if he would; and it is as certain, that the <hi>Other</hi> would not, as it is, that it would not be his Interest to do it; for there is not the same reason for the <hi>French</hi> King to keep his Promise of sending Troops into <hi>England,</hi> and to keep his Promise of sending no more than the late King <hi>Iames</hi> wants, or of calling them home again when he wants them no longer. But before I proceed to more particular <hi>Observations,</hi> it will not be amiss (and the conclusion of this <hi>Paragraph</hi> requires it) briefly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what is not in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> which the People of <hi>England</hi> had all the reason in the world to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in it.</p>
                  <p>Now I can find but <hi>very little</hi> in it, I might with great truth say, <hi>nothing,</hi> which a reasonable man who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the late <hi>Reign,</hi> especially the <hi>Conclusion</hi> of it, would have expected in such a <hi>Declaration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Design of such a <hi>Declaration</hi> be to give satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the minds of his Subjects, it ought at least to have contained as good Words, and fair Promises, as a Prince could give: He knew very well, what it was that had alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated his Subjects from him; that they apprehended their <hi>Laws,</hi> their <hi>Religion,</hi> and their <hi>Liberties,</hi> to be in great danger; and could not but know, that he had given them too just occasion for such Jealousies and Fears; and it is wonderful, that he should think of publishing a <hi>Declaration,</hi> and not think fit to give the least satisfaction
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50606:5"/>
about these matters; not to say one word about <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> nor to give any express promise, that he would remove these fears.</p>
                  <p>The only thing he appeals to, is the justice of his Cause; and does not think himself <hi>obliged to say any thing more upon this occasion, than that he comes to assert his own just Rights,</hi> &amp;c But this was not the Controversy between Him and his People; they did not dispute then his Right to the Crown, (tho they have some Reason to do it now) and yet were willing to part with him, when he thought fit to leave them; and if he knew what made them so, and hoped to return again by their Assistance, and with their good-liking, any one but those of his own Council would have thought him obliged to say something of it.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange's Declaration</hi> put him in mind of this, which he says <hi>cheated his Subjects into the late Revolution;</hi> and it had been much more to the purpose to have discovered the <hi>cheat</hi> of that <hi>Declaration,</hi> or to have said nothing of it, than to affirm without any proof, that now <hi>it appears to be notoriously false in all the parts of it;</hi> for <hi>English Protestants</hi> know nothing to this day, but that it is all true still. Were there not in the late <hi>Reign</hi> open and bold attempts made against the <hi>Laws,</hi> the <hi>Liberties,</hi> and the <hi>Religion</hi> of these <hi>Kingdoms?</hi> Was not the <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> set on foot for those purposes? Were not the <hi>Iudges</hi> tamper'd with, to obtain a sentence in favour of the <hi>Dispensing Power,</hi> and placed and displa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, till they could find fit Tools for that Work; men who would sacrifice the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> of their Countrey to the Will of their Prince, or to their own Covetousness and Ambition? Were not the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and the <hi>Test,</hi> Dispensed with upon this pretence, and men unqualified by Law, put into <hi>Ecclesiastical, Civil,</hi> and <hi>Military</hi> Preferments, to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50606:6"/>
apparent danger both of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State?</hi> Was there no <hi>Ecclesiastical Commission</hi> set up, no <hi>Popish Chappels, Monasterys</hi> and <hi>Convents</hi> erected and endowed contrary to <hi>Law?</hi> Were not the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> Closeted and Examined about the repeal of the <hi>Test,</hi> and those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced and turned out of all Offices and Employments, who would not comply? Were not the <hi>Bishops</hi> sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and Tried in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> for their Humble <hi>Petition</hi> to him against reading the <hi>Declaration?</hi> Was not the Administration of Justice, and the greatest Military Trusts put into the hands of <hi>Papists?</hi> Were not the <hi>Charters</hi> of <hi>Cities, Towns,</hi> and <hi>Corporations</hi> seized into the <hi>King</hi>'s hands, and so new-modelled, that the <hi>King</hi> might chuse what <hi>Burgesses</hi> he pleased, and have a <hi>House of Commons</hi> of his own Creatures? Were there not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible grounds of suspition concerning the Birth of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales?</hi> And has there been sufficient sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction given the Nation about it to this day? These are the Grievances complain'd of in the <hi>Prince's Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which were believed then, not upon the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> but because they were seen and felt; and are believed still, because they are still remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by those who saw and felt them; and how they have since <hi>been evidently disprov'd,</hi> I cannot guess. But if such things as these are not thought fit to be owned as mistakes in Government; if it was not thought fit to promise the redress of any one of them, no not in his <hi>Declaration,</hi> whereby he commands and invites his <hi>Subjects</hi> to Assist him in recovering his Kingdoms; I can easily guess, that they will not be thought faults, much less be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd if he should return: They must be his very <hi>Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subjects</hi> indeed, that can be thus imposed upon</p>

                  <p>And therefore, to take the matter from the beginning, it cannot be forgotten, That as soon as We had certain Notice of the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> unnatural design of Invading Our Kingdoms, with the whole Power of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> We first took the best care We could to provide for Our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; which We seem'd effectually to have done, when We had put Our Fleet and Army into such a condition, that tho his most Christian Majesty, who well saw the bottom of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign against Us, against Himself, and indeed, against the Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> offered Us considerable Succours both by Land and Sea; We did not think it at all necessary to accept them, at that time, as resolving to cast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Our selves wholly (next to the Divine Protection) upon the Courage and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of Our <hi>English</hi> Army, which had been with so much care and tenderness form'd and obliged by Us. And having thus prepared to oppose Force to Force; We did, in the next place, apply Our selves to give all reasonable satisfaction to the minds of Our good Subjects, by endeavouring to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and to let them see be times, and whilst the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief might easily have been prevented, how fatal a Ruin they must bring upon their Countrey; if they suffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be seduc'd by the vain pretences of the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> Invasion. However, so great was the infatuation of that time, that We were not believ'd till it was too late. But when he was oblig'd to throw off the Mask by degrees, and that it began to appear plainly that it was not the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Government (which yet was a matter that did not at all belong to him to meddle with) but the Subversion of it, that he aim'd at, that so he might build his own Ambitions designs upon the Ruins of the <hi>English</hi> Nation: And when the Poyson had insinuated it self into the vital Parts of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50606:7"/>
Kingdom; When it had spread over our whole Army, and so far got into Our Court and Family, as not only to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt some of Our Servants that were nearest Our Person, and had been most highly obliged by us, but not even to leave Our own Children at that time uninfected: When Our Army daily Deserted on the one hand, and on the other hand Tumults and Disorders increased in all Parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; And especially, when shortly after the Revolution came on so fast, that We found Our selves wholly in Our Enemies Power, being at first confin'd by them in our Own Palace, and afterwards rudely forced out of it under a Guard of Foreigners; We could not then but be admonished, by the Fate of some of Our Predecessors in the like circumstances, of the danger We were in, and that it was high time to provide for the security of Our Person (which was happily effected by Our getting from the Guard that was set upon us at <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and Our arrival in <hi>France,</hi> the only Part in <hi>Europe</hi> to which We could retire with safety) that so We might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Our selves for better times, and for a more happy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; such as is that, which, by the Blessing of God, is at present put into our Hands.</p>

                  <p>To begin with the <hi>Certain notice of the P. of</hi> Orange'<hi>s Design,</hi> is not <hi>to take the matter from the beginning.</hi> Had he intended to give any satisfaction to <hi>English</hi> Subjects, he should have begun, where their Complaints and Grievances, occasioned by his <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Illegal</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, began; that is, where the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Design, and his own <hi>Abdication</hi> began. That he <hi>took the best care he could for his own defence,</hi> no man questions; and had he taken less; it would not have been taken ill by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That his <hi>Christian Majesty</hi> saw <hi>this Design was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50606:7"/>
                     <hi>himself,</hi> long before the <hi>late King</hi> was sensible of it, appears from the <hi>Memorial</hi> printed at the <hi>Hague,</hi> 9. <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1688. by <hi>Monsieur de Conte d'Avaux,</hi> the <hi>French King's Ambassadour:</hi> But when he says 'twas <hi>against the Peace of</hi> Europe, I confess, I know not how to understand it, unless by <hi>the Peace of</hi> Europe, his <hi>Most Christian Majesty</hi> mean an <hi>Universal Desolation,</hi> which he was making as fast as he could. For this cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to be a most certain and effectual way of setling a <hi>Country</hi> in peace, to lay it waste, and to destroy, and drive out the Inhabitants. To prevent which indeed, was the bottom of this <hi>Design;</hi> and the most effectual way to do it, was to divide <hi>England</hi> from the Interest of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>French King,</hi> to prevent this, did offer <hi>King Iames</hi> the Assistance of his Forces, is very probable from the same <hi>Memorial,</hi> which threatens the <hi>Dutch</hi> with it; and how this Assistance came to be refused, we learn from my <hi>Lord Sunderland</hi>'s Letter, printed in <hi>the History of the Desertion,</hi> which, and some other Counsels (that thwarted the <hi>Popish</hi> Designs) cost him his <hi>Religion,</hi> and soon after the Favour of his <hi>Prince,</hi> and his Preferments at Court.</p>
                  <p>That he had no such great Confidence in <hi>the Fidelity of his English Army,</hi> was too evident in the daily Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he made in it; exchanging <hi>Protestants</hi> for <hi>Papists,</hi> and <hi>English</hi>-men for <hi>Irish;</hi> which occasioned that memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Accident at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> which gave such a general disgust to the Army, in a very lucky Season, as greatly disposed them either to go over to the <hi>Prince,</hi> or at least not to fight against him.</p>
                  <p>That he did many things in the time of his distress to sweeten his Subjects, is true; but he was much mistaken if he thought this sufficient to give <hi>reasonable satisfaction.</hi> He undid many things, which he had illegally done;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50606:8"/>
but he did this so late, and it was so apparently a matter of force, owing to the change of his fortune, not of his Inclinations, and then too, done with so ill a grace, that I could observe no body that was then satisfied with it.</p>
                  <p>He restored the <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and of other <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Corporations;</hi> He dissolved the <hi>Ecclesiastical Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> restored <hi>Magdalen Colledge,</hi> but never own'd the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legality of these Proceedings; would never renounce <hi>his dispensing Power;</hi> would never be persuaded by the most humble <hi>Petitions,</hi> and earnest Importunities of his <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> to call a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> and to refer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress of all Grievances to them; till he seems to have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Design of leaving <hi>England,</hi> and then his Issuing out of <hi>Writs,</hi> which he resolved should never be executed, could do him no hurt, and would have a good appearance, as if he had been willing to have referr'd all to a <hi>Parliament,</hi> had not the growing Power of his Enemies made it more necessary for him to consult the safety of his own Person.</p>
                  <p>The Case of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge convinced all men, that these were Extorted Favours, and would last no longer, than it was safe to recall them.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> had given his Orders to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> the <hi>Visitor</hi> of that <hi>Colledge,</hi> to recall Dr. <hi>Hough,</hi> and the former <hi>Fellows</hi> of that Society, and he accordingly went down to reinstate them; but upon the News that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet had suffered much in a Storm, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably could not sail till the next Spring, His Lordship had new Orders sent to call him back; but that News proving false, he was permitted to return, and to pursue his first Orders: This, it seems, was <hi>all the reasonable satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> that could be given, what his Graces and Favours to <hi>Protestants</hi> were, and how long they would last.</p>
                  <p>As for what concerns the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> now our Gracious <hi>King,</hi> I know of no <hi>mask</hi> he had on, nor that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50606:8"/>
ever <hi>he threw off,</hi> or that He afterwards appeared to be any other than his <hi>Declaration</hi> had represented Him. He came not for the <hi>Crown,</hi> but to <hi>reform Abuses,</hi> and <hi>to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Succession,</hi> which the Right of his <hi>Princess,</hi> and <hi>his own</hi> Right and Interest, the preservation of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion,</hi> and of the <hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> gave Him Right and Authority <hi>to meddle with;</hi> but besides his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and original Intention, he has the Crown which he came not for: He has deceived no body in it; but if any one be deceived, King <hi>Iames,</hi> and the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have deceived Him; the one in leaving his Crown, the other in placing it on his Head; where indeed it ought to be, both in Right of His <hi>Princess,</hi> and for his <hi>own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;</hi> for He who saves a Nation, had He no other Claim or Title, may very well deserve to wear the Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when it was with the free Consent of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,</hi> our most <hi>Gracious Queen,</hi> and upon the desire of the <hi>Estates of the Realm,</hi> and still necessary to save the <hi>Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place, He justifieth his leaving <hi>England,</hi> for <hi>the security of his</hi> Person, <hi>being wholly in the Enemies power, at first confined by them in his own Palace, and afterwards rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forced out of it under a Guard of Foreigners.</hi> But if he have forgot it, others have not, that before this happened, he had privately withdrawn his <hi>Person,</hi> disbanded his <hi>Army,</hi> dissolved his <hi>Government,</hi> flung his <hi>Broad Seal</hi> into the <hi>Thames,</hi> and had never had this pretence for his Escape, had he not been stopped by a mistake, for no body intended to stay him, and all this while he was in Treaty with the Prince, and that upon such equal Terms, that he could be under no just apprehension of ill usage.</p>
                  <p>He excuses his going to <hi>France,</hi> because it was <hi>the only part in</hi> Europe, <hi>to which he could retire with safety;</hi> which is a Confession that he alone was in the <hi>French</hi> Interest against all <hi>Europe</hi> besides; and that he durst not trust his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50606:9"/>
Cause with any other Princes in Christendom; which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues either a great jealousie of his own Cause, or of their Justice and Honour, even to distressed Princes. But I am sure <hi>France</hi> was the only place in <hi>Europe</hi> he ought to have avoided; and if he had no other place to go to, he ought to have ventured himself at home, or to have gone to <hi>Rome,</hi> which had been a kind of <hi>Second Home,</hi> unless he intended to resign his Crown. He knew what Opinion <hi>English</hi> Subjects had of <hi>His Most Christian Majesty,</hi> and might have known, that they would never fetch him from <hi>France</hi> again, nor willingly receive him with a <hi>French</hi> Power. What a <hi>happy Opportunity</hi> he now has to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Kingdoms again by <hi>French</hi> Troops, I suppose by this time he begins to discern; and I hope it may prove a very happy Opportunity for his <hi>Dear Ally</hi> to lose <hi>his:</hi> He has shewed him by his own example what to do in such cases; and the <hi>English Parliament</hi> has taught the <hi>French</hi> what name to give it.</p>

                  <p>Upon what foundation of Iustice, or Common Sense, the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> Faction in <hi>England,</hi> were pleased to treat this Escape of Ours out of the Hands of Our Enemies, in the stile of an <hi>Abdication;</hi> a word when apply'd to Sovereign Princes, that was never before used to signify any thing but a free and voluntary Resignation of a Crown, as in the Cases of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and the late Queen of <hi>Sweden;</hi> and what a strange Super structure they raised up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this weak Foundation, that a Company of Men illegally met together, who had not Power, even by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession at that time (for it was before they had voted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a Parliament) to charge the Interest of the meanest Subject; should yet take upon them to destroy the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution

of the Government, to make an Ancient Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Monarchy become Elective; and then assuming to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Right of Election, should proceed to settle the Succession in so odd and extravagant a manner, are Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions that need not be repeated: They are too well known to the World, to the great Reproach of the <hi>English</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the Grounds upon which they are Built, are too vain and frivolous to deserve a Consutation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Every Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of <hi>England</hi> is, in this Case, able to make his own Observations; and will, no doubt, examine a little better than hit her to he has done, what assurance any private Man can have of keeping his Estate, if the King himself shall hold his Crown by no better a litle.</p>

                  <p>His leaving the Kingdom for the safety of his Person, <hi>and to preserve himself for better times, and for a more happy Opportunity,</hi> he says, was no <hi>Abdication,</hi> as that signifies <hi>a voluntary resignation of his Crown;</hi> nor do I say it was: But his withdrawing his Person and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, was an actual quitting of the Government: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is in Law, I'm sure in common sense, the Throne is actually empty, when no body is in it; and no body is in it, when there is no Authority in the Nation to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the Government. And when the Throne is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the <hi>Estates of the Realm,</hi> (who are the only Supream Authority, when there is no Monarch) must fill it again, unless the Government must dissolve; and then there is an end of all <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Claims:</hi> And this they have done, not <hi>by turning an Ancient Hereditary Monarchy</hi> into an <hi>Elective,</hi> but by placing the next <hi>undoubted</hi> Heir on the Throne: And tho' he never intended to give up his Right and future Claim, yet he has done what he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50606:10"/>
intended to do: when the Throne is empty, it must be fill'd; and when it is declared vacant, and fill'd by the <hi>Supream Authority</hi> of the Nation, there is no room for him there.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Convention</hi> of <hi>Estates;</hi> When there was no <hi>King</hi> on the Throne, we do not pretend that they were a formal <hi>Parliament,</hi> for that must have a King at the Head of it; and therefore, as is observed in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> they could impose no legal Taxes on Subjects, nor did they attempt it; but yet they were not <hi>a company of men illegally met together,</hi> without Authority to do any thing; but they met at the request, and under the Protection of the <hi>then Prince of</hi> Orange, upon the Fundamental reasons of the <hi>Constitution</hi> it self, as the sole Judges of all Disputes relating to the Crown. Such Disputes will sometimes happen, and if there be no legal Judges of it, the Sword must decide it, and that is a State of <hi>War,</hi> not of <hi>Civil Government,</hi> which all Governments are supposed to provide against; and yet if the <hi>Convention</hi> of the <hi>Estates</hi> are not the proper Judges in such cases, it is certain there are none; and then the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is dissolved; we are in a State of War, and must submit to the <hi>longest Sword.</hi> But this is so fully and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Stated in the late ingenious <hi>Reflections on the Case of Allegiance to a King in Possession,</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 26. to <hi>p.</hi> 34. That to shorten this Letter as much as I can, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to that <hi>Author</hi> for further satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>So that <hi>Free-holders</hi> are not at all concern'd in this matter; a <hi>Convention</hi> of <hi>Estates</hi> without a King, cannot meddle with their Properties without a dissolution of the Government; But when there is no King, or it is a Question whether there be or not, or who is King by the Fundamental Constitution of the Government, the <hi>Convention</hi> of the <hi>Estates</hi> are the sole and proper Judges
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50606:10"/>
of it; in whose Determination, all private Subjects are bound in Conscience to acquiesce. And the <hi>late King</hi> need not complain of this, as if it made the Titles of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Their Crowns very uncertain and Arbitrary: For he had an unquestionable Title to his Crown, and might have held it to this Day, if he himself had not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd it, by breaking in upon the Laws, and even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Constitution it self; upon which his Right was founded: This occasion'd such a <hi>Revolution,</hi> as forced him to Abdicate, and to leave it to a <hi>Convention,</hi> to declare his Throne <hi>vacant,</hi> and to fill it.</p>

                  <p>I doubt his late Majesty is misinformed; for there are not only <hi>some,</hi> but a great many, who have more than <hi>one word</hi> to say, both for the <hi>Iustice,</hi> and the <hi>Necessity</hi> of these Proceedings, and the whole Nation already feels <hi>the extraordinary good effects of them,</hi> notwithstanding the expence of Blood and Treasure, of which he complains; for we know whom we are to thank for that. And the best way to prevent the effusion of more Blood, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of more Money, is to keep out his <hi>French Troops,</hi> and to know when we are well. Revolutions are and will be Bloody, and Chargeable, and therefore one <hi>Revolution</hi> is enough for one Age: The <hi>Dutch</hi> are already pay'd, and we don't desire to pay the <hi>French</hi> too; which is a much longer Account, and we shall get less by it.

                  <p>The next Consideration is, What may reasonable be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for the time to come: And as to that, no better judgment can be made of any future Events than by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon what is past: And doubtless from the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Temper and Complexion, the Methods and Maxims of the present Usurper, from the Steps he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken, when it was most necessary for him to give no distaste to the People, as well as from the Nature of all U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation, which can never be supported but by the same ways of Fraud and Violence by which it was first set up, there is all the Reason in the World to believe, that the beginning of this Tyranny, like the Five first Years of <hi>Nero,</hi> is like to prove the mildest part of it; and all they have yet suffer'd, is but the beginning of the Miseries which those very Men, who were the great Promoters of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, may yet live to see and feel, as the Effect of that Illegal and Tyrannical Government, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves first impos'd upon the Kingdoms.</p>

                  <p>There is no Answer needs be given to this, which may always be said of the best Beginnings of the best Government: We for our part find no fault with <hi>His Majesty</hi>'s Government yet, and see no reason to suspect it for the future: Taxes are the only Cause of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint now, and yet few complain of them but <hi>Iacobites,</hi> who out of their great Zeal for the late <hi>King,</hi> pay double Taxes to the present Government to keep him out, which does him more mischief than <hi>Iacobite</hi> Oaths could do; and yet thanks be to God, we have a hopeful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the end of these Taxes, and have been so well repaid of late, that we shall not grudge to clear the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50606:12"/>
that we may have something to call our own. But of all Men in the World (excepting always <hi>His most Christian Majesty</hi>) the <hi>late King</hi> should not attempt to frighten us with the Dangers of Misgovernment, for a good Reason in which himself is too nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and which <hi>all English Protestant Subjects</hi> very well know.

All Comparisons of Princes with <hi>Nero</hi> are very odious, but I know not how he could have made one more to the advantage of <hi>King William,</hi> than to compare his <hi>Reign</hi> hitherto with <hi>the five first Years of</hi> Nero, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Historians tells us may compare with that of the best of their Emperors. But however, this I am sure of, that it is better to begin a <hi>Reign</hi> as <hi>Nero</hi> did, than to begin where he ended, as <hi>two</hi> other <hi>Kings</hi> have done, and to go on to improve and perfect that ill <hi>Pattern;</hi> to which, if God had not mercifully prevented it, they were, not above a Month ago, just ready to have given their <hi>last hand,</hi> and the <hi>finishing strokes.</hi>

                  <p>And yet the Consideration must not rest here neither: For all wise Men ought, and all good Men will take care of their Posterity; and therefore it is to be remembred, that if it should please Almighty God, as one of his severest Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon these Kingdoms, for the many Rebellions and Perjuries they have been guilty of, so far to permit the Continuation of the present Usurpation, that we should not be restor'd during our Life-time, yet an indisputable Title to the Crown will survive in the Person of our dearest Son the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> our present Heir apparent, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50606:12"/>
his Issue, and, for default of that, in the Issue of such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sons as we have great reason to hope (the Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now with Child) we may yet leave behind us: And what the Consequences of that is like to be, may easily be understood by all that are not strangers to the long and bloody Contentions between the two Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster;</hi> and whoever shall read the Histories of those Times, and there shall have presented to him as in one view a Scene of all the Miseries of an Intestine War, the perpetual harrassing of the poor Commons by Plunder and Free-quarter, the ruine of many noble Families by frequent Executions and Attainders, the weakning of the whole Kingdom in general at home, and the losing those advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages they might in the mean time have procur'd for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves abroad, cannot but conclude that these are the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Effects of those Strugglings and Convulsions that must necessarily happen in every State, where there is a Dispute entail'd between an injured Right and an unjust Possession.</p>

                  <p>This will need but a very short Answer. For as to the Civil Wars he threatens our Posterity with from the Pretences of the <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> I must needs say, I had rather, if it must come to fighting, that they should fight for the Crown twenty or thirty Years hence, then now. <hi>Give Peace in our days,</hi> O <hi>Lord.</hi> I had rather our Posterity should enslave themselves, if they shall have a mind to be enslaved, then that we should enslave our selves and our Posterity with us. There is no such haste of bringing in <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> and it is to be hoped, if we be true to our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> our Posterity may grow wise by our Example. But I must observe, that whereas the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> in this <hi>English Declaration</hi> is called the <hi>Heir apparent,</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> Declaration
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50606:13"/>
he is called only the <hi>Presumptive Heir.</hi> Perhaps <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive Heir</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> Law may be the same with <hi>Heir apparent</hi> in <hi>ours:</hi> If it be not, What did Sir <hi>E. H.</hi> or whoever was the Penman of this <hi>Declaration,</hi> mean by it? Will they set aside the Pretences of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> if the <hi>late</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi> (who is said to be with Child) in good truth bring forth a Son? this looks very suspiciously, as if they did not believe, they had given sufficient Satisfaction, about the <hi>Birth</hi> of this Pretended <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales;</hi> but however we must <hi>presume</hi> him <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> till they have another whom they can by better proof make out to be the unquestionable Son of the <hi>late Queen Mary.</hi>

                  <p>There is another Consideration that ought to be of weight with all <hi>Christians;</hi> and that is the calamitous Condition of <hi>Europe,</hi> now almost universally engaged in a War among themselves at a time when there was the greatest hopes of Success against the <hi>Common Enemy,</hi> and the fairest Prospect of Enlarging the Bounds of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Empire, that ever was in any Age since the declining of the <hi>Roman:</hi> And so far from the hopes of a general Peace before our Restoration, that no rational Project of a Treaty can be form'd in order to it: But that once done, the thing will be easie, and we shall be ready to offer our Mediation, and interpose all the good Offices we can with <hi>his most Christian Majesty</hi> for the obtaining of it.</p>

                     <hi>Majesty?</hi> With whom are all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> at War but with Him? Who else has <hi>hindered the success a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Common Enemy, and the enlarging the bounds of the Christian Empire?</hi> Who invited the <hi>Turk</hi> into <hi>Europe?</hi> Who encourages him to continue the War, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so many Fatal Defeats, which may probably prove the ruin of his whole Empire? In a word, what other <hi>Christian Prince</hi> is the <hi>Great Turk</hi>'s Ally and Confederate in this War? And is not this War continued and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by all the Power and Interest of the <hi>French King,</hi> on purpose to disturb the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> that while the <hi>Imperial Forces</hi> are otherwise employ'd, he may make a Prey of his weaker Neighbours? It is decent to spare <hi>Crowned Heads,</hi> and such as have been crowned; but the <hi>Penman</hi> of this <hi>Declaration</hi> deserves his Reward for putting in so many notorious Falshoods, as may justly call the truth and sincerity of the whole in Question. I know but one Excuse for him, that he has made it almost all of a piece, and though he has had little regard to Truth, yet he has so ordered the matter, that he can deceive no body but those who have a great mind to be deceived; and it is not amiss that such should be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>Who but the late King could hope to perswade the World, that to restore him to his Kingdoms is absolutely necessary to the <hi>Peace of Europe,</hi> that <hi>before his Restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no rational Projects of a Treaty can be formed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a Peace.</hi> He may be mistaken in this, for the <hi>French</hi> King may quickly be glad to make Peace, and leave <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Restoration</hi> out of the <hi>Treaty:</hi> For things are come to that extremity now, that it is in vain to think of Peace, till <hi>Lewis the Great</hi> be reduced to such a state, as to accept it, and unable to break it: And then this Argument returns upon him; for the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50606:14"/>
a necessary Reason why he should not be restored, as I observed in my former <hi>Letter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But He, who could fancy himself to be a proper and effectual <hi>Mediator</hi> for a Peace, if he were restored, must have liberty to fancy any thing; and it is happy for him that he has so comfortable an Imagination: I do really pity him too much to endeavour to dispossess him of it; because that would be to <hi>undo</hi> Him more than He is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <hi>undone.</hi>

                  <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>Let us now consider the Grace and Favour promised in this <hi>Declaration.</hi> For <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Pardon,</hi> &amp;c. are very good things when we need them, but yet no Man would chuse to need them, if he could help it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the <hi>late King's Restoration</hi> were desirable upon other Accounts, and nothing hindred Subjects from returning to their Duty and Allegiance but fear of Punishment for what is past, the Promise of <hi>Pardon</hi> would be a very good Argument to encourage Subjects to assist him in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; but merely that we shall be pardoned, is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to bring him back, because we shall need no Pardon if we don't; and that is always the surest side, to need no Pardon, much surer than any Promise of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> the <hi>late King</hi> can make.</p>
                  <p>And yet he has used that great Caution in his Promise of Pardon, as if he were afraid we should expect more than he intends to give, and should charge him with a new breach of Promise, when we come to <hi>Tower-Hill</hi> or <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We see whom he has excepted, but 'tis not easie to know who is pardoned; the truth is, he has put all the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> under a necessity of forfeiting their Pardon, when he recovers his Throne, or of being hang'd or <hi>Mobb'd,</hi> at least of venturing both, before <hi>He</hi> can be in a condition to Pardon. All are excepted from this Pardon, who shall either <hi>appear in Arms against him, or do any Act or Thing in Opposition to his Restoration.</hi> Now, <hi>to collect or pay any of the Illegal Taxes, or any part of the Revenue of the Crown,</hi> are expresly forbid, <hi>as abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:50606:16"/>
                     <hi>or supporting the present Usurpation;</hi> and therefore to pay Taxes is one of the <hi>Acts or Things</hi> which excludes from Pardon, and this excepts the whole Nation at once. And for the comfort of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> to Pray for King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and for the success of their Arms, especially after the <hi>late King</hi> is landed, will certainly be <hi>doing an Act or Thing in Opposition to his Restoration.</hi> And all <hi>Magistrates</hi> are in a very hopeful Condition, who are excluded from Pardon, unless they <hi>shall immediately after Notice of his Landing, make some Publick Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of their Allegiance to Him, and of their Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to his Authority, and cause his Declaration to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd as soon as it shall come to their Hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a very <hi>Gracious Pardon,</hi> which Men must Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase at the Price of their Necks, and yet how far this <hi>Pardon</hi> will extend, we know not; it may be only to <hi>Life,</hi> for here is no mention of <hi>Fortunes</hi> or <hi>Honours:</hi> and yet it is but a meer <hi>Pardon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> here is not one kind word given to the <hi>Protestant Nobility, Gentry,</hi> or <hi>Clergy;</hi> no Promise to employ them in his <hi>Councils,</hi> or any <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Military</hi> Trusts; and when we know how he has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto kept his Promises, we have little reason to expect that he will now do more than he has promised.</p>
                  <p>But besides the <hi>Exceptions</hi> from Pardon in general words, which upon one Account or other do involve the whole Nation, there are some things very Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as to the <hi>Persons</hi> by <hi>Name</hi> Excepted. Most of them I believe are not sorry for it, because they know their case would have been the same, had they not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and possibly others may hope, their case may be the better for being excepted. But why Sir <hi>St. F.</hi> and Sir. <hi>S. Gr.</hi> They are both of them very worthy and honest Gentlemen, and I dare almost be their <hi>Compur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatour,</hi> as to having had any hand in <hi>Revolutions:</hi> But
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50606:16"/>
I must confess both of them have Estates very worthy to be excepted. And some such Reason probably there may be for excepting Sir <hi>I. O.</hi> and Sir <hi>B. D.</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> for it cannot but come into every body's mind, how conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently their Estates lye to make a Compensation to Sir <hi>E. H.</hi> for his great Merits and Sufferings. But why de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend so low as to except poor <hi>Hunt</hi> the Fisherman? This I take to be a true stroke of <hi>Secretary Melfort's Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Bigotry,</hi> and put in on purpose to let us know that effectual care will be taken, that the <hi>late King,</hi> whenever he returns, shall have so <hi>exact</hi> a Memory, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the meanest Man in <hi>England</hi> shall not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You see what the Pardon is, and those who like it may merit it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they please.</p>

                  <p>But when he says, <hi>We are convinc'd in our Iudgment that Liberty of Conscience is most agreeable to the Laws, and to the Spirit of the Christian Religion,</hi> me-thinks these <hi>two Kings</hi> treat one another with great Freedom. For what handsomer Complement could have been made to the <hi>most Christian King,</hi> then to intimate that his Persecution of his <hi>Protestant Subjects</hi> is not at all agreeable to the <hi>Laws,</hi> or to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Christian Religion?</hi> This is Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing if the <hi>French King</hi> can bear it: But, I suppose they are agreed, that <hi>K. I.</hi> shall <hi>declare</hi> as is most fit for his purpose; and the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>do</hi> what is most convenient for his own.</p>

                  <p>Lastly, It shall be our great Care by the Advice and Assistance of our Parliament, to repair the Breaches and heal the Wounds of the late Distractions, to restore Trade by putting the Act of Navigation in effectual Execution, which has been so much violated of late in favour of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to put our Navy and Stores into as good a Condition as we left them, to find the best ways of bringing back Wealth and Bullion to the Kingdom, which of late has been so much exhausted, and generally we shall delight to spend the Remainder of our Reign, (as we have always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd since our coming to the Crown) in studying to do every thing that may contribute to the Re-establishment of the Greatness of the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy upon its old and true Foundation the united Interest and Affection of the People.</p>

                  <p>What these <hi>Breaches and Wounds of the late Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are, he does not tell us, and therefore we must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they are such as are here mentioned. As for <hi>resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Trade,</hi> it has not been lost yet; the <hi>Custom house</hi> does not complain of it, which is commonly the first that feels it. The <hi>Navy</hi> is in a much better Condition than he left it, if we may guess at that by its late Exploits: But if he be so well skilled <hi>in restoring Navies,</hi> he ought both in Charity and Gratitude now to stay a little longer in <hi>France.</hi> As for his <hi>bringing back Wealth and Bullion into the Nation,</hi> I believe the Nation would have been better pleased, if he would have promised to send none out. And as for his <hi>Concluding</hi> promise in these words, <hi>And generally we shall delight to spend the Remainder of our Reign (as we have always design'd since our coming to the Crown) in studying to do every thing that may contribute to the Re-establishment of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>

                     <hi>of the English Monarchy upon its old and true Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, the united Interest and Affection of the People.</hi> This is <hi>Plain-dealing,</hi> and surest to be made good of any thing in the <hi>Declaration.</hi> And if he does this <hi>now, as he always designed to do it</hi> (for he could not then do all that he <hi>designed</hi> to do) here is a renewed Promise of <hi>popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power:</hi> And those are unpardonable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, who will not take his word for it.</p>

               <p>Thus having endeavored to answer all Objections, and give all the Satisfaction we can think of to all Parties and Degrees of Men: We cannot want our selves the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of having done all that can be done on our part whatever the Event shall be, the Disposal of which we commit with great Resignation and Dependance to that God who judges Right: And on the other side, if any of our Subjects after all this shall remain so obstinate as to appear in Arms against us, as they must needs fall unpitied under the Severity of our Iustice, after having refused such gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious offers of Mercy, so they must be answerable to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for all the Blood that shall be spilt, and all the Miseries and Confusions in which these Kingdoms may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be involved by their desperate and unreasonable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
