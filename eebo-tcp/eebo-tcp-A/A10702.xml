            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We call it a happy peace, &amp; we bleſſe the time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, when our Armes are ſet apart, when our Enſignes are fyrled vp, and when our Drummes and warlike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments do ſerue to fetch home May, or are hanged by the wals: but the warres of Weſtminſter Hall, are then in their greateſt fury, and the incounters there maintained and continued, not againſt an open foe to our country, not againſt a Traytor to the Prince, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a rebell, or a ſpoiler of the common wealth; but the neighbour againſt the neighbour, the friend againſt the friend, the brother againſt the brother, &amp; ſomtimes the father againſt the ſonne.</p>

            <p>I will not meddle with thoſe of the decayed order of Knighthood, amongſt whom there hath likewiſe fallen out ſome contentions, the vnworthy ſomtimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring with thoſe that bee worthy; for I doe make a difference in reputation between Knight and Knight, and I hope hereafter to ſhew a reaſon why.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues places and dignities that belong to others, who neither by birth, nor by diſcent can challenge the place or title of a Gentleman, vnles (perhaps) countenanced by ſome petty office, or otherwiſe haue raked together ſome yearely reuenue, more then all their anceſtors were euer able to leaue to their heires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto by vertuous induſtry, but gotten ſometimes by deceiuing the Prince, otherwhiles by preiudicing the common wealth, &amp; moſt times, by exacting &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing as many as they had to deale withal, but vnder theſe pretences, they would vſurpe to themſelus a kind of preheminence, to throng &amp; thruſt before thoſe that are their betters both by birth and qualitie: and this malipert ſawcines maketh them to be the more hateful to as many as know from whence they are deſcended.</p>
            <p>It is not the giuing or taking of places, that either gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth or taketh away vertue, nor euery man that is inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with an office, is not therefore by and by had in the better reputation, but if they be ſo deſirous of eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, they muſt indeuor by their own labor &amp; indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, to heape to themſelus ſo precious treaſure, when curteſie &amp; affability are known to bee the inſtruments, whereby the hearts of the people are won.</p>

And as this thruſting and ſtriuing for places, is a common ſicknes amongſt men, ſo the infection is farre more violent amongſt women, and hath preuailed ſo farre, as (I thinke) it be paſt cure, for not one amongſt them, being willing to giue place, but euery one ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring and ſtriuing to take place, they are ready to ſcratch for it, and to take their roomes perforce, &amp; will not let to render reaſons to maintaine their right; one makes her plea, my huſband is a Squire, and I will giue place to none but to my Lady; an other will ſay, my husband is a Doctor, and why ſhould not I go with the formoſt: one ſtands vpon her owne petigree, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riues her ſelfe from ſome ancient ſtocke or family, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vauntes of her husbands office, another of his wealth, another of her chains, iewels &amp; ſilken gowns, and of ſo many other vanities beſides, that if their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ſhould fal to dealing in thoſe quarrels ſet abroch by their wiues, they would neuer be determined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bloody noſes.</p>
            <p>But what women be thoſe that doe moſt generallie ſtand vpon thoſe termes, or that will ſooneſt preſſe to be thus forward, but thoſe that be of the baſeſt birth, or haue beene otherwiſe noted and detected of infamy?</p>
            <p>I doe not meddle with Ladies all this while, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe vpſtart women be ful of iniury, yet Ladies that are deſcended of gentle parentage, are full of curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, they are not vengible the one againſt the other, they are not proud, they are not ſlanderous, they are no tatlers, to carpe at thoſe thinges that belongs not vnto them; now Ladies in theſe daies (a great many of them) are none of theſe great vaunters, to brag of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull parents, of their fathers, of their grandfathers:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16373:6"/>
they would be much aſhamed in any proud humour, to go ſearch the Herauldes bookes for their aunceſtors Armes, or to ſeeke out from what ſtocke or lineage they are deſcended.</p>
            <p>But what do theſe men or women gaine, that doe ſtand ſo much of their tiptoes? that do take the matter ſo highly vpon them, and are ſo ready to perch before their betters? they doe but be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>piſſe their owne credits? they raiſe vp duſt to hurt their owne eyes, for it makes others to harken after them, what they were by birth, how they haue beene brought vp, what their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation hath been in times paſt: and there will be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition made, not onely of themſelues, but of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, firſt what they were, from whence they came, &amp; how they haue liued, for wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> takes no knowledge of our riches, but of our vertues, not of our offices, but of our honeſties, not of our dignities, but of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts; not of our proud and lofty lookes, but of our kinde and curteous behauiours, but howſoeuer it bee befitting vnto men, O what an ornament it is to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be of a mild and modeſt diſpoſition?</p>
            <p>And yet I cannot commend this counterfeit ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in her that will ſit and ſimper, and ſpend a whole diner-time, in ſpeaches, ſtrained and deliuered like ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that will bee drawing out of a welcome, whilſt a man would haue eaten his dinner: no, I rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend her that hath a little verball quicknes, a nimble ſpirited wench that can laugh when ſhe liſt, weepe when ſhe liſt, chide when ſhe liſt, that can be ſick when ſhe liſt, and well againe when it pleaſe her ſelfe, that when ſhe is vp and ready in a morning, her day-worke is done, that is fit for all companies, that hath a ſweete

            <p>O what a pretious ſight it were to ſee a woman that were but young in yeares to bee ſober and modeſt, glory and admiration attends her in all her actions? &amp; it were good in her that were olde likewiſe, becauſe in an old woman, the contrary were abhominable, b ut where ſhould wee finde ſuch a woman ready made, vnleſſe we ſhould beſpeake her of purpoſe, and then we ſhould pay more for the faſhion, then the whole frame would be worth.</p>
            <p>If a man ſhould but ſtraine his penne a litle to write in the generall praiſe of women, and ſhould paint them forth with ſo many perfections as nature doth not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually beſtow in theſe our dayes, as many women as did but vnderſtand of this deſcription would wonder and be inquiſitiue what women they ſhould be that were ſo magnified, and if they did not reward the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a mocke, his beſt recompence ſhould bee, to be thought a meere diſſembler: but hee that ſhoulde but blaze the abuſe of any one particular woman, and ſhould write in an obſcure manner, not naming what one it were that he had thus diſplayed, euery woman that did but heare it, would take it to her ſelfe, and ſhee would not be perſwaded, but that it was ſo ment.</p>
            <p>The pretious iewels that were wont to garniſh thoſe women, that were moſt honourably eſteemed of, were the excellent ornaments of modeſty, of ſobrietie, of baſhfulnes, of ſilence, of chaſtitie, and ſuch other, but now thoſe are beſt eſteemed, that are moſt impudent,

that are moſt audacious, that are moſt ſhameles, that are moſt vnciuill; and what ſhall I ſay, that are many wayes more maſculine then men.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange again to ſee ſome women that do ſtand vpon their wiſedome, that do ſtand vpon their honor, that do ſtand vpon their honeſty; and yet will ſeem to vphold and maintain thoſe women that are immodeſt in their manners, laſciuious in their life, filthy in their communication, odious and hatefull in all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours, that haue beene noted of incontinencie, and well knowne to be infamous: and yet thoſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that a man would thinke they were made all of vertue, (&amp; without doubt, ſome of them no leſſe good then they ſeeme) they will notwithſtanding hold them company, take them vp into their Coaches: nay, they will imitate them, ſometimes in their gariſh and light attire, that are many times more Curtiſan-like, then eyther modeſt or comely: ſometimes againe in their impudent boldnes of behauiour, that were more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for my Lady <hi>Greene-ſleeues,</hi> then decent for thoſe women, that are of any good ſort or reputation. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Romains, it was accounted a great reproch and infamy, for a woman to bee prayſed by any man, eyther for her beauty, or for her feature, or for any quality that was not coreſpondent to vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidides</hi> accounteth thoſe women to bee moſt honeſt, that were leaſt ſpoken of eyther in prayſe or diſprayſe.</p>

            <p>I might take occaſion here to ſpeake of Faſhions, it was wont to be a diſeaſe amongſt Horſe, but now it is become a generall ſicknes amongſt men and women; and yet I thinke Faſhions be good for ſomewhat, for of my conſcience it driueth a great number to Church, that goeth more to ſhew their own pride, and to learn the new Faſhions that are broughtin by others, then to mend their owne manners, or to leuell their liues as they are taught by the Preacher.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diogenes</hi> laughed them to ſcorne, that by interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſought helpe from the Gods, and yet continued in a diſſolute and in a laſciuious manner of life: and me thinkes it ſtands with reaſon, that graue ſhowes and light attires can neuer hang well together.</p>
            <p>When the Cretans were vnnaturally intreated by the Romaines, they did not pray vnto the Gods to plague them with peſtilence, with warre, with famine, and ſuch like, but that they would ſend amongſt them new Faſhions, new inuentions, &amp; new fangled follies, which they knew to be a greater plague and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then any other that might befall them: And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacharſis</hi> was put to death for ſeeking to plant ſtrange faſhions which he had learned in his trauell.</p>
            <p>For thoſe women that be good &amp; godly (as I know there bee a great many) they will neuer bee diſpleaſed though I blaze the abuſes of the ill; for thoſe other that be bad, if they be angry I care not, and for her that hath a guilty conſcience, if ſhe find her ſelfe to be toucht, let her beginne to chide firſt in Gods name.</p>

            <p>Now if there be a woman that is ſicke of the ſpleen, and a little to eaſe her ſtomacke, will needs pronounce her ſelfe guilty before ſhe bee accuſde, I am furniſhed (you ſee) with preſidents inough to teach me to bee patient, &amp; to beare all reproaches that may be imputed againſt me, by the moſt bittereſt and ſpitefulleſt tongs.</p>

            <p>I remember, I was about to ſpeake of a many of wranglers that were ſtriuing for places, and diſputing

for dignities, but fearing I might bee accuſed of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge to ſteale out of the Goſpell, I might remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber here where it is written; <hi>VVhen thou art bidden to a Feaſt, ſit thee downe in the loweſt roome, that when the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the houſe commeth in, he may ſay, Friend, ſit vp high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſo it ſhall be for thine honour,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is a great vertue in a man, to be an vpright Iudge of himſelfe, for as it is the firſt Chapter of Fooles, for a man to thinke himſelfe to be wiſe; ſo it is a ſigne of as little wit, to thinke better of our ſelues then there is cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bucephalus, Alexanders</hi> horſe, in an ordinary ſaddle, would eaſily admit any man to ride him, but being appointed in his royall furniture, would ſuffer none but <hi>Alexander</hi> to mount him: ſo there be ſome that in a meane eſtate (ſuch as their fathers held before them) haue beene known to be lowly &amp; tractable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, but being after crept into an office, or a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced, whereby they might proule for pence, they know not how to behaue themſelues, but doe thinke that pride, diſdaine, &amp; curriſh demeanour, are the only complements belonging to Gentility. And this is it that armeth them with this ſawcines (I mean) to take place of their betters whereby they become iniurious, and in time might grow to a matter of quarrell, when amongſt perſons of reputation, honour is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore life; &amp; euery iniurious action not repulſed, is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the opinion of all magnificent minds to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable, infamous and reprochfull.</p>
            <p>It ſhould not be amiſſe therfore, but rather behoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that we might be informed what iniury is, wherby we may with the more facility, both moderate our

ſelues, and learne to repreſſe it.</p>
            <p>I doe not goe about to incite men to vnaduiſed or needles quarrels, but to informe the true meane how to ſhunne offences, or being offended, how to repreſſe an iniury, with a due reſpect, both of honour and a chriſtian conſideration: Iniuries are aſwell offered by wordes as by deedes; in wordes, by vnſeemely ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as in giuing the lie, or ſuch other like; in deedes, no leſſe by depriuing men of their reputation &amp; right, as in deprauing them of their due by any other meane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> I might ſpeake of infinite wrongs to be offered in both theſe kindes, that might draw to blowes: but I will let them paſſe, for I hold it no leſſe expedient for wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to know when it is time to put vp, as when it is time to draw their weapons.</p>
            <p>Vertue alloweth a iuſt Reuenge, and admitteth the defence of property and right: yet true it is, that the law of God willeth vs to be of that perfect patience, as not onely to endure iniurious wordes, but alſo quietly to diſgeſt and putvp all other wrongs that are offered, what, or howſoeuer: but very few men haue attained to that perfection in ſuffering wrongs and iniuries, as the Law of God requireth: there is nothing more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable to fleſh and bloud, then to endure wrong; let Diuinity and Philoſophy too, perſwade what they liſt, for impatient cruelty, making hot ſpurde youth his Agent, doth thinke no man capable of glory, that is not apt and ready to reuenge.</p>
            <p>And here <hi>Cicero,</hi> to aggrauate the matter, tels mee, <hi>That it is as great iniuſtice to put vppe an iniury, as to doe awrong:</hi> But if it be iniuſtice to put vppe an iniurie, why then it is a vertue to Reuenge, but
<pb facs="tcp:16373:10"/>
Reuenge proceedes of Anger, for Anger is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Reuenge, and what affinity may be betweene angry Reuenge, and doing of Iuſtice, I thinke is as much as is betweene doing of right, and doing of wrong, and ſo by conſequence as is between vertue and vice.</p>
            <p>I know not how to reconcile theſe matters together, but for him that is iniured I thinke the ſureſt way is to reuenge himſelfe by patience, for hee that is armed with patience, to endure and ſuffer wrong, puniſheth more in not puniſhing, then the haſtieſt Executioner that is moſt ſpeedy in reuenge.</p>
            <p>Perhaps (now on the other ſide) it may ſeeme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the courage of man, to relent when they haue done a wrong, but rather to perſiſt, and to vphold one wrong with another, the leſſe with the greater: if wee could then but examine the matter with a chriſtian conſideration, it would appeare that he that doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt to doe euill, doth ſtill endeuour to condemne himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Who will impute him to be worthy of infamy, that is cowardly ſtricken by another, or that is oppreſſed by aduantage by any manner of meane? nay, who will not rather condemne him that offereth ſuch an iniury and acquit him to whome it was done?</p>
            <p>And who will not laugh to ſee the ſawcines of ſome little worthy perſons, in whome there is neither ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, deſert, nor any other merite of worth, but a little audatious boldnes, and yet will pearch and preſume to take that place that is an other mans right?</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore I ſay, that infamy is due to him, that willingly doth a diſhonourable wrong; but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16373:10"/>
no reproch at all to him that taketh it.</p>
            <p>But to the end that men might know their owne places, both what they ought to take, and how they ought to giue, it ſhall not be amiſſe to diſtinguiſh of Gentry, and to ſhew the difference between Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen; from whence, and how it growes.</p>
            <p>I ſay there is a diſequality in Gentry, for vertue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it were) the firſt ſteppe to Generoſity, hee that can bur vaunt of the Scutchions left vnto him by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, ſeemeth himſelfe to bee very deſtitute, for the more high he fetcheth his petigrie, the leſſe reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he meriteth himſelfe, if hee cannot continue that honour, left vnto him by his Anceſtors.</p>

            <p>Faith is a rich treaſure, yet without works it is dead; ſo Nobility is honorable, but without vertu it is baſe. <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were brethren deſcended from one wombe, yet the one was noble by vertue, the other ignoble by vice: ſo <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> were both ſonnes to the Romaine Emperour <hi>veſpatian,</hi> but <hi>Titus</hi> was called by the Senate, <hi>The delight of the world,</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> through his execrable tyranies was named, <hi>The monster of humaine kinde.</hi> Nobility without ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is like a Knighthood without deſert: and as there hath beene many noble Families, excelling in vertue, &amp; quality of wit, ſo there hath beene Cities of hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable account, namely, that of Athens, worthily famed &amp; renowned, where there were bred many wiſe ſages an d valiant Captaines, which through their counſell and wiſedome did rule and preſerue the weale pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, by whoſe puiſance the enemy was repelled, by whoſe vnconquerable courage &amp; vertue, their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were inlarged.</p>
            <p>I might likewiſe ſpeake of mighty Rome, that was ſometimes miſtris of the world, it was then accounted a great glory to be reputed a Romaine: but as (by the opinion of her owne writers) ſhee had her originall from a baſe and a baſtardly generation, I meane, from the fugitiue Troians that eſcaped the burning towne, and ſlaughtered heapes of their betraied Countrimen:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16373:12"/>
but her glory hath beene ſithens obſcured, and (as it were) ouerſhadowed with darknes: but I wonder that our Engliſh Nation, for the glory of antiquity ſhoulde bee ſo fond to recount their Genealogy fro m ſuch a deſteyned progeny: a fugitiue people, a crauen gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, hunted and ferrited, from place to place, from country to country, from region to region: their City of Troy it ſelfe three times ſackt, yet to proue our diſcents from thence, we do mingle our matters with ſo many fained inuentions, as it might ſeeme ſtrange vnto wiſemen, but more abſurd to enterlace the vain fantaſies of Poets with matters of truth; and that it might the better appeare, I will ſet downe the ſtory in as briefe and ſhort manner as I can.</p>

               <hi>Leomedon</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Dardanus,</hi> the feyned ſonne of Ioue, a falſe periured Prince, for whoſe offence (as their owne hyſtories makes mention): Troy was firſt ouerflowne by the raging of the ſea, after that viſited againe with a moſt deadly plague; which could not be appeaſed but by the monthly gift of a Virgin, to a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſter, as they fell out by lot, till in continuance of time, it lighted on <hi>Heſione</hi> the daughter of <hi>Leomedon,</hi> who was reſcued &amp; freed by <hi>Hercules</hi> vpon conditions formerly vowed, proteſted and plighted by oath to be performed by <hi>Leomedon</hi> to <hi>Hercules:</hi> but <hi>Heſione</hi> being deliuered, the ſea-monſter ſlaine, and the City freede from all incombrances by <hi>Hercules: Leomedon</hi> now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine falſifying his promiſe, <hi>Hercules</hi> to reu enge the diſloyalty of that twice periured prince, firſt ſacked the City of Troy, where <hi>Leomedon</hi> ſauing himſelfe by flight, <hi>Hercules</hi> carried away with him priſoners, <hi>Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>Heſione,</hi> the children of <hi>Leomedon,</hi> who after

               <hi>Hercules</hi> being departed, returned againe, and hauing reedifyed and new builded the city, was a ſecond time aſſaulted by <hi>Hercules,</hi> who hauing ſlaine <hi>Leomedon,</hi> and now againe taken the City; <hi>Hercules</hi> that was mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent in all his enterpriſes, enlarged <hi>Priamus,</hi> and eſtabliſhed him in Troy to ſucceede his father; who yet againe erected and builded that infortunate City which flouriſhed in pompe and pride till his ſonne <hi>Paris,</hi> (who nothing digreſſing from his vnfaithfull progenitors) in a treacherous manner ſtole away <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena</hi> the wife of <hi>Menelaus,</hi> king of Lacedemon, who had both honorably feaſted, banqueted and entertained both him and his company: in reuenge of which fact, the angry Greekes ariuing before Troy with a mighty Army, after ten years ſiege, and a great ſlaughter of Princes, with other valiant men, by the treaſon of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi> together with the conſent of his father <hi>Anchiſes, &amp; Antenor</hi> his confederate; the City of Troy was taken, miſerably burnt and defaced, the country ruined and waſted, the aged king <hi>Priamus</hi> miſerably ſlaine, and the whole Troian eſtate vtterly ouerthrowne: thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Dictis Cretenſis,</hi> that ſerued with the Greekes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Troians during that ten yeares warres, who maketh a large deſcription of the diſloyalty of the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians, &amp; (in mine opinion) not without iuſt cauſe; for although <hi>Virgil</hi> in his <hi>Aenidos</hi> doth write more fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably in their behalfe, it is to be conſidered that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines deriuing themſelues from the Troians, <hi>Virgil</hi> himſelfe being a Romaine, doth therefore labour ſo much as in him lies to colour out the vnfaithfullnes of the Troyans, and would likewiſe deriue the Troian Princes from the line of the Pagan <hi>Gods,</hi> which they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16373:13"/>
themſelues had deified; but if <hi>Dardanus</hi> were the ſonne of Ioue (as their writers doe report) his Sonne <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon</hi> that proued periured, faithles and vntruſty, did farre digreſſe from any ſacred diſpoſition: ſo did <hi>Paris,</hi> that was <hi>Priams</hi> ſonne, who ſhewed himſelfe rather to proceede from the iſſue of a diuell, then from the line of a God, as it appeared in his behauiour, both to <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none;</hi> who before had ſaued his life, and againe with <hi>Menelaus,</hi> that in ſuch a princely ſort had entertained him.</p>
            <p>And what ſhall I ſay of our great Grandſire <hi>Aeneas,</hi> from whome the Romaines would ſo faine deriue themſelues? and from whome (as ſome of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh writers would perſwade) our Britiſh nation did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend? let vs ſee what <hi>Virgil</hi> himſelfe doth teſtifie of him, whoſe penne is ſtained in the fineſt manner, to blazon forth the glory of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> yet doth hee not deſcribe him to bee the ſonne of a common ſtrumpet begotten by old <hi>Anchiſes</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> whom the Romaines haue die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied together with their great Goddes <hi>Flora,</hi> another bird of the ſame wing: but <hi>Aeneas,</hi> after he had betrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his countey, he himſelf with the reſt of his treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious companions, were forced to wander at the ſea, robbing and ſpoyling, attending what Deſtiny would beſtow of him, landed in the end vpon the coaſt of Africa, at new built Carthage, where he likewiſe falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his faith, and betrayed <hi>Dido,</hi> and ſo leauing Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, in the end arriued in Italy, where, by menacing threates mingled with faire promiſes, together with corruptions &amp; gifts, he made ſuch diſcord &amp; diſſention in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, by means wherof ſuch horible ſlaughters of the people wer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, that diſpoſſeſſing the quiet

            </p>
            <p>A ridiculous tale, and for matter and circumſtance, fitter to furniſh the <hi>Legenda Aurea,</hi> then to be inſerted for matter of truth in a Chronicle hiſtory, and it may well become the Romaines to bragge of their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor <hi>Aeneas;</hi> but for vs that be Engliſh (me thinks) there ſhould be ſmall pride to depend of that antique generoſity, that is ſo baſely deſcended: and againe, comparing of hiſtories, there is no poſſibility, how the tales can hang together: for the fictions of Poets, they are no groundes for Hiſtorians to build vppon, and therefore to returne againe to our firſt purpoſe, I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16373:14"/>
ſay, there are degrees of gentrie, aſwel as of dignities &amp; honors, and that one is ſo much more a Gentleman by birth then another, by how much his Gentry is more ancient, more renowned, more manifeſt, and more mighty, which may bee ſaid, not onely in reſpect of birth, but likewiſe in reſpect of vertue.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen bee of three kindes, the firſt in reſpect of bloud, for ſo the vulgar ſort vnderſtands it; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, in reſpect of vertue, for ſo the philoſopher doth teach it: the third, in reſpect of both, and that (ſay I) is true Gentrie indeed.</p>
            <p>Gentrie by bloud belongeth but to the body; but gentrie by good conditions, hath relation to the mind: but when a man is gentill both by birth &amp; vertue, I ſee not what may bee added vnto him: yet ſome would haue a third ſupply of riches &amp; wealth, but riches can adde no degree to a Gentleman, and hee that woulde draw gentrie from wealth, is iniurious to the graces that are giuen vs from the heauens.</p>
            <p>But wealth is a ready inſtrument to put in practiſe certaine vertues belonging to gentrie, namely, bounty, and liberality: otherwiſe riches are rather a diſgrace then a grace to a Gentleman, that doth not beſtow them bountifully, as is befitting his eſtate.</p>
            <p>Yet thoſe that be of the ſcraping humour, wil ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pilfer a Text out of the holy Scripture, which, wreſting into a wrong ſenſe, they will alledge for themſelues, that their greedy heaping and gathering together, is but a chriſtianlike care, that euery man ſhould haue to prouide for his family.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſcraping excuſes are fitter for Churles then
<pb facs="tcp:16373:15"/>
for Gentlemen, (and yet me thinkes) <hi>Simonydes</hi> ſhifted himſelfe pretily, who being demanded, why he began to grow ſo miſerable in his latter yeares, to fall a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp of riches, when he was ready for the graue; to acquit himſelfe from a couetous diſpoſition, aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe (ſaid he) I had rather haue goodes to leaue to mine enemies when I am dead, then to ſtand in need of my friendes, whilſt I am aliue.</p>
            <p>I cannot forget to giue <hi>Dioniſius</hi> his due commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, who being aduertiſed of one that abounded in wealth, and yet liued a ſparing and a miſerable life, he commanded the party vpon paine of death, to bring in his riches, and to reſigneall that euer hee had to bee diſpoſed at his pleaſure: the party that durſt not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contradict what the King had commaunded; made ſemblance to deliuer all that euer hee had, but ſecretly reſeruing a ſmall portion to himſelfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with departing into a remote place, hee after liued with that little pittance, (which he had concealed in a more bountifull manner, then euer he had done before when hee was poſſeſſed of his greateſt aboundance; which being certified to <hi>Dioniſius,</hi> hee ſent yet once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for him, and giuing him all which before he had taken from him, he ſaid; now thou knoweſt how to vſe riches, take what is thine owne, for now thou well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueſt them.</p>
            <p>I might conclude, that if the enioying of wealth &amp; riches, be matter ſufficient, to make a man to be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilized, it were then a vilde thing to bee a Gentleman, becauſe they are ſeldome attained vnto, but by oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, extortion, deceit, fraud, &amp; ſuch other corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:16373:15"/>
there are compriſed vnder the title of Gentry, all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical perſons profeſſing religion, all Martial men that haue borne office, and haue had commaund in the field; all Students of Artes and Sciences, and by our Engliſh cuſtome, all Innes of Court men, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Law: It'skilles not what their Fathers were, whether Farmers, Shoomakers, Taylers or Tinkers, if their names be inrolled in any Inne of Court, they are all Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>The profeſſion of Armes being honourable, euery ordinary Souldier that hath ſerued ſeauen years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproch, ought to be accounted a Gentleman, and by the lawes of Armes may challenge the combat of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gentleman, in defence of his reputation.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman hauing aſpired to any title or dignity in the field, and in reſpect of age, or of any other infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is retired to his owne houſe, or to any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting place, ought neuertheleſſe to enioy that title and reputation, which he had formerly gained.</p>
            <p>Amongſt Students, there be many, that to attain wiſedome and knowledge, haue betaken themſelues to continuall ſtudy, and haue thereby attained to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vertues, and for profound knowledge in many matters, be had in admiration: but that kind of vertue that extendeth it ſelfe to the common profit of al men, that is altogether occupied about the maintenance of the common wealth, hath his firſt preferment, but thoſe that doe but imploy the benefite of their ſtudies to ſome particular purpoſe, or to their own priuate gain, muſt giue place to the former. The true martialing of ſoueraigne honour, to place euery one in his right de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and to giue him his due; the Diuine is firſt to haue
<pb facs="tcp:16373:16"/>
preferment, for the Miniſter of the word of God ought to haue the chiefeſt and moſt honourable place, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they be ſuch as they ought to be, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Timothie: They deſerue to haue double honour</hi> (faith he) <hi>where they reade or preach the Goſpell, &amp; where their works and manner of liuing are conformable &amp; agreeing to their doctrine.</hi> And as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith; <hi>Great is the dignity of Prelates, but greater is their fall if they be wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this honour thus rendered vnto them, they can not challenge as their proper right or due apertaining to themſelues, for that Prelate that is ambitious of worldly honour and eſtimation, doth rather ſmell of the Spirite of Antichriſt, then ſhew himſelfe to bee a follower to our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe preſcriptions are humility: for hee that exalteth him ſelfe, or deſireth to bee great amongſt you, let him be brought low (ſayeth our Sauiour) let him bee your ſeruant.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſt, that in <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> he repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the ambition of the Sonnes of <hi>Zebedie,</hi> who ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly deſired the one to ſit on his right hand, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on his left; and as Chriſt elſewhere condemneth the ambitious affections of ſuch as ambitiouſly deſire to exalt themſelues, and to ſeeke ſuperiority: ſo doth he in like ſort condemne all other, what or who ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that are ſo puft vp with pride and arrogancy, that they diſdaine to giue place and reuerence to thoſe that haue iuriſdiction and magiſtracy in the Church of God: and there is no leſſe pride and contempt in thoſe that will refuſe to giue honour and reuerence to him that is in authority to beare office and rule in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16373:16"/>
miniſtery, then there is in him on the other ſide, that doth ambitiouſly deſire to rule, but not to profite the Church; the which, ſo farre as my little skill will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde me, may moſt aptly bee applyed to the Pope &amp; his ſhauelings.</p>
            <p>But he that hath any ſpirituall charge, or hath the cure of ſoules in the Church of God, I ſay with Saint <hi>Paul, He is worthy of double honour,</hi> and he that diligently preacheth the Goſpel and conformeth his life accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his doctrine (I ſay ſtill) wee cannot reuerence him enough, nor render him too much honor.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour himſelfe would in no wiſe take vpon him to iudge betweene the brethren that came vnto him about the diuiſion of their land; neither is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny example in all the New Teſtament, where any of the Apoſtles (after their calling) intermedled wich matters appertaining to temporall Magiſtracy, but applyed their whole endeauors to the preaching of the Goſpell; the auncient Romaines had that obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, for they would in no wiſe admit that their <hi>Flamius,</hi> nor any other of their ſacrificing Prieſts, ſhold beare any rule or gouernement in the common wealth, but that they ſhould onely exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the ſeruice of their Gods: but this prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not done in any diſgrace, whereby to abate or diminiſh the leaſt iot of their honor or eſtimation, for king <hi>Dridanias</hi> cenſuring of profeſſions, which might bee moſt worthie, gaue the higheſt degree of honour to the Prieſts, that did dayly offer ſacrifice in the temples of their Gods.</p>
            <p>If the Heathen did thus much exalt and dignifie the reputation of theſe prophane Prieſts that were but
<pb facs="tcp:16373:17"/>
dedicated to the ſeruice of Idols, and Pagan Gods, what eſtimation, what reuerence, what honour may wee render to thoſe that are the Ambaſſadors of the Almighty God? that are ſent vnto vs with the glad and ioyfull tidings of our ſaluation? that are our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to begetvs to Ieſus Chriſt, by the preaching of his Goſpell? that are his Stewardes to diſpence his holy myſteries amongſt vs: to whome wee are not onely to attribute honour, but for whome wee are alſo bound to pray: if they doe not make themſelues vnworthy of it by their owne contempt, by their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes, by their pride, and by their ambition, as there bee ſome that haue ſet themſelues oppoſite to the ordinance of the Church, that haue ſet the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at a iarre, that will many times make the gloſe to ouerthrow the Text, that will cry out for Diſcipline, yet will obey no Diſcipline, that will take vpon them to teach al men, yet they themſelues wil not be taught, that are angry againſt Biſhoppes, and would not haue them to be Lordes, yet are become ſo Lady like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they would haue euery one a new faſhion particular to himſelfe: theſe are to proud in their own conceites, theſe be they that diſdaining to yeelde to authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do ſhew greater pride in their contempt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other can ſhew in their moſt ambitious deſires.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Timothie: Hee that deſireth the office of a Biſhoppe, that man deſireth a good worke:</hi> I hope the office of a Biſhoppe is not altogether without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and that authority in the Church of God, is not altogether vnworthy of honour: and where Chriſt prohibited his Diſciples, that they ſhould not be caled <hi>Rabbi,</hi> that they ſhould not be called Doctors,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16373:17"/>
&amp;c. by the opinion of the moſt learned writers, thoſe words of Chriſt doe not condemne ſuperiority, lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or any other like authority, but the ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire onely; neither doth he ſay elſewhere, that no man ſhould be great, or beare rule amongſt them: but his words are; <hi>He that deſireth to be great amongst you, let him be humbled,</hi> And <hi>Timothie</hi> notwithſtanding thoſe words ſpoken by Chriſt, calleth himſelfe the Doctor of the Gentiles; and <hi>Paul</hi> in like manner writing to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, calleth himſelfe their Father.</p>
            <p>Now as the holy Scriptures exhorteth the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Goſpell to be humble &amp; meeke, ſo we ought to render them the firſt title of honour, and to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> precedence in the formoſt ranke, eſpecially to thoſe that do not ambitiouſly deſire it. Loe, heare now the difference betweene the Diſciples of Chriſt, and the followers of Antichriſt, the one refuſeth the preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the world, that are offered vnto them by the Deuill, and contenteth themſelues with their vocation in the miniſtery: the other with the Pope, accepteth of al that is offered, &amp; beſides their eccleſiaſticall promotions, they hunt after temporall iuriſdictions, &amp; other proud titles of the world, to vphold and maintain their pride and ambition, for the better manifeſtation whereof, I thinke it will not bee out of ſeaſon to remember a ieſt, that was merily broken by a plaine Country fellow, vpon one of the Popes Chaplaines, the Biſhoppe of Cullen, who paſſing on a iourney ſumptuouſly moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and gorgeouſly furniſhed, both himſelf and al the reſt that were in his company, was encountered by a rude country fellow, who comming to the Biſhop, after hee had bluntly ſaluted him, he ſaide, my Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:16373:18"/>
I haue heard ſpeaking of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and of ſome others that were reputed to be good and godly men, I may well commend their goodnes, but I will neuer prayſe their wit, for they were glad to amble about the country on foot, for falling followed (perhaps) with ſome poore thred bare fellowes like themſelues, but I ſee God hath prouided for your Lordſhip better then for them, or your wiſedome is the more to prouide ſo well for your ſelfe.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop that heard himſelfe to bee thus pretily nipt, returned this anſwere; but ſirra (ſaid he) you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake your text, you thinke I take more ſtate vppon me, then is befitting an Apoſtle; but let <hi>Peter &amp; Paul</hi> goe or ride how they liſt, I am not only the Biſhoppe of Cullen, but I am ouer and beſides a Prince Elector: and for this ſtate that you thinke I take vpon mee, as you thinke it to be too much for a Biſhoppe, ſo I know it to be too little for a prince, and thus you are anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: you haue anſwered well (ſaid the other), but good my Lord but one queſtion more, if this prince E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector, that you ſpeake of, do happen to goe to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill for his pride, what will become of my Lord Biſhop of Cullen?</p>
            <p>We might make the like demaund to the Pope, who notwithſtanding his humble p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

this ambition in Popes: ſo, ambition was it again, that firſt deſtroyed Religion: but for the tru profeſſors of the Goſpell (I proteſt) I thinke it a ſinne, to carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ill conceit againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe praiers vnto God doth ſo appeaſe his diſpleaſure towardes vs, that hee many times forbeareth to puniſh vs, when wee haue worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerued it: and as the prayers of <hi>Moſes</hi> did rather procure the victory againſt <hi>Amalecke,</hi> then all the ſwordes that did accompany <hi>Ioſua</hi> to the fight: ſo I beleeue that the petition of one godly man, deliuered with a confident zeale, is of more effect then the prayers of a multitude, that are but breathed in words, and are rather vttered from the mouth, then procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the heart.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus placed the Diuine in the formoſt rank; the Souldier is next to be preferred: for honor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wanting in thoſe men of valour, that haue reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their country their bloud, which their conntrie firſt gaue vnto them: if wee ſtand vpon birth onely, then the moſt auncient, whether in Nobility or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility: if we ſtand vpon deſert, then the martiall man, hee that doth deliuer his country from the ſeruitude of ſtrangers, the oppreſſion of Tyrantes, that doth countermaund the miſeries of ciuill diſſentions, that doth reſtraine the pride<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ambition of aſpiring trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that doth inlarge their territories, defend their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, vphold and maintaine Iuſtice, and make hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable defence againſt all inuaders.</p>
            <p>The Souldier is the man that holdeth the whole world in awe, and is not onely a ſure defence againſt forraine inuaſions, but likewiſe againſt domeſticall rebellions: wee need not in this caſe to ſeeke after

farre fet precedents, when wee haue home examples inough of our own, who hath not heard of <hi>Iack Straw, Iacke Cade</hi> and of <hi>Ket,</hi> with many others now of later times in Ireland, that if the Souldiers ſworde had not beene of greater vertue, then a writ out of the Kinges Bench, to haue brought them before my Lord Chiefe Iuſtice, they would neither haue made appearance nor haue paid fees.</p>
            <p>I ſay then, that the execution of Iuſtice lieth in Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but (me thinkes) I ſee a Lawyer laugh at this, for thoſe that bee of the ſorrier ſort of Lawyers, will in no wiſe that the Souldier ſhould bee a maintainer of Iuſtice, for that they onely would arrogate to themſelues: but for the better credite of the matter, I will ſalute my Maiſters of the Law with a few wordes deliuered by S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and thus they follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valiant men that do defend their Country, and protect the Weale from ſpoile and ruine, doe the office of true iuſtice;</hi> Souldiers do protect the common wealth, and they defend it from all ſorts of ſpoile, eyther forraine or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine, but onely, they cannot ſaue it from the ſpoyle of the Lawyers.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus placed the Deuine and now the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, in the third ranke are to march, thoſe that doe compoſe and compound lawes and ordinances, for the maintenance of right and ciuill ſociety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amongſt theſe the venerable and reuerend Iudges, and all other that are eſtabliſhed in office and authority vnder Princes, but eſpecially, if they execute their places with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and honeſty.</p>
            <p>The Lawyers will neuer thinke mee to be a good Sariant Maior, to martiall them thus in the Rereward,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16373:19"/>
that would ranke themſelues with the formoſt; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, in the time of peace, for they take themſelues to bee the onely Agents of a happy gouernment.</p>
            <p>It is our wickednes that maketh the Lawyer neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; ſo neceſſity is it, that maketh him honourable, &amp; therefore he is not to march in equall ranke, neither with the Souldier, nor with the Philoſopher.</p>
            <p>The principall office of the Law is, in the time of peace to commaund thinges honeſt and vertuous, and to forbid what is diſhoneſt and vicious; but what can the Lawyer doe with his preſcriptions, before there be a ſetled obedience, which is firſt to bee eſtabliſhed by the Souldier?</p>
            <p>It is truth, the Lawyer and the Souldier could neuer thriue both in one ſhire, and therefore no maruell though they crie out with <hi>Tully, Caedant arma togae,</hi> for, theſe doe not onely loue to ſleepe in a whole skin, and are afraid of knockes, but vnder the pretence of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring peace, they would both excuſe their cowardize, and would arrogate to themſelues a ſupreame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to be the principall pillars to conſerue and vphold peace; and becauſe <hi>Tully</hi> would haue it, that weapons ſhould giue place to the gown, they would from hence conclude, that the Souldier muſt giue place to the Lawyer; but as good lucke would haue it, <hi>Tully</hi> himſelfe in the ſame booke of <hi>Officis,</hi> hath bequeathed a double honour vnto thoſe men, who armed do make warre, and robbed do gouerne the common wealth: and the Poets haue fained <hi>Minerua</hi> to be armed, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying, that Captains and Souldiers, ſhould be as wiſe in counſailing, as couragious in conquering as politike in keeping, as valiant in getting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16373:20"/>
But to put all queſtions out of doubt, and that the Lawyer ſhould not thinke himſelfe diſgraſt, by giuing place to the Souldier, I wil proue by ſufficient inſtance that the profeſſion of Armes is more honourable then the profeſſion of Law, and ſo by conſequence the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is of greater worth and excellency then the Lawyer.</p>
            <p>The affaires of warre is a knowledge behoueful for the greateſt Monarch, when a king is not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for his crowne, as for his skill in knowledge of Armes. The nine Worthies of the worlde, were Martiall men, reputed honourable for their prowes, not for their knowledge eyther in Law or Philoſophy though the knowledge of them both be of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</p>
            <p>Although all the gifts of Fortune are to be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in reſpect of learning; yet there is nothing ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as to bee called a great Captaine, or a worthie Souldier: and it was very neatly anſwered by him, who being demanded by his friend, whether hee had rather to be <hi>Achilles or Homer;</hi> asked the other again, whether he had rather to be a Captaine or a Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: letters are but the ornaments of Armes, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is more neceſſary for a man of Warre, then for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other profeſſion.</p>
            <p>The aduentures vndertaken by warre, the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation is glory; but he that ſauoureth not the fruits of letters, hath as little feeling in the greatnes of glory. A man that is ignorant in Artes, can neuer excell in Armes, and as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayeth; Happy is that common wealth, where eyther the Prince is a Philoſopher, or where a Philoſopher is a prince: ſo it may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16373:20"/>
a fortunate warre, where the chiefe Commander is a great ſcholler, or a great ſcholler is the chiefe Commaunder.</p>
            <p>What made the Romaines to become ſo famous, but that their Captaines and Commaunders were as great ſchollers as they were warriours? it is not exerciſe in warre, that maketh euery man fit to be a Captaine, though he follow the profeſſion neuer ſo long, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if he be vnlearned; yet there is none ſo vnapt for the warre, but if he be lettered, it ſo much the more helpeth his experience.</p>
            <p>A man that is aged (let his yeares be neuer ſo many) yet he ſeeth but the thinges that are done in his owne time, but the learned man ſeeth not onely his owne age and experience, but whatſoeuer hath beene done many hundred yeares paſt, yea ſince the firſt Writer tooke penne in hand: and therefore aſwell amongſt Souldiers, as amongſt all other profeſſions, the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned muſt giue place to the learned, for no memorie can compare with writing. And as amongſt the vnlearned, he that hath liued foureſcore yeares, muſt haue more experience, then hee that hath liued but forty: ſo hee that ſeeth by bookes the accidents of a thouſand yeares, knoweth more then hee that by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a hundred yeares is able to attaine vnto.</p>
            <p>I might inferre examples of excellent Captaines of old time, which all enioyed the ornament of letters, with the prowes of Armes.</p>
            <p>It is well knowne that <hi>Alexander</hi> had <hi>Homer</hi> in ſuch reuerent eſtimation, that hee laid his Iliades alwayes vnder his beds head; and hee applyed diligently not thoſe ſtudies onely, but alſo the ſpeculation of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,

vnder the diſcipline of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>

               <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in like manner increaſed his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, aſwel by letters, as with the inſtructions of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> What diligence <hi>Caeſar</hi> vſed in ſtudy, his owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges doe ſufficiently make manifeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipto Affricanus</hi> would not goe without the bookes of <hi>Xenophon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might further ſpeake of <hi>Lucullus, Scilla, Pompeius, Brutus,</hi> and of many other both Romaines and Greti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that were famous Souldiers and great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, &amp; how conuerſant a matter it hath been in times paſt for Arts &amp; Arms to march together in one ranke.</p>
            <p>This might ſuffice to proue that the dignity of the ſoldier is not beſtowed vpon him <hi>gratis,</hi> or (as it were) without deſert; but that it appertaineth vnto him by property and right, and but according to his owne merite; then who is more fit to manage the affaires of peace, as hee that hath an able iudgement to know what is fit both for peace and warre.</p>
            <p>But it hath beene a former queſtion, &amp; diſputation hath beene had many yeares ſithens, what profeſſion might be thought to be moſt worthy; and ſundry men haue hereupon giuen their ſeuerall cenſures.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Oridanias</hi> was wont to ſay to the Cicilians, that to the ſacrificing Prieſtes of the Temple, moſt honour was due; whereby it may appeare, that the religious from the beginning were had in reuerent eſtimation: &amp; it was not giuen them without ſome conſideration, for as it is recorded, the Prieſtes of <hi>Diana</hi> were limited to their ſeuerall ſeaſons, the firſt wherein they might learn wiſedom, the ſecond, wherein to exerciſe it them ſelues, and the third, to inſtruct others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Brias</hi> king of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giues,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:16373:21"/>
gaue moſt honor to the Philoſophers that read in ſchooles. <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> amongſt the Romains, was of opinion, that he was worthy of moſt reputation, to whom had happened the victory of any famous battel and that was fortunate in warre.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> the Philoſopher, ordained amongſt the Phenitians, that in a common wealth, ſuch ſhoulde be eſpecially honoured, who in the time of peace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained the ſtate in tranquility; and in the fury of war, was found to bee a valiant protector of the limites and liberties of his country, concurring with that of <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> who likewiſe preferreth to the higheſt degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; thoſe, who armed doe make warre, and robbed, do rule and gouerne the common wealth: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this little pauſe of peace, hath euen almoſtlulde vs in that ſecurity, that now the ſouldier hath hanged vp his armor a ruſting by the wals, they would likewiſe hang himſelfe a ruſting with his Armes, I thinke it not amiſſe therefore to giue him a litle furbuſhing, though not to caſt him into any counterfeit colour, or ſo to verniſh or gild him, wherby to make him more bright by Art then he is of himſelfe by Nature: a litle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to rub out the canker, that time hath already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun for to eate, I will make him as well as I can, to gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and ſhine in his own vertue.</p>
            <p>Warre is a miniſter of Gods iuſtice for ſinne, God is not the author of ill, but the chaſticer of abuſe; he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the will of Princes to puniſh or reuenge: the Souldiers as obedient Subiectes, are the Miniſter to performe: if power were not to maintaine Princes proceedinges, the Prince might ſometimes bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt of his Eſtate; cruell handes woulde bee
<pb facs="tcp:16373:22"/>
layed on the Miniſtery, yea, the Lawyers woulde bee pulde from the Barre, and the Iudge pluckt downe from the place of Iuſtice; ſo that in peace the name of a Souldier reſtreyneth the rebellions, and in warre, maketh ſubiect the proudeſt reſiſter.</p>
            <p>The Souldier referreth himſelfe to the will of the prince, the prince is not diſpoſed but by the direction of God, who ſince hee is the gouernour of euery actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I dare auow they are not vicious.</p>
            <p>It may be obiected, that in the proud attemptes of Princes, the Souldier is ſtill preſent, not reſpecting the cauſe ſo much as his owne profite.</p>
            <p>This were a hard poſition to bee obiected againſt Lawyers, but the Souldier being a ſubiect, is tied to follow his Prince: but in iniurious enterpriſes, I know there are Souldiers, that are as contrary to the warre as he that is moſt ready to reprehend: who by proofe and not by geſſe, do conclude of the euent of the battel when the cauſe proceedeth from a wrongfull ground.</p>
            <p>But let vs ſpeake of Souldiers in their minorities, when they firſt become to bee apprentiſes to Armes. In the choice of a Souldier, wee do not onely regard the ability of his body, but the quality of his minde: for if religion, circumſpection, preuention, counſell, experience, zeale, fidelity, reſolution, continency and care, be not in him that ſhould enter the profeſſion, the charge is ill lookt into; neither is ſuch a one to bee admitted, that is not thus accompliſht: then if a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of iudgement be had, when he is imployed, how liues he in the field? firſt, in the feare of God, not aſſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red of his life from one houre to another, ſurely tied to al vertuous actions, abſtinent in diet, diligent to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16373:22"/>
pleaſe, carefull to correct, dutifull to obey, tired with trauell, handes, feet, legges, thoughts and all, toyled, occupied, and employed, ſo that neither leiſure ſerues him to be idle, nor the ſeuerity of his Captaine admits him to runne aſtray: ſuch Souldiers ſhould be, and thus they ought to be employed, and if there were not ſome ſuch, the name and title were hardly beſtead.</p>
            <p>For thoſe imputations wherewith Souldiers are charged, to be raſh, rebellious, cruell, mutinous, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent &amp;c. they are but ſcandals malitiouſly impoſed: for firſt, if they were raſh, their ſucceſſe would be more infortunate, then commonly it falleth out.</p>
            <p>If rebellious, and not to bee gouerned, without doubt, <hi>Alexander</hi> had not conquered ſo many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, ſubdued ſo many kingdomes, and ouercome ſo many nations, and (as it were) but with a handfull of his Macedonians and Cretians.</p>
            <p>If bloudy minded, why then ſpared <hi>Caeſar</hi> thoſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, &amp; citizens of Rome, when both by their own hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>writing and often attempts, hee well knew to be the followers of <hi>Pompei,</hi> and his capitall enemies.</p>
            <p>If murtherous, how often might the Venetian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies haue worthily ſpoiled the whole Iland of Create, which not onely had murthered many of their famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es with the ſword, but alſo rebelled againſt them fiue or ſixe ſeuerall times.</p>
            <p>Ifincontinent, what cauſed <hi>Scipio</hi> to redeliuer that noble young Virgin, who for her paſſing beauty, and great admiration of perſon, was preſented vnto him as a rare gift; <hi>Scipio</hi> himſelfe amaſed at the ſight, would yet deliuer her to <hi>Luceias,</hi> to whome ſhee was eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and gaue him alſo for a dowrie, the gold that her
<pb facs="tcp:16373:23"/>
parents had brought to redeeme her.</p>
            <p>If couctous, how fell it out, that after <hi>L. Mumius</hi> had taken Corinth, and adorned all Italy with the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of that ſpoile, he kept ſo little to his own vſe, that the Senate was faine for very need, to giue dowry to his daughter of the common treaſure.</p>
            <p>But becauſe Rome hath beene eſpecially famed, let vs ſee from whence ſhee attained to her greatnes, we ſhall find that the Souldier was he that defended the eſtate, the Souldier was hee that made Rome notable: yea, the Souldier was he that had the creation of the Emperour. When the ſouldier had this ſway, peace was as plentifull at Rome as after it was, the reuenews of Rome greater then now they be, the abhomination of Rome leſſe then now it is: In the time of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers gouernment, Rome was renowned for her iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and was reputed to bee the miſtris of the world: now the rule is in the hand of a counterfeit prieſt, Rome is inſamed for her idolatry, and is accounted the ſcorne of the world: In the dayes of <hi>Traian,</hi> other countries ſought their lawes from Rome, now in the dayes of the Vicar of Chriſt, Rome is accounted lawles of all the world.</p>
            <p>In the loſſe of a ſouldier, how mourned <hi>Iulius Caeſar?</hi> whome not onely he dignified with great honors be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing aliue, but alſo buried with bitter teares being dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompei</hi> the great builded the city of <hi>Nicopolis</hi> to no other end but to harbour ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> the Romaine, would ſeldome giue giftes vnles it were to ſouldiers, affirming it to be vnlawfull for him that was high ſteward of the common wealth to conuert thoſe reuenewes which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16373:23"/>
did contribute, eyther to his owne ſpottes and pleaſures, eyther yet to ſpend and conſume them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his friendes and fauourites.</p>
            <p>Yea, the moſt notable Emperours, that euer yet were heard on, hath accounted of a Souldier as of his familiar, calling him his companion, and fellow in Armes. Now I haue heard of them, that haue been learned in the lawes, and ſome others likewiſe that haue beene famous Orators, that haue been entertained by Princes, but neuer reputed to be their fellowes, yet many times accounted to be their flatterers, to ſooth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp in their pleaſurs, and to follow and vphold them in their idle humors.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, for the maintenance of a good Plea, a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer may get a little popular praiſe; but the ſouldier, for ſubduing an enemy to Rome, had the honor of a Triumph. I might here enlarge a great deale of other matter fitting to my purpoſe: but will you heare what teſtimony the holy Scriptures will affoorde vs in the commendation of Souldiers? in the 3. of <hi>Luke,</hi> amongſt a number of all ſorts of people that came to <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> aſwell to heare him preach, as alſo to bee baptiſed, the ſoldiers were not behind, but ſtired vp with the like godly zeale, they came amonſt the reſt, deſirous to bee inſtructed in the way of their ſaluation, and as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had done before them, they demaunded of <hi>Iohn</hi> what they might do to inherite heauen; the Prophet rendring no rough reply, mildly ſaid vnto them, <hi>Doc no violence, but be content with your pay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I ſhold a litle paraphraſe of this Text I might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily make it appeare, that ſouldiers are not ſo puffed vp with deſire of a little tranſitory glory, that they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb facs="tcp:16373:24"/>
the glory that ſhall endure world without end.</p>
            <p>The Captaine againe, that ſent vnto Ieſus aboute helping of his ſicke ſeruant, as our Sauiour was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards his houſe, hee was encountred by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond meſſenger, acknowledging himſelfe vnworthy to receiue him vnder his roofe, beſeeching him but only to ſpeake the word, and he knew his ſeruant ſhould be ſafe, whereat our Lord himſelfe wondred, and turning him to thoſe that followed, he ſaid, <hi>I haue not found ſo great faith, no, not in Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is yet mention made in the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, of <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Captaine, a deuout man, &amp; one that feared God, with all his houſhold, to whom an Angell appearing, willed him to ſend to Ioppa for <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> who ſhould inſtruct him, and baptiſe him in the name of Ieſus Chriſt; and the Captaine called vnto him a deuout Souldier (for thoſe be the wordes of the Text) whome he ſent with others, about this meſſage.</p>
            <p>This Teſtimony we haue in the new Teſtament of Souldiers that were godly enclined: but I doe not finde mention made of any Lawyer, but of thoſe that came amongſt the Scribes and Phariſies, that ſought ſtill to tempt and crucifie Chriſt, againſt whome our Sauiour himſelfe, pronounced, <hi>VVoe be to you Lawyers, for you loade men with beaute burdens to be borne: but you your ſelues will not touch them with your little fingers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I haue trauelled a large circuit, and by what is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy paſt, it might well inough appeare, that he is moſt beneficiall to his Country, whoſe body executeth what his wiſedome plotteth, I might yet holde on a larger iourney, but I thinke it needles, and therefore I meane to weary my ſelfe no further.</p>

But I cannot ſee what the Lawyer can challenge of his country, the lawyer (I meane) that makes his plea but for his priuate profite, whole onely contemplation hath but regard to his owne cofers.</p>
            <p>In the beginning, when <hi>Iuſtinians Radices</hi> were not knowne, but the law of the Tables were taught, then the law was not in the ciuill magiſtrate to diſpoſe, but the Prieſt had it to propound: that law was deliuered by ſucceſſion, and confirmed by the preſence of the Law-giuer: and whilſt that law was continued, Iſrael was partaker of the promiſe; the Heathen fell before them, for the Lord of hoſtes was amongſt them, but in continuance of time, as ſinne and corruption began to encreaſe, the lawes likewiſe began to multiply: for it is offence that begetteth lawes, and from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of men, it is that good laws do proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dioniſius</hi> of <hi>Siracuſa</hi> (though otherwiſe a tyrant) yet hee made a Law, that thoſe that exceſſiuely gaue them ſelues to banqueting, ſhould bee puniſhed with great aſperity: <hi>Licurgus</hi> made a Law againſt drunkennes, <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> againſt pompious buildings, the <hi>Luca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> againſt prodigality, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in apparrell, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> againſt whoredome &amp; adultery, the Thebians, againſt negligent parents, that brought vp their children in idlenes and inſolencie, the Romaines againſt thoſe maiſters, that were too ſeuere and cruell to their ſeruants; and there was a Law eſtabliſhed in Rome, called <hi>Iulia,</hi> the tenor wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was, that no man ſhould be ſo hardy to ſhut vp his dores, whilſt they were at dinner, that the officers of the City might haue the more eaſie acceſſe to ſee if their ordinary did not exeede their ability.</p>

            <p>This Canon may be anihilated by this learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, that diſtinction fruſtrated by that Expoſitor, and what not turned Topſieturuy, to ſerue the ſeaſon for the Lawyers commodity.</p>
            <p>There is no agreement amongſt themſelus, for what they confirm to day, to morrow they diſauow; looke into their own Canons, conſider of the firſt inſtitution of their laws politique, poſitiue, and prouinciall, and there will be found ſo many corrections, ſo many fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, ſo many anticipations, ſo many cauteles, and ſuch ſeuerall expoſitions, as the ſtudient had need e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day of a new memory, to conſider of his newe coated clauſe. With this multiplicity of laws, there is likewiſe crept in ſuch a ſuperaboundance of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, that by wreſting and corrupting of the lawes, doe maintaine themſelues, their wiues and their family, in preſumption and pride.</p>
            <p>Theſe bee they that with <hi>Protulus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,</hi> by their iniurious cauillations, wil deſtroy the cauſe of <hi>Otho</hi> their familiar friend, and will not let wickedly to betray him to <hi>Vitelius</hi> for a little gaine.</p>

            <p>Theſe be they, by whoſe corruptions, the lawes are made but Traps and Traines, where by both rich and poore are caught and ſpoiled, and how many Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Orators haue we, that wil counterfeit the Squinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for a litle gaine, and yet are to open mouthed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the poore mans proceſſe, that will make their plea, but according to the peny, that will come de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes from Tearme to Tearme, from time to time, from yeare to yeare, that haue ſo many ſhifts, and are ſo ful of colluſion, that I proteſt, I doe not know any thing wherein wee ſtand in greater need, then of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident and godly lawes, whereby to curbe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the corruptions of the greateſt number of our Lawyers, but eſpecially from the deteſtable exactions of thoſe that bee Clarkes and vnder officers, that are cryed out vpon by poore ſutors, for their extorting &amp; taking of vnreaſonable fees.</p>

nor Iudge to dete mine it, in ſuch a caſe (by the lawes of all nations, the triall is ſtill referred to the lawes of Armes, from a Company of wrangling Aduocates, that with their ſophiſtications doe hunt after continual darknes, to the honourable preſcriptions ſet down by Souldiers, that to diſcouer falſhood, to bring hidden practiſes to open light, to make their trials by way of Combat, preſuppoſing that God, who onely knoweth the ſecrets of all things, will giue victory to him that aduentureth his life for iuſtice and right.</p>
            <p>This ſuppoſition is not vainely grounded, for hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are full of examples: how many vngratious and vngodly practiſes haue beene diſcouered and laide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and of many other trials that haue beene made by thoſe honourable incounters of Combat, &amp; ſomtimes determined by Martiall court?</p>
            <p>But the Souldiers confidence is not to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, who referring the equity of his cauſe to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous iudgement of God, doe neither ſeeke for loue, nor for fauour, nor for gaine, neither arethey drawne by any manner of corruption, to obſcure matters, to darken them, or to ſhut them vp in a golden cloude: or after three or foure yeares continuance in ſute, to make them more intricate then they were the very firſt day they were commenced.</p>
            <p>No, the martiall law is of a more ſpeedy diſpatch, it ſeeketh no corners, it neither vpholdeth wrong, nor ſuppreſſeth right: I may therefore conclude with a good conſcience, that if there be not ſome difference in the lawes themſelues, yet in the adminiſtration there is a great inequality.</p>
            <p>I would not wiſh you to belecuc for all this, that I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16373:26"/>
would haue all ſutes, all quarrels, and all manner of controuerſies to be tried by martiall law: doe you aske me, how I would then haue them ended? I proteſt I will tell you what I would doe my ſelfe in ſuch a caſe; I would walke Powles till I were weary, but I woulde meet with him that wold ſay, had don him wrong, or betweene whome and my ſelfe, there were like to ariſe any cauſe of contention or ſute in law; and hauing once found him, he ſhould be very hard hearted, but I would intice him to a Tauerne, where calling for a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of wine, and placing it at the vpper end of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I would make it an arbitrator between vs for that time, and I would likewiſe draw in ſome other of our friendes and acquaintance, that if the wine ſhoulde be too hote or too furious in his execution, they ſhould moderate and qualifie his rigour with ſome indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: you know my meaning, if it were a matter of a thouſand pounds weight, I had rather abide a triall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt neighbours and friendes, (that might make a quicke diſpatch) and a quiet end, then to follow a ſute at Weſtminſter Hall, that will ſcarſe be finiſhed in an age, eſpecially, if the matter bee doubtfull or intricate. To conclude, I would not wiſh a wiſe man to goe to Law at all, if it were poſſible; marry, if there bee no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, arme your ſelfe with patience, and ſtore your purſe with crownes; for be ſure, you ſhall haue occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to vſe both the one and the other: for the Lawyer and the Vintner too, are very coſtly if they bee well followed, and they do both of them make their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt gainby ſelling of the Elements, for the one ſels water, and the other ſels wind; but <hi>caueat Emptor,</hi> for he that ſels wine, though it be but by the pint, wil game

            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> ſeeing the inconuenience that grew in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth by the prouocation of Lawyers, that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and maintained diſhoneſt ſutes &amp; quarrels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt neighbors and friends; wiſhed that the courts of Pleas might be ſet with trappes and ingines, to catch and inſnarle the profeſſors of that ſtudy of law: and <hi>Fardinando</hi> ſending a vyz-Roy into the Indies then newly diſcouered, he forbad him to carry any Lawyers with him, to the end they might not ſow the ſeedes of ſutes.</p>
            <p>I hope I ſhall not be miſtaken (by thoſe that are wiſe) nor my wordes conſtrued to the worſt meaning (by thoſe that are honeſt) for I am not ignorant of manie worthie Gentlemen that are profeſſors of the law, and I thinke both the ſtudy and adminiſtration of law, to be moſt befitting and behouefull for Gentlemen: for what are they but this baſe borne broode, that cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16373:27"/>
into the Innes of Court, and hauing a little ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped together a few fragments &amp; ſcrapings of the law, becauſe they would not mend ſhoos, foot ſtockinges, driue the cart, and do as their fathers did before them; they neither care what lawes they peruert, nor what Clients they conſume; theſe be they againſt whome I haue all this while whetted my penne; with others I haue not had to deale.</p>
            <p>For the graue and reuerent Iudges, Fathers and Founders of the Law, my penne hath not touched, no, far be it from me to thinke an euill thought, much leſſe to detect them. There be many other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, both of name and bloud that I know are not to be detected; amongſt the which, ſome I loue for their honeſty, ſome I reuerence for their quality, and ſome I honour for their excellency many wayes expreſſed, but eſpecially in their liues: amongſt the reſt that are now remainant in the realme of Ireland, one that hath made himſelfe more famous then the reſt, and therefore aboue the reſt in that Region moſt worthy ſo to be famed. I need not blaze his name, for he that hath but learned to know himſelfe, hath heard of him. I might ſay more but I need not, for he hath ſaid more for himſelfe then I am able to ſay.</p>
            <p>For a full concluſion of this, I proteſt, that I doe not know any man in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, a profeſſor of the law, either one or other that I do malice; there be a number that I do loue, and I loue them for their owne vertue and worthines: neyther can I ſpeake any ill of any one particular perſon amongſt them of mine owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; neither haue I heard the abuſes of theſe petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fogging fellowes more bitterly reprehended, then I
<pb facs="tcp:16373:28"/>
haue heard amongſt Lawyers themſelues that are of the moſt worthieſt ſorte, and beſt learned in the lawes.</p>
            <p>And now to returne to the ſubiect that I haue taken in hand, I ſay it is the beſt gentrie that is attayned by Armes or by learning, but beſt of all by both, and hee doth hardly deſerue the title of a Gentleman, that is not aduanced by one or both; they are farre deceiued to thinke, that a little wealth, or a bare office, may make a man worthy of eſtimation, that is not attained vnto by deſert, or accompliſhed by vertue: to gaine a reputation, to bee accounted wiſe or vertuous, many wiſe and vertuous acts are required; but for a man to make himſelfe to bee eſteemed for a foole, one fooliſh act ſufficeth: and therefore a man had neede to take heede how hee marries a wife, that is of the flanting humour.</p>
            <p>Some do think to aſpite to gentility by their welth, but that were a baſe foundation, for riches are moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly heaped together by corruptions, by extortions by exactions, by oppreſſions, and by many other like, ſeruile functions.</p>
            <p>And a man would laugh to heare ſome of theſe Hogelings (if they bee in company) what they will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to themſelues, you ſhall ſee a fellow that was but lately digde out of a dung hill, whoſe wit and honeſty both, doth onely conſiſt but in compaſſing of crownes; that will take more ſtate vppon him, then hee that is able to manage a princes Army in the field.</p>
            <p>Some others doe thinke, that the greateſt grace of gentility doth conſiſt in gawdy ſhowes, in fooliſh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16373:28"/>
and to be like <hi>Protenus</hi> the God of ſhapes. Some their greateſt vertue is, to poure it in, and to put it out againe: ſome doe thinke to bee regiſtred in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldes bookes, for wearing hayre of the new cut, one will haue it ſhort, another will haue it long, an other will haue his loue locke, or his lady locke, (or call it what you will) that ſhall hang dangling by his eare, an excellent place of Ambuſcado, to ſheltre Nits &amp; Lice.</p>
            <p>There be ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in their actions do affect honour, who in their ambition will proteſt of great wonders, and what they would bring to paſſe, if they had beene borne mighty, which ſort of men are commonly much talked of, but little cared for, when honour doth beſt ſhow her ſelfe in him, that doth rather ſeeke merite; then hunt after fame; yet I haue knowne of ſome of theſe aſpiring potentates, that were aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their own parentage, but would challenge their alliance from ſome Lord, or from ſome knight, like the Mule that being dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of his birth, being aſhamed to confeſſe that hee was the ſonne of an Aſſe; anſwered that he was coſen Germaine to a Horſe. In euery wel gouerned common wealth, men of learning, vertue &amp; honeſty are aduanced and preferred, for dignity in an vnworthy perſon, is like a precious ſtone, that is ſet in baſe mettell, or like a ruſty rapier in a veluet ſcaberd: but opinion is a perilous fellow, and I thinke there is not a more coſening thing in the world, for it decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Kings, Princes, Dukes, Earles, Lords, and what is he that is not ouer reached by opinion?</p>
            <p>It draweth moſt to great fortunes, and it is bred and foſtered by the breath of the vulgar.</p>
            <p>It preferreth men to dignities, to offices &amp; places of
<pb facs="tcp:16373:29"/>
authority aſwell in the time of peace, as in the time of warre, for where opinion beareth ſway, ſhee rules like a God, ſhe makes fooles to bee reputed wiſe, cowards to be called couragious, and ſilly ignorant men to be admired for iudgement and skill.</p>
            <p>Opinion is a burre that ſtill cleaueth to the mighty, and it is more nice &amp; fooliſh to pleaſe, then iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
            <p>Opinion is the mother of hypocriſie, it is blind, it is lame, it is ſelfe conceited, and it hath preuailed ſo farre that we want but another <hi>Eraſmus</hi> to deifie Opinion, as one hath already writ in the prayſe of Folly.</p>
            <p>Opinion is moſt ſmoothed by thoſe that doe affect and hunt after it themſelues, and that is commonly by men of the baſeſt condition, by ſuch as doe thirſt after promotion, as tale bearers, newes carriers, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſome too thinke to creepe into the very guts of Opinion, with drinking a health; ſome to winne Opinion, are excellent in diſcourſe at a table, they will talke of their owne actiuity, how many fraies they made in Fleetſtreet, what Ladies and Gentlewomen came to viſite them when they lay ſicke of the tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, and they will ſometimes vaunt of a fauour from their miſtres, that were ſcorned by the maide: and bar them from this or other like talke, and they are as vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnfurniſht as a chimnies end in a countrie houſe without a pudding, or a peece of bacon. I haue ſeene ſome of theſe fellowes that are of the ietting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, that do thinke to reach at opinion by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements and quaint deuiſes, that will diſpute of intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate matters, that profeſſe to bee ſeene in all faculties, that will ſpeake by diſtinct ſpaces, and will refute all men by innouation of Method, that can ſometimes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16373:29"/>
ſpeake well, and alwayes liue ill.</p>
            <p>He that ſwaggereth and ſweareth, and ſpeaketh not a word, but it is full of terrour, that threatneth the ſtabbe or ſome other deadly blowe, that is able to diſmember a man with the verie breath of his diſpleaſure, that can ſhake him all to tatters, but vpon the point of his tongue, that is as fearefull to beholde, as the Gentleman that durſt not looke in a glaſſe when hee was angry, for affrighting himſelfe with the terror of his owne countenance, that ſcorneth to cut vppe the Gooſe-pie, that ſcorneth to drinke to him that will not pledge him a full cuppe, that ſcorneth ſometime to pay his debts; all this and more too, is, but to winne opinion, and ſo from thence to ſteppe to preferment.</p>
            <p>I neuer found leſſe performance in deedes, then in ſome of theſe prating fellowes, that are ſo ful of words; but for my part if I hit into their company, when I heare their tongues beginne to wagge, I liſten to their talke, as I liſten to a Bagge-pipe, that the lowder it ſqueyles, the more abiect I hold the muſicke.</p>
            <p>Now for this inſinuating baſenes that dooth woo preferment, as if ſhe were a wench to bee wonne with preſents, with prayſes, and with flattery; a faire worde, a ſmiling looke, or a flattering ſhow, were recompence good inough for thoſe creatures of ſeruitude.</p>
            <p>For mine owne part, I haue euer ſcornd to purchaſe reputation, or to ſeeke aduancement, by ducking, by crowching, by deiecting and proſtrating my ſelfe at mens feet, to ſubmit to a voluntary profeſſed ſeruitude, to daunce attendance, ſometimes three houres by the clocke, and then to bee bleſt with a <hi>Nod,</hi> commende it he that liſt, I cannot like it, neither do I loue to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb facs="tcp:16373:30"/>
the idolatry of out age, to make mortal men ſaints, to worſhip, to adore, to creepe, to crouch, &amp; to make offerings: if any of theſe interpreting fellowes will ſay, I ſtand too much in my owne conceite, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (perhaps) will not ſticke to breake a ieſt or two behind my backe, to get the ſtart of ſuch deprauers (&amp; a litle to preuent them) I befoole him a fore hand, that doth thinke me ſo ſimple, as not to bee able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betweene ſeruile flattery and beſeeming curteſie; but to ſubmit my ſelfe to a baſe kinde of ſubmiſſion, to begge a litle preferment: let them winne that way thoſe that liſt, I hold the gaine to be more abiect and baſe, then <hi>Veſpaſians</hi> gaine gotten by vtine:</p>
            <p>But of all fortunes that might befall mee, it woulde anger me to the heart, to creepe into an office (yea, if it were into Knighthood it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) more for my wiues ſake, then for mine own worth.</p>
            <p>I will ſpeake no more of my ſelfe: but what indirect aſpiring is this, that to attaine to a little title of dignity, we ſhall make our ſelues to be laughing ſtocks, and to be holden contemptible in ſeeking a dignity, not being able to vphold the reputation of the place?</p>
            <p>It is a counterfeit faſhion to face the outſide with a litle ſatten, or ſome other like ſtuffe of a glorious ſhow, and to patch and peece the inſide with tatters &amp; rags of litle worth: me thinkes there bee ſome, that if they did but examine and looke into their owne dignities, they ſhould bee very angry, becauſe they ſhould find them to looke with ſquint eyes, wrie mouthes, and flearing countenance, as though they derided &amp; moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at their maſters.</p>
            <p>This eye beguiling glory deceiueth none but fooles
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16373:30"/>
and it is like the Gloweworme, that ſhineth a little in the darke, but in the light of the day, wee diſcerne it to bee but a paltry worme.</p>
            <p>I haue hitherto but ſpoke of Gentlemen, that do not know their owne places, nor many times how to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall themſelues but with diſorder, iniuring and wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging others, and ſome of them with ſuch vnreaſonable preſumption as might turne to offence, and ſo to a quarrell; I hold it not vnneceſſary now (according to my promiſe) to ſay ſomething of Knightes, amongeſt whom (if there be not ſome miſtaking by the Heralds) there is ſome inequality and difference between them.</p>
            <p>The time hath been, when the Yeomandry of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land did flouriſh, and were had in ſome account, but after the prouerbe began to grow in cuſtome. That euery lacke would be a Gentleman, our Yeomandry beganne to faint, and euen then to decay, and now our Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are as farre out of date, and this ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe approued to bee in full ſtrength and vertue, that is, Eyther a Knight or a knitter of Caps: for wee are now ſo full of Knights, that Gentlemen are had in little requeſt: the order of knighthood is auncient, &amp; the dignity in ages paſt, hath beene accounted hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, neither was it giuen but to ſuch as were able to countenance the place and had ability (both of wealth and wit) to gratifie their country, to benefite the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, yea and to be aiders and aſſiſtants to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in all their affaires, eyther in the time of peace, or in the time of warre.</p>
            <p>Such they haue beene, and ſome ſuch there be ſtil, but amongſt them there be as vnworthy, as the others are worthy, and here is the difference and inequality
<pb facs="tcp:16373:31"/>
betweene them.</p>
            <p>The one are knowne by their troupes of ſeruantes, that are attendant and waiting vpon them; the other are knowne by a poore Page or Lackey, or if they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> get a pild fellow or two in a thred bare Liuerie, it is a greater traine then ſome of their Fathers, or other of their predeceſſors before them were able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p>The one are knowne by their hoſpitality and good houſe-keeping, aſwell in the City as in the Country, the other are knowne by their frequent to other mens tables, that are not able to giue a meales meate, nor ſcarſly to eate a good one (at their own coſts and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) from one Sonday to another.</p>
            <p>The one are knowne by the authority and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they beare in the common wealth, and are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced for their wiſedom, and renowned by their own deſert, the other are better knowne for their wiues va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, then for their owne vertue, and not ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced for their own wit, as for their wiues wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. To be ſhort, the one are beloued of all for their wiſedome, and the other are ſcorned of al for their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I cannot tell whether it be an inconuenience to a common wealth, to haue ſo many vnworthy perſons puft vp into prid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; but this I anſwere, that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the vnable ſort muſt vphold their pride, either by begging from the prince, or by ſhifting or ſcambling in the common wealth: for ſir <hi>Giles</hi> himſelfe muſt haue his ſatten ſuite, and my good Lady his wife, muſt needs haue her Coach, for to ſee a Lady to walke the ſtreetes without a Coatch, is like my Lord Maior, when he comes from Weſtminſter without a Pageant, or like
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16373:31"/>
a Shroue Tueſday without a pancake.</p>
            <p>For as Knightes grow poore, ſo Ladies grow proude, and when a Lady is out of the new Faſhion ſhee is like a ſhippe that is out of Trim, ſhee will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſteare well.</p>
            <p>The Romaines would neuer admit any man to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the name eyther of knight or gentleman, that had not ſerued in the warres, neither would they dignifie any man with any of thoſe titles, but ſuch as had been famed for their ſeruice in the field, or otherwiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for ſome excellent vertue: me thinks it were well if this were obſerued in the inſtitution of knights, and that as good reſpect might be had to their ability of welth, as to their ability of wit, and although I doe here yoke wealth with vertue, yet I do make wealth to be but the handmaid to vertue, for the exerciſe of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality is many times as neceſſary for a knight as chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualry: but now we ſhall ſooner meet with ſir <hi>Dinnaden</hi> or ſir <hi>Dagonet</hi> at a dinner, then ſir <hi>Lancelot du Lake,</hi> or ſir <hi>Truſtrum de Liones</hi> in the field.</p>
            <p>Some doe hold, that amongſt Knights, he is to haue the firſt place, that had his firſt creation, and this is it that I haue laboured all this while to impugne: for what a diſparagement were this, that a man that were firſt by birth a Gentleman diſcended of worthy parents, trayned and foſtered vp from his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry infancy in knowledge and vnderſtanding, that is of able reuenew to keepe hoſpitality, and to relieue the poorer ſort that are inhabiting about him, whoſe wiſedom and experience hath beene both tried and well approued, in his loue and ſeruice ſhowne, aſwell to his Prince as to his country, and ſuch a one being
<pb facs="tcp:16373:32"/>
worthily dignified to the order of knighthood, for his vertue and well deſeruing, another that is but baſe by birth, compaſſed (perhaps) with ſome meaſur of welth but not with an inch of wit; ſome of them not greatlie peſtered, neyther with wealth nor wit, his beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, a litle pride and a great deale of ignorance) yet one of theſe little worthy creatures, creeping into a knighthood, whether by fauour, whether by fortune perhaps by fraud, but I am ſure, neither by merite nor by deſert, ſhould yet ſhoulder the other from the wal, becauſe he had his creation an howre or two before him.</p>
            <p>I could here find in my heart to chide (and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely) but eſpecially in the behalfe of Ladies, I meane of thoſe Ladies that may bee ſaid to bee truely legitimate: for there bee of Ladies, as there bee of knightes, ſome in ſubſtance, and ſome in ſhow: but for thoſe that bee Ladies aſwell in nature as by name, I reuerence thoſe, nay I honor them, &amp; although I know their vertuous inclination to be more ready to pardon, then willing to reuenge, yet what gentle ſpirite would not be grieued in their behalfes, to ſee a baſe borne Madam, whoſe mother would haue beene glad to haue beene a good Ladies Landres, and yet ſhe will pranke and pearch, yea and ſometimes contend with her for place and ſuperiority, that hath had her betters to attend her in her chamber. I did once know one of theſe femall kind, that the beſt bringing vp ſhe had whilſt ſhe dwelt with her owne mother (I thinke) was to ſtudy the Arte of Nauigation: ſhee had dayly fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent amongſt Saylers and Seafaring men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in continuance of time ſhee fell to practiſe the <hi>Iacobs</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:16373:32"/>
               <hi>ſtaffe:</hi> and I durſt bee ſworne, ſhe neuer ſo much as dreamte of a Ladiſhip, but fortune (they ſay) is blinde and ſhe alwaies fauours fooles. The Prouerbe may be true, for we haue ſome knights in this age that are not accounted the wiſeſt men, and amongſt them ſhee was Ladyfied, and very ſhortly after that ſhe was numbred in this ſocietie to become a fellow Lady: ſhe began to ſcorne this excrement of wormes, this ſatten, ſilke and veluet were to meane for my Ladies wearing, vnles it were decked, garded and garniſhed with the minerall of golde, ſiluer and other ornaments of more pure and precious nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martial</hi> maketh mention of one of theſe baſe born brats called <hi>Poppeia,</hi> that after ſhee became a concubine to <hi>Nero,</hi> had her horſes ſhod with pure gold: I woulde be aſhamed of it, but I would match <hi>Poppeias</hi> pride with as baſe borne as her ſelfe, if I liſted to picke out preſidents, though not in ſhooing of horſes with gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet in other ſuperfluous vanities, no leſſe nice and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh then that: but let them paſſe, and thus I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that as there is no ambition ſo violent, as that of the Beggers, ſo there is no pride to be compared to the pride of one of theſe abiect creatures, that is exalted &amp; lifted vp from a baſe eſtate to a litle proſperity.</p>
            <p>But now to ſpeake of knights, I ſay that the dignitie was at the beginning giuen for ſeruice in the field, and was proper onely to martiall men, for there was the firſt inſtitution, but ſince it hath growne by cuſtome, that euery abſolute Prince hath power to beſtow that dignity aſwell in the time of peace, as in the time of warre, but yet knights are of the more or leſſe reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the quality of the Prince, or partie
<pb facs="tcp:16373:33"/>
that giueth the creation, for this is the opinion of the Heraldes, the Venetian eſtate, and the ſtate of Genoa, doe take vpon them to make Knights, and ſo doth the Pope; but with theſe wee will not meddle.</p>
            <p>In the time of the firſt inſtitution, the creation was performed with many ceremonies, and as many cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies again were vſed in the degradatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a knight. There are three or foure ſundry orders of knightes in England, but I will onely ſpeake of thoſe that haue neither garment badge, ſigne nor ſhow whereby to be knowne from other ordinary Gentlemen, but by the addition of ſir <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſir <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſir <hi>Richard,</hi> or ſir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> by which notes they are better known amongſt our ſelues then they are to ſtraungers, and theſe knightes are called by the Heraldes, knightes Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelers.</p>
            <p>Theſe knights are made either by the king himſelfe or by his commiſſion and royall authority to his liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, eſpecially in the time of warre, who hath his royal and abſolute power for the inſtant.</p>
            <p>This order is giuen vpon diuerſe conſiderations, whereof the principall is for ſeruice in the field, and to theſe eſpecially belongeth the greateſt honour, and ought to take the firſt place, for I haue knowne, (and I haue ſomtimes ſeen) both Earles &amp; Barons, that haue receiued the order of knighthood in the field, &amp; haue thought themſelues therby to be dignified: for as the beuty of euery common wealth conſiſteth in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Nobility, ſo the wings of true Nobility, wherwith to make her to flie hie, are the deeds of chiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alry, for being inlightened with martial skil, it maketh him to ſhine more cleare and bright.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:16373:33"/>
In the time of Peace, the dignity of knighthood is beſtowed of many worthy Gentlemen, who for their wiſedome and ability euery way, are fit to ſway &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne in the common wealth, and theſe knightes are worthily honored, &amp; are ſo to be reputed &amp; regarded.</p>
            <p>After theſe in the thirde ranke, let them march in Gods name, whom the prince himſelfe doth aduance (perhaps) in hope of their future ſeruice, or for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect or conſideration (whatſoeuer) for it wel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemeth a king to make a knight (thogh it be but for his pleaſur) becauſe a prince may giue him maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to hold his eſtate, as he gaue him Knighthood at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, whither any ſubſtitute may doe the like, I will not diſpute, for if hee makes a Knight for his pleaſure that is vnable, eyther he makes a Begger, that muſt bee ſtill crauing of the Prince, or ſuch a burthen, that of neceſſity, muſt be a peſter to the common wealth, for thoſe knights that are but poore, bare and needy, are like cyphers that do make figures rich, but are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues worth nothing.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry now at laſt to ſpeake of thoſe that are a ſtayne to that honourable order of Knighthood, that knowing themſelues to be of no deſert, nor any waies able to merite, will buy the dignity and purchaſe their knighthood with money, a ſilly humour that loueth admiration, and procureth laughter.</p>
            <p>I haue known of theſe betrayers of vertue, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee had made his purchaſe of a knighthood, the beſt that he was able after to performe, was to take a place at the vpper end of the Table, and all the vertue that was in him beſide, was this, hee loued to pay the Fidlers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16373:34"/>
I might inlarge a great deale of other matter aboute this contending and ſtriuing for places, this ſtanding vpon precedence and ſuperiority, who is better, and who is worſe, but to him that is not partiall, it might very well appeare, that aſwell amongſt Noble men, as amongſt Knights and Gentlemen, the martiall man is firſt to bee preferred, yea amongſt Emperors, kinges and princes, hee is euer holden to bee moſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that is moſt martiall: and this is not mine, but the opinion of the Heraldes.</p>
            <p>Now for a number of counterfeit Souldiers, that wil be called Captaines, ſome of them that neuer had charge, vnles (perhaps) at the fetching home of a May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole, or ſometimes preferred more for fauour then for any ability that was in them, vnles to leade men to the ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>Some other againe that haue beene a littleat the ſea, a pilfering, that for the ſeruice, or what belongeth to the ſea, are more ſimple and ignorant then the poore ſhippe boy, and theſe bee they that are a ſlander and diſgrace to the Art Militari, for there is no greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuility, no baſer diſorder, nor more ſhamefull miſdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor, then is vſed by theſe counterfeit Souldiers that do march vnder the title of Captaines.</p>
            <p>But what profeſſion is free from counterfeites, when Diuinity it ſelfe is ſometimes made but a cloke for hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites: And here if I might but craue a litle li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, I might ſpeake of a kinde and manner of affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is between the Deuine and the Souldier, ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing and concurring ſo nearly together, that both their vertues and their vices might bee ſaide to bee a kinne, and to haue proceeding from one originall:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16373:34"/>
they are both warriours, the one with the word, the other with the ſword: the one fighting againſt the pride of ſinne, and againſt all enemies ghoſtly &amp; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: the other fighting againſt the ambition of Tirants and againſt all other oppreſſors, eyther forreine or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall. A good Captaine muſt haue training, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe and experience, before hee take vppon him to conduct in the ſeruice of his Prince: a godly Deuine muſt haue learning, wiſedome and knowledge, before hee take vpon him the cure of ſoules in the church of God.</p>
            <p>The vnskilfull Captaine but leadeth men to the ſlaughter: the ignorant Deuine leadeth ſoules to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>A good Captaine, fearing the attempts, and ſodaine ſurpriſes of the enemy, is ſtill vigilant and watchfull: A good Deuine fearing the creeping in of vice, &amp; the hote Alarmes of ſinne is euer ready to make reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The Captaine that ſometimes buyeth his company and attaineth to his charge more by fauour of friends then by his owne vertue, is more ready to poul &amp; pill his Souldiers, then to performe any ſeruice; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine that creepeth into a Benefice by ſiniſter practiſe, more for the loue of the liuing, then for loue of the liuing God, will ſooner fleece his flocke then feede it and will bee more ready to contend with his pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners for thoſe duties that are appertaining to himſelf, then to teach and inſtruct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thoſe duties that they owe vnto God. Thoſe Captaines that are too formal and in the preſcribing of martiall Diſcipline, are more nice then neceſſary, are the diſturbers of the loue and amity that ſhould be amongſt Souldiers, and doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:16373:35"/>
times hinder the expedition of ſeruice that might be performed: thoſe Deuines that are more preciſe in the ceremonies of the Church then the worde it ſelfe doth warrant, are the ſeedes men of diſſention, and by their too much curioſity, they ſet abroach thoſe ſtrifes and contentions, that are lets and hindrances to many godly proceedings that might benefite the church.</p>
            <p>The careles Captain ſuffereth his Souldiers to ſpoile to rob, to ſteale, to bring in booties, aſwell from friendes as foes, hee cares not from whome, ſo he may haue his ſhare; the couetous Deuine ſuffereth his flock to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in blindnes, to follow idolatrie, and to rob God of his glory, he cares not how, ſo it bringeth in beeues to his kitchen, horſe to his ſtable, and money to his cofers.</p>
            <p>I might be infinite in this compariſon, but let it reſt: and to conclude (I ſay) they are moſt deteſtable vices, that are moſt deſirous to looke like vertues.</p>
            <p>An Heretique of good life (ſaith <hi>Origen)</hi> is much more hurtfull, and hath more authority in his wordes, then he that doth diſcredit his doctrine with the lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his life, wee muſt therefore take heed of Papiſts that are of godly conuerſation to the ſhow.</p>
            <p>The holy Hipocrite is more to bee feared, then the Publican or Harlot, yet beware of a woman, that hath once marked her ſelfe with infamy, let her afterwardes pretend neuer ſo much honeſty. I dare not vndertake to write an Apology in defence of his wit, that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of gray hayres and wiſedome too, will intangle himſelfe with one of thoſe marked creatures; but ſhe may bring him children, and teach him to ſing with the ſummer bird, <hi>I might haue liued merily, if I had loued neuer.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:16373:35"/>
But to conclude the Text that I haue taken in hand; we contend about precedence and ſuperiority, wee ſtriue who ſhall goe before, and who ſhall follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and wee do all make ſemblance to hunt after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but in truth we hunt contrary, and miſſing the right tract where honour is to bee found, wee content our ſelues with a little vaine glory; but it fitteth the time, and letit doe ſo ſtill, for there is no amendment, the world (I ſee) is growne to be like <hi>Frier Bacons braſen head:</hi> The time is paſt, and there is no hope of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſweateth bloud, whilſt wee ſnort and ſleepe; Chriſt wraſtleth and ftriueth with the world, whilſt we ſtand by, and giue him the looking on; Chriſt hath humbled himſelfe to the Croſſe, wee diſpute of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who ſhall ſit on the right hand, who on the left, who ſhall goe before, and who ſhall follow after: wee are lifted vp in our owne conceites, wee ſwell with pride and preſumption, the one of vs againſt the other, we miſſpend this treaſure of time, which God in his mercy hath giuen vnto vs, this bleſſed ſeaſon of peace, which by a gracious gouernement wee now enjoy, which ſhould bee conuerted to better vſe and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>In the time of peace, Philoſophie hath his peculiar exerciſe: and when wee are exempt from the trouble of warre, it is then time to ſettle religion, to eſtabliſh lawes, and execute iuſtice, to endeuour the knowledge of Artes, and Sciences, and in the time of peace, it is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> high time to prouide for warre.</p>
