            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and Romulus: the citie stode

which trespace by the manlye pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite

of kynges ceased in the Citie of
Rome for euermore, and al the roy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>al
stocke of the forsaide Tarquine
was proscript &amp; put in exile. And
after by the prudent aduise of the
Cenate: the citie was gouerned be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twene
Councellers / and so continu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
vnto the time that Pompei the
proude was repayred home again
from the conquest of Tyre / whych
by force he had made subiecte vnto
the Empyre of Rome, where as w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
great worthines of fame hee was
receiued. So that for his great no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blenes
he was chosen one of the .iii
for to gouerne the city: assigned to
hym other twoo full renowmed of
knighthoode / Iulius Cezar, and
Marcus Crassus, &amp; thus was the
name of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sellers turned into the
<pb facs="tcp:10231:3"/>
name of Dictatours, which was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
time an office partinent to princes
to gouerne other. And for a special
cause this office &amp; this occupacion
of a Dictatour, by assent of all the
whole Cenate was committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thre, that if one offended, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other
twaine should be mightie &amp; strong
to correct the thirde. And another
cause was this: while that twayne
were occupied in warre outward / 
the third should gouerne at home.
And thus al the while they wer of
one hart / of one assent / and void of
variaunce among them selues / the
nobles of Rome floured in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
but as sone as false couetous
brought in pride &amp; vain ambicion,
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tagious Serpent of diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:10231:4"/>
And so for the surquedous pride on
the partie of Iulius, and after of
the said citie of Rome: the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
couetous entermedled wyth

made the famous citie of Rome ful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye

them also to be ful baren and de

finallye, the false diuision amonge
them selues, was more importable
vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and caunsed more the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine

aforesaid whiche Iulius required
and asked of righte as for a gwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
which him thought was meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
and due vnto him. Anone this
foresaide Pompey with full assent
<pb facs="tcp:10231:11"/>
of all the Cenate, denyed all with
one voyce his request, and of one
accord answered againe, and sayd
him platlie he should not be accep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
there vnto no such honour / but
plainlie they bad him know that he
had rather deserued to be deade,
then to attain to any such worship,
aledging against him that he was
both rebel and traytour to the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of Rome. And whan Iulius
clerely conceiued the short answer
of the Cenate and of this Pompey
to fore sayde, there kyndled a full
great hote burning fire of enuy in
his hart of the freting hate, special<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,
that he bare in his breast for to
be reuenged of Pompey. And as
Lucan rehearseth in his poeticall
booke, the denyeng of this worship
to Iulius, was the chiefe grounde
and occasion of all the warre that
began in Rome / roote and begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:10231:12"/>
also of al the contagious diu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

among them selfes. But so as
Lucan liketh to reherce and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
in his booke aforesaide among
other causes that he put. Lye in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special
writeth of three which were
chiefe beginning and roote of diui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion
among them selues / prouing
by reason in those thre that it must
needes be that the felicitie and the
prosperitie of Rome must abate &amp;
draw to decline. The which three,
firste hee saythe it was necessarye
that such aduersitie shoulde fall to
Rome. Secondarelye he saithe it
was consue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>udinarie. And thirdly
he saith it was voluntarie. Fyrst
that it was necessarye, hee proueth
by example of nature in this wyse:
That like as Phebus the sunne / 
when he ariseth in the Orient / and
by successiue course ascendeth into

               </gap>lye there is

first cause is natural and necessary
and that all worldlye pompe and
pride shall passe, mine Auctor Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
hath proued by reason. Than
as touching the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cause which

third cause of destruccion of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie / 
Lucan liketh to call it in his po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>etical
muses, voluntarie, which is
as much to saye, as a cause rooted
vpon wilfulnes without ani grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

wilfulnes they were so blinde: that
them list not to know them selues /

not by no collateral occasion of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie

thereof. And thus throughe false
surquedraunce they were made so
wilful, that none list to obey other.
And so was brought in obstinacie
euerich of them deming hym selfe
egall to other. And thus of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
discorde among them selfes
onely of voluntari they stode disse<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uered
<pb facs="tcp:10231:14"/>
and deuided / which was one

And in presence of all the Cenate

bring foorth an horsse which had a

he plucked to the vttermost of hys

than anon this Philosopher made
call to the presence of the Cenate / 
the most impotent man of the citie,
a man vnweldye and crooked of
age. And thys Philosopher made
this old man to pluck the one here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>after
an other of the hors taile, tyll
by litle and litle by proces the tayl
was wasted cleane awaye, and the

with other (vndeuided) the mighti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>est

of power among ye all / lefte neuer
tyll the tayle was consumed and

brought to nought. By whiche ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
said the Philosopher, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
aduert &amp; wisely cast tofore,
that as longe as ye be one in your
selues / &amp; of one hart / there is none
so strong nor so mightie that may
auail by force to attempt your wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thines.
But as sone as amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g your

And in especiall there appeared a

Pompey for feare was fledde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the parties of Grece to make
himself strong: Thei of Rome had
shortly determined in se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence that
Iulius not enter the Citye, but so
were that his whole retinue were
left behinde. But when they knew
<pb facs="tcp:10231:23"/>
and saw him so passingly mightye
and strong: they began to quaken
in theyr hartes, and namely: when
they were destitute of an head. Of
which and for that, some Dukes of
Pompey drew them to the parties
of Italy into a city which whylom
was called Dirachium. And euer
thys woorthy knight Iulius wyth
his chiualry pursued after, and all
that wythstoode he slewe / and the
remnaunt he put manly to flyght.
And day by day the power of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
gan multiplye and encrease / 
and mauger al his enemies of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
force he entred the citye. And as
some auctours write / whan the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maines
(for dread) were readye to
receiue him by theyr gates: he of
indignacion and disdayne / made
breake the walles, and proudly en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tred
as a Conquerour, and iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Romaynes as his, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:10231:24"/>
tooke on hym the gouernaunce / 
not onely of the citie / but of all the
whole Empyre. And maugre the
Cenate he brake the brason doore
of their treasure, and by violence
toke and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aught it away, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouslye
departed it amonge hys
knights. And in this meane while
ful many kinges of the East party
of the worlde, came and assembled
before the foresaid city called Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachium.
Of entent to sustaine the
party of Pompey against Iulius.
And as soone as there was made
relacion to Iulius Cezar of thys
great assemble: he made no delay / 
but with all his power passed by a
countrey which of mine authour is
called Epirum, and so he entred in
to the costes of Thessalie / wher as
he founde Pompey / batayled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste
hym wyth foure score Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortes
and eight, departed into .iii

There were also on the partye of
Pompey, fortie thousande of foote

and drowned. And Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome
the kinge / as he woulde haue
fled out of a ship (for haste) he fel in
to the sea and was drowned. And
as his bodye was cast to lande / he
was knowen and discouered by a
gile haberion, the which haberion
Iulius Cezar made to be sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the citie of Alizandre / for dread
of which they of Alizandre yelded
the citie vnto him. Than he repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
againe into Egipt / and by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the death of Tholome he
gaue the Septer and the Realme
and the whole gouernaunce of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt
vnto the Queene Cleopatra.
And so after the conquest of manye
other Prouincies, Regions / and
landes, he made his repaire again
the seconde time vnto the Citye of
Rome / and there he did take vpon
him two offices, both of Consull &amp;
of Dictatour. And from thence he
<pb facs="tcp:10231:26"/>
went vnto the conquest of Affcike
and there began a new warre, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special
against al the aliaunce and
the blood of Pompey, and slew all
the Dukes that were enclined to
be fauourable to the partie of Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,
among which were slaine thre
mightie princes, Faustus / Cilla / &amp;
Postumus, &amp; Pompeia, the dough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
of Pompey iudged to be dead.
And from those parties he entred
with a mightie and strong hand in
to Spayne / and there (so as Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonins
writeth) he tooke vpon him
power to receiue the tribute, which
on the partie of Spayne was due
vnto Rome. And so as thys storye
maketh mencion / he proceeded so

               </gap>e in his conquest, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he came

               </gap>s, and there
he entered into the Temple of the
stronge mightie champion called
Hercu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es. And whan he beheld in
<pb facs="tcp:10231:26"/>
the same Temple a riche image of
gold / set vp for a memorie of kyng
Alizaundre: anon this Cezar gan
to sigh and complayne in his selfe
that he neuer might attayne in his
conquest to deserue so victorious
a Palme of worthines as in theyr
tyme dyd Alisaunder and Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.
And thus pensible and heauye
(he issuing oute of the Temple of
Hercules) fullye purposed hym in
his courage, knightly to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him of manly courage, some newe
enterprises of hygh prowesse. And
whiles that he was thus surprised

And they anon concluded in shorte

in their exposicion / that
the earth is primordinall mother
of al thing / concluding therby that
he should attaine to be Lorde and
Emperour ouer all the parties of

the mighty conquest of Affrike / he
repaired the third time to Rome,
and was made Emperour ouer al

For as the story maketh men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion /

And for to rehearce compendious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the prodigies and the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

It is reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred that the same yere

dayes before hys pyteous
murder in the large Market place
of Rome / where as the stature and

most clere and styl, with a sodayne
stroke of the firie leuen / the fyrste
letter of his name .C. was smyten
away. Declaring by this pronosti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cal
signe, that like as this letter C
in nombre betokeneth an hundred / 
&amp; was also most craftely wrought
and grauen as for the chief capital
letter of his name, to shew openly
that the rasing away of this letter
by violence of the firye leuen: that
he that was head of all the earthe,
within the space of a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred daies
next ensuing, should be vengeabli
murdred in Rome. Also the same
day of his murdre as he went most
royally in his Imperiall araye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Consistorie, a poore man
named Tong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for hee was negligent to reade the
letters, and to vnclose them, the ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geable
murder was execute vpon
hym. By which example let no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
be slow nor negligent to reade his
letters, lest after for his neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
it may turne him to great damage
which after may not lightly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered.
And the chiefe cause and
worker of this murder / was Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Crassus / associed vnto him .ii.
hundred and syxty of the Cenate,
al hauing bodkins in theyr sleues.
And as it is in storye remembred,
he had .xxiiii. deadly woundes as
he sat in the Capitole, and as saith
mine aucthour / he neuer in all hys
smarte / made neyther crye nor no
noyse / except onelye a lamentable
and a dolorous sigh, like a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that

<pb facs="tcp:10231:30"/>
So that touchinge the vengeable
maner of hys pyteous murder I
maye conclude with him that was

Dame Fortune, spareth neyther

neuer man lyft to lift vp his harts

damages, and the importable har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of diuision, and let them se ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly,
and take example how the
ambicous pride of Iulius, the fre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinge

vnstaunchable gredye couetise of
Marcus Crassus, were chiefe and
primordial cause of their destrucci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on,
