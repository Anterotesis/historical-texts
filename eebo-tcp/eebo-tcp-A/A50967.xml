            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <salute>SIR,</salute>
            <p>I Am beholding to you for Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reaſons you alledg for your refuſal to Read His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties <hi>Declaration</hi> in your Church; for by them I diſcern, that he who writ the firſt Letter to a <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he told us you were convinc'd of your Error, in being Severe towards us, and that we had not now to do with thoſe Rigid Prelates, who made it a matter of Conſcience to give us the leaſt Indulgence, writ this of his own Head, without any Authority from you; but that He, or They who writ a Treatiſe, which was Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little before the Kings <hi>Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Entituled, <hi>The Vanity of all preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for Toleration,</hi> (wherein the Queſtion is put and Anſwered, <hi>Shall we give up the Cauſe, and ſubſcribe to a Toleration? Nothing leſs, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in our Circumſtances, it is not only contrary to Religion and Civil Prudence, but alſo to Charity and Compaſſion</hi>) were guided in this matter by the ſame temper of Mind, with that which is diſcovered in your reaſonings, which are as like one to the other as Face is to Face in a Glaſs; for therein the Author, who is your Advocate, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96454:2"/>
without doubt had both your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Aſſiſtance, tells us, That <hi>the practice of puniſhing Diſſenters is contrary neither to the Doctrine or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Chriſt, and therefore He hopes, they that uſe it upon great occaſion may be diſcharged of the odious Imputation of Antichriſt;</hi> and that <hi>Experience hath taught us, that Compulſion in matters of Religion ſerves many times to render Men more Teachable, and willing to be Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> And beſides all this, That <hi>a ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and diſcreet Execution of the Laws againſt Diſſenters, might happily have been a much more merciful Conduct, even with reſpect to them, then that R<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>niſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Connivance which tempted them to preſumptuous Sins.</hi> One touch he hath alſo at the Kings Prerogative, not like to your preſent reaſoning, which calls it into Queſtion, but by way of Allowance and Commendation; for he ſays, <hi>We owe it only to the Wiſdom and Foreſight of His late Majeſty, that ſome of the moſt conſiderable Laws are now in being, I mean that of</hi> 35 <hi>Q. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, which He ſaved by His Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, as well as Men, when it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be Aboliſhed, and if His Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency had ſaved many, who the Laws had juſtly Condemmed, Why ſhould it not ſave a Law that had done Him and His Anceſtors no ſmall Service, and was then doom'd to an undeſerved Fate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I intend not to enter upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this your Advocate Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, which is ſufficiently refelled and rebuked by His Majeſties <hi>Royal Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Indulgence;</hi> but to ſhew you, until you give a better Evidence to the contrary, then hitherto you have done, how the Diſſenters are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret <hi>Your Charity, Your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion, Your Mercy, Your Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,</hi> and <hi>Your due tenderneſs towards them, when you have an opportunity of ſhewing your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations without danger:</hi> But I paſs from this to what I intend, and that is to make a brief enquiry into the weight of your Reaſons, which I ſuppoſe, you therefore make Publick, that they might be well conſider'd &amp; ſcann'd, in order thereto I have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiallity, or injury to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſence, not Literally Tranſcribed but Extracted the ſubſtance of them.</p>
            <p>That which hath principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to this, is, becauſe I think you either do not your ſelf underſtand the ſubſtance of the Kings <hi>Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or elſe by your not Reading it, and Miſ-repreſenting it, you ſeem unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that it ſhould be underſtood by any others: For thus you begin.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>To take away the</hi> Teſt <hi>and</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws <hi>at this time is but one step from the introducing of</hi> Popery, <hi>and therefore to read ſuch a Declaration in our Churches, though it do not immediately bring</hi> Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>in, <hi>Yet it ſets open our Church Doors for it, and then it will take its own time to enter.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a far fetch'd Inference; How would you be underſtood? Suppoſe it granted for Argument ſake, that to take away the <hi>Teſt</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws</hi> is but one ſtep from the introducing of <hi>Popery;</hi> Is your Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Declaration</hi> a nearer ſtep to the introducing of <hi>Popery</hi> then ſuch a Repeal? If you ſhould Read it, will that open your Church Doors ſo
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96454:2"/>
wide that <hi>Popery</hi> may enter without any more to do, though the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſt</hi> ſhould not be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? I take the true and genuine ſenſe of the Kings Declaration to be <hi>a ſetting open your Church Doors that Papiſts and Diſſenters, who have no mind to be there, may not be Compelled by Temporal Penalties to come in, and abide there, whether they will or no;</hi> For you have hitherto opened your Church Doors, that you may drive them in, and in force of <hi>Penal Laws</hi> to keep them there in Spiritual Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage againſt their Wills; and if they have at any time, for above theſe Hundred Years, adventured to ſtart out of your Churches to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from this ſort of Bondage, you by your Excommunication proſecuted them into Corporal Bondage without Redemption: Its accounted an ill Omen to ſtumble at the Threſhold, but this you have done <hi>by calling that an opening your Doors to let</hi> Popery <hi>in, which is intended only to let</hi> Papiſts <hi>and</hi> Diſſenters <hi>out, and to leave you with all that are of the Religion Eſtabliſhed by Law in the full and peaceable Poſſeſſion of your Churches, and to enjoy them with Security to Perpetuity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. You ſay, <hi>Should we comply with this Order all good Proteſtants would Deſpiſe and Hate us, and then we may be eaſily Cruſh'd, &amp; may ſoon fall without any Pity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In reaſoning thus, you are either very Cenſorious and Uncharitable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all Diſſenters, or elſe you great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtake their Temper; For your reaſoning herein can conclude no leſs, then, either that there is not one good Proteſtant among all the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or elſe, if there be any ſuch, that they would Diſpiſe and Hate you for doing of that which is their Intereſt to do themſelves, and to have done by all Men, and by you in particular, <hi>that the Juſtice, Reaſon and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency which the King has mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in His Gracious Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be known and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all:</hi> If any other good Proteſtants ſhould Deſpiſe and Hate you for it, for which they have no cauſe, yet you do not ſuppoſe, that they are the Men that would Cruſh you; and for the Diſſenters, though you Miſ-repreſent them in the Cloſe of your Letter, yet herein I would do them this right, to rid you of your groundleſs Fears; You may be aſſured that for your Reading &amp; Purſuing the intent of the Kings Declaration which Tends both to your and their Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Equity and Law, they will not Cruſh you, for thereby they will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to be Cruſh'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with you; ſo that I ſee no cauſe for your Fears, either of Diſhonour or Downſal, unleſs you reſolve to throw your ſelves down, and pu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> down the Diſſenters alſo to veriſie your ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Prognoſtications.</p>
            <p n="3">III. You ſay, <hi>We fall a little ſooner for not Reading the</hi> Declaration, <hi>If our Gracious Prince reſent this as an Act of an Obſtinate, Peeviſh or Factious Diſobedience (as our Enemies will be ſure to repreſent it to Him) we ſhall as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96454:3"/>
               <hi>fall, and not long after if we do read it, and then we ſhall fall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npitied and Deſpiſed, and it may be with the Curſes of the Nation, whom we have ruined by our Compliance, and this is the way never to riſe more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not Reckon my ſelf to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Number of your Enemies, and therefore, though you are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Peeviſh, I would not that you ſhould be repreſented to the King as Obſtinate: For my Hopes are, that upon better Conſideration you will ſhew your ſelves Obedient to his Commands; But if it ſhould prove otherwiſe, as your Enemies will not, ſo your Friends cannot Excuſe you, as being altogether Free from Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, But how comes it to paſs that you being a Miniſter of the Goſpel ſhould fix your Eye ſo ſteadity upon the Diſhonour being Unpitied and Deſpiſed, as inſeparable Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of a Certain Fall not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have read the Kings Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, if you Comply to Read it? A ſettled Apprehenſion that you ſhall certainly Fall, whether you Read or not Read, is ſufficient to Diſturb your Fancy, ſo as to Interrupt the making of a Solid Judgment in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to your Duty, and Diſcharge of a good Conſcience towards God: There is as little need, as there is Juſt Occaſion for you to Surmize, as you do, that your Complyance will Ruin the Nation, and procure their Curſes; for I cannot ſee any ſuch moral certainty attending your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Ruining the Nation: Thoſe other Incredients might have been p<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>termitted, if you have no Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, by diſcovering your ſeeming Fears, to ſtir up a real fear in the minds of others. I think it more nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you, ſetting aſide all thoughts of Honour and Diſhonour, good Report or bad Report, to ſee to it that you have the Law of God on your ſide, to excuſe your Diſobedience to the King; for otherwiſe the ill Conſequences of contending with Soveraign Power, and inticing others to do the like after your example will lye heavy upon you. For tho you Mention onely your own Fall, yet you intimate plainly enough, that you are not to Fall alone, and never to Riſe more, but that this will be the Fate of all the Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Chruches alſo, and therefore you proceed after that Manner.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>May I Suffer all that can be Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd in this World, rather than to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the final Ruin of the best Church in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it ſeemes if you Fall, the beſt Church in the World muſt Fall alſo, and that not partially, or for a ſeaſon, but Totally and Finally. Do you not Attribute too much to your ſelf in this? Are you the only Pillar upon which the beſt Church in the World is Built? And are <hi>Penal Laws</hi> the onely ſtrength by which you Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Church? If thoſe you will have in this point to be accounted, your Adverſaries, ſhould prevail (as once you know they did do, for Twenty Years together) to Diveſt you of your Coercive Power, your Experience may Dictate to you; that a <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> here, as well as elſe where has ſubſiſted, and may Subſiſt through Divine Aſſiſtance, when that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96454:3"/>
coercive Power is taken out of your Hands: However I acknowledg no Man can juſtifie himſelf for contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the Ruin of any true Church; but in this you are not ſingular, as you would make your ſelves to be; the <hi>Diſſenter</hi> may claim Equally with your ſelves a ſhare in ſuch a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this, and ſay as you do; may I Suffer ſtill, as I have Suffered all that you have Inflicted upon me, or what elſe the Providence of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots for my Portion; rather then that I ſhould contribute to the Ruin of the beſt, or any Church of Chriſt in the World.</p>
            <p n="5">V. You ſay, <hi>I ſuppoſe no Miniſter of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>can give his conſent to the</hi> Declaration, <hi>and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> Declaration <hi>in our Churches, will be with great Reaſon interpreted a Conſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You might have taken caution from your own Poſtſcript to your Reaſons, concerning <hi>Henry Care,</hi> not to have made your Suppoſition, ſo Univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comprehenſive of every Miniſter of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> in regard you ſay, Reading is Teaching, and ſignifies Conſent to the matter Read; and you Inſtance in Four or Five which did Read, and I think I may more probably ſuppoſe, that if any preciſe Diſquiſition ſhould happen to be made, many of your Miniſters who did not Read, may chuſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves, rather by their not receiving Directions from their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnary to Read, then to alledge as you do, that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">VII. You ſay, <hi>Our Law ſuppoſes, that what we do in Obedience to Superiours, we make our own Act by doing it: This is the onely Reaſon I know, why we muſt not obey a</hi> Prince <hi>againſt the Laws of the Land, or the Laws of God; becauſe what we do, let the Authority be what it will that Commandt it, becomes our own Act, and we are Reſponſible for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you State this as a general Caſe of every Subject, I ſuppoſe you miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Law, for I cannot conceive how a Clerk in <hi>Parliament, Privy Council, Court of Juſtice, or Convocation</hi> who Writes, and afterwards Reads openly what his Superiours have Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and Commanded him to Read ſhould be ſuppoſed in the Eye of the Law, to be his own Act: If you mean by your Laws, you being Miniſters are Reſponſible for what you do in any other Manner, then the reſt of the Kings Subjects, or Miniſterial Officers are, you ſhould have done well to have ſhewed it,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96454:4"/>
for till that be done I know not how to Diſtinguiſh of your Caſe as Different from other Miniſterial Clerks.</p>
            <p>The onely Reaſon you alledge, why you muſt not obey a Prince againſt the Law of the Land or the Laws of God, is both Complicated, and Equivocal; For if you willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walk after any Command, which is contrary to the Law of God, let the Authority be as you ſay what it will, that Commands it, whether of a Prince ſingly, or a Prince in conjunction with a Parliament; I grant, that it becomes your own Act, for which you are reſponſible to God; But it is not ſo in many Caſes, where a Prince may Command to Do, or forbear, what a particular Statute for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids or appoints, Becauſe He may therein Exerciſe His Prerogative according to the Common Law.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if you being a Miniſter ſhould obey the Kings, and your Lawful Superiours Order, and Read his Declaration, by which ſome Penal Laws are ſuſpended, and this Act of Prerogative ſhould afterwards come to be Queſtioned in Parliament to whom are you Reſponſible?

            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Miniſters are bound to take care that what they Publiſh in their Churches, be neither contrary to the Laws of the Land, nor the good of the Church.

            <p>I take it for granted that you have ſufficiently demonſtrated to all Men, that Reading and not Preaching off Book, is Teaching, for that has been your ordinary Practice for many Years, and it is true, by Reading you Teach your People to underſtand what you Read, but when that is done, your People are at liberty to judge, and you alſo in this Preſent Caſe being ordered to read what the King hath declared, are at liberty to Pen a Sermon that may be a Paraphraſe upon what you read before, and read that in your Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit afterwards, ſo as therein you do not tranſgreſs the Law of God, or of the Land, and by that your People may underſtand whether you conſent to, or diſſent from what you have read, and if your are commanded by Law to read what you do not conſent

to in your own Conſcience, and for the diſcharge of a good Conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, let your People know ſo much; I think you therein diſcharge both the Office of a Miniſter to Man, and Duty of a Teacher to God; and in ſuch a Caſe, tho you ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be judged by Mans Law, yet you may with a quiet Mind, therein commend your Cauſe to God, who judgeth righteouſly.</p>
            <p>Be it ſo, That Miniſters are not look'd upon as common Cryers, yet give me leave to ſay, you being Miniſters are look'd upon as publick Preachers, or Heralds to publiſh the Orders of your Superiors, and are no more accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any Man for the matter which you ſo publiſh, then a Herald who Publiſhes the Kings Proclamation to his Subjects; con<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Moſt certainly, if the Kings Heart were not well Aſſured of the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Clemency</hi> towards all His Subjects in what He has Declared, It would be the moſt Impolitick Action imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Him to command, that it ſhould be Publiſhed, and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to all of them, in the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner, when they are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from all Secular Diverſions, and have their Minds moſt Free, and Intent upon the Matter that is read to them: His Majeſty Declares the Reaſon why He would have it thus Publiſhed, <hi>Viz. <hi>That they may Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and Reap the Benefit of that General Good, which He deſigns for the whole Kingdom; That His chief Aim has been, not to be the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, but the Father of His People, That they may lay aſide all Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and groundleſs Jealouſies, and Chooſe ſuch Members of Parliament, as may do their part to Finiſh what He has Begun, for the Advantage of the Monarchy, over which Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God hath placed Him.</hi>
               </hi> Now, if the Matter of the Declaration would not bear the moſt exact Scrutiny, and Recommend it ſelf to the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Underſtanding of all His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: Can any Man rationally think, that this was a probable way for His Majeſty to Effect the End He propoſed therein? But ſince you put me upon Poſſibilities, I think it may poſſibly be, and very probably alſo, as I Gather from your Reaſonings, that you do what lyes in you, to <hi>Conceal</hi> from your People, the Matter of the Declaration, leaſt your People would Approve it, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Promote it.</p>
            <p>But though you are thus Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to <hi>Conceal</hi> the Declaration, Why do you not tell us what your <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> are, for in this, you are as Dark as in all the reſt? I muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, if I had no other means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the Declaration contains, nor what your Principles are, than by what you have ſaid in your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning them, you deal ſo much in Generals, that I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be Able to Underſtand either of them, nor wherein the One is againſt the Other.</p>
            <p>But now let us come to the main Point, for in compariſon of that, All the Reſt is of little value.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>For you to Conſent to Teach your People ſuch Doctrines as you think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of God, or the Laws of the Land, does not leſſen, but aggravate the Fault.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have, in your Letter, made mention of an old Maxim, <hi>The King</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:96454:7"/>
               <hi>can do no Wrong, <hi>And therefore if any Wrong be done, the Crime, and Guilt is the Miniſters, who does it: Nor is any Miniſter, who does an Illegal Action, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to pretend the Kings Commiſſion, and Authority for it.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>You cannot Forget who They were that before you Inſiſted upon this ſort of Argument, nor how ſeverely you of all Men have in your Pulpits and Prints, handled them for it; But now you think it may ſerve your Turn, you Revive it again.</p>
            <p>Since therefore you make it no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Conſcience</hi> in this <hi>Caſe,</hi> to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſuch Things now, as you <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi> heretofore; Why ſhould you not do it in ſome other <hi>Caſes</hi> alſo?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as oft as they were Summoned into your <hi>Courts,</hi> or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, for their <hi>Nonconformity</hi> to your Modes of Worſhip, or for Aſſembling to Worſhip in other manner, Pleaded ſimply, They could not Do the One, nor Forbear the Other; becauſe in doing the firſt, or forbearing the laſt, They ſhould Sin againſt their <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and Tranſgreſs the Law of their Lord; whatever your Laws, or the Laws of the Land commanded, or prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: This Plea was uſually Termed a meer pretence, and their Aſſemblies Cenſured by their Secular Judges, as <hi>Riots, Routs, Seditious</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies;</hi> and by your Judges they were Condemned, as Obſtinate and Contumacious; and upon theſe Scores they ſuffered the Penalties inflicted: Now, though you did Publiſh, and cauſe to be Executed, ſuch Sentences heretofore againſt the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who made uſe of this Plea, as a <hi>Pure mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Conſcience, with reſpect to God's Law;</hi> this may be no Bar, as appears by your former inſtance, but that you may take up the ſame ſimple Honeſt Plea at this time, if you are, as they were, ſincere therein, and make it for your ſelves now, as they did then; And by this way you may, without Intangling your ſelves by determining poſitively Doubtful Points of Law (which is not your Province) come to a fair Iſſue in that, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Charge of your Function as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; for the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> agree with you in this Principle, that <hi>For any Man to Conſent to Teach others ſuch Doctrines as he thinks contrary to the Laws of God, is a great Fault:</hi> Let the Matter of the <hi>Declaration</hi> therefore be fairly Diſcuſſed between you and us, with that Modeſty, which becomes <hi>Subjests:</hi> Many <hi>Diſſenters</hi> differ from you in their Thoughts in this point; They think <hi>The King's Declaration is not contrary to the law of God; and that therefore it may lawfully be Read;</hi> If any of them queſtion any part of it, It is that wherein the King promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to <hi>Protect</hi> and <hi>Maintain</hi> the <hi>Arch-Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as <hi>Lord Biſhops,</hi> of which they find no Footſteps in the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> but if they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the Dignity of Barons is only an Addition to that of a Biſhop, and does neither Alter, Enlarge, or Abrogate the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Office; but is an Honour conferr'd upon them by the Civil <hi>Sovereign Power:</hi> There is no Reaſon for any <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> or any other of the <hi>King's</hi> Subjects, to make this a ſcruple of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> in regard it proceeds from a <hi>Civil Conſtitution,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:96454:7"/>
and is a Law of Mans Creation, to which, among others of like nature, every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is to ſubmit for the <hi>Lord</hi>'s ſake: And that you and I may as well Agree in our Thoughts about the Subject in hand, as in the <hi>Principle</hi> I have mention'd: Its neceſſary that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what it is that His Majeſty has Declared; I ſhall repeat that Point, upon which many others Depend, as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conſequence, as that to which I think you take the greateſt Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The KING declares, that <hi>It hath been His conſtant Senſe and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that Conſcience ought not to be conſtrained; nor People Forced in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of meer Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now its incumbent on you to ſhew wherein you think this Point is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Laws of <hi>GOD,</hi> and that you do it, is but a reaſonable Requeſt, for elſe you perform not your Function to your people, but will lye under the ſuſpition of <hi>Teaching for Doctrines, the Commands of Men,</hi> which you know our <hi>Lord</hi> ſharply Reproves in thoſe that exerciſe the Function of Teachers.</p>
            <p>Till you have done this, and made it plain, you have no Reaſon to Carp at any Thing that is naturally ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, as the ſuſpending ſuch <hi>Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> by which many of His Subjects are co-erced to Worſhip contrary to their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> or pardoning Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt ſuch Laws, <hi>For this is a natural Exerciſe of His Prerogative, as God's Vicegerent in Acts of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Clemency;</hi> It can be no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to GOD, that the Execution of ſuch Laws be neglected by the King's Miniſters, or Suſpended by Himſelf, till they can be Repealed by <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which ought never to have been made, and could never be obeyed, without Tranſgreſſing the Law of <hi>GOD:</hi> The King's lawful, proper, and neceſſary Prerogative, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for all Exigents, wherein there is no proviſion made by a particular Law, and to ſuſpend ſuch particular Statutes, as were from the Beginning, or in proceſs of time, prove uſeleſs, or burthenſom to a multitude of His Subjects, and <hi>Wherein no particular Subject is injured, as to any Right, or Priviledge, which he can claim by Law:</hi> ſo that till you have performed your Task, and ſhewed that this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which the Declaration Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is againſt the Law of God, and what Branch of the Divine Law it is againſt, that the Penalties whereby Men are compelled to Worſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> ſhould be ſuſpended: No more need to be ſaid to this, taking it ſingly, as it is a Matter of pure <hi>Conſcience,</hi> ſuppoſed by you to be an Offence againſt the Law of God.</p>
            <p>But I conſider how you ſtate it with a double Aſpect, having an Eye both to the Laws of God, and to the Laws of the Land, and that not conjunctive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but disjunctively: <hi>It is an Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Fault with you to Conſent to Teach your People ſuch Doctrines as you think contrary to the Laws of God, or the Laws of the Land,</hi> that ſo you may have a double ſtring to your Bow: If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove the Doctrine of the Kings <hi>Declaration</hi> to be contrary to the Laws of God, yet you cannot conſent to Teach it your People, becauſe you think it is contrary to the Laws of the Land: nevertheleſs taking your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96454:8"/>
to be conſiſtent with it ſelf, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before ſhewed, you did not Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the Matter of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> I cannot ſuppoſe you made mention of the Laws of God ſuperfluouſly, or vainly, and therefore it remains as a Charge upon you to declare plainly, Whether you think it contrary to the Laws of God, or not: And having Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated this, that you may take the more Notice of it, I'le paſs to the next Branch, and that is for you to ſhew, wherein it is contrary to the Law of the Land; the Reaſons for this I ſhall give you in my Remarks upon your next Paragraph.</p>
            <p n="11">Eleventhly, Say you, <hi>It is to Teach an unlimited, and univerſal Toleration, which the Parliament in 1672. declared Illegal, and which has been Condemned by the Chriſtian Church in all Ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is to Teach my People, that they need never come to Church more, but have my Free Leave, as they have the Kings, to go to a Conventicle, or to Maſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is to Teach the Diſpenſing Power, which Alters what has been formerly thought the whole Conſtitution of this Church, and Kingdom, which we dare not Do, till we have the Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us conſider what part of the King's <hi>Declaration</hi> may be ſuppoſed by you to do the Things here Alledged, and whether, what you are required to do, be as to the Matter of it, of any other Nature, than what has hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been Approved by Authority of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſty, after the ſuſpention of all <hi>Penal Laws</hi> in matters Eccleſiaſtical, for not coming to Church, or not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nonconformity to the Religion Eſtabliſhed, or for, or by reaſon of the Exerciſe of Religion in any manner whatſoever, is pleaſed to Declare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what Terms, and in what Manner All His Loving Subjects have <hi>Free leave to Meet, and Serve God after their own Way, and Manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I muſt pray you to Interpret what you mean by an Unlimited, and Univerſal <hi>Toleration,</hi> for you are ſtill in Generals, Is it ſuch an Unlimited, and Univerſal <hi>Toleration,</hi> as gives all Men Liberty to Meet in ſuch manner, and to do, and ſay as they pleaſe: There ſeems to me many Reſtrictions in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> the Meeting muſt be <hi>For the Exerciſe of Religion,</hi> and not Irreligion, and though All may Meet, and Serve in their Own Way, yet <hi>It is to Serve God,</hi> and not an Idol.</p>
            <p>For my part, if I had no Fear of God before me, yet I ſhould very much fear ſevere Corporal puniſhment from the Hands of the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> if I ſhould Meet, and openly preach Blaſphemy, Idolatry, or any other Doctrine of immortality, againſt the Light, and Law of Nature given to, and inſcribed on the Heart of every Man; For tho' the King is pleaſed to ſay, <hi>I ſhall not be compelled to perform any Act of Worſhip contrary to my Conſcience,</hi> I am nevertheleſs Accomptable for all Things that I openly and voluntarily, without any compulſion do, or ſay, which fall under the Cognizance of the Civil Magiſtrate, as all things do, which are againſt the Reaſon of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and common Light and Law of Nature; and tho' there ſhould be no

Statute Law in the Caſe, <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Law of the Land is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Law of Nature, and no way ſuſpended by the King's Declaration,</hi> and by this, open Scandals againſt the Light of Nature are Puniſhable by the Civil Judges.</p>
            <p>But you ſay, <hi>an unlimited, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Toleration the Parliament in 1672 declared Illegall;</hi> It may be ſo, but I doe not know it; I have ſeen no Copy of any Law, or Ordinance of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment applicable to the point in hand: If you Intend to prove the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Declaration,</hi> was declared to be Illegall by the Parliament in 1672, you muſt mend your Common Fault of Dealing in General, For it is all one, and no more a Proof of any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Declared</hi> Illegal in a Parliament, to Quote onely the year, without repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Words of the Law, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter of the <hi>Declaration</hi> to it, then if you had ſaid it of your Own Head, or mention'd for a proof of your Aſſertion, a Vote of the Houſe of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> which was Publiſhed by Order of their <hi>Speaker, Jan:</hi> 10. 1680, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>it was reſolved to be the Opinion of that Houſe, That the Proſecution of Proteſtant Diſſenters upon the Penal Laws, was at that time Grievous to the Subject, a Weakening of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Intereſt, an Encouragement to Popery, and Dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your next Aſſertion is, <hi>That an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited and univerſal Toleration has been Condemned by the Chriſtian Churches in All Ages;</hi> If you mean by this, that the Chriſtian Churches in All Ages did Aſſume to themſelves a Power of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Juriſdiction over all men that were <hi>without the Church,</hi> or that the Church in all Ages did by <hi>Temporal Penalties</hi> conſtrain men to come into the Church, or when they were there, <hi>to Worſhip contrary to their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> or to Abide there, when they had no Heart to do ſo, but would For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Faith, their Profeſſion, or their Chriſtian Doctrine, and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and alſo their Aſſemblys: I think you are very much miſtaken in the Chriſtian Doctrine and Practiſe of the Churches in the primitive Ages: Surely I may ſay in this, as in the Reſt, Shew me an <hi>Apoſtolical Authority</hi> for ſuch a Practiſe; And I have ſo much the more Reaſon to inſiſt upon this, Becauſe Chriſts Diſciples in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Age, were <hi>All Volunteers,</hi> Suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Doctrine which Our Lord, and his Apoſtles Taught, Repentance from Dead Works, and Faith in the Son of God, which are Convictions, and Operations upon the Mind of Man, and neceſſary Qualifications to the being of a True Chriſtian, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of them to the being of a Viſible Chriſtian, and the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Self-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> to his Continuance in his Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; The <hi>Doctrine</hi> is plain, <hi>Whoſoever Will, let him take of the Water of life Freely, You will not Come to me that you may have life;</hi> and when many of thoſe, who for ſome time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be our Lords <hi>Diſciples</hi> went back, and Walked no more with him, That which was the Ground of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perſeverance was, that with him were the words of Eternal Life, and that they Believed, and knew that He was the Chriſt, the Son of the Living God, and that therefore there was none Elſe to whom they could Go;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96454:9"/>
The Apoſtle Foretels us, That in the Latter Times, ſome would Depart from the Faith, Giving heed to ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Spirits,</hi> and Doctrines of Devils; That there would be M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ckers Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their own Ungodly Luſts; that ſuch They were, who being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, and having not the <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves, and the Apoſtle John ſays Expreſsly, that in his day there were <hi>Many Antichriſts,</hi> who went out from us (that is from the Apoſtles, and Churches) but they were not of us; For if they had been of us, they would have Remained with us, But <hi>They went out, that it might be made Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, they were not All of us:</hi> And this the Apoſtle makes as the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtical Note, by which he Knew it was the Laſt time.</p>
            <p>Now as I cannot find the I eaſt Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any One word, Doctrine, or Precept, that any perſons were, or ſhould be Compelled, by <hi>Outward Force</hi> to come or continue in the Chriſtian Church in the Firſt Age, ſo neither can it be agreeable to the Mind of Our Lord, that any perſons ſhould be Compelled by <hi>Temporal Penalties</hi> ſo to do againſt their Minds in After Ages, Unleſs you can ſhew us, that the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles are not the ſame in After Ages, that they were when they were firſt delivered.</p>
            <p>Say you, <hi>It is to Teach my People that they need never come to Church more, but have my Free Leave, as they have the King's, to go to a Conventicle, or to Maſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Does any thing of this kind Flow naturally from the King's <hi>Declaration?</hi> Does that Engage or Incline you, or any Man elſe to teach any Doctrine contrary to his own Sentiment? I take it rather to be an Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do, and ſay ſincerely what they apprehend, and believe to be the Will of God, relating to the Worſhip of himſelf, and that your Leave is neither Asked nor Granted in my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from your Church, further than this, That if I be Excommunicate by you for it, you cannot thereupon, by your <hi>Certificate,</hi> obtain as formerly, the Writ <hi>De Excommunicato Capien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> to make me a perpetual Priſoner, whilſt the King is pleaſed to Suſpend the Execution of that Penalty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Declaration</hi> does not Teach any of your Hearers, that they need not come to Church, and Worſhip God any more there in that Way and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if in their Own Conſciences they are Convinced they ought ſo to do; It does not Forbid your Teaching or Reading to your People any <hi>Doctrines,</hi> or <hi>Homilies</hi> Approved of by the Church of England, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (which ſhe Enjoyned to be Read in your <hi>Churches</hi> Four Times in a Year,) or any thing Elſe by which they may be Inſtructed in the knowledge, or diſcharge of their Duty to God in your <hi>Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You greatly undervalue your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Doctrine, to ſuppoſe that there are no Arguments to prevail with your People to come to your Church, but only <hi>Temporal Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> For if you have the Truth of God on your ſide, as no Humane Law can Alter the Nature of it, ſo you are at Liberty, notwithſtanding any thing in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> to Preach it to your People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:96454:9"/>The Declaration is an Incitement to all the King's Subjects <hi>to Worſhip God,</hi> and no enticement for any of them to forſake his Worſhip, and that they may reſpectively ſerve God, (as the Chriſtian Religion teaches, in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs) without fear: His Majeſty promiſes Equal Protection to all who do worſhip God in ſuch Way and Manner, as each of them Underſtand and Believe, it is his Will they ſhould do; And in the firſt place gives the Royal Countenance and Protection to <hi>All of the Church of England in their worſhiping of God in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as by Law Eſtabliſhed:</hi> So that you make a wrong Gloſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Declaration, in inſinuating that it Teacheth your People, that they need never to come to Church more, or that they have the King's Free Leave, or Yours, contrary to their own Minds and Conſciences to forſake the Church, or to go to a Conven<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticle, or to Maſs. For <hi>there is nothing in the Declaration that requires, gives Leave or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to any man to forſake that Religion, and way of Worſhip to which his Conſcience obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges him,</hi> or to Diſſemble, and play the Hypocrite, in forſaking of any one way, and (in appearance) to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to another, if he do it not in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, but againſt his Mind and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>But we are now come to another Point, at which you ſeem to ſtick more than at all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Say you, <hi>It is to Teach the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Power, which alters what has been formerly thought the whole Conſtitution of this Church and Kingdom, which we dare not do, till we have the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Parliament for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this Matter then, as you ſay in your Letter, be examined Impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and take in here alſo that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion I touched upon before; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Matter of the King's Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration herein be contrary to the Laws of the Land?

The Act for Uniformity in the 14th Year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thoſe Grants to Foreigners; and Provides, <hi>that the Penalties of that Act, ſhall not extend to ſuch Churches as have been Allowed, or ſhall be Allowed by the King, His Heirs or Succeſſors.</hi>

            <p>To make good this, That the King's Diſpenſing Power in His Declaration, alters what has been formerly thought the whole Conſtitution of this Church: It is Incumbent on you, to ſhew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it does ſo, more th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This is a bare Suppoſition, ariſing meerly from your own Diſturbed Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, which is through Prejudice ſo Darkned, that you cannot diſcern between your Friends and your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: I can tell you of many, who neither Hope, nor ſeek to make any Advantage againſt you, your Church or Religion, that are diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at your refuſing to Read, becauſe you thereby give an Advantage to ſuch as may be your Adverſaries, which they could never have gained by your Compliance with the King's Order.</p>

               <hi>If We muſt compare Conſequences, To Diſ-oblige all the Nobility and Gentry, by Reading the Declaration, is likely to be much more Fatal then to Anger the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:96454:12"/>If it were not ſo, You would never have taken the Method you have done, to draw your Concluſion from ſuch Compariſon of Conſequences, as you have made; <hi>to Diſoblige all the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Gentry, is likely to be much more Fatal, then to Anger the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> Would you have it Conceited, That you have Engaged the Nobility and Gentry by a Poſitive Promiſe, upon no Terms to part with the Penal Laws, or give the Diſſenters any Eaſe, till you Signifie to them, by Reading the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, That it is an Opportunity, wherein they may Do it without any Danger?</p>
            <p>Have you no Cauſe, as you are a Miniſter of the Goſpel, to relent at the Hard Meaſure, which You, and Others by your Inſtigation have Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out to the Diſſenters of all Sorts?

            <p>But you are for putting a Queſtion Ironically, and Anſwering it plainly and poſitively: <hi>Cannot the King keep his Promiſe to the Church of England, if the Teſt and Penal Laws be Repeal'd?</hi> Your Anſwer is, <hi>We cannot ſay, but this may be; And yet the Nation does not think fit to try it; and if the Question were put to us, We think We ought in Conſcience to deny them Our Selves, and we Commend thoſe Great Men that deny it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This looks as if your Paſſions were in a high Ferment, and yet there is ſome appearance of an Artifice in it: It Sounds with what follows, as if you had an Aſſurance, That the gene <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Let me for once after your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample (tho I come One Thouſand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſhort of your skill in the Doctrine) Conjecture at a few probable Points.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It ſeems to me that you are convinced in your Conſcience that there is <hi>Such an innate Vertue and Power in the matter o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the King's Declaration, as will command an Aſſent in the minds of them that hear and conſider it;</hi> whence it may be, That you think in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience it is not ſafe for your Intereſt to Read it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you were not under ſome ſuch Conviction, it's probable <hi>you</hi> would make as little Conſcience to read it, as you did any of thoſe Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures or Orders, which you cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe juſtifie, than as you therein only performed a Miniſterial / Act, in Obedience to your Superiours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It's very probable, that it is alſo from hence, that in your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96454:12"/>
you run altogether upon the Topicks of <hi>Truſting to the King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> and upon a <hi>Repeal of the Teſt and Penal Laws,</hi> and ſpeak not a Word; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the King's <hi>making no doubt of the Concurrence of his two hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament</hi> (when he ſhall think ſit to call them) to this Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Indulgence, (which he mentions in the firſt Paragraph of it) or of <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Conjuring His Subjects to lay aſide all private Animoſities, as well as ground leſs Jealouſies, and to chooſe ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, as may do their part to finiſh what he has begun,</hi> (in the cloſe of it) or of any of the Clauſes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole of it, or of His Majeſty's Endeavours to <hi>eſtabliſh Liberty of Conſcience on ſuch juſt and equal Foundations, as will vender it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable, and ſecure to all People the free Exerciſe of their Religion for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this be plainly manifeſt, (as it is in its ſelf, and will appear to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man who is not ſcar'd by you from conſidering it) that it is not any one <hi>Single Clauſe but the whole and every part of the Declaration,</hi> that the King ſeeks to have Eſtabliſhed by a <hi>Perpetual Law;</hi> and that he would have this ſpeedily Effected. Why is it that you deſcant ſo much upon His Royal Promiſe, (of the ſtedfaſtneſs whereof, we have had ſo general an Experience) as if that were all the Security intended to Perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; unleſs you have ſtill a Mind to Monopolize the Laws to your ſelves, and that none of His Subjects ſhould have the Benefit of any Law, but ſuch as will (though it be contrary to their Conſcience) Conform to a Tittle to your Meaſures and Modes of Worſhip?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It may be alſo probable, if a Parliament be ſpeedily called, as His Majeſty declares he intends it ſhall be, that they, when they are met, will wiſely Conſider, how both to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the King in what he deſires, and ſecure the Subject in all their Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Civil and Religious: For the Sum of all that is to be Granted, <hi>de Novo, Is Liberty of Conſcience, to worſhip God without incurring any temporal damage by it.</hi> What things are already ſetled by Law, as to <hi>the Religion of the Church of England, and their Poſſeſsions,</hi> are ſo to continue, and be <hi>confirmed</hi> to them. And if ſuch a New Law be contrived to this Purpoſe, as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever, it will require ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients to be in it, as may by the Proviſions therein made, (which the Wiſdom of Parliament will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſuggeſt,) render it ſtable and perpetual, and it may be in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ſuch as may prevent your ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted Jealouſies of <hi>Preiſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and alſo, keep you as well as them, within the Spheres of your proper Function, that all of the Clergy who expect the Benefit of other Laws, ſhall ſubſcribe t before your Eyes, that no Royal Promiſe, no ſetled Laws, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Intereſt can diſpel it, ſo as to give a Diſcerning of the proper Means to Arrive at a ſecure Eſtabliſhment?</p>
