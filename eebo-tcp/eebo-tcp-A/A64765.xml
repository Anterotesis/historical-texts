            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Is our Custome in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, on the birth Day of every Year, for the Tenant to lay down his Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Altar of his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord; as an Oblation of his gratefull Servitude.</p>
            <p>I, your Lordships Tenant, or rather, as the Anagram tells me, Natent, (confessing my self by your Lordships Solar Influence, Renated, and of a Vegetable,
<pb facs="tcp:50532:3"/>
made Vitall) not to abrogate Custom, do here present my Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, to manifest a strong desire of Gratitude, in the weakness of my Expressions.</p>
            <p>Our first Wishes upon this Day, is, for a merry new Year. What better Prologue to Mirth, than a Feast? That my Offering therefore may be the Embleme of my Wishes, I have here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented your Lordship with an <hi>Hermeticall</hi> Banquet; wherein are such plenty of Cordialls, that I doubt not but it will make you heartily Merry.</p>
            <p>I have caused it to be drest by Spagiricall Cooks; partly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve your more Delicate Palate
<pb facs="tcp:50532:3"/>
from the Epidemicall <hi>Nausea</hi> of Galenicall Potions, with these our Hermeticall and Bezoartick Delicacies. And partly, because I have alwaies observ'd, in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversalities of your Lordships Studies, a particular Genius much reflecting upon this Art, as the Key of Natures Cabinet.</p>
            <p>Expect not much Hony in your Dishes; since like a Bee, shut up in the Winter Hive of my Quarantena, and unable to fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and rob other Mens Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, was constrained to make use of such as I had collected in the Summer of my Youth: where I fear your Lordship will find more Wax, than Hony. I dance
<pb facs="tcp:50532:4"/>
little after Method, because no Methodist. Neither do I labour to oppress your Stomack with Dogmaticall Gravity.</p>
            <p>No, I consider we are at a Feast, and therefore prefer a Jest before an Aphorisme.</p>
            <p>How my Mirth will take, I know not, believe me it was meant well: though for want of other Musick I confess it is somewhat extravagant.</p>
            <p>I subscribe therefore to your Lordships more mature Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which, like a Celestiall Influence, penetrates even the Center of Inferiour Actions.</p>
            <p>If it pass that Magellan, it may boldly, and with a full Sail
<pb facs="tcp:50532:4"/>
plow through the Tempestuous Ocean of the Universe.</p>
            <p>'Tis your Lordships appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation then that must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect our weak B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For as in the Entrals of the Earth (partly the exhaling vertue of the Suns rays, partly by Astrall Influences, as also by a proper and inbread heat of the Earth) many variable Species of Exhalations and vapours are exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which are the Essence of so many mixt and imperfect Bodies there generated, such as are those diversities of Sulphurs, Minerall salts, Bitumens, Mercuriall humidities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>So likewise in this Terrene Globe Man, we find no lesse variety generated: Here being Saccharine salts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nutritive.</p>

            <p>Aluminous and Pontick, which are Steg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticall, Stypticall, and Corroborating the Retentive faculties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50532:11"/>And lastly Acide, Vitriolate and Esurine Salts, which Concoct, Distribute, and excite Apetite.</p>

            <p>For there is one sort of Sulphur which is Odoriferous and Fragrant; Recreating and Renovative.</p>
            <p>An other Faetide, Narcoticall, and Stupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factive.</p>

            <p>The chief point therefore which will oppose your Common sense (at having long since stagger'd Galenicall Philosophy and made them almost reele out of their Method) is
<pb facs="tcp:50532:12"/>
those Sulphurs, Bitumens, Vitriolated Salts, Mercuriall Liquors, Muscilaginous Tartars, and such like, which Hermeticks so rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrate to be generated in our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosme.</p>
            <p>Here you must expect but a leane satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, if you take Counsell of a Galenist. For they will allow man to be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitomy of the greater World: but the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizations which must adde perfection to the Analogy they invidiously renege.</p>
            <p>Aske them why? and they answer, that they are dissonant to Galen's Principles: and that they never found more in Man than the four humors Blood, Choler, Phlegma, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholia.</p>
            <p>This is just an answer given in Method.

               </gap>quors could ever see or tast any such imaginary Salts.</p>
            <p>Yet me thinks I over-heare a secret confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on acknowledge that in many Wines which have past a triall of Fire, you have often found store of Saccharine Salts</p>
            <p>Sweet Sir be not then so glucupricontical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obstinate: but let's to work, and make the Alembick our moderator. I will give you an instance in a cup of Claret, to excite ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity in our operations, and to extract your errours out of your own Element. In this distillation your dullest sense shall feele the truth of our argument and you shall see in this enucleation of Wine both Vitriolated, Nitrosulphureous, and Tartareous Salts; which demonstrated, Consequence shall force your beliefe to acknowledge the same in our blood.</p>
            <p>By the way I desire you to be patient and stir not, lest we break Glasses: for this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is very phlegmatick; and your Choler may alter our degree of heat, and so produce
<pb facs="tcp:50532:15"/>
an Empyreuma in our Aquavitae. Stand quietly therefore with expectation (like a Spaniard at the siege of a <hi>Piazz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </hi>) and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently your errour shall evaporate, and both our opinions shall dance together in a Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck. Marke therefore how true an Analogy there is between Wine and Mans bloud and then tell me whether Hermeticks nurse any Opinions but what are legitimate to reason.</p>
            <p>From Wine, therefore, we first Sublimate the Aquavitae, by a temperat heat in <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From Bloud, by the same soft naturall heat of the heart, is separated the Aquavitae also, <hi>Spiritus vitalis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe from Aquavitae, by Rectification and Circulation, we extract the Spirits of Wine, a part more aethereall and essentiall than Aquavitae, a drop whereof let fall, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In these preparations, remaine great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of unprofitable Phlegme.</p>
            <p>And is not the same in Bloud?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50532:16"/>After the Separation of the spirits and Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma from Wine, there remains store of dregs which abound with Sulphur, Niter, and Tartar.</p>
            <p>The like shall you discover in the distillation of Bloud, where Choler doth aptly Symbolize with those Faeces, that being Nitrosulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous.</p>
            <p>Of the Dregs of Wine is made Vinegar, whose Pontick and Acide Taste doth wholy resemble naturall Melancholy, which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides in the Bloud, and from whence nature supplys the Kitchin of her Stomack with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, her Cook using no other Sawce to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite appetite.</p>
            <p>In the distillation of Vinegar likewise their remains a Tartareous Sediment, so sharp, black, and acrimonious, (the major part being a Vitriolated Salt) that dissolve the least quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it in a competent part of Water, and it instantly inquinats the whole masse, making it Acide like Vinegar.</p>
            <p>And this is likewise seen in the Bloud; for those black dregs of Vinegar, correspond unto black Choler or Melancholy Adust as you falsely call it: for it is not such, from any Adustion, as you dreame; but from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Mercuriall, from their Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous parts; by whose permixtion, before
<pb facs="tcp:50532:16"/>
it was made temperate, those Corrosive Salts being as it were lull'd asleep in Mercuriall Humidityes: which is evidently seen in Culi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Vinegar, whose Mercuriall Phlegma not separated is edible and usefull: but those hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midityes by ebullition once evaporated, his Salts like drowned Flyes sensible of heat, begin to actuate, as your Tongue may taste and testifie.</p>
            <p>'Tis evident therefore, Adustion cannot produce such Acrimonies: for give Common Water, or the Phlegma of Wine, all the ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and re ebullitions you can, they shall never be brought to this Acrimony which you call Adustion, because they are destitute of those Vitriolated and Nitrosulphureous Salts.</p>
            <p>What you find in this Anatomy of Wine, the very same is likewise in Cyder, Perry, and Beer: and not our Drinks only, but all our nourishment, be it of Vegetables or Animals, abounds with those Sulphurs and Salts.</p>
            <p>How then shall the Bloud escape from their infection? your own Master tells you <hi>talem esse Sanguinem, quale Nutrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He reason why I begin with the <hi>Stomaticall</hi> part of the <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosme,</hi> is, because we are at a Feast. And indeed such a Feast where every one shall find Appetite in his Dish.</p>
               <p>This Part being likewise our Cooks judgement Hall (where <hi>Pallatus</hi> sitteth aloft as Judge, and <hi>Appetitus</hi> his Baylieff under him, summoning every Dish to his triall) 'tis requisite that we here first make our Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation before we fall to Execution.</p>
               <p>Besides as it is the <hi>Microcosmes</hi> Kitchin, it must of necessity be first supply'd, since the whole World is nourisht by his Alms.</p>
               <p>The Stomack also is the Physitians best Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack

by which he Prognosticats what weather is likely to insue, and what alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be expected from the middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Microcosme.</hi> 'Tis necessary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we first look into that: for when we have discover'd his indispositions and distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, we shall the better learn how to preserve the whole <hi>Microcosme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every one therefore which is carefull of his best Treasure, <hi>Health,</hi> must first reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Part, as the little Worlds Nurse, which duly sendeth her Milk by the Mesera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks, unto every Part.</p>
               <p>If this our Nurse therefore have by disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or bad Diet, her Milk or Chylus inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, how can the other Parts her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren expect health from such corruptible Nourishment?</p>

               <p>Such as the Devil is, such is his Broth: and from sowre Cream we must not expect sweet Butter.</p>
               <p>That my Guests therefore may not sit pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Teeth for want of Apetite, I will here give you a Catalogue of those Principles w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Nature presented unto that great Monarck of the <hi>Microcosme</hi> (when she first establisht him in his Dominions) to the end he might

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50532:25"/>But alas good old Man, he is no whit cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable since <hi>nihil perfectionem in principio gaudet.</hi> He left the <hi>Embryo</hi> of his Labours for future Ages to perfect and preserve from abortment. He gave us the first, and true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of Health, and left us the <hi>Scizza.</hi> Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticks they have wrought it to Life, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with the naturall Colours, Tinctures, and Spirits themselves: so that their Industry hath made them so excellent in this Art of Painting, that had they but such a coppy of the Soul, I think they would ease Nature, and make her Creatures for her.</p>
               <p>I would gladly understand then why our Neotericall Dogmatists do not endeavour to perfect this Designe of their Masters: or at least why they will not take a Coal in Hand, and adde a shadow to the perfection of his <hi>Scizza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, by no means their hands shall not be guilty of our Venemous Mineralls.</p>
               <p>They dare not enter into the Hell of our Laboratory for fear the Spirits fly about their Fars. They say we preach new Doctrine, and labour to silence us; Mineralls they all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim as Venemous yet all their principal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes are infected with them.</p>
               <p>Who doubts of this let him examine <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repsus</hi> his Book <hi>de Antidotis</hi> (where he hath
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50532:25"/>
selected the choisest and most authentick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of all the select Band of Galenists) there you shall finde more than a hundred Antidotes whose Basis and principal ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents are either Mineralls or Semi mineralls, and those crude and unprepar'd. There <hi>in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doto persicae Pauli,</hi> you shall see both crude Sulphur, and five dragmes of unpraepar'd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senick, which I suppose he intended for an <gap reason="foreign">

In that Divine <hi>Panacea,</hi> that so admir'd <hi>Chaos</hi> of Druggs, <hi>Theriaca,</hi> is not <hi>Calcitis</hi> an Ingredient? In <hi>Mirepsus</hi> his <hi>Mithridate</hi> is not calcin'd Lead cald in as one of the Jury? Are not <hi>Lapis Lazulus</hi> and <hi>Lap. Armenus,</hi> two of your Familiar Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits against Melancholy.</p>
               <p>Again they say Mineralls are too violent in their Operations. Let them look well into their Vegetables, and then tell me if <hi>Tithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malus, Thapsia, Helleb. alb. &amp; nig. Pityusa, Elatorium, Colocynthis, Turpetum, Bryonia, Scammonium, Thymelaea, Chamelaea, Cycla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi>

&amp;c. Do not emulate the violence of the most Tyrannicall Minerall, torturing every Nerve on the Rack of Convulsions.</p>
               <p>Here I lose my self in admiration to see so many famous Physitians of our Times lie puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zling in the Dust of Ignorance; where losing their Eyes they lye groaping in the Dunghil of their Drugs, whilst the Hermeticks pick out the Pearls.</p>
               <p>They see that every Mans Stomack riseth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Physick; and yet they will still persecute poor Nature, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Go to a Methodist, tell him your Stomack is debillitated by a cold distemper, and he will presently prescribe you the Decoction of <hi>Anise, Rew,</hi> and <hi>Parsely</hi> Seed, with <hi>Diatrion-Piperion, Diacalamint. Theriaca</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>If your weakness proceed from heat and cholerick humors, he bids you purge with <hi>Hiera Picra (Galenae Stomaticall Panacaea)</hi> and to drink <hi>Endive</hi> and <hi>Succory</hi> Waters, mixt with Vinegar. Why this is pure Judaical Physick imitating the Cure they used to our Saviour, when he suffered Thirst on the Cross.</p>
               <p>Me thinks as the Old Law is, so their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick likewise should be abrogated.</p>
               <p>Be not dismaid at these Relations good Guest! for here He promiseth your entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50532:26"/>
shall be more Christian like. And when your <hi>Microcosme</hi> shall discover any such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, retire to our Spagiricall Kitchin, over whose Door you shall find written, <hi>Sapores palato ingrati procul absint.</hi> There you shall not be allur'd to give Christian buryall to a Jewish Potion, by perswasive Apologies: but believe me, the sweetnesse of your cure, shall bring a plesant recompence to the bitterness of your Malady.</p>
               <p>Whosoever therefore is subject to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitation of the Stomack: proceeding from a mixt distemper of Humors, be they <hi>Tartarius, Vitriolate, Nitrosulphureous</hi> or <hi>Mercuriall</hi>: let him before he tast of our Preservatives, first secure the Stomack from all such false Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, by taking one, two, or three grains of our Hermeticall <hi>Panchymagogon.</hi> For La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes and such delicate Tempers, one graine renders a compleat Operation. You may mix it with any Dissolvent your Stomack most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of; as Wine, Bear, Broth, Posset-drink, or any liquidity. Or you may lend it the form of a Pill by addition of some Conserve, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malade, Quidiny Geladine or the like. 'Tis not guilty either of Tast or smell, neither doth it seek by Violence to put any man out of his humor. No, you shall find it as good a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as may be; and one that will dance after
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50532:27"/>
the Caprizzio of every ones humor. For if they be Cholerick, and will at the first Dash <hi>con la Furia Francese,</hi> give a Scalado by the upper Orifice; he straight Consents, helps, and follows. Or if they abound with Spanish Phlegma, and desire rather to entrench them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves first, and so make a long Seidge; why, he plays the Pyoner, there too, and flings out as fast as the stoutest. Believe me the Operation hereof is miraculous, and the little Experience which I have made would consume Volumes in the Description; but as from my purpose I defer it to some better Occasion. Here I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour only to preserve, not to Cure. If Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture therefore suspect any Summer Assault, by Acute and malignant Fevers, Tertians, Pluri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, or the like; this taken in the Spring breaks their Designes. If she fear any Autumnall Skirmish or Winter Seidge, by some Cronicall Disease do but scowre the Enemies Trenches with this Artillery and (under God) I dare promise her Peace.</p>
               <p>The preparation of this <hi>Panchymagogon</hi> is thus. You must first rob our Hermetticall Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier when he rides Post to <hi>Caelum Christalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and take from him two ounces of his false Diamonds.</p>
               <p>Then open a Vein in your Mothers Belly, and from her Coagulated Bloud you shall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50532:27"/>

               <p>But if any of you fear a Vomit by reason of a streight Chest, I recommend him to our <hi>Tetrapharmacon Panchymagogon,</hi> whose O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration is exprest in an easie and low Stile, never ambitiously reaching at those high streins.</p>
               <p>Having thus scowr'd your Ditches, and cast up your Parapetts, that your Fort may be strong for Battery, now you must begin to fortifie your Walls, and look to your Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works; renue your weak Flanks, and let Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, your Inginier, search where and what Part is most subject to the Mine and there prepare her Counter-Mines: For by strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preserving this Piazza, you need not fear the whole World.</p>

And that all exteriour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as Ulcers, Wounds, &amp;c. may be brought to an exact sanation without any locall appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but meerly by a Magneticall Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>
               <p>This Opinion I know will be better than a Gig to our modern Methodists to provoke Laughter: But let them beware, in their Laughter they revive not the Example of <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with dribling Oratory; every Eye like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise being so retir'd, that their Gravity eclyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all suspect of Lightness. When he had finish'd this Master-peece, and wrought it so neer to the Life, that Art had almost lost her Interest in it; he was so overcome with the extravagancy of his Pensills perfection, that bursting into a violent Laughter, he let out his soul to animate his Pourtraict.</p>

               <p>Here (Purpose bringing me upon it) to make this new Art more Speculative, and my Opinion more apparent, I will give you an Ocular Instance.</p>
               <p>In all <hi>Opthalmies</hi> where a <hi>Plethora</hi> doth indicate evacuation, we have an Hermeticall <hi>Opthalmick</hi> water whereof three drops put into the Eye hath these three Properties.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I did let your Noses go a little too soon: here is a bloudy Action put in against them, which may cost some of you your Lives. I should be very sorry to see any of my Guest throw away themselves by their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Believe me tis to be pittyed, and I
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50532:52"/>
would spend part of my best Bloud to save them.</p>
               <p>Whensoever therefore Prodigious drops of Bloud shall fall from the upper Region of the <hi>Microcosme,</hi> knock at our Hermeticall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets Door: for there you shall finde a <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paticall</hi> Powder, which increaseth both in Quantity and Quality every time you make use of it: One Dragm of which is sufficient for an Army. 'Tis to be preserv'd in some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle box in your Pocket, and when your Nose bleeds let but a drop or two fall on this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: then put up the Box presently from the Aer, and you shall find your Bloud stop mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously. And thus it Cures all Fluxes of Bloud either of Man or Woman without any other helps. And this I have here Inserted, to adde a Nerve to the Truth of our former Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>Here when I call to minde the Malice of Ignorance, I could play the Montinbanco and draw Teeth. But from whom? not from my Guess! but from the Jawes of those <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> whose Canine and rabid Envy like that of <hi>Timonus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Man-hater (<hi>quod nihil ingratius animo concipiat quam erga Homines benevolum ac beneficum Deum se habere, eos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que prosperè ac feliciter prospiciat degere</hi>) runs snarling and biting at every Man. Nay Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

her self cannot pass them! But because she is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and favours Man with the use of her Secrets, they hourly labour to discredit her, and ruin her Reputation with their Malignant Calumnies. But she is so well armed with her <hi>Panacaeae,</hi> and Truths <hi>Arcani,</hi> that in vain with <hi>Aesops</hi> Dog they do but bark at the Moon.</p>
               <p>While I was Student in <hi>Padoua,</hi> upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular occasions, I have often tasted of that bitter <hi>Galenicall</hi> Envy against <hi>Hermeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> discipline. Amongst which this was one.</p>
               <p>Walking one day in the Garden of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, with one of the Professours of that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy in Physick: (and none of the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest neither) we gathered our Discourse out of our Mothers Aperne: where I by chance taking up the Herb <hi>Heliotropium</hi> (whose name discovers his Solar Sympathy) it gave me occasion to sublimate the Terrestriety of our Discourse into Celestiall Influences, where rising from the bare and Elementary Vertues of Herbs an other Vegetables<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we flew up at last unto their Occult Qualities: where I made sure account to have adorn'd the naked Wings of my <hi>Quaesiti,</hi> with the choisest Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of this Old Asclepians Answers.</p>
               <p>I entred him upon the Signatures of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables and Mineralls, telling him how many
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50532:53"/>
miraculous Cures I had seen from <hi>Sympatical</hi> Remedies, to the great Amazement of the Ignorant, and to the greater Elogie of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick,</hi> whose enucleating Curiosity had thus stole into Natures most secret Mysteries.</p>
               <p>The good Man was so suddenly cholerick to hear me attribute any Truth or belief to <hi>Sympaticall Physick,</hi> that he had no leasure to answer me with Patience; but, calling me <hi>Paracelsian,</hi> he began very <hi>Galenically</hi> to rail in Method against our <hi>Hermetick</hi> Discipline: telling me that if I had ever read <hi>Galen</hi> or <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> I should Impart little Honour to any of our <hi>Chymiatri,</hi> or <hi>Impyricall Charletaines,</hi> who contemning rationall Method, apply themselves wholly to Venimous Mineralls, Magick Spells, and Diabolicall Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters.</p>
               <p>Our Art, in that University being prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted! I durst not cure those broken Heads with our Balsamicall Reasons, which he so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wounded with the blunt Beetle of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
               <p>But letting him run on his Heat; his over angry Tongue had so bastonadoed his teeth, that at last they Silenc'd him with a vendica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Dolor. Nature I think visiting his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance on purpose to shew him the experience of her <hi>Sympaticall</hi> Secrets.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:50532:53"/>Here like the <hi>Samaritan</hi> I took out a little Violl from the <hi>Pharmacopaea</hi> of my Pocket, and profer'd to lend him ease. Imagine with what scorn he contemn'd my younger Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise: but bidding me follow him to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, I should see he was not destitute of Remedies far better than any of my <hi>Impyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Fopperies. There he made a mixture of <hi>Theriaca</hi> with a grain or two of <hi>Opium,</hi> with which he fill'd the hollow Vault of his ruin'd Tooth. This by the <hi>narcoticall Sulphur</hi> of the <hi>Opium,</hi> stupefied the Nerve, and so for a while mock'd his martyr'd Sence with a seeming Ease: which brought him presently into the Vanity of his Secret <hi>Encomium,</hi> asking me how long I would undertake to dig before I found a Mineral so rarely qualify'd. I laughing ask'd how long it might be before he expected the return of his Currier: at which very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, his <hi>Opiate</hi> was now overcome; and his Dolour answer'd him in a Duplicate.</p>
               <p>Once more I abused him with Curtesie, and desired him to make use of my <hi>Sympaticall Unguent:</hi> praying him but to draw bloud from his aking Tooth with his tooth-picker, and make a Resignation of the stick to me; I would return him an Acquittance of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, without any locall application.</p>
               <p>My Oportunity at last won his Obedience:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50532:54"/>
and his Toothpick was no sooner buried in my <hi>Sympaticall Vnguent,</hi> but a sudden ease con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted his Expectation. Who, like a <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codyle,</hi> when I had picked the dolor out of his Teeth, he was like to have swallowed me up with his malitious Oratory: telling me that this Cure was Diabolicall, answerable to our <hi>Hermetick</hi> Doctrine; and advised me not to make farther use of it, but to content my Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise with rationall <hi>Galenicall</hi> Ingredients.</p>
               <p>I must confess it angred me to hear a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher so lost in Obstinacy, who blushed not to repay the Vse of Natures Secrets, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. His Ignorance gave my Teeth such an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that I could never since masticate a <hi>Galenicall</hi> Sallad.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I hope you are more rationall, and better natured: and when a Tooth pains you, will rather make use of our Sympaticall Unguent, than draw it out.</p>
               <p>In this my <hi>Cephalicall</hi> Course, twenty to one but some old Lady will be looking for a Dish to renovate Natures defac'd Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece with some Artificiall Shadow: Or to illuminate her <hi>Microcosmical Map</hi> with the superficiall Beauty of our <hi>Hermeticall</hi> Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
               <p>To say the Truth, I had prepared many Dishes for this effect: but my fear was lest
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50532:54"/>
some of our younger Beauties (whose Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is so compleat that Nature her self hath many years since confessed she cannot adde unto it) would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for want of more substantiall Pastimes, fall a dappling with our Spagiricall Accidents: and like ambitious Painters, which never thinking their Retraits finished, with too much Curiosity spoil the whole Peece. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I should be heartily sorry to see a good Face marr'd for want of a Play-fellow.</p>
               <p>To such pregmaticall Fansies therefore I will shortly (God willing) make a Present, wherein they shall finde such variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, that I doubt not but many a Fair Face will thank me for it.</p>
               <p>In the mean Time I wish that their busie Heads may nor abuse the Innocencie of their Beauty, cheating themselves of Natures Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure under a Colour of fair dealing.</p>
               <p>The desire therefore which I have to see such Beauties flourish in their Meridian, hath made me lose many a nights sleep in Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before I could attain to their true externall <hi>Prophylactick.</hi> I sent the Embassadours of my Fansie through every part of the World for <hi>Vegetables, Mineralls, Semimineralls, Fukes, Belletti, Smegmatick Secrets, Vnctions, Poma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, Waters,</hi> any thing that had or might be practized in that nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:50532:55"/>Faith I found all to be but Curtains to a good Picture, which only kept the Dust from it, but Eclypsed the Glory of it.</p>
               <p>Yet I could not rest thus satisfyed, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded my self that Nature had given all things their Preservatives. In which contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation I called to minde how that Celestiall Beauty, the Sun, used no other Art but fair Water, Morning and Evening washing his bright Rayes in that Fountain the Sea.</p>
               <p>This then as Natures best Secret for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a lively, ruddy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cleer, and Snowy skin, I freely impart to all Faire Faces: wishing them to make some clear fountain their Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to dabble there as long as they please: remembring that they make not that, their Glass of <hi>Philautia</hi>; and so Sacrifice their good Faces to <hi>Narcissus.</hi>

               <p>I think few men would do so much for a Mistriss as I have done for her.

Upon this I desired him to give me a little bottle of that water to carry into my Country as a Rarity. By no means quoth he, for it will make you run Mad and scold with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all you meet. Why then said I are not all your Women mad?

               <p>I began to thank <hi>Iove</hi> here, that this Well was so far from our Country: though I did suspect that some of them had been licking here. The generall love therefore which I bare to that Sex, made me in pitty, not able to see their Tongues so infected; but drawing my Sword I beat away more than a hundred of those Tongue-loaden Knaves, which were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to this Well: (presuming that some

Wittall or other would put me in his prayers for it) and then knowing I had committed an Errour by drawing my sword in the <hi>Arsenall,</hi> out I ran all in Choler, and as yellow as a <hi>Kites</hi> leg. I had not gone far from thence, but I met my wandring Mistris <hi>Sanitas</hi> with a double <hi>Tertian</hi> on her back. She perceived that I had been lately in Choler, which made her come shaking to me, and excuse her long absence with trembling Apologies. I took her by the hand (which Fear had benum'd with a sleepy chilness) and asked her why she trembled so? Oh quoth she, the fear which I have that you will not keep me, turns me all into a Gelly. So that the <hi>Organ</hi> pipe of your breath only makes me answer you in quavers.</p>
               <p>The poor Girl lent me such pittifull looks, that I had a feeling of her misery: wherefore I presently eased her of the burden of her Song, and took a <hi>Tertian</hi> on my Back, in place of a Knap-sack, and away we went to seek out some charitable Hospitall.

my Mistris <hi>Sanitas,</hi> finding no provision there that was Edible, all things being so unsavory with those brackish waters, that what ever we put into our Mouths Nature thought time lost in masticating them.

               <p>Gentlemen, if any of you be Travellers, and Curiosity lead you at any time to visit the <hi>Hepatick</hi> Dominions, see first in the Map of my Travells whether you can make any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations profitable for so dangerous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate a Voyage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Read my description of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Court, and see if her entertainment can allure you out of your Country. And when you go, be sure to make <hi>Health</hi> your Mistirss, and when you come to <hi>Venus</hi> table, let not that wanton Hostess intise you to disorder. Or if she do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do not drink your Mistriss drunk that she might not be Jealous, and then play false under Nose. Have a speciall Care like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that you be not too familiar with that Lady <hi>Venus,</hi> for she is Mistris unto the Viceroy <hi>Spiritus Naturalis,</hi> of those <hi>Hepatick</hi> Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toryes, who will play the Tyrant if he take you napping: bringing you first on your knees to a publike Confession, and then delivering you into the Hands of the Tormentor, who puts
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50532:68"/>
you into a little Hole like a Tub, and feeds you with nothing but dry musty Crufts, and puddle water, the very smell whereof puts you into <hi>Symptomaticall</hi> sweats. There hee'l smoak you like a Bacon hog: and for fourty dayes you must expect twice a day to be stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your own grease. Believe me every bone will have a feeling of his Torments, and though at last he relieve you, yet you shall never be your own man again.</p>
               <p>If you incounter with <hi>Bacchus</hi> (as he is never from <hi>Venus</hi> Court) be sure that your first Cup be a parting Cup. And for <hi>Mars</hi> come not near him, lest you grow Cholerick, and so be inflamed, to your great loss of Bloud.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Hepatick</hi> Land is so delicious, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching, that few young men return from hence without a Calenture.</p>
               <p>Considering therefore how many strong and well-fleshed bodies are brought low in the <hi>Torrid-Zone</hi> of this <hi>Hepatick</hi> land, I have altogether laboured in this third Course to feed you as <hi>Venus</hi> fed me, onely with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storatives, that you may travell more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with me unto the Cardiacall Court.</p>

Here our Boat arriving at the Palace Gate, his Relation (which I found more Poetical than Rational) was silenc'd by the approach of his Mother the Lady <hi>Curiosita</hi>: who came thither ready with all her followers to attend my landing.

               <p>To say the truth, nothing blank'd me, but a scurvy durty Opinion, which like an evill Angell hourly persecuted me: telling me that my cloaths would subscribe to antiquity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Fortunes could renue their thred-bare Titles, by some better Calling.

to tremble fearing he might think I had stoln his suit of Apparell which I had then on my back: But <hi>Confidentia</hi> excus'd all, and told him I was a poor Gentleman, and a stranger that was betrai'd by Fortune, and therefore came thither alone, to manifest his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>

               <p>Here that I might enter into the Geneolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of his Kindred, knowing him to have a Spanish Heart, I bad her tell him that I was a <hi>Spaniard</hi>: my name <hi>Signior Aemulatio</hi>; base son to one <hi>Signior Ambitio</hi> a man of great blood in <hi>Spain,</hi> whose Estate being decai'd, left his tender Nursery to the blind Tuition of Fate: who had transplanted me out of that barren Soil, hither into his <hi>Cardiacall</hi> Garden, where I hop'd the Sun of his Favour would make me fruitfull.</p>

               <p>To those Yong Ladyes she goes; enters into their Cabinets; there falls into Discourse &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Conversation: First fingring them, as Lutanists do their more Delicate and choise Trebbles, with ordinary Womanish Discourse of Husbands; lamenting the unfortunate and miserable estate of a single life.</p>

the sweeter their answer was to the touch of her Triall.</p>
               <p>Then she playes on, makes them sing and dance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In which merry Tune, she lets the hand of her discourse by degrees slide down unto the belly of her <hi>Lenatick</hi> Lute, where by a more shrill and penetrating sweetness she brings their Ears to such an itching Delight, that <hi>Auditus</hi> can no longer keep Counsell, but presently calls in her Neighbour <hi>Sences</hi> to participate.

               <p>This Old Trot, runs Post Day and Night, from Chamber to Chamber, not suffering the poor Ladies to lie quietly in their Beds: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'twill deserve admiration if we find her in her own Lodgings: Besides we must expect a Bastonado ere we depart, for she hates to see any thing that is hand-some: nay Malice wrings her into a showre of tears, if she see but a healthfull body, and well apparelled, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen her Gates.</p>
               <p>Here in spite of her teeth we entered her

               <p>All her Chambers were full of false Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to make People appear ill favour'd and dismember'd; for she could not abide that any one should discover themselves to be handsome.</p>
               <p>She had more than fourscore old decaied waiting Gentlewomen attending on her; all which had been turned out of service: some for putting <hi>Mercury</hi> in their Lady Mistrisses <hi>Pomade</hi> to spoil their good Faces.</p>

               <p>Others for wearing out every other Day a new ruff with often turning it in and out of fashion.</p>
               <p>Those came all about us like so many Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, some pissing on my Stockins to stain them; others under pretence of Courtesie to pick out the lace of my Cuffs &amp; tear them; Others with an Envious Hug twine their Armes about my Neck to bring my band in the same wrinkled

               <p>
                  <hi>Signiora Confidentia</hi> wanted not her share neither; for some presented her with a sweet powder for her Hairs, which brought them the falling sickness; Others gave her receipts for her Teeth, which made them all dance out in method; Others pretending to renew the lost curles of her hair, sets them afire; Others gave her waters to make her fair, which no sooner applide, but her face looked like a pick'd <hi>Goose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others, without farther Ceremonies call'd her Whore, scrach'd her face, telling she was the cause of their disgraces.</p>
               <p>Whilest we were in this Purgatory, In came the Lady <hi>Invidia,</hi> with her brother <hi>Il Conte Odio,</hi> and her Sister <hi>la Contessa Malitia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Never was man frighted with more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, than I at the sight of that Monster <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who ever saw the <hi>Bears</hi> Masque, may Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her entrance. She had eaten up all the flesh of her Face with her own scratches: so that she look'd as if her head had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed out in a Grave, to a Mess of hungry Worms, who had pick'd all clean to the bones.</p>
               <p>Her Eyes were so dry with often weeping,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50532:88"/>
that for want of moisture they had lost their motion: they being but as two pieces of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten shining Wood, stuck in a dead Horses Head.</p>
               <p>Her Nose, as I guest by the <hi>Promontorious</hi> Gristle had been Roman.</p>
               <p>She hopp'd towards me with an Intent to rail: but her mouth was so stuft with bitter Languages that she could not speak: for with belching up too many hasty words at once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the little Portal of her Mouth, they wedg'd one another so fast in the Door, that she salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me open mouth'd with a driveling Silence, just like a mad Dog, whose depraved Fancy could not resolve whether to bark or bite first.</p>
               <p>Her brother <hi>Count Odio</hi> had the Mine of a Compleat Courtier, and his better Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made him not dance into his Sisters Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate rashness: but with a reserved Malice, he made Flattery the Engine of his Hatred. Where like an old <hi>Ape</hi> with his mimicall and fawning Gestures he forced a belief of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that so (no false suspition opposing the Operation of his lingring Venom) whil'st you slept in security, he might with the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantage bite you.</p>
               <p>He entred upon me with a gratious smile;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50532:89"/>
desiring me not to take notice of his Sisters distemper, a womans weakness being too poor an Object for Masculine Reason: but rather bid me seal up her Envy with his Friendship, which he protested was more at my Devotion than at his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Confidentia</hi> here Tutor'd my Eares with a soft whisper, and bad me loose no Trust upon that Old <hi>Fox,</hi> for I could never hope to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it again.</p>
               <p>He takes you quoth she for a green <hi>Goose</hi> presented as a Rarity unto some Noble mans Table: and fearing least from thence you might be preferred unto a more Princely Mess, he labors to undermine your Designes with his scraping Friendship that so without suspect, he may at his leasure blow you up.</p>
               <p>I had been formerly Informed likewise of his double Heart and how his malitious sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties run all upon such <hi>Aenigmata,</hi> that young Novices must maintain their <hi>Oedipus</hi> to understand him.</p>
               <p>Very Jealous therefore of his proferred Courtesies (which to me did little better then stink) and finding his name a Traitor to his promises: I resolved to trust him no farther than his Lodgings. Yet that I might bring him on to his purpose, and better my Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50532:89"/>
by making him a Copy of my future Practise, I desembled for Company, and began to reveal unto him as private Secrets, things, God he knows, but then born: to which he so seriously listned, that me thought I already saw his Malice promise him, that he had Theory enough to Practise my Ruine.</p>
               <p>I think, as Cunning as he was, I had made some sport with him, had not prevention checked my Design by the entrance of <hi>Signio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Iustitia, Signiora Amicitia, Signiora Fideltade,</hi> and <hi>Signiora Conscientia,</hi> all sweet young Ladyes of honour in this <hi>Cardai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Court, who as <hi>Confidentia</hi> told me had long before been corrupted (with the help of that Bawd <hi>Avaritia</hi>) by <hi>Don Ambitio</hi>: and now they were come in Visit to the young Lady <hi>Contessa Malitia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lady <hi>Amicitia</hi> did so overflow with winning graces, that I fell desperately in Love with her, and desir'd <hi>Signiora Confidentia</hi> (who by her former Confession I knew to be Embassatrice <hi>de Amore</hi>) to put me forward into her Friendship.</p>
               <p>But she desired me by no means not to take notice of her in that place, for <hi>Don Ambitio</hi> had turn'd her off to <hi>Count Odio,</hi> whom she began now to affect: although he abus'd her,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50532:90"/>
and kept her only to make his detested pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the more advantagious.</p>
               <p>This information, put Ice in my Mouth: for I knew too much of that crabbed count, to become his Rivall.</p>
               <p>Yet being now a Courtier, I thought my humor must aswell wait upon the Fashion, as my Clothes.</p>
               <p>Every one I saw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wore his Mistrisses Favor, otherwise no Courtier.</p>
               <p>Faith then a Mistriss I must upon too, and wear her Colours, though I had never yet spake to her.</p>

                  </gap>e I was in conceit that the Lady <hi>Iustitia</hi> was ready to cast her self away for me: for me thought she never look'd toward me but her Heart laboured to steal to me in a sigh.</p>
               <p>Knowing therefore how apt those tender-hearted Creatures were to precipitate in Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and searing lest she might condemn me of Cruelty (though for my part I would have given her leave to have hang'd me for a Kisse) to answer her silent Oratory, I began to return her sighs, and as neer as Fansie could imitate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I framed such looks withall, as she might call pityfull.</p>
               <p>Then I call'd <hi>Signiora Confidentia</hi> apart, and told her what passages had hapned, and

                  </gap>ow the Lady <hi>Iustitia</hi> made love to me.</p>
               <p>The Jeering slut burst into such a Laughter at my mistake that all the Ladies took notice of it; and desired to be brought into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort, by participating of the Jest. But <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia</hi> to save her Credit and mine conceal'd it. And then told me that hereafter in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Ladyes she would not stand so near me, lest too much Confidence might make me Ridiculous. And then said that those sighs and sorrowfull looks of the Lady <hi>Iustitia,</hi> which I applied to my self, were for those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juryes. Perjuryes, Contempts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neglects, Brybes, Partialities, and a thousand such like abuses which the world dayly cast into her teeth; which makes the poor Lady so slighted and low-priz'd of every Man, that growing Dull and Melancholy, she lives so retir'd, that we can hardly see her above once a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>This mistake therefore made <hi>Confidentia</hi> retire farther from me: insomuch that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came so overwise ever after, that when a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man look'd or smil'd upon me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I thought she jeer'd at some defect: which mistrust made many pretty passages happen between me and the Lady <hi>Conscientia,</hi> for she had a minde to me in good earnest: as it after appeared
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50532:91"/>
by her fondness, and tenderness of me: who blushed not to cast her self into my Brest; prick me with her bodkin, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press her desires in <hi>Hieragliphicks:</hi> rouse me, kiss me, and often put me to the start with her secret motions. All which I regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, suspecting still that it was but a plot of hers to betray my weakness.</p>
               <p>When ever she came neer me therefore, I told her plainly she troubled me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that she made all the world take notice of her bad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: bad her go and accompany the Lady <hi>Iustitia</hi> who was Melancholly, and had the Green sickness for want of Exercise, for my part I would not be guilty of her loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>This Lady <hi>Conscientia,</hi> became so desperate upon my checking her: that stealing from us she ran out of the Court-Gate and threw her self into the Lake of Passion, where she perished.</p>
               <p>It was a long time before any of us mist her: so that had not the Lady <hi>Penitentia</hi> came in laughing and crying both at a breath and told us that <hi>Conscientia</hi> had drowned her self, none had ever taken notice of it.</p>
               <p>Here I observed what alteration this news
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50532:91"/>
would beget, and I found it almost impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, producing no other issue but a few abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Tears, which were delivered by a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manish Consent who like so many <hi>Ducks,</hi> if one cry the whole brood answers.</p>
               <p>And those showres were suddenly drunk up by the Sun of Gladness. For in came <hi>Don</hi>

               <p>The Jest was to hear every one laugh, and non able to satisfie Reason with the Cause: only all confessed that they felt their Hearts of a sudden much lightned, and a free inclination invited them to any thing that might give them delight.</p>
               <p>Well, the Laugh being ended, <hi>Don Zara</hi> with a cheerfull countenance, ruddy as the <hi>Aurora,</hi> step'd to the Ladyes and thank'd them for the honour they did him in entring into his Consort: then bad them proceed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, sing, dance, and make no more scruple of honest mirth, but to be free and open in all their delights, without suspect of any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture repentance; for that <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I presently took my Advantage of this good news<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and began to renew my Sute to the Lady <hi>Iustitia,</hi> who before had deceived me with the Melancholy of her Conscious Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousyes: Now I presumed she would make no scruple of playing false with any man: wherefore I made the less doubt in Corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her.</p>

               <p>WHilst the Lady <hi>Laetitia</hi> exercised her Voice: I prostrated my self (as the Custom is at all Masques in their Parts) on my Knees, at my Lady Mistris <hi>Iustitias</hi> feet. Where with a feeling Oratory I made my case known unto her: told her, her Eyes were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers: and I desired Justice.</p>
               <p>The richness of my Present made her take the better notice of me; besides I found her Disposition very corruptible. So that having brought her Just upon the point of a Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Promise: the Sonnet being ended, we were forced to break up our Session: every one fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his Posture, and then by mutuall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations we begat a <hi>Ballo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How every Man governed his heels I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to your Fancyes: since every Mans Heart was freed from the heavy clog of <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, our Masque ended I renewed my sute again with that hard Hearted Mistris of mine <hi>Iustitia:</hi> who in that little time, had dashed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50532:95"/>
me out of her Memory, acknowledging nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther me nor Present.</p>
               <p>Here I cal'd my old <hi>Chamerada Confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia:</hi> who presently assur'd me that there was no trusting to that Lady above all the rest. For said she; she is one of <hi>Don Ambitio's</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Concubines, whom he first Corrupted, and made her one Day by false Witnesses at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach that Noble Lord <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And now having served his turn, he hath cast her off, leaving her to her self: who now makes a Trade of her Necessity, and will lye with any Man for his Mony.</p>
               <p>When I heard this, I began to wish for my Presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50532:96"/>
a Bed, there wants not Coverings.</p>
               <p>I laughed to hear her so confident in her loosenesse. And to Bed we went without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceremonies.</p>
               <p>In the Morning I stole from her before she waked (lest I should be made pay for my Nights Rest) and going towards the Court-Gate, I met the <hi>Spenditore</hi> and the Master Cook going to the Market to buy provision for the <hi>Cardiacall</hi> Prince <hi>Spiritus Vitalis.</hi>

               <p>If any of you Gentlemen have a liking to any of these Dishes, (the worst of which may be served to a Princes Table) pray fall to whilest they are before you; and when those are digested, who ever desires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make use of them at Home for his Private Family, let him retire to any of our <hi>Spagiricall</hi> Kitchings, and you shall find our Cooks more open Hearted than those of the <hi>Cardiacall</hi> Princes; and freely present you all their Art in such <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticall</hi> Delicacyes. In the mean time I am sorry my cheer is not answerable to your Merits. What you want In meat; I desire you to satisfie with Mirth: For so believe me you shall be Heartily Wellcome.</p>
