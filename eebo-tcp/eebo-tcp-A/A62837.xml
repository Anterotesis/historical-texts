            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
TO
Mr. William Cowper, Surgeon;
ABOUT
An Effectual Method for Curing all
Scrophulous Diseases, commonly called
the KING'S-EVIL.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU will doubtless agree with the rest of the
World, that among all the Diseases within the
Sphere of Physick and Chirurgery, there is not
one in which Physicians and Chirurgeons have
taken more Pains, and have had less Success than
in Curing the King's Evil: For this Disease hath been hitherto
reckon<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d by Natural Means so Uncurable, that it was thought
nothing but a Supernatural Vertue granted to Kings from
Heaven could entirely Cure it, by laying their Hands upon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59007:3"/>
the Scrophulous Persons; It doth not belong to me to dispute
whether even the Hands of Monarchs can Cure this Stubborn
Distemper, but I am convinced by several Experiences, as
you your self and Hundreds of other People in this City
know very well, that Mr. <hi>Timothy Beaghan,</hi> killed of late at
the <hi>Five Bells</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> had almost an effectual
Method to Cure this Disease; which was a Diet Drink and
Pills, with the Manual Operation when there was room for
Surgery in the Case. This Secret I have my self now, and
do intend to make the same use of it as he did, knowing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
that it hath and will have the same Effect: but to
convince your self and the rest of the World of the Efficacy
of these Medicines, and of the Certainty that they are in
my Possession, I thought it necessary to acquaint you how Mr.
<hi>Beaghan</hi> himself got it, how he came into Reputation and
Practice, what remarkable Cures he hath performed, and
how he came to communicate his Secret to me.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Beaghan</hi> was bred a Soldier, and was for several Years
heretofore a Sergeant in the Earl of <hi>Litchfeild</hi>'s Regiment,
wherein he lost his Leg, for which he carried a wooden Leg;
His Wife had this Secret first, and she lived of it; Dr. <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neck,</hi>
of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> lately deceased, recommended her to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Persons Infected with the <hi>King's-Evil;</hi> she did work
great Cures, and died about Nine Years ago, and left her
Secret to her Husband. Mr. <hi>Beaghan</hi> being disabled, and
made incapable to serve by the loss of one of his Legs, and
being consequently reduced to great Extremities, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to make use of this Secret for his Livelihood; But
having no Experience in the Secret, no Skill in Medicines,
nor in their Preparations, and not knowing by sight the very
Drugs he was to make use of, and being besides too poor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59007:3"/>
and despicable to be believed, or to be thought capable to
Cure such intricate Diseases; he came to me about Seven
Years ago, and acquainted me of the Misery he was in, and
of the goodness of his Secret; he desired me, since he could
not be Credited himself, to recommend him to any Persons,
Rich or Poor, that had the <hi>King's-Evil,</hi> and he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
Cure them, for any Gratuity they would be pleased
to give him. Suspecting the good Success he promised with
such assurance, I was very backward and cautious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
him to any of my Acquaintance, for fear by any
ill Management I should be blamed, and reflected upon for
recommending a Man so illiterate; knowing besides that
most Secrets are violent Medicines, which disturb the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and disorder the whole Oeconomy of the Body:
Notwithstanding, pitying the poor Man's Condition, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
him if he shewed me his Receipt, and if I found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it Pernicious, I would do him all the Service I could
(my own Reputation being safe;) And I assured him at the
same time, that I would not whilst he lived make any use
of his Secret my self, nor disclose the same to any Body
else. And accordingly he shewed me his Receipt of the
Pills and Diet Drink, of which I took a Copy, and finding
nothing in them dangerous, but rather a very exact Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of wholesom Ingredients, I recommended him to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral;
I bought the Drugs for him, and put him into a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
little expecting the wonderful Effects which those
Medicines wrought afterwards; for I was surprized to see
Ulcers and Fistula's healed, most obstinate Tumours dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
the Mass of Blood sweetned and rectified, corroded
Bones cleansed and made sound, little Scrophulous Children,
all Emaciated and at Death's door, miraculously Recovered,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59007:4"/>
and such Incredible Cures performed of the <hi>King's-Evil,</hi> that
this poor Soldier got in a small time a vast Reputation, as
well as a great deal of Money, and the People stiled him
Doctor. And to satisfie you that he hath done unexpected
things, I thought fit to let you know the Names of some
of the Persons he Cured of the <hi>King's-Evil,</hi> as Mrs <hi>Lowfield</hi>
on <hi>Ludgate-Hill,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bridger</hi>'s Daughter and Son in <hi>Durham-Yard,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Hornby</hi>'s Child in <hi>Lombard street,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> of
<hi>Worcestershire,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goulding</hi>'s Child of <hi>Clare-Market,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s
Daughter of <hi>London,</hi> My Lord <hi>Dundonnell</hi> the Earl of
<hi>Arran</hi>'s Nephew, Sir <hi>Michael Cole</hi>'s Child in <hi>Pallmall,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Dewy</hi> of <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and many others, which would be too
tedious to relate. Since therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> Mr. <hi>Beaghan</hi> is now
Dead, and since I was instrumental to bring him into Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and did him no Prejudice while he lived, I think I
have Reason enough and Right to turn this Secret commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to me to my own Advantage, as well as to that of
the Publick; yet that the College of Physicians, for which
I have a great deal of Respect and Veneration, should not
think that I intend to do more than becomes an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary
of the Hall, I thought it necessary to communicate
this Secret to some Discreet and Skilful Doctor of the said
College, that would have Judgment enough not only to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
safely these Medicines in all the dangerous Symptoms
of the <hi>King's-Evil,</hi> but likewise to improve it further for
the Benefit of the Publick; Wherefore Doctor <hi>Connor,</hi>
Fellow of the Royal Society, and one of the College of
Physicians, being an expert Anatomist, and well versed in
Medicines, and in the Practice of Physick, and having Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
my self of his Skill in Curing often Intricate Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
I have communicated this Secret to him, and desired
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59007:4"/>
him to appear in it; He liked mightily the Ingredients, the
nice Proportion, and the exact Composition of the Pills and
Diet-Drink; but he desired, before he would appear, to
be further convinced that these were the very same, and the
only Ingredients the Deceased made use of; Wherefore, to
satisfie the Doctor, I went to Mr. <hi>Head,</hi> a Druggist in the
<hi>Strand,</hi> near <hi>Bull-Inn-Court,</hi> who was the only Person Mr.
<hi>Beaghan</hi> bought his Drugs of these several Years; and
Mr. <hi>Head</hi> will justifie that the Drugs in my Receipt are the
very same which Mr. <hi>Beaghan</hi> used to buy of him, and I my
self have a Note under Mr. <hi>Beaghan</hi>'s Hand to confirm the
same: To convince the Doctor further, I made some Bottles
of the Diet Drink, and sent them to some of Mr. <hi>Beaghan</hi>'s
Patients, namely to Mrs <hi>Lowfield,</hi> who Certifies it hath the
same Taste and the same Effect with her as it used to have
in the Deceased's life time. The Doctor also drank a Bottle
thereof, and I drank another my self, and we found it very
agreable. Seeing therefore it is undeniable and certain,
both by Experience and Reason, that this was the very
same Method the Deceased followed in Curing the <hi>King's-Evil,</hi>
I thought fit in this Letter to acquaint the Publick as
well as your self, that all Persons Infested with the <hi>King's-Evil,</hi>
may repair to Doctor <hi>Connor</hi> in <hi>Bowstreet</hi> for his Advice,
for I will do nothing without his Direction in those intricate
Scrophulous Diseases, he being a proper Judge of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Constitutions of Mankind; also when convenient to
to call in a Chirurgeon for outward Applications: For my
part I will make it my Business, that what relates to me, I
mean the making up of the Medicines thus prescribed, shall
be performed with such Care and Watchfulness as will be for
the Doctor's Reputation and mine, as well as for the Benefit
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59007:5"/>
of the Publick. Excuse, <hi>Sir,</hi> my Trouble and Tediousness,
and believe me,</p>
