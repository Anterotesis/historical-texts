            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S to the ornament of the ayre belongeth birds and foules, (as <hi>Beda</hi> ſaith) which I meane in this Treatiſe to ſet forth. Birds be called <hi>Aues,</hi> as it were deuide without way: (as <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith) for their waies in the ayre are not diſtinguiſhed in certaine, and birds with moouing of their wings deuide and depart the ayre: but anone after the flight, the ayre cloſeth it ſelfe, and leaueth no ſigne or token of their paſſage and flight. And foules be called <hi>Volucres,</hi> and haue that name of <hi>Volary</hi> to fligh: for birds fligh with winges, (as <hi>Iſodore</hi> ſayth) and therefore they bée called <hi>Alites,</hi> as it were <hi>Alates:</hi> that is, moouing and rearing vp themſelues with winges: for they fligh not without winges, nor arere themſelues from the earth vp into the ayre without the benefite of their wings: or els a bird is called <hi>Ales,</hi> and hath that name of <hi>Alendo,</hi> fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: for hée is fedde of himſelfe that feedeth birds and foules of heauen, and giueth meate to all fleſh. (as <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſayth.)</p>
                  <p>The condition and properties of birdes bee knowne by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers thinges, by their ſubſtance and complexion: for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of birds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and foules bée made of two middle Elements that bée betwéene the two Elements that be moſt heauie and moſt light: for in their compoſitions and making, ayre and water hath moſt maſtrie? and therfore they haue leſſe of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heauens, and more of lightneſſe of the ayre then beaſts that goe on land and ſwim on water. By lightneſſe of the ſubſtance
<pb facs="tcp:12759:31"/>
they be borne vp into the ayre, (as <hi>Iſidore</hi> ſayth) and the ayre that is cloſed in the hallownes of pennes and feathers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a bird light, and diſpoſeth and maketh him able and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth him to mooue vpward. Alſo the condition of birds is kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen by generation, for they haue a feminall vertue of kinde plight in them, and by vertue thereof they bée kindly mooued to increaſe their kind by deed of generation, and to keepe their kinde in order: As it is ſayd of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> all birdes (ſayth hée) and foules when they bring foorth birds lay Egges, though it cannot bée ſéene in all for ſcarcitie: and the beginning of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of a birde, as it is ſayd, it commeth of the white, and his meate is the yolke: and after ten daies of the generation a bird is full ſhapen in all parts, and the parts bée openly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed and knowne, but then his head is greater then all his bodie: and if the Egge ſhell were then broken, the head ſhould bée found bowed vpon the right thigh, and his winges ſpread vpon the head.</p>
                  <p>When the generation of all the members is perfectly made, and liniation and ſhape of the members, the ſhell brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſometime the eightéenth day, or the twentieth day, as it fareth in Hennes, and then the Chickins come out of the ſhell aliue, being full ſhapt, and ſometime twaine out of one ſhell. Among all beaſtes that bée in order of generation, birdes and Foules bée moſt honeſt of kinde: for by order of kind, Males ſeeke Females with buſineſſe, and loue them when they bée found, and fight, and put them in perill for them, and bée ioined to them onely as it were by couenant and wedding, loue and nouriſh, and feed onely the birds that they get, and ſo kindlie they deeme and knowe betwéene ſexe and ſexe, male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, except fewe, (whom kind goeth out of kind) as <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> ſheweth an example of the Partredge, that forgetteth his ſexe, that is, to vnderſtand the diſſolution of male and female, and ſo hee ſaith, that the male leapeth vpon the male, and the female vpon the female. But of the Egges that come of ſuch treading, come no Birdes, but they bee as wind Egges, and
<pb facs="tcp:12759:31"/>
take an euill ſauor of ſuch treading, and an euill ſtinch. And Birds and Foules ingendering kéepe couenable time, for in ſpring time when the generation commeth in, birds crie and ſing, males draw to company of females, and deſire each other of loue, and woo with beakes and voice, and build Neſts, and lay Egges, and bring forth birds, and when the birds bée gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, they feede and nouriſh them, and bring them vp, but when the office of generation is full ended, then they ceaſe of ſong, and depart from each other, and come not together till the time of generation commeth againe.</p>
                  <p>Alſo birds and foules bee knowen by the places that they dwell in, for ſome birds and foules as me ſéemeth, loue compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and dwelleth nigh men, as Hennes, Geeſe, Sparrowes, Storkes and Swallowes, and ſome dread and fligh, and bée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide of conuerſation of men, as foules of woods, of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and marries, for by their diuers complexious, they ſeeke and challenge diuers maners of places to inhabite in.</p>
                  <p>As we may ſée in our owne country of England, ſome foules vſe ſome ſheires more then other ſome, and in ſome ſheires there come none of ſome Foules at all, as they doe in other ſheires. For thoſe that bée cold and moiſt of kinde vſe marriſh and riuers for gathering of meate, and making of Neſtes for ſitting abroade, and for to bring vp and nouriſh their yoong Birds: and Foules that bée of more hot and drie kind, dwell on Mountaines and on high Rockes and ſtones, as Birdes and Foules that liue by pray: as Eagles and Faulkons, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch, to the which, kind giueth crooked Clawes and ſtrong féet.</p>
                  <p>Alſo ſome wood foules vſe and dwell in Woods and thicke tops of trees, and ſome of thoſe bee more mild then other, as Birds that ſing in ſommer time with ſwéete notes in woods and trées.</p>
                  <p>And other birds there bée that liue onely in fields, and vſe to bée therein, and get their meate, and eate continually of the fruit of the earth, as Cranes and Geeſe both wilde and tame,
<pb facs="tcp:12759:32"/>
and ſuch foules loue to dwell together, both on the grounde and on the ayre, and goe and flie together in heards, and leaue their owne kind, and make a King among them.</p>
                  <p>Séeing I haue declared the nature and propertie of foules in the ayre, I thought good to ſet downe ſome rules belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Fouling, to helpe to further ſome in that practiſe, which woulde faine learne and hath no teacher: which both to the pleaſuring of them and ſmall labour of my ſelfe, I haue done my good will.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of fouling with Limetwigges, and how we ſhould ſet our Limetwigs for ſortes of Foule. You muſt chuſe Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twigs of thoſe twigges that grow on the bodie of the trée, and not of no bow twigs, for that they bée britell and will not hold, but will ſnap a two, but the twigges that grow on the body of the trée are young bending twigges, and you muſt haue to your whole ſet a thouſand iuſt: there is alſo diuers other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of fouling, as with Nets, Springes, baites and ſnares, with diuers others. But to ſpeake firſt of fouling with Lime<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twigges, as ſome are ſet lowe and ſome high, and that is as wee knowe the haunt of the foule that vſes to that place, whether they bee Geeſe, Duckes, Sknipes, or Hearnes, or Craines, or any other maner of foule that vſes to the place that you ſet your Limerods in. If you ſet your Roddes for Wilde Geeſe, you muſt ſticke them in a manner vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and halfe a yard aſunder, which is almoſt narrow e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a Sknipe: but if you ſhould ſticke them anie clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, there would no foule venture at all, for the wilde Gooſe is the ſuttleſt foule of any, for when ſhee lighteth, ſhee lighteth moſt commonlie in the deepeſt waters for feare of deceit, and if ſhee come out of the water to come to land, ſhee will ſpie to ſee if ſhee can ſpie anie thing before her: if ſhée ſpie any thing ſhée will into the water againe: but euer when you ſticke your Roddes, ſticke them ſo that the tailes of your Rods may bee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the water, (if you ſticke them by any Riuer ſide) and the heads of your Roddes ſcooping from the Riuer, that the foule
<pb facs="tcp:12759:32"/>
may come with the Rods: for there is no foule that will come againſt the Rods, nor is not able almoſt if they would: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Rods turned from the Riuer, they will bée the bolder to goe onwards, and then they can no way eſcape. And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſet your Roddes about the whole plat that you ſet, with their tayles outward, and their heads ſtooping inward, for the foule will bée the bolder to goe amongſt your Roddes, if they chaunce to light beſide them: but you muſt giue good atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vpon your Rods, leaſt that the foule which is tangled doe picke themſelues and get away againe, but you muſt lie verie cloſe leaſt that the foule doe chaunce to ſpie you: but if it bee ſomewhat darkiſh that you cannot eſpie whether there bee anie foule lighted among your Roddes, then goe to your Roddes and giue aſhue, and if that there bée anie they will flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtraight and fligh vpward: and if that there bee none, then take your ſtaffe and beat the Riuers and Lakes within halfe a mile compaſſe once or twiſe, if you be able to compaſſe it, or more, and then ſhall you haue them reſorte to you Limerods very thicke: for hée that mindes to catch any, muſt ſo trauell that hee leaue no Lakes or Springes vnſearched, and ſée that your Limerods bee ſet ſome what lowe round about at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry entring, for that is good for all manner of foule: but if that they bee ſet high within, it is good reaſon that the foule doth ſhut her winges before ſhee is altogether at the ground, and ſee that you doe ſet your Roddes within one another about three quarters or halfe a yarde aſunder almoſt: and if it freeſe hard, you muſt trim them with a little new Lime and Gooſe greace mingled together, and that will kéepe them long from free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. And if there bee anie ſpeciall place which foules doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to, as in deepe waters and running Riuers, and that the Riuer is deepe that you cannot ſet your Roddes in, then take a pole or a cord, and a long hay rope that will winde round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the length of the pole, then take your Limerods and ſticke them verie thicke and looſe withall, and then lay your pole or poles ouer the Riuer, and thruſt the end of your pole within
<pb facs="tcp:12759:33"/>
the bancke, and tye the other ende of you pole next to you to the bancke ſide, and ſee that your pole bée a pretie way within the water, and that the heads of your Rods doe ſtand cloſe to the water: and thus may you ſet as many poles or cordes as you thinke the place doth deſire, and ſticke your Roddes verie looſely that they may goe with the foule as ſoone as they touch them.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Alſo there is another maner of way to catch in the water with ſmall cordes being tied ouerthwart the water, and lime them as you doe your Limerods with good water lime (as wée call it) though indéed it is but Birdlime, but it is tempered to holde within the water, which if you let the cordes bée but a little within the water that it may ſcarce couer it: and if the water bee broad, then take a Corke or two and tie them to your Line to holde it vp. This is a pretie way and not to be ſuſpected.</p>

                     <p>ALſo there is another manner of way to foule which is with Nets, but the vſe of them is in the night, and the darkeſt night the better: and firſt of fouling with Nets, which wée call in England moſt commonly Birdbaiting, and ſome call it lowbelling, and the vſe of it is to goe with a great light of Creſſets, or ragges of linnen dipt in Tailow that will make
<pb facs="tcp:12759:34"/>
a good light, and you muſt haue a panne of plate made like a Lanterne to carrie your light in, which muſt haue a great ſoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket to holde a great light, and carrie it before you on your breaſt with a Bell in your other hande of a great bigneſſe, made in manner like to a Cowbel, but of greater bigneſſe, and you muſt ring it alwaies after one order, with two to goe with Nettes one of each ſide of him that carries the Bell, and what with the light that ſo doth amaſe them, and the Bell that ſo dooth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh them, they will when you come neare them turne vp their white bellies, which you ſhall quicklie perceiue, then lay your Nets on them and take them: but the Bell muſt not ſtint going: for if it ceaſe, then the Birds wil flie vp if they heare anie more nigh. This is a good way to catch Larkes, Woodcockes, and Partriches, and all other land birds,</p>

                     <p>TO goe a trameling with a Net it is a good way, for two may goe abroad with a Tramell and catch ſtore. You muſt haue your Nette ſeauen yardes of length, and fiue in breadth, then take a couple of Poules or long roddes, ſo long as your Net is, and tie your poles to your Nettes all along the length of your Nettes, one of one ſide, and the other of the other ſide, then may you take your poule in your hand, and plucke out your poule out of breadth, and one goe in one thorow of the land and another in the other thorowe, and goe along in lands and carrie your Nette as farre forwards as you can, and when they heare you tread, then will they flutter vp into your Nette, which you ſhall quickly heare, then let downe your Nette to the ground, and gripe them, and take them from vnder your Nette, but if it be in a verie darke night, that you cannot ſee them, you ſhould haue a little cloaſe Lanterne, that one may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no light, but when it is opened to ſée to take them, but wée commonly make ſhift without.</p>

                  <head>A briefe Treatiſe of Fiſhing, with the <hi>Arte of Angling: wherein is conteined the</hi> perfect making of all manner of Implements appertaining to that exerciſe: The diuers and ſeuerall baites for euery kind of fiſh, with the beſt times of the yeere for the taking of them.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the wiſe man ſaith, a good ſpirit maketh a merie and flouriſhing age, and cauſeth a man to liue long: and truly in my opinion, theſe thrée thinges are a medeſine, and a preſeruation for the ſame. The firſt of them is, a merry thought. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, labour not outragious. The third is, diet meaſurable. The firſt, if a man will euermore bée in a merry thought, and haue a glad ſpirit, hée muſt eſchewe all contrarious companie, and all places of debate, where hee may haue anie occaſion of melancholie, and hee muſt eſchewe all places of Ryot, which is occaſion of ſurfit and ſickneſſe, and hee muſt drawe him to places of ſweete ayre, and eate nouriſhing meates and delectable.</p>
                  <p>As nowe I meane to deſcriue theſe diſportes and games, to finde the beſt of them as truely as I could, and although the right Noble and worthie Duke of Yorke, late maiſter of the game, hath deſcribed this arte of Fiſhing, and the reſt of theſe pleaſures and diſportes. For hunting in myne opinion is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourſome, for the Huntſman muſt follow his hounds, ſweating full ſore, hee bloweth till his lips bliſter, and when hée thinkes hee hath a Hare, full oft it is a Hedgehog. Thus hée chaſeth vp and downe, and knoweth not ſometimes at what. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth home at night rayne beaten and pricked, and his clothes torne all to peeces, wetſhod and all myrie, and ſome of his
<pb facs="tcp:12759:37"/>
hounds loſt, and ſome ſurbated. Such griefes and manie other happen vnto the Huntſmen, which for diſpleaſing of them that loue it I dare not report: thus truely mee thinketh it is not the beſt game and diſport of the foure.</p>
                  <p>Hawking is labourous and troubelous: for as often the Faulkner loſeth his Hawkes, as the Hunter his Houndes, then is his game and diſport gone, yea, and full often hee crieth and whiſtleth, till he almoſt loſeth his wind, his Hawke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time taketh aboue, and giueth no minde nor ſight to him: for when hee would haue her flie, then ſhee will bathe: with miſfée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhee will haue the frounce, and many other diſeaſes that bringeth to ſouce. Thus by proofe, this is not the beſt diſport and game of the ſayd foure. In my opinion the game of Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is the ſimpleſt: for in Winter in cold weather, the Fouler can doe no good, but in the hardeſt and coldeſt weather, which is greeuous: for when he would goe to his ginnes, hee cannot for colde: manie a deuiſe hee maketh, and yet in the morning his fortune is hard, when hee is wet vp to the waſte. Manie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities I could ſhewe, but for offending I let them paſſe. Then ſith it is ſo, that Hawking, Hunting, and Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bee ſo laborous, that none of them may bee a meane to a merrie ſpirit, which is the cauſe of long life, vnto the ſayings of the wiſe in his Parables: doubtleſſe then it muſt followe, that fiſhing with the Angle is moſt delectable, for all other are troubleſome and laberous: For in ſome kinde of fiſhing it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Fiſher through wet and ſo colde, that many and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times there inſueth diuers infirmities through the ſame: But the Angler hee hath no colde, no diſeaſe, no impediment, except it bee through himſelfe: for hee can loſe but a Line or a Hooke at the moſt, which hee may make againe at his owne leiſure, as he ſhall be taught hereafter: So then is not his loſſe greeuous if the fiſh breake away with his Hooke, that is the moſt: for and he faile of one, hee hitteth of another: and if hee quite faile, yet hee hath his wholeſome walkes, his pleaſant ſhades, the ſweete ayre, the excellent ſmelles of the ſweete
<pb facs="tcp:12759:37"/>
Medowe flowers, which maketh him hungrie: hee heareth the melodious Harmonie of Birdes and other Foules, which hee thinketh is better then the noiſe of Hounds, the blaſt of Horns, or all the cry that Hunters, Faulkners, or Foulers can make: and if the Angler doe take fiſh, then hath hée a mercy ſpirit, and a glad heart. But who ſo will vſe this exerciſe, hee muſt riſe carely, which is profitable to man for the health of his bodie: For as the olde Engliſh Prouerbe is, who ſo dooth riſe carely ſhall be holie, healthie, and happie. Thus I haue ſhewed in this Treatiſe, that this diſport and game of Angling, is the very meane to induce a man to a merrie ſpirit. And to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of all thoſe that haue delight in theſe exerciſes, I haue col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this Treatiſe following, which you may vſe at your pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>IF you will bee perfite in this art of Angling, you muſt firſt learne to make your Implements: that is to ſay, your Rod, and your Lines of diuers colours: This done, you muſt know how you muſt angle, and in what place of the water, how déep, and at what time of the day, and for what maner of Fiſh, and what weather, how many impediments there be in fiſhing, and ſpeciallie in Angling, and what baite belongeth to euerie fiſh euerie time of the yeare: And how you ſhall make your baites breede, where you ſhall finde them, and how you ſhall keepe them for the moſt part: How you ſhall make your Hookes of Steele, and of Oſmonde, ſome for the Dub, ſome for the Flote, and for the ground. And here I will teach you how you ſhall make your Rod: you ſhall cut it betweene Michalmas and Candlemas, of an ell and a halfe long, beeing the arme of a great Haſell, Willow, or Aſpe, and beth him in a whote Ouen, and ſet it euen and ſtraight, and let it cole a moneth, then take a corde and bind it faſt about, and binde it to a fourme or to a peece of ſquare timber: then take a Plummers wyer that is euen and ſtreight, and ſharpe the one ende and heate it in the fire and Charcole, and burne the hole quite through in the pith,
<pb facs="tcp:12759:38"/>
beginning at both endes and goe on too the middle: you may burne the hole with a Bird broch, but let the laſt broch bée big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then any of them before, then let it lie and coole two daies, vnbinde it and let it lie in the ſmoke, or the roufe of a houſe, till it bee through drie. In the ſame ſeaſon cut a yard of greene Haſell, and beth it euen and ſtraigh, and let it drie with the ſtaffe: and when it is drie make it fit for the hole in the ſtaffe, vnto the halfe length of the ſtaffe: and to fill the other halfe of the crop, take a faire ſhute of Black thorne, Crab tree Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or els of Iuniper, cut in the ſame ſeaſon, and well bethed and ſtraight, and ſet them fit together, ſo that the crop may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all into the ſayde hole, then ſhaue your ſtaffe and make it Tapar wiſe, then hoope the ſtaffe at both endes with long hoopes of yron, or latten after the cleanlieſt maner, and a pike in the nether end faſtened with a running wyer to take in and out of your ſtaffe, and ſet your crop a handfull within your vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of your ſtaffe, in ſuch wiſe that it bee as biggethere as in anie other place aboue, then arme your ſtaffe downe to the fret with a Line of ſixe heares, and dubble the Line and fret it faſt on with a peece of a bowe: And thus you ſhall make you a ſtaffe to walke with, and no man may knowe whether you haue ſuch Implements about you: It will bée very light and nimble to fiſh with at your pleaſure, and is alwaies very ready and neceſſarie.</p>
                  <p>AFter you haue thus made your Rod, you muſt learne to colour your Lines of heare after this manner. You muſt take of a white Horſe taile the longeſt heares you can get, and the bigger and rounder it is, the better it is, depart them in ſixe parts, and colour euery part by himſelfe in diuers colours: as yeallowe, greene, tawnie, browne, ruſſet, or duſkie colour: And for to make your heare take a good creene colour, you muſt take a quart of Ale, and put into it halfe a pound of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, and put your heare and all together in a little pan, and let them boyle ſofly halfe an hower, then take out your heare
<pb facs="tcp:12759:38"/>
and let them drie, then take a pottle of faire water, and put it into a pan, and two handfulles of Wexen, and preſſe it with a Tyle ſtone, and let it boyle ſoftly the ſpace of an hower: and when it is yeallowe on the ſkumme, put therein your heares, with halfe a pound of Copperous beaten into powder, and let it boyle the ſpace of going of halfe a mile, and then ſet it downe and let it coole the ſpace of fiue or ſixe howers, then take out the heare and drie it, and it will bée the beſt greene for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that can bee, and the more that you put of Copperous to it the better it will be.</p>

                     <head>For to make your heare yeallowe.</head>
                     <p>DReſſe it as before with Allom, and after with Oldes, or Waxen, with Copperous or Verdigreace.</p>

                     <p>TAke a pottle of ſmall Ale, and ſtampe thereinto three hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulles of Walnut leaues, and put it together, and then put in your heare that it be as déepe as you will haue it.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>To make your heare browne.</head>

                     <head>For to make a tawny colour.</head>
                     <p>TAke Lime and water, and put them together, and then put your heares therein foure or fiue houres, then take them out, and put them into a Tanners Oſe one day, and it will be as fine a tawny colour as can be for your purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſixt part of your heare, you ſhall keepe ſtill white for
<pb facs="tcp:12759:39"/>
lines, for the double hooke to fiſh for the Trout, &amp; for ſmall lines to lie for the Roche and the Dace.</p>
                     <p>When your heare is thus collected, you muſt knowe for which waters and which ſeaſons they ſhall ſerue, the greene cullour for all cleare waters from Aprill vntill September. The yellowe cullour in euery cleare water from September to Nouember. For it is like the Weedes and other kinde of graſſe that is broken in the Riuer. The ruſſet cullour ſerueth all the Winter vntill the ende of Aprill, as well in Riuers as in Pooles or lakes.</p>
                     <p>The browne cullour ſerueth for the water that is blackiſh, in Riuers or other waters: the tawny cullours, for thoſe riuers or waters that be heathy or moriſh.</p>
                     <p>Now you muſt make your lines after this order. Firſt you muſt haue an inſcrument for the twiſting of your line. Take your heare and cut off a handfull at the ende, becauſe it is not ſtrong enough, then turne the top to the tayle ouer each alike, and make it into three parts, and knit euerie part by himſelfe, and knit the other end altogether: then put that end faſt into your inſtrument into the clift, and make it faſt with a wedge, fower fingers ſhorter then your heare, then twine your warpe one way alike, and faſten them in three cliftes alike ſtraight, then take that out at the other end, and let it twine that way that it deſireth, then ſtreine it a little, and knit it for vndoing, and that is good.</p>
                     <p>So when you haue ſo manie links as will ſuffice for a line to make it long enough, then muſt you knit them together with a water knot, or a Dutch knot, and when your knot is knit, cut of the voyde ſhore endes a ſtrawe breadth from the knot, thus ſhall your lines be fayre and euen: and alſo ſure for any maner of Fiſh.</p>
                     <p>The fineſt practiſe is in making your hockes, and for the making of them you may haue your ſeuerall kinde of tooles that you may doe them artificiallie. A ſemy clam of yron, a bendor, a payre of long and ſmall tongues, and a knife ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb facs="tcp:12759:39"/>
hard and thicke, an Anuild, and a little hammer.</p>
                     <p>And for a ſmall Fiſh you ſhall take the ſmalleſt quarrell Needles that you can find of Steele: and you ſhall put the Quarrell in a fyre of Charcole till it bee of the ſame cullour that the fire is, then take it out and lay it to coole, and you ſhall find it well alayd to file, then rayſe the beard with your knife, and make the poynt ſharpe, then alay him againe or elſe hee will breake in the bending, then bend him as hée will ſerue for your purpoſe, you ſhall make them of great Needles, as ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers Needles, Taylers needles, or imbroderers Needles: but looke that they will bowe at the point or els they bee not good, and when you haue beaten flat the end of the hooke, fyle him ſmooth that it fret not the line, the put it into the fire, and giue it an eaſie red heat, then ſuddainly quench it in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and it will bée hard and ſtrong. And for to haue knowledge of your Inſtruments that bee neceſſarie, without the which you are not able to accompliſh your deſire, that is, your Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Knife, Pynſon, Claem, Wedge, File, Wreſt, and a Needle.</p>
                     <p>When you haue made your hookes, then you muſt ſet them on according to their ſtrength and greatneſſe. Firſt take ſmall red ſilke, and if it bee for a great hooke then double it and twiſt it, and for a ſmall hooke let it be ſingle, and therewith fret the line where as you will haue the hooke ſtand, a ſtrawe breadth, then ſet to your hooke and fret it with the ſame thred the two partes, of the length that it ſhall bee fret in all, and when you come to the third part, then turne the end of your line vp again double, to the other third part, then put your thred in at the hole twiſe or thriſe, and let it goe each time about the yeard of your hooke: then wette the hooke and drawe, and looke that your line lie euermore within your hookes, and not without, and then cut of the lines end, and the thred as nigh as you can, ſauing the fret.</p>
                     <p>So, yee knowe with how great Hookes you ſhall angle to euery fiſh, now I will tell with how many heares you ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:12759:40"/>
angle for euerie fiſh. Firſt for the Menowe with a line of one heare: For the waring Roche, the Bleake, the Gogion, and the Ruffe, with a line of three heares: For the Dace and the Roch, with a line of three heares: For the Pearch, the Floun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Bremet, with a line of foure heares: For the Cheuin, the Breame, the Tench, and the Eele, with ſixe heares: For the Troute, and the graſing Barble, and the great Cheuin, with nine heares: For the great Troute with twelue heares: For the Salmon, with fifteene heares: and for a Pyke with a chalke line made in the colour aforeſayd, armed with a line, as you ſhall heare hereafter. When I ſpeake of the Pyke, your Lines muſt bee plumed with lead, and the neareſt plumbe to the Hooke, bee a foote of at the leaſt, and euery plumbe of the quantitie of the bigneſſe of the line: There be thrée maner of plumbes, for a ground line, renning, and for the ſlote: ſet vpon the ground line lying, ten plumbs all ioyning together on the ground line, renning, nine or ten ſmall: the flote plumbe ſhall be heauie, that the firſt plucke of any fiſh may pull it into the water, and make your plumbes round and ſmooth, that they ſticke not on ſtones and wéedes.</p>
                     <p>THen you ſhall make your ſlotes in this manner. Take a peece of a Corke that is cleane without holes, and bore it through with a ſmall hote yron, and put thereinto a quill or pen euen and ſtraight: alwaies note that the greater the hole, the bigger the pen, and ſhape it great in the middeſt, and ſmall at both ends, and eſpeciallie ſharpe in the nether end, and make them ſmooth on a Grindſtone, and looke that the flote for one heare be no bigger then a Peas, for two hears as a Beame, for twelue heares as a Walnut, and ſo euery line muſt haue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his portion. Al maner of lines that be not for the ground, muſt haue flotes: &amp; the renning ground line muſt haue a flote, and the lying ground line muſt haue a flote.</p>
                     <p>NOw I haue taught you to make your heares, hereafter I meane to ſhewe you the art of Angling. You ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb facs="tcp:12759:40"/>
that there is ſixe manner of Anglings: the one is at the ground for the Troute, and other fiſh: another is at the ground at the Arch or ſtang where it ebbeth and floweth, for Bleake, Roch, and Dace: the third is with a flote for all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fiſh: the fourth, with a Menowe for the Troute without plumbe or flote: the fift is renning in the ſame for the Roche and Dace with two heares or one heare, and a flie: the fixt is a dubbed hocke for the Troute or Grayling. And for the firſt and principall poynt in Angling, looke that you keepe you from the ſight of the fiſh, either ſtande cloſe on the land, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde ſome buſh: for if hée ſée you, then your ſport is marde for he will not bite, and looke that you ſhadowe not the water as little as you can, for it is that which will make him be gone: for if the fiſh bée fraide hée will not bite a good while after. For all manner of fiſh that feede by grounde, you muſt angle for them to the bottome, ſo that your hooke ſhall runne and lie on the ground: and for all other fiſh that feedeth aboue, you ſhall angle for them at the middeſt of the water, or aboue the midſt, or belowe the middeſt whether ye will, for the greater the fiſh, the nearer he lieth to the bottome of the water, and euermore the ſmaller the fiſh, the more he ſwimmeth aboue. The third good poynt, is when the fiſh biteth, that you be not too haſtie to ſmite nor to take: for you muſt abide till the bayte bee farre in the mouth of the fiſh, and then tarrie no longer, and this is for the ground: and for the flote when you ſee it pulled into the water, or els caried ſoftly vpon the water, then ſmite, and looke that you neuer ouer-ſmite the ſtrength of your line for brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: And if it be your fortune to ſmite a great fiſh with a ſmal line, then you muſt leade him in the water, and labour him there till he bée drowned and ouercome, then take him as well as you can, and euer take heede that you ſtreyne him not ouer the ſtrength of your line, and as much as you can let him not goe paſt your lines ende from you, but keepe him euer vnder your Rod, and holde him as ſtreight as your line will ſuſtain, and beare his leapes and his plunges as well as you can with

                     <p>THere is no great diuerſitie in anie place of a Poole, ſo it bée deepe, for it is a priſon to all fiſhes, and therefore the ſooner taken: but in the Riuer the beſt angling is where it is deepe, and cleare by the ground, as grauell or clay without mud or weedes, and eſpecially if there bee any whirling in the water, or a couert, as a hollowe bancke or great rootes of Trees, or long weedes fleeting aboue the waters, where the fiſh may hide themſelues at certaine times when they liſt. Alſo it is good to angle in ſtiffe ſtreames, and alſo in vallies of waters, and in flood gates, and Mill pits, and at the bancke where the ſtreame runneth, and is deepe and cleare by the ground, and in any place where the fiſh haunt and haue any feeding.</p>
                     <p>Now you ſhall vnderſtand the beſt time of the yeere, and the beſt times of the day, from the beginning of May to Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember: the beſt time of their baiting is from foure a clocke in the morning vntill eight a clocke, and from foure in the after noone till eight at night: but it is not ſo good in the afternoone as in the morning: and if it bée a cold winde and a lowring day it is much better then a cleare day, and the Poole fiſhes will bite beſt in the morning.</p>
                     <p>And if you ſee at anie time of the day the Trout or the Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling leape, angle for him with a dub according to the ſeaſon of the yeare, and where the water ebbeth and floweth: the fiſh wil bite in ſome place at the ebbe, and in ſome place at the flood, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue had reſting behind Stanges and Arches of Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and other ſuch places.</p>
                     <p>The principall time to angle is in a lowring day, when the winde bloweth ſoftly: for in Summer when it is verie whote then it is naught: from September vntill Aprill in a fayre Sunnie day, it is very good angling, and if the winde at that
<pb facs="tcp:12759:41"/>
time haue anie parte of the Orient weather, then it is naught: and when it is a great winde &amp; that it ſnoweth, raineth, or hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, or is a great tempeſt, as Thunder or Lightning, or a ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hot weather, then it is naught for to angle.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall further vnderſtand that there be twelue empedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which cauſe a man to take no fiſh, as it doth moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hap. The firſt is if that your harneſſe be not fit and well made. The ſecond is if your baites be not good and fine. The third is, if you angle not in biting time. The fourth is, if the fiſh be fraid with the ſight of man. The fift, if the water be red, thick, and white, of any floud lately fallen: the ſixt, if the Fiſh ſtirre not for cold: the ſeuenth, if the weather be hote: the eight, if it raine: the ninth, if it haile or ſnow: the tenth, if it ibe a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt: the eleuent, if it be a great wind: the twelfth is, if the wind be in the Eaſt, and that is worſt, for commonly neither in winter nor ſommer the fiſh will not bite if it bee in the Eaſt, the Weſt or the North is good, but the South is beſt of all.</p>
                     <p>And now I haue taught you to make your harneſſe, and how you ſhall fiſh therewith in all pointes. Now there reſteth to ſhew you what baites be beſt for euery kind of fiſh, for all times and ſeaſons of the yeare, which is the principall part of this art: without the knowledge of which baites, al the reſt before were to no purpoſe: for there is no man can take the fiſh to ſwallow the hooke without the bait, and therefore I haue ſet you downe euery Fiſh with his proper baite belonging to the time, and the beſt time to catcht them as followeth.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>And becauſe the Sammon of all fiſh is the moſt ſtatelieſt, therefore I meane to begin with him the firſt.</head>
                     <p>THe Sammon is a very gentle fiſh, but hee is troubleſome to take, for commonly he is in deepe places of great Riuers, and for the moſt part hee will keepe him in the middeſt of it, that you may not come at him, and he is in ſeaſon from March, vntill Michaelmas: in which ſeaſon you may angle for him, with theſe baytes if you can get them. Firſt with a red worme in the beginning and ending of the ſeaſon, and alſo with a grub
<pb facs="tcp:12759:42"/>
that bréedeth in a dounghill, and eſpecially there is a ſoueraine baite that breedeth in a water Docke, and he biteth not at the ground, but at the flote, you may take him when hee leapeth in like maner as doth a Trout or a Grailing, and theſe are proued baites for the Samon.</p>
                     <p>The Trout becauſe hée is a daintie Fiſh, and alſo a verie feruent byter: hee is the next that I meane to ſhewe you the time to catch him. From March vntill Michalmas hée lieth on the grauell, and in a ſtreame you may angle for him with a line, lying or running, ſauing in leaping time, and then with a dub, and early with a running ground line, and in the day time with a flote line. You ſhall angle for him in March, with a Menowe hanging on your hooke, by the nethernes without Flote or Plumbe, drawing vp and downe the ſtreame till you feele him faſt. Alſo it is good to angle for him with ground lines, and with a red worme, for the moſt part, and in Aprill take the ſame baytes, as alſo the Canker that bréedeth in a great tree, and the red ſnaile, you may take the bob worme vnder the Cowtord and the ſilke worme, and the bayte that breedeth on a Fearne leafe. In Iune take a red worme and nippe of his head, and a cod worme, and put it on the hooke. In Iuly take the Codworme, and the red worme together. In Auguſt take a fleſh flie, and the fat of Bacon, and bind them together about the hooke. In September take the red worme and the Menowe. In October take the ſame. There bee ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the Troute all times of the yeare. From Aprill vntill September the Troute leapeth: then angle for him with a dubbed hooke according to the mouth: which dubbed hookes you ſhall finde in the ende of this Treatiſe, and the mouthes with them.</p>
                     <p>The Grayling of ſome ſo called, of others Vmbre, It is a right delicate fiſh to mans mouth, and you may take him as you doe the Troute, and theſe are his baytes. In March and in Aprill the red worme, in May the green worme, a little brai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed worme, the docke canker, and the Hawthorne worme. In
<pb facs="tcp:12759:42"/>
Iune the bayte that breedeth betweene the Barke of an Oke. In Iuly a bait that breedeth on the Fearne leafe, and the great red worme, and nip off the head and put it on the hooke, and a Codworme before. In Auguſt the red worm and a dock worm, and all the yeare after a worme.</p>
                     <p>The Barbell is a ſweet fiſh, but he is a very queyſie meat, and verie daungerous to eate: for commonly hee bringeth an inconuenience to the Febres, and if he be eaten raw, he may be the cauſe of a mans death, which hath oftentimes béene ſéene, and theſe are his baites in March and in Aprill. Take freſh Cheeſe, and lay it on a Trencher, and cut it into ſmall peeces, the length of your hooke, then take a Candle and burne it on your hooke till it bee yellowe, and then bind it on you hooke with Fletchers Silke, and make it rough like a Welbede, this baite is good all the Sommer ſeaſon. In may and in Iune take the Hawihorne Worme, and the great red Worme, and nip the head off, and put a codworme on your hooke before, and this is a verie good baite. In Iuly take the red worme for the chiefe, and the Hawthorne, together with the waterdocke leafe worme. In Auguſt, and for all the yeare, take the tallowe of a ſheepe, and of ſoft cheeſe, eache of them alike, and a little Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and temper them together till they bée tough, and then put a little Flower into it, and make it in ſmall pellets, and that is a good bayte to Angle with at the ground, and looke that it ſinke in the water, or els it is not good for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The Carpe is a deyntie fiſh, but there is no great plentie of them, and therefore I write leaſt of him, but he is a verie ſubtile fiſh to take, for heée is ſo ſtrong in the mouth that there is no weake harnes will hold him: and as touching his baites I haue little knowledge thereof, and therefore I would be loth to write more then I know and haue proued: but I am ſure the red worm, and the Menow are good baites for him at all times, as I haue heard diuers good Fiſhers report.</p>
                     <p>The Cheuin is a ſtately fiſh, and his head is a deinty mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, there is no fiſh ſo ſtrongly enarmed on the bodie with
<pb facs="tcp:12759:43"/>
ſcales, and becauſe he is a ſtrong biter he hath the more baites, which are theſe: In March, the red worme at the ground: for commonly then he will bite there at all times of the yeare, if he be anie thing hungrie: In Aprill, the Canker that bréedeth in the tree, the worme that breedeth betweene the barke of the tree of Oke, the red worme, and the young Froſhes when the feete be cut off: alſo the Stone flye, the Bob vnder the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turd, the red Snaile: In May, the baite that breedeth in the Ozier leafe, and the Docke canker put on the hooke, and a baite that breedeth on the Fearne leafe, the Redworme, and the baite that groweth vpon the Hawthorne, and a baite that brée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on the Oke leafe, and a Silke worme and a Codworme together: In Iune, take the Creker and the Dorre, alſo a red worme the head beeing cut off, and a Codworme before, and put them on the hooke: alſo a Grub that bréedeth in the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, a great Greſhopper, and the Humble bee in the Medowe: Alſo young Bees and Hornets, and the flie that is among the Piſmiers hils. In Auguſt, take Wort wormes, and Maggots, till Michalmas. In September, the red worme, and a young Mouſe not heared, and the Houſe combe.</p>
                     <p>The Breame is a noble fiſh and a deyntie, and you ſhall angle for him from March vntill Auguſt with a red Worme, and then with a Butterflie, and with a baite that groweth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt greene Reede, and a baite that breedeth in the barke of a dead tree: and for Bremets take Maggots, and from that time forward all the yerre take the red worme: and in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, browne bread.</p>
                     <p>The Tench is a good fiſh, and healeth in a maner all other fiſh that bée hurt, if they may come to him, hée is moſt partes of the yeare in the mud, and ſtirreth moſt in Iune and Iuly, and in other ſeaſon but little, he is an euill biter, and his baites bee theſe: For all the yeare, browne bread toſted with Honney, the likeneſſe of a bantred loafe, and the great red wore, and take the blacke blood in the heart of a Sheepe, and flower and hony, and temper them all together, ſo make them ſofter then paſt,
<pb facs="tcp:12759:43"/>
and annoint the red worme therewith, both for this fiſh and for others, and they will bite much the better thereat all times of the yeare.</p>
                     <p>The Pearch is a deyntie fiſh, and paſſing wholeſome, and a great and earneſt biter: In march, the red worme, the Bob vnder the Cowturde. In Aprill and May, the Slowthorne, worme, and the Codworme. In Iune, the bait that breedeth in an old fallen Oke, and the great Canker. In Iuly the bait that breedeth on the Ozier leafe, and the Bob that breedeth on the dunghill, and the Hawthorne worme, and the Codworme. In Auguſt, the red worme and Maggots, and all the yeare after take the red worme for the beſt.</p>
                     <p>The Roch is an eaſie fiſh to take, and if he be fat and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then is hee good meate, and his baites are theſe. In March take the red worme. In Aprill, the Bob vnder the Cowturde. In May, the baite that breedeth in the Oken leafe, and the Bob on the dunghill. In Iune, the baite that breedeth on the Ozier, and the Codworme. In Iuly, the Houſe ſpies, and the baite that breedeth on an Oke, and the Notworme, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewes maggots, vntill Michalmas, and after that the fat of Bakon.</p>
                     <p>The Dace is a gentle Fiſh, and is verie good meate, in March his haite is a red worme, and in Aprill the Bob vnder the Cowtord. In May the docke cancker, and the bayte on the Slowthorne and that on the Oken leafe. In Iune the Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme and the baite on the Ozier, and the white Grub on the dunghill. In Iuly take houſe ſpies, and the flies that breede in Piſmyre hils, the Codworm and Magots till Michaelmas, and if the water be cleare, you ſhall take fiſh when other ſhall take none, and from that time forth do as you would do for the Roch: for commonly their biting and baites be alike.</p>
                     <p>The bleake is but a feeble fiſh, yet is he holſome. His baite from March till Michaelmas bée the ſame that I haue written for the Roche and the Dace, ſauing all the ſommer you may angle for him with a houſe flie, and in Winter ſeaſon with
<pb facs="tcp:12759:44"/>
Bacon, and with other baites as hereafter you ſhall learne.</p>
                     <p>The Ruffe is a very good and a holſome fiſh, and a frée bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but ſubtill withall, and you muſt angle for him with the ſame baites and the ſame ſeaſons of the yeare as I haue tolde you of the Pearch: for they bée like in fiſh and féeding, ſauing the Ruffe is leſſe, and therefore you muſt haue the ſmaller baytes.</p>
                     <p>The Flounder is a holſome fiſh and frée, but a ſubtill by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in this manner: for commonly when he ſucketh his meate, hée feedeth at the ground, and therefore you muſt angle for him with a ground line lying, and hée hath but one manner of bayt, and that is a red worme, and that is moſt chiefe for all manner of Fiſh.</p>
                     <p>The Gogin is a good fiſh of his bigneſſe, and he biteth well at the ground, and his baites for all the yeare is the red worme, Codworme and Magots, and you muſt angle for him with a flote, and let your baite bee neare the bottome, or els vpon the ground.</p>
                     <p>The Menowe when hée ſhineth in the water is bitter, and though his bodie bee but little, yet hée is a rauenous biter and eger, and you ſhall angle for him with the ſame baites that you doe for the Gogion, ſauing they muſt be ſmall.</p>
                     <p>The Eele is a queſie fiſh, and a rauenor and a deuourer of the broode of fiſh, and the Pike is alſo a deuourer of fiſh, I put them both behind all other fiſh for to angle. For the Eele, you ſhall find the hole in the ground of water, and it is blewe and blackiſh, there put in your hooke till it bee a foot within the hole, and your bait ſhall be a great angle with a Menowe.</p>
                     <p>The Pyke is a good fiſh, but that hée is a deuourer of all fiſh aſwell of his owne broode as of other, and therefore I loue him the worſe: and for to take him ye ſhall doe thus. Take a Rock or a freſh Herring, and a wyer with a hooke in the end, and put it in at the mouth and downe by the ridge to the taile of the Herring, and then put the line of your hooke in after, and draw the hooke into the cheeke of the freſh Herring, then
<pb facs="tcp:12759:44"/>
put a plumbe of leade on your line a yarde from your booke, and a flote in the midway betweene, and caſt it in a pit where the Pykes vſe, and this is the beſt and ſureſt way to take: and thrée manner of taking of him there is. Take a Froſh, and put it on your hooke betweene the ſkinne and the bodie in at the necke, on the backe halfe, and put on the flote a yard thereto, and caſt it where the Pyke haunteth, and you ſhall haue him. Another way: Take the ſame baite and put it in ſafe tied, and caſt it into the water with a Corke, and you ſhall not faile of him: And if you minde to haue good ſport, then tie your cord to a Gooſe foot, and you ſhall ſee good haling betweene the Gooſe and the Pyke, who ſhall haue the hetter.</p>
                     <p>Now you knowe with what baites and in what ſeaſons of the yeare you ſhall angle for euery kinde of fiſh, now I meane to tell you how you ſhall keepe and feede your quicke baites. You ſhall keepe them all in generall and euerie one ſeuerall by himſelfe, with ſuch things as they are bred in, and as long as they be quicke and newe they be fine: but when they be in a ſlough or dead, then they are nought: Out of theſe bée excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted three broodes: that is, Hornets, Humble bées and Waſpes, which you ſhall bake in bread, and dip their heades in blood, and let them drie. Alſo except Maggots, which when they bee bred great with their naturall feeding, you ſhall feede them furthermore with Sheepes tallowe, and take heede that in going about your diſports you open no mans gates, but that you ſhut them againe. Alſo you ſhall not vſe this ſport crafte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for couetouſneſſe, to the increaſing and ſparing of your money only, but principally for your ſolace, and for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of your bodily health. For when you purpoſe to goe on your diſports in fiſhing, you will not deſire greatly manie perſons with you, which might let you of your game, and then your minde may bee well giuen to the ſeruing of God, as in prayer or otherwiſe, and in ſo doing you ſhall eſchewe and auoyde manie vices, as Idleneſſe, which is the principall lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to vice, and it is commonly ſéene that it bringeth diuers
<pb facs="tcp:12759:45"/>
to their vtter deſtruction. Alſo you muſt not bee too deſirous of your game but with diſcretion, that you marre not other mens game and your owne too, as too much at one time, which you may lightly doe, if in euery poynt you fulfill this preſent treatiſe: but when you haue a ſufficient meſſe, to content your ſelfe for that time. Alſo you ſhall apply your ſelfe to the nouriſhing of the gaine, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of ſuch thinges as ſhall be the deuourers of it.</p>
