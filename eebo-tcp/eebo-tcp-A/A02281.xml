            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thus h√©e cha≈øeth vp and downe, and knoweth not ≈øometimes at what. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth home at night rayne beaten and pricked, and his clothes torne all to peeces, wet≈øhod and all myrie, and ≈øome of his
<pb facs="tcp:12759:37"/>
hounds lo≈øt, and ≈øome ≈øurbated. Such griefes and manie other happen vnto the Hunt≈ømen, which for di≈øplea≈øing of them that loue it I dare not report: thus truely mee thinketh it is not the be≈øt game and di≈øport of the foure.</p>
                  <p>Hawking is labourous and troubelous: for as often the Faulkner lo≈øeth his Hawkes, as the Hunter his Houndes, then is his game and di≈øport gone, yea, and full often hee crieth and whi≈øtleth, till he almo≈øt lo≈øeth his wind, his Hawke ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time taketh aboue, and giueth no minde nor ≈øight to him: for when hee would haue her flie, then ≈øhee will bathe: with mi≈øf√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ≈øhee will haue the frounce, and many other di≈øea≈øes that bringeth to ≈øouce. Thus by proofe, this is not the be≈øt di≈øport and game of the ≈øayd foure. In my opinion the game of Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is the ≈øimple≈øt: for in Winter in cold weather, the Fouler can doe no good, but in the harde≈øt and colde≈øt weather, which is greeuous: for when he would goe to his ginnes, hee cannot for colde: manie a deui≈øe hee maketh, and yet in the morning his fortune is hard, when hee is wet vp to the wa≈øte. Manie di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities I could ≈øhewe, but for offending I let them pa≈ø≈øe. Then ≈øith it is ≈øo, that Hawking, Hunting, and Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bee ≈øo laborous, that none of them may bee a meane to a merrie ≈øpirit, which is the cau≈øe of long life, vnto the ≈øayings of the wi≈øe in his Parables: doubtle≈ø≈øe then it mu≈øt followe, that fi≈øhing with the Angle is mo≈øt delectable, for all other are trouble≈øome and laberous: For in ≈øome kinde of fi≈øhing it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Fi≈øher through wet and ≈øo colde, that many and ≈øun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times there in≈øueth diuers infirmities through the ≈øame: But the Angler hee hath no colde, no di≈øea≈øe, no impediment, except it bee through him≈øelfe: for hee can lo≈øe but a Line or a Hooke at the mo≈øt, which hee may make againe at his owne lei≈øure, as he ≈øhall be taught hereafter: So then is not his lo≈ø≈øe greeuous if the fi≈øh breake away with his Hooke, that is the mo≈øt: for and he faile of one, hee hitteth of another: and if hee quite faile, yet hee hath his whole≈øome walkes, his plea≈øant ≈øhades, the ≈øweete ayre, the excellent ≈ømelles of the ≈øweete
<pb facs="tcp:12759:37"/>
Medowe flowers, which maketh him hungrie: hee heareth the melodious Harmonie of Birdes and other Foules, which hee thinketh is better then the noi≈øe of Hounds, the bla≈øt of Horns, or all the cry that Hunters, Faulkners, or Foulers can make: and if the Angler doe take fi≈øh, then hath h√©e a mercy ≈øpirit, and a glad heart. But who ≈øo will v≈øe this exerci≈øe, hee mu≈øt ri≈øe carely, which is profitable to man for the health of his bodie: For as the olde Engli≈øh Prouerbe is, who ≈øo dooth ri≈øe carely ≈øhall be holie, healthie, and happie. Thus I haue ≈øhewed in this Treati≈øe, that this di≈øport and game of Angling, is the very meane to induce a man to a merrie ≈øpirit. And to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of all tho≈øe that haue delight in the≈øe exerci≈øes, I haue col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this Treati≈øe following, which you may v≈øe at your plea≈øure.</p>
                  <p>IF you will bee perfite in this art of Angling, you mu≈øt fir≈øt learne to make your Implements: that is to ≈øay, your Rod, and your Lines of diuers colours: This done, you mu≈øt know how you mu≈øt angle, and in what place of the water, how d√©ep, and at what time of the day, and for what maner of Fi≈øh, and what weather, how many impediments there be in fi≈øhing, and ≈øpeciallie in Angling, and what baite belongeth to euerie fi≈øh euerie time of the yeare: And how you ≈øhall make your baites breede, where you ≈øhall finde them, and how you ≈øhall keepe them for the mo≈øt part: How you ≈øhall make your Hookes of Steele, and of O≈ømonde, ≈øome for the Dub, ≈øome for the Flote, and for the ground. And here I will teach you how you ≈øhall make your Rod: you ≈øhall cut it betweene Michalmas and Candlemas, of an ell and a halfe long, beeing the arme of a great Ha≈øell, Willow, or A≈øpe, and beth him in a whote Ouen, and ≈øet it euen and ≈øtraight, and let it cole a moneth, then take a corde and bind it fa≈øt about, and binde it to a fourme or to a peece of ≈øquare timber: then take a Plummers wyer that is euen and ≈øtreight, and ≈øharpe the one ende and heate it in the fire and Charcole, and burne the hole quite through in the pith,
<pb facs="tcp:12759:38"/>
beginning at both endes and goe on too the middle: you may burne the hole with a Bird broch, but let the la≈øt broch b√©e big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then any of them before, then let it lie and coole two daies, vnbinde it and let it lie in the ≈ømoke, or the roufe of a hou≈øe, till it bee through drie. In the ≈øame ≈øea≈øon cut a yard of greene Ha≈øell, and beth it euen and ≈øtraigh, and let it drie with the ≈øtaffe: and when it is drie make it fit for the hole in the ≈øtaffe, vnto the halfe length of the ≈øtaffe: and to fill the other halfe of the crop, take a faire ≈øhute of Black thorne, Crab tree Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or els of Iuniper, cut in the ≈øame ≈øea≈øon, and well bethed and ≈øtraight, and ≈øet them fit together, ≈øo that the crop may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all into the ≈øayde hole, then ≈øhaue your ≈øtaffe and make it Tapar wi≈øe, then hoope the ≈øtaffe at both endes with long hoopes of yron, or latten after the cleanlie≈øt maner, and a pike in the nether end fa≈øtened with a running wyer to take in and out of your ≈øtaffe, and ≈øet your crop a handfull within your vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of your ≈øtaffe, in ≈øuch wi≈øe that it bee as biggethere as in anie other place aboue, then arme your ≈øtaffe downe to the fret with a Line of ≈øixe heares, and dubble the Line and fret it fa≈øt on with a peece of a bowe: And thus you ≈øhall make you a ≈øtaffe to walke with, and no man may knowe whether you haue ≈øuch Implements about you: It will b√©e very light and nimble to fi≈øh with at your plea≈øure, and is alwaies very ready and nece≈ø≈øarie.</p>
                  <p>AFter you haue thus made your Rod, you mu≈øt learne to colour your Lines of heare after this manner. You mu≈øt take of a white Hor≈øe taile the longe≈øt heares you can get, and the bigger and rounder it is, the better it is, depart them in ≈øixe parts, and colour euery part by him≈øelfe in diuers colours: as yeallowe, greene, tawnie, browne, ru≈ø≈øet, or du≈økie colour: And for to make your heare take a good creene colour, you mu≈øt take a quart of Ale, and put into it halfe a pound of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, and put your heare and all together in a little pan, and let them boyle ≈øofly halfe an hower, then take out your heare
<pb facs="tcp:12759:38"/>
and let them drie, then take a pottle of faire water, and put it into a pan, and two handfulles of Wexen, and pre≈ø≈øe it with a Tyle ≈øtone, and let it boyle ≈øoftly the ≈øpace of an hower: and when it is yeallowe on the ≈økumme, put therein your heares, with halfe a pound of Copperous beaten into powder, and let it boyle the ≈øpace of going of halfe a mile, and then ≈øet it downe and let it coole the ≈øpace of fiue or ≈øixe howers, then take out the heare and drie it, and it will b√©e the be≈øt greene for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that can bee, and the more that you put of Copperous to it the better it will be.</p>

                     <p>When your heare is thus collected, you mu≈øt knowe for which waters and which ≈øea≈øons they ≈øhall ≈øerue, the greene cullour for all cleare waters from Aprill vntill September. The yellowe cullour in euery cleare water from September to Nouember. For it is like the Weedes and other kinde of gra≈ø≈øe that is broken in the Riuer. The ru≈ø≈øet cullour ≈øerueth all the Winter vntill the ende of Aprill, as well in Riuers as in Pooles or lakes.</p>
                     <p>The browne cullour ≈øerueth for the water that is blacki≈øh, in Riuers or other waters: the tawny cullours, for tho≈øe riuers or waters that be heathy or mori≈øh.</p>
                     <p>Now you mu≈øt make your lines after this order. Fir≈øt you mu≈øt haue an in≈øcrument for the twi≈øting of your line. Take your heare and cut off a handfull at the ende, becau≈øe it is not ≈øtrong enough, then turne the top to the tayle ouer each alike, and make it into three parts, and knit euerie part by him≈øelfe, and knit the other end altogether: then put that end fa≈øt into your in≈øtrument into the clift, and make it fa≈øt with a wedge, fower fingers ≈øhorter then your heare, then twine your warpe one way alike, and fa≈øten them in three cliftes alike ≈øtraight, then take that out at the other end, and let it twine that way that it de≈øireth, then ≈øtreine it a little, and knit it for vndoing, and that is good.</p>
                     <p>So when you haue ≈øo manie links as will ≈øuffice for a line to make it long enough, then mu≈øt you knit them together with a water knot, or a Dutch knot, and when your knot is knit, cut of the voyde ≈øhore endes a ≈øtrawe breadth from the knot, thus ≈øhall your lines be fayre and euen: and al≈øo ≈øure for any maner of Fi≈øh.</p>
                     <p>The fine≈øt practi≈øe is in making your hockes, and for the making of them you may haue your ≈øeuerall kinde of tooles that you may doe them artificiallie. A ≈øemy clam of yron, a bendor, a payre of long and ≈ømall tongues, and a knife ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb facs="tcp:12759:39"/>
hard and thicke, an Anuild, and a little hammer.</p>
                     <p>And for a ≈ømall Fi≈øh you ≈øhall take the ≈ømalle≈øt quarrell Needles that you can find of Steele: and you ≈øhall put the Quarrell in a fyre of Charcole till it bee of the ≈øame cullour that the fire is, then take it out and lay it to coole, and you ≈øhall find it well alayd to file, then ray≈øe the beard with your knife, and make the poynt ≈øharpe, then alay him againe or el≈øe hee will breake in the bending, then bend him as h√©e will ≈øerue for your purpo≈øe, you ≈øhall make them of great Needles, as ≈øhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers Needles, Taylers needles, or imbroderers Needles: but looke that they will bowe at the point or els they bee not good, and when you haue beaten flat the end of the hooke, fyle him ≈ømooth that it fret not the line, the put it into the fire, and giue it an ea≈øie red heat, then ≈øuddainly quench it in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and it will b√©e hard and ≈øtrong. And for to haue knowledge of your In≈øtruments that bee nece≈ø≈øarie, without the which you are not able to accompli≈øh your de≈øire, that is, your Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Knife, Pyn≈øon, Claem, Wedge, File, Wre≈øt, and a Needle.</p>
                     <p>When you haue made your hookes, then you mu≈øt ≈øet them on according to their ≈øtrength and greatne≈ø≈øe. Fir≈øt take ≈ømall red ≈øilke, and if it bee for a great hooke then double it and twi≈øt it, and for a ≈ømall hooke let it be ≈øingle, and therewith fret the line where as you will haue the hooke ≈øtand, a ≈øtrawe breadth, then ≈øet to your hooke and fret it with the ≈øame thred the two partes, of the length that it ≈øhall bee fret in all, and when you come to the third part, then turne the end of your line vp again double, to the other third part, then put your thred in at the hole twi≈øe or thri≈øe, and let it goe each time about the yeard of your hooke: then wette the hooke and drawe, and looke that your line lie euermore within your hookes, and not without, and then cut of the lines end, and the thred as nigh as you can, ≈øauing the fret.</p>
                     <p>So, yee knowe with how great Hookes you ≈øhall angle to euery fi≈øh, now I will tell with how many heares you ≈øhall
<pb facs="tcp:12759:40"/>
angle for euerie fi≈øh. Fir≈øt for the Menowe with a line of one heare: For the waring Roche, the Bleake, the Gogion, and the Ruffe, with a line of three heares: For the Dace and the Roch, with a line of three heares: For the Pearch, the Floun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Bremet, with a line of foure heares: For the Cheuin, the Breame, the Tench, and the Eele, with ≈øixe heares: For the Troute, and the gra≈øing Barble, and the great Cheuin, with nine heares: For the great Troute with twelue heares: For the Salmon, with fifteene heares: and for a Pyke with a chalke line made in the colour afore≈øayd, armed with a line, as you ≈øhall heare hereafter. When I ≈øpeake of the Pyke, your Lines mu≈øt bee plumed with lead, and the neare≈øt plumbe to the Hooke, bee a foote of at the lea≈øt, and euery plumbe of the quantitie of the bigne≈ø≈øe of the line: There be thr√©e maner of plumbes, for a ground line, renning, and for the ≈ølote: ≈øet vpon the ground line lying, ten plumbs all ioyning together on the ground line, renning, nine or ten ≈ømall: the flote plumbe ≈øhall be heauie, that the fir≈øt plucke of any fi≈øh may pull it into the water, and make your plumbes round and ≈ømooth, that they ≈øticke not on ≈øtones and w√©edes.</p>
                     <p>THen you ≈øhall make your ≈ølotes in this manner. Take a peece of a Corke that is cleane without holes, and bore it through with a ≈ømall hote yron, and put thereinto a quill or pen euen and ≈øtraight: alwaies note that the greater the hole, the bigger the pen, and ≈øhape it great in the midde≈øt, and ≈ømall at both ends, and e≈øpeciallie ≈øharpe in the nether end, and make them ≈ømooth on a Grind≈øtone, and looke that the flote for one heare be no bigger then a Peas, for two hears as a Beame, for twelue heares as a Walnut, and ≈øo euery line mu≈øt haue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his portion. Al maner of lines that be not for the ground, mu≈øt haue flotes: &amp; the renning ground line mu≈øt haue a flote, and the lying ground line mu≈øt haue a flote.</p>
                     <p>NOw I haue taught you to make your heares, hereafter I meane to ≈øhewe you the art of Angling. You ≈øhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand
<pb facs="tcp:12759:40"/>
that there is ≈øixe manner of Anglings: the one is at the ground for the Troute, and other fi≈øh: another is at the ground at the Arch or ≈øtang where it ebbeth and floweth, for Bleake, Roch, and Dace: the third is with a flote for all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fi≈øh: the fourth, with a Menowe for the Troute without plumbe or flote: the fift is renning in the ≈øame for the Roche and Dace with two heares or one heare, and a flie: the fixt is a dubbed hocke for the Troute or Grayling. And for the fir≈øt and principall poynt in Angling, looke that you keepe you from the ≈øight of the fi≈øh, either ≈øtande clo≈øe on the land, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde ≈øome bu≈øh: for if h√©e ≈ø√©e you, then your ≈øport is marde for he will not bite, and looke that you ≈øhadowe not the water as little as you can, for it is that which will make him be gone: for if the fi≈øh b√©e fraide h√©e will not bite a good while after. For all manner of fi≈øh that feede by grounde, you mu≈øt angle for them to the bottome, ≈øo that your hooke ≈øhall runne and lie on the ground: and for all other fi≈øh that feedeth aboue, you ≈øhall angle for them at the midde≈øt of the water, or aboue the mid≈øt, or belowe the midde≈øt whether ye will, for the greater the fi≈øh, the nearer he lieth to the bottome of the water, and euermore the ≈ømaller the fi≈øh, the more he ≈øwimmeth aboue. The third good poynt, is when the fi≈øh biteth, that you be not too ha≈øtie to ≈ømite nor to take: for you mu≈øt abide till the bayte bee farre in the mouth of the fi≈øh, and then tarrie no longer, and this is for the ground: and for the flote when you ≈øee it pulled into the water, or els caried ≈øoftly vpon the water, then ≈ømite, and looke that you neuer ouer-≈ømite the ≈øtrength of your line for brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: And if it be your fortune to ≈ømite a great fi≈øh with a ≈ømal line, then you mu≈øt leade him in the water, and labour him there till he b√©e drowned and ouercome, then take him as well as you can, and euer take heede that you ≈øtreyne him not ouer the ≈øtrength of your line, and as much as you can let him not goe pa≈øt your lines ende from you, but keepe him euer vnder your Rod, and holde him as ≈øtreight as your line will ≈øu≈øtain, and beare his leapes and his plunges as well as you can with

                     <head>Here I will declare vnto you, in what place of the vvater you ≈øhall angle, either in Poole or ≈øtanding water, &amp; according to the deepenes of the ≈øaid water.</head>
                     <p>THere is no great diuer≈øitie in anie place of a Poole, ≈øo it b√©e deepe, for it is a pri≈øon to all fi≈øhes, and therefore the ≈øooner taken: but in the Riuer the be≈øt angling is where it is deepe, and cleare by the ground, as grauell or clay without mud or weedes, and e≈øpecially if there bee any whirling in the water, or a couert, as a hollowe bancke or great rootes of Trees, or long weedes fleeting aboue the waters, where the fi≈øh may hide them≈øelues at certaine times when they li≈øt. Al≈øo it is good to angle in ≈øtiffe ≈øtreames, and al≈øo in vallies of waters, and in flood gates, and Mill pits, and at the bancke where the ≈øtreame runneth, and is deepe and cleare by the ground, and in any place where the fi≈øh haunt and haue any feeding.</p>
                     <p>Now you ≈øhall vnder≈øtand the be≈øt time of the yeere, and the be≈øt times of the day, from the beginning of May to Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember: the be≈øt time of their baiting is from foure a clocke in the morning vntill eight a clocke, and from foure in the after noone till eight at night: but it is not ≈øo good in the afternoone as in the morning: and if it b√©e a cold winde and a lowring day it is much better then a cleare day, and the Poole fi≈øhes will bite be≈øt in the morning.</p>
                     <p>And if you ≈øee at anie time of the day the Trout or the Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling leape, angle for him with a dub according to the ≈øea≈øon of the yeare, and where the water ebbeth and floweth: the fi≈øh wil bite in ≈øome place at the ebbe, and in ≈øome place at the flood, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue had re≈øting behind Stanges and Arches of Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and other ≈øuch places.</p>
                     <p>The principall time to angle is in a lowring day, when the winde bloweth ≈øoftly: for in Summer when it is verie whote then it is naught: from September vntill Aprill in a fayre Sunnie day, it is very good angling, and if the winde at that
<pb facs="tcp:12759:41"/>
time haue anie parte of the Orient weather, then it is naught: and when it is a great winde &amp; that it ≈ønoweth, raineth, or hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, or is a great tempe≈øt, as Thunder or Lightning, or a ≈øwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hot weather, then it is naught for to angle.</p>
                     <p>You ≈øhall further vnder≈øtand that there be twelue empedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which cau≈øe a man to take no fi≈øh, as it doth mo≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hap. The fir≈øt is if that your harne≈ø≈øe be not fit and well made. The ≈øecond is if your baites be not good and fine. The third is, if you angle not in biting time. The fourth is, if the fi≈øh be fraid with the ≈øight of man.

                     <p>And now I haue taught you to make your harne≈ø≈øe, and how you ≈øhall fi≈øh therewith in all pointes. Now there re≈øteth to ≈øhew you what baites be be≈øt for euery kind of fi≈øh, for all times and ≈øea≈øons of the yeare, which is the principall part of this art: without the knowledge of which baites, al the re≈øt before were to no purpo≈øe: for there is no man can take the fi≈øh to ≈øwallow the hooke without the bait, and therefore I haue ≈øet you downe euery Fi≈øh with his proper baite belonging to the time, and the be≈øt time to catcht them as followeth.</p>

                     <p>THe Sammon is a very gentle fi≈øh, but hee is trouble≈øome to take, for commonly he is in deepe places of great Riuers, and for the mo≈øt part hee will keepe him in the midde≈øt of it, that you may not come at him, and he is in ≈øea≈øon from March, vntill Michaelmas: in which ≈øea≈øon you may angle for him, with the≈øe baytes if you can get them. Fir≈øt with a red worme in the beginning and ending of the ≈øea≈øon, and al≈øo with a grub

that br√©edeth in a dounghill, and e≈øpecially there is a ≈øoueraine baite that breedeth in a water Docke, and he biteth not at the ground, but at the flote, you may take him when hee leapeth in like maner as doth a Trout or a Grailing, and the≈øe are proued baites for the Samon.</p>
                     <p>The Trout becau≈øe h√©e is a daintie Fi≈øh, and al≈øo a verie feruent byter: hee is the next that I meane to ≈øhewe you the time to catch him. From March vntill Michalmas h√©e lieth on the grauell, and in a ≈øtreame you may angle for him with a line, lying or running, ≈øauing in leaping time, and then with a dub, and early with a running ground line, and in the day time with a flote line. You ≈øhall angle for him in March, with a Menowe hanging on your hooke, by the nethernes without Flote or Plumbe, drawing vp and downe the ≈øtreame till you feele him fa≈øt. Al≈øo it is good to angle for him with ground lines, and with a red worme, for the mo≈øt part, and in Aprill take the ≈øame baytes, as al≈øo the Canker that br√©edeth in a great tree, and the red ≈ønaile, you may take the bob worme vnder the Cowtord and the ≈øilke worme, and the bayte that breedeth on a Fearne leafe. In Iune take a red worme and nippe of his head, and a cod worme, and put it on the hooke. In Iuly take the Codworme, and the red worme together. In Augu≈øt take a fle≈øh flie, and the fat of Bacon, and bind them together about the hooke. In September take the red worme and the Menowe. In October take the ≈øame. There bee ≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the Troute all times of the yeare. From Aprill vntill September the Troute leapeth: then angle for him with a dubbed hooke according to the mouth: which dubbed hookes you ≈øhall finde in the ende of this Treati≈øe, and the mouthes with them.</p>
                     <p>The Grayling of ≈øome ≈øo called, of others Vmbre, It is a right delicate fi≈øh to mans mouth, and you may take him as you doe the Troute, and the≈øe are his baytes. In March and in Aprill the red worme, in May the green worme, a little brai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed worme, the docke canker, and the Hawthorne worme. In
<pb facs="tcp:12759:42"/>
Iune the bayte that breedeth betweene the Barke of an Oke. In Iuly a bait that breedeth on the Fearne leafe, and the great red worme, and nip off the head and put it on the hooke, and a Codworme before. In Augu≈øt the red worm and a dock worm, and all the yeare after a worme.</p>
                     <p>The Barbell is a ≈øweet fi≈øh, but he is a very quey≈øie meat, and verie daungerous to eate: for commonly hee bringeth an inconuenience to the Febres, and if he be eaten raw, he may be the cau≈øe of a mans death, which hath oftentimes b√©ene ≈ø√©ene, and the≈øe are his baites in March and in Aprill. Take fre≈øh Chee≈øe, and lay it on a Trencher, and cut it into ≈ømall peeces, the length of your hooke, then take a Candle and burne it on your hooke till it bee yellowe, and then bind it on you hooke with Fletchers Silke, and make it rough like a Welbede, this baite is good all the Sommer ≈øea≈øon. In may and in Iune take the Hawihorne Worme, and the great red Worme, and nip the head off, and put a codworme on your hooke before, and this is a verie good baite. In Iuly take the red worme for the chiefe, and the Hawthorne, together with the waterdocke leafe worme. In Augu≈øt, and for all the yeare, take the tallowe of a ≈øheepe, and of ≈øoft chee≈øe, eache of them alike, and a little Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and temper them together till they b√©e tough, and then put a little Flower into it, and make it in ≈ømall pellets, and that is a good bayte to Angle with at the ground, and looke that it ≈øinke in the water, or els it is not good for that purpo≈øe.</p>
                     <p>The Carpe is a deyntie fi≈øh, but there is no great plentie of them, and therefore I write lea≈øt of him, but he is a verie ≈øubtile fi≈øh to take, for he√©e is ≈øo ≈øtrong in the mouth that there is no weake harnes will hold him: and as touching his baites I haue little knowledge thereof, and therefore I would be loth to write more then I know and haue proued: but I am ≈øure the red worm, and the Menow are good baites for him at all times, as I haue heard diuers good Fi≈øhers report.</p>
                     <p>The Cheuin is a ≈øtately fi≈øh, and his head is a deinty mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell, there is no fi≈øh ≈øo ≈øtrongly enarmed on the bodie with
<pb facs="tcp:12759:43"/>
≈øcales, and becau≈øe he is a ≈øtrong biter he hath the more baites, which are the≈øe: In March, the red worme at the ground: for commonly then he will bite there at all times of the yeare, if he be anie thing hungrie: In Aprill, the Canker that br√©edeth in the tree, the worme that breedeth betweene the barke of the tree of Oke, the red worme, and the young Fro≈øhes when the feete be cut off: al≈øo the Stone flye, the Bob vnder the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turd, the red Snaile: In May, the baite that breedeth in the Ozier leafe, and the Docke canker put on the hooke, and a baite that breedeth on the Fearne leafe, the Redworme, and the baite that groweth vpon the Hawthorne, and a baite that br√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on the Oke leafe, and a Silke worme and a Codworme together: In Iune, take the Creker and the Dorre, al≈øo a red worme the head beeing cut off, and a Codworme before, and put them on the hooke: al≈øo a Grub that br√©edeth in the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, a great Gre≈øhopper, and the Humble bee in the Medowe: Al≈øo young Bees and Hornets, and the flie that is among the Pi≈ømiers hils. In Augu≈øt, take Wort wormes, and Maggots, till Michalmas. In September, the red worme, and a young Mou≈øe not heared, and the Hou≈øe combe.</p>
                     <p>The Breame is a noble fi≈øh and a deyntie, and you ≈øhall angle for him from March vntill Augu≈øt with a red Worme, and then with a Butterflie, and with a baite that groweth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt greene Reede, and a baite that breedeth in the barke of a dead tree: and for Bremets take Maggots, and from that time forward all the yerre take the red worme: and in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, browne bread.</p>
                     <p>The Tench is a good fi≈øh, and healeth in a maner all other fi≈øh that b√©e hurt, if they may come to him, h√©e is mo≈øt partes of the yeare in the mud, and ≈øtirreth mo≈øt in Iune and Iuly, and in other ≈øea≈øon but little, he is an euill biter, and his baites bee the≈øe: For all the yeare, browne bread to≈øted with Honney, the likene≈ø≈øe of a bantred loafe, and the great red wore, and take the blacke blood in the heart of a Sheepe, and flower and hony, and temper them all together, ≈øo make them ≈øofter then pa≈øt,
<pb facs="tcp:12759:43"/>
and annoint the red worme therewith, both for this fi≈øh and for others, and they will bite much the better thereat all times of the yeare.</p>
                     <p>The Pearch is a deyntie fi≈øh, and pa≈ø≈øing whole≈øome, and a great and earne≈øt biter: In march, the red worme, the Bob vnder the Cowturde. In Aprill and May, the Slowthorne, worme, and the Codworme. In Iune, the bait that breedeth in an old fallen Oke, and the great Canker. In Iuly the bait that breedeth on the Ozier leafe, and the Bob that breedeth on the dunghill, and the Hawthorne worme, and the Codworme. In Augu≈øt, the red worme and Maggots, and all the yeare after take the red worme for the be≈øt.</p>
                     <p>The Roch is an ea≈øie fi≈øh to take, and if he be fat and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then is hee good meate, and his baites are the≈øe. In March take the red worme. In Aprill, the Bob vnder the Cowturde. In May, the baite that breedeth in the Oken leafe, and the Bob on the dunghill. In Iune, the baite that breedeth on the Ozier, and the Codworme. In Iuly, the Hou≈øe ≈øpies, and the baite that breedeth on an Oke, and the Notworme, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewes maggots, vntill Michalmas, and after that the fat of Bakon.</p>
                     <p>The Dace is a gentle Fi≈øh, and is verie good meate, in March his haite is a red worme, and in Aprill the Bob vnder the Cowtord. In May the docke cancker, and the bayte on the Slowthorne and that on the Oken leafe. In Iune the Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme and the baite on the Ozier, and the white Grub on the dunghill. In Iuly take hou≈øe ≈øpies, and the flies that breede in Pi≈ømyre hils, the Codworm and Magots till Michaelmas, and if the water be cleare, you ≈øhall take fi≈øh when other ≈øhall take none, and from that time forth do as you would do for the Roch: for commonly their biting and baites be alike.</p>
                     <p>The bleake is but a feeble fi≈øh, yet is he hol≈øome. His baite from March till Michaelmas b√©e the ≈øame that I haue written for the Roche and the Dace, ≈øauing all the ≈øommer you may angle for him with a hou≈øe flie, and in Winter ≈øea≈øon with
<pb facs="tcp:12759:44"/>
Bacon, and with other baites as hereafter you ≈øhall learne.</p>
                     <p>The Ruffe is a very good and a hol≈øome fi≈øh, and a fr√©e bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but ≈øubtill withall, and you mu≈øt angle for him with the ≈øame baites and the ≈øame ≈øea≈øons of the yeare as I haue tolde you of the Pearch: for they b√©e like in fi≈øh and f√©eding, ≈øauing the Ruffe is le≈ø≈øe, and therefore you mu≈øt haue the ≈ømaller baytes.</p>
                     <p>The Flounder is a hol≈øome fi≈øh and fr√©e, but a ≈øubtill by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in this manner: for commonly when he ≈øucketh his meate, h√©e feedeth at the ground, and therefore you mu≈øt angle for him with a ground line lying, and h√©e hath but one manner of bayt, and that is a red worme, and that is mo≈øt chiefe for all manner of Fi≈øh.</p>
                     <p>The Gogin is a good fi≈øh of his bigne≈ø≈øe, and he biteth well at the ground, and his baites for all the yeare is the red worme, Codworme and Magots, and you mu≈øt angle for him with a flote, and let your baite bee neare the bottome, or els vpon the ground.</p>
                     <p>The Menowe when h√©e ≈øhineth in the water is bitter, and though his bodie bee but little, yet h√©e is a rauenous biter and eger, and you ≈øhall angle for him with the ≈øame baites that you doe for the Gogion, ≈øauing they mu≈øt be ≈ømall.</p>
                     <p>The Eele is a que≈øie fi≈øh, and a rauenor and a deuourer of the broode of fi≈øh, and the Pike is al≈øo a deuourer of fi≈øh, I put them both behind all other fi≈øh for to angle. For the Eele, you ≈øhall find the hole in the ground of water, and it is blewe and blacki≈øh, there put in your hooke till it bee a foot within the hole, and your bait ≈øhall be a great angle with a Menowe.</p>
                     <p>The Pyke is a good fi≈øh, but that h√©e is a deuourer of all fi≈øh a≈øwell of his owne broode as of other, and therefore I loue him the wor≈øe: and for to take him ye ≈øhall doe thus. Take a Rock or a fre≈øh Herring, and a wyer with a hooke in the end, and put it in at the mouth and downe by the ridge to the taile of the Herring, and then put the line of your hooke in after, and draw the hooke into the cheeke of the fre≈øh Herring, then
<pb facs="tcp:12759:44"/>
put a plumbe of leade on your line a yarde from your booke, and a flote in the midway betweene, and ca≈øt it in a pit where the Pykes v≈øe, and this is the be≈øt and ≈øure≈øt way to take: and thr√©e manner of taking of him there is. Take a Fro≈øh, and put it on your hooke betweene the ≈økinne and the bodie in at the necke, on the backe halfe, and put on the flote a yard thereto, and ca≈øt it where the Pyke haunteth, and you ≈øhall haue him. Another way: Take the ≈øame baite and put it in ≈øafe tied, and ca≈øt it into the water with a Corke, and you ≈øhall not faile of him: And if you minde to haue good ≈øport, then tie your cord to a Goo≈øe foot, and you ≈øhall ≈øee good haling betweene the Goo≈øe and the Pyke, who ≈øhall haue the hetter.</p>
                     <p>Now you knowe with what baites and in what ≈øea≈øons of the yeare you ≈øhall angle for euery kinde of fi≈øh, now I meane to tell you how you ≈øhall keepe and feede your quicke baites. You ≈øhall keepe them all in generall and euerie one ≈øeuerall by him≈øelfe, with ≈øuch things as they are bred in, and as long as they be quicke and newe they be fine: but when they be in a ≈ølough or dead, then they are nought: Out of the≈øe b√©e excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted three broodes: that is, Hornets, Humble b√©es and Wa≈øpes, which you ≈øhall bake in bread, and dip their heades in blood, and let them drie. Al≈øo except Maggots, which when they bee bred great with their naturall feeding, you ≈øhall feede them furthermore with Sheepes tallowe, and take heede that in going about your di≈øports you open no mans gates, but that you ≈øhut them againe. Al≈øo you ≈øhall not v≈øe this ≈øport crafte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for couetou≈øne≈ø≈øe, to the increa≈øing and ≈øparing of your money only, but principally for your ≈øolace, and for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of your bodily health. For when you purpo≈øe to goe on your di≈øports in fi≈øhing, you will not de≈øire greatly manie per≈øons with you, which might let you of your game, and then your minde may bee well giuen to the ≈øeruing of God, as in prayer or otherwi≈øe, and in ≈øo doing you ≈øhall e≈øchewe and auoyde manie vices, as Idlene≈ø≈øe, which is the principall lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to vice, and it is commonly ≈ø√©ene that it bringeth diuers
<pb facs="tcp:12759:45"/>
to their vtter de≈øtruction. Al≈øo you mu≈øt not bee too de≈øirous of your game but with di≈øcretion, that you marre not other mens game and your owne too, as too much at one time, which you may lightly doe, if in euery poynt you fulfill this pre≈øent treati≈øe: but when you haue a ≈øufficient me≈ø≈øe, to content your ≈øelfe for that time. Al≈øo you ≈øhall apply your ≈øelfe to the nouri≈øhing of the gaine, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroying of ≈øuch thinges as ≈øhall be the deuourers of it.</p>
