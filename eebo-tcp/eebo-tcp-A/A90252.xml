            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis day having brought to my Hands yours, with the encloſed Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation and Petition of ſeveral Officers of the Army, to which you deſire the Subſcription of the Officers of this Garriſon; I have accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly convened and imparted your Letter and Paper to them; Upon conſideration whereof, finding our ſelves at this diſtance to be wholly ignorant of the late proceeds whereupon we ſuppoſe it to be grounded: as alſo for that it is already tendered to the Parliament, which we apprehend hath Reſolved our Subſcriptions out of ſeaſon, We have thought it improper for us to ſubſcribe the ſame. Nevertheleſſe, that we may not leave you without ſatisfaction as to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with you, in what may expreſſe our faithfulneſs to the Parliament, from whom we are Commiſſionated upon publick Account, and thereby bound in all due Obedience, We look upon our ſelves as obliged to Declare our full purpoſe of heart to manifeſt our ſtedfaſtneſſe to the Parliament, according to the tenour of our reſpective Intruſtments, in adhering to them in all their juſt and Warrantable proceedings, in purſuance of the Truſt repoſed in us; whereby we hope, that nor only the Deſigns of all publick and private Adverſaries will be diſappointed; but we ſhall further (by Gods bleſſing) expect to ſee ſome further fruit of our former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations for Truth and Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p rend="indent">This, as we doubt not but it will ſatisfie you of our firm and unfeighned intents to the Parliament in all their Juſt and Equitable determinations: So we truſt the former Reaſons, moving us to wave the Subſcriptions of yours incloſed, will be of weight with you, to give us your excuſe, and eſteem us ſtill as,</p>
