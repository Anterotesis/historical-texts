            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

By lengthning and drawing out their inteſtine Wars with the Plagues and Miſeries attending them, for many yeers ſpace, as our ancient and late Wars manifeſt) by a tedious and ſucceſſive Seige of their Garriſons, till redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; to the great waſte, ſpoile, deſtruction and impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people; the innumerable increaſe of fatherleſſe children, Widdows, poor and maimed perſons, the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, deaths of thouſands more then if there were no ſuch Garriſons. 2. By multiplying the Peoples Taxes, Expences, to furniſh and maintain theſe Garriſons, and raiſe, pay a great Field Army beſides, for theſe Garriſons ſecurity, which would be a ſufficient ſafeguard to the Nation without them. 3. By leſſening the number, weakning the ſtrength, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting the Military Proviſions with all other ſupplies and recruits of the <hi>Field Armies,</hi> in whoſe good or bad ſucceſſe, ſtrength or weakneſſe, the Safety or Ruine, Preſervation or Conqueſt of the Nation (next under God) doth alone principally conſiſt; and whoſe Victories or ill ſucceſſes the whole Nation, with all Garriſons uſually do, will and muſt of neceſſity follow; their Garriſons being unable to defend them from Plunder, total and final Conqueſt, if their Field Armies be quite routed or deſtroyed; which would ſpeedily end the Wars by Pitched Battels in the Field in a few dayes, weeks, months at furtheſt, were it not for beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and taking in Garriſons, which (through the <hi>Artifice</hi> of <hi>Mercenary Officers</hi> and Soldiers) protract the Wars for many yeers, and continue the <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Miſeries</hi> of <hi>war</hi> upon the Nation far longer then if there were no Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

            <p n="2">2. They are in times of actual War moſt prejudicial to the Towns and Places Garriſond in theſe enſuing regards. 1. By doubling, trebling their Taxes, Contributions, Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, charges to new fortifie and furniſh theſe Garriſons with Ammunition, Artillery, Cannons, Proviſions, Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines of all ſorts; augmenting their mercenary Guards and Soldiers by hundreds and thouſands in ſome places, to their great impoveriſhing and vexation; and that oft times, to betray them to the Enemy at laſt; yea, to loſe thoſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons in a few dayes or howrs, which they have thus (to their vaſt expence and trouble) been fortifying, furniſhing, guarding many moneths or yeers ſpace together, as the late Preſidents of <hi>Briſtol, Hereford,</hi> with other Garriſons belonging both to the King and Parliament in <hi>England, Ireland, Scotland</hi> and elſewhere, demonſtrate; and the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of all Ages, Countries teſtifie. 2. By continual bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting quartering and free-quartering the Garriſon Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Officers on the Inhabitants, within or near the Garriſons, to their great oppreſſion, vexation (ſuperadded to their Taxes) oft times to their utter undoing. 3.

Tenthly, The unavoidable reception of greater, and uſually worſe domineering new Garriſons from the conquering Enemies; oft ſpoiling, plundering firing ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming, executing the wealthieſt of the Inhabitants (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all Articles of agreement for their Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Security) though taken by ſurrender onely, not by ſtorm; which Articles are uſually much violated, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60311:9"/>
very ſeldome kept by faithleſſe, greedy, rude, plundering Officers or Soldiers, who add affliction to affliction, and a new undoing to the old; to whoſe new Lording Lawleſſe power, Orders, Pleaſures, Government, the Inhabitants muſt all ſubmit, or elſe they &amp; their Families muſt be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with baniſhed out of their native Habitations, as enemies, ſtript naked of all they have, and forced to wander cold &amp; naked about the Countrey like vagrants for bread, clothes, relief, houſeroom, which they plentifully enjoyed before, to the breaking of their hearts, and ſhortning of their lives. Eleventhly, Theſe Garriſons are oft taken &amp; re-taken over and over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo as oft plundered, re plundered, ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ranſomed, and new garriſond by both ſides; yea thoſe of them who were protected as friends and favorites to the one ſide, are ſure to be moſt ſpoiled, plundered, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, perſecuted by the other, and to ſuffer thus in their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive turns till they be quite undone and ruined by their frequent takings and re-takings on both ſides; as <hi>Briſtol, Exeter,</hi> with other places, have found by late ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: the viciſſitudes and miſeries of theſe Garriſons ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſing till their Wars and Garriſons ceaſe, and they became no Garriſons. Twelfly: If any beſieged Garriſons eſcape taking in the Wars by Seige (as <hi>Gloceſter, Hull</hi> and <hi>Lime</hi> did in our late Wars; but ſcarce any elſe) yet, as it was more through Gods mercy, and the valor, vigilancie and ſtrength of their own <hi>Inhabitants</hi> and other Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers then of their <hi>hired mercenaries</hi>; ſo the length of Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and damages by their very Leaguers, did more indam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, impoveriſh them, then an honorable compoſition with the Enemy at firſt, or the leaving their Towns quite ungarriſon'd would have done; beſides their exemption from all thoſe fears; hardſhips and other miſeries accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying their Leaguers. There was no Garriſon in the late Wars throughout the Nation, but if left ungarriſon'd by either ſide, might with the quarter or half quarter of its unneceſſary expences to make and keep it a <hi>Garriſon,</hi> have avoided all the Miſeries, Loſſes, Devaſtations, Plunders,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60311:9"/>
Preſſures it ſuffered as a Garriſon on both or either ſide, without any great danger or Pillage to the Inhabitants, perſons or Eſtates by either ſide: And half the charges of our Garriſons on both ſides, would have defrayed the whole charges of both the Field Armies, and ended the Wars in far leſſe then half the time they were protracted by means of Garriſons. In brief, our ſmall Caſtles and Garriſons even in times of wars, are, &amp; can be no defence at all, but great Oppreſſions and Grievances to the people and Countrey; our great Garriſons are then but ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences and greater burdens and grievances to the people then ſmaller; yea, all of them after all their fortifications, coſts &amp; expences, are, or may be taken by <note n="*" place="margin">Hab. 1.10.

Hiſtories and experience manifeſt. Upon all which confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, all Stateſmen, Soldiers and intelligent Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Garriſons, who have any brains remaining in their heads, or conſciences in their breſts) muſt ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye (after due deliberation) acknowledge; that <hi>Garriſons even in times of open Wars (eſpecially inteſtine) are ſo far from being a Benefit, Bleſſing, Security or Protection to their Inhabitants and Owners,</hi> that they are the extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Preſſures, Grievances, Curſes, Plagues, Dangers, and moſt deſtructive, deſolating Inſtruments that poſſible can befall them; as bringing all the Furies, Plagues, Miſeries and Extremities of War upon them in perfection, ſo as it were better, ſafer for the Inhabitants of all or moſt Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons at leaſt, and more conducing to their ſafety in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Bodies, Goods, and Freedom from all ſorts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences by War, to continue diſgarriſon'd, and lye open to both parties Armies, as Countrey Villages do, thereby to eſcape all the forementioned Plagues, to which Garriſons are expoſed; or elſe (if there be cauſe) to fire their own houſes before hand, or leave them empty, and flie with their Families, Goods, moneys, and what elſe they have, into Bogs, Woods, Rocks, Caves, Wilderneſſes (as the the wilde <hi>Iriſh, High-landers, Scythians,</hi> and all <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> wanting Garriſons do) and there to ſecure themſelves from the Enemies, till withdrawn thence, routed, or the Wars ended; and thereby to ſave all or moſt they have for their own and Families uſes; then unadviſedly of their own heads, or by the command of any in Power over them, to put themſelves to an extraordinary vaſt expence to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, fortifie, furniſh and maintain Garriſons of mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to no other purpoſe at all, if ſeriouſly conſidered (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe able to defend themſelves without any Mercenaries or Taxes, but meerly voluntary, when and where there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion only and no longer) but meerly to expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all the premiſed Calamities of War and Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, under a <hi>Brainleſſe pretext</hi> and lying <hi>impoſture</hi> of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Perſons and Eſtates from Danger or Moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

by the Enemies or others, the contrary effects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they ever occaſion, both in Peace and War.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In times of open Wars Garriſons bring theſe manifold Evils and Miſeries on the adjacent Countrey-Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and contributing Friends and Neighbors near them, inſtead of any real benefit or protection from them, which they neither do, will nor can afford them in their greateſt needs, though they; voluntarily or by co-action (againſt all Reaſon and Conſcience) largely contribute to their forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and ſupplying for this end. 1, Upon the approach of any Enemy to beſiege them, theſe very Garriſons (their Friends and Protectors) like profeſſed Enemies, oft fire their adjourning Houſes, cut, pull down their Trees, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, Fences, Ditches, Walls, Pales, drive away all their Cattel, carry away all their Goods, Money, Plate, Arms, Houſhold-Stuff, with their very Houſhold Proviſions into their Garriſons; by meer violence againſt their wills, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, cryes, tears, without any price or conſideration at all, to victual and furniſh the Garriſons with neceſſaries againſt the Siege, or elſe to preſerve them (before the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies approach) from the enemies poſſeſſion or Plunder, who elſe would ſeiſe them to their diſadvantage, when as the Enemies for their own better accommodation, would uſe them more favorably, and not plunder them half ſo much as theſe their pretended Friends and new Protectors. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, They are more frequently viſited, Plundred, ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, captivated, fined, ranſomed by the Enemy upon all advantages and occaſions, when there is no Siege, then places more remote from Garriſons, and not contributing to them for protection, upon theſe two accompts. 1. To deprive or ſtraiten theſe Garriſons the more of all provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, neceſſaries, Supplies and Contributions from them, if not totally to withdraw them from them. 2. Becauſe they accompt them their profeſſed Enemies, for being Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buters, Friends, Neighbors to theſe Garriſons, &amp; ſo all they have is lawful Plunder without diſpute, unleſſe they will redeem it, by Fines or Ranſoms, or by paying as<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">

               <pb facs="tcp:60311:11"/>
or greater conſtant Contributions to them and their next adjoyning Garriſons, as they do to thoſe, to live in Peace; being thus made a double prey to both ſides, under colour of Protection by and from both. An intolerable double Preſſure and Impoſition, of which our late Wars afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many experimental Preſidents, in moſt places next to Garriſons; who if the pillaging Enemies be ſtrong at any time, neither will, dare nor ought (as they hold by the Laws of War to ſtir out of their Garriſons to encounter or protect their country neighboring contributors from their Plunder, even under their Walls and view, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off, and loſing the Garriſon to them: Such notable uſeful Protectors are they to the adjacent Countrey, as not to ſtir one foot to help them at their greateſt needs, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to their Enemies ſpoil without reſiſtance, if una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to protect themſelves. Thirdly, They are more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then any others of the Country further of, oppreſſed, vexed, hindred, impoveriſhed, with the ſeiſing impreſting of their Servants, Children, Ploughs, Carts, Horſes, and ſometimes taking them quite away, by both ſides alike, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for publick ſervices or private occaſions, to their vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or undoing. Fourthly, They are more oppreſſed by laboring in, and contributing to theſe Garriſons Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, carrying in their Ammunition and other Proviſions coſt-free, or for little pay &amp; that long ere received) conſtant Contributions to their Garriſons; quartering, Free-quartering, inſolences, outrages, abuſes of the Garriſon Soldiers, of marching Parties of the Field Army it ſelf, when drawn into Quarters, then any parties more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Garriſons, and their perſons more oft Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, Beaten, Wounded, their Wives, Children, Servants, more abuſed, their houſes more ranſacked; Goods, Monies, more frequently ſeiſed and taken away upon malice, jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, pretences by crafty Knaves, Officers and pillaging Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, then others farther off them. Fifthly, When theſe Garriſons are beſieged (as uſually and frequently they are) their Preſſures and Miſeries are beyond expreſſion: The
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60311:11"/>
Men, if well affected to the Garriſons, are all forced by fear or otherwiſe from their Houſes into the Garriſons, Woods or other Counties if not their Wives, Children, and whole Families likewiſe, to avoid the Fury, Preſſures, Troubles, Inſolencies of the beſieging Enemies, who fill all their houſes with their free-quartering rude abuſive Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, eating, drinking up all their Beer and other Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever for man or beaſt, both within &amp; without, not leaving them or their Families bread to eat, or beer to drink, nor yet any Bed, Bolſter, Cuſhion, or ought elſe to reſt their heads on, or Straw to lie in: Tread and eat out all their Graſſe, Hay, Corn ſtanding or cut, with their Horſes: kill, devour, drive away all their Stock, Cattel, which the Garriſons have left them, as good booty; burn up all their Pales, Houſes, Wood, Timber-Trees, fruit-Trees, for firing, &amp; ſoon make them all as poor as <hi>Job</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They are more frequently then any others of the Countrey further off, oppreſſed, vexed, hindred, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed, as aforeſaid; and every new Siege by either party reiterates the ſame or worſe effects as the firſt, to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated beggerie, as many late experiments freſh in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds about <hi>Plimouth, Exceſter, Lime, Taunton, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol, Gloceſter, Worceſter, Oxford, York, Hull</hi> (whoſe firſt Siege produced the <hi>drowning of all the Countrey round</hi> it in the beginning of our Wars) and moſt beſieged <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons</hi> evidence beyond contradiction; which miſeries Countries void of <hi>Garriſons,</hi> or remoter from them, doe not ſuſtain; the quarterings on them being neither ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, thick, long-laſting, or oppreſſive as in places next to Garriſons, eſpecially in Sieges. 7. In theſe Garriſond Leaguers their Gardens, Grounds, Orchards Houſes, are frequentlie deſtroyed, digged up, or pulled down, their Trees and Timber felled, their Men, Women, Children, Ploughs, Carts, Horſes forced day after day, to toile and labour in making Trenches, Sconces, Batteries, Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees, Mines, Redoubts, or carry Timber, Proviſions, Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,

Armes, and other Baggage, which remoter Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes are free from; and themſelves would be ſo too, but for theſe Garriſons, which occaſion and enforce theſe Sieges. 8. If the Oppoſites Field Armie or ſtrong Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from them during the Sieges, approach to raiſe them, or to victual or relieve the Garriſons, the oppreſſions of the adjoyning Parts ate then doubled, trebled, and ſpread wider round about theſe Garriſons, till the whole Country, ten, twenty, or thirty miles about, by the long quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lying of ſo many Armies, Parties upon them, and Marches to and fro to take or relieve the Garriſons, be quite undone and eaten out; and ſo one or both Armies neceſſitated to ſeek out freſh quarters; or the Garriſons taken or relieved. After this the neceſſitated neer-ſtarved Garriſons requiring new ſupplies of all ſorts, if not taken, extort them from the adjacent Countries, if they be to be had above ground, which addes much to all their former afflictions: And then again ſome other new Sieges or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions drawing one or both Armies thither afreſh, ſo ſoon as the miſerable Country People have gotten any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, they are, to their endleſſe vexation, expoſed afreſh to all the fformer miſeries of Wars, Sieges, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver eaſed of them till the Garriſons either be demoliſhed or disbanded. From all which experimentall Arguments, and real Demonſtrations of undoubted verity, all ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men whatſoever, and no doubt the whole Nation, Country, Inhabitants of Garriſons, with all conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſelf-denying <hi>Stateſmen</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> who really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend or affect the peoples true weal, eaſe, or ſafety (the <hi>Supream Law,</hi> the <hi>principal end of War, Peace, Garriſons, Armies, Parliaments, Councils, Magistrates, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and higher Powers</hi>) as the <hi>Army-Officers</hi> themſelves remonſtrated, in the very worſt of their <hi>Remonſtrances, Nov.</hi> 20 1648. making it the <hi>Baſis</hi> of all their exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant unparalleled Demands therein, &amp; of their violent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in purſuit of them ever ſince) will and muſt

So every able private perſon, Family, Pariſh, Town County, Aſſociation (and by like conſequence the whole Nation) will better, cheaper, and with leſſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by far, defend and ſecure themſelves by their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercenary perſons &amp; Arms voluntarily united according to their reſpective abilities, without any general forced Taxes and illegal Exciſes impoſed and continued on them againſt their wills, then any Mercenary Officers and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers whatſoever, (who making onely a Trade and Gain of War wil therefore ſpin it out as long as the Nation or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have any moneys or Eſtates to pay and inrich them) and will ſooner conclude and ſettle Peace upon their own terms upon all overtures and occaſions, then <hi>Mercenaries,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:60311:14"/>
neither deſire nor intend our publike Peace in reality but interrupt it all they may when neer concluded, (as in the late Treaty) with armed violence both againſt King and Parliament. Uupon which grounds our <hi>Ancestors</hi> never uſually entruſted any Mercenary Armies, but themſelves alone with their own and the Kingdoms defence, ſcarce ever impoſed any Taxes on the people by publike Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Authority in any civil Wars and very rarely (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Subſidy, or fifteen now and then) for the Kingdoms defence againſt forraign <hi>Invaſion</hi>; but onely for their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſive, Defenſive</hi> Forraign Wars in <hi>France</hi> or elſewhere.

            <p n="8">8. That Maritine Garriſons, Forts, Blockhouſes at the entrance of our Harbors (as <hi>Pendennis</hi> and S. <hi>Mawdits Castles</hi> at the mouth of <hi>Falmouth</hi> Haven, <hi>Harwich,</hi> and others of that nature) are altogether uſeleſs, unneceſſary expenſive charges to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike, unable to hinder the ingreſs, egreſs, or regreſs of any warlike ſhip, ſhips, or Navy into the Harbors, much leſs to ſinck them, with all their Cannon-ſhot, which <hi>I</hi> ſhall thus demonſtrate. 1. In dark nights, and miſty days, mornings, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venings (which take up neer halfe the ſpace every yeere) they can neither clearly ſee nor diſcern any ſhip or veſſel paſſing into or out of their harbors, muchleſſe then hinder their free ingreſs or egreſs by ſhot or otherwiſe, when they cannot ſo much as ſee them. 2. In clear ſunſhine dayes, and moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine nights, any ſmall veſſels (much more then reſolute men of War, and whole Squadrons, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies) may ſafely paſs and repaſs into or out of theſe harbors, or anchor in them without any great danger, harm, or ſinking by their Cannons; which ſtanding for the moſt part high upon the Land (eſpecially at new Flood, half Tide or Ebbe) and not levell with the Sea at full tide; and being likewiſe not halfe ſo many in number, not ſo large
<pb facs="tcp:60311:15"/>
in boar, as moſt Men of Warre now carry in one tire or ſide, diſcharged for the moſt part at rovers by unskilfull Gunners and Matroſſes one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and fixed upon one Platform, whence they cannot eaſily or ſpeedily bee removed, can hardly in ſeveral ſhoots ſo much as hit any one ſingle veſſell, much leſſe hurt or ſink it in its paſſage under ſaile by theſe forts and blockhouſes, being paſt their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and danger at the firſt diſcharge of their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons over againſt them, and quite out of it ere they can be recharged; much leſſe then can they ſtopp, ſinke or miſchiefe an whole Navy or Squadron of Men of Warre, which I ſhall demonſtrate by ſeveral inſtances old and new, beyond contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 1. Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> in his famous voyage to the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> with a ſmall ſquadron of ſhips, entred five of the chiefe Ports the Spaniards there held, took and fired their ſhips there riding under their Caſtles, Forts, Blockhouſes, and pillaged their Towns themſelves, notwithſtanding all their Cannons and Artiliry playing upon his ſhips, both from their Forts, Caſtles, Blockhouſes and Ships there riding, and that without the loſſe, ſinking or ſpoyling of any one of his Veſsels: And ſome other Engliſh Sea. Captains then and ſince did the like, as Mr. <hi>Harkluit</hi> in his printed <hi>Voyages</hi> at large relates. 2. Our Engliſh Navy in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign, in their expedition againſt <hi>Cadez,</hi> tooke the whole Iland and City in one day, burnt and tooke all their ſhips, treaſure, magazine and ordnance there, notwithſtanding all their forts, block-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, numerous mounted Cannons diſcharged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60311:15"/>
them, without the loſs or ſpoil of any one ſhip, and of very few men, as Mr. <hi>Cambden, Speed,</hi> and others inform us in her life. 3. The <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> both in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>West-Indies</hi> have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently entred the <hi>Spaniſh Havens</hi> with their ſhips, in deſpite of all their Cannons, Forts and Blockhou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, anchored in them, and pillaged, fired, took the Spaniſh Veſsels riding in them under their Caſtles, without the ſinking of any one man of Warre by their Cannons firing, as the Hiſtory of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, Purchas</hi> and <hi>Hackluit</hi> in their Voyages, and others record. 4. The Dutch men of Warre, and other Veſsels have ſundry times in a drunken <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado,</hi> at mid-day paſsed in and out of our <hi>Harbors</hi> at <hi>Harwich, Plimouth, Falmouth,</hi> &amp; <hi>Southampton,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtriking fail to the Forts there, and gone away without any hurt, danger, ſtop, notwithſtanding all their cannon-ſhot to bring them in, as <hi>I</hi> have heard by many credible eye-witneſses. 5. <hi>Sir Robert Manſel</hi> in his Voyage againſt <hi>Algier,</hi> with his boats fired ſundry of their ſhips, drawn on ſhore under their Caſtle-walls &amp; blockhouſes, without the loſs of one boat or ſhip, and very few men, notwithſtanding many thouſands of cannon and more of musket-ſhot from the caſtle and ſhips, as Captain <hi>George Carteret</hi> who ſaw it, and was active in it, informed mee whiles <hi>I</hi> was priſoner in <hi>Jerſey.</hi> 6. Since our late unhappy wars, two very ſmall ſquadrons of our ſhips ſucceſſively landed the Parliaments forces under the very blockhouſes and forts of <hi>Scilly</hi> and <hi>Jerſey,</hi> without the loſs or hurt of one ſhip or barque by their Cannon ſhot, and with the loſs of very few
<pb facs="tcp:60311:16"/>
men, and reduced the Caſtles and Ilands too with a farre leſſer land-force then the King had there in arms to defend them. Since this, <hi>Sir George Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough</hi> with a ſmal Navy entred into the chief part &amp; harbor at the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> took &amp; brought out thence fourteen or more Dutch Veſſels, and others riding therein, paſſing and repaſsing, without the loſs, ſinking, hurt, of any one ſhip, or ſlaughter of one man, within half piſtol ſhot of their caſtle and blockhouſes, which plaid upon his ships all the time with their cannon &amp; musket ſhot; and ſoon after he reduced the whole Iland notwithſtanding all their forts and forces; as the printed <hi>Diurnalls</hi> and <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of its taking, and <hi>Letters</hi> thence inform us. 7. Since this I read in our <hi>Diurnalls,</hi> that Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> took ſome of our Merchants ſhips riding under the Caſtles and Blockhouſes of our Engliſh Plantations in the Indies, which played upon him with their cannon without hurt, he returning them two cannon ſhot for one, and riding within musket ſhot of them without any fear or hurt. 8. To come home to <hi>Pendennis Castle</hi> and <hi>St. Mawdits,</hi> ſo much cryed up as the moſt uſefull and conſiderable of all other: Whiles they were in the Kings pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſince theſe warres, as the inhabitants and ſome ſouldiers aſſure me, a ſingle man of warre of the Parliaments party in the day-time entred the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, boorded, took and carried away thence a rich ſhip there riding in the view of both the Garriſons, notwithſtanding all their cannon ſhot and block-houſes, without any harm at all, ſhee ſhooting as faſt at the caſtles as they ſhot at her, and ſo depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60311:16"/>
with her prize. 9. Since my impriſonment in <hi>Pendennis Caſtle,</hi> a Turkiſh man of Warr at mid-day, in the view of all the Garriſon, and my ſelfe, came up to the mouth of the Harbor, and very neer the Blockhouſe, took a great Engliſh Lighter of thirty tun, ſunk the veſſell in the place, and carried away ſome twelve perſons in it priſoners into <hi>Sally</hi> or <hi>Tunis</hi>; after which, she came cloſe up to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor two or three mornings together till chaſed away from thence by a Man of Warre; One ſtout ſhip of Warre being a better guard againſt Pyrates and Sea-enemies then all the Maritine forts and garriſons, being able to purſue, fight and take them, which no forts or garriſons can do. Not long after a little Pink, not above nine or ten tun, anchored ſome three dayes together juſt between <hi>Pendennis Caſtle</hi> and <hi>St. Mawdits,</hi> to carry away <hi>Tinne,</hi> as was ſuppoſed; Sir <hi>George Aſcough</hi> ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within view of the Caſtles with his whole fleet towards Plimouth, (ſome eight days before his fight with <hi>Ruttier</hi>) ſent four men of warre to convey ſuch ſhips as were in the Harbour to Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth; two of them came into the Harbour, the other two plied up and downe at the mouth of it, till the other two came out of the Harbour to them: This little Pink thereupon hoyſed ſaile, as if ſhe were bound for Plymouth with them, without any diſcharge or leave from the Caſtles; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſhot two warning pieces over, and under her, to bring her in for this affront, and to make her pay for the ſhot and cuſtome of Tinne, which they imagined ſhe had ſtollen; I looking on, the
<pb facs="tcp:60311:17"/>
Captain, Gunners, and ſouldiers told mee, They would warrant mee ſhee would come in and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; but I obſerving her courſe, told them, <hi>Shee would no more come in to their lure then a wilde Hawke got looſe</hi>; whereupon both Caſtles diſcharged their cannons in earneſt, to hit, ſink, or bring her back through fear, but ſhee in deſpite of them (though there were two men of warre before, and two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde her under ſaile) got away from them all without any hurt or ſtop, the whole Garriſon looking on. VVhereupon I laughing at their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and uſeleſsneſs of theſe caſtles, (ſerving only to ſhoot away <note n="*" place="margin">They have often diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons or more at a time to ſhips coming in, &amp; the ſhips as many to them, ſince my impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there: A ſtrange prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality!</note> powder and bullet in ſalutes and frollicks) told them, <hi>That our wiſe Stateſmen and the Kingdome were very much overſeen to keep two Caſtles, three or four Blockhouſes, ſo many ſcore Cannons, Gunners, Souldiers, and Matroſses there, as coſt them eight or ten thouſand pounds a year, under pretence to ſecure the Haven and Nation againſt Enemies and Pirates, when they could not at noon day (as they now ſaw by experience) ſo much as stay, take, hurt or ſink one little Pink of nine or ten tun with foure or five ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men onely, and not one Gun in her, when as there were four Men of War under ſail ſo near her, and ſhe had stolen Cuſtomes: Much leſſe then could they ſtop, hurt ſinck</hi> any <hi>stout man of War,</hi> or <hi>an whole ſquadron of Ships or Navy,</hi> or hinder <hi>them from entring the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, riding or landing there, and returning at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, their Pieces and Blockhouſes not commanding one half quarter of the Harbor when entred, not being able to hurt or ſink them in their entry or retiring,</hi> as I clearly demonſtrated
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60311:17"/>
to them, then and afterwards, eſpecially by theſe unanſwerable experiments in our late ſea Fights. <hi>Collonel Blake</hi> (my Countrey-man) in his firſt ſea Fight with <hi>Van Trump,</hi> as his and others printed Letters relate, had many ſcores (if not hundreds) of broad ſides diſcharged againſt his ſhip by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> at neareſt diſtance, by far greater better Cannons, Cannoneers and Tyres of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, charged with Chain and <hi>Croſs<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Therefore queſtionleſs ſo many thouſand Cannon ſhot diſcharged againſt any other ſtout ſingle ſhip or man of War from theſe Caſtles and Blockhouſes at greater diſtance, uncertainty, and higher level, with ſmaller Ordnance balls, by worſer Guners can neither ſink nor ſpoil her, much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſ ſink, h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

(And one ſince theſe <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> penned namely <hi>General Blakes</hi> fireing the <hi>Turkiſh ſhips</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under their very ſtrongeſt Caſtle Walls, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their cannons, blockhouſes, ſhips playing upon our ſhips, aſsaulting them and beating down their caſtle about their ears, with the cannon from our ſhips, without the loſs, ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſpoile of any of our ſhips.)

Which learned queſtions ſtanding the Nation in very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand pounds every year in Gariſons now kept up, as much concern the peoples ſecurity from Enemies, as the Miniſters interrogating of children formerly in the Church, <hi>What is your name?

And to maintain near a thouſand <hi>Block-headed</hi> ſlothfull-<hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> in <hi>Blockhouſes</hi> and <hi>Garriſons</hi> only to ſhoot away above ſix or ſeaven thouſand pounds worth of powder in Courtſhip, and Frolicks to ſhips, and Viſitors every year, who deſerve rather caſhiering for this their prodigal and onely Dutie, for which they receive great conſtant pay. Certainly their Country pay-<hi>Maſters</hi> live not by ſuch idle, uſeleſſe, fruitleſſe, rare duties; but by hard ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying, ſweating, labouring night and day in their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt lawfull callings uſefull for the publick (the whole profits whereof theſe idle <hi>Lurdanes</hi> muſt ſtill monthly devoure for ſuch ridiculous ſervices, and new kinde of <hi>Catechiſing</hi> the people <hi>ex officio</hi> like our caſhiered unprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Curates;) and ſo muſt theſe Officers and Souldiers too, if they cannot otherwiſe live aſwell as they. 3. How did they live and maintain themſelves before they were liſted Souldiers? Surely not as now, but like other chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people, by labouring daily in their lawfull callings, living frugally, ſoberly, obediently like others of their equals, not in ſuch idleneſſe, luxury, pride, &amp; ſtate as ſince: And is it not poſſible that they may, yea juſt &amp; equal that they ſhould thus live and maintain themſelves now, and not ſtill live like <hi>idle Drones</hi> in great ſloath, pompe, ſtate,

and honour upon the honey of the poore painfull <hi>Bees</hi> 4. How do many hundreds of formerly <hi>disbanded Officers, Souldiers</hi> now live and maintain themſelves, who did as much, and good ſervice as thoſe now in pay? Doubtleſſe by returning to the diligent exerciſe of their former cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or ſome other good imployments, or going to ſome lawfull forraign Wars. 5. If any old Officers and Souldiers in preſent ſervice be ſo poor, that they know not yet how to live if they be now disbanded, certainly it is through their own ill husbandry, pride, or prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality; never Officers or Souldiers in the world being more royally, duly, juſtly paid and rewarded (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Civill War) than they have been; whereby thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of them (eſpecially Generals, Colonells, Captains, and Superiour Officers, with many inferiour ones likewiſe) are grown exceeding rich and wealthy over what they were before the Wars (which have undone moſt others) and are lately beyond expectation, become the greateſt Purchaſers in the Nation of the richeſt publick and Private <hi>Mannors,</hi> Seates, Revenues, Offices; this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill War being the richeſt trade they ever yet met withall in their lives, which makes them ſo unwilling now to give it over; &amp; to continue theſe poor unthrifty Souldiers ſtill in pay till they grow as rich as theſe their fellowes, is to be worſe husbands for the Nation for the future, than theſe unthriving Officers and Souldiers (who have not yet gotten enough to live by the Wars) have been for themſelves in time paſt, and that onely to maintain and enrich them with the whole Nations ruine. 6. The plain meaning of thoſe who make this Demand is, that they expect and intend our mercinary Armies, and Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall by one means or other, be continued in pay, and our Wars not ended, our peace not ſettled till <hi>Doomſday,</hi> or at leaſt ſo long as the people have either Lands, ſtock, goods, or moneys left, to pay heavy unceaſing Taxes and Exciſes for them to live upon, at that high, laſie rate as now they do.
