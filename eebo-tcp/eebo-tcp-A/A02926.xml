            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Chriſte his kingdome, to the ouerthrowe &amp; vtter diſtruction of blindnes, error, Popery, ſuperſtition, and of all the tyrannie of Anti-chriſte, haue perſwaded me to accomplyſhe their great and earneſt deſire, and to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late into our vulgare tongue, this little and neceſſary treatiſe of <hi>Himmenge,</hi> called <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes,</hi> wherein what paynes I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I had rather a great deale the learned in reading ſhould iudge, then that I would ſpeake any one worde of my ſelfe.

               <head>¶ The firſt deuiſion.</head>
               <p>THe moſt common deuiſion of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is this, whereas it is deuided into the old and newe Teſtamente, which being ioyned together, are in the Greeke tongue
<pb facs="tcp:17101:9"/>
by a certaine figure called <hi>Antonomaſia)</hi> named the Bible, which alſo is therefore ſometimes called an Inſtrumente, becauſe that by it, as by an Inſtrument, or readye meane, the holy will and woorde of God is broughte and declared vnto vs. Nowe the Epithetes, or names of old and newe, are taken from the crycumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of tymes. For it is called the old Teſtament, becauſe in reſpecte of the tyme it was the firſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it is called the newe, for that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the time, it was the laſt. But if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man ſhould thincke this difference to be taken from the diuerſitye of couenauntes, it were no great matter: yet the firſt reaſon is crewer and fitter for this place. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wythſtanding they which call the olde and the newe Teſtamente, by the name of bookes, do vſe the word Teſtament contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the common vſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>¶ The ſubdiuiſion.</head>
               <p>THE olde Teſtamente is called of the Iewes, <hi>[Eſrim veorba]</hi> and that of his number of Bookes. For they doe receyue xxiiii. Bookes of vndoubted aucthority,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17101:9"/>
which they deuide into foure partes, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The firſt is called of theym <hi>Thora,</hi> that is to ſaye, the Lawe or doctrine, and it doth contayne fiue Bookes, to witte Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, Exodus, Leuiticus, Numeri and Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomium, which the Grecians call alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is to ſay, A volume con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning fiue bookes. The ſecond parte is called of them <hi>Rheſconim Nebiim,</hi> that is to ſaye, the former Prophetes, and this part hath foure bookes, to witte, the booke of Ioſua, the booke of Iudges, the booke of Samuell and the bookes of the kinges.</p>
               <p>The thirde parte is, <hi>Acharonim Nebijm,</hi> that is to ſaye, of the latter Prophetes, and it doth comprehende foure bookes, Eſaye, Ieremye, Ezechiell, and the booke of the twelue Prophetes, which they call the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, as are Oſee, Ioell, Amos, Abdias, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, Micheas, Nahum, Baruch, Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Haggeus, Zacharie, and Malachie. The fourthe parte is <hi>Chetubim,</hi> that is to ſaye, of the holye writers, and it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne eleuen bookes, Paralippominon, the Pſalter, the Prouerbes of Salomon, Iob, Ruthe, Eccleſiaſtes, the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Ieremye, the Songe of Songes,
<pb facs="tcp:17101:10"/>
Haſter, Daniell, Eſoras, and Nehemiah, which two latter, are taken for one booke. So that wee haue 24. bookes of the olde Teſtamente of vndoubted auctority, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into 4. partes, or orders. Notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding beſides theſe bookes they haue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, alſo which they do call <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> that is to ſaye, ſecrete or hidden Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, therefore ſo called, becauſe they were not brought forth into the light, to confirme any opinion or doctrine. Of this ſorte are Ieſus the ſonne of Syrach, Iudeth, Tobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, the bookes of Machabees, the wiſedome of Salomon, Baruch, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcribe of Ieremie, and this is the deuiſion of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after the maner of the Hebrewes and the Greatians.</p>
               <p>The new Teſtamente is deuided into 4. partes. The firſt contayneth the foure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſtes. The ſecond the actes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. The third, the 21. Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, that is to ſaye, 14. of Paule, 3. of Iohn, 2 of Peter, one of Iames, and one of Iudas. The fourth part contayneth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalips of S. Iohn. Moreouer all the bookes of the newe Teſtament, are founde in the <hi>Cannon,</hi> excepte the ſeconde Epiſtle
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17101:10"/>
of S. Peter, the ſeconde and thirde Epiſtle of Iohn, and the Epiſtles of Iames, and Iude, with the Apocalipſe. Some alſo do put the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes out of the <hi>Cannon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſomwhat ſeemeth to be added, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the vſe and profite of this diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rehearſed: for it little auayleth dilligently to diſtinguiſhe, vnleſſe thou perceyue alſo what profite proceedeth thereof. Firſt of all therefore the diſtinction profitely much to iudge truly of the auctoritie of Holye bookes: for all the bookes of the olde and new Teſtament, are of an vndoubted fayth, and are of great force to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme opinions: except thoſe which I ſayde before were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> which truly may be reade wyth profite. But in diſputations of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous they are not to be alleaged. For thoſe bookes only are of an vndoubted auctority, which are truly attributed to Moſes, to the Prophetes, to the Euangeliſtes, and to the Apoſtles. Wherefore ſince that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue and pure Church, hath doubted of the auctors of the ſecrete Scriptures, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> they are of right reiected, when as they are alleaged by the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
<pb facs="tcp:17101:11"/>
againſt the wrytinges of the Prophets and the Apoſtles. There is alſo another commoditie of this diſtinction, for it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to haue a certain order of bookes, that. Students may diſtribute the reading of the Bible into certayne times, as it ſhal ſeeme to be profitable for theym, to learne the holy bookes. The third commoditye is that a certaine waye or meanes maye be had (whether thou preach or interprete the ſacred Scriptures in the ſcholes) of recy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or alledging y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Taſtimonyes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that the place of the teſtimonye, may be ſhewed as it were wyth the finger, when as the aucthour of the wrytinge, and the Chapter of the Booke is named and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed.</p>

               <p>THe deuines in the ſcholes, do deuide the bookes both of the old and newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, into Legall, Hiſtoricall, Sapientiall, and Propheticall bookes. As of the olde Teſtamente, the fiue bookes of Moſes are Legall: the bookes called Hiſtoricall are Ioſua, the booke of Iudges, Ruth, the 4.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17101:11"/>
bookes of the Kings, Iob, the two bookes of the Machabees. The Pſalter, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbes, Eccleſiaſtes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Song of Songes, the booke of Wiſedome, Eccleſiaſticus, are Sapiential. And the xvii.

Epiſtles of the Apoſtles Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piential: and the Apocalipſe of S. Iohn to be Propheticall. This by no colour maye bee excuſed: for it is altogether abſurde in as much as it is of them applyed to bookes. But if they woulde applye this theyr ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile deuiſion to the thinges (as I thincke) auncient wryters haue done, it mighte per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture be borne wythall: but becauſe it is manifeſtlye falſe, as it is applyed to boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, I wil not in ſo euident a matter, make anye longer confutation. Furthermore the vſe of this deuiſion as it is applyed to thinges, perhappes maye be heare in, that learners in readinge maye wyſelye put

               <p>For the holy hiſtorye ought to be the glaſſe of a Chriſtian lyfe. For it doth contayne many examples of true godlyneſſe, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, of Fayth, of Patience, of calling &amp;c.

The difference of doctrine verelye, dothe cauſe vs not to confounde raſhlye wyth the Papiſtes the Lawe and the Goſpell, who dreame the Goſpell to be the newe Lawe, but they are deceyued: For neyther the Prophetes, nor the Apoſtles, teache anye other thinge then Moſes doth, althoughe in their manner of teachinge there is great difference. For Moyſes committeth to wrytinge the doctrine delyuered, as it were by hande from GOD, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: whiche doth contayne the perfecte worſhippinge of GOD, but hee is more obſcure and darke then the Prophetes.</p>
               <p>The Prophetes are the interpretours of Moſes, for that which Moſes doth note, as it were wyth certayne Aphoriſmes, that is to ſaye, briefely and ſummarilye, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes doe expounde in whole Sermons. But becauſe that thing which the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes did foretell, the Apoſtles ſawe before their eyes, therefore are the Apoſtles made plainer interpreters of Moſes, and of the

Prophetes. Who ſo obſerueth this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſhall reade with greater profite, the wrytinges of Moſes, of the Prophetes and of the Apoſtles.

Let the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17101:16"/>
firſt care be to referre euery interpretation to the proportion of fayth, from the which if the interpretation doe diſagree, it ſhal be accompted falſe.

For thoſe thinges are ſayde to be done accordinge to the proportion which are made by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to another thinge, or els when other thinges are framed by the compariſon of others. Wherevppon when Paule doth commaunde that Prophecye, that is to ſay, the interpretation of the Scriptures, ought to be proportionable to fayth, hee wylleth that the interpretour ſhoulde haue reſpecte to the firſte principles of Religion, which are plaine and manifeſt, as conſerninge the lawe and the promiſes of the Goſpell, with the which euery interpretation oughte to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Wherefore the Papiſtes in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb facs="tcp:17101:17"/>
of this ſaying: (If thou wilt enter into life keepe the commaundementes) Do departe from the proportion of fayth, when they do conclude of this ſayinge, That men may obtaine ſaluation by their owne proper workes, for this interpretation doth ſtriue with cleare and manifeſt principles: As are theſe, The ſeede of the woman ſhall breake the Serpentes heade, alſo, The Lambe of God, that taketh awaye the ſinnes of the worlde: and againe, If righteouſnes be of the law Chriſte dyed in vaine.</p>
               <p>And alwayes after this maner the mind of the interpretour ought to be bent, to the firſte principles of our Religion, from the which hee ſhall not ſuffer hymſelfe to be drawne awaye by any Sophiſticall reaſon: For hee that countemneth this proportion of Fayth, commended of S. Paule to the interpretour, and els where doth ſeeke an interpretation contrary to the rule of faith, let him be aſſured that hee ſhalbe plagued of GOD.

the difference of the phraſe, or manner of ſpeache. Therefore leaſte here vnwares wee may be deceyued, oftentimes a learned interpretour is needeful. The ſecond cauſe, is the iudgement of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of thinges: For he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> perceyueth not the maner of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſhal certainly very ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: as they are which recyte out of Paule, this ſaying againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iuſtification of faith: Not the hearers of the Law but the doers ſhalbe iuſtifyed. Here if they had conſidered the maner of the handling they might haue ſeene Paule in that place, not to haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of the iuſtification of works, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men ſhoulde be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted iuſtifyed throughe woorkes before God, when as Paule there laboureth to confute this opinion againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of fayth.

The third cauſe ought to be the witnes of a true interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for when the hearers perceiue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations to be brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of God, &amp; do ſee the agreement of the word of God, and of the pure Church with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation:

               <p>BEfore I come to the kinds of Sermons I will briefely touche the partes, which may very well be counted foure in nomber, the Exordium or beginninge, the Treatiſe, the Digreſſion end the Concluſion. The
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17101:23"/>
Exordium in this place, is the beginning of the ſermon, after inuocation and prayer is made, and the holye leſſon, or text read and recited, which wee purpoſe to handle and to intreate of. This may very aptly ſomtimes be taken vppon the occaſion, or oportunity, ſomtimes from other cyrcumſtaunces. And it ſhould be ſo handled that it might be, as it were a certaine way, to that thing which we minde to intreate of. It muſt be modeſt, briefe and graue to thende it maye obtaine the good will of the hearers, maye ſtyrre them vppe by eaſines of teaching, and maye keepe theym attentiue. The treatiſe or manner of handlinge, doth alter throughe diuerſity of theames, wherby it happeneth that ſometimes it is contente with a deuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and an expoſition: and that when it is a ſimple theame. Diuiſion is a ſentence by the which we briefely declare what things wee will ſpeake of, this is commended for the breuitye, the perfectnes and fewnes of words, for the which aſke counſaile &amp; helpe of the precepts of Oratours. Expoſition is a ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, wherin the parts of a diuiſion are declared, and it is three fould. Synthetical, Dicretical, and Analyticall, of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb facs="tcp:17101:24"/>
wee ſhall intreate more at large.</p>
               <p>This expoſition is ſometimes ſimple, when as no argumentes are added: ſometimes mixte, when the reaſons of the partes of an expoſition are intermingled: ſometimes wyth deuiſion. Ye may ſeeke out the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the partes of deuiſion, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the opinions of others ſtryuing with ours, and that ſo often as the theame is compounded. The Wyſedome of the preacher ſhal eaſlye iudge, when the confu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation ſhould go before the confirmation, &amp; when it ſhould follow: it muſt go before of neceſſitye when the mindes of the hearers are before hande poſſeſſed and holden wyth errour: for they cannot receiue the truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are deliuered from the errour and falſehode. Digreſſion is a ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by the doctrine is applyed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearers, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forting, chiding, fearing &amp; admoniſhing.

This doth both brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rehearſe the ſumme of the thinges which are handled, and doth alſo fiere vp the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the hearers with the commendation of the doctrine expounded, and by ſhewyng the vſe thereof. Now let vs come to ſpeake of the kindes of a ſermon. There are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally tw<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o kyndes of preachinges, the one appertayneth to teaching: the other to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. That whiche appertayneth to teaching, is of ſimple places, and thoſe as well of perſones as of thinges, and of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces compounded, of generall ſentences, and particuler argumentes. The other whiche appertayneth to exhortation, is diuided into three partes, for either it perſuadeth, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh, or comforteth. This difference or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of ſermons may be proued. Firſt of the diuerſitie of hearers, to whome the ſermon ſhalbe applied. For either they are altogether rude, and muſt bee taughte, to whome the firſt kinde dothe appertayne, or els they are not rude, but rather feble and
<pb facs="tcp:17101:25"/>
faint harted, and muſt be lifted vp with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations: or els ſlowe, and they muſt bee pricked forwarde: or els contemners, and are to be chaſtened with threatninges. To theſe foure kindes of hearers al the ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Chriſte are to be derected, for ſometyme hee teacheth the ignoraunt whiche are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to learne, and ſometime it comforteth, and ſtyrreth vp the faint harted: nowe hee exhorteth the ſlower ſorte, and nowe with threatninges, he terrifieth ſuche as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and vngodly. Hereof we may euery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where eaſelye finde exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples in the hiſtorie of the Goſpell. Agayne, the ſame is proued by the vſe and cuſtome of the holy Scripture: For Paule wryteth thus in his ſeconde epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to Timothe, and the thyrde chapter. All ſcripture geuen by inſpiration of God, is profitable to improue, to amende, and to inſtructe in righteouſnes that the name of God may be perfecte and prepared vnto all good workes. Here the foure folde vſe of the ſcripture is declared, and that with foure woordes whiche are in the Greeke tongue named <hi>Didaſcalia, Elenchos, Epanorthoſis,</hi> and <hi>Paidia. Didaſcalia,</hi> is to be handled in the firſt kinde, that is to ſay, in that whiche
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17101:25"/>
appertaineth to teaching. <hi>Elenchos,</hi> hath chi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding. <hi>Epanorthoſis</hi> is when the fal is lifted vp, and made ſtedfaſt, whiche manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to bee done with conſolations and comfortes. <hi>Paidia,</hi> is the teaching of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whoſe chiefeſt office is, to perſwade to goodnes, and honeſtie, and to diſſuade from wicked and filthie thynges. Our diſtinction therefore agreeth with the varietie of the hearers, with the enſample of Chriſte, and with the tradition of Paule. But becauſe the hearers are mixed in publicke aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that the prophetes, Chriſt, thapoſtles, &amp; all the godly miniſters of the worde doe oftentimes builde &amp; frame out of doctrine, conſolations, perſwaſions, and chidings, all which the force of doctrine hathe as it were ioyned with it: euen as I haue ſayde before, is done in the wrytinges of the Prophetes and Apoſtles: whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples it becommeth godlye miniſters to folowe in makyng of Sermones. Neyther is our diſtinction to bee diſallowed whiche doth appertayne to the nature of teachynge of thynges, and doth ſhewe what order and waye is to be obſerued in makyng of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones, although ſometymes thoſe thynges
<pb facs="tcp:17101:26"/>
whiche I haue named as acceſſaries, and impertinent, are applied by the figure of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, which thing who ſo euer doth not obſerue, can neyther make their owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons well, neyther iudge of other mens, nor yet beare them awaye in mynde.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, wraſtling w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the greatnes of ſinne, &amp; of the wrath of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:17101:28"/>Therfore let vs take vnto vs true examples, and let vs leaue fayned examples for the Poetes, whiche are not to be handled of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche are called by ſaint Paule the Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes of the miſteries of God. The ſacred ſcripture and the true hiſtorie doth miniſter examples ſufficiently: as of Abraham, Iob, of Ioſeph, of Manaſſes, of Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene, of the theefe which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted, &amp; of ſuch like: for out of ſuch as theſe ar, we may not onely reache the hearers true godlines, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of liuing according to their kynde of calling. Therfore the godly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher muſt remember to ſhewe forthe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples profitable vnto godlines, and not thoſe whiche ſeeme to cauſe diſperation. Nowe it is time that we declare thoſe thinges wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee haue ſpoken with a playne example. And becauſe none can be more famouſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the example of Abraham, I wil lay that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you to be examined. Paule ſayth, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham beleued God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſnes. In this place Paule bringeth forth the example of Abraham, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for doctrines ſake, and from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce draweth foorth not only the firme and ſure doctrine of righteouſnes, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17101:28"/>
of ſaith: and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence doth ſhewe of what holines of life the beleuing man oughte to be. After this manner let vs learne, by the immitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Paule to obſerue two thinges in examples to witte, the facte in it ſelfe, and then the circumſtances of the perſone, and of the facte. The facte in it ſelfe doth teache that true righteouſnes doth conſiſt of faith, in the promiſes of God. The circumſtances of the perſone, and of the facte, doe put vs in minde of many thinges. Firſt that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of neceſſitie is not required to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: For Abraham was iuſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Circumciſion, but afterwards circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was added, as a ſeale of righteouſnes whiche is of faith. Secondly, the profeſſion of Abraham, his life before iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was receiued of God, not for his owne proper merites, or workes going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but by the onely goodnes of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in this example of Abraham is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that iuſtification of faith, pertaineth equally to all. For Abraham was iuſtified before men were diſcerned by any outward workes. Out of this circumſtance the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets without doubt haue drawen and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their ſermons, of the callinge of the
<pb facs="tcp:17101:29"/>
Gentiles. Fourthly, that the ceremonies of Moyſes are not required of them that are to be iuſtified: for euen as Abraham was iuſtified without them, ſo they that ſhalbe iuſtified after his example, muſt not require them to the accompliſhement of their iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Fiftly, that righteouſnes doth come without the morall lawe, and the workes commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the decaloge or two tables, for if we be iuſtified according to Abraham his example, &amp; he was iuſtified many yeares that is to ſay, 430. yeares before the lawe: truly it can not bee that righteouſnes is of the lawe. But if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould obiecte that the morall lawe was from the beginning, &amp; that Abraham did not wante it, the anſwer is eaſye: for no rewarde is due to workes without the couenaunt of God. For workes are not meritorious of their owne worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but by the acceptation of God and by reaſon of the couenaunt: Therefore the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of Paule abideth firme and ſtedfaſt: Abraham is iuſtified by the fayth of promiſe before the couenaunt of woorkes was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed: to wytte, the man that dothe them ſhall liue in them. Wherefore he is iuſtified by fayth &amp; not by workes. Sixtly, that the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17101:29"/>
true and iuſtifieng fayth, is a certayne full aſſuraunce, whiche is not ſubdued by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of reaſon, but ſtedfaſtly beleueth that he whiche promyſeth cannot lie, how ſoeuer the whole nature of thynges may ſeeme to gayne ſaye it. And that fayth hath good workes, and obedience towardes God ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it, and that nothing ought to bee eſtemed dearer to a Chriſtian man, then to be obedient to the will of God. And ſo the Prophetes, godly kynges, Apoſtles, and in like manner all godly men after Abraham, firſt by example haue learned the true waye of iuſtification, and afterwardes by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtaunces of the perſone, and the facte, haue bene admoniſhed of moſte weyghtye things. By this meanes the godly preacher by the example of Paule, may applye other examples, both in them ſelues and alſo in the varietie of circumſtaunces, and all ways in his application, he muſt reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber to haue a regarde to the proportion of fayth.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:17101:30"/>THat kynde of treatiſe of perſons whiche belongeth vnto demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the whole life, and alſo euery parte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life of any perſone, and that in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the places of perſones are rehearſed in the queſtions of Philip Melancton. For that order is not only naturall but alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the ſpeaker and to the hearer. But firſt of al this is to be obſerued in this kinde of treatiſe of perſones, that thoſe members eſpecially are to bee adourned, and beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, from whome theſe three aboue rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, doctrine, immitation, &amp; admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be taken. For Paule in the .xv. chapter to the Romaines, doth admoniſhe vs of this of application, when he ſayth: what ſoeuer thinges are written, are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. &amp;c. Therefore ſuche members ought to be applied to the whole body of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church whiche thing is done when wee tranſferre aright the particuler to the generall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences: as if the life of Iohn Baptiſte, were to be handled after the manner of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration: to obſerue the naturall order, wee ſhould intreate of his parentes, of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, of his natiuitie, of his education, of his vocation, of his office, of the teſtimonie
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17101:30"/>
of Chriſte, of his death and of thoſe thinges that happened both about &amp; after his death. In the member of his pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, theſe things are contained, that the continual prayers of all godly are heard at the length, that the afflicted whiche beleue do obtayne comforte at the laſte, and that God dothe allowe the marriage of prieſtes. In the member of his conception firſt the office of Aungels is to be conſidered, that they are the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of God, &amp; the miniſters of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche. Secondly, that God is myndefull of his promiſes. Thirdly, that the power or worke of God is not hindred by naturall impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is to ſaye, through barrenneſſe &amp; wante of nature. Laſt of all, becauſe Iohn as yet in his mothers wombe did acknowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Chriſte, it teacheth vs, that children are receyued of God, and that God wyll be acknowledged &amp; honoured of children. In the member of his natiuitie, thankefulnes towardes God, for his benefites receiued is commended, the mutuall office of the godly is ſhewed, that they ought to reioyce with them, on whom God poureth his bleſſing: &amp; to conclude, that the godly ought to bringe and offer their children vnto God. Againe
<pb facs="tcp:17101:31"/>
his ſtraightnes of life doth commende vnto vs, not a monkiſhe or ſolitary lyfe, but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie and obedience vnto God. After all theſe things in his office, &amp; in the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his perſone, and office, not onely his doctrine, but alſo his conſolation, his conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie in his office, his confeſſion, his croſſe, and loue of the truth, with other innumerable vertues are ſet forth vnto the godly His co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or conſolation, is in that he did ſhewe, or point out w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his finger our ſauiour Chriſtes his conſtancie in that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temning the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges of Herode and of the Phariſeis: hee caught the Goſpell without any feare: his confeſſion, in that he confeſſed him ſelf to be the voyce of a crier in the wyldernes. His croſſe, in that according to his vocation, hee did not onely wander abroade without any certayne manſion place: but alſo doubted not to ſuffer death. All theſe thinges which are ſo drawen forth of the circumſtaunces of the perſone and of his office, are firſt layd before godly miniſters of the worde, for the cauſe of doctrine, of immitation, and of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and afterwardes generally to the whole vniuerſall churche, ſo farre forth as it belongeth to the common duties of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines.

In bothe kindes there is a peculier Methode, but firſt we wil ſpeake of the former. The definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore wich the godlye preacher ſhall declare as true and immouable, muſt haue foure parts in the treatiſe, Expoſition, Reaſon, Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

&amp; concluſion. Expoſition is a ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wherby we expounde our own diffinition of any thing with manifeſt &amp; playne woordes. And there is two kindes of definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to a deuine, the one ſhort &amp; briefe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other copiouſe &amp; large, that is content with the kinde &amp; with the difference. This doth applie to the kinde, &amp; to the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, cauſes, things adioyning, or annexed proprieties, &amp; ſometimes circumſtaunces.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is the proofe of the definition. Confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is that wherby we confirme &amp; declare the reaſon, either by examples, or by any other manner of declaration.</p>
               <p>Concluſion is a briefe comprehenſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> expoſition of the reaſon, &amp; of the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

then afterwardes by litle &amp; little, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partes muſt be ioyned together by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition, &amp; the neceſſitie of the definition muſt be ſhewed: &amp; all theſe are to be added to the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner &amp; way of definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now by one or two exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, let vs make our preceptes manifeſt, &amp; let vs ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke Matrimonie in hande, for to be firſt of all defined. Matrimonie is a lawful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction of a man &amp; woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (this is the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reaſon followeth) for it is writte, wherfore let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man forſake father &amp; mother and cleaue vnto his wife (the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth) if theſe wordes were truly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we ſhould finde in them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which we did put in the definition. For firſt they teſtifie that there ought to be a coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is lawful, when it is done according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word and will of God. Furthermore where as he ſaith: they ſhalbe two in one fleſh, he would haue the copulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of one man &amp; one woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not of one huſband &amp; many wiues, neither of one wife &amp; many huſbandes, euen as the firſt wedlocke of Adam and Eue doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; declare vnto vs. (Complexion folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.) Therfore ſince God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by his own law y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> two perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſhould be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coupled together, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there ſhould bee no mo perſons in matrimonie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two. It folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
<pb facs="tcp:17101:33"/>
that Matrimonie is a lawfull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man &amp; wife: By this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of a ſimple definition may after a ſort be vnderſtanded, whiche if thou wilt applie to the lawes &amp; rules of Logicke, the firſt parte is called the queſtion: the ſecond, the reaſon, the thirde the confirmation of the reaſon, or the ſhewynge of the cauſe of the reaſon: the fourth is the concluſion, wherin by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular forme the reaſon is repeated with the queſtion. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the names of the members whiche I haue aboue rehearſed, do ſerue rather the popular &amp; vulgar trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, &amp; are more eaſy to be vnderſtanded Let vs alſo adde an other example, of a large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we wil declare more at large. And let vs take the Goſpell to bee defined. The Goſpell is a doctrine reuealed from God, wherin deliueraunce fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne, &amp; from the curſe of the lawe, &amp; the wrath of God is preached &amp; remiſſion of ſinnes, ſaluation, &amp; life euerlaſting is proclamed, to al beleuers in the ſonne of God for his ſacrifice, that the goodnes and mercie of God towardes men might be preached, and that being deliuered by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne, they might declare forth fruites worthy of the Goſpell. Thus farre goeth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17101:33"/>
the expoſition of the definition, whiche is to be reſolued by reſolution into theſe propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereof the firſt is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Goſpell is a doctrine reuealed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. The ſecond, that the Goſpell doth declare deliuerance from ſinne, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the curſe of the lawe &amp; the wrath of God. &amp;c. The third, that it proclaimeth re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes, ſaluation, &amp; life euerlaſting. The fourth, that thoſe benefites happen to them that beleue in Chriſt. The fift that the force of the Goſpell doth reſt in the ſacrifice of Chriſte. The ſixt, that out of the Goſpell God is to be preached. The ſeuenth, that man oughte to ſhewe his thankefulnes to God, in godly liuing. Theſe propoſitions muſt be in order co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed. The reaſon ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the firſt propoſition doth follow, that the Goſpell is a doctrine reuealed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. Paule doth reache manifeſtlye calling the Goſpell a ſecret miſterie, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the world. (The confirmation) by whiche wordes he teacheth openly, that the Goſpel dependeth not of mans reaſon. For if rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by any meanes were able to knowe this doctrine of his own ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, it had not bene called a ſecrete miſterie from the beginning of the worlde. (The reaſon of the ſeconde
<pb facs="tcp:17101:34"/>
propoſition (furthermore that deliueraunce from ſinne, from the curſe of the lawe, and the wrath of God is declared in the Goſpell many teſtimonies of the Prophetes and of the Apoſtles do teach vs. <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Chriſt ſhal take away ſinnes. Paule teacheth that the curſe of the lawe is aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by Chriſt his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. The father crieth from heauen that he is pleaſed by his ſonne, (the confirmation) that this is true al godly men haue experience, hauing the teſtimonie of the holy ghoſt, by whome they crie <hi>Abba</hi> father, whiche certainly they would not do, vnleſſe they did ſtedfaſtly beleue that ſinne is taken away, the curſe of the lawe aboliſhed, the wrath of God pacified, (the reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third propoſition) furthermore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; life euerlaſting, is proclaimed in the Goſpel, theſe teſtimonies beare witnes. The lorde himſelf ſaith, it is thus written, that repentaunce &amp; remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes ought to be preached in his name, the ſame preaching beginning at Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the laſt of ſaint Marke ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is promiſed to all beleuers. Likewyſe in the x. chap. to the Romains: Furthermore the lorde him ſelf doth promiſe euerlaſting life to al them
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17101:34"/>
that beleue in him. what nedeth many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. The vniuerſall ſcripture doth promiſe remiſſion of ſinnes, ſaluation &amp; euerlaſting life, to al people embracing the Goſpel. (the confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.) For it cannot be choſen, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wrath of God, the curſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, &amp; ſinne being taken away: ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, righteouſnes, &amp; life muſt needes bee obtained. But becauſe theſe things happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to al men. For <hi>Caine Iudas, Saule</hi> &amp; many others haue periſhed, &amp; at this day a great part of the world (a grief to heare) do fal into euerlaſting deſtruction. In the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fourthly is added y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites do happen to them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beleue (the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) for the lord ſaith plainly, he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beleueth in me, ſhal not periſhe, but haue euerlaſting life. (The confirmation) and leſt any man ſhould thinke that this doth depend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the condition of workes, Paule wryteth that a man is iuſtified by faith without workes, &amp; with lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth the ſame in his epiſtle both to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romains, &amp; to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians. Moreouer in the fift place is added, that the force of the Goſpel doth conſiſte in the ſacrifice of Chriſte, (the reaſon) for ſo Paule ſayth: by the redemption whiche is in Chriſte Ieſus (The comprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) for the
<pb facs="tcp:17101:35"/>
worde which Paule vſeth here is <hi>Apolytro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> that is to ſaye, redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is done when by death the price is payd. For <hi>Lytro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Such a price Chriſte payd for vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was made ſinne for vs, that we may be made the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of God. In the ſixt place, is added that God ſhould be preached for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; mercy, (the reaſon) whiche thing the multitude of Angels do ſufficiently proue, &amp; conuince, ſinging this himne to God, at our Lordes birthe, Glorie be to God on high, &amp; peace on the earth, &amp; vnto men good will. (The confirmation) for we ought to thinke that this thing done therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which do acknowledge this Chriſt, may learne by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the Angels, to preache y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; mercy of God, eſpecially when nature it ſelfe doth crye out &amp; teache vs, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thankes ought to be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for benefites, or good tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17101:35"/>
two agre that we are deliuered from ſinne, and yet fulfill the deſires of ſinne, when Paule affirmeth that the healthfull grace of God appeared to all men, that we deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vngodlines and worldly luſtes, ſhoulde liue godlye, ſoberlye and righteouſly. &amp;c. Seinge therefore that wee haue ſhewed by ſtronge reaſons, that ſinne, the curſe of the Law, and the wrath of God is taken away by the Goſpell, and that in theyr place doe ſuccede Righteouſnes, Saluation and life thorow Chriſte, which whilſt wee beleue in him, and that God would that wee ſhoulde preach his goodnes for this his benefits, &amp; in all our life time be thanckfull: that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth which before we propounded that the Goſpell is a doctrine reuealed from God, wherein is ſhewed. &amp;c. Now when our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition is after this maner handled, if there be any of a contrary opinion, they are to be confuted with the Methode of confutation, which conſiſteth of propoſition, ſublation, the oppoſite, contrarye, or propoſition, and the ſolution. The propoſition in this place is the promiſe of the ſublation, ſublation is the propoſition of our aduerſaries. The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite propoſition, is the promiſe of the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb facs="tcp:17101:36"/>
The ſolution is the confirmation op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite propoſition. But the matter ſhalbe made manifeſt, by a briefe exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. Neither am I ignoraunt that oure aduerſaryes the Papiſtes, do bable (this is the propoſition of the confutation, ſublation foloweth) that the Goſpel is the new law of not reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging, of caſting awaye of ryches of not ſwearinge &amp;c. The oppoſite propoſition foloweth, but how vaine a thing that is, may eaſely be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared (the ſolution followeth:) For that which they affirme is directlye againſt the ſacrifice of Chriſte, yea and againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Scripture, which plainly ſheweth that we obtaine the benefits of the Goſpel by fayth. What? are not Paule his woordes mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt? If righteouſnes be by the law, Chriſt dyed in vaine: this confirmation of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite propoſition is to be taken oute of the places of confirmation, that is to ſay, out of the places of Logicke, of which thing I wil ſpeake in the compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Methode of places. But what generally both in confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and confutations is to be obſerued, heare thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are ſtudious are to be admoniſhed. Firſt therefore after that wyth manifeſt &amp; plaine arguments, thou haſt confirmed the

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary propoſition in order, the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of our aduerſaryes are to be refelled, and if the matter ſuffer it ſo to be, firſte of all the firſt kind is to be taken, and afterwards we muſt come to the ſpeciall arguments: as in this preſente cauſe. Firſt wee muſt confute this that the Goſpell is a Law. Secondlye that it is not a law of forbidding of reueng, of caſti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g away of riches, of not ſwearing &amp;c. Furthermore this alſo both in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our owne opinion, &amp; in the confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the contrary part is diligently to be noted and marked, that thou preuent thoſe thinges which eyther the wiſedome of the fleſhe or els the contrary part may obiecte againſt thoſe things which thou ſayeſt and confute them. This ſeemeth to be oftenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes vſed of Paule in his wrytinges, as in this confutation layed before vs of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papiſtes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Goſpell is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new Law: the fleſh vnthanckful to God, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth weapons vnto himſelfe againſt the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of works, &amp; inferreth or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner: If the Goſpel doth deliuer vs w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out our workes, wherefore ſhould wee worke well? This obiection is to be taken away by preuention. And after this maner
<pb facs="tcp:17101:37"/>
the faythfull preacher muſt haue a reſpecte what maye be ſayd on the contrary part. But the preceptes of a large confutation, &amp; confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are to be handled afterwards.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17101:47"/>
For the Lorde died for ſinne. Secondlye, it admoniſhed vs of the ſacrifice accomplyſhed for the redemption of mankynde from the lawe of ſinne. Thirdly, the dignitie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of this ſacrifice, doth miniſter vnto godly myndes, the thought, not onely of the greatnes of the wrath of God in ſtriking his ſonne for our ſinnes, and of the vnſpeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mercie of God, receyuinge vs vnto his grace, for the ſacrifice of his ſonne: but alſo, of the loue of his ſonne, making his interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for vs, and takyng or deryuing his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wrath and diſpleaſure vppon hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:17101:48"/>IT is good ſometimes by the contrary ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, to frame a place when the termes or boundes be equall, as for example. The iuſt man liueth by fayth, ergo, hee that is not iuſte liueth not by faythe. Whereof it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that neither righteouſnes nor life, is of woorkes. For ſo Paule dothe gather it. Gal. 3. That no man is iuſtified by the lawe in the ſight of God it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, becauſe it is written the iuſt man liueth by faith. In like manner a forme by conterpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth ſome times miniſter places, as, euery one that is of God doth heare Gods worde. Here the place by conterpoſition doth gather, that he whiche heareth not Gods woorde, is not of God. Theſe be the principal rules of inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of places, whoſe fountaines are places of Logike, &amp; rules of conſequences, &amp; there may be more added to them, but I thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe are ſufficient to newe beginning prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, which if they wil vouchſafe to folow, they may both haue a ready way to ſeke out theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon places, &amp; alſo they may iudge well of thoſe places which are obſerued by others. Furthermore, hereby they may alſo iudge what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe, why diuers autors do not alwayes ſhew forth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſelfe ſame places.
<pb facs="tcp:17101:49"/>
The reaſon of the difference is as well the diuerſitie of inuention, as alſo that other places, do more contente, or pleaſe our auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours. After that the godly preacher hath founde out places, he muſt enter into a mul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titude or ſwarme of places. To this he ſhall applie a threefolde inſtrument. For firſt hee ſhall diligently conſider, whether the place founde out, may expreſſely, worde for word, be ſeene in anye place of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Secondarely, the place muſt bee examined by demonſtration to an impoſſible thing, if it be not expreſſed in the woorde of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the place muſt be concluded with ſome ſillogiſme, and by a ſillogiſticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, it muſt bee tried as it were with a toucheſtone. Let this be an example of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, to an impoſſible thing. The place to be proued is, that Chriſtians may poſſeſſe that whiche is their owne, take the oppoſite of this place. No Chriſtians may poſſeſſe that whiche is their owne. Nowe ſeke out the propoſition whiche is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, whiche with the oppoſite ſayinge, may be one of the premiſſes in the ſillogiſme as for example: all that doe geue Almes, ought to poſſeſſe their owne, of which twoo premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17101:49"/>
a moſte falſe concluſion doth follow, to witte, that no Chriſtian man ſhall giue almes. By the manifeſt falſenes of this the other of the premiſſes is to be ouerthrowne, wherfore ſince y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maior is manifeſtly true, it followeth that the Minor is falſe: front hence nowe is inferred the truthe of the place, propounded by the lawe of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Nowe let vs gather together that whiche we haue ſayde. All that ſhould geue almes, ought to poſſeſſe their owne. No Chriſtians may poſſeſſe their owne: Ergo, no Chriſtian ſhall geue almes. But the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is falſe, ergo, one of the premiſſes: not the Maior, ergo the Minor, which ſaith that: No Chriſtians maye poſſeſſe their owne. Let this be the example of a ſillogiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conuerſion. The place, ſome hearing Gods worde are not godly. The ſillogiſme. None that walke after the fleſhe are godly, ſome hearing Gods worde walke after the fleſhe: Ergo, ſome hearing Gods worde are not godly. conuerte it after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If none that walke after the fleſhe are godly, and ſome that here the worde, walke after the fleſhe: ergo, ſome that heare the worde are not godly. For al they that heare

Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are to be honoured, parentes are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, ergo ſuperiours are to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. This common place in the handling of the fifth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, is the principall, &amp; chiefly to be touched. But yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully be intreated of, it ſhalbe expedient to diduct or reduce it into other places, eyther
<pb facs="tcp:17101:51"/>
ſimple, which the very wordes them ſelues do geue: or compounde, which either do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte of them which are neceſſarely included in the wordes them ſelues, as the formes or particular ſentences, are included in their kyndes: or generall ſentences, and what thinges ſoeuer are neceſſarely ioyned with the matter: or els are taken out of them, which are annexed and ioyned to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and ſtate of the matter, as in this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple layde before vs, are included two ſimple places, one of honour, the other of ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. Theſe are to be handled a ſunder, by the ſimple kinde of teaching of thinges, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame ſorte, as I haue ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled before. Secondly, out of the diuiſion of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſentence: ſuperiours are to bee honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, many particular ſentences do ariſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the contrary diuiſion, of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte and predicate. The ſubiect may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into theſe formes that of ſuperiours, ſome are priuate, which are either natural, as parentes: or els not naturall as ſchole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſters, patrones, and houſholders: ſome are publike, as the ciuill and eccleſiaſticall magiſtrate, with their differences. Further more the predicate (to be honoured) may be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17101:51"/>
deuided into partes of honour, for he which honoureth an other, doth reuerence him, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, and is thankefull vnto him. So there are three partes, or differences of the predicate. From hence as out of a groue, we may gather particular ſentences. As we muſt reuerence our parentes, we muſt obey our parentes, we muſt bee thankefull to our parentes, wee muſt reuerence oure maiſters, wee muſt obey our maiſters, wee muſt bee thankefull to oure maiſters, wee muſt reuerence patrones, wee muſt obaye patrones, wee muſt bee thankefull to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones. After the ſame manner particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſentences are to bee framed, out of the reſt whiche I haue declared, from whence may enſue a moſte great plentie of needeful queſtions. Ouer and beſides this, places oftentymes, are proffitably taken out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche conſiſt of the ſtate and condition, as: if parentes, ſcholemaiſters, patrones, are frowarde, or ouerthwarte, harde, or cruell, whether then wee ſhould ſhewe them any reuerence, obedience, or kyndnes? and to what ende? and ſo out of other conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, queſtions, are multiplied. But this laſte kynde of queſtions, whiche doth growe out
<pb facs="tcp:17101:52"/>
of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition may be handled very fitly by a figure called occupation. Beholde if thou wilt vnfolde theſe particular ſentences, by reſolution and wilt handle them by diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and confirme, and garniſhe them with the methode of confirmation: not one ſermone, but ſoe manye as there are particular ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, may be made, and framed. I confeſſe that all common places, doe not ſhewe ſo great plentie of particular ſentences, not withſtanding there is none ſo barraine, but at the leaſt, it may miniſter ſome ſentences, which ye may frame out of a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place, by the ſame reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is declared, which thinge that thou maieſt doe cunninglye, it woulde muche profite thee if thou haddeſt ſailfull knowledge in the doctrine of predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cables, predicamentes, and propoſitions.</p>

               <p>THere is a three fould kinde of proofes in Diuinity. The firſt and moſt ſafeſt kind, is when proofe is brought out of the euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and cleare propoſitions of the Scripture. As for example, Parentes are to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe the 5. Comaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and plainly commaundeth: Honour thy father and thy mother. In like c<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes is of fayth &amp; not of works, becauſe the word of the Lord doth ſo pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. We hould that a man is iuſtifyed by fayth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out workes. The ſecond kind is reaſoning as oftentimes as it is not pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced by plaine woordes, but is gathered by a ſtronge and vnmouable conſequence. And this kinde is double, ſtreight and indirect. The ſtreight is when that which is to bee proued, is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered plainly in the firſt concluſion, which kinde is borowed from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of the kinde, of the forme, of the definition, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſes, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſtinates, &amp; of things, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning. As if this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were aſked, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther ſcholemaſters are to be honoured? out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinde, or general, thou maieſt conclude well that all ſuperiours are to be honored, ergo ſcholemaſters alſo, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> indirect kind
<pb facs="tcp:17101:53"/>
concludeth not ſimplie, that whiche is ſet downe to be proued: but doth gather an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience out of the oppoſite or contrary, wherwith he ouerthroweth the Antecedent which being ouerthrowen the truthe of the oppoſite immediatly floweth: as if ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours are not to be honoured, neither pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are to be honoured, but this is falſe, ergo, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> alſo. Therefore it followeth ſuperiours are to be honoured. The third kinde is, of leſſe reputation, when we laboure in the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies, &amp; examples of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ſeme to haue floriſhed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, which kinde is diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, if it be depriued of the former proofes. Let vs propounde an other exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. And let the queſtion bee whether Chriſte bee God. This is firſt proued by a ſaying, or by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt kind of proofe. For thus is it ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt in the firſt of Iohn, chap. 5. he is true God &amp; life euerlaſting. Secondlye by reaſoning, Chriſte hath done the workes pertaining to God of his own proper power, &amp; the honour of God is attributed to Chriſte, ergo, he is God by the indirect waye: If Chriſte were only a creature, euery one only were accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that would put their confidence in him: but nowe Gods woorde pronounceth them
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17101:53"/>
bleſſed which put their truſt in him, ergo, he is no creature, but true God. Thirdly, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of the church, as the crede of Atha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naſius, and the voyce of all the people, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their conſent, do teſtifie Chriſte to bee God. Furthermore this our diſtinction of proofes wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth neither reaſon, nor exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. The reaſon is this, whatſoeuer is proued, or diſproued in ſacred thinges, it is needefull y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſame be done, either by teſtimony of the ſcripture, or of the churche. If it be done by the ſcripture, it ſhalbe either by the expreſſe woordes from whence the firſte kinde doth growe, or els intricatly, or obſcurely, &amp; that either in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> generall, or in the particular ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, from whence the ſecond kind of proofe is taken. But if any thing be proued by the teſtimonie of the churche, it ſhalbe the third kind of proofe. Hereof truly we haue an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Paule, who in his wryting as it is wel knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath vſed this threefolde kinde of proofe. That righteouſnes is of faith: by ſaying or wordes he proueth it when as hee ſaith: The iuſt man liueth by faith, by reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thus. If righteouſnes be of woorkes, Chriſte died in vayne. From hence now that followeth whiche he propounded, that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
<pb facs="tcp:17101:54"/>
is of fayth. By example: <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> beleeued God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſnes. Alſo wee beleeue in Chriſte, that wee may be iuſtifyed by fayth. If theſe kindes be delated or ſpoken of at large, there wil aryſe great plenty of proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes, but yet a meane is to be kept, leſt plenty come out of ſeaſon, &amp; ſo breede lothſomnes.</p>

               <head>¶ Of the Expolition or dilating of Argumentes.</head>
               <p>EXpolition or dilatinge, is by the which an Argument propounded is confirmed and beutifyed. But a copious Expolition conſiſteth of a propoſition, of a reaſon, of a ſhewing, the cauſe of the reaſon of Exorna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of Concluſion. The Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that, which ſetteth before oure eyes ſome Chapter of an Argument, as though it were the propoſition of a confirmation.
<pb facs="tcp:17101:55"/>
The reaſon alloweth the propoſition, and it ought to be ſuch a one, as maye be the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of a ſillogiſme. <hi>Aetiologia,</hi> doth ſhew the cauſe of the reaſon, and it is meete, that it be ſuch a one as maye eyther be the maior of a ſillogiſme, or els the proufe therof: So that a whole ſillogiſme is made of a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, of a reaſon, and of the cauſe of the Reaſon. After the cauſe of the reaſon, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornation ſhall followe, which is to be boro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed of ſentences, comparates, contraryes, ſimilitudes, examples. The laſte ſhalbe the concluſion, which gathereth together the ſumme of the former, and concludeth the principall propoſition. Theſe are the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes of an expolition, neyther doth that which I haue ſayd, ſtriue againſt the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or iudgemente of them which haue nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred ſeuen parts of an expolicion. For there is not onelye one kinde of expolition, but I haue choſen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onely which I thought to be moſt meete for preachers, that are but new beginners. But to the ende the preceptes of an expolition may be vnderſtanded. I wil put downe one example. I haue before propounded this common place: No man of his owne power or ſtrengthe is able to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17101:55"/>
fulfill the lawes of God. Furthermore to this place I haue added foure Chapters of proofe, by a heaping of arguments. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt was, that the experience of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did proue that to be true. Let this Chapter be the propoſition of an expolition after this maner. The experience of all men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth this, that no man is able to fulfill the Lawe of God. (the reaſon) For all men doe eaſelye perceiue in themſelues, howe farre they are from the perfecte and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall obedience of the Lawe of God. (The reaſon of the cauſe) For they ſee that the Lawe of God is holye, and a rule of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect life: and that they themſelues are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether wicked by nature, and alſo feeble, and weake (the exornation from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.) So that is true whereof the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that all oure righteouſnes is as the cloth of a menſtruous woman: which ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence how cold it conſiſt, if the experience of any wiſe man had proued the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. (the exornation from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſons) For euen as a tree whoſe roote is rotten, and infected with a poyſoned ſappe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer bring forth but poyſoned fruite: ſo man whoſe harte is infected with the poyſon of ſinne, cannot
<pb facs="tcp:17101:56"/>
ſhewe a pure and perfecte obedience to the law of God. (The exornation from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples what: did not holye <hi>Abell</hi> confeſſe this in his Sacrifice: trulye it is euen ſo: For God had neuer allowed the Sacrifice of <hi>Abell,</hi> vnleſſe that holy man had knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt to be him which was promiſed, that ſhould iuſtifye all beleeuers, &amp; vnderſtoode his owne ſinne: whereby hee knew himſelfe to be hindred, that he coulde not fulfill the lawe of God. For if hee had thoughte him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe able to fulfill the lawe, he could neuer haue ſacrificed a right, that is to ſaye haue declared in his ſacrifice, that the promiſed ſeede, ſhoulde be the fulfiller of the Lawe. Hereunto <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo as a moſte ſufficiente witnes may be added, who crying vnto the Lorde, confeſſeth openly, that no man is iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of God. For hee complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all haue erred, and are made vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, &amp;c. The concluſion) Since therfore wee haue Dauid as a witnes: ſince wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the poyſon of ſinne, ſince we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould the purity of the Law, and our owne vncleannes, who I praye you, (vnleſſe hee weare a mad man woulde denye this: that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17101:56"/>
hee telleth his owne weakenes, and imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillitye in rendringe obedience to the Lawe of GOD. In this example after a ſorte yee maye ſee the vſe of expolition: whiche if I had determined to haue handled at large, euerye parte beinge dilated and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed, a whole Oration euen oute of the firſt Chapter of the proofe, woulde plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye haue proceeded.

Wherfore they ſhall take a moſte profitable woorke in hande, if they will buſilye practiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the handlinge of an Expolition.

For ſuch oughte the matter of Digreſſion to bee, that of his owne accorde, it maye ſeeme to flowe oute of the Doctrine, and not to bee fetched anye where els. For excepte the force, and nature of Learninge, do offer the matter of digreſſion, it can make nothinge to edification at all. This precepte is therefore more dilligentlye to be obſerued, becauſe often tymes they that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exerciſed offende againſte it, not withoute great iniurye of the woord of GOD, and hurte of the hearers. In the fourth place I haue put downe Tyme, which of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye requireth a Digreſſion, for when the hearers doe eyther abhorie the Doctrine, eyther are ſomewhat more ſlouthfull, or els be faint harted, then are they to be chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, prouoked, and comforted.

Fourthlye, al thinges are ſo to be diſpoſed, that the paſſage maye be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſye into the place followinge, if manye are to be expounded: as for example, the place which I proponed aboue beinge declared: That no man of his owne power is able to fulfil the Lawe of God, this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion were not vnprofitable (the repetition of the place) whoe nowe after this will thincke himſelfe to be able of his owne power to fulfill the lawe of God (the enumeration

of argumentes) when as not onelye expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and nature do deny it, the ſcripture in euery corner by manifeſt teſtimonies doth confute it: but alſo the ſacrifice of the ſame doth teache a farre contrary thing (the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) wherefore this place teacheth vs all to acknowledge our weakenes and ſynne, confuteth the Iuſticiaries, whiche do boaſte of the righteouſnes of the lawe, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth vs all, that confeſſing our ſinnes &amp; weakenes, wee ſhoulde flie vnto Chriſte, (the tranſition) whome the Goſpell offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto vs, whereof wee muſt ſpeake pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlye.</p>

The aucthour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Epiſtle to the Hebrues the 12. Chapter ſayth that we are baſtards and not ſonnes, if wee be without diſcipline and correction, ſuche like places are moſte fitte, wherewith the minde of the guiltye perſon now beinge penitent, maye be lifted vp, that nowe he woulde ſuffer any kinde of puniſhmente as one readye to obeye Gode let the examples be <hi>Manaſſes, Dauid,</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Kinge <hi>Vſias,</hi> the people ledde into Captiuitye, and manye others, whiche were puniſhed for certaine ſinnes, and after throughe repentaunce, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned home againe. The example of the theefe in compariſon of others is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, who hath ſet foorth a notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of patience and fayth. Hee did not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore compte himſelfe an abiecte becauſe hee ſuffered ſoe ſhamefull a death for his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, but pacientlye ſuſtayned the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued puniſhmente, by Faythe repoſed in <hi>CHRISTE.</hi> After ſuche like teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies &amp; examples, wherwith the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God are to be made knowne, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring the manners of men in oure age, with the maners of the people in the olde time: For God is alwayes like to himſelfe: (whether
<pb facs="tcp:17101:69"/>
thou haſt reſpect to puniſhment or mercy) the common places before mencioned maye be added. But if that which greeueth him doe come through an others mans faulte, that order in applyinge of comforte is to be folowed, which in a common comfort I am aboute to declare, whereto we muſt ſpeake at this time. That common comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore maye be rightlye framed, three thinges are to be obſerued. Firſt from whence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamitie procedeth. Secondly which be cauſes thereof. Thirdly the applyinge of the Comforte according to the difference of the calamity and of the cauſes. The cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is eyther ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, or els brought in by the ennemyes of our Common weale. If the calamitye be of God, as the plague, wante of foode and vittaile, droughte and tempeſtes, the cauſes are not to be ſoughte for without vs, but in our owne houſes, and within our ſelues, for the ſinnes of perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler men are the cauſes of common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and oftentimes for one mans fault the whole common wealth is plagued: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Acham, Dauid, Oedipus,</hi> and manye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are witneſſes, who by their owne wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes haue brought in a common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17101:69"/>
Here it is no harde matter to applye a comfort, if wee will followe the examples of the holy Prophetes: for the examples of them do teache vs, what is to be done: for they are wont openly to rebuke wickednes, and that after three ſortes or kindes of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, to witte: The forſaking of God, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſye, iniurye done to the neighboure and ſuch like, as moſt chiefelye ſeeme to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounde amonge the people. Examples are extant heare and there in the wrytinges of the Prophetes. Againe they are wonte to call publickly together al the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to repentaunce, faſtinge and prayer, Certaine notable examples of theſe two thinges are of late yeares ſet forthe, at the commaundement of our moſt noble King, by the myniſters of oure Churches, not withoute greate profite and mittigation, of deſerued puniſhmentes. Laſt of al the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes were wont to admoniſhe them, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they perceyued to bee defiled with wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, more then others, leauing an example to oure myniſters of the worde, that they ſhould admoniſhe, rebuke and correct them priuatelye) whom they perceiue, by theyr idolatry, vſurie, adulterye, tirannye, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
<pb facs="tcp:17101:70"/>
couetouſnes &amp;c. to bring in a plague to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. <hi>Tyreſias,</hi> although he were an Ethenicke prieſt did call <hi>Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> the tyraunte, (for whoſe miſcheuous deede, the <hi>Theban</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the peſtilence,) to painefull pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce. And after this maner <hi>Eſaye</hi> and <hi>Ieremye</hi> haue corrected and reprehended the kinges of their time, and haue aſcribed common calamities vnto theym. And the miniſters of the word ought to knowe that this is not the leaſt part of their function &amp; duty, which if they neglect eyther for feare or ſluggiſhnes, they ſhall ſuffer greeuous puniſhments of God, as in the threatnings of <hi>Ezechiell</hi> is declared, and els where.</p>
               <p>But if either priuate or publicke calamitye doe come from men, it is either for Iuſtice or not. If for Iuſtice, wee muſte then take the comforte from the common condition of the ſonnes of God in this worlde, &amp; declare of how great honour God reputeth vs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee hath marked vs with a peculier proper marke of his warfare and exerciſe. Wherefore the Apoſtles being ſcourged do reioyce for that they are counted worthye to ſuffer reproche for the name of Chriſte:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17101:70"/>
For this kinde of croſſe is moſt proper vnto the faithfull, wherewith Chriſte wilbe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed in vs, euen as S. Peter teacheth in the fourth Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>But if not for Iuſtice the common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be broupht vs from men, then the cauſes are to be ſoughte oute in our ſelues, and as before I haue ſaid wheras I haue ſpoken of the Croſſe or affliction ſent from God: the comforte is to be applied. Out of theſe I thincke it is manifeſt by what waye &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes both priuate and publicke comforts are to be applyed.</p>

               <head>¶ Of the chidinge Sermon.</head>
               <p>THe Chidinge Sermon is that in the which the preacher chydeth eyther the loytring or the offendinge, or the ſtubburne and diſobediente hearer. The ende of this oughte to be the correction and the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him which is rebuked. Here theſe places are chiefely to be conſidered. The firſt, the filthines of the thinge committed. The ſeconde, thinges adioyninge or apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning: as are an euill, conſcience, the peril
<pb facs="tcp:17101:71"/>
of reiection, or to be a caſte a waye, and the feare of God, his iudgement hanging ouer our head, and of the preſent and euerlaſting paynes. The third a conference together of the dignity of the perſon and of the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the thing. The fourth, examples. The fifthe the knitting or ioyning together of the perſon, as Chriſte our head and king, the Church which is the ſpiritual country, our body which is dedicated to God, that it may be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of God, hereunto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale the houſe the familye &amp;c. maye be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. When I recken theſe places, I doe not thincke that all are to be applyed in euery chiding, but now theſe, ſometimes the other, euen as the wiſe Preacher ſhall ſee to be expedient. Let the example be taken out of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians &amp; the 6 Chapter, where S. Paule rebuketh fornicatours. The Methode of a treatiſe is not vnlike to the treatiſe of an exhortation. Wherfore I thincke it not needeful to adde any example: eſpecially, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the places are ſo plaine, and it is knowen that all thinges are to be proued, allowed, and garniſhed by the Methode of confirmation. But here I thoughte it needefull to adde two<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinges.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17101:71"/>
The firſt that the minde of him which is to be chidden, muſt bee mollifyed to heare chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges paciently, which thing may very fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye be done, if the myniſter declare his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye towardes the giltye perſon, and ſhewe the common neceſſity layed vpon him to do the ſame, leaſt the chiding ſhoulde ſeeme to proceede of ſome noughtye affection: So S. Paule did before hand mollify the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the Corinthians, before hee vſed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and bitter chidings. The ſecond that conditions of repentaunce may be mingled, leaſt any being diſcouraged, with ſomwhat more rougher chidinges, ſhoulde fall into deſperation or wilfullye kill himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the things good audience which I haue thoughte needefull to be declared, to newe Preachers, and I truſte (vnleſſe my opinion do foulye beguile mee) that yonge men ſhal not be a little holpen by declaring this Methode. For all the preceptes which are recited by mee are taken oute of the fountaines of Logitians and Rethoricia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and are applied to the vſe of the Preacher profitable both to the expoſition of the holy writers, and alſo to the makinge of ſacred Sermons, wyth the which if yonge men
<pb facs="tcp:17101:72"/>
will ſuffer themſelues to be ruled, I doubts not to promiſe them an eaſier proceeding in deuine ſtudies, and makinge of Sermons. But becauſe it is not ſufficiente to haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented fitly, or to haue ordered and diſpoſed thoſe things which we are about to ſpeake of wiſelye, vnleſſe bleſſed Memorie be alſo preſent. I will adde a few thinges of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merie in ſteede of a concluſion to this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode: and that not after the maner of the olde fathers <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <p>LEt vs appointe two maner of wayes of helpinge the memorie, whereof the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is more artificiall, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> latter more rude, and ruſticall: that which is more artificiall doth conſiſt of two thinges, that is to witte, of order and nomber, for by theſe it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17101:72"/>
that artes are both taught and learned. For as order placeth euerye thinge in his proper place, &amp; conſidereth the beginnings, proceedinges, and markes or ends: ſo doth nomber meaſure thinges together, &amp; their partes and porcions. Becauſe therefore the Methode which I haue taught, doth ſhewe an order of things and as it were nombreth the partes, the beſt way of learning by hart is diligently to conſider the ſame order in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde, for it cannot bee, that he which hath conningly framed an order of thinges, and hath obſerued the leaſt pointes of thinges &amp; as it were nombered them, but that he may eaſelye kepe the ſame in minde, and require the ſame againe of it, when and as often as he ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake: whereby it maye ſeeme a fooliſhe thinge to preſcribe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other way of learning by hart, eſpeciall to thoſe men which are taughte and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the art of eloquent ſpeakinge.

<pb facs="tcp:17101:73"/>
learning by hart which I haue ſaid, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte of order and nomber, into foure mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or preceptes. The firſt is that he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the matter perfectly, and minding to preach, do kepe in minde a certaine briefe comprehenſion of the whole matter.

The third mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is, that he make deuiſions of the places, that are to be handled, which is needefull to be comprehended in a certaine nomber, which if it may be done by any Verſe, fit for the ſame, it ſhall not be vnprofitable: as if the vſe of the lawe weare to be expounded.

The fourth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber is, that in certaine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces digreſſions into threateninges, conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and exhortations be placed, leaſte in making digreſſion to an other matter, the memory be hindered, and the preacher with drawen from the matter propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, which commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly is wonte to happen, to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which do not obſerue this precept. Nowe when as according to theſe fower preceptes, hee that
<pb facs="tcp:17101:74"/>
will preache hath diſpoſed his Oration, and as it were reconed it. Hee muſt ſettle him ſelfe to learne it accordinge to the order of his diſpoſition. And firſte of all, hee muſt commit to memorie the briefe, and ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie comprehenſion, for that is firſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited. Secondly, he muſt learne the places, or the chapters a ſonder. And thirdlye the treatiſe or handlindling of the places with their diuiſions and the parcels of them. I doubte not but this waye of learninge by harte, is the beſt of all, whiche all learned men without doubt do followe. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the latter reaſon whiche I ſayde is more rude and ruſtical, is profitable to men vnlearned, which haue not taſted of the arte of Rhethoricke. And this whether it be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with notes of nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, or with letters, it is all one, and it may be done in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Firſt, thoſe thinges whiche a preacher ignoraunt of artes will learne by harte, hee ſhall deuide with notes of number, or with euery letter. Afterwarde in repeting, hee ſhall ſee what he hath ſette downe at euery note or letter. Laſt of all, he ſhall learne by harte according to the diſtinctions whiche he hath made, and ſhall demaunde agayne
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17101:74"/>
of euery note or letter, as a thing commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their cuſtody that whiche before hee had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto them. It will not a litle profite him if firſte hee wryte out his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone, and afterwarde according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript rules do diuide, and learne it by harte.
