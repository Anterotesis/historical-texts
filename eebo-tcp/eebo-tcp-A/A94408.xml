            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving obtained favour from the Lord in this day of Apoſtacy to be faithfull to him in the promotion of righteouſneſſe, ſo long contended for, which for ſometime paſt, to the grief of our hearts, hath been ſlighted and publickly denied, by thoſe, who formerly had ſolemnely (before the Lord and his people) engaged for it; and now after our ſo long wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Lord, he hath been pleaſed to give us ſome grounds of hope, that we ſhall live to ſee the reviving of the good <hi>Old Cauſe,</hi> by the taſte you have given us of your willingneſs to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for it, in ſome of your late expreſſions. The underſtanding of which (together with what we have obſerved by tracing the foot ſteps of providence in your late tranſactions) giveth us ground to believe that you are returning in good earneſt; the thoughts, of which, incourageth us to preſent unto you, vvhat the Lord hath powerfully put upon our ſpirits, as the reſult of our ſeveral meetings, wherein we doubt not but we have met with God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That you conſider when and where you turned aſide from the way in which God was pleaſed eminently to own you; and alſo whether you have not found a want of that preſence of the Lord going along with your Counſels and Affairs, which in former times you were guided by, when that you appeared ſingly for God and your Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly, that you would take a re-view of that Declaration of that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Parliament, publiſhed in the year</hi> 1648, March 17. <hi>wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the grounds of a</hi> Free State; <hi>and that the ſame Parliament (who changed the Government from Kingly to a Commonwealth) may aſſemble themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for the exerciſe of the</hi> Supreme <hi>Trust committed to them, in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of which on</hi> April 20. 1653. <hi>they were interrupted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly, that you would conſider who they were that from time to time have obſtructed the faithful proceedings of thoſe that are among you, whoſe hearts God hath touched with a ſenſe of the great neglect of their Duty to God and their Country; and be admoniſhed forthwith to diſmiſs them, out of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Armies for time to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Lastly, that you would conſider who they are that have been ejected the Army, or otherwiſe forced to forſake it, for their Faithfulneſs to the Cauſe of God and his People, in bearing their teſtimony against Tyranny and Oppreſsion, and with all ſpeed call them to their Places, and admit them to your Councils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the doing of theſe things you vvill ſtrengthen our hopes, that you are in reality and truth for God and his people, vvho vvill be thereby engaged to encourage and ſtand by you vvith their lives and Eſtates; otherwiſe our Fears will be enlarged, that you are but daubing with untempered mortar; and you may aſſuredly expect, that then the Lord will depart from you, and all the Faithful decline you.</p>
