            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

him) the other with the bad man, but the good
King, <hi>Richard</hi> the third, for so the Lawes he made
in his short Gouernment doe Illustrate him; But
lastly in the most Eminent part of the <hi>Chariot</hi> I
place the wise and politique <hi>Henry</hi> the Seauenth,
houlding the Charter by which the Company was
Improued from the Title of Linin-Armorers into

of Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi> The Chayres of these

            <p>To second this, follow the two beast, the Lyon

on the Camell rides a <hi>Turke,</hi> such as vse to

            <p>The fourth eminent Pagiant, I call the <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Charity</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> this fashioned like
a beautifull Garden with all kind of flowers, at the
soure Corners, foure artificiall Bird Cages, with
variety of Birds in them: this for the beauty of the
Flowers, and melody of the Birds, to represent a
Spring in Winter: in the middest of the Garden,
vnder one Elme-tree, sits the famous and worthy
Patriot Sir <hi>Thomas White;</hi> who had a dreame that
hee should build a Colledge where two bodies
of an Elme sprang from one roote, and beeing
inspired to it by God, first rod to <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
to see if he could find any such, Failing of it there,
<pb facs="tcp:11823:9"/>
went to Oxford and surueighing all the grounds, in
and neere the Vniuersity, at last in Gloster-Hall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garden,
he found one that somewhat resembled it,
vpon which he resolued to endow it with larger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenew,
and to increase the foundation, hauing
set men at worke vpon it, and riding one day out at
the North-Gate at Oxford, he spied on his right
hand the selfe same Elme had bin figurd him in his
dreame, wherevpon he giues o're his former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
of so amply inlarging Gloster-Hall (yet
not without a large exhibition to it) purchases the
ground where the Elme stood: and in the same
place built the Colledge of <hi>Saint Iohn Baptist,</hi> and
to this day the Elme growes in the Garden, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
preserued; as beeing vnder God a motiue to
their worthy foundation.</p>
            <p>This I haue heard Fellowes of the House of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued

affirme to haue bin deliuered from man to man,

White</hi> inuiting the Abbot of <hi>Osnye</hi> to dinner in the
aforesayd Hall, In the Abbots presence, and the
hearing of diuers other graue persons affirm'd by
Gods Inspiration in the former receited maner, he
built and endowed the Colledge.</p>

               <l>Cald to a higher Court of Parliament,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11823:11"/>In his full strength of Youth and height of blood,</l>
               <l>And which Crownd all, when he was truely good:</l>
               <l>On Vertue, and on Worth he still was throwing</l>
               <l>Most bounteous shewers, where er'e he found them growing,</l>
               <l>He neuer did disguise his wayes by Art</l>
               <l>But shooted his intents vnto his hart,</l>
               <l>And lou'd to do good, more for goodnesse sake,</l>
               <l>Then any retribution man could make.</l>
               <l>Such was this Prince, such are the noble hearts;</l>
               <l>who when they dye, yet dye not in all parts:</l>

               <l>Haue not forgot him who ought ner'e to dye:</l>
               <l>Yet, wherfore should our sorrow giue him dead,</l>
               <l>When a new <hi>Phnaeix</hi> springs vp in his stead:</l>
               <l>That as he seconds him in euery grace,</l>

               <l>Good rest my Lord, <hi>Integrity</hi> that keeps</l>
