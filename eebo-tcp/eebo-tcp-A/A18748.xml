            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But what I see and the world reports
<pb facs="tcp:5299:3"/>
of your Lordship, makes me somwhat hardie to offer a present, yet simplenes of spirit and want of profound learning, hath so muffled my muses, that they dare not speake, nor I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to write, neuertheles thinking on your twenty fold honorable father (my great good Lord) matchlesse in our world, that caried in his breast the feare of God, and wan with his life the loue of men (so noble was his minde) I stood nothing discouraged, bicause a sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier like noble sonne of his is left aliue, to follow the steps of so stately a father, and to shine aboue and beyond the course of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands in this time, or is likely to come after this age. To treate of particulars in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, I should presume too far, and vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly come too short of matter fit for this cause. Wherefore I am to leaue those deepe considerations, and drop into the shallownes of mine owne studies, that brings foorth a booke of the coldnes of charitie, bicause a great noble man, told me this last wet som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, The weather was too colde for Poets. On which fauorable words, I bethought me
<pb facs="tcp:5299:3"/>
that charitie in court and all the world ouer, was become so cold, that neither hot sommer, feruent fire, nor heate of sunne could make warme againe, in that comfortable sort as our forefathers haue felt it: so my good L. follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that onely theame of cold weather (being apt to take any theam) to write on, in as sweete a phrase and termes as I may deuise (putting in the praise of Poets withall) I smoothly passe ouer (without bitter speeches) the corruption of this world, and disguised maners of men, riding by the new fanglenes of a multitude, and not dashing any ones infirmitie, with blot of disgrace, or blemish of credit, hoping the best sort shall stand pleased with, howsoeuer the woorst (happily may be touched) do of meere malice, wrest awry the honest meaning of a plaine writer. For the dutifull regard, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the purchasing of your L. fauor hath so sifted euery word and sentence, that no one verse or line shall bee offensiue to a sounde iudgement and good construction. And for that now (by reason of great age) my wits and inuentions are almost wearied with writing
<pb facs="tcp:5299:4"/>
of bookes (this being one of the last) I tooke this taske in hand, at large to dilate somewhat of Charitie, which would to God I had as great power to reuiue, as the world hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to remember. Thus ouer-bold to trouble your L. so long with the reading of so simple an Epistle, I proceed vnder your honorable supportation, to my purposed matter, wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your L. euerlasting fame, credit, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, most humbly at commandement,</p>
