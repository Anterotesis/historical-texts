            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>w the ſtreame, I could not chuſe but aſcend to a time foregoing mine, as well to begin where the former Hiſtorian of that Countries Gouernment left; as becauſe, that from that time, the later and ſucceeding troubles had their likely beginning; purpoſing to haue proceeded thence, to the end of the laſt Warres of <hi>Ireland:</hi> In moſt part of which, I had ſpent many of my endeuours, thether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued from the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> where from a childe, I had receiued breeding, then liuing in thoſe Warres, when this worthy Gouernour Sir <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> ruled in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where, if ſuch had beeue Gods pleaſure, we may gueſſe, it had beene happy that he had gouerned much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as well for the good of that Kingdome: as for the honour and contentment of our late moſt famous and euer renowned Queene, to whom the enſuing troubles (through the faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Gouernment of his Succeſſours, brought diſhonour and griefe. Firſt, by the loſſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy men (the flower of our Nation) with an infinite number of guiltleſſe ſoules torne out of this world by miſery and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in thoſe Warres, the expence of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous maſſe of Treaſure, with other prouiſion, enough to haue ſhaken the Walls of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Monarchy in <hi>Europe,</hi> if all theſe had beene
<pb facs="tcp:16801:4"/>
ſo imployed, which was not vnlikely, if Sir <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> had beene returned into <hi>Ireland,</hi> as vpon the beginning of the Warres the Queene determined. Then by being ſo long reſiſted by ſuch baſe Rebels concluding her Raigne, (that had flouriſhed with ſo many famous Acts againſt the capitall Enemie of her, and her neighbours, by which they at this day, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of miſery, flouriſh againe in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) with a ſtrong Warre againſt ſo petty Traytours: Whereon, ſince time will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the paſſage it ſelfe, I ſhall neede to inſiſt no longer: This purpoſe of the Queenes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne Sir <hi>Iohn Perrot,</hi> was preuented by the two ſinnes of <hi>Couetouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the then Gouernour there, and a perſon here tranſcendent both in power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the one, to maintaine his profit (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſome powerfull friend of his had too much relation:) the other not brooking Sir <hi>Iohn Perrots</hi> high, and (indeede) too chollerick ſpirit and condition, being fearefull of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement, ioyned with the other. So groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a combination, builded vp by the helpe of two other inſtruments of that State, the one in his owne Nature euill, the other contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for his particular ends. Thus an Enemie Armed, it was no difficult thing, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Traytor ſhould bee encouraged in hope of pardon, and ſome other mercenarie perſons to accuſe an Innocent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16801:5"/>
To this forged accuſation, That great and iuſt Prince (incenſed to diſpleaſure by ſuch an one as was neere in fauour, who pretended her ſafety, as the colour of his intended ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and that diſpleaſure exaſperated by ſome part of the accuſation, which to her was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall) was vrged to giue way, euen againſt her heart to his proſecution, as appeared by her anſwer to the newes of his condemnation: for ſhe caſting into the ballance of her iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his former weighty Seruices, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous endeuours, and weighing them with thoſe baſe perſons his Accuſers, and their light proofes produced againſt him, ſaid thus in the hearing of men of good account, and ſome neere to me in bloud and acquaintance. Is he found guilty? Then, in my conſcience, they haue found an Innocent guilty.</p>
            <p>And had ſhe reſtored his Eſtate to his iſſue, as ſhee reſpited his. Execution, being hardly drawne to giue way to his ſentence. The fault had wholly layne vpon the falſe accuſations, and ſentence, thereupon procured, by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his Proſecutors, and Periurie of his Accuſers: But ſo long a Reigne as hers, hath ſeldome eſcaped being ſpotted with greater blots, then this omiſſion, which, if God had ſpared her a little longer life, ſhe had (as I haue beene credibly tolde) repaired by a Reall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his Eſtate, to ſuch as he had diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it in his life time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16801:5"/>
Thus much I am moued the more to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by writing his Gouernement, which gaue me occaſion to looke further then others haue done into the courſe and cauſe of his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>As I was proceeding in my intended diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I gayned notice, that this Story ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Sir <hi>Iohn Perrots</hi> time, was already vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pen of a more able hand, one that had taken much paines in that Subiect, (onely hauing omittted Sir <hi>Iohn Perrots</hi> time for ſome particular reaſons) which muſt needes ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh my worke, becauſe not ſo ſubſtantiall. I abruptly therefore brake off, with ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe as to him belonged, who was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of my vndertaking. And if this, thus much, come in Print, I pray you know it, to be his will onely. But if this weake labour be not miſliked, I will proceede further, as time ſhall ſpare me leaſure.</p>

For ſo great a maſſe of Treaſure haue you already imployed to that end, that no Prince in the world, (except your Maieſtie, who hath bin moued with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of your people, and feare of God only)
<pb facs="tcp:16801:7"/>
would in reaſon or good pollicy, giue ſo much for the purchaſe of ſuch an other Land, to bee enioyed in peaceable poſſeſſion. And yet, notwithſtanding all that, your Maieſties care and coſt that way, hath not hitherto yeelded that fruit that your Maieſty doth deſire. For the State of that Country hath growne dayly from worſe to worſe, and from dangerous t<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> moſt dangerous.</p>
            <p>Many men doe alledge cauſes hereof: But next to the want of the true knowledge of God, and of the due courſe of Iuſtice, to giue euery man a peaceable propriety of that which is his owne; I take (vnder correction) that the ſmoothing vp of all former Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by Pardons and Protections, hath beene the miſery and cauſe of moſt of this miſchiefe. For if it were not too bitter a rehearſall, it were no hard matter to make it appeare, how one Rebellion during your Maieſties Raigne, hath hatcht another; and how againe of all them, this laſt more dangerous then they all, hath taken this ſtrong rooting with forraigne combination.</p>
            <p>Leauing this third cauſe a while, I craue pardon to ſay a little of the two former prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cauſes, want of Religion, and Lawe. It is a lamentable thing to behold, how gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in that Realme, they are ſo farre, of not onely, from true, but alſo (in effect) from any knowledge at all of God; tha<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Saint <hi>Patrick</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:16801:8"/>
is more familiar, and of better credite with them, then Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour. How can a people ſo eſtranged from God, and their duty to him, haue any grace to know their lawfull Prince, and their duty to her? The like is to be ſaid of the Lawes, from which they flye, as from the yoke of bondage, and not deſire to be tyed by it, as by the linke of humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as they ought to be; The reformation muſt therefore begin at God. His will and word muſt be duly planted, and Idolatry extirped. Next, Law muſt be eſtabliſhed, and lycentious cuſtomes abrogated.</p>
            <p>The meanes to effect both, is now moſt fitly offered by the Rebellion now a foore: So as a man that ſhould giue his opinion for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of <hi>Ire<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and,</hi> might conclude all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with this one ſhort reſolution: Correct this Rebellion throughly, and reforme <hi>Ireland</hi> preſently. I muſt therefore craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to ſay a little more concerning this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, before I meddle with other particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of reformation. There be three ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to moue your Maieſty to correct this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion with all earneſt ſeuerity, not allowing pardon or protection to be giuen to any man, but vpon ſpeciall and vrgent great cauſes. The firſt reaſon is, The charge that God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your Maieſty ouer that people, to ſee the good maintained, or at the leaſt, defended, and the bad ſuppreſſed, or at the leaſt repreſſed.
<pb facs="tcp:16801:8"/>
Then the account that God will require for the innocent blood, that hath beene there cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly ſpilt by Traytors, and for the miſerable oppreſſion of the better ſort of your Maieſties Subiects, who haue beene there burned, raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, robbed, and ſpoyled: the cry whereof is now ſhrill in Gods eare, for vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe cruell Rebels, and diſordered dealers.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon, is a preſent vrging ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, which may not be neglected, but with dangerous errour in pollicy of Gouernement. For remit this Rebellion, and yeeld wholly and for euer the Lamb to the Wolfe, and the Subiect to the Traytor, who will ſo keepe him vnder, that hee ſhall neither will nor dare euer hereafter to oppoſe himſelfe on your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties behalfe or Seruice.</p>
            <p>The third reaſon is commodity: For (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that all rules and orders for reformation, may thereupon be the more readily and leſſe chargeably put in execution) there will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheate to your Maieſty by due courſe of Iuſtice the better halfe of that Land, whereof what great <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ue may in ſhort time accrew to your Maieſtie, ouer and aboue, what may be imployed to reward and ſtrengthen thoſe that are dutifully diſpoſed, ſhall in part appeare in place, where the commodities of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhall purpoſely be ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>Thus it appeareth, that the ſeuere correction
<pb facs="tcp:16801:9"/>
of this Rebellion, is the firſt and ſoundeſt ſtep of reformation, and that the ſame is grounded vpon duty to God, neceſſity, pollicy, and commodity; all which points would yeeld a larger diſcourſe, if that it were either my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or needfull to your Maieſty, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and vnderſtandeth all.</p>
            <p>Leaſt ſome might draw this mine opinion of a ſeuere correction, into the reckoning of a more cruell ſentence then I meane: I proteſt it is farre from me to deſire any extirpation; but rather that all might bee ſaued, that were good for the Country to be ſaued. Yet this I ſay, Till your Maieſties Sword hath meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all, I thinke it neither Honour nor ſafety to graunt mercy to any. But when the Sword hath made a way, then, as to pardon all, would be too remiſſe a pitty: So, not to pardon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, would be an extremity nothing agreeable to your Maieſties moſt godly and mercifull inclination. Otherwiſe there would be ſuch a vacuity of ground there, (as it is already too great) that your Realme of <hi>England,</hi> though it be moſt populous, through your Maieſties moſt godly Gouernement, (God be thanked, and long continue it) were not able to ſpare people, to repleniſh the waſts.</p>
            <p>It reſteth now to ſpeake of the particular meanes, as well to repreſſe this Rebellion, as thereupon to reforme the Realme. Firſt, very good choyſe being made (as there is already)
<pb facs="tcp:16801:9"/>
of your Deputy, it is moſt requiſite (for the time of his continuance in that Seruice, which in my opinion had need be ſeuen yeeres for ſo great a worke) that all his actions there be throughly backed by your Maieſtie, and none of them croſſed, to worke him your Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties diſgrace (which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> will ſoone eſpie) either by ſuggeſtions thence, or practiſes here, during his continuance in charge there; but vpon his diſcharge to anſwere all with his life and liuing: your Maieſties Deputy being thus fortified with credit, he muſt alſo be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained with ſufficiency of men, money, munition, and victuals: but before I ſpeake of them, I thinke it neceſſary to remember, that for the principall points of the gouernment of that Land, it ſhall bee requiſite that certaine rules be preſcribed to euery Deputy by your Maieſtie, and Counſell here. And yet he not to be ſo tyed to any of them, but that vpon vrgent cauſes he may breake or altar them.</p>
            <p>To returne to prouiſion. And firſt for men. All wards being furniſhed, I take 800 Engliſh horſemen: 3000 Engliſh foot-men, and 1000 Galloglaghes, Kerne, and Iriſh ſhott will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for this purpoſe: But becauſe it ſhall bee neceſſary to eaſe your Maieſties good ſubiects of the Ceſſe for the ſouldiors, wherwith they haue beene hitherto burthened, I thinke it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that in leuy of that Ceſſe, the pay be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rates inſuing, as your Maieſtie
<pb facs="tcp:16801:10"/>
alloweth in all your other ſeruices. And the rather in reſpect as well of the painfull dangers that theſe Souldiers muſt abide, as alſo that they may liue without rauine and ſpoyle.</p>

            <p>Here (by the way) I thinke it expedient, for auoyding of confuſion of new and old recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings together, that old former payes and debts remaining in arrerages vnto the taking of this ſeruice in hand be cleared, and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And then for this new reckoning thus made, it behoueth to ſhew how or whence the money may be leauied. In mine opinion, (the things before rehearſed aduiſedly conſidered) it were mony well beſtowed for ſo good a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, though the whole came directly out of your Highneſſe Treaſure; And yet it is to be remembred, that beſides your Maieſties conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall yeerely charge which is not ſmall, you haue in ſome one yeere (as I am giuen to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand) ſpent as much as this vpon that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſeruice. But conſidering the great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that your Maieſtie hath and muſt ſuſtaine otherwayes for the ſafety of your people and
<pb facs="tcp:16801:11"/>
Countries, you may in reaſon and honor admit an extraordinary remedie, though at the firſt ſight, it carry ſome ſhew of an inconuenience. I ſuppoſe therefore (vnder correction) that it ſhall be good, that your Maieſtie after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of France, Spaine and Flanders, where moſt of the ſmall money conſiſteth of baſe coynes, doe alſo cauſe to bee coyned yeerely during the firſt foure yeeres, 100000 <hi>li.</hi> in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of 8 <hi>d.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> 2 <hi>d.</hi> and 1 <hi>d.</hi> the ſame to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, but a fourth part of fine ſiluer, letting all coines that are currant there of good gold and ſiluer to run as now they doe: ſo your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties charge, beſides all charges of coynage, wil amount to no more but 25000 <hi>lib.</hi> yeerely which in foure yeeres would come to 100000 <hi>lib.</hi> which by that time your Maieſtie with Gods fauour ſhould ſee would bring you a faire reckoning of that countrey and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The place fit for coynage, whether at the Tower of London, or any other port towne of England that hath more commoditie for fewell, or elſe rather in Ireland. I referre to your Maieſties, and Counſels conſiderations. If in Ireland, I thinke it very neceſſary to call in all the baſe money that is there now cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, paying ready ſterling mony for the ſame, at the rates it now goeth. The maſſe of that baſe money would preſently ſet the mint a worke: and being new molten, would with
<pb facs="tcp:16801:11"/>
ſome ſupply ſerue this turne. This being thought good: then ſurely the Towne of Roſſe in the Countie of Wexford will bee a moſt apt place for the mint, by reaſon of the great abundance of wood which groweth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Riuer that commeth cloſe by that town, the felling whereof will be ſeruiceable; not onely for this worke, but alſo for the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe of the countrey there abouts.</p>
            <p>Some ſcruple may bee made here by the late experience of this Realme, what inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences may grow by imbaſing the coyne. It cannot be denied, but it was ſomewhat incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for this Realme, liuing vnder ciuill and orderly gouernment: yet the neceſſitie of the weighty ſeruice then being ſupplied by it, wee ſee all the inconueniences well ouercome through your Maieſties peaceable gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (God be thanked for it.) But the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Realme, or of any other common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth already reformed doth not hold in this caſe: For, as imbaſing of coyne and ſuch like dangerous innouocations may breed harme in well gouerned States: So in <hi>Ireland</hi> being all out of order it can doe no harme at all, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is to be hoped, that the admiſſion of this one ſmall inconuenience, may be a meane to redreſſe, not onely a number of other greater inconueniences, but alſo it ſelfe too withall in the end.</p>
            <p>Let it be confeſſed, that the prices of things
<pb facs="tcp:16801:12"/>
will by that meanes within a yeare or two, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſcouery of the baſeneſſe, riſe to double, and that both Souldier and Country man ſhal for the time looſe accordingly.</p>
            <p>If the reformation doe immediatly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the loſſe treble, then may I aske, what harme hath either Souldier or Country man receiued? That it will ſo, may appeare thus. Scarce the fourth foote of <hi>Ireland</hi> is at this houre manured; and of that ſcarce the fourth penny profit made, that the ſoyle would yeeld, if through a reformation the Husbandman might haue a ſafe and peaceable vſe both of it and of his Cattell. And yet I ſay nothing of Mynes, and a number of other hidden Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities that a ciuill reformed Gouernement would bring with it. Now it may pleaſe your Maieſty, that I may reckon, and reaſon thus: Firſt, coyning in foure yeares 400000 pound, your Maieſties turne is ſerued for 100000 pound. Then calling it downe at ſixe yeares end, to the iuſt value it is worth, whereby it will be for euer after a very neceſſary Coyne to bee currant, for the reliefe of your poore Subiects, not onely of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Country ſhall loſe 300000 pound. That this ſhall be treble recompenced, by the reformation I ſuppoſe will thus bee prooued. Allow (for example) that the whole profit of <hi>Ireland</hi> is not yearely aboue 100000 pound. Adde to this a treble profit in quantity of
<pb facs="tcp:16801:12"/>
ground to be manured, and another treble in quality of manuring, for two yeares betwixt the end of the Coynage and the fall, allowing the firſt foure yeares to be fruitleſly ſpent in reforming (though there bee hope that that time will be ſhortned) I thinke the reckoning of a treble recompence, falleth out apparantly. In theſe matters of State, there can be nothing ſet downe ſo plaine, that will not admit a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. And therefore (perhaps) it may be ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is a good and eaſie ſpeculation. But I truſt (God giuing good encreaſe) it will proue as good and as eaſie an action. To God therefore, and to your Maieſties gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, I thus leaue it.</p>
            <p>Victualls and Munition are now to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for. And ſure there muſt be ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had of both. Experience of the miſery, and defect in Sernice, I found that way ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me to giue this ſpeciall caution, leauing all particular direction thereof, to thoſe that haue better skill therein then I haue. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, the chiefe Victualer being choſen a man of good ſubſtance, skill, and conſcience, he had neede (in mine opinion) be impreſted 10000 pound currant money of <hi>England</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good ſureties, not onely to anſwere the Stock, but alſo to haue Grainers of Corne in places apt for the Seruice.</p>
            <p>Theſe things thus prouided; In mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the ſtanding ſeate for the Deputy and
<pb facs="tcp:16801:13"/>
the Law, would bee tranſlated from <hi>Dublin,</hi> (which is apt for nothing elſe, but to ſend and receiue readily from <hi>England)</hi> to <hi>Atblon,</hi> which is (as it were) the Centre of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate both in a good ſoyle, apt for all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and on the <hi>Shennon,</hi> which is the beſt Riuer of the Realme, and would with a ſmall charge be made portable twenty miles aboue <hi>Athlon</hi> at leaſt. By that meanes, as the Deputy may vpon euery occaſion (be it neuer ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine) be within twelue houres in the fartheſt Prouince fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: So in ſhort time the repaire hither from all quarters of the Realme, would breede a thorow-fare, euen through Deſarts and Woods, that are now lurking holes for Rebels, and Nourceries for Rebellion.</p>
            <p>The Deputy thus furniſhed and ſeated, he had neede for his better aſſiſtance, to haue two Preſidents with competent Officers to thoſe States, and thoſe ſuch men for Religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, courage, diligence, and ability both of bodies and purſes, as reſpecting their duties to God and your Maieſty, the good of their Country and their owne credites, may attend their charges conſtantly againſt all toyleſome dangers, &amp; corrupt gaine, ſhewing themſelues in all their actions reformers &amp; not deformers.</p>
            <p>Their ſtanding ſeates will be moſt apt, the one for <hi>Mounſter</hi> at <hi>Killmallock,</hi> the other for <hi>Vlſter</hi> at <hi>Liffuer.</hi> So (as occaſion ſhall require) may they beſt anſwere the Deputy, and the
<pb facs="tcp:16801:13"/>
Deputy then being, as it were, in the middeſt betwixt them, of equall diſtance from them both.</p>
            <p>Then there is needfull to be two Marſhalls, who being aptly choſen for the purpoſe, ſhould at the direction of the Deputy and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents goe to one exployt, while they be ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at ſome other, or elſe otherwiſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily miniſtring Iuſtice. Thus the Deputy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, and they aſſiſting one another, both the labour will be the eaſier, and the Enemie the more doubtfull, being ſet to fiue ſeuerall wayes. As before of the Deputy, ſo here of theſe Officers, I thinke it requiſite that their Seruice haue ſome limitation of time, and that the Preſidents fiue yeares, vnleſſe ſicknes, or other neceſſity occaſion the contrary. And for the Marſhalls, it were not amiſſe they were made Patentees to continue during life, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe through misbehauiour they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to be diſplaced, or through good deſert to be better aduanced.</p>
            <p>In choiſe of the Lord Chauncellour and all other Officers, there would be like regard had, that through needineſſe they bee not carried from Iuſtice, which next vnder God muſt bee the chiefeſt reformer. The like is to be ſaid of the Clarke of the Check, that he be a carefull man to ſee the bands full.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Captaines, their Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that they make neither a Harueſt of the
<pb facs="tcp:16801:14"/>
Seruice, nor a ſpoyle of the Subiects, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (together with ſeeking to ſuppreſſe the Rebellion without malice to any mans perſon) to ſowe the ſeede of good example, whereby both themſelues, and thoſe that their Seruice ſhall be meane to reforme, may reape of God and your Maieſty an honeſt &amp; godly Harueſt, to the iuſt reward of their Seruices both for bodies and ſoules.

            <p>Hee deuided the greater gouernments into ſmaller, that no one ſhould be too ſtrong for another, and yet each ſhould haue ſufficient, if not to ſatisfie himſelfe, yet to ballance the ouer-growing greatneſſe of his neighbour: but indeede his chiefeſt ayme was to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the greatneſſe of <hi>Oneale,</hi> which name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the barbarous people of that whole Prouince had in ſo great adoration, as neither the law formerly made in Sir <hi>Henry Sidneys</hi> time, (a moſt worthy Gouernour,) nor any iniunction of State could aboliſh, what time and ignorance had ſo eſtabliſhed.

Theſe courſes were of more importance, then by ſome are conceiued to be: for Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſours of great Territories, and Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of many people, being proud of their owne greatneſſe, and enflamed with deſire of Dominion; drawe many to follow them through the flames of commotion: And the leſſer, eſpecially the ſecond ſort, either coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to be higher, or binding themſelues to the will of their Superiours, that are able to command, runne headlong at their direction, and by conſenting, or diſcenting in times of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, ioyne onely in the bad effects, to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the State, and to deſtroy or vexe thoſe that are beſt affected. <hi>Vlſter</hi> thus ſuddainly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, reuolting hearts partly pacified, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtrained to obedience; a compoſition of benefit to the Queene, and the Countries qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ſetled.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16801:34"/>
encreaſed the Princes power. This his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ratified by like Letters written by ſuch of the Priuy Councell, as did accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him in theſe his iourneyes; wherein it is to be noted, that it was a wiſe part of the Deputy to cauſe his actions to be iuſtified by others, who were, Generall <hi>Norreys,</hi> Sir <hi>Lucas Dillon,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Councels report to the Lords, of the ſucceſſe in <hi>Vlſter.</hi>

            <p>Thus much to the indifferent: But moſt of our great men did not relliſh Sir <hi>Iohn Perrots</hi> ſtoutneſſe, who ſtoode vpon his owne feete onely without dependancy, vpon any of them, but the Queene alone, which made them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious of all his good Seruices, but now their mouthes were ſtopped, her Maieſtie being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the trueth by ſo indifferent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators.</p>
            <p>Now was it found time by the Deputy, to conſult how theſe good beginnings might be proſecuted, and that which was done, might not be euerted by the inconſtancy of a waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

and yet vnbrideled people, who being brought by force onely to yeeld to that which is good, will bee good no longer then while force conſtraines them, vntill their ignorance, how farre the good extendes to their owne particular, be taken away by their taſte and feeling, which in an inſtant comes not to <note place="margin">The Deputy writes for Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to be ſent out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

He likewiſe propounded, that the large and vnbounded Countries of the North, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts, might be deuided into ſmall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for the better gouerning of the rude and vnruly people, who might learne ciuility, and know the lawes, and by that knowledge be brought to loue that, vnder which they did enioy their owne, whereof they were now ignorant.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Deputies offer, if 50000 pound might be ſpared for three yeares.</note> Hee offered farther, that if 50000 pound might be added to the reuenew of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but for three yeares to come, he would not onely therewith ſupport the charge of the State: but wall ſeauen Townes, and

build as many Bridges in places now ſcarce paſſable, (eſpecially in the Winter) and erect ſo many ſtrong Caſtles in places of perill: withall 2000 Foote, and 400 Horſe, ſhould bee maintained by this allowance, ſupplyed by the Northerne compoſition, during the time.</p>
            <p>This ſumme, though it ſeemed great, yet was leſſe then her Maieſtie many times was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to expend for the ſuppreſſing of a light Rebellion, and the preſeruation of her good Subiects, without any other fruit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or aſſurance of future Peace: So as this charge (thus imployed) would not onely ſecure the whole Countrey for the preſent, but make other Seruice of importance more eaſie after to bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>Hee added to theſe motions, others of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence for execution of Iuſtice, (a chiefe meane to breede in the people awfull loue and ciuility) as that a chiefe Iuſtice of <note place="margin">The Deputy demaunds a chiefe Iuſtice out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

beſeech you to reuiew the ancient State of this Kingdom, and it will appeare by good demonſtrations, not vnknowne to ſome of that moſt Noble Aſſembly, that our Predeceſſours in a very ſhort time planted in euery part of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Cities, Towns, &amp; Caſtles, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doe remaine yet the Reliques euen in <hi>Vlſter</hi> (where Barbariſme moſt preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) &amp; yeelded vnto <hi>England</hi> great yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuenewes; the decayes thereof grew from Gods heauy hand, viſiting the Enemies of that time, firſt vpon <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and conſequently vpon <hi>Ireland,</hi> as an appendix by the diuiſion of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the harmes (God bee praiſed) is repaired againe in <hi>England</hi> by the happy Vnion of thoſe two Houſes (all being of one Nation; but not in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the <hi>Iriſh</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that diuiſion vnder the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, raiſed heere for the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the ſame, not vnknowne
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16801:41"/>
to ſome of you that haue had the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of theſe cauſes of this State: Much bloud hath ſince beene ſpilt, and an infinite treaſure conſumed to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that dammage, through a deadly hate conceiued betweene the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that not without the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the degenerate <hi>Engliſh,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the late Earle of <hi>Deſmond</hi> may bee an example for the reſt.</p>
                        <p>This diſſention hath beene euer ſince maintained, and lately nouriſhed by the needy <hi>Scots</hi> of the out Iles, and lately by the Popes crue vnder <hi>Saunders,</hi> vpon whom Gods curſe preuailed againſt their Chiefetaines bleſsing.</p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee, how this matter hath long hung in queſtion, what miſery and miſchiefe hath enſued thereof, and what honour and profit it was, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine would be vnto <hi>England,</hi> if it were redreſſed.</p>
                        <p>It remaineth: I ſhew not onely the good occaſions, and meanes thereof
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16801:41"/>
now offered; but alſo the good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to enſue, and ſo to conclude with my humble Petition for your ayde. Heretofore the <hi>Iriſh</hi> haue beene iealous of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> immagining that not themſelues, but the recouery of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped Lands haue beene ſought, and the degenerate <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as <hi>Deſmond</hi> and ſome others, haue fallen into the ſame errors, which hath made them to ſpurn againſt all Authority, and vſe the ayde of the <hi>Scots,</hi> almoſt to their owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation.</p>
                        <p>But now her Maieſties mercy, and gracious meaning, being publiquely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced vpon the ouerthrow of the Rebels and Forraigne Enemies, that her Highneſſe equally ballanceth her Subiects, according to their due deſerts, without reſpect of Nation, as hauing intereſt from GOD in them all alike: they ſee their errour, not onely in flying from ſo gracious a Princes and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne; but alſo in embracing the needy
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16801:42"/>
rauenous <hi>Scot,</hi> that had well-nigh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured them all. And therefore I am farre from the opinion of thoſe, that would haue the <hi>Iriſh</hi> extirped, ſith I ſee that the occaſion of diſſention being now taken away, they are (as I ſuppoſe) eaſily made one with vs, and ſo as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be continued, as any other genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatſoeuer, that in their place ſhould be planted.</p>
                        <p>I make this collection by proofe, I haue had not onely of their willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ioyne with mee in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of the <hi>Scots,</hi> but alſo to yeeld their Lands ſimply, as many of the beſt haue done, and the reſt are ready to doe, to be reſumed of her Maieſtie, by Tenures, Rents, and Seruices, both honourable and profitable to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, ſeruiceable to the State, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to themſelues; which I haue made particularly knowne to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and the Lords of her moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Priuie Counſell.</p>
                        <p>

Hereunto I haue to adde, that they are moſt willing, and ready to leaue olde <hi>Iriſh</hi> exactions vpon their Free-Holders and Tenants, and to conuert the ſame to Rents certaine, whereof what wealth and quietneſſe is like to enſue, I will leaue to the report of ſome of you, that know this State: for I ſhould trouble you too tediouſly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe it particularly.</p>
                        <p>I haue beſides ſo preuailed with them as well by good dealings, as by ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling them with her Maieſties Forces, that I haue wonne them to entertaine <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldiers inſtead of <hi>Scots;</hi> ſo as I haue compounded with the Chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of <hi>Vlſter,</hi> for the maintenance of 1000 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldiers, and doe mean to proceed with the reſt, with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent anon, and to their owne good, that I hope to haue a trayned Garriſon here in a readineſſe of two thouſand foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and foure hundred Horſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for all euents, and thoſe in time

to be but a ſmall charge to her Maieſtie, and that Realme.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe occaſions may in ſome mens opinion ſeeme good, but vncertaine, and ſo indeede are, as all occaſions are, if they be not well taken hold of, and that in time. For the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> as all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde beſides, yea, euen borne in <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex,</hi> as naturally ſlippery, vncertaine, and vnruly: and therefore the meanes to be vſed to make them ſtayed, certaine, and orderly, which are partly by Iuſtice, and partly by force: Iuſtice may bee execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſmall boaſt, but ſo cannot force, and yet the force I meane is not violable, but benefie all to the whole State.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebell, and his <hi>Scottiſh</hi> partaker, or rather maintainer, doe greatly truſtin in their aduantage of Wood and Bogg, where they runne vp and downe ſauagely, and in our diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage (eſpecially in <hi>Vlſter</hi> the <hi>Scot</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riueth) through want of Bridges,

With thoſe new Buildings, or rather for the moſt part reparations of olde ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, and thoſe that be already, the Realme will be as it were walled in (as vpon view of the Charter) will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto you: and by Gods grace, I truſt not onely thereby mutuall Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique and amity will growe, the waſte part of this Land may be planned, and peopled with good Subiects, thoſe that be dutifull ſtrengthned and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and thoſe repreſſed that are ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; but alſo that the compoſition al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made, or here after to be made for the numbers before mentioned, may be holden good, as alſo other matters of honour and profit to both the Realmes, may be brought to paſſe.</p>

               </note>on) is now ſummoned to be held at <hi>Dublin,</hi> where the Nobility, Clergie, and Commons, being aſſembled, Order was taken, that none <note place="margin">Order for <hi>Iriſh</hi> apparell, not to be worne in Parliament.</note>were permitted to goe in <hi>Iriſh</hi> attire (as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time they vſed) but to ſort themſelues in ſuch habite after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> manner, as was anſwerable to their ſeuerall rankes and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and becauſe the charge might breede no difficulty with the chiefe men in Parliament, to yeeld to this Order. Hee beſtowed vpon <hi>Tirlogh Leynogh,</hi> the principle Lord of <hi>Vlſter,</hi> and on ſome others, chiefe of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> Gowns and other Roabes fit for that place, and their degrees; which they embraced like fetters: of which being weary, one of them came to the Deputy, and beſought him, that one of his Chaplaines (which hee called Prieſts) might goe with him along through the Streetes, clad in his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Trouſes: for then (quoth he) the Boyes will laugh as faſt at him, as they now
<pb facs="tcp:16801:46"/>
doe at me, whereat though the Deputy could haue ſmiled; yet caſting a frowne vpon his countenance, told him, there was no cauſe he ſhould thinke any laughed at him, for wearing thoſe which were fit ornaments for the place he now held, and did preſent in Parliament: but if any did ſo, it was at his ill wearing of the ſame, which want of ciuill cuſtome cauſed: Therefore ſince vſe would make that ſeemely, which now was ridiculous, he aduiſed him to view the difference of being fit for all Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and onely fit for the Woods and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Places; but (quoth the Deputy) if any idle or ill affected perſon ſhall put the contrary into your head, beleeue it to be done out of an ill meaning to the State, and worſe vnto your perſon, for contempt of order and decencie, will in the end be your downfall. This aduice was taken eyther as found good, or out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to be followed: but hereby wee may diſcerne that cuſtome, is commonly preferred before decency, and opinion before reaſon, eſpecially amongſt people where ciuility is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted; Withall it is to be obſerued in the <note place="margin">The reaſon, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are vnwilling to ſort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the <hi>Engliſh habit.</hi>
               </note>proud condition of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that they diſdaine to ſort themſelues in faſhion vnto vs, which in their opinion would more plainely manifeſt our Conqueſt ouer them; and this I take to be the cauſe of their vntowardneſſe in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, which made the Deputy to ſet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation more to heart, well knowing that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16801:47"/>
the Lords and chiefe of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> framing themſelues in habite and plaineneſſe to their Vnderlings, made themſelues the more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular. Willing or vnwilling, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned to come to the Parliament in that ciuill habit, which did beſt fit the place and preſent ſeruice.</p>
            <p>In this Parliament, which began at <hi>Dublin</hi> the 26 of Aprill 1585, in the 27 yeare of the Queenes Reigne. Sundry Bills were paſſed in the firſt Seſſion, which being Enacted, and new Printed, therefore neede here no further mention; but their diſputes and differences aroſe about a Bill preferred in the Commons <note place="margin">A Bill for the ſuſpenſion of <hi>Poynings</hi> Acts.</note>Houſe, for the ſuſpention of <hi>Poynings</hi> Act, which paſt in the tenth yeare of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeauenth, before Sir <hi>Edward Poynings</hi> then Deputy. That no Bill ſhould paſſe in any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for a Law, vntill the ſame had firſt a Royall aſſent in <hi>England.</hi> This the Deputy would haue ſuſpended by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to the end, that opportunity might be taken for paſſing ſuch Bills, as the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion might offer for the good of the Seruice, without attending the further reſolution of <hi>England:</hi> whereby the aduantage of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing preſent Seruices might be loſt, making that by delay more vnpaſſable, which at the preſent, might eaſily be perfected: But this, howſoeuer grounded vpon good iudgement by the Deputy, was impugned, eſpecially by

ſome chiefe ſtirrers in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pale, and ouerthrowne by them at the third reading, (who feared perchance, that ſomething might be propounded, and ſpeedily Enacted, which might croſſe ſome purpoſes of their owne) and therefore by ſuſpition were caried to their own preiudice; yet afterwards vpon better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation (that doubt being cleared) they then ſeemed more enclinable to the paſſage of the Bill, and vpon demaund obtained conference with the Deputy, touching the ſame, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, ſeeming ſatisfied in their duties; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Parliament was adiourned for three weekes.

Notwithſtanding, this diſcention about <hi>Poynings</hi> Act (whereof ſome that did moſt in publique oppoſe it, did afterwards in priuate confeſſe their errour) yet diuers profitable Acts were paſſed, both for the priuate and publique in this firſt Seſſion, which ended the 25 of May, and was prorogued till Aprill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.

Aduerſary pretended; alleadging a dangerous conſequence, to breede feare, doubt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe in the Natiues, which were but ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, to hinder ſuch ſeruices, as would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be performed without perill; finding now the pride and power of the euill affected <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to be altogether abated, and the people encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to yeeld conformity vnto his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Therefore it ſeemed fit to him to take the opportunity which the time offered, to worke that which former time could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe. But finding all this (how neceſſary ſo euer) croſſed by them, which ſhould rather haue giuen furtherance to it, conſtruing his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions astending to innouation, likely to ſtirre diſſention, and produce danger. He confeſſed that he was much diſconraged, but yet would purſue his courſe in the beſt manner he could (being ſo reſtrayned.) For the view of mens Charters, wherewith hee was charged, hee denied that euer he intended, much leſſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed the Accuſers malice and ſlander.

And to ſtrengthen this their information, to the end hee might be made the more diſtaſtfull to her Maieſtie, and the Lords of her Counſell. Some of the Lords of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pale, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited <note place="margin">The Lords of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pale write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty.</note>to write vnto the Queene 15 Iuly 1585, in complaint againſt the Deputy, that ouer and beſides a compoſition of two thouſand pounds yearely reuennew formerly made in lieu of Ceſs, and other charges claimed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by Prerogatiue vnto the State, from the fiue Counties of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to impoſe a ſecond charge of fifteene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound <hi>per Anum</hi> ſterling; ſo making the yoake of her Gouernment to appeare heauie and inſupportable.

            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe complaints, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and backbitings, the Deputy like a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Common-wealths man, and iuſt ſeruant to his Prince, profeſſed he would proceede on to the diſcharge of his duty, as long as he held that place, eſteeming it better to be diſgraced for doing well, then to be remiſs in doing well.

            <p>Theſe complaints being by the Deputy ſent to <hi>Tyrone,</hi> he maketh anſwer, that firſt for <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loghs</hi> Tenants, that ſince <hi>Tirlogh</hi> was not able to reſtraine his people from annoying his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, hee was not to refuſe any that would come from <hi>Tirlogh</hi> to liue vnder him: denieth any killing or preying vpon <hi>Tirlogh;</hi> his men or Country by him or his men for the arreare of Rent due or claymed to bee due, hee partly denyeth, and partly euades the payment.</p>

being growne olde, and forſaken by many of his followers, either for want of protection from <hi>Tirlogh,</hi> or feare of the Earles encreaſing greatneſſe, <hi>Tyrone</hi> giues another blowe to <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logh,</hi> by taking a prey of 2000 Cowes, with many Mares and Garons, from Sir <hi>Arte Oneale Tirloghs</hi> ſonne, whereof the Deputy being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, ſent to <hi>Tyrone</hi> what was enformed; and to require him, both to forbeare further acts of hoſtility, and to reſtore what had been ſo taken from <hi>Tirloghs</hi> ſonne or his Tennants, to which the Earle maketh anſwere by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Sir <hi>Arte Oneale,</hi> to haue taken a prey from his people, at his laſt being at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of reſtitution which he demaunded, ſent the Earle defiance, when he required peace to be obſerued.

another, and to the Earle he ſignified, that if it were true that he had receiued ſome iniuries at the hands of Sir <hi>Arthur Oneale,</hi> yet it could not be lawfull, that he ſhould be a reuenger of his owne wrongs, and if he had ſuſtained any ſuch domage as hee pretended, hee had being his owne caruer, ouer-recompenced himſelfe for the preiudice done vnto him.

him to runne vp by <hi>Donagall,</hi> as farre as hee could vnto <hi>Odonnels</hi> Country, where he ſhould not onely offer to ſell at a cheape price, but be liberall in giuing Wine to ſuch as ſhould come aboard him: And that if <hi>Odonnell</hi> or his ſonne came aboard him by that meanes, (as he knew they would) hee ſhould giue them ſo much as might make them forget themſelues, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drunke, ſhould clap them vnder hatch, and bring them away to <hi>Dublin.</hi> This deuice was as carefully performed as proiected, young <hi>Odonnell</hi> being by this meanes ſurprized and brought away: A Seruice at that time very auaileable to the State, for keeping that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in quiet, and reſtraining ſo ſtirring a perſon as <hi>Odonnell</hi> was, from the purſuite of his euill affections, bent at that time againſt the Queene and her Seruice: Notwithſtanding, afterwards in the enſuing trouble, it was imputed as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie done to <hi>Odonnell;</hi> and interpreted as an act that did rather interrupt, then preſerue the Peace of that Country; the State thinking that the blame which ſhould be layd vpon Sir <note place="margin">A ſimple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Councell of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <hi>Iohn Perrots</hi> carriage herein would pleaſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donnell,</hi> and make him the more apt to bee drawne to conformity and obedience; but this ſhallow and colloguing pollicy, did worke little effect in him, whoſe heart was wholly (by forraigne practiſe) alienated from his loyalty, and by marriage of <hi>Tyrones</hi> Daughter, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deuoted to his faction and Seruice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>The Deputy thus buſied in the publique, receiues a new interruption by the meanes of his Aduerſaries, who had cauſed a Letter to be written to the Queene, in the name of <hi>Tirlogh</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A letter coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſaited to be written by <hi>Tirlogh Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naugh</hi> to the Queene, but diſauowed by himſelfe.</note>
               <hi>Leynaugh,</hi> complayning of the Deputies hard vſage of him, which being certified to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, much troubled him (becauſe one of his greateſt Seruices, was the conforming this man to bee a faithfull ſeruant to the State) to finde <hi>Tirlogh</hi> Alyend from him; but <hi>Tirlogh</hi> had no ſooner notice hereof, but hee ſent one <hi>Salomon</hi> his Secretary into <hi>England</hi> to diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowe this Letter, proteſting hee neuer cauſed any ſuch to be written, neither had hee cauſe, the Lord Deputy alwayes vſing him well, and doing him many fauours; and therefore hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſired, that the Author of this forgerie might be puniſhed: But the Deputies reſpect in <hi>England</hi> being extenuated by continuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation againſt him thence, little was done to his ſatisfaction in this particular, and the leſſe, becauſe the whole State was filled with the forraigne preparation threatned againſt <hi>England,</hi> and her Maieſties Dominions; which his Enemies finding, grew more inſolent in croſſing and oppoſing his endeuours, which ſo wearied his impatient Nature, as hee made all the meanes hee could, both by his owne continuall ſuite, and by the preſſing mediation
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16801:83"/>
of his friends in Court, to be reuoked thence; <note place="margin">The Queene graunts the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue of the Deputy.</note>which by long importunity he at length obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned promiſe of from the Queene, who ſent him word ſhee would ſhortly prouide him a Succeſſour.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, to preuent farther trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that he might leaue all things in as great ſecurity as poſſibly he could, hee (as one of his laſt, but not leaſt Seruices) ſends for all the Lords and Chiefes, which might in any <note place="margin">The Deputy taketh pledges of all the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected perſons in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note>part bee ſuſpected, to take part with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Enemie, if any attempt ſhould be made in that Kingdome by them as was doubted, and of all theſe demaunded Pledges for their owne faithfulneſſe, and the quietneſſe of their people: and for the more eaſie enclining them to this demaund, which ſeemed at firſt harſh vnto them, he made a ſolemne ſpeech, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee declared, that it was done as well for their owne good, as for the Kingdomes quiet, for hee knew that the Queene would be well pleaſed with their willingneſſe, to yeeld teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their loyalty vnto her, which could not but make them better accepted, &amp; truſted in the time to come; proteſting that if the caſe concerned him as it did them, he ſhould chuſe rather at this time to be bound, then to be left at liberty, within the danger of ſuſpition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deepe corroſiue to euery well meaning man, as he aſſured himſelfe they all were, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouer their former ſlips had made them apt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16801:83"/>
to be doubted, aduiſing them to vſe all good meanes for the conſeruation of Peace in each of their Dominions, whereby their pledges might ſhortly haue freedome, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues gaine a better eſtimation for euer.</p>
            <p>By this perſwaſſion they did with leſſe grudging and contradiction yeeld pledges, which were beſtowed in the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſo as all the Heads of all the Prouinces in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were tyed by this meanes to quietneſſe and ſubiection, which at that time was moſt neceſſary, becauſe the Deputy by diuers good intelligences out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whereof hee had giuen ſpeedy and often information in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> knew the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> preparations were great, and whether intended for <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or for both, was not certaine, but <hi>Ireland</hi> threatned by the common bruite.</p>
            <p>This done, the Deputy writes againe to the Queene, humbly thanking her, that at his ſuit, and for the recouery of his health, which now began to impaire, ſhee had beene plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to promiſe his diſcharge from that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and withall beſought her ſpeedily to ſend his Succeſſour, vſing the ſame reaſons he had formerly done, when it was bruited he ſhould bee remoued, before it was intended, the looſe people being indeede apt out of their euill affection, to take aduantage of the time, and to attempt that, which they durſt

not doe in a confirmed and well countenanced Gouernement.</p>
            <p>At length when this good Deputy had go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned foure yeares with much trauaile, and good ſucceſſe; notwithſtanding, the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mentioned in this diſcourſe, of priuate and particular Aduerſaries (the enuiers of his felicity) hee obtained his diſcharge.
