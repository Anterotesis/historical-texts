            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>AS the contradiction is not in our Assertions, but in their misunderstanding: So might I, by good right, forbeare to meddle about <hi>Adams sin,</hi> in the case of <hi>predestination;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the determination of the Synode at <hi>Dort</hi> hereabout, which I take upon me to defend: which considers <hi>man as fallen</hi> in Gods account, as the object of the Predestination in question. But I will not use all my lawfull liberty; but as he that will overtake and hold a malefactour, must follow him, not onely in the high and beaten way, whilst he keeps it, but in all the out-leaps also, and turnings, which he makes: So, God assisting me, purpose I (though it be troublesome) to follow and prosecute these Adversaries in this, and other their particular straglings, if any way pertinent to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall controversie.</p>
               <p>I affirm then, that Gods decree, and ordination about <hi>Adams</hi> fall was such, as that the same could not but follow therupon; not as an effect, upon a cause working it (God forbid); but as a consequent upon an antecedent; or as an event necessarily following upon a most holy, wise and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full providence; so ordering and disposing, that the same should so come to passe infallibly, though performed by <hi>Adams</hi> free, and freely working will. If any demand how this can be, that God who forbiddeth and hateth sinne, yet should so order persons and things, by his providence, and so from eternity purpose to order them, as that the same can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be? I answer, by free acknowledgment, that the

manner of Gods working herein is to me, and to all men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiueable; and withall avouch, that he, who will not confesse, that God can (and could in <hi>Adams</hi> sin) by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wisedom and power, most effectually, and infallibly, in regard of such event, order and dispose of things, without violation to his holinesse, or violence to the creatures will, as no mortall man is able to conceiue the manner therof, is himselfe in a high degree, guilty of that pride, which was <hi>Adams</hi>

               <p>THat God suffered, and so decreed to suffer the wicked to kill his sonne, is plaine. If he had not decreed to suffer them, he had not suffered them; if he had not suffered them, they could not haue done it: but that he onely suffered them, is against the expresse words and meaning of the text, which sayth, the <hi>wicked took</hi> him, <hi>being delivered by Gods determinato counsell.</hi> Is to deliver by determinate counsell, to suffer onely? So where it is sayd, that Gods <hi>hand determined</hi> that which <hi>was done,</hi> it shewes that God was a doer in the businesse, and not a sufferer onely. If God onely suffered them, (that is, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them not) he had no hand in it at all, but with-held his hand from medling in it. How then could his <hi>hand and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seli determine before whatsoever was done?</hi> Besides, if God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffered the death of his sonne, all the worth of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by his death, vanisheth away: seeing that which God suffers onely, is onely evill, and not good. Also by this perverse exposition, neither the Father <hi>gaue his sonne,</hi> nor the sonne <hi>himselfe for us to the death,</hi> which the Scriptures every where affirme. Lastly, hee that considers the end of the<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16. Gal. 2. 20. 1. Ioh. 4. 9. Rom 5. vers 25. 29.</note> Churches prayer, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. will plainly see how they meant therein to ascribe unto God more then the sole suffering of those things. The end was to comfort themselues and other Gods servants against the <hi>threatnings</hi> and <hi>rage</hi> of the wicked in all their persecutions. But what comfort (I marvail) can the servants of God draw from this consideration, that God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the wicked in rage to persecute them, and hinders
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14749:6"/>
them not. This were indeed rather matter of discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and dispaire, then of comfort unto them. But herein stands their comfort firme, that God by the hand of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence orders all these things according to the fore-determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the counsel of his will. Neither wil their vain imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation helpe them, that <hi>Christ might haue been slain, and become our sacrifice, yet without sinne.</hi> For howsoeevr it bee not for them, nor me, to determine what was possible to Gods abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power; yet we know, considering the declaration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of both by the Scriptures and event, that in regard of Gods decree, it was necessarie that Christ should dye, as he did, by the conspiracie and rage of wicked men; as both the expresse words, and plain drift of the places proue. Lastly, it is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous presumption, that <hi>God might haue appointed some to haue sacrificed his sonne Christ, as he did Abraham to sacrifice his sonne Isaac,</hi> to wit, <hi>in obedience to Gods commandement,</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how expresly the Scriptures did even before his death, teach the contrary: and that <hi>the sonne of man must suffer many things, and be killed by the Elders and chiefe Priest.</hi> Also that<note place="margin">Mark. 3. 31. Luk. 24. 20.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26. Ioh. 12. 32. 33. Gal. 3. 13.</note> Christ <hi>ought to suffer,</hi> to wit, what he had suffered, by the <hi>Priests and Rulers which had delivered him to bee condemned to death, and had crucified him:</hi> which manner of death, by being <hi>hanged upon the tree,</hi> so <hi>becoming a curse for us,</hi> that he <hi>might free us from the curse of the Law,</hi> was as well foretold by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as his death it selfe. If that cannot but be, which the Scriptures fore-tell, and that the Scriptures fore-told that Christ must thus be killed and crucified by the hands of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, then was it necessary (and could not otherwise be) in regard of Gods decree, that Christ should die as he did, and not without sinne in them that killed him.</p>
               <p>To conclude this place: These men granting, that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the death of his sonne, but denying that he decreed the meanes and manner thereof, make the most wise God like weak man, who often resolues of a thing to bee done, but takes time to consider of the manner of doing it.</p>

                  <hi>David</hi> for his sin? Are not <hi>all Gods judgements good and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous?</hi> Doth the Iudge onely suffer the punishment of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, and not inflict or procure it? The scriptures teach, and these men acknowledge, that <hi>whatsoever is good, commeth from the father of lights:</hi> Are not Gods judgements (wherof this is one) good in truth, though both evill to mans sence, as this was to <hi>Davids;</hi> and worse sometimes in the instruments both intention and action, as it was in <hi>Absoloms?</hi> It is therefore evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the same thing, in divers respects, was both the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible sin of <hi>Absolom,</hi> and the severe punishment of <hi>David,</hi> and the just judgment of God. Take a familiar similitude for the explaining of this matter. The water is of it selfe apt and prone to flow to and fro. The husbandman by h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14749:7"/>
the water, but finding it there, makes use of it for his purpose, and by his skill leads the water whither seems good unto him. So neither did the Lord infuse at all corrupt on into <hi>Absolom,</hi> but finding it there by the Divels and his owne work, ordered it to that his holy end, the glory of his justice in punishing the heynous sins of <hi>David:</hi> of which punishment he was the authour.</p>
               <p>These men grant, that <hi>God foreseeth all evill to come.</hi> This foresight of God they will not deny to bee certain, and that wherein God cannot be deceived. Whereupon it followes, that such evils so foreseen, necessarily and unavoydably come to passe. If any object, that Gods foresight is not the cause of the evill. I answer, no more is his decree or work of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence about it. It sufficeth for the purpose in hand, if it follow by way of event or consequence upon the antecedent, though not of effect upon the cause. Let us yet a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther open this poynt. This knowledge, or fore-knowledge of God, is two-fold: naturall and indefinite, by which God knowes all possible things, and whatsoever in any respect, or upon any supposition, can possibly be: or definit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, by which of things possible he knowes what shall and what shall not be. Now howsoever this fore-knowledge (as all other things in God) be one, and that infinite and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; yet in our conception, the former of those acts of Gods fore-knowledge, goes before the decree, the latter presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it. For therefore God certainly and infallibly forsees a thing shall be, because he unchangeably decrees it shall be in and according to its kind: if good, by his working it: if evill, by his suffering it, and governing the creature in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it.</p>
               <p>But you will answer, that God from eternity certainly and infallibly fore-saw <hi>Absoloms</hi> incest, because <hi>Absolom</hi> would certainly and undoubtedly practise it in time. But I would further know, whence this certainty and undoubtednesse of <hi>Absoloms</hi> such practise should arise, so as it could not possibly but be, nor God be deceived in that his prescience or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14749:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It was not of any absolute necessitie of it self, that <hi>Absolom</hi> should be born: or being born, that he should be preserved, and surviue to that time: or being till then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that he should haue naturall ability, and opportunitie therewith to practise that sin: seeing it was not impossible, but that <hi>David</hi> might haue taken his wiues with him, or they haue fled els whither, and haue hid themselues. In all these things God was not a meere sufferer, but a powerful worker by his providence. But suppose the being of all these things as they were; and withall, <hi>Absoloms</hi> heart by the Divels work, and his owne, fraught with lust, and impiety this way; yet was <hi>Absalom</hi> a changeable creature, haveing in himself free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or libertie of will to haue forborn that act at that time, or to haue exercised his lust upon some other object. How then could that particular event follow unchangeably from his changeable will? How necessarily and inavoydably, from his choyce of will which was free in it self either to that act, or to another of that kinde, or to neither? Either therefore Gods decree from eternitie (and so his work in time) must be acknowledged for the disposing and ordering of all events unavoydably, or his knowledge be denied in foreseeing them infallibly.</p>
               <p>Lastly, to affirme that any thing, great or small, good or evill, comes to passe in the world, without Gods providence ordering and governing it and them that doe it, is to set the creature from under the Creators rule and dominion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and to shut God out of the earth, whilst men doe what they list in it, he letting them alone, and not medling with them.</p>
               <p>How <hi>Adam had power from the creation of God not to sin</hi> which<note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> they urge in the nextplace, we shal shew hereafter. In the mean while, their addition, that <hi>Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding him not to sin, and yet his decreeing that he should sin, are contrary, as light and darknes,</hi> is faulty both in regard of our assertion, and their own. For us, we do not hold, that God decreed <hi>Adams</hi> sin, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14749:8"/>
that is, either to approue it, or command it, or compell unto it, nothing lesse: but this we affirm, that God decreed to leaue <hi>Adam</hi> to himself in the temptation, and not to assist him with that strength of grace, by which he could (if he would) haue upheld him; and so to order both him, and all things about him, in that his temptation, as that, he, by the motion and sway of his own free-will, following his naturall appetite to the pleasant, but forbidden fruit, and that false perswasion wherewith his understanding was by Sathan o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verclouded, should both choose and eat the forbidden fruit. Neither are these two things contrary, that God should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid a thing, and yet decree that it should come to passe in the<note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> manner fore-mentioned.

When a thing comes to passe in this or that manner (though before not so much as insinuated in his Word, and therfore secret) we then know that it was the will of God it should so come to passe, either by his working it according to its kinde, if it be good; or by his suffering and ordering it, and the worker therof, if evill.</p>
               <p>It is true which they adde, that <hi>Gods revealed will, was not</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:14749:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>revealed but hidden, before it was revealed.</hi> But what then? <hi>There was then,</hi> say they, <hi>two hidden wils in God contrary to each other: wherof the one willed; yea, decreed Adam to sinne, and the other willed him not to sin,</hi> and so by consequence, <hi>a good will, and an evill will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, that the will of God in him, and its selfe, is but one, and the same most simple; but by us conceived of, as divers, according to the diversity of objects upon which it is set. Secondly, we doe not say, that God willed <hi>Adams</hi> sin immediately, but that he willed the suffering and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of both the sinne and sinner in sinning.

a little more distinctly consider, how it may and ought to be granted, that God furnished <hi>Adam</hi> with all necessarie and sufficient grace and helps, against sin, and for perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in holinesse.</p>
               <p>First then, we confesse, that God making him a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature, bestowed upon him withall whatsoever grace was sufficient and necessarie, on his part; that is, as much (and more) then he was bound to giue him. Secondly, that God gaue him whatsoever was sufficient for his preservation in that state of holinesse and integritie in which he was created, out of the case of temptation. Thirdly, I grant, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever grace he wanted for the resisting of the temptation, when it came, it was by his own default, and that if hee had not failed himself, the grace of God would and should haue sustained him therein also. Notwithstanding all this, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent manifested, that <hi>Adam</hi> had not the grace to withstand the temptation of the serpent by the woman, but was seduced thereby. It was nothing but want of grace in him not to withstand it: and this grace he could not haue but by his <hi>gift, from whom every good gift, and every perfect giving commeth</hi>

                  <hi>down,</hi> even <hi>the father of lights.</hi> God gaue him will actually one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to good, but changeably; and power to understand and do whatsoever concerned him if he would: But now that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie of will upon clear understanding and unchanged pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of heart, which was requisite in so great a temptation (by so subtile an adversarie in an object so pleasing to nature, and good in it selfe, together with the perswasion of his wife, so neere unto him) this grace, I say, <hi>Adam</hi> received not of God, as the event in the changing of his will upon deceitfull information of his understanding, blinded by an appearing good, made it too manifest; though as before I sayd, through his owne default, in not depending upon God as he ought.</p>

                  <hi>Law to ensnare him;</hi> but that <hi>that law was holy and good;</hi> that <hi>Adam was the son of God by creation; that if men, who are evill, do good unto their children, and would not beget them to misery; how</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:14749:10"/>
                  <hi>much lesse hath the good God created his Sonne to sinne and misery?</hi> As also, that <hi>sinne is the defacing of Gods image in man,</hi> we willingly acknowledge; and withall whatsoever can be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered therefrom.</p>
               <p>We beleeue that the end of <hi>Adams</hi> creation in regard of himselfe was holinesse, and happinesse; in regard of God, the glorious manifestation of his power, wisedom, holinesse and goodnesse; and that sinne came in by accident, and misery by sin; man by his free, but corrupted will, willing the sin; and God by his just and holy will, the punishment; and that sin was in no sense the destinated end of Gods creation; nor misery, but by accident, as to come for sin. Yet must the difference here be held (howsoever these men tumble all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) between God (<hi>Adams,</hi> and all mens father by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and his children) and between naturall parents, and their children. God was <hi>Adams</hi> absolute father, and Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though not for the use of any unjust power; men are but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as it were by borrowing, and with a power limited by Gods will. 2 <hi>God workes,</hi> and orders <hi>all things for himselfe, yea, even the wicked for the evill day,</hi> and <hi>of him, and through</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 4. Rom. 11. 36</note>

Will these free Burgesses, of their own chusing, make a Parliament-law to binde God to doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he possibly can to keep from sinning men and Angels? Lastly, earthly parents would rather (had they before known it) never haue begotten their children, then that they should (though meerly by their own default) haue come to sin and misery therby without remedy. But God (even our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being Iudges) <hi>foreknew</hi> these things of men, and yet crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them notwithstanding.</p>

               <p>Here then in the first place, a distinction must be put, which is, that a thing is unchangeably good, either in, and by it selfe, and so God onely is unchangeable (and so <hi>onely hath immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,</hi>

God then is onely unchangeably good by nature, and of hims<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lfe; yet by his grace and power, it was possible for <hi>Adam</hi> to haue been kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14749:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
good, so as he should not haue sinned, which is the unchangeablenesse in question.</p>
               <p>And this answereth their first reason. To the second also, I answer, that God making <hi>Adam</hi> changeably good by created nature, might (had it seemed so good to his infinite wisedom) haue kept him by grace from possibility of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his righteous Law, in our meaning, notwithstanding tho <hi>annexing of the penalty,</hi> and that to great good purpose; <hi>viz.</hi> both to shew how God hates all transgressing of his Law, against the breach whereof he denounceth such judgement; and also, as a meanes (by his blessing and grace) effectually for the keeping of <hi>Adam</hi> from breaking it: which use also it should haue had, if <hi>Adam</hi> had done his duety in constant obedience, and that God, by his most powerfull grace had so preserved him, that he had not sinned.</p>
               <p>For the third Reason: First I demand, what necessity there was that <hi>God should haue use</hi> (as they speak) <hi>towards men of the attributes of his justice to punish sin, and of his mercy to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it upon repentance?</hi> Would it haue been any diminution of his perfection, and happinesse if he had not so done? Doth not the glory of God also even most brightly shine in the <hi>elect Angels,</hi> which haue been and shall be kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably holy and without sin for ever? and in regard of whom those holy Attributes, of justice in punishing, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in pardoning haue no use. But obserue (good Reader) how these men are taken inavoydably in their own snare. It is not mans being made changeable, and such as might sin, by which their could come to be <hi>use of Gods attributes of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for the punishing of sin; and mercy for the pardoning of it;</hi> except withall man become actually changed, and sinfull. Can there be <hi>use of justice for punishing,</hi> or <hi>of mercy for fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of sin,</hi> but where sin is? Their reason therfore (if it bear weight) proues not onely that man might possibly, but that he must sin necessarily. Which I lay down and apply for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally thus. That without which the Attributes of Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to punish sinne, and of his mercy to pardon it, had been
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14749:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
utterly without use towards men, that must necessarily be: but without mans sinning, the attributes of Gods justice to punish, and of his mercy to pardon, had been utterly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out use towards men: <hi>ergo,</hi> man must necessarily sin, by just consequence upon their antecedent.</p>
               <p>Their reasons thus answered, I will plainly proue that God could, if it had so pleased him, haue kept <hi>Adam</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably good; as the Angels, and soules of men are, and bodies shall be (at the resurrection) unchangeably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.</p>
               <p>And first, the Scriptures teach us to giue this honour to the power of God, as to beleeue, that <hi>our God in the heaven</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 115. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>doth</hi> (and therefore can doe) <hi>whatsoever pleaseth him:</hi> and so could (had it pleased him, and been his will) haue preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Adam</hi> from sinning against him. Of their distinction of <hi>Gods will</hi> we shall speak by and by. If in the mean while they except, that God could not so will; I would know the reason of their such presumption. If they say, there are some things which God cannot doe, as <hi>to lie,</hi> to <hi>deny himselfe,</hi> to make the same thing to be, and not to be, at the same time, and the like, inferring either impotence in the Creatour, or contradiction in the creature. I demand, what had there been herein against the nature either of the Creator, or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if God by his grace, had kept the understanding of <hi>Adam</hi> from being overclowded with errour, or false opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therewith his will and affections in the integrity of obedience? This had not been (as some imagine) to destroy; but to perfect his nature. Hath not God so kept the <hi>elect Angels</hi> without all change from their primitiue purity? Was not the Lord Iesus in his Manhood so kept upon earth? And shall not all the elect be so kept for ever in heaven? These are, were, and shall be unchangeably righteous; and yet were not, nor are, nor shall be <hi>made Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They themselues confesse, that the <hi>devils are unchangeable</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>in evill;</hi> And why then might not both Angels and men be unchangeable in good? that is, so kept by the power of God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14749:12"/>
as they never turn from their goodnes. Or what barre would these men haue put against the power of God, if his will had been so to haue preserved and kept <hi>Adam?</hi> I demand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Apostles, in their time, could possibly preach any thing but the truth, being immediately and infallibly guided by the Holy Ghost? All these instances serue to proue, that it is possible to God, if it please him, so to assist and confirm by his Spirit, a reasonable creature (though of a changeable nature in its selfe) as that in regard of the same divine assistance, it is not possible it should be changed from good to evill, or sin against God. Lastly, if God could not haue so made and ordered <hi>Adam,</hi> as that he could not haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then God did not so much as suffer him to sinne, seeing none can be said properly to suffer a thing to be done, saue he that could hinder it, if he would. It were absurdly said, that I suffer the wind to blow, or sea to swell, though I hinder them not, seeing it is not in my power to hinder them.</p>

               <p>FOr better answering, and understanding of the answer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these things, it must be considered; first, that <hi>the will of God,</hi> though simple, and one in its nature, yet exerciseth it selfe diversly, in regard of divers objects. The first and weakest degree of Gods willing (to speak of God as man is able to conceiu of him) is that by which he wills the permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or suffering of sin, as sin. For if God suffer it, he suffers it willingly, seeing he both takes knowledge of it, and could hinder it by his omnipotent power, if he pleased. The
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14749:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
second degree of Gods willing, is that by which he commands a thing to be done, and approues of it, if it be done. The third and last degree is, that according to which he workes all things by his omnipotent power. And if a man whose will is finite, yet can will things according to those degrees; how much more both possible and easie is it to Gods infinite will, to exercise it selfe more intensly or remisly, according to those degrees? I may be willing, in cases, to suffer that in another which I approue not of: so may I command my servant or child to doe a thing, and approu of it, if it be done, and yet not so will it, as to use all the power that possibly I can, to haue it done. Some things, again, there are that I so will, as that I doe, or am bound to use all my possible skill and power to haue them effected. These things are much more rightly said of God, considering the infinite largenesse of his will, compared with my straitnesse. The same may be said of the Spirit of God which is one (for <hi>there is one Spirit</hi>) whose<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 4.</note> operation yet is divers, and the same sometimes more, and sometimes lesse forcible: as we see in the knowledge of an Apostle, compared with the knowledge of an ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister or Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an; and many other waies.</p>
               <p>And these differences of the will of God in the exercising of itselfe towards the creature, I desire the Reader here care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> to obseru for after use. Their <hi>short definition,</hi> as they unskilfully call it, <hi>of Gods will,</hi> by which <hi>he either wils what man is to doe,</hi> or <hi>what he will doe in himselfe,</hi> is short indeed, as cutting off all that God will doe and doth out of himselfe, and in the creature, as are all his workes <hi>ad extra,</hi> as they are called.</p>
               <p>It remaines, that in the next place, we shew the difference between <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>compulsion;</hi> and <hi>Gods decreeing</hi> in our sense, and his <hi>forcing of things,</hi> (which our Adversaries with great errour confound as the same) and withall, that things may, after a sort, be done necessarily, and freely too. Freely, yea contingently also, in regard of men, and necessarily in regard of Gods work of providence according to his decree.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14749:13"/>
I mention Gods work according to his decree; because to speak properly, Gods decree or will, works not things, but his power according to his will. There is indeed a <hi>necessity</hi> which takes away <hi>freedom</hi> and voluntarinesse from men; but then they rather suffer then doe. For example, the striking or thrusting of a man with such violence, as that he is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereby to stagger or fall: this necessity of compulsion depriues me of all freedom to this bodily motion, so as I stagger or fall unwillingly; but this comes from an externall principle or beginning working violently, and from without me. But this is nothing to that other necessity in regard of God, causing and effecting the good, in and by the creature, according to its kinde; and suffering and ordering the evill person and thing, according to its kind; with which mans freedom may well stand.</p>
               <p>And first, whatsoever God doth, he doth it both most freely, and most necessarily well. So the <hi>elect Angels</hi> doe the<note place="margin">

So did Christ, as man, the will <hi>of his Father</hi> so freely, as none<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 11. Ioh. 4. 34. Act. 20. 28.</note> can doe any thing more; and yet as necessarily, as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for <hi>God</hi> not to sinne. On the contrary, the devils doe evill, both most necessarily (being by these mens own grant, <hi>unchangeably evill</hi>) and yet most willingly, as carryed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto withall their power. Christ saith, <hi>it must needs be that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 7. 1 Cor. 11. 19</note> 
                  <hi>offences come;</hi> and the Apostle, that <hi>there must be heresies in the Church.</hi> If then freedom of will can stand with no manner of necessity, the authours of these <hi>heresies</hi> and <hi>offences</hi> sinne not therin: for all sinnes specially of this kinde are volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I add in the last place, that the better any man, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell is, he doth good the more, both necessarily and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and the worse any, evill, both waies.</p>
               <p>Neither will it seem strange unto us, that one and the same action comes under so divers considerations, as in one regard, to be voluntary, contingent and casuall; and in another, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: if we consider, how divers agents concur and meet together in producing it.

as that God hath not some hand in it, in sustaining and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the person and work, yea in effecting that which is good in it, as all that is, which hath in it any created being or order. What hinders then, but that the same thing may in regard of man as the particular and immediate cause, be voluntary and contingent; and yet in regard of God the highest and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall cause, necessary?

               <p>These things thus cleered, we will come to the exposition of the words of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> so oft and vehemently urged by these men, and others; which are, that <hi>God takes not pleasure</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I answer; first, that the Lord takes no delight in the death of a sinner, that repents, and <hi>turns from his wicked way:</hi> but otherwise, if the sinner repent not, the Lord takes delight in his death; not for the misery of the creature, but for the glory of his justice shining therin.

It pleaseth him for his holy ends, to suffer sin, and to order the creature sinning by his own freewill, &amp; election of evil, as hath been formerly proved. Thirdly, it must be noted that the Prophet speaks there of such sinners onely, as to whom the word comes; saying, <hi>Turn yee, turn yee from your evill waies,</hi>

               <p>WE deny their charge, and answer by distinction; that <hi>Adams</hi> taking and eating the forbidden fruit, <hi>Davids</hi> adultery, <hi>Ioahs</hi> murther, and the like, are to be considered two waies: First, naturally, and as they are motions in nature, performed by mans natural &amp; created faculties and powers of soul and body: secondly, morally, as those motions are misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and abused to wrong objects, by mans blinde mind and corrupt will. In the former respect, &amp; materially, as we speak, they are of God and created nature; in the latter and formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of mans proper corruption. Now the sinne is not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall action of motion, but the pravity and abuse of the action. <hi>The subtilty of our riddle,</hi> they, as if they had <hi>plowed with our heyfer,</hi> find out to be <hi>this,</hi> that in our account <hi>sinne is nothing,</hi> and that <hi>God, though the authour of all things, is not the authour of sin, for sin is nothing;</hi> and so <hi>the thiefe,</hi> and other malefactors, is <hi>punished for nothing by the Iudge:</hi> and the <hi>wicked for nothing in everlasting fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, I demand of these men, whether, if God command something to be done, and men doe it not, they deseru not to be punished for their doing of nothing? Is it not sinne not to doe that wee should doe; and to doe nothing when we should doe something? These witty men could teach <hi>the goats <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We then answer, first, that we call not sin <hi>nothing</hi> negatiuely, but privatiuely, as a want of that which should be; secondly, that sin is not nothing morally, that is not <hi>nothing</hi> against Gods Law, for sin onely is <hi>something</hi> against it, but <hi>nothing</hi> naturally; that is, <hi>nothing</hi> which hath a created being in nature.</p>

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:14749:15"/>So, for their next Argument, that <hi>by authority of Scripture,</hi> &amp; our <hi>own description, sin is a thought, word or deed, contrary to the will of God,</hi> and <hi>therefore</hi> that <hi>the deed is sin;</hi> they should consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that neither the Scriptures nor writers meaning is, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Likewise, when a man or beast halts in going, shall we imagine that the halting is the very motion of going, or the fault of the motion onely?

               <p>First, the Apostle quoting and confirming the saying of the<note place="margin">

Where let it also be noted, that he speakes of the <hi>being, life, and motions</hi> of the very prophane and heathenish Idolaters, as well as of any others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>God,</hi> as it is in the Psalm, <hi>made the heavens and</hi>

                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:14749:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>earth, and sea, and all that in them is.</hi> If sin then be any thing, (viz. any thing having being) God made it, and so it is his creature. And surely if it haue a being, it is either a created or uncreated being. Not the latter, for that is onely God; and therefore the former by their ground. If God created all things that are, sin if it be in their sense, must be Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the same naturall motion of man in which great sin is committed, if it were exercised upon another object, might be without sin, and lawfull; and therefore not the very action or motion, but the misapplying of it, is the sin; from which the action hath its morall, but not its naturall being. For example; the very same naturall motion which <hi>Adam</hi> used in takeing and eating the forbidden fruit, upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruit, had been no sin. The same naturall act in which <hi>David</hi> practised adultery with <hi>Bethsaba,</hi> with his lawfull wife, had been no adultery: the very same naturall act and motion whereby <hi>Ioab</hi> killed <hi>Abner,</hi> and <hi>Amasa,</hi> if exercised upon a malefactor at the magistrates command, had been no murther, but a work of iust execution. The sinne therefore is not in the very act, but in the misapplying it, or other vitious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, considering that there is no sin <hi>in deed</hi> or action of body, which was not first in the faculties of the soule, the understanding, will and affections: (for onely <hi>the things</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>which come from the heart, desile the man</hi>) the outward sin in fact and deed can no more more make the outward action in itselfe not to be of God; then the inward corruption can make the created faculties in which it is, not to be of God. It is sencelesse to doubt but that when a wicked man sleepeth, and so practiseth no wickednesse one way or other, he is notwithstanding a wicked man. And where now resteth his wickednesse, but in his heart? And what is his heart but the faculties of his understanding, will and affections, which sin possesseth and corrupteth? And yet nevertheles these na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall faculties remain Gods good creatures; so do their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14749:16"/>
naturall, notwithstanding sins possessing them. There is in our sinfull nature, the faculty, and the sin or disorder in it: and in our sinfull works, the action from the faculty, and the outward sinne in it, from the inward sinne in the other.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I thus argue unresistably: That which God blesseth is good, and of himselfe: This none will deny. I assume. But God blesseth the natural action, or motion, in which hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible sin is practised. This is most evident (amongst a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand daily instances) in the sinfull commixture of <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Thamar,</hi> being on his part whoredom, and on hers incest,<note place="margin">Gen. 38.</note> though with a better minde: Yet this action (considered na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally) God blessed with a childe; yea, with two sonnes; yea, with him, on whom Christ came according to the flesh, who is blessed for ever. Here is plainly the action blessed, and therfore good (in our sense) and of God; and yet the sin in the action, evill and accursed.</p>

               <p>FIrst, these examples of the Lords <hi>sending the twelue Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Angels,</hi> and of <hi>Sauls comming to Keilah,</hi> and the like, are not to the purpose in hand. The question is (as they themselues put it) <hi>of things coming not of fortune, but by Gods providence,</hi> and <hi>of Gods willing things that come to passe, both good and evill.</hi> To what end then mention they things that never did, nor shall come to passe, either good or evill; And so to cover their craft the better alter the words of the Text, <hi>All Gods workes,</hi> into <hi>All things.</hi> And what are <hi>all these things</hi> with them? <hi>Christs obtaining 12 legions of Angels, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias retaining his possession;</hi> the <hi>saving of the ship in which Paul sayled towards Rome: Sauls coming to Keilah,</hi> and <hi>the destruction of the Ninivits within 40 daies:</hi> which were neither works of God, nor man; nor never were nor shall be. So then by <hi>all Gods works,</hi> as the text saith, and matter in hand requireth; and <hi>by all things</hi> as they say, they must mean plain nothing, and that which never was, nor shall be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Scriptures cited by them, rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; are to them as <hi>Goliahs sword</hi> to him; cleerly cutting off the head of their errour. Take for instance one or two of them, upon which they most insist.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Math.</hi> 26, it was a thing in itselfe possible, considering Gods loue to his Sonne, and his faith in him, that he should haue obtained those Legions of Angels to haue reskued him: So was it also, not onely possible in it selfe, for <hi>Saul,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14749:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in his minde to haue come to <hi>Keilah</hi> &amp;c. And whence then was it, that these things came not so to passe, and had not their answerable events? Even from the decree and providence of Gods ordering things the other way inevitably. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer instance we haue Christs own testimony, who, after men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his such <hi>praying, if he would,</hi> v. 53, adds v. 54, <hi>But then how shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</hi> As if he should haue sayd, it agrees well with the interest which I haue in my Fathers loue, that I should obtain from him an invincible Army of heavenly Souldiers for the reskuing of me out of mine enemies hands: but the Scriptures (manifesting the purpose and decree of God) haue foretold the contrary; and that I should thus be <hi>oppressed, and afflicted, and made an</hi>

                  <hi>offering for sin:</hi> which before he also professed to be <hi>the will of his Father,</hi> v. 39. 42. So for <hi>Sauls coming to Keilah,</hi> it was a thing in it selfe possible, and also <hi>Sauls</hi> purpose, and this the Lord saw, and foretold, but hindred by his providence in sending away <hi>David,</hi> as he had fore-purposed in his counsell to doe, and therby to hinder <hi>Sauls</hi> coming thither. These men should haue said thus, that God, alwaies fore-seeing, and sometimes fore-telling, what in regard of the nature of the things might be, and in respect of the disposition of the persons would be, if they were not prevented; yet doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them effectually by the work of his providence interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, according to the decree of his will. And this, so farre as it looks towards the thing in hand, makes against them, avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a most powerfull work of Gods providence, according to a most constant will, over-ruling all dispositions of persons, and events of things. But for them to say bluntly, as they doe, that <hi>God fore-knows and fore-tels that things will come to passe,</hi> and yet <hi>that those things may be prevented,</hi> is to accuse the Lord himselfe, both of want of wisedom in discerning; and of truth in speaking, and of power in working.</p>
               <p>If any object, that God saith, <hi>Saul will come to Keilah,</hi> I easily answer, that God therin onely fore-tels what was in <hi>Sauls</hi> will and purpose; which compared with the event,

It is ignorantly said, that a thing will be which is promised or threatned conditionally, except it be presupposed that the condition will be first. Alike impious (as accusing God, both of being deceived and deceiving) is that which followeth, that <hi>God knows, and pronounceth, that the wicked shall be damned,</hi> and yet <hi>that there is no necessity of it, but that it may be prevented by repentance.</hi> This is to say, that God knowes, and saies a thing shall be, when it may not be; yea, when he knows it shall not be, as in them that doe repent afterwards.</p>
               <p>If they say further, that wicked men may and shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved if they repent, they say but as the truth is: but if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they conclude of all simply, that therfore they may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repent, or be saved, they erre, not knowing the nature of a conditionall proposition: in which it is sufficient, if the consequence or latter part follow truely upon the antecedent or former part; though it may be, that neither consequent nor antecedent can possibly be.

               <p>Now, can we conceiu it to be for no more but a simple suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, that the Holy Ghost, who knew right well how to speak, should not once, nor twice, but I may safely say, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times in the Scriptures, use words and phrases importing

               <p>Of <hi>Iobs afflictions,</hi> it is also presumptuously said by them, that God <hi>onely suffered</hi> them. <hi>Iob</hi> speaking of his <hi>nakednesse,</hi> and misery, saith expresly, that as <hi>the Lord had given, so the Lord</hi>

Neither is there sense to imagine, that <hi>Iob</hi> so blesseth God for onely letting the divell, and wicked men alone, to work their malice upon him, and his; but as by the eye of faith he saw the hand of God (to be blessed for ever) ordering and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the same to his own holy ends.

               <p>BVT first I would know how they can proue, that though in one place, where no punishment is directly intended, <hi>suffering</hi> and <hi>sending</hi> be all one, therfore they are all one in all other places, where the Lord properly and professedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a punishment? Secondly, I deny, that <hi>sending</hi> and <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> are here all one: but as we find in many other places, so in this, that which one Evangelist relates, though truely, yet not so fully, that another sets down more throughly with all the parts. <hi>Luke</hi> saith, <hi>He suffered them,</hi> and this is true; <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> saith, <hi>He sent them,</hi> and this is the same which <hi>Luke</hi> saith, and more; namely, together with the suffering of them, the directing and determining also of their malice this way, for the Lords most holy, though unknown ends. And if the Lord in this case onely suffered them, and let them alone, then it should follow, that the creature doth some actions, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is wholly left to himselfe without Gods medling with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14749:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him, or ruling of him. But to come neerer the matter, I would know of these men, when two Evangelists or Prophets set down the same thing in divers words, the one in more sparing and strait, and the other in more large termes; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be not to expound the strayter by the larger, and not the larger by the strayter, except there be some apparant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint; The Evangelist <hi>Matthew,</hi> relating the miracle done by Christ upon <hi>Peters mother</hi> saith, <hi>He touched her hand, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 15. Mark. 1. 31</note> 
                  <hi>the fever left her: Marke</hi> saith, <hi>He took her by the hand and the fever left her.</hi> Should we now say, that to take her by the hand, and lift her up, were nothing but to touch her hand? Or say we not truely, that <hi>Mark</hi> said the same thing which <hi>Mathew</hi> doth, and more also: so is it in Christs <hi>suffering</hi> and <hi>sending</hi> the divels. More plainly yet. We reade, how upon the death of <hi>Absolom, Ahimaz the Priest</hi> being very desirous<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22. 23.</note> to be the messenger therof to <hi>David,</hi> importunes <hi>Ioab</hi> greatly <hi>to let him run,</hi> and again to <hi>let him run. Ioab</hi> at the last condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends, and <hi>saith to him run,</hi> and so <hi>v. 29, Ahimaz</hi> expresly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes that <hi>Ioab sent</hi> him to <hi>David.</hi> He therfore both <hi>suffered</hi> him to goe, and <hi>sent</hi> him. He suffered him, as having a desire of himselfe; and sent him also, as his messenger to the King. So Christ both <hi>suffered</hi> the devils, as desiring to possesse the swine rather then to be cast into the deep; and also <hi>sent</hi> them, as ordering their malice to that object, and none other, for the tryall of the <hi>Gergesenes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, followeth to be considered of, the <hi>send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ioseph into Aegypt,</hi> touching which, let these two things onely be added to the things spoken, for the opening of the former instances. First, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> expresly saith, not onely that <hi>God sent him into Aegipt,</hi> but that he <hi>sent him thither to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 45. 5. 7. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>preserue life,</hi> which was Gods end, and not his brethrens, and therfore depends upon Gods work, not upon theirs: but withall, that <hi>it was not they that sent him thither, but God. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> here makes God (in a respect) a greater doer then his brethren: these men shut God quite out, and makes him onely a sufferer, or one that left others alone, and meddles not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14749:22"/>
with them. His brethren <hi>sold</hi> him, but God <hi>sent</hi> him; that is, used their envious injury to his own gracious work, both towards him and them, and much other people, whom by his meanes he kept aliue. Secondly, and for conclusion, let this be observed, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> speaks of <hi>Gods sending</hi> him, to comfort his brethren in their sorrow and fear, for the evill they had done to him. But I would know, what comfort it could be to their perplexed hearts, to think, that God suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to doe wickedly, that is, hindred them not? Can any man having grace, yea common sense, take comfort in this, that God leavs him to himselfe to doe wickedly, and hinders him not? A miserable comforter would this misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exposition haue made <hi>Ioseph</hi> to haue been. Whereas by the other and true sense, though their sin were nothing the lesse, yet Gods providence appeares the greater, and more gracious, in ordering their envy and malice to such an event as it had, whence no small comfort did accrew unto them.</p>

               <p>FIrst, the Scripture by them cited for their catholike cure, is violently stretched aboue it reach. For, neither are all in the world, no nor a handfull (in comparison of the rest) <hi>laden,</hi> as Christ there speaks; that is, feeling and groaning under the intollerable burthen of sin, and of the wrath of God due therunto. This did very few of the other Iews, and fewer of the Pharises, who <hi>thought themselues righteous:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth Christ so call (and therefore not offer to cure) by the preaching of the Gospell, every particular person in the world, from the beginning to the end therof. This truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and shamelesse assertion we shall haue occasion hereafter to confute at large. In the mean while, the place alledged proues onely thus much, that Christ, the good Phisition of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to cure all that come to him, by the preaching of the Gospell, with feeling of their sins, and faith in his death, and no more.</p>
               <p>Secondly, even for them that come to Christ, and are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually healed by him; these men erre (not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God for the conversion of sinners) in affirming that he doth no more but provide the medicine of grace, and outwardly perswade to the receiving of it: or that there is (which they take wrongfully for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) the same natural power in a wicked man to receiv grace offered by the Gospel, that there is in a sick man to take the medicine offered him by the Phisition.

               </p>
               <p>The substance of their objection is, that God will not, and therefore cannot cure men otherwise then by their recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And so oft as these men (as they doe it very often) doe urge <hi>the will of God, that men should beleeve, repent, and be saved,</hi> so oft the Reader must call to mind this distinction. First, that this will of God extends but to such persons, as to whom the Gospell (the onely means of inviting men) is preached. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that towards those that do effectually beleeve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, there is also a further degree of Gods good will and pleasure, according to which he reveales unto them effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 25 Act. 16. 14 Act. 13. 18 2.

               <p>Their <hi>spiritual sense</hi> also of the parable I acknowledge. But whereas <hi>Ereunetes sees, that Election consists in the wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and righteousnesse of Christ, which is Christ himself, whom the faithfull do put on by faith and obedience:</hi> He sees that which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14749:27"/>
is not to bee seen, and sees not that which is plain enough. Who having common sense, will say, that <hi>Christ and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse;</hi> and the chusing of a man, or his <hi>election,</hi> are all one? Christ is not our <hi>election,</hi> but he <hi>in whom we are chosen,</hi> or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Neither is our <hi>putting on of Christ by faith and obedience,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>our election;</hi> as they unskilfully make it. Election is Gods work, not ours; for it is God that clruseth us, and not we our selues: but the putting on of Christ by faith and obedience, is our work by Gods grace, and not Gods. God doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and obey, but we by his grace.</p>
               <p>Now before we come to refute their opinion about <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> hereafter layd down more plainly, but here more confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly, with certain scriptures, rather heaped together then orderly brought for their purpose; it is expedient we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine a distinction brought by them of this divine <hi>Election,</hi> by occasion of an objection from Ephes. 1. 4. which is, that <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is either in the decree or purpose of God</hi> onely; <hi>or else effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 42. 43</note> 
                  <hi>and particularly</hi> made, as they speak. This distinct on in a good sense (but not in theirs) is good and true. For God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects men before the world, or before they be, in his decree and purpose onely. But it must withall be considered, that this election is also (in Gods purpose) actuall and particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world. Nothing in God is potentiall, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t all actuall. Otherwise there should be imperfection in God, as all poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials are, being to be perfected by their actualities. They should therefore say, that Gods election of some particulars, was onely in his decree before the world, and is by him in time brought into actuall execution. And here also it must be minded, that whereas all the question (in effect) amongst all, is about <hi>election</hi> as <hi>before the world,</hi> and in Gods eternall decree: they (in effect) passe that wholly by, and onely treat of it, as God in time puts that in decree in actuall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
               <p>Now though their <hi>reasoning of election</hi> here be full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and contradiction, as any judicious Reader may see, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

yet this is plain, that they will haue it to <hi>depend upon the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith and repentance</hi> going before, affirming expresly, that <hi>those persons in whom God findeth faith and obedience, them he ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth to salvation in his son, of meer mercie, for the quality which he findeth in them.</hi> But now wherein this election properly stands, they neither shew us, nor understand themselues, as is plain by their crosse and unconstant assertions of and about it; wherein yet they are so peremptory and bold, as if they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all by plain demonstration of undoubted truth. What course then are we to hold with them? Considering it is with them as <hi>Salomon</hi> speaks of the harlot, who was <hi>lowd and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> whose <hi>feet aboad not in the house,</hi> but <hi>she was now without,</hi>

               <p>First then for Math. 22. <hi>Many are called, but few chosen,</hi> It must be noted, that there are three degrees of mens calling to Christ. The first, when the Gospel is preached, but the so called <hi>refuse</hi> wholly to answer &amp; come: so were the first <hi>guests</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Vers. 11.</note> The third is, when men come in true faith and obedience, as they ought; and so the rest of the guests came. Of this third and last degree of calling the Apostle speakes, saying, <hi>Whom</hi>

               <p>And for the <hi>Election</hi> here spoken of, it may well be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the eternall election in Gods decree; the fruits and wholsome effects whereof this unprepared guest shews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not to be made partaker of, though he participated of the outward calling, even to the making of some shew of that which in truth he wanted. And as the Apostle affirms of the<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 3. 4. 5. 13.</note> Ephesians, that they were <hi>elect of God in Christ before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>

               <p>Or take the words as meant of the actual execution of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that in the largest sense, so as in the same be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded whatsoever God doth in time, for the effectual procuring of a mans salvation; as of the giving of Christ for him, of the Gospell to him, and by it faith and holinesse, and the spirit of adoption; and so glory in the end: and we say, all this he doth according to his eternall purpose of election, effectuall onely in those who are made partakers of the inward calling, and wedding garment thereby, and not in all that are called out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.

                  <hi>him.</hi> This is meant (our adversaries granting it) of the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of election:</hi> the meaning therefore must needs be, that God hath from eternity decreed to elect or chuse us in time actually, not because we should or would be holy, as these men perversly imagine, but <hi>that we might be holy.</hi> As God from eternity purposed to chuse men, so hee chuseth them actually in time: But he purposed from eternity to chuse men that they might be holy, and therfore actually in time chuseth them, that they might be holy, and unblameable before him; and therfore not because they are holy, or beleev and obey. Gods actuall chusing therfore goes before our actuall faith, holinesse, repentance, and obedience, as the cause; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them not, as an effect, as they mis-judge.

                  <hi>the adoption of children by Iesus Christ:</hi> With which joyne that, Rom. 8. 30, <hi>Whom he predestinated, them also he called, and whom he called, them also he justified, and whom he justified, them also he glorified.</hi> To be elected, to wit, in decree, and to be predestinated (in the good part, as here) are the same in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: onely, we are said to be predestinated in respect of the supernaturall ends, (and means leading therunto) unto which God in time bringeth us; and to be elect, or chosen in respect of others, from whom God selecteth us. Now, if we be predestinated of Christ to the adoption of children, then not because we are children or beleev, which are the same, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12.

                  <hi>dwell in thy courts; we shalbe satisfied with the goodnesse of thy house, of thy holy Temple</hi> Faith then and holinesse are not the fore found conditions for which God chuseth a man: but the actuall conferring and giving of them, according to an eternall purpose, is the very actuall chusing of him: even that by which God severs, elects, selects, and chuseth him out of the masse of the wicked. Every mans common sense will teach this. All are of themselues, and by nature, sinners, and subject to wrath. Now what is it for God actually to chuse some from the rest, but to bestow that upon them actually and effectually, by which they differ actually from the rest, which is faith and repentance. God doth not therfore (as these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries imagine) <hi>chuse, upon condition of faith and repentance going before:</hi> but doth, by the very bestowing of these graces of faith and repentance, which others want, chuse, elect, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and sever actually from others, the elected from eternity in his decree.</p>
               <p>Lastly, by the crosse doctrine of these men, we should chuse God, before God chuse us; for by beleeving and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we chuse God to be our God; and for this (by their crooked rule) God after chuseth us to be his people.

But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider we this choise in proportion to the other, and see what followeth.

So Gods actuall chusing of a man to the Kingdom of heaven, is that by which he hath first actuall right to that Kingdom, to which he had no right before, saue in Gods decree. Gods chusing a man therfore actually (as they speak) to the Kingdom of heaven, is the very giving of him faith and holinesse; for by these he hath this actuall right to eternall life and glory. If therfore Gods chusing men actually (opposed to his chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them in decree) be his giving them actuall faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, then their faith and repentance goes not before Gods choise, but on the contrary, his chusing before their beleeving.

what he had formerly decreed. They should therfore haue learnt in this place, from their more learned Masters, to haue added the condition of their persevering to the end, without which it is certain, none shall be saved. But then they must needs rush upon the same deperate rock, with the other; which is, that none are thus actually and particularly elect or chosen, till they be dead, seeing they deny all certainty of perseverance, to the living; not acknowledging any thus elect, either before the world, or in it, but after the world, and in heaven.</p>

               <p>First, we know, that all by nature, and of themselvs, are subject to sin, and condemnation, and so might in justice haue been left of God, without remedy of redemption. If then it had been but just with God to haue left all in that state of sin and misery, into which they haue cast themselvs, it is then meere mercy, that he hath chosen any in his Son, or given him for any. Now if of all men, indefinitely considered as faln. God haue purposed in himself from eternity, to raise up some, by working effectually in them faith and obedience, so to saue them; and not to work the same in others, but to leav them to their own affected and effected pravity, and sin, and so in justice to condemn them for that their wickedness by them freely committed, and obstinately continued in; I would know, in regard of whether of these two works we can be said to make God, <hi>a respecter of persons?</hi> The one being a pure work of his mercy, and the other of his justice. Why God should thus chuse some, and passe by others, in the generall, we see reason, both by the light of nature, and the Scriptures; namely, that the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>power,</hi> and justice <hi>might be seen</hi>

               <p>The Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2.

               <p>The last place being 2. Chron. 36. 16. is impertinent, as neither meant of Christs death (of which the question is) nor of mans salvation by it; but of a bodily and visible judgement: in which kind of works God tieth himself to no certain form of proceeding.</p>
               <p>Against their error of universall redemption by Christs death, I thus argue: <hi>Them whom</hi> God and <hi>Christ love</hi> (to wit,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13, 1.</note> with that speciall loue of mercy) they <hi>love unto the end;</hi> and<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16.</note> therefore never come to hate them as they do the wicked and damned.

                  <hi>Sonne,</hi> and he <hi>in giving himselfe to the death</hi> for them, love with the most speciall love of mercy that can be: Therefore they for whom Christ died, never perish, but in time haue wrought in them faith and repentance, and are kept in the same, by the power of God to life. Christ therefore dyed effectually, and in his, and his fathers intention of love, for them onely that are saved, and perish not. This is also more manifest Ioh. 17. whence may be drawn many arguments to prove that all for whom Christ died, are saved, seeing <hi>all that are given to Christ of the Father, keep the word of God, and haue eternall life gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them by him,</hi> Now it cannot be denyed, but that all for whom Christ dyed, are given him of the Father, that he might redeem and save them by his death. Furthermore, the death and bloodshed of Christ is every where called the <hi>price of our redemption,</hi> and <hi>a ransome for sinners.</hi> Vpon this holy foundation most clearly layd in the Scriptures, these men, and<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 Tim. 2. 6.

Secondly it impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth Gods power, and makes him unable, doe he what he can, to save any more then he doth save, though he desire it never so much. For look, for whom he would do the greatest thing that possibly he could, which was the giving of his onely begotten and beloved Sonne to the cursed death of the crosse, for them and their salvation (without all doubt) hee he will doe whatseever other good (as lesse) that possibly he can.

               <p>I Answer, that the persons of whom those Scriptures speak, were the peculiar people of God, and not yet wholly cast off by him. The argument therefore from Gods will and work for the saving of them, is stretched beyond its reach, to prove such purpose, will or work of God to save all which are not his people, as they were. Secondly, I grant, that where the Gospell is preached, there the Lord truely wills, that is, commands the conversion of sinners, and their <hi>turning from iniquity,</hi> as the text hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now the Apostles not knowing which in particular were elect, and redeemed in the secret purpose of God, and Christ, were to sow the seed of grace upon all grounds, and to preach to all indifferently, as they had occasion; hoping in charity that this, and that, and any one particular, might be of the elect ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and good ground in Gods destination: by whose <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

And in this I haue been something the longer, because being well noted and applyed, it may serve for answer to all the Scriptures brought by them for the establishing of their universall grace ftom the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospell, though it were as universall as they erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neously make it.</p>

The drift of the parable is not to shew that all and each person in the world are called, but that few of them that are called, doe rightly obey. Neither sayth Christ, that <hi>all</hi> are <hi>called,</hi> but <hi>many.</hi> I add, that this place by rebound utterly overthrowes them: as shewing plainly, that the Gentiles (as the latter guests) were not called, till the Iews (the first guests) refused to come. Many thousands therefore of them in former ages, lived and died being uncalled by the Gospell. The places, Math. 28. and Mark. 16. speak also of the time after Christs ascension, and not before, and so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw an universall calling of all, at all times: <hi>God shewed his word to Iakob; but dealt not so with any other nation.</hi> Besides, their<note place="margin">Psa. 147. 19 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and occasion. By that Rom. 10. 18. the Apostle means not, that the Gospell was preached in all ages to every person in the world. He quotes Psal. 19. which speakes apparently of the creatures preaching, specially <hi>the heavens and firmament,</hi> which the Holy Ghost here applieth to the Apostles preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their age, either by way of argument, or allusion.

               </p>
               <p>To the other places brought, the former answers suffice. Where it is sayd, <hi>the Gospel is now preached to all nations,</hi> and <hi>through the whole world,</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>to every creature,</hi> and the like, first, the note of distinction <hi>now,</hi> is to be minded, intimating, that before <hi>now</hi> the Gospel was not preached to nations, but to that one nation of the Iewes onely. Secondly we are not to imagine, that by <hi>all nations,</hi> and the like, is meant eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular nation without exception, much lesse, every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular person in every nation, but to take the words as inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely spoken (as opposed to the preaching to that one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) as there was occasion for the Apostles or other reachers to come unto them. Where it is sayd, Act. 2. 5. that <hi>there were dwelling in Ierusalem devout men out of every nation under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> shall we imagine that there must needs be <hi>English</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,</hi> and <hi>Iappanians</hi> there?

                  <hi>who haue a conscience to excuse them, if they doe the things of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. This form of speech, used by the Apostle of the Law, as written in mens hearts, is borrowed from Gods wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Law in tables of stone, which had first, and by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, been written in mens hearts, out of which it was almost quite blotted by sin. Now what is it for <hi>the Gentiles,</hi> to haue <hi>had the Law written in their hearts, in or by nature,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaks? This must needs be in nature created: for in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as corrupted, there is no writing in, but blotting out of

the Law. If by nature created, then as infants haue this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so haue they this naturall manuscript, or writing of Gods hand. This also the very word <hi>nature</hi> imports, signifying that which is born with a man, or with which hee is born; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of a word in Greek that signifies to beget, or produce, as parents doe children, and each living creature its kind: And seeing the Apostle here speaks of a <hi>Law</hi> by which men discern the differences between right and wrong; good and evill; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and dishonest, in morall and main matters; whence, and with what hand, should all, and every man and woman living in the world, even there where is no Law otherwise written or preached, haue this law and conscience thus written in their breasts, saue by the finger of God in creation? This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and conscience being the remainders of that image of God, in which all men, in <hi>Adam</hi> were made. By all which it appears evidently, that infants bring into the world with them this law of nature, and those foot-steps of Gods image in their reasonable soules; who having in them the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of understanding and will, cannot possible be devoyd of all law for the ordering of the same; to wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Having thus shewed that these men either fight busily with their own shadows, in proving at large things never called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to question by us; or may easily haue their weapons turned upon themselvs, in the main matter: I will even now proceed, after that I haue briefly observed some particular mistakings by them. And first, they both add to the Text, and err in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that which is written, Rom. 11. 32. The Scripture is, <hi>God hath concluded them all in unbeliefe, that he might haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie upon all,</hi> they add, of their own, <hi>every person:</hi> whereas the Apostle neither speaks of every person; but onely of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14749:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Gentiles indefinitely at one time, and of the Iews at another, which he there opposeth the one to the other: neither speaks he of the offering of grace and mercy onely, as they deem; but of the actuall conferring of it upon all, of whom there he speaks, who <hi>beleeved</hi> and <hi>obtained mercy;</hi> the other remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>in unbeleef.</hi> And this, both the drift and words of the place expresly manifest, v. 30. 31. 32. Neither doth that other place alledged, Tit. 2. 11, speak of all, and every particular person, but of persons of all sorts, <hi>servants</hi> as well as <hi>masters,</hi> or any others. The Apostle v. 9, &amp; 10, provokes beleeving servants to <hi>obedience to their masters;</hi> rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They deal craftily in bearing the Reader in hand, that <hi>the disputation of Paul</hi> herein is <hi>hard,</hi> and the matter <hi>darkly handled,</hi> that so they may turn the thoughts of the Reader from it; or at least dim them with prejudice against that plain and evident truth of Gods free election, and reprobation joyned therewith; Both which things he sets down most clearly (though the reason of the Lords different dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, that are in themselves alike, he makes unsearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and determines in the free purpose of his will) if men did not trouble the pure and cleare water of Gods sanctuary with the foul feet of their corrupt glosse. They also erre in make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>this one of the places in Pauls Epistles, of which the Apostle Peter speaketh,</hi> 2.

               <p>AS the proper and particular scope of divers parts of this Epistle, is divers; so do they misse of the drift of this particular chapter, which is not (as they conceive) to <hi>prove ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification not to be by the workes of the Law, but by the faith of Christ in the Gospell:</hi> But to shew that the first and highest cause, why, of all mankinde faln in <hi>Adam,</hi> one is cleared, and another not, is onely the good pleasure, and free wil of God, and not mans deservings: and yet that God in so choosing, or
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14749:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
electing one before another, doth nothing unjustly, as shall appeare in the particulars hereafter to bee explained: and may in the mean while be gathered by these three generall reasons.</p>
               <p>First, for the Apostle, when of purpose he handles the matter of <hi>justification by faith, chap.</hi> 3. &amp; 4. doth so oft and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine iterate and inculcate the terms of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> almost in every verse whereas here, he never so much as once mentions either of them in the disputation it selfe. which is to the end of vers. 24. where he descends from the matter of election to the calling of the elected, both of Iewes and Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is unreasonable to conceive, that the Apostle, having in the third and fourth chapter so fully handled, and so expresly concluded that matter of <hi>Iustification by faith, and not by works;</hi> and chap. 7. the effect and end thereof, <hi>Peace with God,</hi> and perseverance to salvation; and chap. 6. the matter of sanctification; and chap. 7. the imperfection of that sanctification in this life; and chap. 8. the afflictions of the faithfull, and their perseverance notwithstanding to the death; should now again without any occasion, and against all order, return to the same matter of justification, so fully handled and ended before. This might wel agree with these mens wandrings in this their treatise, but agrees not with the wisdom either divine or humane wherewith the Apostle was furnished. Much more absurd is it to imagine, that having formerly handled that subject matter of justification so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he hath done, chap. 3, and 4. he should returne to handle the same matter so darkly and obscurely, as all the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the truth, and fautors of this conceit, are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to confesse he hath done in this place.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if this were the Apostles proper drift, what nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he to have made such deep protestation of his hearty sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the Iewes as he did, more in this place then in the former, where he handled that matter more clearly then here? It was in truth no other thing that moved the man of God
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14749:44"/>
to these sad and sorrowfull protestations, then to remov the offence which might be taken at the Iews rejection, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Gentiles in their stead; of which, and the highest cause thereof, hee was now to speak in the 9. 10. and 11. chapters.</p>
               <p>Lastly, we shall (God willing) make it appear in sundry particulars, that these Adversaries, by wresting of some things, and omitting of others, <hi>pervert the Apostles words</hi> to a strange sense, how soever they think to get advantage by striking others first with that imputation.</p>
               <p>And first, though they account it <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>without difficulty,</hi> that the Apostles meaning v. 5, &amp; 6, is, that <hi>not all the Israelits, not all the children of Abrahams flesh specially, not such as boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of the observation of the Law, were therefore in the state of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or should be saved:</hi> yet in truth, he plainly means ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Pag. 60.</note> thing; namely, that <hi>all Israel, all that were the seed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>children of the flesh,</hi> were not that <hi>Israel,</hi> that <hi>seed,</hi> those <hi>children</hi> to whom <hi>the promise was made:</hi> that is, were not they touching whom God by his <hi>promise</hi> declared his <hi>purpose of election</hi> mentioned, v. 11. For though all are saved that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv the promise by faith, and none by the works of the Law, yet the Apostle in this place, neither speaks a word of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as the effect of the promise) but of <hi>election</hi> (as the cause therof:) nor yet of mens receiving the promise by faith; but of Gods making it, <hi>according to election;</hi> that so <hi>the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of God,</hi> and promise manifesting it, <hi>might stand accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to election,</hi> v. 11, that <hi>the word of God might take effect,</hi> v. 6. even <hi>the word of promise; At this time will I come</hi> &amp;c. v. 9, they are then called <hi>children of the promise,</hi> not because they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but because the <hi>promise (Sara shall haue a Son,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>was made</hi> unto them, <hi>according to the election of grace,</hi> and <hi>stableness of Gods purpose,</hi> v. 8. 9. 11, which promise also, they did in time, receiv by faith, according to the election of that rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from the rest, the promise following the purpose of election; and faith, and salvation by it following the purpose and promise. Though <hi>Israel,</hi> that is, <hi>all which were of Israel,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:14749:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>obtained not that which he seeketh for, yet the election hath obtained</hi> it; even <hi>the remnant of Israel,</hi> to whom <hi>Gods promise is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 11. 5. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>to the election of grace:</hi> in regard of which remnant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to election, the word of God is effectuall, and the promise fulfilled touching <hi>the yonger son of Rebeca: of</hi> whose two sonns, <hi>it was said before they were born, or had done either good or evill, the elder shall serv the yonger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as they truely affirm, that <hi>neither birth nor works did prefer with God:</hi> so I demand here, what those works were, by which <hi>Esau</hi> sought for justification? The Scriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 16. Gen. 25. 32. 33, &amp;c.</note> term him a <hi>prophane person;</hi> that is, a despiser of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; yea, of his very <hi>birth-right,</hi> which was a speciall legall priviledg: How then sought he to be preferred with God, and justified for <hi>birth</hi> or <hi>works?</hi> Or how doth this example of <hi>Esau</hi> fit their imagined <hi>plain</hi> exposition? specially to proue that <hi>the children of Abrahams flesh were not in the salvation, who so much boasted of being Moses disciples in the observation of the Law:</hi> when as the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was not yet given, nor the Law-giver born.</p>
               <p>Their words following, that <hi>God purposeth to prefer those that seek it by his free election, through faith in Christ,</hi> are true in themselvs, but not in their sense. Their meaning is, that God purposed to saue them effectually that should beleev in Christ Iesus: whereupon should be meant in this place onely, such a <hi>purpose of God</hi> as was no more towards <hi>Iakob</hi> then towards <hi>Esau:</hi> for God, by their doctrine, purposed to chuse <hi>Esau</hi> if he beleeved; and not <hi>Iakob</hi> but upon his beleeving first. But the Apostle speaks more then evidently of such a <hi>purpose of God,</hi> as was towards <hi>Iakob</hi> particularly and alone, excluding <hi>Esau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides the <hi>standing</hi> of this <hi>purpose,</hi> and <hi>election,</hi> are here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as two distinct things; of which, <hi>election</hi> is the former, and that <hi>according</hi> to which this <hi>purpose of God stands:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they make them one and the same, accounting <hi>election</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>purpose</hi> of bestowing salvation upon them that beleev.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:14749:45"/>Thirdly, the Apostle cannot mean such a purpose and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as presupposeth faith in Christ, (which they would haue) seeing he expresly affirms it to haue been <hi>when the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had done neither good nor evill.</hi> Is to <hi>beleev in Christ,</hi> to <hi>pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Lastly, he saith not, <hi>that the purpose of God, according to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might stand, not of vvorks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of faith,</hi> as they say: but <hi>not of vvorks, but of him that calleth;</hi> that is, as followeth, that <hi>vvill haue mercy on whom he vvill haue mercy.</hi> By which it is<note place="margin">Vers. 15.</note> plain, that <hi>Paul</hi> doth not in this chapter (as chap. 3. and 4, and Gal. 4,) oppose works and faith; but <hi>vvorks,</hi> and Gods <hi>calling:</hi> He should haue said for their purpose; that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of God stands not of works but of faith, or of him that beleeveth: and not, as hee doth for the purpose of the Holy Ghost, <hi>of him that calleth:</hi> Shewing thereby his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be in this whole discourse, that the <hi>obtaining of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi> or <hi>standing of Gods purpose</hi> in its actuall effect, depends upon God alone, according to three degrees here expressed: first, his gracious <hi>purpose of election</hi> in himselfe towards some: secondly, his <hi>free promise</hi> manifesting his <hi>purpose:</hi> thirdly, his effectuall <hi>calling,</hi> in which <hi>his vvord of promise hath effect,</hi> and his <hi>purpose stands</hi> firm and undisappointed, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unbeleif of the body of <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed.</p>
               <p>Their making <hi>Iakob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> types as they doe, is like the rest, or worse. The Scriptures are not to be drawn from their natural &amp; simple sense, without apparant warrant. It is the high way to heresie, to be bold in framing typical expositions. And with what spirit these men are led this way, appears by their expounding the parable, Luk. 15, making <hi>the Iews the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

                  <hi>of God:</hi> wheras the plain meaning of Christ is, onely to avow his preaching to the Publicans and sinners resorting unto him, against the pride and envy of the Pharisies; those Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and sinners being Iews as well as the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I demand, what it was, in which <hi>Iakob typed out beleevers, seeking righteousnesse by God?</hi> and in which <hi>Esau ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out workers, seeking justification by their own works?</hi> The contrary in <hi>Esau</hi> is expressed in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Lastly, seeing it cannot be denyed, but that <hi>Iakob</hi> as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and godly man was in time actually beloved of God, and <hi>Esau,</hi> as godlesse and prophane, actually hated; it must needs follow, that God before the world was, purposed in himself accordingly, to loue the one and hate the other: seeing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever God in time doth, by way of emanation or application to, and upon the creature, that he purposed to do, as he doth it, from eternity.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Apostle,</hi> v. 13, <hi>Iakob haue I loved, and Esau haue I hated, confirm his former doctrine,</hi> as they say, then he confirms<note place="margin">Pag. 64. 65</note> the doctrine of Gods eternall and stedfast election from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And their boldnesse is excessiue in calling them <hi>perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the words of Paul, which will haue this to be before Iakob and Esau were born:</hi> seeing the Apostle adds this Scripture out of <hi>Malachy,</hi> to shew the reason of that contained in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which both <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> with him, expresly affirm to haue been <hi>before the children were born:</hi> namely, that the<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vers. 11.</note> highest cause of the <hi>elder,</hi> (to wit, <hi>Esau</hi>) his serving the <hi>yonger,</hi> (to wit, <hi>Iakob</hi>) was Gods <hi>loue</hi> to <hi>Iakob,</hi> and <hi>hatred</hi> of <hi>Esau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That following is partly true, namely, that <hi>v. 12. &amp; 13, is not shewed for what cause God loved Iakob and hated Esau:</hi> for that is shewed so far as God would haue us see, v. 15. 18. But fals, where they say, that <hi>they shew not when this was.</hi> For this <hi>loue</hi> and <hi>hatred</hi> was (and before) when God said, <hi>The elder shall serv the yonger:</hi> and this he said, <hi>when the children were not yet born:</hi> the effect of which was, that <hi>the purpose of God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to election might stand</hi> in after time, and that both in respect of the two persons themselvs, and of the bodies of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

to come of them, though not of every particular. And so indeed they are to be considered both as instances in their persons, and heads of their Nations; the Scriptures accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly every where testifying, that God loved, and chose from the rest, the Israelits in their fathers <hi>Abraham, Isaak,</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob,</hi>

               <p>That which they adde in the last place of <hi>Gods not hating</hi> (to wit actually) <hi>and destroying without desert,</hi> is most true.

               <p>Vers. 14, upon the premises, that God of two alike in themselvs, and without respect of good or evill, in the one, or other, had loved the one, and hated the other, an objection is framed, that by this, <hi>injustice</hi> might seem to be <hi>with God:</hi> which the Apostle denyes, with <hi>God forbid.</hi> This objection our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries<note place="margin">Pag. 65.</note> understand to be <hi>upon Gods rejecting the fleshly Israelites, for contemning their salvation offered them by faith in Christ, as Esau was rejected for contemning his birth-right.</hi> But herein (as children skip, where they cannot reade) they leav out the principall part of the objection, which is not onely moved upon Gods rejecting some, but withall upon his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of others. The Apostle in the words before going (which occasion the objection) mentions not onely <hi>Esau the</hi>

Now whether they have omitted this part of the objection in cunning or inconsideratenesse, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves best know. This is certain, that the adjoyning it, qutie overturns their exposition. For comparing together two such persons, as whereof the one glories in his own righteousnesse, as perfectly answering to the holinesse and righteousnesse of the Law; justifying himselfe, when the Law condemnes him; despising the grace and mercy of God in Christ offered, and <hi>making him a lyar in not receiving the testimony which he gives of</hi>

And if any should be so senselesse, as to object injustice to God in such a case (as they conceive the objecter to be) yet was not the Apostle so witlesse, as to fly for answer to the absolute will of God, and to plead, that <hi>God will</hi> doe so, because he <hi>will</hi> or pleaseth to doe it, as v. 15. 18. <hi>I will haue mercie on whom I will have mercie, &amp;c.</hi> Which answer of the Apostle also ministers matter of further and more difficult objection, as appeares v. 19. 20. Whereas if the objection had been cast in their mould, a child could have answered it and sayd, that it had been a most just and equall thing for God to have received and loved the one rather then the other; considering how the one honored the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14749:47"/>
justice, truth, and mercy of God; which the other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored and despised. They erre therefore in applying to this purpose Rom. 2. 4. 5. Neither doth the Apostle there speak of a <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>bounty,</hi> to be shewed to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and repent, as they conceive; but of that which goes before <hi>repentance,</hi> as a means to <hi>lead</hi> unto it: But here he speaks of a higher work of Gods shewing mercy; namely, <hi>the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of his will according to election</hi> to <hi>glory;</hi> and the means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>And truely, these mens boldnesse is too great in putting, for, <hi>God hath mercy on whom he wil have mercy; God hath mercie on them that seek him by the means that he himselfe appoynts.</hi> For though it be most true, that God hath mercie on such; yet the Apostle here speaks no more of Gods appoynting or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>will</hi> for his shewing of mercy, then of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynting or commanding <hi>vvill</hi> for his hardening, v 18, <hi>whom he will he hardens.</hi> He speaks of that will, according to which he himselfe works in loue or hatred: not of that according to which he commands and appoints men to worke. These men in truth confound all things, setting mans will where<note place="margin">Pag. 67.</note> Gods should stand. God saith, <hi>on whom I will:</hi> they say, on him that himselfe wils, or <hi>seeketh as he ought,</hi> &amp;c. The same Idol of mans wil they advance &amp; set up, v. 16, where in stead, of <hi>Gods shewing mercy;</hi> they put, <hi>mans beleeving mercy.</hi> The Lord by <hi>willing, and running,</hi> v. 16, excludes whatsoever is of, or in man, and either within, or without him: and draws all to himselfe alone. In the stead of God <hi>shewing mercy,</hi> they put themselvs, and their free-<hi>will receiving mercy by God offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> as the proper cause of difference between man, and man.</p>
               <p>The 17 vers. <hi>For the Scripture saith unto Pharaoh,</hi> &amp;c, they handle very sleightly: saying something (such as it is) about Gods <hi>hardening Pharoahs heart;</hi> but not medling at all with the place, according to the coherence which it hath with the words going before: unto which, yet the Holy Ghost strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tyeth them, in saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>And let it be diligently minded, that the Apostle here op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth Gods <hi>shewing mercy</hi> to some, and his <hi>hardening</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and not his shewing mercy to some, and his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of others.

This decree of God we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider according to two objects, <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Condemnation:</hi> For sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we say, that God decrees to suffer the sin, which he could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by his almighty power, if he would, and to order both sin and sinner, both before he sin, and in sinning, and having sinned, to his own holy ends. For damnation, we hold, that God decrees it towards none, but for their sin, by him infallibly foreseen, and by them freely to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and continued in without repentance. For though God be moved onely from within himselfe, and the loue of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, to decree the condemnation of a sinner; yet doth lie not so decree to condemn him, but for sin, as the deserving cause, foreseen, and by him to be practised. Neither yet doe either of these decrees passe forth from God for themselvs, but both the one, and the other for the glory of his power and justice to be made known to men and Angels, v. 22.

It is his revealed will which requires it; but his secret and unknown will to giue it, till he make it known by giving it.

               <p>To open this a little further. It was the revealed, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding will of God, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> should <hi>let Israel goe:</hi> but so it was not his secret, or working will; that is, God did not so will this, as that he would use his omnipotent power, and doe what he could to bring it to passe.

                  </note> that he should <hi>offer him up for a burnt offering,</hi> as is plain, in that he commanded him so to doe, v. 1. 2; yet withall, it was Gods secret will, that he should not offer him, <hi>nor lay his hand upon him, nor doe any thing unto him;</hi> as he also revealed unto him in due time, but purposed in himselfe before: <hi>God being without variablenesse, or shadow of turning,</hi> and not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> to haue changed his mind, as vain man doth; yet were
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14749:50"/>
not these two wils contrary one to another, but divers, not in God, in whom all things are one (even one God) but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of divers objects and ends. God willed <hi>Isaaks</hi> offering, so far as the commanding will reached, for the tryall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams faith and obedience,</hi> and this he revealed: But now God would not haue him offered, in regard of the event of the thing: but this as secret for the present, and till God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it in its time. Neither doe we (or the Apostle whose steps we tread in) by teaching that God <hi>hardens men by a will that cannot be resisted, say</hi> (as they ignorantly accuse us and him) <hi>that God compels men to trespass, and so to suffer.</hi> There is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion of any, but of him that is unwilling: but he that is hardned, is willingly hardned, as well as necessarily. His hardning of himselfe in a course of sin, is as voluntary, as is Gods hardning him by way of punishment, necessary and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible.</p>
               <p>The Apostle teacheth, how it is <hi>impossible for these who were</hi>

                  <hi>once enlightned, &amp; have tasted of the heavenly gift, &amp;c. if they fall away to renue them again to, or by repentance.</hi> If it be impossible for them to repent, then they remain impenitent necessarily by Gods just judgment upon them, and yet I suppose, voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also, even our adversaries being Iudges. Their impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy therefore and hardnesse of heart, though in regard of men a sin, and therefore voluntary: it is in regard of God a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and therefore necessary and irresistable, except we will say, that men can resist Gods judgments: and doe that which the Apostle affirmes to be <hi>impossible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither needs this deep and divine mystery of Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments trouble any that considers aright of these three things. First, that as the Sun puts no ill savour into the dung-hill, though the stink therof be increased by its shining: so neither doth God add any hardnesse, or impenitency to any, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaves unrestrained, occasions, stirrs up, and orders the corruption which he finds in men to this event. Secondly, that man is more willing to be impenitent, and hard-hearted, then God is to have him so. Thirdly, that this, in regard of man is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14749:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a sin: in regard of God, a punishment of former sins.</p>
               <p>The Apostles answer to the objection now followeth, v. 20. <hi>Nay, but O man, who art thou that disputest with God? shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another to dishonor?</hi> Wherein first, he represseth mans insolency, who being but <hi>man,</hi> yet dare presume to call <hi>Gods</hi> doing into question. 2. He justifies the Lords doing by his absolute power over the creature, as the potter hath power over his clay.</p>
               <p>And by this answer of the Apostle it appeares, how these men mistake his meaning in the question. His answer is not at all of this or that manner of saving men, (as they imagine and maintain) but of the saving of this person rather then that: they being both alike in themselves, and as <hi>the clay of the same lump.</hi> If <hi>Pauls</hi> answer should be shaped according to their misformed question, then the meaning must be; that the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might chuse which way he would make a vessell of honor,<note place="margin">Pag. 71. 72<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> whether by <hi>the workes of the Law,</hi> or by <hi>faith and obedience to the Gospell:</hi> and so not of the same lump, but of two contrary lumps: the one <hi>beleeving and obeying;</hi> the other, <hi>not turning from hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> The Apostle here plainly pleads the Lords power over the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to make him a vessell of honor or dishonor: they plead the Lords power over the means onely, by which he will do this. He, the Lords power over the clay of the same lump: but they, over clay of clean contrary <hi>qualities.</hi> Besides, if <hi>Paul</hi> meant here to bring in the Iewes defending themselves, that God had no cause <hi>to complain that they stuck to the Law,</hi> that is, looked <hi>to be justified by it, seeing Gods will was that men</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 69.</note> 
                  <hi>should obey his Lawes, and so live in them,</hi> what needed he to haue sought so farre for an answer, as the absolute <hi>power</hi> of God? seeing he had an answer at hand which might have stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped all mouthes, and which he ever presseth when question is<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 23. &amp; 4. 15.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14749:51"/>
be justified by it.</p>
               <p>Lastly, their exposition of these words, <hi>Why hast thou made me thus?</hi> that is, <hi>that I cannot obtain salvation by the workes of the Law,</hi> directly crosseth the Apostle, who grants that God <hi>made</hi> men, as is there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> objected, and justifies him in so making or framing them, both in his decree, and work of holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, by the <hi>power</hi> which he hath over men, as the <hi>potter over his clay, Hath not the potter power over the clay? &amp;c.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,<note place="margin">Vers. 21.</note> men make themselves uncapable of salvation by the Law, in that they keep it not. But the Apostle here speaks of <hi>Gods making</hi> men, <hi>vessels unto dishonor,</hi> and not of mens making themselves; and of the potter making the vessell, and not of the vessels making it self thus, or thus. It is plain <hi>Paul</hi> grants the objection, that no man can resist Gods will; and yet justifies his complaining, considering his power over his creature to decree, and so to bring unto most contrary estates by just and convenient meanes, persons in themselves alike, and as the clay of one lump, v. 21. 22. 23.</p>

               <p>I Deny their peremptory assertion, and require their proof. If they say the same words are there; first, that is not simply true; for part of them onely are there to be found, and so are they in other places, by name Esay 45. 9. where it is evident, the Prophet speaks of another matter. It is too weak a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, that because the like phrase or form of speech in part, is to be found in two places, that therefore the one is taken out of the other, and that to the same purpose. And to put
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14749:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the matter out of doubt, it is evident that the Prophet, and Apostle speak of clean divers things: the Prophet speaks of marring the vessell, and making it again; that is, of destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing persons or peoples, if they repent not; or doing good to them which repent: The Apostle, of making the vessell out of the masse, or lump, honourable or dishonourable. The Prophet speaks of the making or marring of one and the same vessell: the Apostle of divers vessels, and the making of one to honour, and another to dishonour. Lastly, the Apostle here speaks of the Lords purpose and work, without respect to good or evill done by the persons, and considering them as clay of the same lump: the Prophets, of Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with persons, according to the good or evill which hee finds in them, and so being divers, yea clean contrary lumps. And where they insinuate, that we hold the <hi>making of the clay to be in creation,</hi> which they affirm to be in <hi>vocation;</hi> they speak untruely in both. No man ever held that God in, or by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made any vessell to dishonour; neither can they ascribe this, as they doe to <hi>vocation.</hi> Gods calling men is not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, but to honour onely. It is the divell, and his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not God, who call men to dishonour, which these men also proue against themselvs at large, in the two pages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing;<note place="margin">Pag. 72. 73</note> and therin pull down with the one hand, what they haue built with the other, as children use to doe with their cob-castles.</p>
               <p>That which followeth, v. 24. 25 &amp;c. is not to the thing in hand. The disputation about <hi>election</hi> ends, v. 23, and that of <hi>vocation</hi> followeth: which latter is an effect of the former, declaring indeed the persons, but not confounding the things.</p>

                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5. 2 Cor. 12. 9. 1 Cor. 15. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>sufficient,</hi> as of God; that the faithfull may be <hi>weak</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs, and haue <hi>God perfecting his strength</hi> in mans weakenesse; that <hi>not</hi> a mans selfe, <hi>but the grace of God in him may labour aboundantly,</hi> that is, he by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So considering his <hi>bones</hi> in themselvs, and their<note place="margin">Psal. 16. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If now with this consideration, that a beleever may of himselfe fall away, we conjoyn this other, that the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and admonitions in the Scriptures, are means sanctified

of God to keep, and preserv all his from such apostasie, how should it seem strange unto any, that God should infallibly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his own end (the perseverance of his Saints) by his own means, which these exhortations are? Is it a good argument that God may fail of his end, because he useth effectuall means wherby to obtain it, as exhortations and warnings are, to perseverance? Is it a good argument, that the conduit may want water, because a man (skilfull in water-works) layeth the conduit pipes with all diligence, and Art, between the Spring-head, and the Conduit? Or that the childe (whom his father holding him fast by the hand, in a slippery way, and bidding him look that he fall not) can fall out of his fathers hand? Nay, though left to himselfe, he may, yea cannot but fall; yet considering his Fathers strength (supposing him one that cannot fall himselfe) wherof the childe is made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers for his supportance, he cannot fall: Such a holding, and helping hand of God are these exhortations, made effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall by his Spirit in the hearts of his children, true beleevers.

               <p>To conclude this point.

that these Apostles should not, and that willingly, preach this Gospell, and the truths thereof? This to affirm were to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the holy Spirit of God, by which they were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and infallibly guided in their Ministery.

               <p>THE Apostle doth not so conclude, but exhorts them onely to take head thereof: and of that matter we spake<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 23. 27.</note> even now at large. <hi>Esau</hi> was a <hi>prophane person</hi> before he sold his birth-right, and never other; No doubt but a prophane person, or hypocrite, nourishing in himselfe the <hi>root of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> though living in the Church, may loose whatsoever right he had; and of such the Apostle here speaks. If it be further objected, that <hi>Esau</hi> had right indeed to the <hi>birth-right</hi> (by them unskilfully called the <hi>inheritance</hi>) I answer, that he had never right to it spiritually, nor in Gods appoyntment, but onely in outward course, and in regard of men: and such a right to the heavenly inheritance may be, and is, by too many lost, as the Apostle here insinuates. Lastly, who sees not the difference between the inward grace of faith and holines in the heart of a true beleever; and the carnall right to that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to good, and bad?</p>
               <p>In <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 15. Christ sayth not as they accuse him, that <hi>salt may loose his savour:</hi> but <hi>if the salt loose his savour,</hi> as he sayth. <hi>If it be possible, let this cup passe from me:</hi> which yet (all things<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 39<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14749:55"/>
lately treated, and shall more hereafter. I suppose it was never seen, that salt wanted saltnesse: and if it doe, how is it salt? Besides, Christ calles not his Apostles <hi>salt,</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> in regard of the grace of faith in their hearts; but of their preaching the Gospell, therewith to season and inlighten the world. 2. Pet. 2. 20. they pervert as the former places: making that abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute which is but conditionall, and with an <hi>If. They</hi> (say they) <hi>which are washed, may return with the sow, to wallow in the myre, and their latter end be worse then the beginning.</hi> The Apostle sayth, <hi>If after they be washed,</hi> &amp;c. These forms of speech, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in scripture, or other where, <hi>If this, then that,</hi> do not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily prove, that either <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> is so indeed; but onely, that if <hi>this</hi> be so, then <hi>that</hi> also. Both <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves may be impossible, and yet the consequence good: as if I should say at mid-night, <hi>If it be day, the Sun is rising;</hi> or at mid-day, <hi>If it be night, the Sun is set:</hi> so in the Scriptures, Luk. 19. 40. 1. Cor. 15. 13, 14. 15. 16. &amp;c. Gal. 1. 5. 10. and in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite other places. It is sufficient for the truth of a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall proposition, that the latter part follow infallibly upon the former; if it be; but requires not that it should be. These men and others herein labour of the same mistaking with the Disciples, Ioh. 21. 22. 23. who upon Christs words <hi>to Peter</hi> touching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Iohn, If I will that he tarry till<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I come, what is that to thee?</hi> concluded, that <hi>Iohn should not dye,</hi> but should survive till the second comming of Christ; which fancy also continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a long time in the mindes of many. But the Evangelist in<note place="margin">Vers. 23.</note> the same place teacheth them that will learn, not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete conditionall speeches, as absolute? <hi>Iesus sayd not unto him, he shall not dye; but, if I will that he tarry till I come, or dye not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be further replyed, that the Apostle aimes at certaine particular persons, which <hi>denyed the Lord that bought them, whose pernicious wayes others followed, &amp; unto whom it did happen according to the true proverb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The dog is turned to his vomit again:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 4.</note> which same persons <hi>Iude</hi> also chargeth to <hi>haue turned the grace of God into wantonnesse;</hi> I willingly grant the thing so to haue
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14749:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
been; but deny the conditionall form of speech to proue it absolutely. And for the thing, I answer, that the Apostles there speak of mens being <hi>purged</hi> and <hi>washed,</hi> and the like, according to the outward profession onely, which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made, and which the Church took knowledge of: and not according to the inward truth of the heart, which they knew not, but God alone. I add, to put the matter wholly out of question, that these Apostles thus speaking, doe in the same places both gather themselves by the event, and teach us that these persons, of whom they speak, were never truely and effectually sanctified, but onely in their own, and other mens opinion: as where <hi>Peter,</hi> v. 7. 8. 9. opposing <hi>righteous Lot</hi> to the <hi>wicked Sodomites,</hi> addeth, that as <hi>God delivered him,</hi> so fo he <hi>knoweth,</hi> that is, can and will <hi>deliver the godly out of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and to reserve the unrighteous to the day of judgment for punishment.</hi> Likewise v. 21. <hi>The dog is turned to his own vomit again: and the sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the myre.</hi> They were alwayes then, in truth, but <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Swine,</hi> though sometimes vomiting dogs, and washed on the out-side as swine are in the waters. And yet more plainly, of the same persons <hi>Iude</hi> sayth, v. 4. that they were <hi>ungodly men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of old ordained to that condemnation,</hi> and such as <hi>crept in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares.</hi> They were at the best but hypocrites, in truth, and such as had crept in unawares, though seeming for a time to others (and it may be to themselves also) sanctified and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by their outward profession which profession formerly by them made, the Apostle upbraids them with, to their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confusion.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. the same answer serveth. The form of speech is but conditionall, <hi>If we sin wilfully,</hi> &amp;c. v. 26. which proves, that if any so sin, then <hi>there remaines no more sacrifice</hi> for him: but proves not that any truly justified and sanctified, doth so sin. If it be asked, to what end then serves the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full denunciation used? I answer, first, to keep the truely faithfull from so sinning: 2. to awaken even the secure, if not not desperate. 3. to paint out the fearfull state of incurable
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14749:56"/>
hypocrites and Apostates. And as the particular persons unto whom the Apostle there hath reference, could not by him certainly be discerned ever to haue been truely and inwardly sanctified (<hi>for what man knoweth the things of a man, saue the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To 1. Tim. 1. 19. where it is sayd, that <hi>some,</hi> as <hi>Hymenaeus and Alexander</hi> by name, haue <hi>put away a good conscience, and made shipwrack of faith,</hi> I answer, (letting passe other things) that <hi>Paul</hi> speaks no more of them then he knowes: and so not knowing their heart, and inward man, (which onely God doth) he speaks of their faith, and good conscience, not as considered in their hearts, which he knew not; but in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profession, whereof he had taken knowledge. The same answer serveth to 1. Tim. 5. 12. if by the <hi>first faith</hi> there be not meant these womens former promise of serving the Church, in the widowes or Deaconesses office; and then it is nothing to the matter in hand.</p>
               <p>It is not sayd Exod. 32. 32. 33. in the text, but in their
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14749:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
glosse, that <hi>some written in the book of life may be blotted out, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> onely desires-there, that if God <hi>would not pardon his peoples sin,</hi> and bring them into <hi>Canaan, he would blot him out of his book.</hi> But the Lord answers him in the same place, that that cannot be, but that <hi>he that sins against him,</hi> him he will blot out. Is it to be conceived, that <hi>Moses</hi> for the sin of others; whereof he was altogether innocent, yea for his holy zeale and loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Gods people, should be blotted out of the book of life? If you say, that yet some (to wit <hi>sinning</hi>) may be <hi>blotted out,</hi> I grant it in Gods sense, but not in theirs. For first, this is meant of temporary, and not of eternall life, of the <hi>blotting</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 9. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>their name from vnder heaven;</hi> of the <hi>destroying them, and making of Moses a nation greater then they.</hi> Of that of which God is sayd to <hi>repent</hi> upon <hi>Moses</hi> his prayer, v. 14. which was onely in regard of their temporall state and life. 2. It is not onely vanity, but impiety also to affirm that these persons were ever truely justified and sanctified. Not onely <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> but God himselfe upon this very occasion testifies the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, v. 9. 22. Deut. 9. 7. 13. To Psal. 69. 29.

               <p>As the Black-more changeth not his skin; so neither doe they their bold manner, in putting their glosse for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: as appeares in the next place cited by them, Rev. 3. 5.

               <p>That by the <hi>Talents given to the servants,</hi> Math. 25, is meant the graces of justification and sanctification; and not the gifts of the Spirit given for the edification of the Church, as 1. Cor. 12. 7. &amp; Eph. 4. 8. is their presumption. Iustification &amp; sanctification make men the servants of Christ at first these talents were given to them that were servants already: and that <hi>according to their severall ability</hi> for their speciall places. Besides, the <hi>taking away of the talent</hi> here spoken of, is not in this life, but at the day of judgment: and therefore is unskilfully brought for their purpose.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>Pauls</hi> affirming <hi>that the Saints at Rome were justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith,</hi> Rom. 5, and yet threatning, <hi>that if they continued not in the bounty of God, they should be cut off,</hi> ch. 11. 21. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, as before; first, that the threatning is conditionall, as <hi>Gal</hi> 1. 8, <hi>If we, &amp;c.</hi> Was it possible that <hi>Paul</hi> should <hi>preach any other Gospell?</hi> Or were he an <hi>Angell from heaven,</hi> or of God that should so doe? I suppose no, ch. 4. 14. But an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell from hell rather, and of the divell. The question is not whether if any should not abide in the bounty of God, they were to be cut off or no? But whether any with whom hee hath dealt so bounteously, as indeed to justifie and sanctifie them, haue not also a promise, by his power, to be kept in that his bounty, by the means which he hath appointed? Secondly, <hi>Paul</hi> pronounceth those <hi>Romans</hi> justified, not from the judgement of certainty, but of charity. Of whom as some were undoubtedly sincere, whom God did by this, and the like warnings, preserv and keep in his grace: so for the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites mingled amongst them, it was but that which we say, if in their time they were broken off from that which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14749:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they seemed to others by their profession (and it may be to themselvs also) to haue had.</p>
               <p>And indeed, this very place, if it be well minded, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters full answer to the most of their Arguments. This warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (though immediately given to the <hi>Romans</hi>) concerns all Christians as well as them: And being founded upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Lords dealing with the <hi>Iews,</hi> must be expounded, and applyed accordingly. Who then were these exemplary <hi>Iews,</hi> formerly cut off by the Lord from the oliue tree? Were they such as had once truely beleeved, but had after made defection? I suppose not even in these mens judgment; but such as occupying a place in the Church, yet were, in truth, faithlesse hypocrites, and as <hi>chaff in the</hi> Lords <hi>flore,</hi> which<note place="margin">Math. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Onely the last place Math. 18. 32, where <hi>debt forgiven is,</hi> as they say <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called,</hi> were something to the purpose, if the drift of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable were to shew, that God indeed forgivs sins, and after unforgives them: which were lightnesse unbecomming any graue, and honest man. But the scope of the parable being no more, then that we ought to forgiue such as offend us, and that otherwise God will not forgiue us: to draw more from it, is to forget that it is a parable, and to take the high way to to most grievous errour. Besides, there is in this parable no colour for falling away from grace, and true godlinesse, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had; but onely (even their exposition being admitted) that a man may haue his sins pardoned, who yet wants all brotherly loue and goodnesse, which the Scriptures every where deny, Math. 6. 14. 15, Mark. 11. 24. 25, 1 Ioh. 3. 14. 15,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14749:58"/>
Rom. 8. 1, Ps. 32. 1. 2. Thirdly, by these grounds, no man can certainly know, that his sins are indeed pardoned, whilst he liues in the world, because he may still fall away, and so haue his pardon recalled, though <hi>sealed</hi> up unto him by the very <hi>spirit</hi> of God it selfe. And so all our faith must be but adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note> whilst we liue in the world, whether our sins past be in truth pardoned, or no; contrary to the Scriptures. Lastly, this impeacheth both the justice of God, and his truth. His justice in making him require double satisfaction for the same debt; first, of his Son, even the price of his bloud, and the same also by faith, applyed to the person that hath sinned and beleeveth; and after of the person himselfe. Of his truth, and that both of his word absolutely promising forgiuenesse of sins to him that beleeveth, and also of his spirit, by which<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 25.

               <p>To that which they alledge from Eph. 1. 4, compared with Rev. 2. 4. 5, I answer, first that <hi>Paul</hi> stiles those <hi>Ephesians elect</hi> onely as he knew them so to be; which was by outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of holinesse. Secondly, that the <hi>leaving of their first loue</hi> was not a total falling from grace, but onely a decaying of their former zeal.

that any one of the truely elect and sanctified <hi>Ephesians</hi> did wholly despise this and the like means of their bettering, I will then grant their proof strong.

                  <hi>in the Scriptures,</hi> that we <hi>receiv not the grace of God in vain,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 1, and the like, hath formerly been fully answered. They are not <hi>in vain,</hi> either in respect of elect or reprobate: neither yet will we own their absurd answer here fathered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, that <hi>the whole Scriptures are given to keep both elect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate from falling into grosse sins; yet that neither the elect can be damned by transgressing them, nor the reprobate saved by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them.</hi> The Scriptures haue divers ends; and amongst others, are given to keep all, not onely from grosse, but from all sins. Neither doe we affirm, that the elect cannot be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by transgressing them; or that the reprobate cannot be saved by observing them, as they like deceitfull proctors, plead for us, or rather for their own advantage. But this we say, that the elect and truely sanctified are so kept by the power of God in his feare, that they never transgresse as the wicked do; nor can, <hi>because his seed remaineth in them:</hi> that they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually renue their repentance; particular, for sins known, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which through infirmity they fall; and generall, for sinns unknown, as <hi>David</hi> did; and that even by means of those<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Psal. 50.

And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the reprobates, being left to themselvs of God, haue by their own and satans malice, their eyes so blinded, and hearts hardened, as though those means of exhortation come

unto them, they either understand them not, or beleev them not, or despise them; but never observ or obey them aright.</p>
               <p>Their curses of the doctrine in this point received in all Reformed Churches, as <hi>Atheisticall</hi> and <hi>damnable;</hi> and their <hi>blessing</hi> themselvs <hi>from</hi> it, is here as every where, the fruit of that wilde zeale, wherewith their ignorant hearts are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed.</p>
               <p>Their answers follow to the Scriptures brought against<note place="margin">Pag. 84.</note> them. The first is, Math. 24. 24. <hi>If it were possible they</hi> (the false Teachers) <hi>should deceiv the very elect. Whence we conclude</hi> (as they say) <hi>that it is not possible the elect should perish.</hi> And here first they shew, <hi>who are the elect of God;</hi> noting indeed the persons, but perverting the order of grace. If in saying, as they doe, that <hi>the elect of God, are those that receiv and obey the truth of Christ, and abide in him unto the death,</hi> they meant, that such as are chosen of God in his decree before the world, and actually and effectually, chosen and called in time by the Word and Spirit, to beleev and obey, did so abide to the death, it were but the truth, which the Scriptures teach and we professe: But intending, as they doe, that men haue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>the promise of actuall and particular election</hi> till then, but are not absolutely elected; and that absolute election follows this <hi>abiding in Christ till death;</hi> they are like the foolish buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which would lay the foundation upon the roofe of the house. By their comment upon Christs words, men should be in danger to be seduced by false Prophets, when they haue <hi>abiden in Christ unto death;</hi> for till then they will haue none elect: and the elect are here said to be in danger to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p>That which they gather from the <hi>manifold warnings</hi> in the<note place="margin">Pag. 85.</note> Scriptures <hi>to the elect,</hi> that <hi>none deceiv them</hi> &amp;c. is true; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>that the elect may fall from their election</hi> (or rather from the grace received) <hi>if they take not heed.</hi> But they should withall proue, that God doth ever, so far leav and forsake any truely justified, and sanctified in Christ, as that they take no heed at all, as they ought. It is certain, that if the very elect Angels

               <p>The next place is Ioh. 10. 27. 28, <hi>My sheep hear my voyce, and they know me, and follow me, and I giue unto them eternall life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any take them out of mine hand. My Father which hath given them me, is greater then all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They here conceiv <hi>the purpose</hi> of Christ to be, to <hi>confirm his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 86.</note> 
                  <hi>sheep, so long as they continue his sheep,</hi> &amp;c. But herein they draw violently Christs purpose to their own. For Christ, as may be seen, by comparing herewith v. 16. 26. 27, is to shew how it came to passe, that some of his hearers beleeved and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his voyce, and some not. Many of the Iews <hi>beleeved not, because they were not his sheep:</hi> some did, being his <hi>sheep,</hi> to wit, by destination of God. Christ saith not, that they are not his sheep, because they beleev not; but that they beleev not, because they are not his sheep; that is, not being of the elect of God, they are left to their own impenitent, and unbeleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, which they also willingly harden against Christs voyce. Where v. 16, he saith, <hi>Other sheep I haue which are not of this fold, whom also I must bring</hi> &amp;c, hee means the elect amongst the Heathens destinated to that one <hi>Sheep-fold,</hi> under him that one <hi>Shepheard,</hi> and by his voyce to be <hi>brought</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. This is yet more plain v. 15, where he saith, <hi>I giue my life for my sheep.</hi> Christ <hi>dyed for the ungodly,</hi> Rom. 5. 6. 8. By his sheep, therfore in this place, are meant the elect from eternity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:14749:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for whom he dyed: the fruit of which election of God, and death of Christ, sheweth forth it selfe in their timeous faith and obedience.</p>
               <p>Further, note we for the thing in hand, that Christ <hi>giues</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>unto his sheep, that hears his voyce and obey him, eternall life:</hi> as elsewhere also he saith, <hi>He that beleeveth on the Son hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>life.</hi> If this life which they haue <hi>given them,</hi> and <hi>haue</hi> (in the beginnings of it) even in this life, be <hi>eternall</hi> and <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting;</hi> how can it be broken off afterwards? Or if it can be interrupted and broken off, how is it <hi>everlasting</hi> and <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, if <hi>none be able to pluck Christs sheep out of his, and his Fathers hand:</hi> then no sinfull person, or temptation, no malice of Satan can turn them from God: for if they can, then they can pluck them out of Gods hand. Is not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying and corrupting of mens faith and obedience, the plucking them out of the hand of God? V. 12, the same word is used, <hi>the wolfe catcheth and scattreth the sheep,</hi> that is, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them, as Math. 7. 10, Act. 20. 29, where the same word is used also. As they are elsewhere too prodigall of Christs benefits to all the goats in the world, so are they here too nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly of them to his own sheep: Although in truth they grant, though unawares, as much as we plead for, in saying, that those <hi>sheep, so long as they continue his sheep, haue spirituall peace and safety</hi> &amp;c. Spirituall peace and safety is against all assaults of all spirituall enemies, labouring to subvert the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall state of Gods people.</p>

               <p>We affirm, that God predestinates none to salvation but with condition of the death of Christ, and the persons (coming to years of discretion) faith, and repentance, and continuance therin to the end, to goe before that their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: nor to damnation, but with condition of sin, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency therein to goe before that their damnation. But our Adversaries being bold and presumptuous, speak evill of the things which they neither know, nor are walling to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. Onely, these two things we further hold in this case. First, that the former conditions (Christ, and faith in him) are Gods free gifts also, infallibly and effectually obtained by the former persons: the latter condition (impenitency in sin) the certain effect of Satans malice, and their own corruption, being left of God thereunto. The second is, that other reason, why God hath, of two alike corrupt in themselvs, preordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the former to salvation, by the former means; and the latter to condemnation, by the latter; the Scriptures doe not acquaint us with then the meer <hi>pleasure</hi> of him, who <hi>hath mercy on whom he will haue mercy, and whom he will, hee hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth:</hi>

And if the good seed were the Gospell, and the tares false doctrines, as they (transforming persons into things) would make them; yet is it untruely affirmed by them, that <hi>the persons of them who receiv the good seed were no better then the other, nor the persons of them who receiv the tares any worse then the other.</hi> That both are alike, to wit, dead in sin, when God offereth the Gospel, we willingly grant, and are glad to hear them confess: but to say they are both alike, when the one receivs the Gospell, and the other refuseth it, and receivs the tares contrary unto it, is to say that the good ground, and the bad, are both alike. For what makes them that are alike, when the Gospel comes alike unto them, not to remain alike stil? And what is the reason why the one receivs it, and not the other? They say, <hi>because the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Sower first sowed it, and therfore he hath cause to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 91.</note> 
                  <hi>praise him onely.</hi> But, say I, this goodnesse is alike to both the two in sowing, or offering the Gospels seed: Whereupon it must follow, that he who receivs this good seed, hath no more cause to praise God the Sower, then he that receivs it not: for it is sowen alike on both, in regard of outward offer; but for the ones receiving of it, rather then the other, he hath cause to thank himselfe alone, and his own freewill. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is the mark at which all those Adversaries arrows are shot. But the Scriptures teach us a further thing, then these ungratefull persons will acknowledge; which is, that besides, and aboue the offer common to both, <hi>God giues the encrease</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Act. 16. 14</note> And as persons receiv the word of God into their hearts by his opening them first, so in that his gracious work in them, hee makes them which were before alike, in spirituall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to become unlike, and better then other; and so more beloved then others for the godly <hi>qualities,</hi> as they call them, which he hath wrought in them. Neither doth the Lord <hi>hate</hi> onely <hi>the works of wicked men,</hi> as they say; but also

the <hi>workers of iniquity:</hi> not with a passion of the mind, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred<note place="margin">Ps. 5. 5 6.</note> is in man, but with a holy will to punish the violation of his righteous Law. And though with a generall loue of the Creator to the creature, he alwaies, after a sort, <hi>loue the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of men,</hi> as being his generation, yet he loues, (as is meet) the honour of his holinesse, more then the happinesse of his creature, having violated and prophaned it without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

               <p>A Riddle, better fitting <hi>H. N.</hi> then the professours of the truth in simplicity. It behoues us therefore a little to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon the Text, opening it according to the Apostles mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ours with him; and first proving against them, that by those that <hi>went out,</hi> are not meant <hi>the lying spirits in the persons,</hi> but the persons themselues.</p>
               <p>And first, these words, <hi>They went out from us,</hi> or better, <hi>from out of us,</hi> shew, that those out-goers were formerly of them in a respect; else how could they haue gone out from them? But lying spirits were never of the Apostles and Saints; but the persons sometimes were. Secondly, hee saith not, as they corrupt the Text, <hi>If they had been of the truth,</hi> but <hi>of us;</hi> nor <hi>they would hane continued with it,</hi> but <hi>with us,</hi> nor, <hi>but they are not of it,</hi> but <hi>they were not of us:</hi> all carrying it to persons so, and so qualified. Thirdly, Is it to be conceived, that the Apostle would complain (as heere he doth) that lying spirits did not continue with the Churches? Fourthly, in saying, <hi>They went out of us, that it might be manifest that they were not all of us,</hi> he shews that by their out-leaps, something was manifested which was hid before. But it was plain before, to the Apostles and Saints, that lying spirits were not of the truth. He speaks therefore of the persons of hypocrites, whom by this their professed defection, God discovered. Fithly, in saying, <hi>they were not all of us,</hi> he insinuates that some of them were; What? some <hi>lying spirits of the Spirit of truth?</hi> No, but that not all the persons that formerly professed the truth with them, were true members of Christs body, which they were. Lastly, v. 20, He makes an opposition between them of whom hee writes, and to whom. <hi>But yee</hi> What? yee spirits, and so v. 28, <hi>little children,</hi> that is, little spirits. All may see with what spirit these men are led. He then speaks of the going out of persons, not of spirits, as they mean; but being indeed <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs,</hi> as v. 18, in regard of their spirits, and doctrines, for which they pretended the spirit of Christ.</p>

               <p>The meaning of <hi>Iohn</hi> is plain enough, that these Antichrists went out of the Church, not by making any seperation, or schism from it, as some thinke (for they still continued in the outward fellowship, preaching, and <hi>prophesying</hi> and <hi>deceiving;</hi>)<note place="margin">Chap. 2. 26.

Which truth this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle confirms further, ch. 3, very evidently, saying; <hi>whosoever</hi>

               <p>One observation I will here annex, and so conclude this Head. <hi>It cannot be,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>but offences will come.</hi> And of<note place="margin">Math. 18.</note> all offences, none is greater, and which more wounds the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heart of a weak Christian, then when he sees such, as by their former profession and appearances, haue purchased to

This occasions him to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect (Satan by suggestions of unbelief, furthering him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) that there is not in the course of Christianity, that power of grace, stablenesse, and true comfort, which it promiseth.

And for that which is good, God works it by inclination, by his Word and Spirit; which inclination cannot be compulsion, seeing compulsion and violence is onely against the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the thing, and not the inclining of it.

What mean then the holy Scriptures speaking so frequently of this <hi>Spirits</hi> work in men, with means, without means; for ordinary, and extraordinary operations, both gifts, and graces? Or if there be such a spirit of God dwelling, and working in men, why doe they deny unto it, a prevailing power, wheresoever it pleaseth God to bestow it? And for those that <hi>cannot repent,</hi> as they plead for <hi>some;</hi> God, and their own consciences will plead against them, that they will not repent: and so are not <hi>tyed with a coard</hi> by others, and violently with-held, as they plead for them, but doe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly cast, and keep the coards of iniquity, and rebellion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselvs.</p>
               <p>We acknowledg also (and they therefore prove in vain)<note place="margin">Pag. 100 101.</note> that to whomsoever the word comes, them <hi>God would have gathered unto him, hearken unto his voyce, repent that they might live and not dy,</hi> to wit, in that degeee of willing, which stands in commanding those things, and approving them if they follow; and that <hi>the fault is onely in mens obstinacy, if they repent not.</hi>

bounden duty (as these men seem to make it) to bestow that grace upon them.</p>
               <p>The two places Esa. 5. 1. 2. 3, &amp;c. and Math: 11. 21. 22, we will a little more particularly examine. In the former where God saith, he <hi>could doe no more to his vineyard then he had done,</hi> he speaks onely of outward means, as the text makes it plain, <hi>I fenced it &amp;c.</hi> I would ask these men, whether there be not requisite, that the naturall vineyard may bring forth fruit, something besides the <hi>fencing, gathering out of the stones,</hi> and the rest there mentioned? It cannot be denyed, that, except be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, and above all these, God give the encrease by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward blessing, all <hi>planting,</hi> &amp; <hi>watering,</hi> and outward dressing whatsoever is <hi>nothing:</hi> so is it in the spirituall vineyard much more though planted by <hi>Paul</hi> himself, yea by Christ himself in the outward ministery. And where God saith, <hi>He expected sweet grapes, but it brought forth wild v:4.</hi> we must not imagine (as our adversaries seem to doe) that God is deceaved in his expectation, as men often are: but onely, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> did not perform that which God required, and they ought.</p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>repentance</hi> of <hi>Tyre &amp; Sidon.</hi> First I would know how they prove that Christ speaks of other then legall repentance, such as <hi>Ahab</hi> manifested <hi>in sack-cloth?</hi> which was<note place="margin">1. King. 21. 26.</note> not from <hi>a godly sorrow</hi> for sin; but from a servile fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. Secondly eyther this repentance should haue been wrought by those <hi>mighty works</hi> alone, or by them with other helps. <hi>Mighty works</hi> alone cannot work <hi>faith,</hi> &amp; <hi>repentance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17 2. Tim. 2. 25. Mar. 16. 20</note> which must come <hi>by hearing,</hi> &amp; <hi>instructions of the word,</hi> which they serve to <hi>confirm</hi> unto men. If Christ speak of his <hi>mighty works,</hi> as means though not sufficient of themselvs, yet availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, with other requisite helps, he excludes not the spirits work, but includes it. But, in truth, the meaning of Christ seems to be no more, but to reprove the obstinacy of <hi>Corazin</hi> in a form of speach like unto that Luk. 19. 40. <hi>If these should hold their tongue, the stones would imediately cry out.</hi> And as it were a vain thing hence to dispute about the speaking of stones; so is it, to gather any thing thence of the <hi>Tyrians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:14749:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The meaning of the Lord here is not to commend the <hi>Tyrians</hi> at all, but to upbraid the <hi>Chorazites,</hi> and to shew their hardnes of heart to be greater then the others. The like form of speach we haue to the like purpose Ezech: 3. 6. And if so be there were in these <hi>Tyrians</hi> this pronenes to repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they had enjoyed the means which the others did, but they wanted; &amp; withall, that God so desires the repentance &amp; salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all; how came it to passe, that God did not afford those helps unto them that were so prone and willing to have used them aright? It seems, the former case is now altered, and that men might say to God, that <hi>they would, but he would not.</hi>

               <p>AN ignorant assertion, shewing the ground of their errour in not putting difference between Gods work, and mans. They may as rightly say, that the life and motion of the childe is its begetting. To regenerate is nothing else, but to beget anew. Doth the child beget it selfe? Or doth not the parent onely beget it? So God begets by the Ministery of the Word, and man is begotten by him: according to that of the Apostle, <hi>Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>that is begotten of him.</hi> So Iam. 1. 18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us, by the word of truth.</hi> By these mens doctrine we should beget our selvs of our own will. Begetting in creatures, is both in nature and time, before the being of the begotten. Men then before they be, must beget themselvs, by their saying. And as God regenerates, and not man; so doth man, being rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, beleev and obey, and not God.

               <p>This Head they shut with answering three Scriptures. The first Math. 22, but mistaken, for Luk. 14. 23, which as it is frivolously objected (if by any) so is it easily answered.</p>
               <p>The second is, Ioh. 6. 44. <hi>No man can come to me except the Father draw him. This is not meant</hi> (say they) <hi>of violent compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 109.</note> True, nor yet onely (as they would haue it) of <hi>outward teaching by heavenly doctrine:</hi> For thus the Father drew many that came not to Christ; whereas hee speaks here, of such a <hi>drawing</hi> as is peculiar to them that <hi>come</hi> to him; who <hi>shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hunger,</hi> v. 35, and whom he <hi>will in no wise cast out,</hi> v. 37. He speaks not therefore of the outward teaching onely, but withall, and principally, of the inward teaching of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as Esa. 54. 13, Ier. 31. 33. 34, 1 Ioh. 2. 27. The most of them whom the Father drew by heavenly doctrine, that is, to whom Christ preached, <hi>murmured at him,</hi> v. 41: this hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues, vers. 43, &amp; vers. 44, takes away the offence which might arise, at the consideration of the small effect which his words had with many, considering what he testified of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, v. 39. 40, shewing that such was mans perversenesse in spirituall things, as that except God, to the outward word, adjoyned the inward work of the Spirit, thereby drawing him, his obstinacy could not, nor would not be tamed, nor he turned to God.</p>
               <p>Lastly, to Phil. 2. 13. <hi>It is God that works in you both the will and deed,</hi> after much impertinent discourse, and many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours<note place="margin">Pag. 110. 111. 112.</note> mingled among, they answer, that <hi>God doth this in men</hi>

                  <hi>by reasons, and perswasions, that they would chuse life, and avoyd death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And first, they conclude without and against reason, that if the <hi>regenerate haue power to resist, they haue power not to resist:</hi> which is, as if a man should say, if a fool can doe foolishly, then he can doe wisely, or the like.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is a slander upon the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> that <hi>they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi> in this point; or that any of them <hi>affirms, that the elect though unregenerate, cannot resist good.</hi> Whilst they are unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate they can doe nothing else but resist in spirituall things: But God in time (as he hath decreed) by the spirit of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, overcomes their corruption, and works in them, not to resist, but willingly to follow him, that calleth them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I would know what they mean by these phrases, of <hi>Gods sending his word and spirit to work our regeneration:</hi> and again, of <hi>God by the power of his word and spirit, shewing man the benefite of life</hi> &amp;c. If they consider the spirit onely as the Authour of the word, speaking in the men of God, why doe they not say <hi>the Spirit and the Word,</hi> rather then, as they do, <hi>the Word and the Spirit?</hi> Or how doth God <hi>send the spirit,</hi> thus understood, <hi>to work regeneration in men?</hi> If they answer, that God is ready to giue the spirit, and so doth to them that will receiv it: first, to be ready to giue, is not to giue or send: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they should understand, that to be willing to receiv spirituall things, is a main fruit and effect of regeneration, and therfore not a cause, as they mistake. For the will, thus holily bent, presupposeth the understanding divinely enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whose direction it follows, and without which going before, it is blind and brutish. Neither can a man possibly will a thing, but as he understands it to be good for him. If the understanding be divinely inlightned, and the will holily bent, then the whole man is before regenerated, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten before of God by the spirit of regeneration. In truth, they but speak of <hi>Gods sending his Spirit to work in mans rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> as <hi>Senacherib</hi> by <hi>Rabsakah</hi> spake of <hi>Gods sending him</hi>

               <p>To conclude this Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> referring the Reader to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note place="margin">Pag. 44. 45. 46. 47.</note> of conviction formerly laid down, I onely add thus much: that if <hi>God onely bend the will by perswasions of promises and threatnings,</hi> and works not otherwise, then by <hi>force of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 108. 109. 111. Mat. 11. 25 1 Cor. 1. 26. 27.</note> and <hi>by using strong arguments and perswasions,</hi> as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly affirm; then, that, whose contrary, both the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and experience confirms, would ordinarily come to passe; namely, that the <hi>wise and prudent</hi> should haue heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things <hi>revealed</hi> unto them, and discern them much more easily and effectually, then <hi>babes</hi> and <hi>weak</hi> persons; and so should be converted sooner then they: specially sooner then harlots and light persons, considering how much better they mind and understand; arguments and reasons of all sorts; then the other. We therfore conclude with the Apostle, that God <hi>works in us both the will and the deed:</hi> not onely by his word working on us, but by his Spirit working in us: not onely by sending <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>plant,</hi> by propounding strong arguments of perswasion, but also <hi>by giving the increase</hi> by the most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all work of his Spirit, <hi>inlightning the eyes of the understanding</hi>

               <p>INfants had no life, nor being, as Adam had, at that time, when God gaue the Law to Adam; and therfore no Law was given unto them; and therfore sinned not, nor were guilty of condemnation.</p>

               <p>I Grant, that infants had then no life and being, as <hi>Adam</hi> had, to wit, actuall, and distinct: but affirm, that they had both, after a sort, and as the branches in the root. <hi>Odegos</hi> (the <hi>guide of the blinde,</hi> as Rom. 2. 19,) affirms, pag. 114, that <hi>mankind was in Adam in bodily substance;</hi> they had therfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Adam</hi> after a sort, namely, so far as they were in him. If they had being in <hi>Adam</hi> any way, they had <hi>life</hi> also in him: for nothing in <hi>Adam</hi> was dead, but all living: their being therefore so far, as it was in him, was a living being.</p>
               <p>We reade Hebr. 7. 9, that <hi>Levi payed tithes to Melchisedeck in Abraham.</hi> But how could this be, might one say, seeing <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi had then no life and being?</hi> The Apostle answers, that he was <hi>in the loyns of his father Abraham, when Melchisedeck met him.</hi> And reason teacheth, that none can doe any act, but he must first be, nor doe it otherwise, then as he is. <hi>Levi</hi> therefore then had a kind of <hi>being,</hi> and that <hi>living,</hi> and reasonable also, as he performed that act of <hi>paying tithes.</hi> He in <hi>Abraham</hi> as a particular root: Mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> as in a generall root.</p>
               <p>2 That <hi>Infants had a Law given them,</hi> I thus proue. First, the word of God, Gen. 2. 17. <hi>In the day, that thou eatest of the tree of knowledge of good, and evill, thou shalt die the death;</hi> shew, that whom God threatneth with death, to them he gaue the Law. The punishment Gen. 3. 17. 18. 19, reacheth to all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> posterity, and so the threatning, and by consequence the Law. Secondly, the Apostle teacheth, Rom. 2. 15, that <hi>the Law is written in the hearts of the Gentiles,</hi> according to which Law of nature written in their hearts (though they had it not written in tables of stone, as the Iews) they shall be <hi>judged at</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:14749:71"/>
                  <hi>the day</hi> of the Lord, v. 15. 16. 17. These Gentiles cannot be imagined to haue this Law thus written any other way, then as God in the beginning created <hi>Adam,</hi> and all mankind in him, after his Image, in righteousnesse and holinesse; in which respect also they are said, to <hi>doe by nature the things contained in the Law,</hi> having also a naturall <hi>conscience</hi> in them, which without a Law were vain: Vnder which generall Law, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reasonable creature to faith and obedience in all things (in disposition before use of discretion, and in act af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards:) the particular Law, Gen. 2, is conteyned, and to be referred unto it. Thirdly, if infants haue reasonable soules, then haue they the faculties of understanding and will, though not the actuall use of them, as men haue. This understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot be conceived by any to be without all disposition and pronenesse, either to the knowledg of God, or to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, errour, and doubting of him; nor this will to bee without all disposition, and inclination to will according to, or against Gods will. As the yong whelps and cubs, of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Beares, and Foxes, haue in their naturall and sensitiue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, a pronenesse and inclination to raven; and every beast pronenesse to the things of its kind, after, actually performed, and practised by them: so haue infants necessarily in their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable faculties, a disposition, one or other, to understand and will things, specially such as concern God, by reason of the most naturall, necessary, and indossolible relation, between the reasonable creature, and the Creator, and that specially in those most noble faculties.</p>
               <p>The objection from Rom. 7. 1, hath in it no colour of truth: for neither are there any such words, that <hi>the Law is given</hi> (especially onely, which must be added) <hi>to them that know it:</hi> neither doth the Apostle there intend at all, to shew to whom the Law was given, or not: but onely, that the Christian Church at <hi>Rome</hi> (specially many of them being Iewes, as appears chap. 16,) to which he wrote, was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Law, whether generall or particular, to which he had reference in that place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:14749:72"/>To Deut. 11. 2, besides things answered by Mr. <hi>Ainsworth,</hi> I adde, that <hi>Moses</hi> there excludes not onely infants, but many grown men as appears, v. 3. 4. The other two places Matth. 13. 9, and 1 Cor. 10. 15, exclude too many mens of years also, considering how few haue <hi>ears to hear,</hi> or <hi>understanding</hi> to judg aright of spirituall things.</p>
               <p>For the third head, and that <hi>all sinned in Adam,</hi> it is so plain from Rom. 5, as they haue nothing at all to answer,<note place="margin">Vers. 12.</note> though they object the place: onely they bring certain other Scriptures, in such a manner, as if they would disproue one Scripture by another. And indeed what exposition can be given, or evasion found, considering the expressenes of the words? <hi>As by one man sinne entred into the world, and death by sinne, so death passed upon all men, for that</hi> (or as the originall hath it) <hi>in whom all men haue sinned.</hi> So v. 19, <hi>As by one mans disobedience many were made sinners,</hi> &amp;c. If they say, as some doe, that all are made sinners by imitation onely, they are clearly confuted; first, by daily experience, in which it is plain, that children comming to some discerning, will lie, filch, and revenge themselvs, though they never heard lie told, &amp;c. It is alas too evident, that they bring this corruption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world with them. Secondly, by the Apostles words, v. 19, <hi>For as by ones mans disobedience many were made sinners; so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</hi> If wee bee made unrighteous onely by imitation of <hi>Adams</hi> sin, and not by his performing it, as our root naturally; then we are made righteous onely by imitation of Christs righteousnesse, and not by his performing righteousnesse, and fulfilling the Law for us, as our spirituall root, in which wee are grafted by faith.</p>
               <p>Lastly, these Adversaries grant, that <hi>by Adams sin all his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 117.</note> 
                  <hi>posterity haue weak natures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which when the commandement comes, they cannot obey, and liue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but sin, and so die, Rom.</hi> 8. 3.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Can they which are accustomed to doe evill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doe well?</hi> Or will these men never leav their godlesse custom of corrupting the words of the text, for advantaging of an evill cause? For <hi>flesh,</hi> which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14749:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Text hath, they put <hi>nature:</hi> wheras it is without all questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that by <hi>flesh,</hi> the Apostle there understands properly, sin and <hi>sinfull flesh:</hi> as he expresly calleth it, and as is plain in the whole context, v. 1. 2. 4. 5. 6. 7, &amp;c. In all which hee opposeth the <hi>flesh</hi> to the <hi>spirit,</hi> and the sinfull life of the one, to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous life of the other.</p>
               <p>And I would know of these deep Divines, what but sin could possibly make <hi>Adams</hi> posterity unable to keep the Law? This flesh, or nature, as they will haue it, must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this <hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy Law,</hi> and resist it. And is not that<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 12.</note> properly sinfull and unholy, which resists, and is contrary to<note place="margin">See Rom. 7. 17. 18, &amp;c. &amp; Gal. 5. 17.</note> that which is good and holy; Lastly, this enemy to the Law of God in a man, must be in his soule. And what else can it be, then a disposition in the understanding, to ignorance and errour, touching God and heavenly things; and an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the will and affections to evill? Which is as properly sinne, as their acts and effects are properly sinfull. Infants therefore bring sin properly into the world with them.</p>
               <p>Two things they here object: First, that <hi>Christ often accounts children, innocents,</hi> as Math. 18. 3. 4, &amp; 19. 14. I answer, first, not as they mean; that is, such as haue in them nothing vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 4. &amp; ch. 19. 13. 14. Mark. 10. 14. 15. 16.</note> or vitious; good, or evill; but as being <hi>humble,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pride; and such, as unto whom <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> and his <hi>blessing</hi> did appertain. Secondly, He speaks not of all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but of those, of, and in the Church.</p>
               <p>Their second objection is, that <hi>our soules being the subjects of sin, are created of God imediately.</hi> But to this objection, they that referrs the soules originall, imediately to Gods super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, and indeed miraculous work, do giue divers answers, which these Adversaries should haue refuted. Amongst others, Mr. <hi>Ainsworths</hi> answer is worthy the consideration. But let us consider their proofs for the soules immediate creation. The first is, Act. 17. 26, <hi>Of one bloud God made all mankind,</hi> &amp;c. But this place makes rather against them; seeing the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy alone makes not mankind, but the soule with it, by which specially the man is. The next place is Heb. 12. 9, whence
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14749:73"/>
they <hi>gather that Adam is the Father of our bodies, and God the Father of our Spirits.</hi> But first, the Text neither mentions <hi>Adam,</hi> nor can agree to him in the state of creation: seeing in that estate there was no use of <hi>correction.</hi> Secondly, it saith not, <hi>the fathers of our bodies,</hi> but <hi>of our flesh:</hi> nor the <hi>father</hi> of<note place="margin">See: Com. pub. &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate pa. 107</note> our Spirits, but <hi>of Spirits.</hi> And the meaning seems unto me (with due respect had to other mens different judgment) one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be this: that if we giue honour to men (our carnall or fleshly fathers) chastening us, as they think good: how much more owe honour to our spirituall father, chastening us for our eternall good? And surely God, in his kinde, is the father of the whole man, not of the soule onely: So is man, in his kinde, the father of the whole man, and not of the body one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Lastly, seeing the drift of the place, is to shew, that God as a <hi>father, chasteneth his sons which he loveth,</hi> and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that they that <hi>are not chastened, are not sons,</hi> and so<note place="margin">Vers. 6.</note> haue not God for their Father, I see not how the Apostle can speak of the creation of soules, seeing in that respect, wicked and godly, children and <hi>bastards,</hi> haue God alike their father. The <hi>Preacher,</hi> ch. 12. 7, speaks of the manner of the creation of the first man <hi>Adam</hi> onely: but no more proues that our soules or spirits are created by God imediately, then that our bodies are made of dust immediately. That ch. 8. 8, hath no colour of proof in it.</p>
               <p>Against our fourth and last assertion, that all by <hi>Adams</hi> sin are guilty of death, Rom. 5. 12, they cavill, that <hi>we were not in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 114. 115.</note> 
                  <hi>Adam to bring any soule to hell for the breach of that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, Thou shalt not eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where, first (to passe by their incongruity of speech) they free <hi>Adam</hi> himselfe from the guilt of condemnation of which our question is, as well as his posterity, by that his sin; seeing it brought not him himself to hell. But secondly, &amp; for the thing it selfe: They grant, acording to the Scriptures, that<note place="margin">Pag. 116.</note> 
                  <hi>death,</hi> as a part of <hi>the curse, came over all Adams posterity for his sin:</hi> And will they then deny, that eternall death was also due by the same law of justice? Is not the justice of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14749:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and so requiring infinite satisfaction? To what reasonable creature soever, the smallest punishment is due from God; the greatest is due also in rigour of justice. And so the <hi>curse</hi> (as they grant) <hi>extending to Adams genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 116<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>by his sin;</hi> eternall condemnation, as the principall part of it, extendeth unto them necessarily, except mercy be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
               <p>Neither will it help our Adversaries, that <hi>other creatures die</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 116. 122.</note> also; seeing their absolutely mortall condition limits their punishment to this present life: But such is not the estate of infants; but their immortall soules, unto which their bodies at that day are to be reunited, makes the whole capable of a more full declaration of Gods justice, if he deale in severity therof without mercy, as he may. Besides, the Apostle saith, that <hi>death passed upon all, for that all haue sinned, viz.</hi> in that<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>one man Adam.</hi> Doth death come over bruit beasts, because they haue sinned in <hi>Adam?</hi> They are brutish that see not the difference, which these men will not acknowledge. It is said else-where, that <hi>in Adam all die.</hi> Doe beasts die in <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 22</note> as his posterity doth? As all that <hi>are Christs,</hi> are <hi>in Christ,</hi> and <hi>made aliue by him;</hi> so all <hi>Adams</hi> posterity were in him, and die in him: Which <hi>death</hi> also the Apostle makes no lesse, then <hi>judgement to condemnation,</hi> to wit, if redemption be not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 16. 21. Pag. 117.</note> to which he opposeth <hi>justification, and eternall life.</hi> Ioyn herewith, these mens confession, <hi>that all mankind by Adams fall are made unable to keep Gods precepts, when he giues them, and so all fall under the wrath of God, and are therfore said to be children of wrath, Eph.</hi> 2. 3, and there is sufficient for their conviction, as hath been shewed. But I add, that the Apostle means plainly a further matter, and that all are born children of wrath: for to be so by nature, and to be born so, are the same. We are children of wrath by sin onely: If therefore all be children of wrath by nature, it is by the sin of nature, which we call originall sin, and not by actuall sin onely, as they surmise.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I demand whether, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not sinned, hee
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14749:74"/>
should not haue transferred to his posterity the Image of God after which he was created, and a pronenesse to keep it. (as notwithstanding sin, he doth some feeble remainders thereof)<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 14. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and therewith right to eternall life? If yea, why not then sin, and the guilt thereof, by proportion, having sinned?</p>
               <p>To Ezech. 18, I haue formerly answered. He speaks of the sins of immediate parents, not of the first sin of our first fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which was naturall: whereas the other but personall; yea, not onely other mens, but his after sins also. Secondly, it is plain, he speaks of such children, as <hi>seeing all their fathers sins, consider, and doe not the like, but doe that which is lawfull, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezeeh. 18. 14. 15, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>right, keeping, and doing all Gods statutes.</hi> To such God imputes no sin.</p>
               <p>Their affirmation following is strange, that <hi>Infants shall</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 118. 119.</note> 
                  <hi>receiv no judgment, because they haue done neither good nor evill, according to which all judgment passeth.</hi> By this, they should nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be saved, nor damned: for what else is it to receiv judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of salvation, but to be saved? and so for the contrarie. They doe ignorantly exclude Infants from a state one, or other, for wanting that condition, which is required of men of years onely. They might as probably say, that Infants shall be damned; seeing Christ saith, <hi>He that beleevs not shall bee</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 16. 16. 2 Thess. 3. 10.</note>

               </p>
               <p>To the place, Ps. 51. 5, <hi>Behold I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceiv me;</hi> they answer not directly, but by many <hi>Ifs, &amp; ands:</hi> chusing many uncertain vanities, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then one certain truth: which is, that <hi>David</hi> in this whole context confesseth his transgression and sin. And as men as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend by the stream to the fountain; so doth he in those words to the fountain of all evill. As if he should haue said; Lord, I am not onely stayned with, and guiltie of these particular evils; but I am even wholly corrupt by nature from the very womb, and haue brought a fountain of sin into the world with me, from whence these particular mischiefs haue issued.</p>

Then <hi>God making Adam of the dust</hi> made him unable to resist the Tempter also; which both crosseth the truth, and their own assertion. The Prophet, Psal. 103. 14, speaks of bodily weaknesse and frailtie onely, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to the matter in hand; and which, if it had been greater in <hi>David,</hi> would haue been more advantageable against that sin into which he fell.</p>
               <p>Next, for their advantage, they corrupt the Text, Rom. 8,<note place="margin">Pag. 119.</note> in saying, <hi>Christ came in sinfull flesh:</hi> where the Text saith, hee came <hi>in the similitude of sinfull flesh.</hi> He came in nothing sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but all holy, and pure from sin. So doe they that, 2 Cor. 5. 21, leaving out <hi>for us:</hi> which shewes, how Christ became <hi>sin for us:</hi> that is, as our Surety, and lyable to the curse due to our sinns; but not in sinfull flesh, as they erroneously say. Thirdly, they absurdly affirm, that <hi>the sin of his mother, whether Hevah, or that bare him, is that sin or punishment layd upon her,</hi> which he here <hi>confesseth,</hi> in saying, <hi>I was conceived in sin. David</hi> confesseth a sin as evill, wheras all punishments are Gods good work: yea his own sin onely of which he desires forgiuenesse. Neither doe the words here at all agree with those, Gen. 3. 16, as they say. The Reader that will, may see them opened at large by Mr. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

judging, followed the errour of the Pythagorean Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers: thirdly, where Christ is sayd <hi>to bear our sins,</hi> it is prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in regard of the guilt, as he was our Surety. Of what sin of his mother was <hi>David</hi> guilty?</p>
               <p>They unjustly accuse us, as saying, that <hi>David sinned in being</hi>

                  <hi>born and conceived;</hi> or that <hi>the very matter and substance wherof David was made, was sin.</hi> Vayn are they, in imagining such vain things of us. <hi>David</hi> was meerly a patient in being born, and sinned not therin; neither yet did his mother sin, either in conceiving or bearing him, though shee conceived and brought him forth in sin. But he having sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> as in a generall root, was so conceived and brought forth, by his mother, in sin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is one thing to <hi>be conceived and born in sin,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing <hi>to be made of sin.</hi> The former, <hi>David</hi> affirms of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; the latter, they vainly impute to us, and refute in us, with many words.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Infants are under condemnation;</hi> that is, naturally guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">Pag. 122. 123.</note> thereof, hath been formerly proved: that <hi>actuall faith in Christ</hi> is required <hi>for their reconciliation to God,</hi> doth not follow hereupon. Actuall, I say, for the seed of faith they haue, and of all graces: (for but by Gods holy Spirit in them, which carries all graces with it, they cannot be holy; and so not bee glorified, if they be not holy first:) but that hereupon they need actuall faith, is their saying, without proof. Actuall sins indeed require actuall faith: but for sin in disposit on (called originall) why may not faith in disposition suffice, through the mercy of God, for the applying of it?</p>
               <p>About the <hi>Infants of Sodom and Gomorrah,</hi> they discourse<note place="margin">Pag. 123.</note> marvellously, as first, in ranking them in their deaths with unreasonable creatures in theirs: secondly, in making them not onely <hi>innocent,</hi> but <hi>godly</hi> also.

               <p>THus they make Christ and Infants amends. But how proue they, that by Christs redemption they liue, moue, &amp;c? The Scripture Act. 17, to which they haue reference is meant of the naturall life of all, by Gods work of creation<note place="margin">Math. 10. 28. Hebr. 9. 26, &amp;c. Eph. 1. 6. 1 Tim. 2. 6.

The <hi>redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for which Christ came is <hi>from sin,</hi> and so from the curse due for sin, as the Scriptures every where testifie. <hi>The first Adam was made a living soule, the last Adam a quickning spirit.</hi> We haue therfore our naturall life, motion, and being (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Heathens with Christians) by the first <hi>Adam;</hi> our spirituall, and glorious life, by the second.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the Apostle saying, 1 Cor. 15. 22, <hi>In Christ shall all be made aliue,</hi> speaks onely of all beleevers, as is evident, v. 14. 17. 18. 19, who haue <hi>Christ</hi> for <hi>the first fruits,</hi> and are <hi>Christs,</hi> v. 20. 23.

                  <hi>haue the Son,</hi> they answer, <hi>by keeping his commandements;</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting faith, by which alone we <hi>receiv</hi> Christ: from which<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 12. 1 Tim. 1. 5.

               <p>It is true (being rightly understood) which they add, that<note place="margin">Pag. 127.</note> 
                  <hi>repentance is of all sin:</hi> to wit, particularly of all sins known; and generally of sins unknown. For, <hi>Who can understand his</hi>

Doe they think nothing amisse slips from them, in thought, word, or deed, or ever hath done, whereof they doe not, or haue not repented particularly? Is their knowledge so perfect as they need not pray for further <hi>enlightning,</hi> as Eph. 1. 17. 18?

                  <note place="margin">Pag. 128.</note> 
                  <hi>worshipped after a false manner,</hi> they expresly contradict the<note place="margin">2 Chr. 32. 17.</note> Scripture, saying, <hi>The people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the Lord their God onely.</hi> Here was worshipping the true God, and him onely, and yet after a false manner in a respect. The same the Apostle teacheth the Athenians, <hi>The God whom</hi>

                  <hi>you ignorantly worship, declare I unto you.</hi> When Papists direct their prayers to God, the maker of the world, and father of Iesus Christ, hoping the rather to be heard by means of the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> intercession, who doubts but they <hi>worship the</hi> true God, but in a false manner? Neither doth Deut. 18. 20, proue <hi>the sin one,</hi> of <hi>speaking in the name of a false God,</hi> and <hi>speaking falsehood in the name of a true God,</hi> but divers; though both deserving death.</p>
               <p>Next, they in their wilde order, come to treat of <hi>Faith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 128.</note>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:14749:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where they affirm, that <hi>no man can haue faith to justification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he haue repented.</hi> If they had sayd, that no man hath the grace or habit of faith before the grace of repentance, it had been true: (God, by the spirit of regeneration, infusing the habits of all graces at once:) But that the act and exercise of faith in beleeving, is before our repenting, appears both by Scripture and common sense. <hi>We liue the life of Christ</hi> (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20. Act. 15. 9. Rom. 4. 5.</note> our repenting is a part) <hi>by the faith of the Sonne of God. God purifieth the heart by faith:</hi> and <hi>justifies the ungodly by his faith.</hi> In all which it is plain, that faith hath the preheminence and first work. So 2 Cor. 7. 10, <hi>Godly sorrow workes repentance.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance then presupposeth godly sorrow. Godly sorrow, or whatsoever is truely godly, must needs <hi>please God, which without</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6. Rom. 14. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>faith no man can doe;</hi> but even <hi>every thing is sin.</hi> Faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which worketh repentance, must goe before it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, godly sorrow is not onely for the fear of punishment (for so the devils are sorrie) but for the offence of God spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. Now none can be sorrie for his offending God, except he loue God; nor loue him, except he know first that he bee loved of him in Christ, in which faith consisteth. We beleev therefore, before we repent, in the truth of the thing, and order of causes; though we can hardly discern this order in our own sense.</p>

               <hi>Murton,</hi> might be called <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi> Secondly, they err in saying, <hi>Baptism is repentance for the remission of sins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> goes before <hi>Baptism: Repentance</hi> is inward; the <hi>Baptism</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2. 38. 2 Tim. 2. 25</note> outward, of which our question is. <hi>God giues repentance;</hi> Men confer <hi>Baptism: Repentance</hi> is mans work; for it is man that repenteth by grace: Baptism (considered as inward) is Gods work; as outward, the Ministers under God. They affirm, p. 169, that the <hi>baptizing, or washing,</hi> of which we speak, is <hi>an action of the hand.</hi> Is <hi>repentance</hi> so with these men? Indeed that repentance upon which they rebaptize, is rather the work of their hands, then of Gods.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures alledged, pag. 129. 130, shew what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">Pag. 129. 130.</note> of men of years, before they be baptized: but are mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyed, as a bar, to the Infants of beleevers.

            <p>Their answer to the objection, pag. 130, is but the fencing of their own stroak.

The Gospell aymes not at the exacting upon man (as made after Gods own image) obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence due, as a naturall debt from the creature to the Creator, as the Law doth, but considers him as a most miserable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> drowned in sin, and altogether unable to help himselfe: neither yet servs it, and its Ordinances, primarily to declare and manifest, what man in right owes, and performs to God; but what God in mercy, purposeth, &amp; doth, and will perform to man: being <gap reason="foreign">

So, to apply this for the baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, albeit they on their part, can for the present, make no manifestation or declaration of obedience or thankfulnesse, or any other goodnesse: yet sufficeth it for Evangelicall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, that God, according to the Covenant of grace, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed,</hi> can and will make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation and declaration of his gracious minde of washing them, with the bloud and spirit of his Son, from the guilt and contagion of sin: they also, being bound in their times, to reciprocall duties. Let us not think scorn, as proud free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers doe, of Gods taking, both of us, and our infants, to be his people, going before our, or their taking of him to be our God: But let us rather magnifie his mercie in this regard, both towards us, and them.</p>

               <p>THE Apostle, Rom. 6, speaks not of regeneration it self, which is Gods work: but of our <hi>living to God,</hi> as an effect therof. For as our naturall life is an effect of our first genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or begetting by our parents: so is our spirituall life an effect of our regeneration by God, and his Word, and Spirit. Turning from sin is mans work, by Gods grace: Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Gods work, not mans. So for <hi>Repentance,</hi> they roav about it on all sides, but scarse touch the true nature of it. Repentance, to wit, Evangelicall, required for Baptism in men of years, is neither <hi>a sight, and knowing of sin by the Law,</hi> for that the wicked also doe: nor a <hi>confessing of sin,</hi> for that is outward, and follows repentance in the heart: nor a <hi>sorrow for sin,</hi> for that goes before it: nor <hi>a promise to forsake sin,</hi> for<note place="margin">

               <p>Now their argumentation in this place, that because Infants haue not faith, and repentance, to wit, actuall, and that in manifestation also (which are the conditions required in men of years for their Baptism, and the inseparable fruits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation) therefore they are not regenerate, and so not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Baptism, is, as if some idiot would affirm, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are not born, nor to be reputed reasonable creatures, nor endued with the faculties of understanding and reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14749:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they make no manifestation thereof, no more then bruits doe.</p>
               <p>Their proofs against the Regeneration of Infants thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, I manifest the contrary, as followeth.</p>
               <p>Christ the Lord teacheth, that <hi>except a man be born,</hi> or (as the<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> word more properly imports) <hi>begot again, hee cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods Kingdom.</hi> Either therfore regeneration is to be granted Infants, or Gods Kingdom to be denyed them. If any say, this is meant of men of years onely, the Text convinceth him; which opposeth the first birth, or generation, (which is of Infants) to the second regeneration: The first, as v. 6, being <hi>of the flesh,</hi> making them so born uncapable of Gods Kingdom, without the second, <hi>by the spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they confesse, else-where, that all, <hi>by Adams</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 123.</note> 
                  <hi>fall</hi> haue that <hi>weak flesh,</hi> Rom. 8. 3, <hi>by which they cannot keep the Law,</hi> &amp;c. Now I demand, whether Infants to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, carry this <hi>weak flesh,</hi> (hindring thus effectually true holinesse) into heaven with them, or no? If not, as is certain, then it must be purged out of their soules, and hearts, as the seat, and subject therof. But nothing can purge out that which is contrary to holinesse, saue the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of regeneration, which <hi>lusts against the flesh, and is contrary</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>unto it:</hi> either therfore they must be regenerated, or not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Scriptures teach, that by <hi>the spirit of Christ, which is the spirit of life for righteousnesse, dwelling in us, our bodies</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 10. 11. Pag. 123.</note>

               <p>Secondly, in saying, <hi>the promise is made to you, and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> hee speaks of some solemn promise made to them all, and the same to haue its fruit and effect in them, and their children with them, upon their repentance.

hee cals the Iews, which <hi>had denyed and killed the Lord of life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chapt. 3. 25</note> and not yet repented, as appears, v. 19, <hi>Children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and of the Covenant, which God made with the fathers:</hi> with which accords that, Act. 13. 32. 33.

               <p>HEre first, as commonly, they treasonably clip the Lords coyn in leaving out, for their advantage, <hi>to the beleeving husband, and to the beleeving wife.</hi> The Apostle saith simply, <hi>The children are holy;</hi> so saith he not simply, that the <hi>unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wife</hi> is holy; but <hi>holy to her beleeving husband;</hi> and the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving husband sanctified,</hi> or holy, <hi>to the beleeving wife:</hi> as<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 15.</note> all <hi>things are pure to the pure.</hi>

                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:14749:81"/>Now for the better clearing of this place, the Apostles drift is to be considered: which was to teach beleeving hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, that they might lawfully, and without scruple, keep, and converse with their unbeleeving wiues, (and so beleeving wiues with their unbeleeving husbands) as being sanctified to them, though not in themselvs. This he proues by an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken from their children, <hi>Else were your children unclean, but now are they holy:</hi> that is, if the beleeving husband might not lawfully retain his unbeleeving wife, then the children so born should be unholy: but they are holy. Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that he may lawfully keep and converse with her. This word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>else,</hi> or otherwise, ever includes in it a casuality: as Math. 18. 32, <hi>because thou desiredst me:</hi> &amp; ch. 27. 6, <hi>because it is the price of bloud.</hi> So 1 Cor. 5. 10, <hi>Else,</hi> or <hi>for then you must goe out of the world:</hi> As if he had said; seeing Christians are not to goe out of the world, but to liue in it, they may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eat with the fornicators of the world: So here, seeing your children thus born are not unclean, but holy; therfore you may and ought to retain your (though unbeleeving) wiues. The Apostle therfore making the children holy, and their holinesse a ground of the husbands lawfull keeping, and conversing with his wife, can haue respect to no other thing then the Covenant with <hi>Abraham, I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed;</hi> as a known and received ground by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, and all other Churches. This will yet be the more plain, if we bear in mind, that the question propounded to <hi>Paul</hi> by the beleeving Corinthians was, not whether they might keep their children or no, but their wiues. Hee had therfore no occasion of mentioning the children, as he doth, but to fetch from them an Argument for the retaining of the wiues. Now, if his meaning were, as they say, that <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were holy to the beleevers use, as the wife was,</hi> then he should haue argued from the holinesse of the wife, to proue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of the children: But thus he doth not, but the clean contrary. Besides, if the Apostle had argued as they would haue him, where had he laid the foundation of his proofe?
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14749:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Or how had he removed the scruple out of the Corinthians hearts?</p>
               <p>They add, that the <hi>Corinthians made no question of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> True; and that overthrows their exposition; as shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Apostle argues not from the wiues to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as they make him; but from the children to the wiues: Secondly, the Apostle disputes not from the Corinthians sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, or perswasion, but from the truth of the thing, the holinesse of their children. <hi>But now are</hi> (your children) <hi>holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They object, that these <hi>children must be holy, either as the beleeving, or unbeleeving part is holy.</hi> We say they are holy as the beleeving part, in regard of that foederall holinesse, and the spirit of regeneration. Then, say they, <hi>They are separated from common uses in which they were used, and are set now apart to Gods</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 137.</note> 
                  <hi>use.</hi> We say they are, as were the Infants in Israel, set apart, or severed, from the world, and taken into the number of Gods people. They themselvs affirm, a few lines before, that <hi>Israel was sanctified and set apart from common and prophane uses, to the service of God.</hi> And were not the Infants part of Israel, thus set apart, and sanctified? And yet could they not <hi>testifie any purity of heart,</hi> or other grace. That which in the very same period they build with one hand, they pull down with another. Secondly, if (as they say) Infants bee no otherwise sanctified, then to the use of others, and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers are, then can they not be saved: except the unholy can enter into Gods Kingdom.</p>
               <p>They object further, that <hi>then all the children of beleevers, though of age, and unbeleevers, should be holy also.</hi> But why ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy, then <hi>Innocent,</hi> which they will haue all Infants to be? By their <hi>unbelief,</hi> they are <hi>cut off</hi> from Gods Covenant, as the<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> Iews were, and from all holinesse therby.</p>
               <p>The next objection is ill framed, as they set it down; and<note place="margin">Pag. 138.</note> the answer worse. The errour in both is, that they consider not <hi>Iohns Baptism,</hi> and <hi>Christs</hi> according to their distinct parts; <hi>Iohns</hi> as outward, <hi>Christs</hi> as inward: <hi>Iohns</hi> outward Baptism,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14749:82"/>
and <hi>Christs</hi> outward Baptism were the same: for <hi>Christ</hi> was baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> thereby sanctifying Baptism to us, as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision to the Fathers by his being circumcised. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptism is not <hi>common to all,</hi> but peculiar to the elect: the outward, whether by <hi>Christ,</hi> or <hi>Iohn,</hi> is not <hi>peculiar to the elect onely,</hi> but common to others with them: witnesse <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> The outward Baptism by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and all other Ministers was, and is, onely <hi>with water,</hi> opposed to Christs, as the inward <hi>with the Holy Ghost.</hi> Which Baptism with the Holy Ghost, being understood of extraordinarie gifts, sometimes<note place="margin">Math. 3. Ioh. 1.</note> went before the other, as Act. 10. 47, but commonly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed upon it: But understood of ordinarie graces, did, or should, alwaies goe before it in right order of things.</p>
               <p>Next follows, 1 Cor. 10. 1. 2 &amp;c. <hi>The meaning of the H. Ghost</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 140.</note> herein they take upon them to <hi>explain</hi> to others, not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it themselvs, as is evident, in that they will haue this <hi>baptizing unto Moses in the clovd, and sea, &amp;c.</hi> to haue been onely for bodily deliverance, and the offer of Christ. But the Apostle looks upon those things with a more piercing and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eye: as appears, first in that, <hi>v. 1,</hi> he cals the Israelites indefinitely, his and the Corinthians <hi>fathers. Morever brethren I would not haue you ignorant, that all our fathers</hi> &amp;c. As if hee should haue said, Let not the children look for more privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg from punishment, if they sin, then their fathers haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. He therfore considers the Church of israel here, as in the state of a spirituall fatherhood to the Corinthians. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, hee expresly saith, that they were <hi>all baptized to Moses,</hi> and that the <hi>meat</hi> was <hi>spirituall</hi> which they <hi>eat,</hi> and <hi>the rock,</hi> or water, <hi>which they drank spirituall,</hi> even <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, to wit, sacramentally, and mystically. Thirdly, the Apostles ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that it may goe in full force, must thus be framed. They that are alike for substance in Gods benefits, shall alike be punished, if they sin alike: But you Corinthians now, and Israel of old were, and are alike in those spirituall benefites mentioned; Therefore, if you sin, as they did, you shall sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be punished, as they were. If the Apostle had propounded
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14749:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unto the Corinthians, the <hi>tokens of Gods loue and protection</hi> onely for bodily things, as they carnally conceiv, there had been no force in his reason against the security of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, especially occasioned by their enjoying the Lords Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Baptism, and the Supper as signes, and tokens of Gods loue for spirituall blessings in heavenly things. Might they not easily haue answered <hi>Paul,</hi> that the Israelites indeed might well perish, and be destroyed for such things as they practised, having onely Gods loue-tokens for bodily delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: but for them, they were better secured against danger, as having the tokens of Gods loue for spirituall and eternall deliverance, by the body and bloud-shed of Christ?</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, that <hi>all Pauls,</hi> and the <hi>Corinthians fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> being baptized with the Baptism signifying deliverance by Christ, and many of them being Infants, the Infants of Israel now are to be baptized also.</p>

Christs bloud, as the Corinthians did, in mysterie. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Apostles argument, as they put it, had been too blunt to haue peirced the Corinthians consciences; who might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily haue answered themselvs and him, that the Israelites in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had <hi>Christ</hi> in their time <hi>offered;</hi> but for themselvs they received him also, and so were better fenced against Gods plagues; yea, though they sinned, then the other were.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is neither true, which after they affirm, that <hi>Noahs Ark is called the figure of Baptism,</hi> but that <hi>the saving of eight soules by water</hi> (to wit bearing up <hi>the Ark) had Baptism, that now saveth</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for a like figure,</hi> or antitype: much lesse is it said, that <hi>Noah</hi> and his family were Baptized in the Ark, or water, as it is expresly said, that the <hi>Israelites were baptized in the cloud, and Sea.</hi> Every type of Baptism, is not Baptism, but hath onely something necessarily, which resembles it. But the more agreement there is, between <hi>Noahs Arke,</hi> and the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism now, the more firm Argument may be gathered for the baptizing of Infants. It is evident, that <hi>Noah through faith</hi>

                  <hi>THeir next answer to such Scriptures, as shew that</hi> whole housholds haue been baptized, and therefore Infants, as a part<note place="margin">Pag. 143.</note> of the houshold, is, that there are many housholds in which there are no infants; and that therefore except we proue such housholds to haue had Infants, it is nothing. <hi>Secondly, that</hi> it is most true,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14749:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that as the Apostles practised in one houshold, so they practised in all: <hi>and that therfore they</hi> baptizing in the laylors house such as beleeved, did not baptize infants.</p>

               <p>WEE grant, that the Apostles practise was the same, where there was the same reason: but as some Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies had in them infants, and some not; so all of years in some beleeved, and in some not: according to which diversity of persons, they administred Baptism diversly; and not alike in all housholds. Secondly, if these men would haue taken any sound course for the clearing of things, they should here haue given answer to such Scriptures, as else-where haue been<note place="margin">Relig.

               <p>TO the Scriptures record, that <hi>little children were brought to Christ, that he might lay his hands on them, and pray, or blesse them;</hi> and that wheras <hi>his Disciples would haue hindred them from him</hi> (even upon the same ground, without doubt, upon which these men excludes them) he being therewith <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, bids suffer them to come unto him, for that of such is the Kingdom of heaven; and takes them in his armes and blesseth them:</hi> and to our collection hence, they answer; first, that <hi>He saith</hi>

                  <hi>baptized them not:</hi> and lastly, that <hi>his blessings are manifold to Infants in their creation, life, and bodily benefits.</hi>

               <p>LET us examine the particulars: First, they presume, but cannot proue, that onely such are of the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as obey the Gospell. Shall Infants (which they affirm else-where) be <hi>glorified</hi> in the Kingdom of heaven, and yet<note place="margin">Pag. 123.</note> are they not of it? There are not two Kingdoms of heaven; but one, begun in grace, and perfected in glory. Secondly, they to make more colourable their erroneous construction of the Evangelists words, and Christs work about those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, cite for Math. 19, and the like places, Math. 18; that so the slight Readers, such as their Disciples are, might conceiv<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 14 Luk. 10. 13 &amp; chap. 18. 15.</note> that Christ had no other meaning in the other places by us alledged, then in that by them; and that he spake <hi>not of a child personally, but in condition, as David was,</hi> Ps. 131. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in that place, Christs meaning was to reprov the ambitious contentions amongst his Disciples, by the contrary disposition in a childe, which he therfore <hi>took, and set in the midst of them;</hi> but in the other, his purpose was to shew what interest the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Church had in him, and in his <hi>blessing,</hi> for which they were brought unto him by their parents. Against these depravers, both of the word, and work of God, I thus argue. That which the parents, which brought their infants desired, that the Lord did for them: But it is plain, that their desire in bringing them was, <hi>that he might pray for them, and blesse them,</hi> as the Scriptures expresly teach he did.</p>
               <p>But, say they, <hi>he baptized them not.</hi> True; for hee baptized none, though actuall beleevers. It sufficeth, that he did that<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 2.</note> by which he declared that they had right in him, and in his blessing, and that it was his will they should come unto him. Let them shew a way, how they can now come to Christ, saue by Baptism? Or how they can haue right in his blessing, and yet haue no right in his bloud-shed, and in Baptism, for the signifying and applying it?</p>

through <hi>the peaching of the Gospel, that they which are of faith might be blessed with faithfull Abraham.</hi> How preposterous are these mens waies, who will haue the seal so long before the Covenant?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Circumcision was the seal of that Covenant, by which <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his posterity became the Lords <hi>peculiar people, seperated</hi> from all the <hi>uncircumcised</hi> heathen unto him for his inheritance, and therein blessed: For <hi>blessed is the nation,</hi>

Saith not the scripture, that <hi>by the law all are accursed? and that as many, as are of the works of the law are accursed;</hi> as being unable to keep it? The Covenant then by which <hi>Israel</hi> became Gods people, and therein <hi>blessed,</hi> of which Circumcision was a sign, and seal, was not the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the law, but of the gospell, and so of grace, and salvation by grace.</p>
               <p>Lastly, how wyde, and wilde are they in expounding <hi>the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory</hi> of <hi>Abrahams two sons? Gal.</hi> 4 makeing <hi>Abrahams chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after the flesh, the Infants of the faithfull:</hi> never considering the Apostles generall scope, unto which the particulars are to be applyed.

               </p>
               <p>In adding, that <hi>the Old taught that Christ was not come in the flesh, nor into their hearts at their Circumcision:</hi> They make the Lords Covenant negatiue, as teaching what is not, and not what is. A Covenant is a promise upon condition; and a Testament, or Will, that, in which Legacies are given. But by this doctrine, here should be nothing either given or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised. It is, besides, very ungodlily said, that <hi>Abraham,</hi> (in whom principally we are to consider both of the Covenant, and seal thereof Circumcision) had not Christ in his heart, when he was circumcised. Both <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> historie, and the Apostles, who well understood it, affirm the contrary, and that he was <hi>justified in uncircumcision,</hi> by beleeving in Christ: In which respect he is called <hi>the father of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev,</hi>

whereof Circumcision was a seal, was the Covenant of the Gospell, and the same with ours now. It is strange that these men, who so magnifie Baptism, as they will haue men made Christians by it; should so vilifie Circumcision, as to make it of right to appertain to godlesse and wicked men: for such were and are all, at all times, since <hi>Adam</hi> sinned, that had, and and haue not Christ in their hearts.

                  <hi>birth,</hi> is meant the whole time of their fore-going misery. So, many hundred times, in the Scriptures, by <hi>the day,</hi> or <hi>that day,</hi> is meant indefinitely the time in which a thing happeneth, or is done. Besides, where the Prophet speaks of <hi>the day in which God took them by the hand;</hi> they speak of <hi>the day in which God appeared unto Moses, and commanded him to take them by the hand;</hi> which was, whilst he was <hi>in the land of Midian.</hi> God indeed then shewed his will to <hi>Moses,</hi> but <hi>stretched</hi> not <hi>out his hand</hi> for their deliverance, till many daies after.</p>
               <p>They say further, that <hi>Exod.</hi> 3, <hi>the Covenant is mentioned, I am the God thy father Abraham</hi> &amp;c. But is every mentioning of a Covenant, the making of it? And did God make a Covenant with, and become the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaak,</hi> and <hi>Iakob,</hi> at that time? That is, when they were now dead divers hundred years before. What can be more plain, then that the Lord doth not there make a new: but remembers the old Covenant made before with <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. of which the bringing his posterity out of <hi>Aegipt</hi> into the <hi>promised land,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 45. 13. 14. 15.</note> was an appurtenance? God promised to be <hi>Abrahams God,</hi> and the <hi>God of his Seed,</hi> that is, all-sufficient for the good things, not onely of this world, but also of the world to come, as Christ expounds his fathers words, Math. 22. 32. 33, and so gaue them accordingly the land of Canaan, as a store-house of earthly good things; and figure of heavenly. These men therfore, in this place, unskilfully transform the fulfilling of an old promise into the making of a new. Which they also confesse, in effect, in the very same place, in saying, that <hi>the promise</hi> (that is, the Covenant on Gods part) <hi>was made to Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>everlasting</hi> Gen. 17. I urge not further to proue the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> perpetuall; then as the nature of the same Covenant carries it.

                  <hi>make no covenant, nor agreement,</hi> is too childish to exclude them from it: and that, by which they should haue been in no covenant at all with the Lord, nor hee with them; new, nor old; Legall, nor Evangelicall: for they could make none.

               <p>Next comes to be examined that notable place, Rom. 4. 11. <hi>Abraham received the sign of Circumcision, the seal of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of the faith</hi> which he had <hi>being uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all that beleev<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though uncircumcised, that righteousnesse might be imputed to them also.</hi>

                  <hi>THeir evasion is, that by</hi> faith <hi>here, is</hi> not <hi>meant</hi> faith in the Messiah, by which he was, and we are justified: <hi>but, say they,</hi> Circumcision sealed up Abrahams fatherhood of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; <hi>that is,</hi> was a seal of his faith in beleeving God, that he should be the father of many Nations.</p>

               <head>DEFENCE.</head>
               <p>AND this faith, say we, was the faith of the Gospell, and faith in the Messiah, which the Apostle expresly saith, <hi>was imputed to him for righteousnesse,</hi> and by which he was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified; as is plain, from v. 17, <hi>I haue made thee a father of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations,</hi> compared with v. 22, where he infers therupon, even upon that faith, <hi>And therfore it was imputed to him for righteousnesse:</hi> Which also, that it was the same in substance with ours now, the words following manifest. <hi>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; but to us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we beleev in him that raised up Iesus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for our sins &amp;c.</hi> v. 23. 24. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:14749:90"/>This will yet the more clearly appear, if we consider what is meant by these promises, <hi>I haue made thee a father of many Nations, and so shall thy seed be,</hi> recited by the Apostle for the purpose in hand: In these words, <hi>I haue made thee a father of many Nations,</hi> he opposeth many Nations to that one Nation of the Iews. Of these many Nations, hee was <hi>the father,</hi> even <hi>of all that beleev,</hi> though uncircumcised, v. 11. And how a father? By way of example, that, as hee was justified by faith in the promise of God, and of the promised seed Christ, even when he was uncircumcised: So they, beleeving the same promise of God in Christ, now come of him, though uncircumcised, should in like manner, be justified as he was. Which is yet further confirmed, where it is said, that <hi>he is the father of all them, though not of the circumcision, that walk in the steps of the faith of Abraham, which he had yet being uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised.</hi> Whence I gather, that if we be justified by the same faith that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by, and that he was justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith in that promise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that then that promise was made of, and in the Messiah Christ, the blessed and blessing Seed: as it is said: <hi>So shall thy seed be: and Abraham beleeved, and</hi>

                  <hi>he counted it to him for righteousnesse:</hi> And again, <hi>In thee shall all Nations,</hi> or families <hi>of the earth be blessed.</hi> Now of this faith the Apostle here speaks, and of it he testifies <hi>circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> to haue been <hi>a seal to Abraham.</hi> It cannot be denyed, but that the Apostle in this whole discourse, speaks of <hi>faith to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification;</hi> proving partly, by the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and partly by the testimony of <hi>David,</hi> that we are <hi>justified by the faith of Christ,</hi> and <hi>not by the works of the Law.</hi> And to what end, or with what order should hee thrust in an impertinent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of any other faith? To affirm this, is no better then to defame the Holy Ghost with equivocating. Or to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose should he mention the <hi>sign of Circumcision,</hi> as a <hi>seal of faith,</hi> if not of that faith, of which he treats? For wheras it might be objected, that <hi>if Abraham were justified by beleeving before he was circumcised,</hi> as is said, v. 3. 9. 10, then what needed hee after to haue been circumcised? The Apostle answers, v. 11,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14749:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that hee <hi>received the sign of circumcision,</hi> as <hi>a seal of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of faith vvhich he had yet being uncircumcised,</hi> which <hi>faith</hi> v. 9, <hi>vvas reckoned to him for righteousnesse:</hi> that by it the covenant of grace between God &amp; him might be confirmed, as covenants among men formerly agreed upon are, by the seals thereunto annexed.</p>
               <p>Lastly, who endued with common sense, and modesty can deny, that by the <hi>righteousnesse of faith,</hi> wherof Circumcision was a seal, is meant the righteousnes which is by faith, as v. 3, <hi>Abraham beleeved God, and it vvas imputed to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi> and v. 9, <hi>faith vvas reckoned to Abraham for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi> which righteousnesse of faith, in this whole discourse, he opposeth to the righteousnesse of works by the Law, as is expresly to be seen, v. 3. 14. 15. 16.</p>
               <p>But now what say our Adversaries to these things? as men in a maze, and not knowing how to finde the way out, goe sometimes backward, sometimes forward, and sometimes leap unorderly from one place to another: so doe they in expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Scripture. In their out-leaps about <hi>Abrahams fleshly children,</hi> I shall not need heere to follow them. Where, after, they say, that <hi>Circumcision was a seal of Abrahams faith in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving God that he should be the father of many Nations,</hi> and <hi>that this was imputed to him for righteousnesse;</hi> they say as much as we<note place="margin">Pag. 151.</note> do, or desire they should. But where they say, in the very same place, that hee <hi>received not circumcision to seal up his faith in the Messiah,</hi> they goe backward most dangerously, to bring in a faith to justification, imputed for righteousnesse, which yet is not in the Messiah. Was righteousnesse ever, or is it imputed to any for justification, but by faith in Christ, then promised, now exhibited? The reason insinuated by them is a pleasant one; namely, for that <hi>Abraham had faith in the Messiah</hi> 24 <hi>years before he was circumcised.</hi> Whereas on the contrary, it could not haue been a seal of such faith, except hee had had the faith before, whether longer or lesser time, it matters not, but is, as it pleaseth him who bestow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>These things thus cleared, the Reader must be requested, not to measure our arguments from <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaaks</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, to the Baptism of Infants, by the crooked line which these men draw between them: but by the right rule of sound reason, applyed as followeth in three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>First, that the Covenant unto which Circumcision was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, was the Covenant of the Gospell, and not of the Law and old Testement, as they take it.

               <p>Secondly, we conclude hence, that the Church of the Iews, and Church now is one in substance, though diversly<note place="margin">Esay 5. 1. Ier 2. 21. Math. 21. 33. 34.</note> ordered: one <hi>Uineyard</hi> (in which there are both grown trees, and yong plants;) one <hi>Kingdom</hi> which <hi>was taken from</hi> them, and <hi>given</hi> to us; the <hi>branches</hi> of one <hi>oliue tree, holy</hi> in the same <hi>holy root Abraham, from which</hi> most of them were <hi>broken off for unbelief,</hi> and we <hi>by faith planted in their place; one body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 6.</note> and therefore having Infants in it now, as then, and the same therefore to be baptized (there being also <hi>one Baptism,</hi> as <hi>one</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 4. 5. Relig. Com. pag. 62. 63.</note> 
                  <hi>body</hi>) as they were circumcised of old: Baptism (as elsewhere I haue proved at large, to their silencing in that point) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the place of Circumcision.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that all their disputes against Infants Baptism, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot manifest faith and repentance, are but the same quarrels which might haue been picked of old against Infants Circumcision.</p>
               <p>That there was something in <hi>Abrahams circumcision</hi> extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, is true: for he first received it for his posterity; and for the Proselytes with them, which joyned themselvs to the Lord: so was there also in his <hi>faith,</hi> as he was <hi>the father</hi> (by example) to all that should beleev after him.</p>
               <p>Their prophane assertion, that <hi>faith was required of none</hi> (to<note place="margin">Pag. 152.</note> wit men of years) <hi>for circumcision,</hi> I haue formerly disproved. How can it come into the hearts of reasonable men, that the Lord in whose eies <hi>the prayers, sacrifices,</hi> and all other services of ungodly men were so abominable, should like of their circumcision?</p>
               <p>Lastly, for <hi>Abrahams children of the flesh</hi> (according to their misunderstanding of them) they were <hi>by nature children of wrath as well as others,</hi> and had thereby no more right to circumsion, then the Infants of Sodom. It was of grace, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14749:92"/>
not of nature, that they were within Gods Covenant. Of Gal. 3. and Rom. 9. we haue spoken at large formerly, and of their misconstructions of the Apostles meaning.</p>
               <p>Lastly, we neither <hi>run,</hi> as they say, nor goe <hi>to the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 153.</note> 
                  <hi>Law, or Moses for the baptizing of Infants;</hi> but to the Covenant of the Gospell solemnly made with our father <hi>Abraham</hi> long before the Law was given, the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment established, or <hi>Moses</hi> born.</p>
               <p>Their discourse about <hi>Rome</hi> is vain, except they can proue that the outward baptism there administred (though unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully) is not to be reteyned by such, as unto whom the Lord afterward vouchsafeth the inward baptism of his spirit; and so answer our Reasons to the contrary, which they haue, and haue had so long time in their hands.</p>
               <p>These things thus cleared, it remaines we come in the next &amp; last place to examine their defence of that their own unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed baptism in use amongst them: formerly proved by me a mere nullity by their grounds, and practise set together. Their ground is, that <hi>baptism unlawfully ministred is no bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> their practise, that <hi>he who ministring his gift</hi> (poorely as their manner is) <hi>doth convert</hi> (in truth pervert) <hi>another: may also baptize him without any speciall calling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For foundation of my proofs I laid down these two Rules. 1. <hi>There is no lawfull baptism, but by him that hath a lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to baptize.</hi> 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4. 5. And unto this they assent. 2. <hi>Onely he hath a lawfull ordinary calling to baptize (and extraordinary they challeng not) who is called therto by the Church.</hi> This their first rebaptizer Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had not, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue they, that now administer baptism amongst them; neither doe they account, that more is requisite for power, and right to baptize, then a personall gift of teaching, and making thereby one of their Proselites, and supposed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts. Whereupon it follows, that they themselvs being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by such, as want a lawfull calling, are not lawfully bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; and so by the verdict of their own quest, <hi>unbaptized persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:14749:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>Their defence they begin with the perverting both of my words, and meaning, very unhonestly, in setting down the state of the question; which yet seems not strang unto me, considering their licentious dealing in like sort, with the Holy Ghost in the Scriptures. They frame the question; <hi>whether any but Pastors or Elders may baptize?</hi> and my charge upon them; that <hi>they are unbaptized, because, they want Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But where haue I so spoken? or how gather they that to haue been my meaning? had it so been, why could I not as easily haue said, that none but Pastors (for of baptism by others <hi>Elders which labour not in the word and doctrine,</hi> we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> not) may lawfully baptize; as, that <hi>none but such as are lawfully called by the Church may baptize?</hi> which are my words. My meaning was not to deny, that a Church wanting Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors may appoint a member able to teach (though out of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice) to baptize: for which much may be said, and hath been by some so minded. Which though I doe not simply ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of; yet neyther did, neither had I occasion ro deal thereagainst, but onely against the wilde course of these All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alikes; of whom any that can wrest a few Scriptures (inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of men of yeares onely) against the baptizing of Infants, to the corrupting of some simple man, or woman, thinks himself another <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> as their practise and profession manifests. Now whether they haue thus altered my words, and perverted my meaning out of bold rashnes, as being more hasty to answer, then to understand their adversarie; or out of cunning for their advantage, the Lord and themselvs bee Iudges. Onely this any may see, and I shall make appeare, that the most, and most colourable of their Arguments are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their misconceaved, and not mine intended sense: which gives occasion to suspect, that they haue rather been cunning, then carelesse in the thing.</p>

                  </gap> to shew, that men are made Christian soules by baptism, as ignorant persons think and speak; but onely that they are confirmed, and furthered thereby in that which they were before. Some of the places joyn with baptism the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> others the <hi>laying on of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12 13. Heb. 6</note> 
                  <hi>hands</hi> (which yet rather is meant of <hi>the doctrine,</hi> then minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of those things). Now doe they conceaue, that such as were no true Christians before, are in part made Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and <hi>laying on of hands?</hi> When the Scriptures affirm any thing of an ordinance, they must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted according to the nature of the ordimance. As where Christ saith of the bread, <hi>This is my body;</hi> or of the rock, <hi>And the rock was Christ:</hi> or the Apostle here, that <hi>we are baptized into Christ, and draw neer unto Christ by baptism,</hi> and the like; we must understand the speaches as sacramentall, so far as they are applied to ordinances; that is, as intending those things, for signes, and seales, and means of confirmation; and not otherwise.</p>
               <p>Others of the Scriptures brought by them are so plainly against them, as it is marvail that in setting them down, they thought not of the Lords answer to the <hi>evill servant</hi> Luke 19.

22. For example, Math. 28. 19. <hi>Go teach,</hi> or as they well turn it, <hi>make all nations disciples baptizing them</hi> &amp;c. The Apostles then were first to make, to wit, by their teaching, <hi>disciples,</hi> that is <hi>Christians;</hi> and after to baptize them. Is it not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<note place="margin">Acts 11. 26</note> constant voice, and these mens plea (true in it self, but to a wrong end) that men must first <hi>beleeue,</hi> and <hi>repent,</hi> and upon manifestation thereof, be <hi>baptized?</hi> Are not they that beleev, and repent <hi>Christians</hi> with them? Otherwise, How doe they baptize them? But thus it is with men in all sects, that are lead by passion, and appetite, more then reason: they doatupon some one thing truly or apparantly good: and labor aboue measure, to magnifie it, esteeming all things without it, as nothing. Thus these men esteem of baptism, others of Church government, others of seperation, others of imposition of hands by Bishops; And so, according as men haue advantage by particulars, or suffer for them, or are otherwise prejudiced towards them, they set high valuation upon them. But as grace teacheth us to acknowledg better things in Christians then any outward ordinances; so must wisdom warn us not to ascribe too much to any one, as fond folks use to doe to the person, or thing which they affect.</p>
               <p>Math. 18. 20, is against them. To be <hi>gathered together in Christs name</hi> there, presupposes a Church state. So is Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And admit, it speak of the ordinance of baptism: yet must it follow rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, as a means of confirmation.</p>
               <p>As therefore Christians are not made by the ordinance of baptism; so much lesse are Churches. This I haue elswhere<note place="margin">Rel.

These they may answer, if they be able, as I am sure they are not: nor, I think, will ever goe

about it. Onely, I here add this one thing. If members, and Churches be made by Baptism, I demand, when <hi>I. M.</hi> alone baptiseth one of his converts alone, what Church, or member of what Church is here made? And if one alone may receiv or make members of the Church, why not also cast them out, and excommunicate them without the Churches presence or privity? Such is the confused course of these men.</p>
               <p>Here they cite sundry Scriptures, but proving onely that<note place="margin">Pag. 156.</note> which we willingly grant: <hi>viz.</hi> that men and women conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Heathenism, and Iudaism, to the faith of Christ, and so to be added to the Church, and being before unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, were to be baptized. But how proues this, that they were made either Churches or Christians by Baptism? When any of the Heathens <hi>became Iews,</hi> that is, embraced the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish<note place="margin">Esth. 8. 17. Nehem. 10. 28.

Or did it not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, declare and confirm that state of grace, in and unto which God had called them? Neither yet could the things fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned be performed by their infants: and yet were they made partakers of Circumcision with them.</p>

He that is not a Christian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be baptized, becomes not one thereby: But by the outward calling of the Church, hee that was no Minister be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, become such properly and imediatly. Secondly, a man is to be baptized but once: and God adding to the outward<note place="margin">2 Chron 30 18. 19. 20.</note> washing with water that which is inward, and by his spirit, sanctifies the former, and covers many faylings in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of administring it: but a man may on the contrary, upon occasion, be called divers times to a Ministery, in divers Churches, one after another. Thirdly, the Ministery is the<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 21 22. 23. &amp; ch. 12. 28.</note> Churches, and depends upon it as the adjunct upon the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, so as if the Church dissolue, the Ministerie ceaseth: which the same Church also that giues it, may take away, and make him that was a Minister no Minister: Besides, that in the mean while his Ministery is bounded within the precincts of that Church wherof he is an officer. But in the ordinance of Baptism the case is clean otherwise. For neither can the Church which hath given it, take it from him; neither cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth he to remain a baptized person, though alone, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Church, or other Christian in the world with him; neither is he in any Church where he comes, to bee barred from the priviledges of his Baptism, or use of any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon it.</p>

To my proofs they answer nothing at all, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their own tenent further, by any circumstance of the Text. Onely they tell us in the generall, that <hi>these things were written for our learning:</hi> We grant it, and therewith affirm, that amongst other things, we are to learn this from them; that such as are to baptize, are to be furnished with (besides, and aboue the gift of teaching) a speciall warrant and calling from Christ, either extraordinary and immediate, as had these <hi>disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and <hi>Ananias;</hi> or ordinary, and mediate by the Church: which alone is delegated by Christ the Lord, with authority to call men to the ministering of his solemn Ordinances; wherof Baptism is one, and not the use of a gift, as bare teaching is.</p>
               <p>In opening Math. 28, <hi>Goe teach all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. they shew<note place="margin">Pag. 102<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 163.</note> a strange streyn of wit; in gathering from thence, that <hi>any disciple of Christ may baptize,</hi> from whence all others of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or judgment (of all Sects) doe gather the contrary, and that none, but such as haue speciall calling to teach may bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize. Let us examine things particularly.</p>
               <p>And first, I affirm, that the Lord in that place giues an Apostolicall commission properly; which I thus proue. First, because he bids them <hi>Goe,</hi> or <hi>goe forth and teach all Nations:</hi> opposing the Apostles going forth, and teaching all Nations then, to the Prophets tarrying, and teaching that one Nation of the Iews formerly. Doe or can these men (though their <hi>feet abide not in the house, Prov.</hi> 7. 11,) goe to, and teach all Nations? Their answer is frivilous, that <hi>every Disciple is to doe this according to his best abilitie,</hi> seeing the Lord calls none to a state or work, but such as he furnisheth with answerable abilities. By such answers, the calling of any how unfit so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to any place or state how excellent soever, might be
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14749:97"/>
justified. Secondly, if not in this place, I would know when, and where Christ gaue the commission properly Apostolicall.</p>
               <p>Where they add, that <hi>the Apostles haue left their power whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behind them, and that nothing is dead but their persons:</hi> they erre not a little; For not onely their persons are dead, but their office also is ceased. If any now haue the power of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, they haue then the office of Apostles first, from which the power is, and in which it is to be exercised. If they <hi>say, they are Apostles;</hi> they <hi>are not,</hi> but are easily <hi>found lyars</hi> by plain direction of the Scriptures. Besides, they expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 1. 1 Cor. 1. 9. &amp; ch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. 9.</note> themselvs in the same place, in saying, <hi>The commission was given to such, as whose persons remains to the end of the world.</hi> If their <hi>persons be dead,</hi> how <hi>remain</hi> they? But they add, as their corner stone, that <hi>this commission was given to the succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Apostles in their doctrine from time to time, with whom Christ promiseth to be present alwaies, even to the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I should answer (as I know not but I might lawfully,) that these words of Christ, <hi>I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world,</hi> are to be expounded as those of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 1 Thess. 4. 15. 17, <hi>Wee which are aliue, and remain unto the comming of the Lord,</hi>  and that the meaning of both is, that all should so walk, as if that day of the Lord were to come every day of their liues, what would they reply?</p>
               <p>But admit this be spoken mediately to the successours of the Apostles (not in their power Apostolicall, for that ceaseth with their office Apostolicall, and their office with their persons; neither is there left in the Church any authority or direction for the chusing of Apostles, but) in the performance of such ordinary works, in lawfull order, as the Apostles were to exercise themselvs in, specially of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and baptizing, there mentioned: I thus proue, that by those successors are not meant, as they conceiv <hi>disciples,</hi> but such as haue speciall commission, and authority, and so speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Pastors.</p>
               <p>And first, Christ here opposeth them to whom he speaks, as the <hi>makers of Disciples</hi> (as the words are) to <hi>Disciples</hi> to be
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14749:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made by them. Secondly, if every disciple of Christ, then why not women also, which are disciples as well as men, and wherof there are diverse to be found better gifted then any of this fellowship? Neither can they object the Apostles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of women, 1 Cor. 11, &amp; 1 Tim. 2, seeing they hold Baptism no Church action, but personall onely; and so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister it as privately, as Midwines use to doe. Thirdly, if Pastors be most rightfully the Apostles successors in other works of their Apostolicall commission here given; by name, in administring the Lords Supper, and <hi>over-seeing the flock,</hi> and <hi>defending the same in the truth,</hi> which they grant: why not in teaching, and baptizing also, which alone are expressed?

               <p>BVT this they account a <hi>meer fiction,</hi> seeing <hi>converting and baptizing is no part of the Pastors office, which is to feed, watch and oversee the flock of Christ, and defend the same in the truth:</hi> then which they deny <hi>further charge to be laid upon him by his office:</hi> quoting for that purpose, Act. 20. 28, Tit. 1. 9, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding also to challenge it as an <hi>imagination,</hi> that <hi>he is to preach</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 163.</note> 
                  <hi>by vertue of his office:</hi> yea, adding that <hi>any disciple having abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is authorized, yea commanded to preach, convert, and baptize,</hi> as well, <hi>and as much, if not more, then any Pastour.</hi> To this height of usurpation are these <hi>Chorites</hi> come.</p>

               <head>DEFENCE.</head>
               <p>FIrst here, as alwaies, they alter the state of the question, which between them and me is not whether onely Pastors, but whether onely such as haue a speciall Church-calling, may baptize? Secondly, it is true, that Pastors in the right state of things, are not to be set over heards of goats and swine, but over flocks of sheep: yet doth it not follow thereupon that Pastors in no sort convert. For first, there may be in the Church hypocrites undetected, or after detection, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censured, which they may by Gods blessing effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14749:98"/>
Secondly, the Pastor as Pastor of the flock, and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, may convert a stranger comming in: and why then not baptize him by their own ground? The person so converted publiquely, may and ought to be baptized publiquely; and should not the Pastor doe it (by whom also hee is converted) rather then a private member? Thirdly, it is not all one (though they confound them) to convert, to wit, from being wicked to become godly, and to <hi>make a disciple.</hi> Children born in the Church may be made Disciples, yet not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; as it may be never having been such, as of whom it could be said, that they were wicked. Fourthly, it is their ignorance to make converting of men, and the baptizing them, actions of the same nature: seeing onely men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men before converted, and <hi>repenting,</hi> are to be baptized.<note place="margin">Act. 2. 38.</note> Lastly, in granting, according to the Scriptures, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor</hi>

                  <hi>is by office to feed the flock:</hi> they cannot deny, but that hee is to baptize thereby: seeing baptism is a part of that feeding properly, serving to confirm the faith of beleevers in the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of their sinnes by the bloud of Christ; <hi>Begetting is by the seed of the word, the word of truth:</hi> and so whatsoever means follow thereupon, is but for feeding and nourishing the so begotten.</p>

And how then belongs it not to Pastours, to whom these things belong, to convert? So where it is required that the <hi>Bishop</hi> (to be called) <hi>be apt to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>teach,</hi> is he not by his office to doe that which is requisite in him for his enabling unto it.

               <p>Ioyn with these the Apostles exhortation, that <hi>the Elders that rule well be had in double honour; specially they that labour in</hi>

                     </gap>. 11.</note> or <hi>Teacher</hi> by office should not teach and preach by office; that is, not exercise their <hi>office</hi> or ministery, <hi>the Teacher in teaching,</hi> and <hi>Exhorter,</hi> or Pastour <hi>in exhortation.</hi> And see we<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 5. 7. 8.</note> not here what new Patrons dumb ministers haue gotten; of whom the old almost every where are ashamed? If it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the Pastour to preach by his office, then though he never preach at all, yet it cannot be <hi>said to Archippus, fulfill thy</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 4. 17</note> 
                  <hi>ministery, which thou hast received in the Lord.</hi> The Pastour might, by their <hi>Canon,</hi> most faithfully perform and fulfill his office though he never preached one sermon all his life long.</p>
               <p>But as all errours haue some truth either in them, or nigh unto them, and so are raised upon mistaking of one thing for another, with which it hath some affinity: So is it in this case. For first the ability or gift to teach is not by the office, but before it, and meerly personall, and so remains even in the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:14749:99"/>
officer; and the same greater in one then in another, though the office be the same in both. Yet because the gift fits for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and enables to the performing of it many unskilfully confound them. Secondly, there is both a liberty, and duty of using the same gift in time &amp; place, before and without the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But herewith (the office concurring) is joyned, and added a bond of authority, and speciall charge upon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer to wait upon <hi>his office, the Teacher in teaching,</hi> the <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Pastor in exhortation,</hi> as the Apostle speaks.</p>
               <p>Here amongst sundry Scriptures, not so much as looking<note place="margin">Pag. 164.</note> towards the matter in hand, but speaking of the generall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of Christians, and graces of Christianity, common to women with men, and to such men as want all gifts of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with others, they alledg, 1 Cor. 14. 1, and the <hi>Apostle then commanding every beleever to covet to preach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But first, why put they <hi>preaching,</hi> and not <hi>prophesying,</hi> as the Text, and all translations haue it? Secondly, it is their presumption, that he speaks of every beleever. Was every beleever to <hi>covet spirituall gifts,</hi> to wit, all both extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and ordinary there mentioned? And are there not many in all Churches, who, without a miracle, cannot possibly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to any competent ability to teach publiquely in the Church? But let them stretch the words to their own size, what follows hereupon? All are to desire the gift of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, &amp;c. and such as haue it, to use it in time and place: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> it is not required of Pastors by vertue of their office to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort. Why not then thus? It is required of every member of the Church in his place, to watch for the good of the whole, and to defend the same against gain-sayers in the truth: and therfore it is an <hi>imagination,</hi> which these men in the page be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going affirm, that the <hi>Pastour is by his office to watch, and defend the flock against gain-sayers:</hi> Or thus. It concerns every<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 13</note> Christian, being able, to <hi>distribute to the necessities of the Saints,</hi> and therefore not to the Deacons by vertue of their office; which yet for the very thing are called <hi>Distributers</hi> in the same<note place="margin">Vers. 8.</note> place.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:14749:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and country against the enemy in his place and standing; and therefore by their consequence, not the Magistrate by vertue of his Magistracy. Their conclusion therefore, that a Pastor is not bound to teach by his office, because hee mightafter a sort, and in an order, teach without it; it is, as if they should tell us, that he who is bound to a post with one coard, cannot be bound with two.</p>

                  <hi>wherof they were made Over-seers by the Holy Ghost;</hi> and for their direction therin, propounding unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his own Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall example to be followed by them in so many particulars, shews who are the Apostles ordinarie successors in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall charges. The same also doth the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> in calling himselfe a <hi>Sympresbyter,</hi> or fellow-Elder with the ordinarie<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Elders.</hi> And truly what man, not at utter defyance with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, will denie that a Pastor in his charge is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly an Apostles successour, then a private brother.</p>
               <p>In answering mine exceptions, they build amisse upon my<note place="margin">Pag. 165. 166.</note> foundation, and father their bastards upon me: knowing that I both put, and haue proved against them, elsewhere, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>no Baptism,</hi> and <hi>Baptism unlawfully administred,</hi> in divers respects; and that the latter, though it ought not so to haue been administred, or received; yet ought not to be iterated; specially, if God haue added therunto the inward Baptism of the spirit of regeneration.</p>
               <p>Now my proofs, howsoever by them vilified, confirm,<note place="margin">1 Proof.</note> that besides and aboue the personall abilitie to teach, a <hi>speciall calling</hi> is requisite for him that dispenseth the ordinance of Baptism. This speciall calling ordinarie is by the Church, which alone hath Christs delegated power for Ordinances.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 21 22. 23. Math. 18. 17. 18. 19. 20.</note> The Argument I thus frame. That which by many proofs of Scripture appears to haue been done by speciall calling, and commission from Christ, and never otherwise; that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done by such speciall calling, and commission, is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done: But by the proofs by me brought, it appears that Baptism hath still been ministred by speciall calling, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,

and not otherwise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore, these mens Baptism not so administred, was, and is, unlawfully administred; and so they by their own grounds (which they vainly make mine) <hi>unbaptized persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither can they make an escape by saying, that they in<note place="margin">Pag. 166.</note> whom I instance had <hi>no calling by the Church, nor were Pastors of particular flocks:</hi> Seeing our question is not of Pastors, but of such as haue <hi>a Church-calling:</hi> and that <hi>Iohn Baptist, Christs disciples, Phillip,</hi> and the rest, had a calling extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, These Adversaries neither haue the former, nor chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the latter. And indeed, by this defence, so oft renewed by them, they make it evident to all the world, that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consider of their own practise seriously, nor of mine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
               <p>Of the difference between <hi>teaching</hi> and <hi>baptising,</hi> I shall speak in the fourth Rule: as I haue also formerly, both in this Treatise, and else-where, at large cleered their exception about <hi>ordination:</hi> which they cunningly dissemble. Here I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demand of them, whether one man alone, without either presence, or preceding election of the Church, may ordain a Pastor, as is their manner of baptizing. And for me, doe they not know in their consciences that I was ordained pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely upon the solemn calling of the Church, in which I serue, both in respect of the Ordainers, and Ordained? Whilst then they account me <hi>wilfully blinde</hi> in putting difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my <hi>Church ordination</hi> &amp; their Baptism; they shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs witlesly blinde in making them alike.</p>
               <p>To my proof, from Math. 3, that <hi>Christ in comming to Iohn</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 168.</note> 
                  <hi>to be baptized of him, fulfilled all righteousnesse,</hi> &amp;c. they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>That this is still done, when any disciple, &amp;c:</hi> Wherein first, they make both <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> disciples of Christ: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if Christ had herein considered <hi>Iohn</hi> as an ordinarie disciple onely, what needed he to haue come from one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to another, even from <hi>Galilee,</hi> to <hi>Iordan</hi> in <hi>Iudea,</hi> to haue been baptized of him?

baptized by <hi>Iohn, fulfilled all righteousnesse,</hi> in consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto us Baptism, as Circumcision to the fathers, in his own person, who <hi>of God is made unto us righteousnesse:</hi> and<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30</note> that by <hi>Iohns</hi> ministery, who had a most solemn and singular calling thereunto. Lastly, it is not likely, which they take for certain, that <hi>Iohn in these words, I had need to be baptized of thee, meant not</hi> (to wit at all) of <hi>the baptism with water,</hi> considering that the quest on between our Lord and him, was about that Baptism and none other. The words therefore insinuate, that some special state and calling is required in the Baptizer aboue these mens common disciple-ship.</p>
               <p>Heer first in answering Ioh. 1. 19. 25, for their own credite<note place="margin">3 Proof.</note> they disgrace <hi>the Priests and Levits, as blind and ignorant Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi> for <hi>demanding of Iohn, by what authority he baptized.</hi> But considering both their places, and <hi>Iohns</hi> practise in bringing a new ordinance of Religion into the Church, they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing herein not well sorting with their office.</p>
               <p>Secondly, their answer, that <hi>Iohn proovs his authority to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, by proving his authority to preach, from Esaias the Prophet:</hi> Esa. 40. 3, shews, how short their wits are in gageing the depth of the Scriptures. He doth not proue his authority to baptize, by a common authority or liberty to teach, which any of Israel (gifted) might use; but he justifies his whole mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, in all the parts of it, by his speciall calling, as the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger and fore-runner of Christ, plainly foretold by <hi>Esay</hi> and <hi>Malachy.</hi> Doe they think, that the Prophets words, <hi>The voyce of one crying in the wildernes,</hi>  appertained to every Israelite that could teach; as they ascribe power to baptize to each of their teaching disciples? Or might <hi>Iohn,</hi> without a special calling, haue instituted and brought into the Church, as he did, a new ordinance? Yea I would know, which of <hi>Iohns</hi> disciples ever offered to baptize? Of whom yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted, but divers were able to teach.</p>
               <p>As Cowards most vilifie in words, where in deed they dare<note place="margin">4 Proof. Pag. 169.</note> doe least, so doe these men account this proof <hi>most vain,</hi> against which they haue nothing to bring, saving an equivocation in

the word <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and a cunning course in leaving out that which I alledg from Rom. 12. 3, which would discover the fallacie. The different nature of <hi>baptism</hi> and <hi>teaching</hi> (meerly by a personall gift) is evident.

               <p>Their dispute from my former plea out of <hi>Mr. Perkins,</hi> that <hi>where God giues the word, he giues the power also,</hi> helps not: For first, both Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> and I, speak of a Church having<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Lastly, they most wrongfully accuse <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and me from him, as pleading for <hi>womens baptism:</hi> the Reader that pleaseth, may see the contrary.</p>
               <p>I doe not, as they here challenge me, in answering their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,<note place="margin">Pag. 172.</note> that because <hi>men, by vertue of their gift, without other calling, may doe the greater which is teaching,</hi> they <hi>may doe the lesse, which baptizing</hi> is: <hi>wrong</hi> them; as saying, <hi>having</hi> no <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> but no <hi>other calling but by their gift.</hi> If they haue any other calling, though not Pastorall, let them shew it; and so renounce their former plea raysed from their personall gifts alone.</p>
               <p>Their proof that <hi>he that may doe the greater may doe the lesse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 173.</note> is taken from Mathew 23. 16. 17. - 19. 20. &amp;c. Wherein they say, <hi>Christ proveth plainly, that either it was not lawfull for them to swear by the gold, and the offerings, which were lesser: or that it was lawfull for them to swear by the temple, and altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing lesse. It was lawfull to swear by none of them<note place="margin">Lev. 6. 13. &amp; 10. 20,</note> all, but by the Lord onely: The meaning of Christ was to reprove the hypocrisy and coveteousnes of the Pharisees, that bare the people in hand, that if they sware by the altar, and temple, it bound them not, at least, in comparison; but if they swore by the gold, or offering, that oath bound them to performance; that by this means, they might pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the peoples minds with an high opinion of the offrings, and gold, which turned to their proper advantage and profit. If from hence they would conclude any thing as lawfull from the greater to the lesse, they must argue thus. If it be lawfull to swear by the greater, then by the lesse much more: But it is lawfull to swear by the greater, and greatest, <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>that dwelleth in the temple:</hi> Therefore it is lawfull to swear by the temple, altar, sacrifice, heaven, earth, &amp;c. If they would be ashamed of this conclusion, so may they be of their argumentation.</p>

                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:14749:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>My plea for the power of calling ministers, and censuring<note place="margin">Pag. 174.</note> offenders by the Church where officers are wanting (which here again they bring in) is in their hand, like a sword in a childs hand, wherewith he sooner hurts himself, then his enemie. For (to let passe the difference between the power of receiving in, and casting out of members, and so of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of ministers, on the one side; and of baptizing on the other, elswhere manifested) they here strike thorow their own course, in confessing that these things must be done by the Churches power and right; by which they baptize not, but merely by a personall liberty: by which yet they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs, I suppose, would be loath to avow the calling of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and censuring of offenders.</p>
               <p>That my <hi>collection from Scripture</hi> is their conviction, &amp; <hi>makes</hi> plainly against their corner stone, that <hi>he which may doe the greater may doe the lesse,</hi> they may <hi>see,</hi> if they please to consider it. For if the Prophets in Israel (not being Levites) though preaching Gods word, might not carry the ashes from under the altar; but <hi>the Levites</hi> onely; then their rule holds not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, that he that may doe the greater, may doe the lesse; and so they must confesse, except they will deny the preaching of Gods word to be a greater thing then the carrying of the ashes out of the Temple.</p>
               <p>The former part of their first answer; that <hi>the preists onely</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 4. 13</note> (they should say the <hi>Levites) were appointed to this,</hi> makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, as shewing, that we are not to measure our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty or power by the greatnesse or smalnesse of the thing, but by Gods appoyntment, who hath allotted to every one his portion. Their second answer is of admirable devise, that <hi>as the preists might meddle with all the services of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; So all the saints being preists unto God (no men excepted) may meddle with all the services of the new Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why <hi>might,</hi> and <hi>may;</hi> and not <hi>ought,</hi> and <hi>must?</hi> The Preists under the Law were bound (leaving unto the high Preist his function, and to the Levites, theirs) in their courses, to all the services of the Tabernacle, and Temple

So by their crooked rule, every Christian (no men excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) not onely may, in liberty, but must in duty, minister not onely baptism but the Lords Supper also, and all other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, in his turn: and so all must be alike for publicke ministrations; for all are Preists to God alike. <hi>All the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi>

They err grosly therefore in making all <hi>Preists,</hi> for all publique ordinances in the Church: whereof some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayn to Christs Propheticall administration as the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are seales of the Covenant dispensed by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: others to his kingdom, as the appointing of officers, and censuring of offenders. Our Christian Preisthood stands onely in our offering of spirituall sacrifices to God, our selvs first, and so consequently the sacrifices of prayses, and prayer from a broken heart, works of mercy, and the like.</p>
               <p>That <hi>baptism</hi> is a <hi>service of the Temple,</hi> that is, an ordinance of the Church, we haue formerly proved: And surely strange it is, that I should need to proue, that there is any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of religion which the Church is not to administer. <hi>Paul and Apollos, and Cephas are</hi> the Churches, and is not their baptism theirs? This whilst they compare to the <hi>hewing of stones in the mountains,</hi> they lay in common for ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to very unbeleevers, with disciples: for <hi>the Zidonians,</hi> or other of the Heathens, as well as <hi>Israelites</hi> might either <hi>square</hi>

               <p>Lastly, touching my similitude. As it cannot be denyed, but that the setting of the seal unto the Kings pardon granted to a malefactour, is a matter both of more solemnity, and authority, then the bare manifestation and making known of the same pardon; which any, ordinarily, may do to any, as oportunity servs: So haue I proved long agoe against these Adversaries, by many Arguments, hitherto by them unanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and I assure my self unanswerable, that the outward bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, of which we speak, is an outward seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace: that is, an holy outward signe ordained of</p>
