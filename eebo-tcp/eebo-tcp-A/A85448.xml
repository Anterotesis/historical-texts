            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

reaſon why we celebrate the comming of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in ſo ſolemne, ſo ſacred, and ſo ſetled a manner, being gone and paſt 1600. yeares agoe? Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> hath given me an anſwer to my hand, <hi>Becauſe grace and truth came by Ieſus Chriſt, Ioh.</hi> 1. 17. When Jeſus Chriſt came from the boſome of his Father, he came not empty-handed, nor unprovided: but brought <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> into the world with him: <hi>Truth</hi> to direct us to heaven, and <hi>Grace</hi> to deliver us from hell: and that's a Congiary that deſerves commemoration to the worlds end. If any man ſhall yet further inquire, what is this <hi>Grace</hi> to us? or what are wee the better for the <hi>Grace</hi> that hee brought? For that my text will reſolve you, and make it evidently appeare unto you, that Chriſt is no niggard of his <hi>Grace,</hi> neither doth he keepe it to himſelfe (as <hi>Nabal</hi> did his victuals) but doth graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly impart it, and mercifully beſtow it, ſo much upon every one, as he ſeeth in his wiſdome to bee enough and ſufficient for him. <hi>My Grace is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee.</hi> And let that ſuffice for the occaſion and choyce of my text, that it is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unſutable and impertinent to the time.</p>
            <p>Come we now to the Text it ſelfe, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but <hi>The Oracle of God,</hi> or Gods owne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate voyce, not diſdaining to utter it ſelfe from Heaven, for the comfort and ſatisfaction of his poore diſtreſſed Suppliant here on earth. Fur thus ſtood the caſe.</p>
            <p>Our Apoſtle at this time was puniſhed with two ſtrange and ſtrong afflictions, the one internall, the other externall; the one he termeth the <hi>Thorne</hi> in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152661:4"/>
the fleſh, the other the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of Satan that buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted him. By that ſame <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Thorne</hi> or ſplinter in the fleſh. I ſuppoſe hee did meane his owne concupiſcence, his owne corruption and luſt, which is as painfull and vexatious to a tender ſoule, as a thorne in the hand, or a ſplinter under the nayle, is irkeſome and grievous to the tender fleſh. By that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the meſſenger, or the angell of Satan, muſt needs bee underſtood the Devils temptation; for before that wicked one come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hee ſends his Meſſenger or his Angell before him to make way for his entertainement, and as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> ſaid of the King of <hi>Iſraels</hi> man which was ſent to behead him, 2 <hi>Reg. 6. 32. Is not the ſound of his Maſters feet behinde him?</hi> ſo beleeve it, whenſoever an evill temptation, or a temptation to evill doth come before, the devill himſelfe who is the maſter and maker of it is not farre behinde. Now marke how this evill angell uſed, or rather abuſed S. <hi>Paul;</hi> the Text ſaith, He fell foule upon him, and buffeted him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now you know that buffeting is a malicious act joyned with violence, or a violent act joyned with malice, and it ſignifies unto us, what a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minde the Devill beares to Gods eſpeciall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; if he cannot by faire meanes entice, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, and inveagle them to ſinne; if God will give him leave, he will fall upon them by foule meanes, even <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to buffet them, and enforce them in a manner to ſin againſt God and their owne ſoules. Thus ſorely was our poore Apoſtle haunted, thus cruelly was he handled, both with venemous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions within, and with violent temptations
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152661:5"/>
without, ſo that neither inwardly, nor outwardly: hee could bee free or at liberty to enjoy himſelfe and his God: Whereupon (ſaith the Text) <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord thrice, that they might depart from him;</hi> all his deſire, all his prayer to God was, to be rid of theſe annoyances. Now marke the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and obſerve the <hi>Oracle</hi> of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>Juſt as ſome skilfull Phyſitian, when his Patient in a feaver calls for drinke, gives him a ſirrope, or ſome conſerve, and ſo quencheth his thirſt in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kinde, than drinke could doe: ſo dealt the Lord with <hi>Paul,</hi> who was now in a ſpirituall feaver, and cryes out amaine, (as it were for drinke) that is, for ſome preſent refreſhing, and releaſe of his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God ſeemes to take no notice of that, but quencheth his ſoules thirſt in a better kinde, gives him a ſpirituall conſerve, endues him with his <hi>Grace,</hi> and let that content thee (ſaith God) let that ſuffice thee; for that, even that alone is entirely enough and ſufficient for thee.</p>
            <q>My Grace is ſufficient for thee.</q>
            <p>From which paſſage of Gods providence (before I come to particulars) give me leave to commend unto you this briefe obſervation in generall: <hi>viz.</hi> That if after all our prayers, after all our entreaties and importunities with God for private and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular favours and mercies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for health in time of ſickneſſe, for eaſe in time of paine, for reſt and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in the time of trouble and affliction: Though God ſhould ſeeme to take no notice of us, but deny or with-hold all theſe things from us; if he doe but condeſcend unto us in this one thing (as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152661:5"/>
he did to Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) if he doe but vouchſafe us his <hi>Grace, Summam votorum attigimus,</hi> wee have as much as heart can wiſh, wee have that which is in ſtead, or in liew of all the reſt. As the Jewes write of their <hi>Mannah,</hi> that it had in it <hi>Omne dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctamentum,</hi> all manner of delightfull taſtes, and was in ſtead of bread, in ſtead of meate, in ſtead of all kindes of dainty fare; ſo may it truly bee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, that it is in ſtead of health, in ſtead of wealth, in ſtead of all other earthly bleſſings whatſoever: ſo that as a man that walkes in the Sunne, never lookes nor regards whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Moone or the Starres ſhine or no, becauſe he hath no need of their light: ſo hee that enjoyeth the light of Gods countenance, that hath the <hi>Grace</hi> of God to befriend and beſtead him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> needs care the leſſe for theſe inferiour commodities, theſe <hi>Bonae ſcabelli</hi> (as the Fathers call them) theſe goods of Gods Foot-ſtoole; becauſe, if he have them not, God will ſo provide he ſhall have no need of them. In a word then, if thou wert put to thy choiſe, as <hi>Salomon</hi> once was, to aske any one thing at the hands of God, and to have promiſe of acceptance, what ſhould that one thing be? wouldſt thou aske for riches, or pleaſure, or long life, &amp;c? Alas, all theſe things thou mayſt have, (as many a man hath had) and be never the holyer, never the happier, never the higher in Gods account and favour: Leave therefore all theſe things to Gods diſpoſall and diſpenſation; let God doe with thee for theſe things what ſeemeth good in his owne eyes: but pitch thou thy heart, and the deſire of thy ſoule
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152661:6"/>
upon that <hi>Vnicum neceſſarium,</hi> that one thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary (which our Saviour ſpeakes of) in compariſon whereof all other things in the world are needleſſe and ſuperfluous, I meane upon the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> and nothing elſe; and in thy daily prayers to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, let this evermore be the maine of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. <hi>Whatſoever thou denyeſt me for other things, Lord, grant me thy Grace, and it is ſufficient.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>My Grace is ſufficient for thee.</q>
            <p>Out of which words I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you foure remarkable points, perhaps not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy your obſervation. 1. The meaning of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>My Grace.</hi> 3. The efficacie or vertue of this <hi>Grace,</hi> what it profiteth, and whereunto it availeth, and thats expreſt in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is ſufficient; and therein I ſhall ſhew you, how, and wherein the ſufficiency of Gods Grace doth conſiſt. 4. The Application of this <hi>Grace,</hi> or the bringing of it home to the conſcience and ſoule of each belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſtian, and that I gather out of the laſt word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, or what is meant by the grace here ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>By the grace of God (in few words) I conceive to be meant nothing elſe but the favour and good will of God; that which the Schoolemen terme <hi>Complacentiam Dei,</hi> the well-pleaſedneſſe of God: the ſame which the Scripture calleth <hi>Lucem faciei, the light of Gods countenance, Pſal.</hi> 67. 1. Becauſe as God is ſaid to frowne and bend his browes upon the wicked traine, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. ſo on the contrary, hee ſeemes to ſmile (as it were) and to looke amiably and lovingly, and lightſomely upon all them that are in grace and favour with him. It is an uſuall expreſſion among us to ſay, ſuch a one is in great grace with the King, or in great grace at the Court, we meane, he is in great favour there. And it is a phraſe no leſſe uſuall in Scripture, <hi>Gen. 6. 8. Noah found grace in the ſight of God, i. e.</hi> hee found favour in his ſight; and God Almighty ſaith of <hi>Moſes Exod. 33. 12. Inveniſti gratiam coram me, Thou haſt found grace in my ſight, i. e.</hi> favour and good accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: And ſo the Angel greets the bleſſed Virgin, <hi>Luke 1. 28. Feare not Mary, Inveniſti gratiam, Thou haſt found grace, i. e.</hi> thou art highly favoured of the Lord. So that the grace of God, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God are (as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſaid of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dreames) both one and the ſame. Now the thing that I muſe upon is this, that the grace and favour of God is thus often, if not alwayes expreſt in the Bible, <hi>ſub termino inveniendi,</hi> under the name and terme of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152661:7"/>
finding: It is not barely ſaid of <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary, fuerunt,</hi> they were in grace and favour with God, but <hi>invenerunt,</hi> they found it: this phraſe doth certainely ſeeme to imply (as <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſter</hi> well obſerves) that the grace and favour of God is ſometimes found, as a poore man findes a treaſure, or a bag of gold, <hi>non induſtriâ, ſed caſu;</hi> not by any induſtry or paines-taking for it, but meerely by caſualty and Gods providence in it. As when <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren found their money in their ſackes mouthes, it inriched them, and it raviſhed them too, with wonder and admiration, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 28. in like manner, when a poore diſconſolate wretch, ſhall without all deſert, and beyond all expectation, finde a ſenſible experiment of Gods favourable goodneſſe towards him; how can hee chuſe, but even bleſſe himſelfe, and ſay, Lord, what am I that ſuch a favour ſhould be caſt upon me! In a word, as <hi>Iacob</hi> anſwered his aged father when hee queſtioned him about the matter of his veniſon, <hi>Gen. 27. 20. How is it that thou haſt found it ſo quickly my ſonne?</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Becauſe the Lord thy God brought it to my hand.</hi> In like ſort, if any ſhall ſeeme to queſtion the matter, how it comes to paſſe that ſome one man findeth favour and riſeth to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment ſo eaſily and ſo quickly over that ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe, which to our thinking deſerves it better, <hi>In promptu ratio,</hi> the Lord their God brings it to their hand: when God brings a bleſſing to hand, the labour is not long to finde it. But that by the way.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here take occaſion to reſolve you of two
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152661:7"/>
queſtions, which doe offer themſelves to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; the firſt is this, when a man wants the grace and favour of God, how ſhall he doe to finde it? the ſecond is like unto it, when a man hath found Gods grace and favour at his need, how ſhall hee doe to keepe it, that hee doe not forfeit it, nor looſe it againe? I will anſwer you for both, in a word.</p>
            <p>Doſt thou want the Grace of God, and faine wouldeſt finde it? Thou muſt doe two things for it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, thou muſt <hi>depreciari teipſum</hi> (it is <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> word) thou muſt diſparage and diſgrace, thou muſt humble and abaſe thy ſelfe before the face of God: for if that bee true which our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Ioh. 10. 35. non poteſt ſolvi ſcriptura,</hi> The Scripture cannot bee broken: then no man living can finde Grace with God, but he that is truely humble (for God reſiſteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble) Let one example ſerve for all, and it is a ſeaſonable one for this time: that of the bleſſed Virgin, of whom wee ſpake before: The Angel told her (as you have heard) that ſhee was <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152661:8"/>
               <hi>Iſrael?</hi> no doubt (as our Saviour ſaid in another caſe) <hi>many widdowes were in Iſrael in the dayes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizeus, but to none was the Prophet ſent, ſave onely to the widow of Sareptah:</hi> So, many Virgins were in <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the dayes of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> yet to none was the Angel ſent, but to her onely: And why to her, and not to them? ſhee that knew it beſt, gives the reaſon her ſelfe in her <hi>Magnificat</hi> which we daily read; <hi>My ſoule doth magnifie the Lord, and my ſpirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour;</hi> for why? <hi>Reſpexit humilitatem</hi> (ſaith ſhee) <hi>Hee hath regarded the lowlineſſe of his hand-maiden.</hi> It was not then for her lovelineſſe, but it was for her lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; not for her handſomeneſſe, but for her hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe that ſhe found ſuch grace and favour with God above her fellow Virgins: Other Virgins there might bee that were as chaſte as ſhee, as beautifull as ſhee, and farre more wealthy and gay then ſhe was; but no Virgin in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor in all the world, was ſo humble nor ſo lowly as ſhe was; and this was the onely <hi>materia ſtruendae miſericordiae,</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeake) the matter that Gods mercy had to worke upon; that, that onely, was the foundation and ground-worke of all the grace and favour that ſhe found with God. In like manner, if thou doſt deſire to bee partaker of the ſame mercy, to finde favour with God as ſhee did, thou muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be partaker of the ſame humility, thou muſt bee humble and lowly as ſhee was: doe as <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants did to <hi>Ahab, 1 Reg. 20. 31. We have heard</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that the Kings of Iſrael are mercifull kings, let us goe then and put ſackcloth upon our loynes, and</hi>

               <hi>ropes upon our heads, and ſo humble our ſelves before him, peradventure wee ſhall finde favour with him, that we ſhall not die but live:</hi> So thou haſt heard that the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a mercifull God, ſtand not then upon termes of eaſe or ſtate if thou loveſt thy ſelfe, but goe and humble thy ſelfe unto him, proſtrate thy ſelfe before him, pray and ſeeke his face in the lowlieſt, the dejectedſt, the devoteſt manner that poſſibly thou canſt expreſſe both with thy body and with thy ſoule, and (beleeve it for a truth) if any thing under heaven bring thee into favour with the God of Heaven, that will doe it, <hi>depreciare te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſum,</hi> to diſparage thy ſelf.</p>

God doe we ſerve, and what graceleſſe beaſts we are if wee ſerve him not, ſeeing hee hath grace ſufficient for all his ſervants? <hi>My Grace</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>is ſufficient for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word then, foraſmuch as all Grace is of God, that He, and none but He, hath the diſpoſall and the diſpenſation of it to whom hee pleaſeth; take (I beſeech you) into your conſideration theſe briefe advertiſements following.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Ne deficias,</hi> doe not faile of it; It is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles owne caveat, <hi>Heb. 12. 15. Looke diligently leaſt any man faile of the Grace of God.</hi> God for his part is ſo gracious, that he denyes his grace to none, but offers it, and (I may ſay) gives it to every one that will but aske and accept it, as the Scripture ſaith of <hi>Araunah, 2 Sam.</hi> 24. 23. when hee offered King <hi>David</hi> his Oxen for a ſacrifice, and his threſhing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for wood to burne them; the Text ſaith, <hi>All theſe things did Araunah as a King give unto the King:</hi> whereas we know, he did not give them, becauſe <hi>David</hi> would not accept of them, but his will was to have given them, and that the Holy Ghoſt accounts as a gift, and ſo recordeth it. In like ſort, God offers his grace in the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, his will is graciouſly and freely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it, if ſinfull men were but like-minded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and to make themſelves capable of ſo great a mercy by deſiring it. It was Gods owne propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to his owne Sonne, <hi>Pſal. 2. 8. poſtula a me,</hi> &amp;c. deſire of mee, and I will give thee the heathen for thy inheritance, &amp;c. If hee that was ſole Heyre of Heaven and Earth (<hi>haeres ex toto aſſe,</hi> as the <hi>Romans</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:152661:13"/>
uſed to ſtile them) could no otherwiſe come by his inheritance but by way of petition to deſire it afore he had it, much more ſo is it with us; where no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is, looke for no gift, no prayer, no grace. Wee ſee in <hi>Eſay,</hi> God makes a gracious promiſe to his people, that he would put away all their ſinnes, and take them all into his favor, as though they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinned; but marke the condition, <hi>for all theſe things I will be ſought unto</hi> (ſaith God.) So though God offer his Grace to men, hee will not force it upon them againſt their wills, hee will have them ſue for it, hee will have them deſire it, or they may thanke themſelves if they goe to hell without it; and God may juſtly complaine of them, as <hi>David</hi> did of <hi>Naball, 1 Sam. 25. 21. All is in vaine that I have done for theſe men.</hi> Seeing then there is no backwardneſſe in God to make deniall of his grace, but he is willing to beſtow it upon all that are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to imbrace it; Oh be not wanting to thy owne mercy, <hi>ne deficias,</hi> doe not faile of it.</p>
            <p>2. Seeing that Grace is the Lords, <hi>nè ſuperbias,</hi> be not proud of it, doe not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, (as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his word is, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 5.) doe not magnifically lift up thy ſelfe above thy brethren whoſe graces are not ſo eminent as thine: but rather as the eares of Corne, and the boughes of trees, the more they are laden with fruit, the lower they hang to the earth, ſo the more god hath laden thee with his graces and favours, be thou ſo much the more low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thy owne eyes; and thinke not ſcorne to doe as thy God does, who though his Glory bee above the Heavens, (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 113. 6.) yet hee
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152661:13"/>
doth <hi>Abaſe himſelfe to behold the things that are in the earth;</hi> and as the more direct the Sunne is over us, the ſhorter and leſſer is the ſhadow: ſo the more that Gods grace is over thee, and in thee, the leſſer let the ſhadow of pride bee ſeene to come from the: for conſider (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> or what is that thou canſt properly call thine owne, but <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacium &amp; peccatum,</hi> lying and ſinne? as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaid of the devill, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. when hee ſpeaketh a lye, hee ſpeaketh <hi>de ſuo,</hi> of his owne, God never put that into him: ſo for thy ſinnes thou muſt thank thy ſelfe, or rather indeed beſhrew and blame thy ſelfe, for they are thy owne; but if thou haſt any grace or any vertue in thee, thanke God for that; for it is not thine, it is the Lords: ſeeing then thou art but a Tributary to God, and haſt nothing that good is, but what thou art beholding, and muſt be countable to the Lord for it, <hi>nè ſuperbias,</hi> bee not proud of it.</p>
            <p>3. Seeing Grace is the Lords to beſtow on whom he pleaſeth, <hi>nè invideas,</hi> doe not envy it, let not thine eye be evill becauſe God is good, nor thinke the worſe of another man becauſe God is better to him then unto thee: for Gods grace is his owne, he may give it to whom he will. When God ſhall take off his grace, and of his good Spirit (as <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul</hi>) ſhall give it to a Neighbour of thine that is better then thou: what cauſe haſt thou to be envious at this? and not rather to humble thy ſelfe, and thinke that (as <hi>Daniel</hi> told the King, <hi>chap. 5. 27.) God hath weighed thee in a ballance, and found</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:152661:14"/>
thee, <hi>minus habens,</hi> wanting to God and to thy ſelfe, and therefore hath juſtly with-holden his favour from thee, and given it to one that will uſe it better, for his glory, and for the Churches good, farre be it from any child of God to cheriſh in his breaſt the ſpawne of that old ſerpent the Divell; for envy is no better; (as the learned have well obſerved) there is ſo neere a reſemblance betwixt an envious man and the Divell, that in the Booke of God the one is taken for the other; ſo the Divell is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, like the Angels of Heaven; who now at Chriſtmas time, when they ſaw that our Saviour would in no wiſe take their nature which was farre better then ours; but tooke our nature upon him, which was farre worſe then theirs, and which was moſt of all, and would have gone moſt againſt our ſtomackes, commanded them to worſhip it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6. they were ſo farre from envying, or taking of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at this; (as that elder brother did in the Goſpel, when the younger was received to grace after his riotous courſe) that even then they ſung an Anthem for the joy of our happineſſe, and even to this day; (Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12.) they doe <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152661:14"/>
let it bee thy practice evermore to reverence him that hath it, to judge thy ſelfe unworthy of it, ſeeke it in Gods name, and get to be partaker in it, but in any caſe <hi>ne invideas,</hi> doe not envy it.</p>
            <p>4. Seeing that Grace proceedes from ſo holy a Fountaine as is the Lord, <hi>ne Abutaris,</hi> doe not abuſe it, doe not vitiate nor ſtaine it with ſinne, as <hi>Lot</hi> entreated the men of <hi>Sodome, Gen.</hi> 19. 8. that they would not abuſe the Angels of God, ſeeing they were come to ſhelter themſelves under the ſhadow of his roofe; So let mee entreate you all in the Name of Chriſt that you would not abuſe the graces of God, ſeeing they are come from Heaven to take ſhelter and harbour in your breaſts and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes. The Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſome (<hi>Iud.</hi> 4.) that turne the grace of God into wantonneſſe; and that's a woefull kinde of Alchymie (as one ſaith ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well) would he not eſteeme that man prodigally fooliſh and mad, that would ſpend all his time, all his ſtubſtance, and all his induſtry to find out a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Philoſophers ſtone, that ſhould turne all the gold it touched into lead and droſſe? even ſuch are they that pervert the grace of God, and turne it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wantonneſſe, into laſciviouſneſſe, into all manner of ſcurrility and deboiſtneſſe, and never lin, till they have made a poyſon of an Antidote, and baned themſelves with that which would have beene their bliſſe, <hi>Lucerna Dei inſpiritu hominis</hi> (ſaith <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, Pro. 20. 27.) The ſpirit of a man is the candle of the Lord;</hi> it implyes, that a man naturally walkes in darkeneſſe, which is full of errour, and full of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, till God in mercy ſet up a candle in his ſoule,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152661:15"/>
(I meane) endues him with knowledge and grace from heaven, that he may ſhew him the path of life, and to avoid the ſnares of death.</p>
            <p>Now you know, that a candle naturally burnes upwards, if you take it and turne it the wrong way, and hold it downewards, it dyes and goes out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, ſo fares it with <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Graces and gifts of God, as Wit and Wiſdome, Knowledge and Learning, and all theſe are the candles of the Lord, and are purpoſely given us to light us up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venward; but if wee take Gods candles and hold them downeward, turne them the wrong way, and apply and abuſe them to ſinne; it is much to bee feared, the light of God will goe out, and thou ſhalt be left at the length in a place of utter darkeneſſe. Therefore as thou tendereſt the favour and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of God, and the eternall welfare of thy owne ſoule, deale not with the Graces of God, as <hi>Iehu</hi> dealt with <hi>Iehorams</hi> meſſenger, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 9. doe not turne them behinde thee, and make them ſerve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their owne maſters; but remember that if the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> would not endure to have their ſiſter abuſed (<hi>Gen. 24. ult.</hi>) how doſt thou thinke thy God will endure to have his grace abuſed, and to be proſtituted to every ſinne? In a word, as <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi> ſaid to his diſtreſſed brethren, (<hi>Gen. 42. 22.) did not I ſpeak unto you ſaying, Sin not againſt the child and ye would not heare?</hi> Oh bee not you like them, <hi>monitoribus aſperi,</hi> ſo careleſſe and regardleſſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine admonition; but remember that you have beene ſpoken unto, that you have beene warned of God not to ſinne againſt your owne ſoules in this

It is a thing that a man may leane his whole weight upon, and venture his whole eſtate upon, and pawne his life and ſoule upon, the certainety, the truth, and the infallibility of Gods heavenly grace to all that make their peace, and put their truſt in him. <hi>Feare not Mary</hi> (ſaid the bleſſed Angel to the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) <hi>for thou haſt found favour with God:</hi> as if he had ſaid, Let them feare that are out of Gods favour, let them be diſtruſtfull that are wicked and deceitfull, that make no conſcience of their wayes, but live in the diſpleaſure of an angry God; <hi>paveant illi,</hi> let them feare; but <hi>noli tu,</hi> feare not thou, be thou ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt &amp; unmoveable in thy affiance to God, for why? <hi>inveniſti gratiam,</hi> thou haſt found favour with him, in whoſe favour is life, and whoſe grace will bee thy guide unto the day of death.

In a word then, as our Saviour asked the Cripple, <hi>Iohn. 5. 6.

If therefore thou canſt not be ſo good as thou wouldſt, bee not aſhamed, bee not afraid to tell God how evill thou art; tell him how ungodly, how unthankfull, how unprofitable a ſervant thou haſt beene unto him, and deſire God to mend thee, and make thee ſuch a one as he would have thee: And as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea</hi> went to <hi>Pilate</hi> &amp; begged the body of <hi>Ieſus;</hi> ſo goe thou to God and begge the Spirit of <hi>Ieſus;</hi> even that <hi>ſpirit of grace and Supplication</hi> (which the Prophet ſpeakes of, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10.) which will come downe from heaven and bring into thy ſoule, firſt Supplications to prepare thee; ſecondly, Grace to aſſure thee of the free and full forgiveneſſe of all thy ſinnes: And then let thy ſinnes bee what they will bee, ſinnes of death, ſinnes of blood, ſinnes of hell; if thou canſt finde in thy heart to pray, God will finde in his heart to pardon, for his <hi>Grace is</hi>

Therefore the Apoſtle juſtly calleth him, <hi>The God of all conſolation, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. becauſe when all other comforts faile, there's comfort to bee found in God. For beleeve this for a truth, there is no mans caſe, no mans eſtate, no mans ſoule is deſperate to God; but when they are at the loweſt ebbe, at the

The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> obſerve that one and the ſame word (<hi>nakam</hi>) ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, firſt to repent, and then to comfort; and it may bee well applied to this purpoſe: that true comfort belongs to none but ſuch as are truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: ſo our Savior tels us that the holy Ghoſt whom he calls the Comforter when he commeth, the firſt thing he will doe, is to convince the world of ſinne; that is, firſt put men quite out of comfort in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then put them into comfort by their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.

Therefore in common ſpeech, when any outward malady doth befall us, where of we know no ſecond cauſe; wee uſe to ſay (and we ſay well) that it <hi>came by the Grace of God:</hi> now if thou beleeveſt that it came by Gods Grace, beleeve this alſo that by the ſame Grace it ſhall (in Gods good time) bee remedied, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and done away, for (as St. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother caſe) God giveth <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But then the maine point for ſatisfaction will be this: ſeeing it is in the power of Gods Grace to

cure all infirmities, and that in a moment, with a word-ſpeaking, (as the Centurion ſaid, <hi>Speake but the word, and my ſervant ſhall be whole.</hi>) Why will God ſuffer ſo many of his owne Patients, that have no Phyſitian but himſelfe, to lye languiſhing ſo long under his owne hand, and ſeeme to take no notice of their miſeries? The beſt anſwer I can give, is that of our Saviour to his Mother, <hi>Iohn 2. 4. Nondum venit hora, My houre is not yet come;</hi> for you muſt conceive there are two kindes of houres; wee have our houre, and God hath his Houre.

and then (and never till then) looke for a <hi>Tempus refrigerii,</hi> a time of refreſhing from the preſence of the Lord.

               </gap> an appointed time that God hath ſet downe with himſelfe in heaven, when and wherein his mercy ſhall appeare on earth for our recovery; and till that time we muſt wait, (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 123. 2.) As the eyes of a ſervant wait on the hand of their maſters, and the eyes of a mayden on the hand of her miſtreſſe, ſo doe our eyes waite upon the Lord our God, untill that he have mercy upon us.</hi> Marke that ſame <hi>donec miſereratur,</hi> untill hee have mercy: that is, though God ſhew thee not mercy, this day, nor to morrow, nor the next day, may bee, not till a long time after; yet, let not thy heart be diſmayed, but let thy ſoule truely wait upon God, untill hee ſhew thee mercy, let him ſhew it when he will. In the meane time know, thou art under the hands of a wiſe and gracious God, who meaſures every dram of ſorrow that thou feeleſt, who will not only be about thy bed, but will ever make all thy bed in thy ſickneſſe, and will ſo eſtabliſh and under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prop thee with his Grace; that though thy body lye in paine, thy ſoule ſhall lye at caſe; though thy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

If ever ſuch a dolefull time ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to thee, I pray God of his mercy looke graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon thee, and ſay unto thy bleeding ſoule, as he did once to that forlorne Infant, <hi>Ezech. 16. 6.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152661:20"/>
ſo the Grace of God bringeth ſalvation to every ſoule that entertaines it. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 5.

(Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bete ſalem in vobis, &amp;c.</hi> have Salt in your ſelves, and peace with one another) becauſe as Salt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the fleſh, ſo doth Grace preſerve the ſpirit from corruption and rottenneſſe in ſinne: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee meant of the Grace of God that is over and above us, I meane, his favour and loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which lightneth upon us from Heaven; (as we pray in our Liturgie, let thy mercy lighten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, as our truſt is in thee,) Take it either way, it holds good and true; for by the one we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for ſalvation, by the other ſalvation is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us; the Grace of God within us prepares us for ſalvation; the Grace of God over us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares ſalvation for us: ſo both wayes 'tis our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, <hi>By Grace to bee ſaved.</hi> It was Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull promiſe, <hi>Deut. 11. 12. Mine eyes ſhall bee upon this Land from the beginning of the yeare, to the end thereof;</hi> Such is Gods goodneſſe where hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes his Grace, ſuch a care hath God of their ſoules, that his eie is upon them from the beginning of their converſion, to the end of their ſalvation: and as his eye is upon them to watch over them, ſo his hand is with them to conduct them in the right way of pleaſing God, and of ſaving their own ſoules, <hi>Deut. 33. 3. All his Saints are in thy hand:</hi> as a Father leads his childe, ſo doth God lead his Saints by his Grace, and by his good Spirit, from
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:152661:21"/>
all things prejudiciall, to all things profitable, to his ſervice and their owne ſalvation. (To conclude this point) becauſe (as the Schoolemen ſay well) <hi>Ad ſingulos actus deſideratur Gratia,</hi> a man hath neede of Grace to every action that hee takes in hand, and that he can doe nothing well without it; let us all deſire of God (as it is in the Collect) <hi>That his ſpeciall Grace may evermore prevent and follow us,</hi> firſt, that God would prevent us with his Grace, to put into our hearts good motions, good thoughts, and good deſires; and ſecondly, that it may follow us too, (as the water of the Rocke followed the Campe of the Iſraelites to the Land of Promiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4.) ſo that Gods Grace may follow, accompany, and goe along with us in this world; and never leave us, never forſake us till it hath brought us to the end of our Faith, which is the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our ſoules, according to that, <hi>Pſal. 109. ult. Dominus ad dextram, &amp;c.</hi> the Lord is at the right hand of the poore, to ſave him from all them that would condemne his ſoule, where note that hee doth not ſay, the Lord is at their left hand (which is as I may terme it) the lazy hand, to ſave men in their negligent and idle courſes; But he is at their right hand (which is the working hand) to ſave all them that work for their ſalvation, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe the meanes to ſave themſelves: which thing if thou make a conſcience to doe, though thy ſinnes and thy enemies ſhould conſpire to condemn thee, Thy God and his Grace will be ſufficient to ſave thee.</p>
            <p>And ſo at length, I am come aboard the laſt and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152661:21"/>
long deſired part of my Text, which containes the application of all in particular, which hath beene ſpoken and delivered in generall; drawne out of the word (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> ſo that, as it is ſaid of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 45. that his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was ſo punctuall, and clapt ſo cloſe to the conſciences of his Auditors, that the Phariſes knew he meant them: So by that time I have done with my Text, (neither will I bee long in doing it) I truſt you ſhall perceive that Gods meaning was to you, when he ſpake to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and told him that <hi>His Grace is ſufficient for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briefly then, ſee what <hi>Paul</hi> was, and ſay what thou art; if your caſe be the ſame, your comfort is the ſame; for God is no accepter of perſons, his Grace is as ſufficient for the one, as for the other.</p>
            <p>1. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>Homo in Chriſto,</hi> he was a man in Chriſt, as you may ſee by the ſecond verſe of this chapter (<hi>I knew a man in Chriſt, that was taken up into the third Heaven:</hi>) Art thou ſuch a one? I meane, art thou regenerate and become a new creature? (for he that is in Chriſt is a new creature. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17.) doſt thou daily renew thy repentance, and renew thy obedience, and renew thy duty and devotion to God? And is it a griefe to thy ſoule, that ſo much of the old leaven, thy old corruption remaines ſtill in thy heart? Then take this holy Scripture to thy comfort, and aſſure thy ſelfe, though thy conſcience diſquiet thee; Gods Grace will be ſufficient for thee: contrarily, if thou beeſt an old weather-beaten ſinner, an old ruſty drunkard, ſwearer, and that ſtandeſt at a ſtay, and gathereſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152661:22"/>
ſinne, like an old tree that ſtands and gathers moſſe; I muſt ſay unto thee (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Simon Magus, Act.</hi> 8.) thou haſt neither part nor portion in this priviledge; thou art not a man in Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently canſt claime no intereſt in the Grace and favour of God.</p>
            <p>2. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>Homo in Cruce,</hi> a man upon the croſſe, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. I am crucified with Chriſt;</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 24. I fill up that which is behind of the ſufferings of Chriſt in my fleſh: whereupon (ſaith a Father) <hi>quid deeſt paſsioni Chriſti, niſi ut nos ſimilia patiamur,</hi> what is, or what can be wanting to the ſufferings of Chriſt, but that as he tooke up his Croſſe, ſo wee take up ours and follow him: for <hi>Vae portantibus crucem, &amp; non ſequentibus Chriſtum,</hi> woe to them that are crucified, and not with Chriſt; that beare the Croſſe, and follow not Chriſt, but turne from him cleane another way. It is well knowne that afflictions goe under the name of croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; now a Croſſe was a piece of wood for a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour to dye on, there was no other uſe of a croſſe but that: Affliction therefore is called a croſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhould have the nature and power of a Croſſe, that is, it ſhould be a meanes to crucifie and mortifie all carnall luſts and affections in us; that the more we are afflicted, the more wee ſhould dye to ſinne, and the leſſe life and power ſhould our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions have in us. Thus it was with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> is it ſo with thee? doſt thou wiſh and deſire the death of thy ſinnes? doſt thou make this uſe of thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, even to die daily? (as the Apoſtles ſpeakes) doſt thou every day drive one naile into the body
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:152661:22"/>
of ſinne, I meane one ſigh or groane to God againſt it? doſt thou labour to draw blood of thy ſoule (as they drew blood of thy Saviour) I meane, the teares of true repentance? and is it a death to thy heart, that thou canſt not dye unto ſinne, and live unto God, as thou ſhouldeſt and oughteſt to doe? Then looke no further for Heartſ-eaſe, but to the words of my Text, and aſſure thy ſelfe, what ever Croſſes be upon thee, Gods Grace (in Gods good time) ſhall bee ſufficient to caſe thee. Contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if thou beeſt one that doſt <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>3. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>Homo in negotiis,</hi> a laborious man, a man full of imployments, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 10. I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured more then all my fellow-Apoſtles</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>yet not I, but the Grace of God which was with mee.</hi> (there's an honeſt acknowledgement by whom hee profited.)

hook to the line, from the line to the goad, from the goad to the arme, from the arme to the body of the fiſher, and ſo benum him, &amp; take away al uſe and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his limbes: His meaning is, that he was none of thoſe idle drones, that by their lazineſſe and lewdneſſe doe even chill, and benumme, and dead the charity of well-diſpoſed people; but as he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in preaching, ſo hee wrought in his calling too; and put himſelfe to any paines, rather then bee chargeable or burthenſome to any friend or ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and by this meanes it came to paſſe, that what he wanted at home, he found it abroad; and Gods grace that was with him did ever ſupply him with that which was enough and ſufficient for him. Is it ſo with thee? Thou that art a poore man, art thou alſo an induſtrious and a painfull man? that as <hi>Iacob</hi> got the bleſſing in the garment of <hi>Eſau,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, <hi>Working;</hi> ſo doſt thou work and take paines to get the bleſſing of thy God? doſt thou labour with thy hands the thing that is good, that thou mayeſt rather bee charitable, then chargeable to him that needeth? and will not thy honeſt labour maintaine thee, nor ſuffice the charge that daily lyes upon thee? Take comfort by this Text that now is taught thee, and let not thy wants nor thy neceſſities diſmay thee, for there is a God above that hath ſufficient for thee; contrarily, if thou beeſt one that live in pleaſure (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of that widdow, <gap reason="foreign">

Non aliter in eccleſias quantumvis remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas affectus, quam ſi illas humeris geſtaret</hi> (as <hi>Beza</hi> ſaid of <hi>Calvin</hi>) hee was no leſſe tenderly affected for thoſe Churches that were remote and farre off than if hee had borne them upon his owne ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and carried them (as Nurſes do their Babes) in his owne boſome.

               <hi>children</hi> (as he calls them, <hi>Gal. 4. 20.) Of whom he travelled in birth till Chriſt was formed in them.</hi> His care was greater for them, than either for himſelfe, or any others; and he gives his reaſon <gap reason="foreign">

I will give thee the ſame counſell that I deſire of God to take my ſelfe, and that's this, <hi>Cognoviſti Gratiam Dei,</hi> (ſaith our Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 6.)

Revertere ad requiem,</hi> Returne unto thy reſt, O my ſoule, then ſettle and aſſure and reſolve thy ſelfe, that Heaven ſhall want mercy, and earth meanes, before any of thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods protection and patronage ſhall want maintenance. Never bee in doubt what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them, knowing that <hi>His Grace is ſufficient for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might adde hereunto many particulars; as that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>homo in vinculis,</hi> a man in bonds, but
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:152661:25"/>
the <hi>Grace</hi> of God unlooſed them all: that he was <hi>Homo in neceſsitatibus,</hi> a man in wants, but the <hi>Grace</hi> of God ſupplyed them all: that he was <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo in periculis,</hi> a man in many perills and dangers, but by the Grace of God he eſcaped them all: that he was <hi>Homo in tentationibus,</hi> a man mightily trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with temptations, but by the Grace of God he overcame them all: All theſe I purpoſely overſlip (which perhaps might comply with many a mans condition, and conduce to his comfort) but there is one behind that is of greater value than all the reſt, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was, as I pray God of his mercy make me and thee, and every Chriſtian ſoule to be.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Homo in Coeleſtibus,</hi> a man of an heavenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; though his bodily abode was upon earth, yet his <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, his ſoules commerce, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was in heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. no marvell then, that being ſo much acquainted with God, as hee was; and ſo converſant in heaven, which is <hi>Gremium Gratiae,</hi> the lap and boſome of Grace; if, as tis ſaid of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> that leaning in the boſome of Chriſt, he thence ſuckt out his heavenly knowledge; So St. <hi>Paul</hi> being ſo intimate, and ſo entire with God who is the God of all Grace (whatever elſe hee wanted) could not poſſibly want Grace ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for him. In a word then: Is it ſo with thee though in a farre inferiour degree? Art thou, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Chriſtian is, and ought to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152661:25"/>
heaven? doth thy heart ſtand Heaven-ward? Art thou bound for that coaſt? (as <hi>Paul</hi> went bound in the ſpirit to <hi>Ieruſalem, Act.</hi> 20.) I meane, doſt thou ſet thy affections upon things above, upon God and his Grace? and not on things below, upon the world and her goods which drowne mens ſoules in perdition? Art thou one of that ſame <hi>Generis Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lini,</hi> of that Eagle kinde, whereof our Saviour ſpeakes, <hi>Mat. 24. (where the body is, thither will the Eagles reſort</hi>) the body of thy Saviour thou knoweſt is in Heaven, and doth thy ſoule reſort often thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? doſt thou wiſh (as <hi>Macarius</hi> did) <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that thy ſoule might goe up into heaven with thy prayers, and there abide for ever with God? Then, what <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid to <hi>David</hi> in a caſe of conviction, I dare apply to thee in a caſe of comfort; <hi>Thou art the man</hi> whom God delighteth to favour: and therefore as the Patriarchs are ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, even to kiſſe and embrace the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Chriſt: ſo doe thou even claſpe and hugge this promiſe of Grace to thy ſelfe; and let neither thy wants, nor thy weakneſſes diſmay thee, for both in life and death thou ſhalt finde Gods Grace to bee ſufficient for thee, which God of his mercy grant unto us all, &amp;c. <hi>Amen.</hi>
