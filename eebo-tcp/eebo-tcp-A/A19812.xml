            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VPon the second agreement (the

of a disproportion of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie)
betweene the <hi>Triumuiti
Octauius Caesar, Marcus Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
and <hi>Lepidus: Octauia</hi> the
sister of <hi>Octauius Caesar,</hi> was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to <hi>Antonius,</hi> as a linke to combine that which
neuer yet, the greatest strength of nature, or anie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of nearest respect could long hold togither, who
made but the instrument of others endes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered

met not with that integritie she brought:
but as highly preferred to affliction encountred with
all the greeuances that beat vpon the misery of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
exposed to stand betwixt the diuers tending
humours of vnquiet parties. For <hi>Antonie</hi> hauing yet
vpon him the fetters of AEgipt, layde on by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of a most incomparable beauty, could admit no new
lawes into the state of his affection, or dispose of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
being not himselfe, but as hauing his heart tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Eastward whither the point of his desires were
directed, toucht with the strongest allurements that
ambition, and a licencious soueraintie could draw a
man vnto: could not truly descend to the priuate loue
<pb facs="tcp:9777:4"/>
of a ciuill nurtred. Matrone, whose entertainment
bounded with modesty and the nature of her educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
knew not to cloth her affections in any other colours
then the plain habit of truth: wherein she euer suted al

to win the good liking of him that helde her but as a
Curtaine drawne betweene him and <hi>Octauius</hi> to sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
his other purposes withall; which the sharpe sight of
an equally iealous ambition could soone pierce into, &amp;
as easily looke thorow and ouer bloud and nature as he
to abuse it: And therefore to preuent his aspiring, he
armes his forces either to reduce <hi>Antonie</hi> to the ranke
of his estate, or else to disranke him out of state and al.

so forgot himselfe, that he quite put off his owne nature,
and wholy became a pray to his pleasures, as if hee had
