            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>PRaiſed and Glorified be, for
evermore one ſole God<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, Alha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liq, Alha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</note>,
and Creator of all things,
whoſe Reign is without beginning,
and without middle, as well as
without end. The Being from
whence proceeds all Beings: The
firſt and only cauſe that ſubſiſts of
it ſelf, and gives motion to all
others, which it cauſes to act
through incomprehenſible Reſorts,
moving as it pleaſes, the Hearts
of all Men, and particularly that
<pb facs="tcp:39314:3"/>
of Kings; to accompliſh by them,
as ſecond cauſes upon Earth, what
Providence has reſolv'd on from
all Eternity in Heaven; who pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
him that merits it by his
Juſtice, and predeſtines whomever
he pleaſes by his Mercy, ſeeing
written together, and of one and
the ſame date, the paſt, preſent and
future, in the great Book of his
infinite knowledge.</p>
            <p>To this great God do I make my
humble Addreſſes, to obtain the
force I ſhall need to write exactly
and truly,<note n="*" place="margin">In Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſch,</hi> that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, <hi>Majah,</hi> Invention, by reaſon he has done it without any forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> 
               <hi>The Hiſtory of the
Conqueſt of Spain,</hi> and the
Wars occaſion'd by the Death of
<hi>Caliph Aboulvalid Almanzor,</hi>
not only in that great Kingdom,
but in <hi>Africa,</hi> and throughout
the whole extent of the <hi>Arabians:</hi>
firſt of all among the Princes his
Children, and afterwards among
<pb facs="tcp:39314:3"/>
the Governours of all his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
who after having revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ev
againſt their King, wag'd War
upon one another, about the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of that great Empire. As I
will add nothing of my ſelf to ſuch
great events, ſave ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
matters as occurr'd in thoſe
times; I neither expect nor merit
Honour or Profit: I only require
of him that ſhall read what I am
going to write, that he would pray
God to teach me what I ought to
do for his ſervice; and that he
would ſupply what is not in me by
his Grace: And indeed I am well
aſſur'd of being blam'd for having
undertaken ſo vaſt a deſign, and
that ſeveral will find (as it is true)
that it required both more lofty
and more poliſh'd Genuiſſes than
mine,<note place="margin">In Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick <hi>Each meallalhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> to give the neceſſary Weight
and Authority to ſo great a Work.
<pb facs="tcp:39314:4"/>
But after having agreed with them
in this, they will allow me to tell
them the Reaſons that made me
take Pen in Hand; and perhaps,
they will be ſatisfy'd when I ſhall
tell them that I was preſent in
that War, from the firſt day that
General <hi>Tariff</hi> entred <hi>Spain</hi> with
Count <hi>Julian,</hi> until that he had
finiſh'd that Conqueſt; and that
there was no Battel nor Occaſion,
but whereat I was in Perſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
the Sieges of <hi>Carmona,</hi>
and of <hi>Merida;</hi> by reaſon that at
that time, I was in the Province
of <hi>Grenada,</hi> with that great
Captain.</p>
            <p>Thus I may ſay, that I have
been an Eye-witneſs of moſt of the
things whereof I ſpeak; and that
as for thoſe I have not ſeen in all
times, I have had the Curioſity to
be informed of them from Perſons
<pb facs="tcp:39314:4"/>
who could know them better; as
from the Principal Officers and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
of Armies, who have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
given me the Letters and
Memoires whereof I make mention
in this Hiſtory, that I might be
accordingly provided for the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it one time or other.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I may hope that thoſe
as ſhall take the pains to read it,
inſtead of Wondering at my Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
will con me thanks for my
<note n="*" place="margin">Ni acha mila, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</hi>
               </note> Good Will, and will have ſome
indulgence for the faults as ſhall
doubtleſs, in great numbers occur
therein, when they ſhall conſider
that there is no Body in the World
exempt from them, and that we
ought to mind our own, before we
judge of thoſe of others; nay, ſome
there will be that will find there
would have been much more reaſon
to have blam'd me, had I not made
<pb facs="tcp:39314:5"/>
any Memoires of all I had ſeen,
than to have made them ſuch as
they are; and the greateſt Criticks
will be oblig'd to own, That if all
Authors that undertake to write
Hiſtory, had like me, had ſome
part in the Events they deſcribe,
their Works would be much better
receiv'd by the Publick, and not
be, as they are, for the moſt part,
full of Falſities and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainties.</p>
            <p>I make no Difficulty to ſpeak in
this manner, for as at the very
moment that I write theſe great
things, there are ſtill People of
that time, that, as well as me,
have ſeen the greateſt part of them,
and who can give me the lye, if I
do not relate them according as they
paſs'd? I ſhall content my ſelf with
taking them to witneſs of the
truth; and I willingly ſubmit my
ſelf to their Cenſure.</p>

PUBLISHER
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>SInce the Novelty of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the Form of this
enſuing Hiſtory, do poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſomething to be ſaid for
its better Illuſtration, I ſhall a
little ſtreſs upon thy Patience,
Gracious Reader, by ſo modiſh
a Tranſgreſſion as that of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.
A man ſeldom arrives
at a Delicate Entertainment
without running the Gauntlet
of a bundance of Formality;
ſeldom gets to Court without
<pb facs="tcp:39314:6"/>
ſtanding the Brunt of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Ceremony; nor to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of a Miſtreſs without
bruſhing through a Confounded
deal of VVooing and Riffling:
And yet without being an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
Ambitious, or a Lover;
if the Scene be new, whatever
trouble it may have coſt him,
he finds his ſatisfaction. Now
this is matter to urge for my
Excuſe in the preſent inſtance:
For undoubtedly, hardly has
there ever been ſuch very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Occurrences and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
in the VVorld as thoſe
here deſcribed, and yet with
which we are leſs acquainted:
Thus the Learned, as well as
others, will have wherewithal to
gratify their Curioſity, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
their Knowledge. This
is abundantly made out by the
<pb facs="tcp:39314:6"/>
Tranſlator, in the Diſſertation he
had annnex'd: But he going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France</hi> this Summer, and
leaving his Copy with a Friend,
that Friend handed it to the
Preſs; and it was agreed it
would make the Compleater
Book, were the Diſſertation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
to the ſecond and laſt
Volume; though it proves the
Truth of this Hiſtory, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
it with the Hiſtory of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Arabian,
Turkiſh,</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Manuſcripts.
His abſence muſt at the ſame
time Apologize for ſome, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
unpoliſh'd paſſages,
which he would have refined
had they paſs'd his Review;
which poſſibly, ſo far from being
Blemiſhes, like Moles, rather
heighten the Beauty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:39314:7"/>
But bating ſuch ſmall ſlips,
what can be of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
than an account both of
one of the greateſt and leaſt
known Heroes that was ever
in the VVorld, as was that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Arabian</hi> Monarch <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor;</hi>
who after having taken
<hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and Conquer'd the
greateſt part of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the
<hi>Indies,</hi> render'd himſelf Maſter
of all <hi>Africa</hi> that was known
at that time; and whoſe Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
having reduc'd <hi>Spain</hi> in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to him, could hardly
curb themſelves from paſſing
the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> and undertaking
the Conqueſt of <hi>France,</hi> before
they had received orders from
their Maſter for that purpoſe.
Yet do not our Hiſtorians ſo
much as agree upon this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Princes Name, of the time
<pb facs="tcp:39314:7"/>
when he Reigned, nor of the
Year when the <hi>Moors</hi> paſs'd the
Streight.</p>
            <p>But the Principal cauſe of
our little acquaintance with this,
and other the Hiſtories of the
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> Princes, is the Ignorance
of the <hi>Arabick, Perſian, Turkiſh,</hi>
and <hi>Mauritanick</hi> Languages,
which hinders us from being
ſo Critical as to know the good,
from bad Books, written in
thoſe Tongues; and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
there is, not only in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
them aright, but in
reading them alſo aright; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch,
that after many Years

by conſequence<note n="*" place="margin">

after his Death, and which had
been only conferr'd upon him until the
Majority of his Nephew. But he was
loath to reſign ſo precious a Pledge,
and his thoughts were wholly taken

the whole Authority to himſelf;
which to him did not ſeem ſufficiently
Charming, as long as it was only bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd.</p>
               <p>The more his Nephew became for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd

he had much ado to diſſemble.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Anagilda</hi> having ſooner than
any other, perceiv'd the ill will he bore
her Son, ſeldom ſuffer'd him out of her
ſight, and only plac'd ſuch perſons
about him, as of whoſe fidelity ſhe was
well aſſur'd. But, in ſhort, the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſhe had for <hi>Don Sancho</hi> making
her ſhrift into all <hi>Rodrigo</hi>'s pernicious
Deſigns, and to foreſee the ſtorm that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39314:15"/>
was ſuddenly like to come pouring
upon her Head; ſhe ask'd <hi>Rodrigo</hi>'s
Permiſſion to leave <hi>Toledo,</hi> the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Abode of the Kings of <hi>Caſtille,</hi>
to retire to a City in <hi>Andalouſia,</hi>
called <hi>Cordoua,</hi> whither ſhe took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
her Son, and all her Houſhold.
This Reſolution, which <hi>Rodrigo</hi> durſt
not thwart, made him harbour new
and ſtronger Diſtruſts: He every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
fancy'd that his Nephew had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to his years of Majority; that
the Scepter was to be put into his

was, become his Subjects<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Alcabir,</hi> ſubmitted, ſubjected.</note> Pupil: And
looking on this fall as a thing worſe
than Death, he found no better means
to ſcreen himſelf from it, than to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
as ſoon as poſſible <hi>Don Sancho</hi> out
of the World.</p>
               <p>To bring this Deſign the more eaſily

to be proclaim'd at <hi>Toledo;</hi> where
ſeveral days were wholly ſpent in the
Preparations for ſo great an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And as all People were invited
to be there on the day it was to begin,
he ſent a Courier on purpoſe to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doua,</hi>
earneſtly to entreat Queen <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilda</hi>
to Honour it with her Preſence,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39314:16"/>
and with that of the Prince her Son.
This Princeſs ever labouring under the

preſs'd by the Meſſengers that were ſent
upon the heels of one another, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
thoſe in whom ſhe thought ſhe
might confide: They all agreed, That the
Diffidence ſhe harbour'd of her Brother-in-Law
was well grounded, but that it
became her not to ſuffer it to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd:
That <hi>Rodrigo</hi> wou'd eaſily gueſs
the Reaſon why the Prince went not

for which they ought not to

                  <hi>Rodrigo</hi> in the mean while, thinking
he had taken his meaſures aright, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
himſelf with the hopes of ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeeing that Priſoner arrive, whom he
had ſo great a longing to rid himſelf
of; but ſtrangely was he ſurpriz'd,
when he ſaw his dear <hi>Aſtolpho</hi> come
all disfigur'd as he was, diſclaiming
againſt, and curſing his ill fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
He was much more ſo, when having
ask'd him, Who had put him into that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39314:21"/>
condition? He acquainted him how
that having taken <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> and
bringing him along towards <hi>Toledo,</hi>
the Queen his Mother iſſued out of
<hi>Cordoua,</hi> with abundance of Horſe and
Foot, and had us'd ſuch expedition,
that ſhe had overtaken him on the
way, had cut all his Party to pieces,
whatever reſiſtance he had been able to
make, to endeavour to hinder her from
reſcuing his Priſoner from him; and
that ſhe would, doubtleſs, have put
him to Death as well as the reſt, had
ſhe not thought fit to reſerve him to
carry him this Letter; which he did
not expect would be over welcome:
The King, after having taken it, ask'd
what was become of <hi>Anagilda</hi> and her
Son? And he having reply'd, That
they had taken Shipping for <hi>Africa;</hi>
he was ſo ſorely griev'd, that his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
had like to have made him run
mad. He went and ſhut himſelf up in
his Cloſet, that he might ſo with the
more freedom give a looſe to the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had for the unhappy event of
his Enterprize. He could not then
forbear opening the Queens Letter;
and as Truth has great force, he felt
in that moment ſome Repentance for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39314:22"/>
what he had done. But Ambition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ruling Paſſion of his Soul<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Faqr,</hi> Mind, thought.</note>,
the remorſe of his Conſcience did not
trouble him ſo much, as the fear he
had leſt <hi>Anagilda</hi> ſhould go demand
ſuccours of the <hi>Moors</hi> againſt him. This
made him ſend in all haſte for Count
<hi>Julian,</hi> to whom belong'd the Caſtle
of the <hi>Algeſires,</hi> where ſhe had reſided
for ſome time before ſhe went into
<hi>Africa,</hi> that he might by him diſcover
the intention of her Journey into thoſe
parts. This Count being come to
Court, and having aſſured the King,
that ſhe went away with a Reſolution
to prevail with the <hi>Moors</hi> to wage War
upon him, he reſolv'd to ſend this
Count into <hi>Africa,</hi> to endeavour to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
this Storm; and to procure the
better welcom for his Letters to <hi>Muca,</hi>
who was then Vice-roy for the <hi>Caliph
Valid-Almanzor,</hi> he accompany'd them
with a world of Preſents<note n="*" place="margin">

him the offer of entring into a Treaty
of Alliance with his Maſter. <hi>Anagilda</hi>
in the mean while falling ſick, through
Grief rather than fatigue, was oblig'd
to ſtay for for ſome time at a City of
<hi>Africa</hi> call'd <hi>Tangier;</hi> by which means
Count <hi>Julian</hi> had ſeen the Vice-roy,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39314:22"/>
and preſented him with the Jewels ſent
him by <hi>Rodrigo,</hi> before he had heard
talk of her. <hi>Muca</hi> receiv'd him with
much Honour; and after having treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him ſeveral times in a Houſe he had
caus'd to be prepar'd for that purpoſe,
he made him anſwer, That he could
not of his own head reſolve upon any
thing of what <hi>Rodrigo</hi> required; but
that if he would ſtay ſome time, he
would write to the Caliph <hi>Almanzor,</hi>
who would, undoubtedly, receive in
due manner the advances of ſo great a
King; and would do all that ſhould
be moſt fitting, and moſt ſuitable for
both.</p>
               <p>During theſe Tranſactions, <hi>Rodrigo</hi>
receiv'd Tydings, that <hi>Anagilda</hi> and
<hi>D. Sancho</hi> were both dead at <hi>Tangier;</hi>
which inſpir'd him with mighty Joy,
ſeeing himſelf at the point he had ſo
long wiſh'd to be at; and believing he
had now nothing more at all to fear.
He nevertheleſs imagin'd that the Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Moors</hi> might be of ſome uſe to
him: For which reaſon, he wrote to
Count <hi>Julian,</hi> that notwithſtanding the
Prince's Death, he ſhould nevertheleſs
remain in <hi>Africa,</hi> to wait the event of
his Embaſſy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:39314:23"/>
After having taken theſe Precautions
for abroad, his thoughts were now only
bent how to ſecure all things at home,
where were ſtill ſome Princes that
might diſpute the Crown with him.
He caus'd the States to be held at <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi>
where, <hi>D. Sancho</hi>'s Death being
made known, he caus'd an Oath of
Allegiance to be taken to him by all
the Grandees there aſſembled, as <hi>Don
Sancho</hi>'s Lawful Succeſſor to the Crown.
He had likewiſe his Coronation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
in great Ceremony, and with
all the rejoycing that is wont to be us'd
in ſuch like ſolemnities. But in the
midſt of all this Joy, could not he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain
from labouring under ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet;
and to free himſelf wholly from
it, and to put himſelf into a poſture
that he ſhould not need to dread any

any of his Subjects, the only People he
imagin'd he needed to fear, having

propitious, we ought not to expect that
it will ſo long continue: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
as it has not any ſtability; and
that it is inconſtancy it ſelf; the more
it ſmiles upon us, the more ought we
to diſtruſt it; and often expect that
ſhe delights to invite us, by ſmall baits
and allurements, to run after her, to
abandon us afterwards, when we ſhall
ſtand moſt in need of her ſuccours.</p>
               <p>Of this there can be no greater, nor
a more illuſtrious Example found than
<hi>Rodrigo:</hi> For after having render'd him
abſolute Maſter of all <hi>Spain,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:39314:24"/>
him to be Crown'd King thereof;
ſhe took a pleaſure in<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fram,</hi> loſs, deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the Root. <hi>Saram</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.</note> deſpoyling him
in a ſhort time, of all ſhe had conferr'd on
him, and tumbled him from his Throne,
by the ſame means he pretended to
make uſe of to defend himſelf on it.</p>
               <p>Such of his Subjects as he moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted
(for he had no longer any
Apprehenſion from Strangers) were
ſome Grandees, and Governours of
the Places of <hi>Andalouſia,</hi> and of <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
who had been of <hi>D. Sancho</hi>'s Party.
Wherefore he began to make ſure of
their Perſons; and after having put
them to Death, he caus'd not only
their Caſtles to be raz'd, but moſt of
the ſtrong Places of <hi>Spain;</hi> reſerving
to himſelf only ſuch as ſeem'd to him
moſt neceſſary for his own ſecurity;
wherein he put ſuch men as were
wholly at his Devotion. He did not
think this ſufficient; He caus'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
to be made through all his
Territories, That not any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
henceforwards ſhould have the
boldneſs to bear any ſort of Arms, nor
to keep any in his Houſe; and that all
People ſhould bring them into his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
upon pain of Death; imagining
that after the People had thus laid aſide
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:39314:24"/>
the Exerciſe<note n="*" place="margin">Alchiad.</note> of War, and ſhould only
addict themſelves to Agriculture, his
Government would be much more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,
and much more quiet.</p>
               <p>But the poor Prince was much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
for not being then curb'd by
any fear, he abandon'd himſelf to all
manner of Irregularities and Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
according as I have been told by
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops, and other perſons wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Credit, of whom I made enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
during my abode in that Country:
So far as that he made no difficulty to
put the worthieſt perſons of all his
Kingdom to Death, that he might have
his Pleaſure with their Wives and
Daughters. So looſe a Life occaſion'd
an Univerſal Diſorder: For as Kings are
look'd upon by their Subjects as the
Models by which they ought to ſquare
all their Actions; and that, indeed,
they ſeldom ſail to imitate their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and ſtill more their Vices: The
bad Example of this Prince paſs'd on
to the People, who would needs equal
him in Wickedneſs and Libertiniſm;
inſomuch that we need not wonder at
the puniſhment God inflicted upon them.</p>
               <p>

               <p>At that time was there in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi>

Sea-ſhore, with her Maids, and ſome
of her Fathers Servants, it ſeem'd to
her ſo Calm and Charming, that the
fancy took her to go on board a Ship,
ſo to divert herſelf upon the Water.
Her Attendants, without making over
much Reflection upon what they did,
did not divert her from the Deſign.
The Marriners made ready the Ship, all
her Company were eager to go with her
on board, and in the merry pin they all
were; they did not mind that they
diſtanc'd themſelves a little too far
from the Land, whither they did not
trouble their Heads about returning,
while it was in their Power. In the mean
while the Wind changing all on the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39314:25"/>
ſudden, the Storm became ſo great,
that being unable to put into any Port
of <hi>Africa;</hi> they were conſtrain'd to
abandon themſelves to the open Sea;
and were at length drove upon the
Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> in a place call'd<note n="*" place="margin">

Slaves by the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of that Place.
It was eaſie to ſee by their Cloaths and

               <p>He was well made and Gallant, the

that Love eaſily engag'd them,

The thing came at length ſo far, that

ſhe, without much trouble, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd

The Men and Women of her

one of the moſt beautiful Ladies of his
Court, call'd <hi>Florinda,</hi> Count <hi>Julian</hi>'s
Daughter; who was at that time in
his <hi>African</hi> Embaſſy. She had Wit
enough to perceive that the Kings
Courtſhip did not at all tend to her
own Honour, nor to that of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
ſince that it, doubtleſs, only
aim'd at Raviſhing her of it; and ſhe
had Virtue enough to receive his fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
with much indifference and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty;
but the more firmneſs ſhe exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:39314:27"/>
with the more obſtinacy did he
perſevere to overcome it.</p>
               <p>Now for the more eaſie effecting of
this his purpoſe, he made ſeveral new
Regulations in his Court: Among other
things, he order'd that when he ſhould
eat with his Queen, none but the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Palace ſhould ſerve at Table,
and requir'd them to be dreſs'd finer
than ordinary on ſuch days. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus eſtabliſh'd, one day after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
whereat <hi>Florinda</hi> had ſerv'd with
others, he ſo order'd matters, that he
caus'd her to enter a Room void of all
other Company, and following her
thither, whatever reſiſtance and ſcreams
ſhe was able to make, he gain'd of her,
at length, by force, what ſhe never
would have granted him.</p>
               <p>Being under the utmoſt Deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
at ſuch an Outrage, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how either to be Reveng'd or
Comforted, ſhe reſolv'd to make her
Caſe known to her Father. In ſhort,
after having contriv'd the moſt myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
terms ſhe could bethink her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of, that they might only be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood

of this Letter; which, Tranſlated out

                     <p>THe regret I have for the abſence
of a Father ſo dear to me as you
muſt needs be, makes me in Writing to
you, ſeek the Conſolation I cannot find, of
ſeeing you. Not that I mean to ſend you
all the News of the Palace<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Mabzan,</hi> Houſe.</note>, that ever

which, though it be already old in this Court,
will ever be new for ſuch a Maid as I;
and will ever appear in the Eyes of the

Prince as <hi>Rodrigo.</hi> You muſt know then,
my dear Father, that I had, heedleſly,
left upon a Table the Ring I ſend you in
this Letter; and was not ſo careful to
lock up cloſe this precious Jewel, which I
eſteem'd more than my Life, and which
you and my Mother had ſo earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to me: But the King having
a deſire to it, impetuouſly threw himſelf
to take it; and ſeeing I would not give
it him, he drew his Sword<note n="*" place="margin">

ſo many hacks, that whatever ſcreams and

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:39314:28"/>
as you ſee, cloven it in two, both the
Ring and Emerald enchas'd in it. So
vexatious and ſo unexpected an accident
plunges me into ſo much confuſion, that I
cannot explain it further; and makes me
conjure you to remedy it, if poſſible; for
to you only can I have recourſe in this
matter. My Mother is very ill, and I
ſtill worſe. I pray God to preſerve you.</p>

ſtaid in his Houſe only the time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to give his Wife order to feign
her being ſick of grief, for his and her
Daughter's abſence, and went directly
to Court; where he made no ſemblance

then was his Grief ſo much the more

that had done him ſo great an outrage,
was his Lord and King, from whom
he ſeem'd to be under an obligation of
enduring all, and that it was impoſſible
for him to wreak his Revenge.</p>
               <p>Wherefore not knowing what to do

himſelf to all that his Paſſion might

aſſembled his Relations and Friends,
who intereſting themſelves in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
<hi>Rodrigo</hi> had put upon the Count,
and animating one another to Revenge,
after having found that they were not
ſtrong enough to aſſert their Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
unleſs back'd by a foreign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
they unanimouſly reſolv'd that the
Count ſhould return into <hi>Africa</hi> to
treat with <hi>Muca;</hi> and that they on
their parts ſhould abide in their Houſes,
waiting the ſucceſs of his Voyage.
After having all embrac'd one another,
and engag'd to keep this Enterprize
very ſecret, the Count took Shipping,
with his Wife and Daughter, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

was very kindly receiv'd by the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,

was come to him, not on the behalf of

on his own account, to offer him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
up all that great Kingdom to the

               <p>This Propoſal was not diſpleaſing to

of the deſcent of the <hi>Moors</hi>
into <hi>Spain,</hi> with Captain <hi>Tariff,</hi> and
Count <hi>Julian</hi> his Enemy; and that,
after having over-run all <hi>Andalouſia,</hi>

which he ſaw himſelf threatned; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eaſie to judge that <hi>Tariff</hi> had
not made that tryal, to ſtop there.</p>
               <p>He knew Count <hi>Julian</hi> to be a Man
of Wit and Execution, of Courage, and
a through knowledge of War, a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> that knew the ſtate of his
Affairs, knew the Country, had there
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:39314:33"/>
many Adherents, nay, and Places,
wherein he could enter and go out as
often as he pleas'd. He eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
but too late, the fault he had
committed, in loſing, for a moments
Pleaſure, a man of ſuch importance,
and in giving him to his Enemies. He
made reflexion upon the bad poſture of
his Kingdom, ſince he had diſarm'd his
Subjects, and caus'd all the ſtrong
Places to be demoliſht. He conſidered
that the long Peace which <hi>Spain</hi> had
enjoy'd, was the occaſion that he had
no Diſciplin'd Troops, and that when
he had aſſembled an Army, they
would be only raw men: All this
plung'd him into ſurious Diſquiets.
He ask'd Counſel of all People, and
found none good. At length, having
conſulted and Arch-biſhop, a Relation
of his, call'd <hi>Torrife,</hi> and having told
him the little Money he had to raiſe
and keep forces on foot; this Arch-biſhop
perſuaded him to break open a
Place called the <hi>Enchanted Tower,</hi> where
there was ſaid to be a Treaſure. And
as this is a thing very extraordinary, I
am willing to inſert here at length
what the ſame <hi>Torrife</hi> told me; who
ſhortly after quitted that Kings Party,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:39314:34"/>
to come to Count <hi>Julian</hi> in our Camp;
and who could give the beſt account
of it, as having been preſent when
<hi>D. Rodrigo</hi> caus'd it to be open'd. Now
this is what he then told me.</p>
               <p>About a mile from <hi>Toledo,</hi> between
ſteep Rocks that lye Eaſt of that great
City, there was formerly a Tower, of
a very ancient and very magnificent
ſtructure, tho a little endamag'd by
Time, that conſumes all: Under whoſe
foundation was a very deep Cave, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
into four different Vaults,
acroſs a very narrow Entrance cut in
the Rock, where a great Iron Door had
been made up, with a thouſand Locks,
and as many Bolts: Upon this Door
there was <hi>Greek</hi> Characters, that ſeem'd
rather Cyphers than Letters, and might
be diverſely interpreted; but whoſe
meaning were, (as thoſe pretended,
who thought they knew them beſt)
that the King that ſhould open this
Cave, and diſcover all the Wonders
that were therein, would certainly find
a great deal of Good and Evil.</p>
               <p>Several Kings before this, had had a
deſire to ſhrift into the truth of this
myſtery, but whatever Orders they
had given for that purpoſe, they had
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:39314:34"/>
never been able to cauſe them to be
executed. Upon the opening this
Door, ſo great a Noiſe was heard, that
the Earth ſeem'd to open at the ſame
time under the feet of thoſe that meant
to enter therein:<note place="margin">Hauf.</note> They were ſeiz'd with
ſuch a dread, that moſt of 'em fell ſick
upon't, ſome dy'd, and no body had
the Courage to enter further. The
Door had ſtill been ſhut up more
ſtrongly than before, and People ſtill
believ'd that the time appointed for
the breaking ſo great an Enchantment
was not yet come; but <hi>Rodrigo</hi>'s ill
fate would have it that this fatal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
was reſerved for him. He had
choſen very reſolute men to enter with
him into that Cave; but they had not
gone very far, when the Torches they
had being extinguiſh'd, the greater part
fled away, out of a pannick fear which
ſeiz'd them, of a terrible Hobgoblin
they ſaid they ſaw. The King in great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
caus'd other Flambeaux to be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
which he had caus'd to be made on
purpoſe, after a particular manner, that
ſo the air of the Cave might not put
them out: With this light he entred
the firſt of all, and without ſhewing
any fear, tho perhaps he was not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:39314:35"/>
exempt from a little; hardly had he
gone ſome ſteps, but that he found
himſelf in a beautiful Room, enrich'd
with as delicate Sculptures as thoſe we ſee
in the greateſt Palaces: In the midſt of
this great Room was a Brazen Statue,
with a fierce poſture, plac'd upon a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
three Cubits high, holding in its
hand a<note n="*" place="margin">Macmah.</note> Battel-Axe, with which it
ſtruck the Earth from time to time,
and ſo ſtrongly, that there was reaſon
to believe it to be partly the violent
agitation it occaſioned in the air, by
the blows it gave, that made the great
noiſe that was heard at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rodrigo,</hi> tho a little ſtartled, did not
however loſe Courage; and began to
conjure this Phantome; telling him,
That he did not pretend to commit any
Diſorder in the place of his abode, and
that he would go his ways as ſoon as
he had ſeen all its Wonders.</p>
               <p>He had no ſooner uttered theſe words,
but the Statue left off beating the Earth.
The King and his Attendants being a
little encourag'd, moſt carefully viſited
all the corners of that great Room.
On the Left hand of the Statue they
ſaw theſe words written on the Wall,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:39314:35"/>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy Prince, thy ill Deſtiny hath
brought thee hither.</hi> Turning to the
Right, he found nothing better, for
there was written, <hi>Thou ſhalt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt
by foreign Nations, and thy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſhall be puniſht as well as thee, for
all their Crimes.</hi> Upon the back of
the Statue was written theſe words in
<hi>Arabick, To my Succours:</hi> and upon its
Breaſt theſe, <hi>I do my Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I forgot to ſay that at the entrance of
this Room there was a kind of round
Fat, like a Bowl; from whence there
iſſued a kind of ſpout, whoſe ſurging
made a hideous murmur.</p>
               <p>After having well conſidered all
theſe things, and caus'd the Inſcriptions
of them to be taken in a Table-book;
the King went away very much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd,
and very peeviſh; and had no
ſooner turn'd his back, but that the
Statue fell again to ſtriking the ground,
after its uſual manner. The King caus'd
this Cave to be ſhut up again more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
than before, and had its entrance
ſtopp'd with Earth, that ſo none thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
might enter therein, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all his Attendants to make the
leaſt mention of this Adventure, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the terrour that ſo ill a preſage
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:39314:36"/>
might put into all Peoples minds: But
nevertheleſs is was immediately buzz'd
about all the Court.</p>
               <p>The Night following Crys were
heard, that waywards, like to thoſe
that People make when they are fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and after a Clap, that made a
mighty hurly burly, this old Tower
ſunk; and all people were amazed
the next day to find no more footſteps
of it, than if all they had ſeen before
had been only a Dream.</p>
               <p>The King having aſſembled the Wiſe
men of his Kingdom, to demand of
them the Explication of all he had ſeen:
They found that the Brazen Statue,
with its perpetual motion, ſignifyed
Time, that was oblig'd never to ſtop,
as was noted by the Inſcription it had
upon its Breaſt. That that which was
on the Back ſignifyed, that in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of time, Spain <hi>ſhould be conquered
by the</hi> Arabians: That of the Walls
preſaged, <hi>The loſs of his Kingdom, and
a great Calamity of all his People:</hi> And
that above the Door, <hi>The great Evils
the Conquered would ſuffer, and the
great benefits the Victors would thence
derive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:39314:36"/>
Such an Explication gave no little
anxiety to <hi>Rodrigo,</hi> and to ſuch of his
People as heard it. They all lift up
their Eyes to Heaven, well ſeeing that
it was from God alone that they could
hope for any ſuccours. For tho they
had news that <hi>Tariff</hi> and Count <hi>Julian</hi>
were returned into <hi>Africa,</hi> this was not
capable of re-aſſuring the King againſt
ſo many intimations of the anger of
Heaven. Whereupon he began to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the re-erecting all the Fortifications
he had caus'd to be demoliſh'd; and
had Proclamation made throughout
his Kingdom, that the People ſhould
take up again the Arms he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
and exercize themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as before. He reſolv'd alſo to quit
<hi>Toledo,</hi> and go make his reſidence at
<hi>Cordoua;</hi> that ſo he might be nearer
the place, from whence apparently all
the miſchief was to come, and thereto
apply Remedies the more eaſily.</p>

made a Body of thirty thouſand good

Ships, wherein he put not only all ſorts
of Ammunition, but a great abundance
of Arms, Tools and Inſtruments of
War. And as ſoon as this Fleet was

               <p>This Prince, not content with theſe
great preparations, imagin'd that as it
was a War of Religion he was going
to undertake, it was convenient to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
all the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Forces. For
which reaſon he diſpatch'd a Man away

with what Foot and Horſe he could

who expreſs'd much Joy to ſee, by

Foot, and three thouſand Horſe;
the Command of which he would needs
give to Prince <hi>Mahomet-Gilhair,</hi> his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

was the few Ships he had in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to put to Sea, as not being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for ſo great an Embarkment.
For which reaſon he was oblig'd to

               <p>Theſe two great Armies being arriv'd
on the Coaſt of <hi>Africa, Muca,</hi> who
waited for them there, after having
held a Council of War with all the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Officers, found they needed ſome

days refreſhment after the fatigue of
the Sea. For which reaſon all the Troops
were brought on ſhoar; and that the
time they might ſpend in refreſhing

Count <hi>Julian</hi> were ſent before, with a

choſe for this Expedition were to the

<hi>Moors</hi> as <hi>Julianiſt Chriſtians;</hi> and about
three hundred Horſe: With theſe they
croſs'd the Streight of <hi>Gilbralter,</hi> and

he ſent his General <hi>Aſtolpho,</hi> with an

in the Corner of his Chimney, a Prophecy,
importing that the people of our Religion
ſhould loſe the Government of our Country,
which was to be conquer'd by the <hi>Moors:</hi>
And among other things, it was preciſely
mention'd, that the Captain who was to
make this Conqueſt, ſhould be very brave,
and have on his Right Shoulder a Mole
very hairy, of the bigneſs of a Pea, nay,
and that his Right Hand ſhould be much
longer than his other; inſomuch, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
stooping, he might cover all his knee
with that hand. He who made this
Prediction is an honeſt Religious, for whom
we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have a ſingular veneration.

               <p>
                  <hi>Tariff</hi> having caus'd what this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
had newly ſaid, to be explain'd by
a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Interpreter he had with him,
was overjoy'd to hear theſe things. He
ſtrips himſelf immediately, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Count <hi>Julian,</hi> and of all his
People, and having caus'd the place the
Woman inſtanc'd to be view'd, they
found there the Mole ſhe had menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
and the Right Hand longer than
the Left, tho not quite ſo long as ſhe
had ſaid.</p>
               <p>This News being ſpread about the
Army, occaſion'd an univerſal joy, and
all the Officers would needs ſhare in
that their General had, to hear, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
proofs, that he it was that was
to have the Honour of ſo noble a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.
And indeed he was reſolv'd to
give Battel, and therein to vanquiſh or
dye. And that all the Souldiers might
have the ſame Reſolution, he would
needs deprive 'em of all hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:39314:42"/>
For that purpoſe, as he wanted no
induſtry, he ſecretly caus'd Fire to be
ſet to all the Ships that had brought
his Troops, and reſerv'd nothing but a
ſmall Veſſel, nay, and would needs
have that too put out to Sea, for the
ſending by it to <hi>Muca,</hi> the good or ill
News of the Battel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tariff</hi> having given this Order, and
by a Speech, ſhort indeed, but pithy,
animated his Souldiers to the Conflict:
It was very bloody and obſtinate on
both ſides, but at length the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
were put to flight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſtolpho,</hi> wanting neither Heart nor
Conduct, perform'd in this occaſion,
not only the Duty of a General, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that of a Souldier; he Rally'd the
Runaways the beſt he could, return'd
ſeveral times to the Charge, and would
never yield himſelf up, whatever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
he had made him, chuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to dye with his Sword in Hand,
as all thoſe are wont to do that are jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

to leave no room ever to be<note n="*" place="margin">

In this action Count <hi>Julian</hi> was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly

                  <hi>ROdrigo</hi> being dejected, as I have

not what courſe to take to hinder the
progreſs of the Enemies, and with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hopes thoſe of his Council and
Court would needs flatter him, he was
not capable of receiving any Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſo full had his Heart been of anxiety
for ſome time, and pre-poſſeſs'd with
the ill Opinion he had of the ſucceſs of
this War. He was not wanting how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to uſe all poſſible Diligence, and
omitted nothing of what he thought
could help to free him out of ſo great a
danger, for he was but too ſenſible,
that he it was, particularly, that ſo
horrible a Tempeſt threatned.</p>
               <p>Wherefore he caus'd the Troops he
had levy'd in all the Provinces of his
Kingdom to advance from all parts,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:39314:44"/>
and gave them a general Rendezvouze
at <hi>Cordona,</hi> where of late he kept his
Court; that ſo he might ſend them
from thence to ſuch places as ſhould
need them, and be the readier to take
ſuch courſes as his occaſions ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p>His Orders were ſo well Executed,
that in a little time his Army was found
to be fourſcore thouſand Foot, and
twenty thouſand Horſe; all of 'em
People huddled indeed together, and
moſt of 'em without Arms and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
He gave them for their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
the Arch-biſhop <hi>D. Oppas,</hi> his very
near Relation; whom he ſent before
with thirty thouſand Foot, and ſix
thouſand Horſe, to try Fortune once
again againſt <hi>Tariff,</hi> and endeavour to
take the Count <hi>D. Julian,</hi> imagining,
that as he had the Secret and Conduct
of this Enterprize, it was, doubtleſs,
the moſt compendious way to put an
end to the War.</p>
               <p>In the mean while freſh reinſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
came every minute to <hi>Tariff,
Muca</hi> caus'd the two Armies that were
left behind in <hi>Africa,</hi> to file daily into
<hi>Spain,</hi> as well that which <hi>Hiza</hi> had
brought from <hi>Arabia,</hi> as that which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:39314:44"/>
Prince <hi>Mahomet Gilhair</hi> had brought
from <hi>Tunis:</hi> But as they came by little
and little, and ſeparately, it could not
otherwiſe be but that there muſt be
ſome Diſorder. <hi>Tariff,</hi> to prevent the
being ſurpriz'd in the hurry of Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to draw his Troops up in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
array, accordingly as they deſcended
from their Ships, reſolv'd to take more
ground, and a little farther in the
Country to chooſe a place ſufficiently
ſpacious for the Encampment of his
whole Army, and in ſecurity wait the
coming of <hi>D. Rodrigo:</hi> Wherefore he
advanc'd as far as the River which the
<hi>Arabs</hi> call<note n="*" place="margin">'Tis the River cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Guida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Guidalete,</hi> at the ſame
time that the Archbiſhop <hi>D. Oppas</hi> came
thither, and ſent to propoſe to him a
Truce for eight days, to give the two
Armies time to recover themſelves after
the fatigues of the March. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop,
who doubtleſs was not inform'd
of the ſtate of the Enemies Army, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
this Truce would turn to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
by giving his own time to
encreaſe. But in the mean while, all
thoſe Troops that <hi>Tariff</hi> had caus'd to
file off, according as they landed, being
come, they made up Sixty Thouſand
Foot, and Ten Thouſand Horſe, at the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:39314:45"/>
review he made of them after the Truce
was expir'd. <hi>Oppas</hi> perceiving the fault
he had committed, and fearing that
the King would reproach him with
having given the Enemies time to join
all their Forces, and fortify their Camp,
he reſolv'd to give them Battel without
any farther delay. The reinforcement
he had receiv'd, join'd with what he had
before, made not up above Forty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men: Yet was he not wanting
with theſe to puſh the Moors ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
that <hi>Tariff</hi> was conſtrain'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
after having loſt Three Thouſand
Foot, and about Five Hundred Horſe:
Whereas the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> loſt no more in
this action, than Two Thouſand Foot,
and Two Hundred Horſe. The Night
having parted them, <hi>Oppas</hi> alſo retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into his own Camp, to let his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
take Breath, before he renew'd
the Conflict. The number of the
Wounded being very great on both
ſides, <hi>Oppas</hi> ſent to propoſe a Truce to
<hi>Tariff,</hi> for three days, which was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
concluded on between the two
Generals. Things being in this eſtate,
the following Night, a Traytor (for ſo
he may well be call'd, ſince he ſold his
own Countrey) ſtole out of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:39314:45"/>
Camp, into that of the <hi>Arabs.</hi>
This Man being the Companion of
<hi>Oppas,</hi> and call'd <hi>Siſebert,</hi> went to tell
<hi>Tariff,</hi> that the King <hi>D. Rodrigo</hi>'s Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
had only demanded this Truce,
that he might ſurprize him that Night,
and put him by that means the more
eaſily to rout. <hi>Tariff</hi> affording Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to this notice, upon the account
of the eminent Quality of the perſon
that brought it, (tho it was an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
as was afterwards verify'd)
thought it became him to prevent his
Enemy, and without waiting till he had
put himſelf in a poſture to execute his
evil intentions, he made his Souldiers
ſtand immediately to their Arms, and
caus'd them to march directly to the
<hi>Christians</hi> Camp, where they fell on
with ſo much impetuoſity, that they
forc'd it, put the whole Army to rout,
took General <hi>Oppas,</hi> with the Principal
Officers, Priſoners, and got an ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
Booty, and an infinity of Slaves.</p>
               <p>After this Victory, <hi>Tariff</hi> made
great preſents to <hi>Siſebert,</hi> and retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

found twenty three thouſand Horſe,

them to underſtand the danger their

Liberty depended on the good or ill
ſucceſs of the Battel he was going to

no more ſuccours to be expected from

               <p>The Souldiers being encourag'd by

there happen'd a remarkable thing, and
and of an ill augure, which was that
<hi>D. Ramiro, Alfier Major</hi> of King <hi>Rod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigo;</hi>

his Horſe gave him ſo terrible a fall,

               <p>And indeed, <hi>Rodrigo</hi> found it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to go and encamp ſix Leagues

either parties having the occaſion to
boaſt of the advantage. What moſt
afflicted General <hi>Tariff,</hi> was, that
Prince <hi>Mahomet Gilhair,</hi> the King of
<hi>Thunis</hi> Son, and Count <hi>Julian,</hi> were
both dangerouſly wounded in this
action, and the later particularly of
three great wounds. On the other
ſide, <hi>Rodrigo</hi> being paul'd by the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the Enemies, found that all he
had been thitherto able to do, was but
a ſmall matter, and deſponding of his
being capable of doing any thing more
hereafter, he knew not what to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
upon; and all the courſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd

bad and dangerous, he choſe rather to
leave the Deciſion of Fortune to the

having taken a ſtedfaſt reſolution
to Conquer then or Dye.</p>
               <p>Whereupon having marſhall'd all his

them to the Enemies with great vigour,
and was by them receiv'd with ſo much
bravery and firmneſs, that there dy'd
that day fifteen hundred Foot, and
two hundred and fifty Horſe, of the
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and fifteen hundred <hi>Moors,</hi>
in all, as well Horſe as Foot. As for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:39314:49"/>
the wounded, on both ſides, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

again at break of day, but not with

ſeeing his Men ſtagger, threw

caus'd Count <hi>Julian</hi> to come to view
him, he was found to be a very ſimple
and ignorant Swain, from whom they
could hardly get a word, and much

as he was keeping his flock upon the

he had ſeen coming towards him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

a furious voice, and frightful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
had bid him pull off forthwith
a Coat lin'd with Sheep-skin he had
then on; that accordingly having ſtript
himſelf immediately, he had caus'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:39314:51"/>
him to take thoſe fine Cloaths in lieu
of his own; and that having afterwards
ask'd him if he had any thing to eat in
his Scrip, he had given him a little
Bread he had left. After which, the
Unknown having taken his Crook,
commanded him to come ſhew him
the way; which he did, putting him
in a little path that went upwards,
which he ſaw him mount, till he loſt
ſight of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tariff</hi> was not ſatisfy'd with this
News, for after having diſcours'd the
People of the Country of the place
where the Shepherd had ſeen <hi>Rodrigo,</hi>
he underſtood he was gone towards
<hi>Caſtile;</hi> inſomuch that he loſt hopes
of finding him, and bent his thoughts
wholly upon taking all the advantages
he might derive from his Victory.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Zahra Beneliaza</hi> was at <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doua,</hi>
at the taking of that Town; and
tho ſhe had time enough, before the
Defeat of her Husband, to make her
eſcape into <hi>Caſtile,</hi> ſhe had not done ſo,
either that ſhe had been ſurpriz'd by
<hi>Tariff</hi>'s Diligence, or for want of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
and improving her time; or
rather, in ſhort, through the ill luck
thoſe labour under, whom Fortune

               <p>
                  <hi>Tariff</hi> left her in her Palace, without
ſuffering any one to enter therein, to
commit the leaſt Diſorder; he only
made ſure of her Perſon as well as the
Palace: And as this great City could
not be kept without a great number of
Troops, he thought fitting to leave
there Prince <hi>Mahomet Gilhair,</hi> as well
for the containing 'em in their Duty,
as for the recovering his perfect health,
for he was not yet well cur'd of his

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:39314:52"/>
he particularly encharg'd Prince <hi>Gilhair</hi>
to have great reſpect for Queen <hi>Zahra

that ſhe might be as little as poſſible

Feaſts and Merriments at <hi>Cordoua,</hi> he
daily invented ſomething new to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert

were wholly taken up in making her a

As he had all the conveniency of ſeeing
her he could deſire, the reſpect he bare
her, had long hinder'd him from decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his paſſion to her. But this at
length being become the ſtrongeſt, he
could not forbear giving her to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
in a thouſand converſations he
had with her, that if ſhe would again
eſpouſe the Religion in which ſhe had
been brought up, he would bring her
back into her own Countrey, with the
Crown of <hi>Thunis,</hi> which he would put
upon her Head, inſtead of that of <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
which ſhe had loſt. Every time he
diſcours'd her upon this point, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
ſhe did not underſtand him;
but he imagin'd it to be an uneaſineſs
of hers, in ſuffering a Declaration of
Love, that hinder'd her from anſwering;
and that he had to vanquiſh rather her
modeſty than her averſion. At length,
they two only being together one day,
and he thinking her diſpos'd to be more

thoſe that had been thrown upon the

who with her were converted. This

inſomuch, that having ſeen
<hi>Mahomet</hi> make profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

ſhe reſolv'd, tho with trouble, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<hi>Abulcacim Adilbard</hi> how matters
went, whom <hi>Tariff</hi> had left with that
Prince, in all things to aſſiſt him, with
his Council. <hi>Aldilbar</hi> was extreamly
afflicted at the tydings, and would by
no means believe the leaſt on't for a
long time; imagining this Woman
might perchance, have a grudge to the
Prince, for ſome particular reaſon<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Varia,</hi> falſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note>. But
making reflexion upon the greatneſs
of the paſſion he had long obſerv'd
this Prince have for the Queen,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:39314:55"/>
he began to believe him capable of
all.</p>
               <p>He had then the curioſity, to fathom
the thing, without making ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance

ſo well to obſerve his actions, that

diſcover'd all that had paſs'd between

               <p>
                  <hi>Tariff</hi> was ſurpriz'd and perplex'd at

attributed to ſome jealouſie, or to ſome
particular ill will, which might make

Wherefore he contented himſelf with

he had diſcover'd to <hi>Tariff,</hi> who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
gave notice of it to the King of

him the Proceſs that <hi>Adilbar</hi> had caus'd

               <p>The Proceedings of this General,

Encamp'd in the midſt of that Plain,

five and twenty on their ſide.</p>
               <p>This ſucceſs having puft up their
Hearts, they would needs ſee the day
following, if Fortune<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ychadad Zogle,</hi> Good Fortune try'd.</note> would be as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to them. But having found
the <hi>Moors</hi> upon their Guard, they were
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:39314:61"/>
received a little more ſmartly than the
day before, and conſtrained to return
into the Town faſter than they came
thence. The <hi>Moors</hi> purſu'd them ſo
cloſely, that the Governour of <hi>Carmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
fearing that by opening the Gates
to receive them, the Enemies would
enter pell-mell with them, and ſo make
themſelves maſters of the Place; he
found it more expedient to let the few
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> that were without to be loſt,
than to loſe the Town in endeavouring
to ſave them; and forbid the opening
to them the Gate, he fear'd it would
be no longer in his power to ſhut.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſeeing the Reſolution
their Governour had taken, all on
the ſudden took a very generous one;
for having all engag'd rather to dye
like Men of Courage, than be made
ſlaves, they fac'd about upon thoſe that
purſued them, and fighting like Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
People, kill'd eight hundred of
them, and puſh'd on into the midſt of
<hi>Muca</hi>'s Camp, where they were all
kill'd upon the ſpot, or taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
without ſo much as one of them
eſcaping. <hi>Muca</hi> being very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
at theſe two bad ſucceſſes, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the Principal Officers to hold a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:39314:62"/>
Council of War, wherein it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
on the morrow morning to
make a General attacque. The Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were ſet up againſt the Walls, and
the <hi>Moors</hi> mounted them with great
Reſolution: On the other ſide, the
Beleaguer'd defended themſelves with
great firmneſs, Killing and Topſy-tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
thoſe that mounted. Among
others, the Governour of the Place,
call'd <hi>Galo,</hi> did then perform Heroick
Actions; for he alone, with two men
he had with him, defended a whole
Courtine, from one Tower to another,
which he had undertaken to maintain;
and with a Croſs-bow, kill'd or
wounded for his own part that day
himſelf alone fourſcore <hi>Moors.</hi> This
Conflict laſted from Noon till Night,
and in it the Vice-roy loſt fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men; whereas the Beſieged, as
we were afterwards inform'd, loſt but
three hundred.</p>
               <p>The time and men <hi>Muca</hi> loſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Place, made him reſolve, for
the rendring himſelf maſter of it, to
try another way than that of force,
which he had ſped ſo ill in thitherto.
Whereupon he ſent to ſummons the
Beſieged to ſurrender, offering not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:39314:62"/>
to ſpare their Lives, but to grant
them great Priviledges, if they made
their Compoſition ſooner than later.
This Propoſal caus'd the Beſieged to
open their Eyes, and the Principal of
them aſſembling to confer with their
Governour; they concluded, that tho
they ſhould ſtill hold out for a while,
their<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Zid,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Proviſions would at length fail
them, and their Souldiers would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh;
that all that Province was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſubdu'd, that they could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſuccours from any body, that
thus ſooner or later they would be a
Prey to the Victorious: For which
reaſon, they made anſwer, That they
were content to open him the Gates of
their City, provided he would ſuffer them
to depart thence with their Wives and
Children, and all they had of Money,
Arms and Baggage, and generally all
things whatever that they could carry
along with them, whither they pleas'd,
with full freedom.</p>
               <p>All that they required was granted
them, bating the Baggage; upon which
they were told, That they might only
carry away with them, what they
could load upon a hundred Waggons,
with which they were contented.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:39314:63"/>
Thus all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> departed, and
went to another City near the Sea, call'd
<hi>His pala</hi> in their Tongue, while that
<hi>Muca,</hi> after having plac'd a Governour
there, with ſome Souldiers, for its
Guard, decamp'd forthwith to march
towards a very great and populous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their Tongue
call <hi>Merida.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Town there was a very brave
<hi>Christian</hi> Governour, and as he Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd
himſelf in this Siege, and therein
perform'd Actions worthy of Praiſe,
he well deſerves that I ſhould dwell a
little longer upon the Relation of his
Performances.</p>
               <p>This Governour, call'd <hi>Salara,</hi> ſeeing
the havock made by the <hi>Moors</hi> Army
in the Countries where it paſs'd, caus'd
all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Neighbourhood
of <hi>Merida</hi> to retire into that Town,
with their Wives and Children, and
caus'd them to bring along with them,
all the Victuals there was in the
Country; where having left only what
could not be remov'd, he himſelf ſent
ſome to burn all the Villages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
and to make a havock through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the Country, that ſo when the
<hi>Moors</hi> ſhould come thither, they might
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:39314:63"/>
find nothing left. He did not content
himſelf with this, he caus'd all the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be poyſon'd, and having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
all the Peaſants, he caus'd 'em to
work upon the Fortifications of the
Town: He repair'd its Walls, its Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements
and Parapets: And having
caus'd a Review to be made of what
men he had in a condition to fight, he
found 'em five thouſand ſtrong, whom
he diſtributed into the Towers, and
other Places he judg'd convenient.
Things were in this poſture when the
Vice-roy drew near the Place, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
block'd it up on all ſides, began
by ſending to Summons <hi>Salaru</hi> to Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render,
otherwiſe that he would put
all that were in it to the Sword.</p>
               <p>But the Governour having made
him Anſwer, That he might do as he
pleas'd; That the Mercy of God was
greater than his Forces, and that it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
him more Confidence than all
his Threatnings gave him Fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muca</hi> being provok'd at this Refuſal,
caus'd all things to be prepar'd for the
making the Aſſault. The next day
the <hi>Moors</hi> being mounted to the Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade,
were there receiv'd, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
repuls'd by the Beleaguer'd, by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:39314:64"/>
means of the great order, with which
they ran to the<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ygata,</hi> help in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</note> relief of one another
upon occaſion. The Attack laſted the
whole day, wherein the Beſiegers loſt
ſix hundred Men, and the Beſieged on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fifty ſeven. But the <hi>Moors</hi> having
renew'd the fight the next morning at
break of day, that they might afford
the Beſieged no reſpite it was ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
and furious, that the Town
had like to have been taken at unawares.
The <hi>Moors</hi> having already got to the
top of the Wall, and being ready to
leap into the Town, when that <hi>Salara,</hi>
who went to all the places that had
need of his Succours, running thither
juſt in the nick, tumbled them down
from the top of the Walls, and by this
means deliver'd <hi>Merida,</hi> that but for
him had been now taken; obliging
the Beſiegers to retire with the loſs of
eight hundred men, whereas he had
loſt but about three hundred.</p>
               <p>The Vigour the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in theſe two Conflicts, did a little
cool that of the Vice-roy, who reſolv'd
to quarter all his Army round the
place, and ſee if he could not take it by
Famine. <hi>Salaru</hi> having perceiv'd his
Deſign, made a very exact review of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:39314:64"/>
all that was in the Town, that he might
more duly ſee how long his Victuals
could laſt. He found there to be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
uſeleſs Mouths, in Women, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and Old Men, that were paſt
bearing of Arms, and yet conſum'd the
Proviſions, that began already to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh,
tho there had been as yet but
thirty days Siege, and that they had
laid up great ſtores before-hand. He
alſo ſaw it to be impoſſible for him to
hold out much longer, and not being
ſtrong enough to ſtir out of the enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Town to fight the Enemies,
he bethought himſelf of employing
Stratagem, to endeavour to make them
raiſe the Siege. Wherefore he ſent
to <hi>Muca,</hi> That he was miſtaken, if he
thought, by Famine, to force him to
Surrender: that he had ſtill Bread
enough for above ten years; and to
make good his words, he caus'd a world
of Baskets full of Loaves, to be thrown
from off the Walls.</p>
               <p>This Complement had like to have
made <hi>Muca</hi> run mad, and he made no
anſwer to it but by a General Aſſault,
which laſted a whole day, with great
vigour on both ſides: for there fell
above five hundred <hi>Moors,</hi> without
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:39314:65"/>
reckoning Captain <hi>Aliculeyman,</hi> who
was very much wounded, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
afflicted <hi>Muca.</hi> It coſt the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
little leſs, who alſo loſt in this
occaſion four hundred men. But <hi>Muca</hi>
having been oblig'd to cauſe the Retreat
to be ſounded, by reaſon of the night,
the next morning he ſent a Trumpeter
to the Governour, to ſignifie to him,
That he had made an Oath, and ſworn
by the moſt high God, that if the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguer'd
delay'd Surrendring any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
they ſhould after this, all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
implore his Mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salaru</hi> having ſtraitways aſſembled
the principal men of the Town, gave
them in a little time a very exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the ſtate of the place; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having made them apprehend the
neceſſity they were in of all things, and
the little likelihood he ſaw of being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
they all agreed to Surrender,
but upon the moſt advantageous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
they could get: Inſomuch that
they made him anſwer; That they
would willingly put the Place into his
hands, provided he would ſuffer them,
they, their Wives and Children, with
their Arms and Baggage, to go to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
City of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> they ſhould
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:39314:65"/>
pleaſe; that all thoſe that were minded to
ſtay, ſhould not receive any ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor be conſtrain'd to quit their
Religion. <hi>Muca</hi> agreeing to all theſe
Articles, and having been induc'd to
Sign 'em, and ſwear in the Name of
the Caliph his Maſter, never to act
to the contrary, conceiv'd ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
of the Bravery and Fidelity of
this Governour, and of his ability to
take his Precautions, that he took a
Scimitar of great value he had at his
Girdle, and himſelf put it on his ſide,
ſaying, That the Valour with which he
had ſav'd his People from ſo great a
Danger, merited a thouſand times more
Honour than he did him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salaru</hi> having given him the Keys of
the Town, where the Riff-raff only
ſtaid, he took all thoſe along with him
that were minded to follow him, with
whom he went on Shipboard, to waft
o're to the neareſt Iſlands of that Coaſt,
that he might not ſee the Ruine of his
Country, and ſo ſhelter himſelf from the

               <p>The Vice-roy of <hi>Africa</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
at the taking of this great City,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:39314:66"/>
but could not ſtay there long, for
that there was no ſubſiſtance to be got
out of the Country, that had been
forſaken by the People, who had all
taken refuge in the Province, call'd in
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and had left
this Country deſert. For which reaſon,
after having put a Garriſon into the
Place, he caus'd all his Troops to
march towards <hi>Hiſpalis.</hi> They were
not gone far, when that his Scouts
came to give him notice, that the
world of People that had taken refuge
there, had occaſion'd ſuch a Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the mortality was general.
This News put a full ſtop to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer
that way; and the fear he was in
of cauſing his Army to periſh, made
him return to <hi>Cordoua,</hi> to rejoin <hi>Tariff,</hi>

This General having expected to
have met with ſome oppoſition in this
Place, was overjoy'd it did not oblige

in the Name of the <hi>Caliph Almanzor,</hi>
his Maſter, for ever to obſerve the
Conditions, on which they would put
the Keys of ſo great a Town into his
hands. He would needs alſo, for the
maintaining it in the ancient Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
it had, of being the Capital City

Governour, one of his principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,

               <p>It is a thing ſomewhat aſtoniſhing to

they found not one living Soul<note n="*" place="margin">

in the midſt of which there is a City

               </p>
               <p>This City would needs ſtand out an
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:39314:69"/>
Aſſault, that was bloody; after which
it Surrendred upon very advantageous
terms. Thus they ſtaid there only the
time requiſite for the ſettling, as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of all that Province, a Captain
of great Reputation, born in <hi>Arabia,</hi>
call'd <hi>Iſmael Abenhut;</hi> and reſolved to

               </p>
               <p>They are very rugged and high;

they advanced there about twenty

inſomuch that the Generals
having made reflexion that their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
having only given them order to
Conquer <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> being a great

               <p>THE two Generals taking the

upon their departure from <hi>Arragon,</hi>
bent their march towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi>
and continued it without any ſtay, to
a great Plain, in the midſt of which
is a great City, enclos'd with good
Walls; whence you have a Proſpect
of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, that is but
but four ſmall Leagues diſtant: All the

Siege, thought fitting to ſend to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
the Inhabitants to Surrender, as
all the other Cities of <hi>Spain</hi> had done;
in conſideration of which, he promis'd
to ſuffer 'em to live in Peace, according
to their Law, and to hinder any injury
from benig done them. But the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter
coming near the City-gate, the
Centinel that was upon the Wall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hearkning to what he ſaid aloud, or
imparting it to the Governour, let fly a
Bullet from a Stone-Bow at him, by
which the Trumpeter perceiving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
wounded, without ſtaying any
longer, came flying to the Camp. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff</hi>
being provok'd at the little regard
they had for a man that came from him,
took this affair, not only for a want of

of all the Laws of War, and the Right
of Nations, and gave order for the
Attacking the Town on all ſides.</p>
               <p>The next day the Governour, call'd
<hi>Agros,</hi> having been inform'd of what
the Centinel had done, was very much
ſurpriz'd at this miſunderſtanding, and
thought convenient to ſend to make
his excuſe to <hi>Tariff,</hi> and propoſe to him
at the ſame time a Truce for three
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:39314:70"/>
days; during which, they wou'd ſee
to contrive the means of making their
Capitulation.</p>
               <p>The Envoy of <hi>Valence</hi> was kindly
receiv'd by the General. The Truce
was granted, and the Hoſtages having
been agreed on, he went out of the
Town with full power to treat on
the behalf of the Beſieged, and came
to <hi>Tariff</hi>'s Camp, with whom he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to deliver him the Town, on
Condition, that all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that
were minded to go thence, might have
the freedom ſo to do, with their
Wives and Children, and all their
Goods, to whatever place they ſhould
pleaſe to chooſe. As alſo that all
thoſe that would ſtay there, might do
it without being injur'd in the leaſt.
<hi>Tariff</hi> made no difficulty of granting
them all they demanded, and of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
to obſerve what he granted in
the name of <hi>Almanzor</hi> his Maſter. In
conſideration of which, he made his
entrance into that Town, and there
left as Governour one of his Captains,
a Native of <hi>Arabia Foelix,</hi> nam'd
<hi>Abubaxar Xandalg,</hi> whom he plac'd
there with a numerous Garriſon, to
curb not only that Town, but the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:39314:71"/>
whole Province depending on it.</p>
               <p>After having thus ſettled matters
at <hi>Valence, Tariff</hi> and <hi>Muca,</hi> having bent
their march a little more towards the
<hi>South,</hi> entred the Province, by the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> call'd <hi>Murtia;</hi> where having
met with no reſiſtance, they render'd
themſelves Maſters of the Capital City,
that goes by the ſame name. Finding
it forſaken by the Inhabitants, and the
Country very good, they reſolv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſettling there a part of the Souldiers
of their Army, for the re-peopling it,
and therein to put as Governour,
<hi>Abraham Alexandri,</hi> by Nation an <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi>
Theſe two Armies being by theſe
means reduc'd to a very ſcanty num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and by leaving ſo many upon
the way, both for Guarding and Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
all the Towns where they had

thence.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Governour of <hi>Cordoua,
Abulxacim</hi> by name, knowing
the coming of the two Generals, went
out to meet them four Leagues from
that Town, with all the Foot and Horſe
in Arms he had, and accompany'd
them in the Triumphant Entrance they
made into that Place. During the
abode they had occaſion to make
there, to recover themſelves after the
Hardſhips of ſo long and painful a
War, they apply'd themſelves carefully
to regulate the form of Government
of the Countries they had Conquer'd.
But above all things, they judg'd it in
no wiſe ſafe for them, to ſuffer the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> to remain Maſters of ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
a Town as <hi>Hiſpalis.</hi> I have
noted in the beginning of this Hiſtory,
that the Siege of this Town had not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:39314:72"/>
been undertaken, for fear of bringing
the Peſtilence into the Army: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a truſty man was ſent on purpoſe
into thoſe parts, to ſee how matters
ſtood; who having brought word back,
That the Contagion was there more
rife than ever, and that an infinite
number of Perſons dy'd of it, it was
judg'd requiſite to leave it ſtill alone,
and that it would be ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
by this Scourge of Heaven,
without there being any need to infect
it likewiſe with that of War.</p>
               <p>One thing on which they found
themſelves oblig'd to think preferable
to all others, was to recompence Count
<hi>Julian,</hi> for the great Services he had
done to <hi>Valid.</hi> They had promis'd
him to cauſe his Caſtle of <hi>Algeſirees</hi> to
be<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hara,</hi> Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Rebuilt, and to Repair and Re-eſtabliſh
his other Lands and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
that had been ruin'd by the
paſſage he had given through them, to
all the Forces that came out of <hi>Africa</hi>
into <hi>Spain.</hi> Inſomuch that they caus'd
great ſumms of Money to be given
him, and granted great Franchizes and
Priviledges to all his Relations and
Followers. Whereupon he took his
leave of them, to repair home to ſet
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:39314:72"/>
all things again to Rights, and injoy, if
he could, the Sweets of the Revenge he
had taken of <hi>D. Rodrigo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, they fell in good earneſt
to conſider of regulating and policying
their new Kingdom, and of re-popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that great Country that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Deſert, by the flight of all the
Inhabitants. Wherefore ſeeing that
the <hi>Moors</hi> they had left in Garriſon in
the Cities and Burroughs where they
had paſs'd, had no Wives, tho they
were all very Young, and that it was
impoſſible to furniſh them with
enough from <hi>Africa,</hi> whence their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Mothers would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to ſuffer them to depart; they
caus'd Proclamation to be made by
ſound of Trumpet, throughout all
<hi>Spain,</hi> That all the Chriſtian Women
and Maidens, as well of the ancient
Inhabitants, as of whatever Nation
they were, that were willing to be
Converted, and Marry themſelves to
the Conquerours, ſhould enjoy the
ſame Priviledges and Prerogatives which
they enjoy'd before. They caus'd at
the ſame time, another Declaration
to be Publiſhed in favour of the
Gentlemen, to whom they offer'd
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:39314:73"/>
the Dividend of the Conquer'd
Lands.</p>
               <p>This Publication in a ſhort time,
either out of fear or intereſt, caus'd an
infinite number of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to change
their Religion, and the Women and
Maidens to reſolve upon matching
themſelves with the <hi>Moors.</hi> At that
time was it that the Arch-biſhop of
<hi>Oppas,</hi> who had been General of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigo</hi>'s
Army, that <hi>Tariff</hi> had beaten
and taken Priſoner in the ſecond Battel,
that had been fought near the River
<hi>Guadalete,</hi> as I have ſaid; and the
Arch-biſhop <hi>Toriſo,</hi> a very near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Unhappy King, abjur'd
their Faith to<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Nahic,</hi> Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> comply with <hi>Tariff</hi> and
<hi>Muca.</hi> Theſe two new <hi>Moors,</hi> to
manifeſt their Zeal, and acquire ſtill
more credit than they had with the
Generals, repreſented to them, that
to hinder the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from revolting
for the future, or retrieving Courage
with time, it was expedient through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to clear all the Mountains on the
Left Hand of <hi>Arragon,</hi> in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> call'd
<hi>Biſcaye,</hi> and the <hi>Aſturies;</hi> where they
gave them notice that ſeveral Perſons
of great Quality had made their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
with a great number of Souldiers;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:39314:73"/>
nay, and that there was at the head of
them ſuch Perſons as were Princes of
the Blood of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>D. Rodrigo</hi>'s
near Relations; without which their
Conqueſt would never be ſecure.</p>
               <p>This advice jump'd wholly with
<hi>Tariff</hi>'s ſence, who gave immediate
order to a <hi>Tartar,</hi> a very good Officer,
<hi>Abraham le Sujari</hi> by name, to take
ſix thouſand men of the Forces he had
by him, and likewiſe to draw as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as he ſhould need out of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and to march with the
two <hi>Renegado</hi>-Arch-biſhops, into the
afore-mention'd Mountains.</p>
               <p>At that time a Young Prince, a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the K. <hi>D. Rodrigo,</hi> call'd <hi>Pelage,</hi>
was retir'd thither with a good number
of reſolute men, that were willing to
follow his Fortune; and as he was
brave, and pretended to the Crown,
all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that had taking refuge
in the Mountains, had elected him
King; and certainly he made himſelf
appear to be very worthy of that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Dignity.</p>
               <p>General <hi>Abraham</hi> being come near

of War,</hi> thought convenient to ſend the
two Arch-biſhops to him; having
brought them along with him, that ſo
being his Relations and Friends, they
might the more eaſily perſwade him
to deſiſt from the Temerity of his
Enterprize; with orders to offer him

to him, as they ſhould judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
as well as to all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
that ſhould be with him. Whereupon
theſe Arch-biſhops being come into the
Country, and offering to make this
Propoſal to <hi>Pelage,</hi> he was ſo provok'd
at them, that he had them ſeiz'd on,
and both thrown from off the top of
a Rock, into a River that was at the
bottom. And as he had firſt been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by them of the Scituation of
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Camp, and the number of
his Forces, he aſſembled what men he
had, and went to attack them that
very ſame Night: And after having
defeated the greateſt part of the <hi>Moors,</hi>
he return'd into the heart of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
without any loſs. <hi>Abraham</hi> not
expecting this at all, and not ſeeing
the return of the two Renegadoes he
had brought along with him, fancy'd
they had betray'd him; and with the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:39314:74"/>
few men he had left, without making
any longer ſtay, he return'd with all
expedition to <hi>Toledo,</hi> where he dy'd of

Troops ſufficient in one Body to go

with leading upon the frontier the

                     <hi>Pelage</hi> takes the City of <hi>Gixa</hi>
from the <hi>Moors,</hi> and burns it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SInce that <hi>Pelage</hi> had once vanquiſh'd
the <hi>Moors,</hi> he did not doubt but
that he could defend himſelf in his
Mountains. All the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the
Neighbouring Provinces repair'd to him
after this Victory, flattering themſelves
with the hopes he might one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
them to their Liberty. Till then
they did not believe there to have been
any place in all <hi>Spain,</hi> where they could
ſhelter themſelves from the fury of thoſe
Conquerors, for as they had not any
Retreat where they could be in ſafety,
they ſuffer'd themſelves to be put into
Fetters. But the young People, that
had no Wives, aud were moſt proper
for Warfare, began to make their
Eſcapes, by little and little, out of the
<hi>Moors</hi> hands; and ſteal away by night
into the Mountains, where <hi>Pelage</hi> had
his abode, ſo to put themſelves under
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:39314:78"/>
his Protection. Inſomuch that in a
ſhort time there was a pretty conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Body of an Army aſſembled.
Wherefore ſeeing that General <hi>Abraham</hi>
was Retreated into <hi>Caſtile,</hi> he reſolv'd
to make ſome attempt as might accrue
to the Credit of his Party.</p>
               <p>With this Deſign, he drew together
the moſt men he could, and made up
a body of ſix thouſand men, with whom
he came to a ſmall City, call'd <hi>Gixa</hi> by
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and by the <hi>Arabs</hi> after
they had taken it, <hi>Takla.</hi> Wherefore
having block'd it up with this ſmall
Army, few <hi>Moors</hi> were there that
expected to be beleaguer'd by <hi>Pelage,</hi>
whom they did not think ſo hardly as
to budge out of the Tenure where he
had hold. Nevertheleſs they ſtood out
ſo obſtinately with the Captain that
commanded in the Place, that they
all dy'd bravely fighting, refuſing to
liſten to any Capitulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pelage</hi> much ſatisfy'd with this ſmall
Conqueſt, caus'd it to be fortify'd,
left there as Governour one of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
call'd <hi>Manuzes,</hi> and retired with
his men into the heart of the Mountain,
which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in their Tongue
call <hi>Oviedo. Tariff</hi> was much afflicted
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:39314:78"/>
at this bad ſueceſs. He then perceiv'd
that the <hi>Renegado</hi>-Biſhops had well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
him, when they would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
him to have render'd himſelf
maſter of that nook of Land; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
imagining that ſome miſchief
would come on't; after having given
order to the Troops that were in thoſe
parts to be ready, and ſent word to
<hi>Mahomet, Abenramin,</hi> Governour of
<hi>Toledo,</hi> to draw the moſt he could
together. He alſo ſent him Troops
from him, under one of his Captains,
call'd <hi>Abenhamza;</hi> who carry'd him an
order to attack <hi>Pelage.</hi> All their
Troops being aſſembled, were found to
make up a Body of twelve thouſand
good men, with whom <hi>Abenramin</hi>
bent his march towards the <hi>North.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pelage</hi> making no doubt of getting the
advantage this ſecond time as he had
done the former, reſolv'd upon waiting
the coming of the Enemy in that Town
he had newly conquer'd, with about
8000 men he then had with him.</p>
               <p>While he was preparing to go re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>Moors</hi> there, a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negado
gave him notice that his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Manuzes,</hi> had made an offer to
<hi>Tariff</hi> of delivering up to him that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:39314:79"/>
little City; nay, and to ſeize on his
Perſon. <hi>Pelage</hi> could not doubt of the
truth of what he told him, when he
had ſhew'd him a Letter he carry'd
from that General to <hi>Manuzes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
was the whole train of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
minuted againſt him. He high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entertain'd the <hi>Renegado;</hi> and after
having made him a world of Preſents,
he deſired him, ſince he expreſs'd ſo
much deſire to ſerve his Country, to
return to the <hi>Moors</hi> Camp, to tell
<hi>Abenramin</hi> that it was not yet time for
him to advance, <hi>Pelage</hi> not being yet
arriv'd in the Town with all his
Forces.</p>
               <p>The Renegado having accepted this
Commiſſion, made that forged anſwer
to <hi>Abenramin,</hi> who was very glad at
it, and ſent him forthwith back to
<hi>Gixa,</hi> to ſtay till the Prince was there
arriv'd, and to bring him immediate
word. But inſtead of going thither,
he went to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Camp.
<hi>Pelage</hi> not loſing time, march'd all the
night; and being acquainted with the
Country, he arriv'd at the Camp of
the <hi>Moors,</hi> without they having the
leaſt inckling of him, and attack'd
them with ſo much vigour, that he
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:39314:79"/>
kill'd a very great number of them,
and put all the reſt to flight; obliging
General <hi>Abenramin</hi> to Retreat in great
diſorder.</p>
               <p>In this Attack the <hi>Moors</hi> loſt two
thouſand men, and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
about eight hundred. But <hi>Pelage</hi>
fearing to ingage too far in the Battel
with <hi>Abenramin,</hi> who had double the
number of his men; and who, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
rally'd his Souldiers that had been
taken unprovided, might ſurround him;
he made a haſty retreat to the Town
of <hi>Gixa;</hi> where as ſoon as he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
he caus'd the Traytor <hi>Manuzes</hi> to
be hang'd, and his Body burnt. Then
for fear the <hi>Moors</hi> might take that
Town again, after having turn'd out
all its Inhabitants, he ſet fire to't, and
Retreated into the Mountains to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their entrance againſt the <hi>Moors,</hi>
by whom he was under fear of being
purſu'd.</p>
               <p>And indeed <hi>Abenramin</hi> follow'd <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage</hi>
at the heels; ſo as that he arriv'd
at <hi>Gixa</hi> before the fire was quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.
Whereupon having croſs'd it
without making any ſtay, that he
might endeavour to overtake <hi>Pelage,</hi>
he found him poſted at the ſame Place
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:39314:80"/>
where General <hi>Abraham</hi> was defeated.
He found this Poſt too difficult to force,
that he durſt not undertake it, for fear
of not ſucceeding; and contenting
himſelf with garniſhing well that fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
he bent his march back to <hi>Toledo</hi>
with all his Army, being aſham'd at
his having perform'd ſo little in this
Expedition. He ſignify'd to <hi>Tariff</hi> all
that had paſs'd, while he expected his
orders, which he deſired he would ſend
him; and this General ſignify'd to him
to ſeparate his Troops, and remain in
his Government till farther order.
This caus'd <hi>Abenramin</hi> to diſmiſs his
Army, and ſeek to recreate himſelf
after the fatigues of this War.</p>

               <p>COunt <hi>Julian</hi> having taken leave of
the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Generals, as has been
ſaid in the former Chapter, aſſembled all
his Adherents, as well Relations, as thoſe
that had follow'd his Fortune; and ſeeing
the bad condition the <hi>Algeſires,</hi> and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lands were in, he went to ſettle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a very pleaſant place, that is
upon the back of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi>
Sea, call'd by the <hi>Spaniards Villa Vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa;</hi>
from whence he could give the
orders neceſſary for the reparation of
all his Houſes, and the adminiſtration
of the vaſt Eſtate he had. As ſoon as
he was there arriv'd, he ſent to his
Wife and Daughter to come to him.
They had ever made their abode at

fail'd not to repair immediately to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:39314:81"/>
The Count and Counteſs were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd

                     <hi>Alfirac,</hi> Abſence.</note>; only <hi>Florinda</hi>
continu'd ſtill melancholly, whatever
Careſſes were made her by her Father

<hi>Chriſtians;</hi> the Death, Servitude, or
at leaſt, the Miſery of ſo many Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men; and when ſhe call'd to
mind that ſhe was the occaſion of ſo
many evils, ſhe was not capable of
any joy: Above all, what gave her
moſt anxiety, was to ſee her ſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour'd,
and without hopes of ever
ſeeing her ſelf in the Rank and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
ſhe might have expected
according to her condition. All this
ſo Topſy-turvy'd her mind, that at
the long-run, either through the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Devil, or through a
black vapour that offuſcated her Brain;
ſhe mounted to the top of a Tower,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Alhueran,</hi> Deſpair.</note>
where ſhutting the Door after her, for
fear of being hinder'd from Executing

a Governant to go ſeek her Father
and Mother, with whom ſhe had a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:39314:81"/>
mind to ſpeak. And as ſoon as they
were come, ſhe began to ſpeak to
them from the top of the Tower, as a
Perſon that had abſolutely loſt her
ſenſes; telling them, that ſo unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
a Maid as ſhe did not deſerve to
live, principally being the cauſe of ſo
great a Deſolation<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Alfacar,</hi> Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>, as that of all
<hi>Spain;</hi> and continuing ſuch like Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes;
<hi>My Father and Mother,</hi> cry'd
ſhe to them, <hi>Henceforward in memory
of my misfortune, let not this City any
longer be call'd</hi> Villa Vitioſa, <hi>but</hi> Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;
<hi>for now the worst Perſon that ever
was, is going to dye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No ſooner had ſhe utter'd theſe laſt

were there, and without yielding to
the Remonſtrances they made her,
ſhe threw herſelf from off the top of
that Tower; and having batter'd her
ſelf in falling, ſhe only liv'd three days.
Her Mother ſwoon'd away at this
Spectacle, and Count <hi>Julian</hi> laid ſo
to heart the misfortune of a Maiden
for whom he had had ſo much kindneſs,
that his imagination remaining wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

himſelf Stabb'd a Ponyard into his own

Death, the Counteſs his Wife fell ſick

Death.</p>
               <p>As they left no Legitimate Children,
<hi>Almanzor</hi> took Poſſeſſion of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
and Re-united them to the

a great ſcandal, both among the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Moors;</hi> and that Town is call'd
<hi>Malaca,</hi> on occaſion of the laſt words
<hi>Florinda</hi> utter'd at her dying, when ſhe
threw her ſelf off from the top of the
Tower. The <hi>Spaniands</hi> ſay <hi>Malaga</hi> in

of the two ſhe was heard to utter at
her Death; for ſhe ſaid, Let this Town

contains about Eighteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Miles in Circumference; and
ſtretches out into a Length, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Figure of an Animal. The
Climate is exempt from bad Vapours;
the Air is there ever Serene and refreſh'd
by the Winds, which occaſions the
People to be long Liv'd and very Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
the Plains are water'd with an Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Springs that fall from the Rocks,
whoſe Water is very ſubtile and well
taſted. All theſe Waters collected
from ſpace to ſpace, from Noble Rivers,
the moſt of which have their Courſe

the People with a World of Fiſh of a

very good Taſte, and not Unhealthful.
We ſee no Serpents there, nor any
Wild Beaſts; there are no Leopards
nor Lyons, Ounces or Griffins: And
when any of thoſe Creatures have been
ſometimes brought thither from other
Countries, they could not live. This
occaſions the Country to be very Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,

there being ſo many Trees in the

Horſes, and have ſuch as are very

Bread and excellent Wine, and ſo great
a quantity of Oyl, that there is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too much than too little. There
grows all ſorts of Herbs and Pulſe;
and particularly, all Simples as are
needful in Phyſick. They gather there
Silk and Linnen in abundance, of
which they make very fine Stuffs.
There are Mines of Silver, of Copper,
of Lead, of Iron, and Quick-ſilver:
For as for Gold, I have not heard there
was any. As there are many different

them all ſort of good uſage, as
Generals of Armies are wont to do in
ſuch occaſions.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants, without liſtening to
his Promiſes, or being concern'd at his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:39314:91"/>
Threats, made no other anſwer, but
that they were reſolv'd to defend the
goodneſs of their Cauſe to the laſt,
and to be cut all in pieces, rather than
fall under Slavery.</p>
               <p>After ſuch an Anſwer, <hi>Adilbar</hi>
thought there was no farther parlying.
On the morrow morning, he caus'd a
moſt furious Aſſault to be made: But as
the Beſieged were well inform'd of the
manner with which the <hi>Moors</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
the Sieges of all the other
Towns of <hi>Spain,</hi> they had made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of a world of Poſts of ſeveral
faſhions, which they fill'd with boyling
Oyl, <hi>Juniper</hi> and <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and threw
them upon the Beſiegers; which burnt
them alive, and incapacitated them
from fighting, by reaſon of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the pain they ſuffer'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Farica.</note>
                  <hi>Adilbar</hi> confus'd and vex'd at the
damage his men had receiv'd from
the Beleaguer'd, without its being in
his Power to do them any, caus'd the
Rerreat to be ſounded, and his Troops
put into Quarters, to ſee what he had
to do: He had loſt four hundred men
in this firſt Aſſault, and plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
that as often as he employ'd
force, there would be nothing to be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:39314:91"/>
got. Wherefore he imagin'd, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Maſter of the Field, and having
Victuals abundance in his Army, whoſe
ſubſiſtance he could furniſh to as long
as he pleas'd, in the Neighbourhood
of that Town, he could ſo well block
up the Avenues, that it ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to Surrender, without his ſo
much as loſing one man; he reſolv'd not
to decamp thence till he had famiſh'd it.</p>
               <p>The Beleaguer'd gueſſing that the
<hi>Moors</hi> had taken this courſe, ſince they
had remained five and twenty days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
without continuing their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks;
they reſolv'd to Sally out upon
them, when as they leaſt expected it.
For this purpoſe, without making any
Buſtle, as could make the Beſiegers
ſuſpect their Deſign, they aſſembled
all their reſolute<note n="*" place="margin">Inzi, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi, <hi>Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</hi>
                  </note> men; And one Night,
Sallying out of one of their Gates, they
fell with much vigour upon <hi>Adilbar</hi>'s
Camp.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> defended themſelves with
great Reſolution, but believing the
number of their Enemies ſtill greater
than it was, in the darkneſs that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
them from viewing one another,
they betook themſelves to flight<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Fazar,</hi> a Rout.</note>, and
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> made a great ſlaughter of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:39314:92"/>
them. To avoid the inconveniences
that commonly happen in Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are perform'd by Night,
the Governour had order'd all thoſe
that were commanded out upon that
Sally, to ceaſe fighting, and retire into
the Town, as ſoon as he ſhould cauſe
a Horn to be ſounded; whoſe ſound
he had caus'd them to obſerve. Thus
fearing they might engage too far on
the purſuit of the <hi>Moors,</hi> who might
cut them off, he caus'd it to be ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when he judg'd it convenient.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had much ado to
reſolve upon quitting the Engagement,
being very much fleſh'd by the <hi>Moors,</hi>
who gave way before them on all ſides,
and were purſu'd by them with the
Sword in their Reins: But at the long
run, retiring by little and little, in the
order that had been preſcrib'd them, they
re-entred the Town, where they were
receiv'd with great Applauſes, by the
Beleaguer'd; who caus'd a world of
Muſical Inſtruments to be ſounded, in
token of Joy for ſo great a Victory.</p>
               <p>The Day being come, the ſlaughter
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had made appear'd to
<hi>Adilbar</hi> much greater than he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
it: And perceiving the ſtrength
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:39314:92"/>
of this Town, and the Valour of thoſe
that defended it, he found it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to raiſe the Siege, than to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
any longer obſtinately in an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
which was more difficult than he
had imagin'd. Whereupon he took
his march back to <hi>Cordoua;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found his Army diminiſh'd in two
thouſand Foot, and two hundred
Horſe, he had loſt in this Siege, he
ſeparated it, and put it into good
Quarters in the Country, that it
might recover it ſelf.</p>

                  <hi>ADilbar</hi> was diſconſolate at the bad
event of the firſt Enterprize he
had made for the <hi>Valid</hi>'s Service: He
was aſham'd that the only Town the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> held in <hi>Spain,</hi> had reſiſted
him, after <hi>Tariff,</hi> with ſo little pains,
had taken all the reſt. He imagin'd

               <p>Wherefore having ſent for all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of thoſe Provinces, and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with them about the neceſſity, and
the means for the reducing it; he began
to make greater Preparations than he
had yet done; and having aſſembled
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:39314:93"/>
fifteen thouſand Foot, and fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horſe, he took the Field in the
beginning of the Spring<note n="*" place="margin">Fael Arabeh, <hi>Spring.</hi>
                  </note>, of the <hi>95th</hi>
Year of the <hi>Hegira,</hi> and march'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to <hi>Hiſpalis;</hi> in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
whereof, he lodg'd all his
Troops.</p>
               <p>The tryal he had made in the firſt
Siege, of the Valour and Induſtry of
the Beleaguer'd, which had made him
break up from thence, without having
effected the leaſt, had render'd him
wiſe; and as he was a good<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Harbal Ahidad,</hi> Genius for War.</note> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
he had caus'd certain Chariots
to be made, cover'd with very thick
Boards, that ſo his Souldiers might, as
under cover, fight ſhelter'd, without
any inconvenience from the Boyling
Oyl, and all the other things, that the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> might throw from off their
Walls.</p>
               <p>After having begun, by Summoning
the Town again to Surrender, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
thence as haughty an Anſwer as
that he had before, he caus'd his cover'd
Chariots to advance, with a multitude
of Pioneers, ſuſtained by a good
number of Souldiers, that he had
plac'd underneath; and having brought
them near the Courtin, he had it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermin'd
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:39314:94"/>
in the Places he judg'd to
be the weakeſt.</p>
               <p>The Beleaguer'd ſeeing theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines,
and dreading the effect of them,
aſſembled to conſult about the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
means to ſecure themſelves from ſo
great a danger. Their Governour,
call'd <hi>Sarmato,</hi> being a Man of Wit
and Reſolution, let them ſee that there
was no occaſion for them to be alarm'd
as they were, and caus'd them to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into three Brigades, that they
might the more eaſily ſuſtain the three
different Attacks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adilbar</hi> had not omitted any one of
the Precautions he could imagine,
againſt all that the Beleaguer'd could
invent for their defence; and as he
had caus'd to be made a kind of great
Stone-Bows<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Arabs</hi> call them <hi>Mauſenech.</hi>
                  </note>, with which they ſhot up
very great Stones, he pointed them to
the places where they could do moſt
miſchief; and making 'em mount
upon his Chariots, he caus'd ſo great a
quantity of 'em to be thrown, that
few places were there in the City,
where the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> could be in
ſafety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sarmato</hi> ſeeing ſo many extraordinary
means employ'd to attack him, fell on his
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:39314:94"/>
ſide alſo to the contriving ſome for his
Defence; and having caus'd the ſtrongeſt
of the Inhabitants to aſſemble, with fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Inſtruments for the removing the
Earth, he caus'd Ramparts to be rais'd,
behind and within the Walls, that
when even the <hi>Moors</hi> ſhould have effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the making ſome Breaches therein,
they might find 'em ſtopt with ſo much
Earth, as that it would be impoſſible
for them to enter 'em. This wiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
by this Precaution, put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a poſture of receiving no damage
from all the Inventions of his Enemies:
For there was already ſo much Earth
behind the Wall, that when they had
broken it, they would find they had
got nothing by the bargain: Nay,
and many had been cruſh'd to pieces
by the great Stones the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> roll'd
upon thoſe Chariots: And as for thoſe
the <hi>Moors</hi> caus'd to be thrown into the
Town, as there ſtood Sentinels on the
top of the Towers, to give the Signal
to the Inhabitants to make their eſcape,
when they ſaw any coming, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
all their Machines were fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adilbar</hi> being in Deſpondency at ſo
many ill ſucceſſes, reſolv'd upon giving
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:39314:95"/>
a general Aſſault. While he was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all his Forces for that purpoſe,
and that the Scaling, Ladders were
erected on one ſide, he caus'd his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots
to take a great circuit towards
the other end of the City, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
the Wall at the ſame
time. Whereupon, having given
the Signal for the attack, at break
of day, which he had choſen for
that intent, the Beſiegers went on
with an extraordinary fury, and the
Beſieged ſuſtain'd it with great reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> in the mean while, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
again chang'd their Chariots, and
faſtening upon part of the Wall that
was weaker than the reſt, made a great
Breach, by which ſome enter'd the
Town; but <hi>Sarmato</hi> repairing in all
haſt thither, with a great many Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
left them there not long; and
having drove them thence, caus'd that
gap to be ſtopt up with a great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Earth: Certain it is, the Town
had been taken, had he delay'd one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
longer; but the Night having
put an end to the Conflict, <hi>Adilbar</hi>
found he had loſt five hundred men,
whereas the Beſieged had loſt but two
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:39314:95"/>
hundred: So great an oppoſition made
him take up again the Reſolution he
took the time before, of ſtopping up
all the Avenues of the Town, that ſo
the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> being preſs'd by hunger
and thirſt, might be conſtrain'd to Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render.
He remain'd there in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
forty five days, after which, <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mato</hi>
conſidering that <hi>Adilbar</hi> might
hold him block'd up in this manner,
as much, and as long as he pleas'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Maſter of the Field, from whence
he might have all ſorts of Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
he reſolv'd upon going to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
him in his Camp, as he had done
the time before.</p>
               <p>Wherefore having aſſembled twelve
hundred Foot, choice men, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horſe, he caus'd them to Sally
out at Mid-night, through a Poſtern gate
of the Town. The <hi>Moors</hi> having
ſeen the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had been ſo long
without fighting, did not expect this
ſudden Aſſault at all: By this means
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> kill'd a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them, and retired in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
by favour of the night. <hi>Adilbar</hi>
fearing the like accident to that which
befell him in the former Siege, ſent
a part of his Horſe to ſtop the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:39314:96"/>
that were minded to purſue them;
inſomuch, that he found the next day
that he had loſt four hundred Foot, and
thirty Horſe, whereas there fell not
above a hundred and fifty of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
whom this General caus'd to be
Interr'd as well as the <hi>Moors,</hi> for fear
of their creating an Infection in his
Camp.</p>
               <p>The Beſieged were much ſatisfy'd
with the ſucceſs of this ſecond Sally;
but in a ſhort time after, <hi>Adilbar</hi> caus'd
a ſecond aſſault to be made, which
was ſo furious, that whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
they made, the <hi>Moors</hi> at length
gain'd a Courtine. The Governour
flying thither forthwith with a re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement
of Souldiers, perform'd ſo
well, that he at laſt drove the <hi>Moors</hi>
again from their Poſt, and put it into
a poſture of Defence. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
laſted from break of day, till
Three of the Clock in the<note n="*" place="margin">This time is call'd <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick.</hi>
                  </note> Afternoon;
when <hi>Adilbar</hi> ſeeing his men diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
caus'd a Retreat to be ſounded,
to dreſs the wounded. He found among
the Dead three hundred <hi>Moors,</hi> and
about a hundred and fifty <hi>Chriſtians;</hi>
but there was a very great number
wounded; and among others, one of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:39314:96"/>
his Officers, called <hi>Hali Abenzainee,</hi>
which afflicted him very much, and
whom he caus'd carefully to be dreſs'd,
as well as all the reſt; confirming
himſelf in the firſt Reſolution he had
taken, of having the Town by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p>The Beſieged fearing to want Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
that they might precaution them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
before-hand, with the remedies
neceſſary againſt the miſchief where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they were threatned, had caus'd
very deep<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hazir,</hi> Ditches,</note> Canals to be made, from
the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Gate of their Town to a
great River, that paſſing very near
their Walls, falls afterwards into the
Sea. By the means of theſe Canals,
they went into the River with great
Boats; and theſe Canals being Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
all along with good Trenches,
inſomuch that the Cavalry could not
do them any miſchief, there came to
them, from time to time, Victuals
from the Mountains of a certain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
call'd <hi>Biſcaya:</hi> Theſe Canals were
a very great help to the Beſieged; for

upon raiſing the Siege once again:
When news was brought him of the

               <p>So urgent an evil, and which he ſaw

               <p>By the means of this Renunciation,
<hi>Aboulvalid Abenacer</hi> being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
Crown'd King, his Father
<hi>Almanzor</hi> took a choſen number of his
moſt Faithful and moſt Ancient Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
to attend and ſerve him in the
Place he had reſolv'd upon making his
Retreat, leaving his Youngeſt Son
<hi>Abraham Amcari,</hi> with the King, his
Eldeſt; and no ſooner was he arriv'd
in that Solitude, but that his Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
daily augmenting, he fell into an
ill Diſtemper, which laſted upon him
till Death, which, in ſhort, fell out in
a little time after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> had a haughty Spirit, and
and mmenſe Ambition; the <hi>Caliph</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very jealous of him, and uneaſie on
his ſcore, that he might deprive him of
the means of fomenting Cabals againſt
him, ſent him into Stony <hi>Arabia,</hi> which
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:39314:102"/>
is a Country of very ſmall extent; and
where he could not find wherewithal to
do him any great miſchief.</p>
               <p>About that time the Governour of
<hi>Damas, Abenbukar</hi> by name, who all
his life long had had roving and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
thoughts, imagin'd that <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi>
being no longer in the World, he
might attempt all with impunity. He
thought of no leſs than of diſpoſſeſſing
<hi>Aboulvalid,</hi> and of placing himſelf in
his ſtead; and had aſſembled a great
Army, with which he ravag'd all the
Provinces bordering upon his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The <hi>Caliph</hi> was alſo oblig'd
on his ſide to take the Field, to bring
him to his Duty; when that Prince
<hi>Abraham Amcari,</hi> who was continually
gnaw'd with the luſt of Reigning, and
omitting nothing he judg'd uſeful to
his Deſigns<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Alhadar,</hi> loſt no occaſion.</note>, found it to be the moſt
propitious juncture he could wiſh, for
the manifeſting them to the World.
Whereupon he on his ſide aſſembled the
moſt Horſe and Foot that was poſſible
for him; and after having paſs'd the
Deſarts of <hi>Arabia</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Alcahari,</hi> Sandy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</note>, he march'd direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Court with all his forces, making
ſemblance of coming to his Brothers
aſſiſtance againſt <hi>Abenbukar</hi> the Rebel.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:39314:103"/>
And accordingly he met with a kind
welcome at firſt; but having all on the
ſudden changed face, and having ſeiz'd
on the Caſtle, and the beſt Gates of the
City, about midnight he ſent to ſeize
on the principal perſons of the Court,
as well Officers as people of Service,
whom he thought Loyal to his Brother,
and had 'em all beheaded. This ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidated
all the reſt, that either out
of the fear they had of him, or by reaſon
of the little affection they bore the
King, and the eſteem they had for this
Prince, whom they ſaw to be brave and
generous, and love War<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ymala,</hi> to win hearts.</note>, they were
eaſily inclin'd to acknowledge him for
their King; nay, and there was ſo great
a concourſe of People at his Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that meaning to improve that firſt
heat he ſaw them in, and not thinking
it convenient to let it cool again, he
took the Field with all thoſe that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
themſelves to eſpouſe his Party.
His Brother <hi>Aboulvalid</hi> was gone at the
head of his Forces againſt <hi>Abenbukar;</hi>
wherefore he thought he could eaſily
pen him up, between his own Army,
and that of that Rebel. And after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left at Court a Captain, a Creature
of his, call'd <hi>Xaira Alxadali,</hi> in whom
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:39314:103"/>
he put entire confidence, he march'd
directly to his Brother with all his
Troops; which he found to make up
twenty thouſand Foot, and fifteen
hundred Horſe.</p>
               <p>The King was ſo ſurpriz'd at this
News<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aturmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> Ill News.</note>, that he was ready to run mad;
and to ſee if he could apply ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
to ſo great and un-foreſeen an
Evil, he quitted the deſign of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<hi>Abenbukar,</hi> to return with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
to meet his Brother.</p>
               <p>The two Armies being in ſight of
one another, <hi>Aboulvalid</hi> ſent a man
on purpoſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to divert him
from ſo unjuſt and unreaſonable an
Enterprize; and repreſenting to him
that he was going to be the occaſion of
the Death of an infinite number of
men, which could be only imputed to
him alone; but that if he would deſiſt
from his deſign, he promis'd him in
the word of a King, to forget all that
was paſs'd, and to receive him as his
Friend and Brother<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Taha,</hi> obedience, protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note>. <hi>Abraham</hi> made
no other anſwer to this, but that he
was not come thither to be reconcil'd,
but to fight; that he ſtood in no need
of the friendſhip he offer'd him, but of
the Crown he had upon his Head;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:39314:104"/>
that he was <hi>Almanzor</hi>'s Son and Heir
as well as he; that he had only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
to defend himſelf, and that their
Rights being at the point of their
Swords, they would that day decide
which of the two had the beſt, giving
the Kingdom to him that ſhould gain
the Victory.</p>
               <p>Having in this manner ſent back
<hi>Aboulvalid</hi>'s mediator, and having
threatned to have him hang'd, if he
came again to importune him with ſuch
like harrangues. The <hi>Caliph</hi> with grief
ſaw himſelf oblig'd to give Battel; but
at laſt, having marſhall'd all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in Battalia, it began with ſome
ſquadrons of Horſe of both ſides, who
were a long while mingled with one
another, before any judgment could
be paſs'd which of the two had the
advantage: And this Skirmiſh that
laſted above half the day, without
any great loſs on either ſide, plainly
ſhew'd the Cavalry to be compos'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of good men, that knew admirably
well both to attack and defend.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, the twelfth of the
Moon <hi>Dulquehala</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In the month of <hi>December,</hi> in the year 717.</note>, in the Year 96,
the Battel was renew'd, and prov'd

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:39314:104"/>
it laſted from Morning till Noon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ones being able to judge on which
ſide the Victory lean'd: But at length,
<hi>Aboulvalid</hi>'s people beginning to buckle,
and thoſe of <hi>Abraham</hi> to break in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them on all ſides, <hi>Aboulvalid</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to fall into his Brothers hands,
made his eſcape out of the hotteſt of
the Engagement, upon a very fleet Horſe,
after having made a ſign to ſome of
his people to follow him. The Kings

               <p>The Prince purſu'd them at their

to ſee that all the paces he made,
conducted him upon the Throne,
without any ſtop, he march'd directly
to Court; where having conven'd the
Eſtates, to confirm the Government
he meant to eſtabliſh, he caus'd them
there to take a new Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to him, by which, all that he had
not been able to get approv'd of, but
by ſome, before his going to fight his

by all the reſt: And thus was he
own'd and declar'd by a common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
Emperour of all <hi>Almanzor</hi>'s

               <p>Then having made ſuch Regalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as he pleas'd, and beſtow'd great
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:39314:105"/>
Bounties on all his Creatures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>

him with an Army of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

inſomuch, that they were not long

would needs, before he gave the Signal

he had not any Right to the Crown,
he could not believe he would perſiſt
in his bad deſigns, or that he would be
wanting in his Allegiance to his Prince;
wherefore he offer'd to Pardon him all

               <p>
                  <hi>Abenbukar</hi> having caus'd the Princes

not go about to excuſe himſelf with

but anſwer'd him ſharply, and like a
gallant man, That between two Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and two Diſloyaliſts, as they both
were, he had only the hand of him:
but that <hi>Abraham</hi> had committed a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:39314:106"/>
much greater infidelity in diſpoſſeſſing
his Brother <hi>Aboulvalid,</hi> who was his
Lawful King, according to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of his Father, and that of Nature,
than he, in withdrawing himſelf from
his obedience, with all the Province of
which he was Governour, ſeeing all
his people oppreſs'd with impoſitions<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Magarem,</hi> Subſidies.</note>,
and very ſeverely us'd by King <hi>Aboul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he had learnt that to ſtate
things aright, Nature caus'd no body
to be born upon a Throne; that all the
Kings of the Earth were Tyrants; that
the Scepter belong'd to him to whom
God had given the ſtrength to bear it;
and the Soveraign Authority to him
that had Wiſdom and Ability ſufficient
to govern the people; and that as all
Created things had their beginning, and
their end, Monarchies were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from this general viciſſitude;
that thus there was no need of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any farther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> being extremely provok'd
at ſo haughty and ſo inſolent an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
would no longer defer giving

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:39314:106"/>
that were not yet arriv'd, <hi>Abubenkar</hi>'s
Army being much ſtronger than his,
and all his Troops appearing much
more ſprightful; but they could not
prevail with him to change the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had taken.</p>
               <p>Some of the Cavalry that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd
on both ſides, having began the
Skirmiſh, they quickly engag'd in a
general Battel, that was very obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
fought, and very bloody, <hi>Aben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukar</hi>
being skill'd in all the ſtratagems
of War, had plac'd his beſt Officer in

hundred choſen Horſe, that had order
not to appear till the Battel was far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd,
and then to attack the Princes
men in the Rear; and this occaſion'd
<hi>Abenbukar</hi>'s winning the Battel: For
this Captain, bolting juſt in the nick

of Battel, return'd to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> loaded
with Honour, and the Spoils of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Camp he had plunder'd; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:39314:107"/>
to have ſuddenly another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
upon his back, he did not diſmiſs
his, but put it only into good Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in that Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham,</hi> at his return, having met
with a very cool reception from the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> it ſpighted him extremely,
and gave him great confuſion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having again conven'd the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and Commanders that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his ſway, he gave them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that he was reſolv'd not to ſuffer
<hi>Abenbukar</hi> to glory long in his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and commanded them to make
ready to take the Field in fifty days
ſpace, with all the Forces they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their charge. They ſo very
punctually executed this order, that at
the day appointed, he found himſelf at
the head of an Army of forty thouſand
Foot, and five thouſand Horſe; with
which he march'd again for <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abenbukar</hi> had not ſlept on his ſide,
and knowing the great preparations
that were making againſt him, caus'd
Proclamation to be made throughout
all the neighbouring Countries, of
large pay, and great Rewards, for all
thoſe that would come into his ſervice,
and bring him Troops: By this means
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:39314:107"/>
he fram'd a body of thirty thouſand
Foot, and three thouſand Horſe; and
with theſe Forces ſtaid Prince <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
coming up, who without entring
into any parleys, as he had done the
time before, as ſoon as he came in fight
of <hi>Abenbukar</hi>'s Army, he march'd direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon him, to engage him in the
Battel, that was very bloody on both
ſides. But at laſt, <hi>Abenbukar</hi>'s Troops
being defeated, he was taken generouſly
fighting, and brought to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
who, without ſaying a word to him,
in the rage he was in, and without
giving him time to ſpeak, or the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
to come, he cut his Throat
with his own hands, ſtriking him ſo
furious a blow with his Scimitar up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the nape of his Neck, that he cut
off his Head, which he caus'd to be
put on the top of a Pike, on the Gate
of <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> He was not ſatisfy'd
with having himſelf perform'd the
Execution, for having caus'd him to
be fleed, he commanded the placing
upon that ſame Gate that Wretches
Skin, which he had caus'd to be fill'd
with ſtraw; and the like uſage did
all thoſe meet with that had had a
hand in this Rebellion. At length,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:39314:108"/>
being grown weary of putting people
to Death, and believing that Province
abſolutely reduc'd, and ſufficiently
chaſtiz'd, he left there as Governour,
a Captain, in whom he had great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
call'd <hi>Abencirix,</hi> and return'd
to recreate himſelf at Court, where he
was receiv'd by his Partizans with great
Huzzahs, and mighty Exultation.</p>

Native of Stony <hi>Arabia,</hi> and arriv'd
ſafe at <hi>Thunis</hi> with all his Army, at the

               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:39314:110"/>
There he found King <hi>Aboulvalid</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in Shipping the Troops he had
got together in thoſe parts; who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
him very affectionately, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs'd
him to a high degree. This Prince
had already nominated <hi>Tariff Abenziet,</hi>
who had atchiev'd the Conqueſt of the
Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> in his Fathers Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
<hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of all his Forces, and
had caſt his Eyes upon him, as upon
the greateſt, and moſt lucky Captain
of thoſe times.</p>
               <p>Theſe two great Armies having been
a long while in embarking, the King
put at length to Sea, and with as fair
a Wind as he could wiſh, in a few days
time he arriv'd in <hi>Arabia;</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made a Review of all his Troops,
his Army was found to be ſixty five
thouſand Foot, and five thouſand
Horſe, which gave him a great deal of
Joy.</p>
               <p>All the People of that Coaſt, ſeeing
ſo numerous and ſo flouriſhing an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
far from oppoſing his Deſcent,
declar'd themſelves immediately for
him.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, Prince <hi>Abraham</hi>
knowing all his Brothers Preparations,
did not ſleep on his ſide. He had aſſembled
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:39314:111"/>
all the Chiefs<note n="*" place="margin">Muſta Mahami, <hi>States.</hi>
                  </note> of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and after
having given 'em notice of the ſtorm
wherewith they were threatned, and
having made them apprehend that they
were to expect little leſs than to be
ſtrangled, if <hi>Aboulvalid</hi> ever re-mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Throne; and that it was
much better to dye in the Bed of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
than upon a Scaffold, as he was
reſolv'd to do, to ſhew 'em the way.
They were all ſo ſenſibly perſwaded by
his Arguments, that in their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
they made up a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Army, that was found to be ſixty

               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> having made no difficulty
to go meet his Brother with his Forces,
the Battel was fought in the Plain of

Sun riſing to its ſetting. <hi>Abraham</hi> then
perform'd all that could be done by a
great General, and a good Souldier:
But ſeeing his Army in Diſorder, he
threw himſelf into the hotteſt of the
Engagement, where he was kill'd with
his Sword in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aboulvalid</hi> did much lament his not
having been able to take him alive; and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:39314:111"/>
doubtleſs, as he had ever had a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for him, maugre all the miſchief
he had done him, he would have given
him his life, and would have been
contented with continuing him in a
perpetual impriſonment. Wherefore
having caus'd his Body to be put into
a Coffin, he purſu'd his way towards
<hi>Carbal,</hi> whence the Queen his Wife
was coming to meet him; tho ſhe had
ever been kept as a Priſoner, the Prince
had ever had her very civilly treated:
<hi>Aboulvalid</hi> was mighty joyful to ſee
her again, but could not forbear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
much grief for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
death; he caus'd the whole Court to
put on<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hiſu,</hi> mourning, tears.</note> mourning, and aſſiſted at his
Funeral, which he caus'd to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
with great Pomp; nay, he was
ſeen to ſhed tears in that occaſion; but
he had not the ſame mildneſs and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
for all the Officers that ſided
with his Brother; he put a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them to Death, and ſet himſelf
to retrieve his Authority, and ſet
matters again to rights throughout the
whole Empire.</p>
               <p>General <hi>Tariff</hi> receiv'd a wound in
his Right Arm in the Battel, which he
had neglected at firſt, by not refrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:39314:112"/>
to mount on Horſeback, after his
uſual manner; but through the little
care he took of it, and through the
toyl and drudgery of marching, his
Arm ſwell'd in ſuch manner as to gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre;
and ſo in a few days time ſent
him out of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aboulvalid</hi> was much griev'd at the
loſs of ſo great a General, and to ſhew
the eſteem he had for him, he caus'd
him to be Interr'd with great magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficency,
and had the ſame honours
paid him, as had been paid to the
Perſon of his Brother. And I can
certainly ſay one thing of him that is
ſomewhat ſingular, that his Valour
was accompany'd with ſuch great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in War, that he never undertook
any enterprize but what he ſped in to
his honour.</p>
               <p>This Prince, after having puniſh'd, as I
have ſaid, thoſe that were revolted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, began with recompencing
thoſe that had ſerv'd him ſo uſefully in
that War, by diſtributing among them
the Governments, Lieutenancies, and
Employs, inſomuch, that they were all
ſatisfy'd with the returns he made to
their Services; and then ſet his thoughts
upon enjoying amid Pleaſure, the repoſe
that had coſt him ſo dear.</p>

order from King <hi>Aboulvalid</hi> his Maſter,
to go the ſooneſt he could, to make
the Conqueſt of thoſe Mountains,
where <hi>Pelage</hi> had made his Retreat,
and where an infinite number of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
were gone to find him, from all the
corners of <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſave themſelves,
with their Wives and Children, from
the fury of the <hi>Moors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon, he ſent a Renegado-ſpy,
to examine the ſtrength of thoſe Places
where this Prince lurk'd, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the number of the Souldiers
he had with him, and the world
of People that had there taken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:39314:113"/>
The Renegado being entred into
the Country, pretended to make his
eſcape as well as the other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
from the Perſecution of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and
over-ran all the Mountains of <hi>Biſcaya,</hi>
where he moſt carefully obſerv'd all he
ſaw, in purſuance of the orders he had
receiv'd from <hi>Adilbar:</hi> But when upon
his departure thence again, he was
brought before <hi>Pelage,</hi> by the Guards he
had plac'd upon the Frontiers, having been
taken for a ſpy as he really was; <hi>Pelage</hi>
ask'd him a Thouſand Queſtions, but
as he was cunning and crafty, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
very pertinently, and without
being at a loſs: <hi>Pelage</hi> nevertheleſs
was not willing to let him go, and
kept him ſome days in Priſon; but at
length, finding nothing againſt him
but a weak ſuſpicion, with which his
Imagination had been poſſeſs'd, he ſet
him at liberty.</p>
               <p>After this, the Renegado took his
time ſo well, that he found the means
to get again to <hi>Cordoua,</hi> where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
<hi>Adilbar</hi> an account of all that
had befaln him, and of all he had
ſeen; aſſuring him, that it was no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
matter to force the paſs of thoſe
Mountains, that were guarded only
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:39314:113"/>
by a ſmall handful of men, of little
Courage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adilbar</hi> being incourag'd by this
Relation, reſolv'd upon undertaking
the War againſt <hi>Pelage,</hi> well perceiving
that if he had once reduc'd the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
of that Canton, <hi>Hiſpalis</hi> would
no longer put him in pain, the ſuccours
that Town had receiv'd from <hi>Biſcaya,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
occaſion'd it's not being ſurrendred.
Wherefore he prepar'd ſuddenly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege
it, as not believing thoſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
could reſiſt him long; and
flattering himſelf with the hopes of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<hi>Aboulvalid</hi> the abſolute Maſter
of all <hi>Spain,</hi> as far as the <hi>Pyrenean</hi>
Mountains, that ſeparate it from <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this purpoſe he aſſembled twelve

them the means of oppoſing him;
and their unanimous opinion was, to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:39314:114"/>
think of defending the Entrance of the

this was alſo the ſentiment of <hi>Pelage;</hi>
ſo as that having plac'd five hundred

in a great Quarry or Den, that
is under a ſteep Rock, <hi>Pelage</hi> plac'd
himſelf a little higher with fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

               <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> going about to mount,

hid in that Cavern, as I newly hinted,
appeared in the nick behind the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
put them into diſorder, kill'd a

               <p>That day <hi>Adilbar</hi> by computation

               <p>
                  <hi>Pelage</hi> Retreated forthwith, with all

               <p>After having well examin'd the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty

might find an entrance more eaſie to

               <p>THE joy King <hi>Aboulvalid</hi> had
for the victory he had gain'd over
his Brother <hi>Abraham,</hi> was quickly ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
by the news he receiv'd in a little

<hi>Mahomet Gilhair.</hi> He left no

wherefore he reſolv'd to ſend out of

for fear that if he deferr'd

as commonly does in ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
for ſo ſolemn an Embaſſy, he
choſe one of his favourites, call'd <hi>Abul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacim
Aben Marchan,</hi> who departed in
great haſte with all his Train, and was
very kindly receiv'd by all the Grandees
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:39314:115"/>
of that Court, and Lodg'd in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
Kings Palace.</p>
               <p>Having forthwith conven'd all the
Members of the Council of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and having let them peruſe the
Powers he had from <hi>Aboulvalid,</hi> in his
Name to take Poſſeſſion of that State;
they examin'd them, and having found
them in the form they ought to be,
King <hi>Aboulvalid</hi> was acknowledg'd and
declar'd King of that great Kingdom,
and <hi>Abulcacim Aben Marchan</hi> Vice-roy
in his abſence. But as in all times, and
all Countries, People there are Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with a deſire of Ruling; one of
the Principal Governours was there of
this; who flattering himſelf with the
thought that being <hi>Mahomet Gilhairs</hi>
near Relation, the Kingdom ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to appertain to him, than to his
Daughter, began under-hand to ſollicit
all the Leading men and Governours,
each in his turn, to aſſiſt him with his
Forces. He repreſented to them, That
being born in the Country, and with
them brought up, and the late Kings
neareſt Relation, the Crown belong'd
to him, rather than to a Foreigner;
and had the knack ſo to coaks them
with fine promiſes, that they at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:39314:116"/>
among themſelves for the moſt
part, to throw off <hi>Aboulvalid</hi>'s Yoak,
and to place him in his ſtead upon the
Throne. <hi>Hacan</hi> (ſo was this Captain
call'd) wanting not courage for ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an enterprize; having aſſembled
all the heads of his Party, entred by
main force into the Palace, where
<hi>Aben Marchan</hi> had his reſidence. This
Vice-King diſtruſted nothing; but as
ſoon as he had notice of ſo very trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
a deſign, having put himſelf
upon his defence with what happen'd
to be about him, he choſe rather to
dye in defending himſelf generouſly,
than to fall alive into the hands of the
Revolted. Thus though they only
really deſir'd to take him Priſoner, they
kill'd him, with all thoſe that were about
him, without ſo much as one eſcaping.</p>
               <p>The rumour of this riſing being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſpread, all thoſe of <hi>Hacan</hi>'s
Party proclaim'd him King, after the
wonted manner, taking withal an Oath
of Allegiance to him: And this new
King fail'd not at his acceſſion to the
Crown, to beſtow favours upon all his
Partizans, and to give, as all Uſurpers
do, all the orders neceſſary for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring

it took up towards the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> It was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
with very thick Clouds,
extraordinary Winds, and pernicious
Exhalations, and appear'd for forty
whole days together. This very much
affrighting the new King, he caus'd the
Mathematicians and Aſtrologers of the
Country to meet; who, after having
very exactly examin'd the Elevation
and Nature of this Comet, and the
ſign in which it riſe, ſaid that it threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Kingdom with great Wars, and
the Kings Perſon with an imminent
Death.</p>
               <p>While they were ſtill making their

thought that the end of the World

and was moſt ſtrange, was a Cloud
that coming from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> burſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>Theſe ſurprizing ſigns of Heavens

Wherefore having Landed at <hi>Thunis,</hi>

                  <hi>Hacan</hi> being fully inform'd of theſe

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:39314:120"/>
thus, though his Son ſhould not recover

ſmall, ſince he was only Born to dye:
On the contrary, he ſhould hold his
Death as well employ'd, becauſe he had

true, for he had kill'd with his own

break of day, and laſted till Noon,
when <hi>Hacan</hi>'s Men began to Buckle,
and were at length by dint of Sword
defeated. <hi>Hacan</hi> ſeeing the flight of
his Forces, ſought his ſafety in gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after them.</p>
               <p>The King being entred into <hi>Thunis,</hi>
did not think he had gain'd an abſolute
Victory, unleſs he had <hi>Hacan</hi> in his
hands: So as that he forthwith ſent
Foot and Horſe out on all ſides to ſeek
him, promiſing them great rewards if
they brought him to him. They
ſought him ſo well, that the Dogs of
a Flock of Sheep barking after him
in a Cave where he was hid, created
a deſire in them to go thither, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:39314:121"/>
occaſion'd his being taken. He was
immediately brought before <hi>Aboulvalid,</hi>
to whom having given a great deal of
ill language, as a deſperate man, that
ſaw there was no Remiſſion for him;
the King, that was otherwiſe very
mild, was ſo provok'd, that he caus'd
him to be impal'd alive, and left him in
that condition upon the Gate of the
Town, where he languiſh'd five whole
days; at the end of which he dy'd a
very cruel Death. All the Principal
Leaders of this Rebellion were then
Beheaded; and one of the General
Officers of the Army, call'd <hi>Abraham
Hacen,</hi> was choſen to be Vice-roy of
<hi>Thunis,</hi> in the room of <hi>Hacan</hi> the
Rebel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aboulvalid</hi> having ſettled his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

things again into their Primitive order,
ſet forth again with his Army towards

the firſt thing he did, was
to reward all the Principal men that
had ſerv'd him in that War, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<hi>Muca,</hi> whom he made of his
high Council, and one of the Principal
Miniſters of his State. After this,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:39314:121"/>
without ſtaying longer in his Palace
than was neceſſary to repoſe himſelf,
he thought of taking a Pilgrimage to

Are you willing to make Oath to him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly?</hi>
To which they anſwer'd aloud,
<hi>Yes, we are willing; Do then,</hi> reply'd
<hi>Algaſeli, as a token of the Allegiance you
promiſe to him, and of the Poſſeſſion he
from this preſent is going to take of the
Crown, all that the King and I am going

Son by the Hand, and ſeated him in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:39314:123"/>
his Throne; and the Prince having
taken the Right Hand of his Father,
kiſs'd it for a mark of his Obedience.
The Father on his ſide, for a token of
the Bleſſing<note n="*" place="margin">

an <hi>Alfaqui</hi> having brought the <hi>Alcoran,</hi>

<hi>for your King and Soveraign of

<hi>his Father?</hi> And all having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
<hi>Yes, we promiſe it: Let him then,</hi>
the <hi>Morabite</hi> reply'd, <hi>that ſhall not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
what he has now promis'd, be

And the <hi>Morabite</hi> having ſaid, with an
audible voice, That for the ſolemnity
of their Oath of Allegiance, all ſhould
do the ſame as the King and he did.
The King being got up, and having
kiſs'd the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> put it upon his Head,
the <hi>Morabite,</hi> and all the Chiefs and
Governours did the ſame afterwards,
each in their order. After which,
the <hi>Morabite</hi> being got up from his
Seat, and having addreſs'd his Speech
to Prince <hi>Jacob Almanzor; Your Celſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
ſaid he to him, <hi>do you not ſwear

you may cauſe them to live in Peace, and
not ſuffer any wrong to be done them.</hi> And
the Prince having ſaid, <hi>Yes,</hi> and that
he ſwore and promis'd it: <hi>Mind it well
then,</hi> reply'd <hi>Algaſeli, for if you do not
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:39314:124"/>
do it, the curſe of God will fall upon
you, as upon one perjur'd;</hi> to which
the Prince having anſwer'd, <hi>Amen:
Let your Celſitude then,</hi> continued
he, <hi>to ſhow you make an ſolemn
Oath, do as I do:</hi> In uttering theſe
words, he took the Book, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
kiſs'd, and put it on his Head,
he preſented it to the Prince, who
did the like.</p>
               <p>This Ceremony being finiſh'd,
all the Governours, and Leaders
of Troops, going out before the
Prince, ſet him on Horſeback, and
carry'd him around through the
City, in great Pomp, amid the
noiſe of a world of Inſtruments: And
all alighting at the great Moſch;
and having ſaid their Prayers there,
return'd with the ſame Pomp to
the Palace, where the King his
Father waited his coming, and where
the whole Cavalcade ended and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
               <p>This ſolemnity laſted three whole

Theſe three days that had been

caus'd the States to be held once

                     <hi>Aboulvalid</hi>'s Death, who leaves
to one of his Kinſmen, call'd
<hi>Mahomet Amcari,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of his State, during his
Sons Minority.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>ABoulvalid</hi> was much joy'd to ſee all
his great Kingdoms in Peace, and
all the Wars and Diſſentions he had
been oblig'd to undergo, abſolutely
ſtifled: But as the Wheel of Fortune
turns continually, and there is no
man upon Earth, that has a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
and an accompliſh'd happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
all Great, and all Mighty, as
he was, he try'd it like other men:
For he fell into ſo obſtinate and ſo
violent a Feaver, that whatever care
the greateſt and ableſt Phyſicians
in the World took, that were at
that time, they could not bring any
Remedy to it. Wherefore this Prince
ſeeing that all that was given him,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:39314:126"/>
did him more hurt than good, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
upon taking nothing at all:
And one day, in their preſence, and
in that of the Principal Perſons of
his Court, he ſaid, That he plainly
perceiv'd it to be the Will of God,
that he ſhould dye of that illneſs;
that thus he thank'd them for all
the pains they had thitherto ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and that he had no longer
any need of them. Then he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd
them, as well as all thoſe that
were about his Bed, and ſent for
<hi>Mahomet Algaſeli</hi> the <hi>Morabite,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with him upon all things, and
to provide the beſt he could for the
Government of the State, after his
Death; which was what put him
moſt in pain: For he plainly ſaw
his Son was as yet too Young, to
be able to contain ſo many Nations
in their Duty; and that it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
requiſite, to give the Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the State to ſome one, during
his Minority. He was much at a
loſs, how to determine on whom to
pitch; but he and <hi>Algaſeli</hi> at laſt
concluded, that there was not a
man of more Ability, nor in whom
more Confidence could be put, than
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:39314:126"/>
in <hi>Mahomet Amcari;</hi> his very near
Relation; inſomuch, that having had
him call'd to him, to tell him the
choice he had made of his Perſon;
and <hi>Amcari</hi> having made him a
thouſand Proteſtations of Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
and Fidelity, he nam'd him
in his laſt Will and Teſtament, the
Regent and Lieutenant-General of
the Empire, till that his Son <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi>
was at Age to Govern.</p>
               <p>He liv'd but a very few days
after having declar'd his Will in
this manner. And as he had go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
with much Lenity and Juſtice,
his Funeral, that was perform'd
with great ſtate, was accompany'd
with a real Mourning by all the
People, and with ſuch tears as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from a down-right Affliction.
<hi>Mahomet Amcari</hi> having immediately
taken upon him the management
of Affairs, the Queen Mother re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to live retired, as being well
becoming a Widow; and that ſhe
might have the more care of her
Son, and keep him in the greater
ſecurity, withdrew to a Country
Houſe, whither the <hi>Caliph Almanzor,</hi>
her Father-in-law, formerly retired;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:39314:127"/>
and where there was all ſorts of
Conveniences.</p>
               <p>Wherefore being gone thither to
ſhut her ſelf up with all her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and that of the King her Son;
<hi>Amcari</hi> ſeeing himſelf abſolute Maſter
of the State, and obey'd by all the
Governours of all the Realms that
compoſe this great Empire, began to
be ſenſible of the movements of
Ambition, and the deſire of Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that glides by little and little,
like an Earth-worm, into the Hearts
of all men; who from the nothing,
wherein they were, ſee themſelves
rais'd up to Authority: For after
having began to prick him on by
little bites, they came at length to
gnaw him all over.</p>
               <p>Having his mind poſſeſs'd with
this thought, and only thinking of
the means to bring it about, he
thought it expedient to begin with
gaining over the Principal men of
the Council and Army, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Towns and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;
as thoſe that had all the
Forces of the State in their hands.
Wherefore he let not any occaſion
ſlip, of making them Preſents, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:39314:127"/>
of obliging them. When any of
them dy'd, he only put in their
place ſuch people as of whom he
was well aſſured<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mutben,</hi> ready to ſerve him</note>, and whom he
thought would not fail him on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion;
and did this with ſo much
diſſimulation, that as he ſpoke to
no body of his deſign, nor did any
body perceive it. At length, having
diſpos'd all things to his fancy; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reduc'd them to the point he
judg'd proper for the Executing of
his Treaſon, he would needs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
his mind to one of his
principal friends, whom he had
made head of the Council of War,
call'd <hi>Aben Culeyman;</hi> who told
him frankly, That ſince he ask'd
him his advice, he found great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
in undertaking a thing
of that nature, as long as the Prince
<hi>Jacob Almanzor</hi> his Maſter was alive:
For as he was beloved by all his
Fathers Creatures, there would be
doubtleſs, many Governours that
would declare for him; that this
enterprize would ſeem very ſtrange
to the <hi>Arabians;</hi> and that it would
meet with great difficulties in the
Provinces; where, in imitation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:39314:128"/>
there would not be a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
but would make himſelf King,
in the extent of his Government:
That thus, whereas all he intended
to do, was only to augment his
Authority, and be abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant,
he would find himſelf
abyſs'd, in the ſtormy Sea of Wars,
which ſuch an<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sutar,</hi> Rebellion.</note> over-turning would
occaſion; and that after he had
thus Rioted the people, it would
be no longer in his power to calm
them: Theſe reaſons ſeem'd very
pertinent to <hi>Mahomet Amcari;</hi> and
as he had ever ſped in following the
other Councils given him by <hi>Aben
Culeyman,</hi> he plainly ſaw, that this
he then gave him, departed from a
man conſummated in the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of State Affairs: Wherefore he
bethought himſelf of an indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
expedient, which was to rid
himſelf of Prince <hi>Almanzor.</hi> He was
reſolv'd not to communicate this
thought to any other than the ſame
<hi>Aben Culeyman;</hi> but that Wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
ſtill endeavoured to divert
him gently, and by the beſt reaſons
he could bethink himſelf of, from
ſo wicked a deſign; being in no
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:39314:128"/>
wiſe able to approve of ſo horrible
a cruelty, and ſo baſe and black an
action. Nevertheleſs perceiving he
could not root this intention out of
his mind, he was furiouſly vex'd;
and having at laſt reſolv'd upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
a fitting remedy, he thought
it to be time to diſcover the ſecret
of this Treaſon, to the Captain-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
as to his beſt friend, and to
the Prince his Maſters moſt Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Servant. <hi>Muca</hi> being much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at ſuch an infidelity, having
confirm'd his friend in the deſign
he already had, of preventing ſo
great a miſchief; after having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
together what they had to do,
and promis'd one another the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſecreſie, they reſolv'd that <hi>Aben
Culeyman</hi> ſhould continue to put the
Regent upon this matter, of which
he made him the confident; and
that he ſhould endeavour to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by what byaſs he pretended to
bring about his deſign, that ſo they
might by the ſame means break all
his meaſures.</p>
               <p>This being their reſult, <hi>Aben Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyman</hi>
happening to be with <hi>Amcari</hi>
alone, did not fail to put him upon
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:39314:129"/>
that Chapter; and the Regent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
told him, That finding the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
he had urg'd rational to all
intents, he was reſolv'd to overcome
them, by cauſing the Prince to be
Poyſon'd; after which all things
would be eaſie to him: <hi>Aben Culey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
having to this made him anſwer,
That he was in the right; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
much ado to entertain the
vexation he had on this account, he
left him as ſoon as he could, and
went in all haſt to inform <hi>Muca.</hi>
Theſe two Truſty Servants, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the blackneſs of the Regents
action, and of what a conſequence
it was to think of ſaving the Prince
their Maſter, from the peril that
was preparing againſt him, found
there to be leſs evil in berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Traytor <hi>Mahomet Amcari</hi>
of his life, and fail him in that
occaſion, that to keep his ſecret,
to be Traytors to their Lawful King:
Wherefore they both reſolv'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that they might make
the leſs noiſe and diſorder, to
invite him one day to Dinner, and
to ſeize on his Perſon while at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
But in the mean while, for fear
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:39314:129"/>
the Prince ſhould fall into the Trap
that was laid for him, while they
were taking their meaſures for ſo
hardy a deſign, they thought it
convenient to inform the Queen
of all that paſs'd, that ſo ſhe might
be upon her Guard, againſt the
Treaſon that was preparing againſt
the Prince her Son. Whereupon
<hi>Muca</hi> went to her with all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
in that retir'd Houſe I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd;
and having acquainted her
with the Regents Perfidy, ſhe was
much afflicted; but ſhe receiv'd
comfort at the ſame, in having
found ſuch Loyal Perſons as would
diſcover it to her. <hi>Muca</hi> having
intreated the Queen, to keep the
matter very ſecret, as it highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
her to do, both for her
Sons ſake, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
and having aſſur'd him, ſhe
might make account of him, and
that he was reſolv'd to dye for her
Service; he return'd in all haſt to

                  <hi>MAhomet Amcari,</hi> ſtill contriving
to work the Princes Death,
and ſeeking for that purpoſe, the

a very rich<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Goyhrim,</hi> a Poyſon'd Robe.</note> Garment to be made,
to make him a Preſent of, as is
cuſtomary at certain times: And
after having caus'd it to be well
prepar'd, with a very ſubtile Poyſon,
ſent it to the Prince, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
other very gallant, and very
curious Preſents.</p>
               <p>All thoſe of the Queens Palace,
ſeeing theſe Preſents unfolded, were
immediately tranſported with the
beauty of that Veſtment; all ſaying,
That the Prince could not put on
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:39314:130"/>
a finer: But the Queen being afraid
of its being poyſon'd, would by no
means ſuffer him to wear it that
day, no not ſo much as try it:
And the Night being come, to ſee
if ſhe had any reaſon to harbour
ſuch apprehenſions, ſhe had it put
upon a great Greyhound, that was
found dead on the morrow, his
Skin all cover'd with Sores.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s malice and deſign being
then paſt all doubt, this generous
Princeſs being very Prudent, and
having a Courage above her Sex;
without making any noiſe of the
thing ſhe had diſcover'd, or of the
reſolution ſhe had taken in her
mind to puniſh ſuch an attempt,
ſent to tell <hi>Mahomet Amcari</hi> the
Regent, That the Prince would be
very glad to ſee him, and ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
to diſcourſe upon ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of conſequence. And knowing
him to be upon the way thither,
ſhe caus'd all her Guards to keep
the entrance of the Gate, as if it
were to do him honour; but with
order, That none of his ſhould be
admitted in with him. As ſoon
as he was entred, they ſeiz'd on
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:39314:131"/>
his Perſon, and brought him into
the Queens preſence; who having
reproach'd him with his perfidy,
and told him how ſhe knew all his
Treacherous deſign, ſhe had an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
call'd in, whom ſhe had
at hand on purpoſe for his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and had his Throat cut into
the Baſon of a Fountain that was
in the Caſtle: Then having caus'd
his Body to be laid upon an Aſs,
had it carry'd to <hi>Carbal,</hi> and ſo
through all the Streets of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
follow'd by the publick Criers,
who by ſound of Trumpet, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
he was in that condition,
for having deſign'd to Poyſon his
King, and ſeize on the Crown;
and after having left it in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
place, ſhe caus'd his Head to
be ſet upon the Gate of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>She did not long defer coming
to <hi>Carbal,</hi> with the Prince her Son;
and entring the Palace, ſhe ſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
for the two Faithful
Servants, who had revealed to her
this moſt Trayterous deſign; and
told them, That the obligation
ſhe lay under, for the Service they
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:39314:131"/>
had both newly done her, was ſo
great, that ſhe knew not how to
expreſs the acknowledgement ſhe
had of it; that the only reward
proportionate to it, was the Regency
of the State; that ſhe had had
a deſign to give it to the one and
to the other: but that as this great
Authority which they both equally
deſerv'd, could not be divided, and
that ſhe was afraid of offending
one of the two, if ſhe gave it to
the other, ſhe was reſolv'd to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the beſt ſhe could her ſelf,
without giving any one that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
but that ſhe would ever manage
all things by their Councils, and
that they ſhould ever be the firſt of
the State after her. They were
both very well ſatisfy'd with this
reſolution; and News being come
of a Party that was framing in
the <hi>Weſt,</hi> ſhe ſent them both, as
thoſe in whom ſhe had moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence;
namely, <hi>Aben Culeyman</hi>
into the Kingdom of <hi>Thunis,</hi> and
<hi>Muca</hi> into that of <hi>Morocco,</hi> with an
abſolute Authority, there to contain
the People in their Duty. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they both departed from <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:39314:132"/>
cover'd with Honour and
Teſtimonies of Eſteem and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

gave them, and took their way

               <argument>
                  <p>Prince <hi>Almanzor</hi>'s Death; the
Queen his Mother dyes of
Grief, in a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and <hi>Ali Abilhachek</hi>
cauſes himſelf to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed

               </argument>
               <p>QUeen <hi>Omhalair</hi> made it the whole
ſtudy and application of her
mind, to bring up well her
Son, the Prince <hi>Jacob Almanzor,</hi>
whom ſhe had ever in her Eye.
One day when that ſhe was gone
to Dine with him, in a Garden out
of the Town, the Prince after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
threw himſelf upon a Bed, in a
Room where he fell a ſleep; and
a Spider having prick'd him in the
Right Eye, his Face ſwell'd in ſuch
a manner, and put him to ſuch great
Pain, and occaſion'd ſuch dangerous
Fits, as that he liv'd but ſeven days.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:39314:133"/>
The Queen laid his Death ſo to
heart, that not being capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
any Conſolation, or of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
a Son, for whom ſhe had
ſo tender an affection; ſhe fell into
ſo great a Languiſhment, that all
the Remedies of the Phyſicians in
no wiſe eaſing her Malady, ſhe
dy'd fifteen days after him.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Deaths, ſo ſudden and
ſo cloſe upon one another, occaſion'd
a mighty amazement in the Court,
that was for ſome time in ſuch a
ſurprize, that their whole diſcourſe
was upon ſo extraordinary a thing.
But at length, coming to think that
there was none left of the Race of
the <hi>Almanzors,</hi> to whom the Crown
appertain'd by Succeſſion; the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and the
Governours of the Provinces, began
to make their Cabals. One of them,
call'd <hi>Ali Abilhacheck,</hi> chancing to
have more Friends than the reſt,
caus'd himſelf himſelf to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
<hi>Caliph;</hi> and after having
caus'd an Oath of Allegiance to be
taken to him, and had his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſolemniz'd with great Pomp,
with the Solemnity, and the Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:39314:133"/>
that are wont to be practic'd
in ſuch like occaſions; he began
with rewarding thoſe that rais'd him
to the place he held, giving them Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
and Employs; inſomuch,
that there was no body but on whom
he conferr'd ſome ſavour: Beſides this,
he apply'd himſelf in good earneſt to
make regulations upon all abuſes that
were introduc'd into the Government,
and to do Juſtice to all thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
it of him, without making them
wait; inſomuch that he acquir'd in a
ſhort time not only a great Reputation,
but alſo the friendſhip of all the people;
they eſteem'd themſelves very happy
in being govern'd by ſo good a King.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the Line of the <hi>Aboul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid
Almanzors.</hi>
