            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>NOW to come to my point. This Discourse is not a <hi>Wild</hi> and <hi>Rambling Narrative</hi> of some <hi>Indefinite Plot,</hi> that no body knows <hi>what</hi> to <hi>make</hi> of, or <hi>where</hi> to <hi>find</hi> it: But it is a <hi>Narrative</hi> (by way of <hi>Excellence</hi>) of <hi>THE Plot</hi>: that is to say, the <hi>Capitall</hi> and <hi>Hellish Plot</hi> which is <hi>now</hi> in <hi>Agitation,</hi> for the Destruction of Our <hi>Prince, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> to the Horrour and Amazement of all the <hi>Reformed Catholiques</hi> in <hi>Christendom.</hi> I call them <hi>Reformed Catholiques,</hi> rather then <hi>Protestants,</hi> because I take the <hi>Catholique</hi> to be the <hi>Antienter Family</hi> of the <hi>Two</hi>: The <hi>Denomination</hi> being used in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi>; and not only to denote a <hi>Generality,</hi> or <hi>Universality</hi> of <hi>Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>: but also to <hi>Distinguish Orthodox,</hi> and <hi>Obedient Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> from <hi>Schismatiques,</hi> and <hi>Heretiques.</hi> 'Tis cast in my Dish I know, as a <hi>Reproach,</hi> that I will not own my self to be a <hi>Protestant.</hi> Now so far as <hi>Protestant</hi> is a <hi>Catholique,</hi> or as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>That</hi> which <hi>They</hi> call <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,</hi> 'tis all one to me, whether I passe for a <hi>Reformed Catholique,</hi> a <hi>Church of England-man,</hi> or a <hi>Protestant.</hi> But when <hi>Heresie,</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi> comes to shelter it self under the Cover of <hi>Protestantism,</hi> (which is but too common a Case) I have no Ambition to be accounted any of <hi>those Protestants.</hi> So that my Crime is only that I am <hi>a Church-of-England-Protestant.</hi> But to return to my Theme.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95866:3"/>LET the Reader take notice, that as these Papers are only a <hi>Narrative</hi> of <hi>that Plot</hi> which is notoriously known, and distinguished from <hi>all other Plots,</hi> by the <hi>Emphasis</hi> of <hi>THE Plot</hi>: So it is <hi>L'Estrange's Narrative</hi> of <hi>That Plot</hi>; from whom no more Light can reasonably be expected then what arises out of matters within the Compasse of His Observation. He does not pretend, either directly, or indirectly, to have been <hi>Entrusted</hi> by any of the <hi>Priests,</hi> or <hi>Jesuits</hi>; Or to have been <hi>present</hi> at any of their Bloody and Desperate <hi>Consults</hi>; or <hi>Privy</hi> to any of their <hi>Letters, Messages,</hi> or <hi>Commissions:</hi> So that <hi>We</hi> can say <hi>nothing at all</hi> to the <hi>Particulars</hi> that have been given in by the <hi>Kings Witnesses</hi>: Or if we <hi>Could,</hi> the doing of it would signify no more then the holding of a <hi>Candle</hi> to the <hi>Sun</hi>: For whoever carefully <hi>peruses Their Writings</hi> and <hi>Depositions, compares</hi> their <hi>Testimonies</hi>; and <hi>yet doubts</hi> of the <hi>Plot,</hi> is litt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>THE <hi>Difference</hi> betwixt a <hi>Plot,</hi> and an <hi>Intrigue,</hi> I take to be <hi>This</hi>; a <hi>Plot</hi> may be <hi>Solitary,</hi> as when a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives or casts about with himself how to get a <hi>Dinner,</hi> (for the purpose) an <hi>Office,</hi> a <hi>Pension,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>THE most Formidable Story of All, is the <hi>Conspiracy</hi> of the <hi>Prentices:</hi> and there was such Work made with <hi>Capt.

These Blades, finding that the Petition had given Offence, propounded the doing something on the Other Side too, that might shew they were neither <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiques,</hi> nor <hi>Papists</hi>; and so they gave publique Notice in <hi>Thompsons Intelligence</hi> of <hi>their</hi> Intentions upon the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversary</hi> of his Majestys <hi>Restauration</hi> to burn the <hi>Rump.</hi> The First time perhaps that ever a Conspiracy against

            <p>ON the 6th of <hi>April</hi> last, about 7. in the Morning, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Ovington</hi> and <hi>Mr. Thomas King</hi> were taken out of their Beds and Charged with <hi>High Treason</hi>; their Boxes and Papers Rifled, and Themselves Examin'd apart; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Ill appeared against them.

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:95866:13"/>
in great Admiration, askt what this mighty businesse might be: but he went back to the <hi>Major,</hi> without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Reply: and after a little while return'd to <hi>Mr. King.</hi> Major Ovington (Says he) <hi>has dealt Generously with me, and he shall fare the better for't; for I do not desire the Destruction of any man:</hi> But still professing more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to <hi>Mr. King,</hi> for his Fathers Sake, and looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Him as a Person only drawn in. So he prest <hi>Mr. King</hi> to a Confession, and told him, if he would but Subscribe Such a Paper as he would draw up, and knew to be True, he would not Commit him, and it should be the better for him. <hi>Mr. King</hi> askt him what he would be at, and told him that if the <hi>Major</hi> had charg'd him with any Ill thing toward the <hi>King,</hi> or the <hi>Government,</hi> he was an Unworthy man. Whereupon he went his way, and Committed the <hi>Major</hi> to the <hi>Gate-house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Magistrate</hi> having left Mr. <hi>King</hi> at his own House, came back to him immediatly, and told him, <hi>'tis well</hi> Mr. <hi>King</hi> (says he) <hi>that you are faln into my hands; for if I please, there's but a step betwixt You and Death; I am loth to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you, because I know it will be your Ruine; every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made out so clear against you</hi>; Mr. <hi>King</hi> still urging to know what all This meant, the <hi>Magistrate</hi> went to the further end of the room, and fell to writing; Mr. <hi>King,</hi> being desirous to see what he wrote; He held the Paper in his hand and ask'd him if he did not know of a Design to Seize the <hi>Tower,</hi> and rescue the <hi>Lords</hi>; and severall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lewd Things. To which Mr. <hi>King</hi> reply'd, that it was all <hi>Villany.</hi> The <hi>Magistrate</hi> gave Mr. <hi>King</hi> a Bottle of <hi>Syder,</hi> and Treated him with an Appearance of much kindnesse. After a while, he took Mr. <hi>King</hi> in his Arms; telling him he saw he was resolv'd upon his Own Ruine. Mr. <hi>King</hi> desir'd that he might apply himself to the <hi>Secretaries of State</hi> to be <hi>Examined</hi> by <hi>Them</hi>; which the Magistrate took Ill, pretending that his Majesty had left the bus'nesse to Him.

prevail upon Mr. <hi>King</hi> to swear against <hi>Major Ovington</hi>; but not succeeding, he threaten'd to lay him in Irons; and so Committed him to the <hi>Gate-house,</hi> with Order to the Keeper, that the Gentlemen should not come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor receive any Message, without having taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Examination upon Oath, before his Commitment; neither after it, was there one word of Treason Sworn against him.

            <q>WHEREAS Oath hath been made before Me, that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I herewith send in Custody to you <hi>(Mr. Thomas King)</hi> hath Treasonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived a Rebellion, and falsly Designed the accusing severall of His Majesties Loyal Peers and Subjects of the said Treason.

            </p>
            <p>THIS I hope will not be deny'd to have been a <hi>Sham-Plot</hi>; and promoted by a <hi>Faction</hi> too: For it was the work of Twenty Libells to defend the Proceeding: The Persons <hi>accused</hi> are Gentlemen of approved <hi>Loyalty,</hi> Fair and Honourable <hi>Conversation,</hi> and men zealously affected to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> There was an attempt made by the same Magistrate at the same time upon another Gentleman in the same House, (a <hi>Cavalier</hi> of unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi>) and upon a like pretence too; But That <hi>Trepan</hi> was let fall again.</p>
            <p>HERE'S the Fruit of taking up <hi>Plots</hi> upon <hi>Trust</hi>; and running Headlong from the <hi>Fear,</hi> nay, from the very <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> into the <hi>Thing it self.</hi> Let any man shew me a more <hi>Imperious Tyranny,</hi> if he can, or a more <hi>Implicite Faith</hi>; then for men to be worse then <hi>Spirited</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thus, <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>without Remedy</hi>; and and run down for <hi>Criminals</hi> by a <hi>Popular Consent,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out understanding one Syllable of the matter in <hi>question.</hi> These <hi>Practices</hi> and <hi>Excesses</hi> are the Subject of my <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>; and so far from misrepresenting the <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> that there is not any sort of Correspondence, in This Case, betwixt the <hi>One,</hi> and the <hi>Other.</hi> And I defy any man to shew, whereever I let fall so much as One word of the <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> but with a modest and due Respect to the Government.

of the <hi>Other.</hi> And it is Time certainly for every man to look about him, when our <hi>Lives, Liberties,</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi> lye all at <hi>mercy</hi>; and every Honest man expos'd to the Animosities of <hi>Faction,</hi> and <hi>Revenge:</hi> For we are not judg'd by what we <hi>are</hi> in Our <hi>Selves,</hi> in Our <hi>Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi>; but by what we are <hi>said</hi> to be.

If men shall be hurry'd into <hi>Jayls</hi> without <hi>Evidence,</hi> because they will not Subscribe either <hi>Confessions,</hi> or <hi>Accusations,</hi> touching matters which they know nothing of, and <hi>Witnesses</hi> Tamper'd afterward by <hi>Menaces,</hi> for <hi>Proofs ex post Facto,</hi> to colour such <hi>Illegal Commitments?</hi> We have had but too much of This allready; and no body knows whose Turn it may be next: Since what was the Case of these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, may be any mans.</p>
            <p>DOES it not behove us, now, to distinguish betwixt <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Clamour</hi>; betwixt <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Calumny,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Acts of <hi>Authority,</hi> and the License of <hi>Tumults</hi>; betwixt the <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Temperate Deliberations</hi> and <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> and the <hi>violent Heats</hi> and <hi>Partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes</hi> of the <hi>Common-people?</hi> How come the <hi>Multitude</hi> to be <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>Plots,</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> more than of <hi>Other Crimes</hi> and <hi>Misdemeanours</hi>? For That's the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of the <hi>Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> where every man is to be made a <hi>Traytor,</hi> or a <hi>Papist,</hi> as They think meet.

            <p>It is a great poynt gain'd, where a <hi>Faction</hi> has got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so much the Command of the <hi>People,</hi> as to make them <hi>believe</hi> every thing that They <hi>Say,</hi> and <hi>approve</hi> of every thing that they <hi>do.</hi> There is a <hi>Plot</hi> no doubt on't; but <hi>That Plot</hi> does not yet create <hi>Another Plot,</hi> where there is <hi>no Plot at all.</hi> The <hi>Popish Plot</hi> has <hi>Bounds,</hi> and <hi>Limits</hi>; the <hi>Kings Wittnesses</hi> tell us <hi>what</hi> it <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>where</hi>
