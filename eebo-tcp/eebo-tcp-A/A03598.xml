            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I owe you, hath made mee ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to shewe the world these
godly Sermons vnder your
name. In which as every point is
worth observation, so some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
are to bee noted. The
first, that as the spirit of Prophecie is from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
who doth inwardly heate, and enlighten the
hearts &amp; minds of his holy Pen-men, (which if some
would diligently consider, they would not puzzle
themselues with the contentions of <hi>Scot,</hi> &amp; <hi>Thomas,
Whether God only, or his ministring spirits doe infuse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mens minds propheticall revelations, per species intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibiles</hi>)
so God framed their words also. Whence the
holy Father<note n="a" place="margin">Lib 4 ca 6. de doct. Chr.</note> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> religiously obserueth, that
al those, which vnderstand the sacred writers, wil also
<pb facs="tcp:4395:3"/>
perceaue, that they ought not to vse other wordes,
then they did, in expressing those heavenly mysteries
which their hearts <hi>conceaved,</hi> as the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi>
did our Saviour, <hi>By the holy Ghost.</hi> The greater is <hi>Castel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi>
his offence, who hath laboured to teach the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
to speake otherwise, then they haue already.
Much like to that impious King of Spaine, <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
X, who found fault with Gods workes,<note n="b" place="margin">Rob. Tolet. l. 4 cap 5.</note>

            <p>You shall moreover from hence vnderstand, how
Christianitic consists not in formall, and seeming <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi>
(vnder which who knowes not notorious villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
to maske?) but in the heart root. Whence the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
truly teacheth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Mockers,</hi> which vse religion
as a cloake to put off, and on, as the weather serveth,
are worse then Pagans and Infidels. Where I cannot
omit to shew, how iustly this kind of men hath beene
reproved by that renowned Martyr of Iesus Christ,
B. <hi>Latimer;</hi> both because it will bee apposite to this
purpose, and also free that Christian <hi>worthy</hi> from the
slaunderous reproaches of<note n="*" place="margin">Parsons in 3. Convers.</note> him, who was, if ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
a <hi>Mocker</hi> of God, Religion, and all good men. But
<pb facs="tcp:4395:3"/>
first I must desire you, and in you all Readers, not to
thinke lightly of that excellent man for vsing of this,
and the like wittie similitudes in his Sermons. For
whosoever will call to minde, with what <hi>riff-raff</hi>
Gods people were fedde in those daies, when their
Priests,<note n="e" place="margin">Malac. 2 7.</note> 
               <hi>whose lips should haue preserued knowledge,</hi>
preached nothing else but dreames, and false miracles
of counterfeit saints, enrolled in that<note n="f" place="margin">Canus locor. lib. 11. c. 6 Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves lib. 2 de cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rupt. art. Hard. lib 4. Detect.</note> sottish <hi>Legend,</hi>
coined &amp; amplified by a drowsie head betweene slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and waking. He that will consider this, and also
how the people were delighted with such toies (God
sending them strong delusions, that they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
lies) and how hard it would haue beene for any
man wholly and vpon the suddaine to drawe their
minds to another bent; wil easily perceaue, both how
necessary it was to vse symbolicall discourse, and how
wisely, and moderately it was applied by that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Father, to the end he might lead their vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
so farre, till it were so convinced, informed, and
setled, that it might forget the meanes and way, by
which it was led, and thinke only of that it had acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
For in all such mysticall speeches, who knows not
that the end, for which they are vsed, is onely to bee
thought vpon?</p>
            <p>This then being first considered, let vs heare the
story, as it is related by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Fox: M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Latimer,</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Pag. 1903. edit. 1570.</note> saith
he, <hi>in his sermon gaue the people certaine cardes out of the
fift, sixt, and seaventh Chap: of S. Matthew. For the chiefe
Triumph in the cards, he limited the Hart, as the principal
thing that they should serue God withall, whereby he quite
<pb facs="tcp:4395:4"/>
overthrew all hypocriticall and externall ceremonies, not
tending to the necessarie furtherance of Gods holy word &amp;
Sacraments.</hi> By this <hi>he exhorted all men to serue the Lord
with inward heart and true affection, &amp; not with outward
ceremonies, adding moreouer to the praise of that triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ph,
that though it were never so smal, yet it would take vp the
best coat card beside in the bunch, yea though it were the
king of Clubbes, &amp;c. meaning thereby how the Lord would
be worshipped and served in simplicitie of the heart, and
verity, wherein consisteth true Christian religion, &amp;c.</hi>
Thus M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fox.</hi> By which it appeares, that the holy
mans intention was to lift vp the peoples hearts to
God, &amp; not that he made a <hi>sermon of playing at cards,
and taught them how to play at Triumph, &amp; plaied</hi> (him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe)
<hi>at cards in the Pulpit,</hi> as that base companion
<note n="h" place="margin">In the third part of 3. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions of Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land: in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine of Foxes Sainte, cap. 14. §. 53. 54 p. 215</note> 
               <hi>Parsons</hi> reports the matter in his wonted scurrilous
vaine of rayling, whence hee calleth it a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Sect 55</note> 
               <hi>Christmasse
Sermon.</hi> Now he that will thinke ill of such allusions,
may out of the abundance of his follie iest at <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes</hi>
for his story of the<note n="k" place="margin">Plut in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthen.</note> sheepe, wolues, &amp; dogs,
and at<note n="l" place="margin">Liv. dec 1. lib. 2. an. V. C 60</note> 
               <hi>Menenius</hi> for his fiction of the Belly. But, <hi>hinc
illae lacrymae,</hi> The good Bishop meant that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Religion came not from the <hi>heart,</hi> but consisted
in outward ceremonies: which sorely greived <hi>Parsons</hi>
who never had the least warmth or sparke of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.
Whether B. <hi>Latimer</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared the Bishops to the
<hi>knaues</hi> of <hi>Clubs,</hi> as the fellow interprets him, I knowe
not: I am sure <hi>Parsons</hi> of all others deserved those co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and so I leaue him.</p>
            <p>We see then, what <hi>inward puritie</hi> is required of all
<pb facs="tcp:4395:4"/>
Christians, which if they haue, then in <hi>prayer,</hi> and all
other Christian duties, they shall lift vp <hi>pure hands,</hi> as
the<note n="m" place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 8.</note> Apostle speakes, not as<note n="n" place="margin">Annal to 1 Ann. 57. n. 109 110 &amp; .10. 2. An. 132. num. 5</note>

free from the pollution of sin, as the greeke word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>You may also see here refuted those calumnies of
the Papists, that we abandon al religious rites, &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
duties, as also the confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our doctrine tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

with the ende wherefore,
this Epistle was written, is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the front &amp; entrie of the
same. There were then, as there
are now, many evill and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
disposed persons, not of
the mysticall body, yet within the visible bounds of
the Church, men which were of old ordained to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
vngodly men which turned the grace of
our God into wantonnesse and denied the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.
For this cause the spirit of the Lord is in the hand
of Iude, the servant of Iesus, and brother of Iames, to
exhort them that are called, and sanctified of God the
father, that they would earnestly contend to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4395:6"/>
the faith; which was once delivered vnto the
Saints. Which faith because wee cannot maintaine
except wee knowe perfectly, first against whom, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
in what sort it must be maintained; therefore
in the former three verses of that parcell of Scripture
which I haue read, the enimies of the crosse of Christ
are plainely described; and in the later two, they that
loue the Lord Iesus haue a sweet lesson giuen them
how to strengthen &amp; stablish themselues in the faith.
Let vs first therefore examin the description of these
reprobates concerning faith; and afterwards come
to the words of the exhortation; wherein Christians
are taught how to rest their hearts on Gods eternall
and everlasting truth. The description of these god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
persons is two fold; <hi>Generall</hi> and <hi>Speciall.</hi> The <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi>
doth point them out and shew what manner
of men they should be. The <hi>particular</hi> pointeth at
them, and saith plainely these are they. In the <hi>generall</hi>
description we haue to consider of these things. <hi>First,
when</hi> they were described, <hi>they were told of before. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
the men by whom they were described, <hi>They
were spoken of by the Apostles of our Lord Iesus Christ.
Thirdly,</hi> the daies when they should bee manifested
vnto the world, they told you they <hi>should bee in the
last time. Fourthly,</hi> their disposition and whole demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,
<hi>mockers and walkers after their own vngodly lusts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>In the third to the Philippians, the Apostle
describeth certaine.</hi> They are men, <hi>saith hee</hi> of whom I
haue told you often, and now with teares I tell you of them,
their God is their belly, their glorying and reioycing is in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4395:6"/>
their owne shame, they mind earthly things.</p>
            <p>These were enimies of the crosse of Christ, eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
whom he saw, &amp; his eies gusht out with teares
to behold them. But we are taught in this place, how
the Apostles spake also of enimies, whom as yet they
had not seen, described a family of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as yet vnheard
of, a generation reserved for the end of the world, &amp;
for the last time, they had not onely declared what
they heard and saw in the daies wherein they lived,
but they haue prophecid also of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in time to come.
And <hi>you doe well,</hi> saith S. Peter, <hi>in that yee take heed, to
the words of prophecie, so that yee first know this, that no
prophecie in the Scripture commeth of any mans owne
resolution.</hi> No prophecie in Scripture commeth of
any mans owne resolution. For all prophecy, which
is in Scripture, came by the secret inspiration of God.
But there are prophecies which are no scripture, yea
there are prophecies against the Scripture: my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
beware of such prophecies, and take heed you
heed them not. Remember the things that were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of before;<note place="margin">Of the spirit of prophecie receaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God himself.</note> but spoken of before by the Apostles
of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ. Take heed to
prophecies, but to prophecies which are in scripture.
For both the manner and the matter of those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
doth shew plainely that they are of God.</p>
            <p>3 Touching the manner, how men by the spirit
of prophecie in holy Scripture haue spoken &amp; writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of things to come, wee must vnderstand that as
the knowledge of that they spake, so likewise the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
of that they knewe came not by these vsuall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4395:7"/>
and ordinary meanes whereby we are brought to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the mysteries of our salvation, and are wont
to instruct others in the same. For whatsoever wee
know, we haue it by the hands and ministrie of men,
which lead vs along like children from a letter to a
syllable, from a syllable to a word, from a word to a
line, from a line to a sentence, from a sentence to a
side, and so turne over. But God himselfe was their
instructour, he himselfe taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> partly by dreames
and visions in the night, partly by revelations in the
daie, taking them aside from amongst their brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
and talking with them, as a man would talke with his
neighbour in the way. Thus they became acquainted
even with the secret and hidden counsels of God.
They saw things which themselues were not able to
vtter, they beheld that whereat men and Angels are
astonished. They vnderstood in the beginning, what
should come to passe in the last daies.</p>
            <p>4 God, which lightned thus the eies of their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
giving them knowledge by vnvsuall and
extraordinarie meanes,<note place="margin">Of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of speech.</note> did also miraculously himself
frame and fashion their wordes and writings, in so
much that a greater difference there seemeth not to
bee betweene the manner of their knowledge, then
there is between the manner of their speed &amp; ours.
When we haue conceiued a thing in our hearts and
throughlie vnderstand it, as wee thinke within our
selues, yet we can vtter it in such sort that our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
may receaue instruction or comfort at our mouths,
how great, how long, how earnest meditation are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4395:7"/>
we forced to vse? And after much travaile, and much
paines, when we open our lips to speake of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
workes of God, our tongues doe faulter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our mouthes, yea many times wee disgrace the
dreadfull mysteries of our faith, and grieue the spirit
of our hearers by words vnsavory,<note place="margin">Iob. 15. 2. 3.</note> and vnseemely
speeches. <hi>Shall a wise man fill his bellie with the easterne
vind,</hi> saith <hi>Eliphaz, shall a wise man dispute with words
not comely? or with talke that is not profitable?</hi> Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
even they that are wisest amongst vs living, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the Prophets, seem no otherwise to talke
of God, then as if the children which are caried in
armes should speake of the greatest matters of state.
They whose words doe most shew forth their wise
and standing, and whose lips doe vtter the purest
knowledge, so long as they vnderstand and speake as
men, are they not faine sundry waies to excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Sometimes acknowledging with the wise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<hi>hardly can we discerne the things that are on earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wisd. 9. 16.</note> 
               <hi>and
with great labour finde wee out the things that are before
vs, who can then seeke out the things that are in heauen?</hi>
Sometimes confessing with <hi>Iob</hi> the righteous, intrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting
of things too wonderfull for vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we wist not what. Sometimes ending their talke, as
doth the history of the Macchabees, if we haue done,
wel, &amp; aa the cause required it is that we desire if we
haue spok<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stenderly and havely we haue done that
we could. But God <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <note place="margin">Esai. 49. 2.</note>
saith, <hi>Esay</hi> And <hi>we haue receiued,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>not
the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4395:8"/>
wee might know the things, which are given to vs of God,
which things also we speake, not in words, which mans wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
teacheth, but which the holy Ghost doth teach.</hi> This is
that which the Prophets mean by those books writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ful within, &amp; without, which books were so often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eat, not because God fed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with inke,
&amp; paper, but to teach vs, that so oft as he employed
them in this heavenly worke, they neither spake, nor
wrote any word of their owne, but vttered sillable by
sillable as the spirit put it into their months, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then the Harp or the Lute doth giue a sound ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the discretion of his hands that holdeth &amp;
striketh it with skill. The difference is only this. An
instrument whether it be a pipe or harpe maketh a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
in the times and sounds, which distinction is
well perceived of the hearer, the instrument it selfe
vnderstanding not what is piped or harped. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and holy men of God not so. <hi>I opened my mouth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezechiel. 3.</note>
saith <hi>Ezechiels</hi> and <hi>God reached me a scroule, saying son of
man cause thy belly to eat &amp; fill thy bowels with this I giue
thee, I eate it, and it was sweet in my mouth as hony,</hi> saith
the Prophet. Yea sweeter, I am perswaded, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hony or the hony combe. For herein they were
not like Harps or Lutes, but they felt, they felt the
power and strength of their owne words. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
spake of our peace, every corner of their hearts, was
filled with ioy. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they prophecied of mournings,
lamentations, and woes, to fall vpan vs; they wept in
the bitternes and indignation of spirit; the arme of
the Lord being mighty and strong vpon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:4395:8"/>
5 On this manner were all the prophecies of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
scripture. Which prophecies, although they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
nothing which is not profitable for our instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
yet as one starre differeth from another in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
so every word of prophecy hath a treasure of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in it, but all matters are not of like importance, as
al treasures are not of equal price. The chiefe &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
matter of prophecie is the promise of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
peace, holinesse, glory, victory, immortality
vnto every soule which beleeveth, that Iesus is
Christ, of the Iew first, and of the Gentile. Nowe
because the doctrine of salvation to bee looked
for by faith in him, who was in outward appearance
as it had beene a man forsaken of God, in him who
was numbred, Iudged, and condemned with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
in him whom men did see buffited on the face,
scoft at by Souldiers, scourged by tormentours, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on the crosse, pearced to the heart, in him whom
the eies of many witnesses did behold, when the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
of his soule enforced him to roare as if his hart
had rent in sunder, <hi>O my God, my God why haste thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
me?</hi> I say, because the doctrine of salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by him
is a thing improbable to a natural man, that whether
we preach it to the Gentile, or to the Iew, the one
condemneth our faith as madnes, the other as blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
therefore to establish and confirme the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety
of this saving trueth in the harts of men; the
Lord togither, with their preachings, whom hee sent
immediately from himselfe, to reveale these things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, mingled prophecies of things both ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4395:9"/>
and Ecclesiasticall, which were to come in everie
age from time to time, till the very last of the latter
daies; that by those things, wherein we see daily their
words fulfilled and done, we might haue strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
in the hope of things which are not seene,
because they haue revealed as well the one as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For when many things are spoken of before in
scripture, whereof we see first one thing accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and then another, and so a third, pereeiue wee not
plainely, that God doeth nothing else but lead vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
by the hand, til he haue setled vs vpon the rocke
of an assured hope, that no one iote or title of his
word shall passe till all be fulfilled? It is not therefore
saide in vaine, that these godlesse wicked ones were
<hi>spoken of before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6 But by whom? By them whose words, if men
or Angels from heauen gainesaie, they are accursed;
by them, whom whosoever despiseth, despiseth not
them, but me, saith Christ. If any man therefore doth
loue the Lord Iesus (and woe worth him that loueth
not the Lord Iesus!) hereby wee may know that hee
loveth him indeed, if hee despise not the things that
are spoken of by his Apostles;<note place="margin">A naturall man percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things.</note> whom many haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
even for the basenesse and simplenesse of their
persons. For it is the propertie of fleshly and carnall
men, to honour and dishonour, credit, and discredit
the words and deeds of every man according to that
he wanteth or hath without, If a man with gorgeous
apparell come amongst vs, although he bee a theese
or a murtherer (for there are theeues and murtherers
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4395:9"/>
in gorgeous apparell) be his heart whatsoever, If his
coat be of purple,<note place="margin">Iam. 2.</note> or velvet, or tissue, every one riseth
vp, and all the reverent solemnities wee can vse, are
too little. But the man that serveth God, is contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and despised amongst vs for his povertie.<note place="margin">Act. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Herod</hi>
speaketh in iudgement, and the people cry out, <hi>The
voice of God,</hi>

               <hi>and not of man. Paul</hi> preacheth Christ,
they tearme him a trifler. Harken beloued: hath not
God chosen the poore of this world, that they should
be rich in faith? hath hee not chosen the refuse of the
world to be heires of his kingdome, which hee hath
promised to them that loue him? hath he not chosen
the ofscowrings of men to be the lights of the world,
and the Apostles of Iesus Christ? Men vnlearned, yet
how fully replenished with vnderstanding? fewe in
number, yet how great in power? contemptible in
shew, yet in spirit how strong? how wonderfull? <hi>I
would faine learne the mysterie of the eternall generation
of the sonne of God,</hi> saith <hi>Hilary.</hi> Whom shall I seeke?
shall I get me to the schooles of the <hi>Grecians?</hi> why? I
haue read, <hi>vbi sapiens? vbi scriba? vbi conquisitor huius
seculi?</hi> These wise men in the world must needs bee
dumbe in this, because they haue reiected the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God. Shall I beseech the Scribes and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
of the law, to become my teachers? how can
they knowe this, sith they are offended at the crosse
of Christ? It is death for me to be ignorant of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
misterie of the sonne of God; of which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
notwit standing I should haue been ignorant,
but that a poore fisherman, vnknowne, vnlearned,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4395:10"/>
new come from his bote with his cloathes wringing
wet, hath opened his mouth and taught me, <hi>In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
was the word, and the word was with God, &amp; the
word was God.</hi> These poore sillie creatures haue made
vs rich in the knowledge of the mysteries of Christ.</p>
            <p>7 Remember therefore that which is spoken of
by the Apostles. Whose words if the children of this
world doe not regard, is it any marvaile? They are the
Apostles of our Lord Iesus; not of their Lord but of
our. It is true which one hath said in a certaine place,
<hi>Apostolicam fidem seculi homo non capit,</hi> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sworne
to the world, is not capable of that faith which the
Apostles doe teach. What meane the children of this
world then to tread in the courts of our God? What
should your bodies doe at <hi>Bethel,</hi> whose hearts are at
<hi>Bethaven?</hi> The God of this world, whom yee serue,
hath provided Apostles and teachers for you, <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,
wisards, Southsayers, Astrologers,</hi> and such like:
Heare them. Tell not vs that yee will sacrifice to the
Lord our God if wee will sacrifice to <hi>Ashteroth</hi> or
<hi>Melcom;</hi>
               <note place="margin">We must not halt between 2. opinions.</note> that yee will read our Scriptures, if wee will
listen to your traditions; that if yee may haue a Masse
by permission, wee shall haue a Communion with
good leaue and liking; that yee will admit the things
that are spoken of by the Apostles of our Lord Iesus,
if your Lord and Master may haue his ordinances ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>served,
and his statutes kept. <hi>Solomon</hi> tooke it (as well
he might) for an evident proofe, that she did not bear
a motherly affection to her child, which yeelded to
haue it cut in diverse parts. He cannot loue the Lord
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4395:10"/>
Iesus with his heart, which lendeth one care to his
Apostles, and another care to false Apostles: which
can brooke to see a mingle mangle of religion and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
Ministers and Massingpriests, light &amp; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
truth and errour, traditions and Scriptures. No;
we haue no Lord but Iesus; no doctrine but the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
no teachers but his Apostles. Were it reason to
require at the hands of an English subiect, obedience
to the lawes and edicts of the Spaniard? I doe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
that any man bearing the name of a servant of
the servants of Iesus Christ, will goe about to drawe
vs from our allegeance. Wee are his sworne subiects;
it is not lawful for vs to heare the things, that are not
told vs by his Apostles. They haue told vs that in the
last daies there shall be mockers; therefore wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
it: <hi>Credimus quia legimus,</hi> we are so perswaded
because we read it must be so. If we did not read it, we
would not teach it: <hi>Nam quae libro legis non continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
eanec nosse debemus,</hi> saith <hi>Hilary,</hi> those things that
are not written in the booke of the law, wee ought
not so much as to be acquainted with them. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the words which were spoken of before of the Apostles
of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8 The third thing to be considered in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of these men of whom wee speake is the
time, wherin they should be manifested to the world.
They tolde you there should bee mockers in the last
time.<note place="margin">Mockers in the last time.</note> 
               <hi>Noah</hi> at the commaundement of God built an
Arke, and there were in it beasts of all sorts, cleane &amp;
vncleane. A husbandman planteth a vineyard &amp; loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4395:11"/>
for grapes, but when they come to the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
behold togither with grapes there are found al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
wilde grapes. A rich man prepareth a great supper
and biddeth many, but when hee sitteth him downe
he findeth amongst his friends here and there a man
whom he knoweth not. This hath beene the state of
the Church sithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the beginning. God alwaies hath
mingled his Saints with faithlesse and godlesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
as it were the cleane with the vncleane, grapes
with sowre grapes, his friends and children with ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
and strangers. Mervaile not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if in the last daies
also yee see the men, with whom you liue and walke
arme in arme, laugh at your religion and blaspheme
that glorious name whereof you are called. Thus it
was in the daies of the patriarckes &amp; prophets; and
are we better then our fathers? Albeit we suppose
that the blessed Apostles in foreshewing what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of men were set out for the last daies, meant to
note a calamity speciall and peculiar to the ages and
generations which were to come. As if he shoulde
haue said; As God hath appointed a time of seed for
the sower, and a time of harvest for him that reapeth;
as he hath give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto every hearb &amp; every tree his own
fruit, and his own season, not the season nor the fruit
of another, (for no man looketh to gather figs in the
winter, because the Sommer is the season for them,
nor grapes of thistles, because grapes are the fruite of
the Vine,) so the same God hath appointed sund<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie
for every generation of men, other men for other
times, and for the last times the worst men, as may
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4395:11"/>
appeare by their properties, which is the fourth
point to be considered of in this description.</p>
            <p>9 They told you that there should be <hi>Mockers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mockers.</note>
He meaneth men that shall vse religion as a cloake to
put off, and on, as the weather serveth; such as shall
with <hi>Herod</hi> heare the preaching of <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to day,
and to morrow condescende to haue him beheaded;
or with the other <hi>Herod</hi> say, they will worship Christ
when they purpose a massacre in their hearts, kisse
Christ with <hi>Iudas,</hi> and betray Christ with <hi>Iudas.</hi>
These are mockers. For as <hi>ishmael</hi> the sonne of <hi>Hagar</hi>
laughed at <hi>Isaak,</hi> which was heire of the promise; so
shall these men laugh at you as the maddest people
vnder the sunne, if yee be like <hi>Moses,</hi> choosing rather
to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to
enioy the pleasures of sin for a season. And why? God
hath not given them eies to see, nor harts to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue
that exceeding recompence of your rewarde. The
promises of salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made to you are matters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they can take no pleasure, even as <hi>Ishmael</hi> tooke no
pleasure in that promise, wherein God had said vnto
<hi>Abraham, In Isaac shall thy seed be called,</hi> because the
promise concerned not him but <hi>Isaac.</hi> They are tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for their impiety towards God, <hi>mockers,</hi> and for
the impurity of their life and conversation, <hi>walkers
after their owne vngodly lusts. S. Peter</hi> in his second e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
and 3. chapter soundeth the very depth of their
impiety: shewing <hi>first,</hi> how they shall not shame at
the length to professe themselues prophane, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious,
by flat denying the gospell of Iesus Christ,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4395:12"/>
and deriding the sweet and comfortable promises of
his appearing: <hi>secondly,</hi> that they shall not be only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riders
of all religion, but also disputers against God, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
truth to subvert the truth; yea scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to disproue scriptures. Being in this sort <hi>moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
they must needs be also followers of <hi>their owne
vngodly lusts.</hi> Being Atheists in perswasion, can they
choose but be beasts in conversatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? For why remoue
they quite from them the feare God? Why take they
such paines to abandon and put out from their harts
all sense, all tast, all feeling of religion? but only to this
end and purpose, that they may without inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
and grudging of conscience giue over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to all vncleanenes. Surely the state of these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is more lamentable, then is the condition of Pagans
and Turkes. For at the bare beholding of heaven and
earth the infidels heart by and by doth giue him, that
there is an eternal,<note place="margin">Mockers worse then Pagans, and Infidels.</note> infinite, immortal, and everliving
God; whose hands haue fashioned and framed the
world; hee knoweth that every house is builded of
some man, though he see not the man which built the
house, and he considereth, that it must be God which
hath built and created all things; although because
the number of his daies be few he could not see whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
God disposed his workes of old, when he caused the
light of his clowds first to shine, when he laid the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
stone of the earth and swadled it with bands of
water and darknes; when he caused the morning star
to know his place, &amp; made barres and doores to shut
vp the sea within his house, saying, <hi>hitherto shalt thou
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4395:12"/>
come but no farther:</hi> he hath no eie switnesse of these
things. Yet the light of natural reason hath put this
wisdome in his reines, and hath given his heart thus
much vnderstanding. Bring a pagan to the schooles
of the prophets of God; prophecie to an infidell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
him, lay the iudgements of God before him,
make the secret sinnes of his heart manifest, and he
shall fall downe and worship God. They that cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

            <p>11 For your better vnderstanding, what this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering

meere mercy and loue towards vs. That which tieth
vs to him is our faith in the promised salvation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the word of truth. That which vniteth and

We, whose eies are too dimme to behold the inward

               <note place="margin">3. Apostasy.</note> And <hi>Saint Iude,</hi>
to expresse the manner of their departure, which by
<hi>Apostasie</hi> fell away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith of Christ, saith they
separated themselues: noting thereby, that it was not
constraint of others, which forced them to depart, it
was not infirmitie and weaknes in themselues, it was
not feare of persecution to come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, whereat
their hearts did faile; it was not griefe of torments,
whereof they had tasted, and were not able any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to endure them. No, they voluntarily did separate
themselues with a fully setled, and altogether deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
purpose never to name the Lord Iesus and
more, nor to haue any fellowship with his Saints, but
to bend all their counsell and all their strength to raze
out their memoriall from amongst men.</p>
            <p>12 Now because that by such examples, not
only the hearts of Infidels were hardned against the
truth, but the mindes of weake brethren also much
troubled, the holy Ghost hath given sentence of these
backsliders, that they were carnall men, and had not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4395:14"/>
the spirit of Christ Iesus, least any man hauing an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verweening
of their persons should be overmuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
and offended at their fall. For simple men not
able to discerne their spirits, were brought by their
apostasie thus to reason with themselues. If Christ be
the sonne of the liuing God, if hee haue the words of
eternall life, if he be able to bring salvation to all men
that come vnto him, what meaneth this Apostasie
and vnconstrained departure? Why doe his servants
so willingly forsake him? Babes be not deceived, his
servants forsake him not. They that separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
were amongst his servants, but if they had been
of his servants, they had not separated themselues.
They were amongst vs, not of vs, saith <hi>Saint Iohn:</hi>
and <hi>Saint Iude</hi> proveth it, because they were carnall,
and had not the spirit. Will you iudge of wheat by
chaffe which the winde hath scattered from amongst
it? Haue the children no bread because the dogs haue
not tasted it? Are Christians deceived of that salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they looked for, because they denied the ioies of the
life to come which were not Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? What if they
seemed to bee pillers and principall vpholders of our
faith? What is that to vs, which know that Angels
haue fallen from heaven? Although if these men had
beene of vs indeed, (O the blessednes of a Christian
mans estate!) they had stood surer then the Angels,
they had never departed from their place. Whereas
now we mervaile not at their departure at all, neither
are we prejudiced by their falling away, because they
were not of vs, sith they are fleshly and haue not the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4395:15"/>
spirit. Children abide in the house for ever; they are
bondmen and bondwomen which are cast out.</p>
            <p>13 It behoveth you therefore greatly every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to examine his owne estate, and to try whether you
be bond or free, children or no children. I haue tolde
you already, that we must beware we presume not to
sit as Gods in iudgement vpon others, and rashlie, as
our conceipt and fancie doth lead vs, so to determine
of this man he is sincere, or of that man, he is an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrit,
except by their falling away they make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
and knowne what they are. For who art thou
that takest vpon thee to iudge another before the

whereby we may at any time giue true &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
sentence vpon our selues. We cannot examine
the harts of other men, we may our owne. That we
haue passed from death to life, we knowe it, saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

yee bee reprobates? I trust, beloued, wec knowe
that wee are not reprobates, because our spirit doth
bear vs record, that the faith of our Lord Iesus Christ
is in vs.</p>
            <p>14 It is as easie a matter for the spirit within you
to tell whose yee are, as for the eies of your body to
iudge where you sit, or in what place you stand. For
what saith the Scripture? Yee, which were in times
past strangers and enimies, because your minds were
set on evill workes, Christ hath now reconciled in
the body of his flesh through death, to make you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4395:15"/>
and vnblameable, and without fault in his sight: if
you continue grounded and established in the faith,
and bee not moved away from the hope of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
<hi>Colos.</hi> 1. And in the third to the <hi>Coloss.</hi> yee knowe
that of the Lord yee shall receiue the reward of that
inheritance, for yee serue the Lord Christ. If wee can
make this account with our selues; I was in times past
dead in trespasses and sinnes, I walked after the prince
that ruleth in the aire, &amp; after the spirit that worketh
in the children of disobedience; but God, who is rich
in mercy, through his great loue, wherewith he loued
me, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when I was dead, hath quickned me in Christ.
I was fierce, heady, proud, high minded; but God hath
made me like the child that is newly wained: I loved
pleasures more then God; I followed greedily the
ioies of this present world; I esteemed him, that erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a stage or theatre, more then <hi>Solomon</hi> which built
a Temple to the Lord; the Harpe, Viole, Timbrell, &amp;
Pipe men singers &amp; wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> singers were at my feasts,
it was my felicity to see my children dance before me,
I said of every kind of vanitie, O how sweet art thou
vnto my soule! All which things now are crucified to
me, and J to them: now I hate the pride of life, and
pompe of this world; now I take as great delight in
the way of thy testimonies, O Lord, as in all riches,
now I finde more ioy of heart in my Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
then the worldly minded man, when his wheate
and oyle do much abound: now I tast nothing sweet,
but the bread that came downe from heaven, to giue
life vnto the world: now mine eyes see nothing, but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4395:16"/>
Iesus rising from the dead: now my eare refuseth all
kind of melodie to heare the song of them that haue
gotten victory of the beast, and of his image, and of
his marke, and of the number of his name, that stand
on the sea of glasse, hauing the harpes of God, and
singing the song of <hi>Moses</hi> the servant of God, and the
song of the Lambe, saying, Great and marvailous are
thy workes, Lord God Almightie, iust, &amp; true are thy
waies, O king of Saints. Surely if the spirit haue been
thus effectuall in the secret worke of our regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vnto newnesse of life; if wee endeavour thus to
frame our selues anew, then we may say boldly with
the blessed Apostle in the 10. to the <hi>Hebrewes, we are
not of them which withdraw our selues to perdition, but
which follow faith to the conservation of the soule.</hi> For
they that fall away from the grace of God, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
themselues vnto perdition, they are fleshly and
carnall, they haue not Gods holy spirit. But vnto you,
because yee are sonnes, God hath sent forth the spirit
of his sonne into your hearts, to the end yee might
knowe, that Christ hath built you vpon a rocke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable,
that he hath registred your names in the

and everlasting covenant to be your God, &amp; the God
of your children after you, that hee hath suffered as

            <p>Hereby it is come to passe, as you see this day, that

hath made the earth so drunke that it hath reeled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
vs, I know your godly hearts would loath to see

filth, I had rather take a garment vpon my shoulders,

Lord open their eies, and cause them, if it be possible,
at the length to see, how they are wretched, and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and poore, and blinde, and naked! Put it O Lord
in their hearts to seeke white raiment, and to cover
themselues, that their filthy nakednes may no longer
appeare! For, beloved in Christ, we bow our knees, &amp;
lift vp our hands to heaven in our chambers secretly,

out as a Iudge in a solemne declaratory sentence of

only not to haue any holy assemblies vnto the Lorde
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4395:19"/>

flattery, to hold sacrilege to be Gods service, vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
and breach of promise to God to giue it to a

confession, to mislike with penance, to like well of

good before God in single life, nor in no well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;

the world, and by provocation of the flesh, or by any
other meanes forcible to deceaue them, and likely to
estrange their heartt from God. For God is not at
that point with vs, that hee careth not whether wee
sinke or swimme. No, he hath written our names in
the palme of his hand, in the signet vpon his finger are
we graven, in sentences not onely of mercy, but of

priviledged persons, <hi>Touch not mine annointed,
doe my Prophets no harme, hurt not the earth, nor the sea,
nor the trees, till wee haue sealed the servants of God in
their foreheads.</hi> Hee never speaketh of godlesse men,
but he adioineth words of comfort, or admonition,
or exhortation, whereby wee are moued to rest and
settle our hearts on him. In the second to Tim. the 3.
Chap. <hi>Evil men;</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>and deceiuers shall
waxe worse and worse, deceiuing and being deceiued. But
continue thou in the things, which thou hast learned.</hi> And
in the first to Tim. the. 6. Chap. <hi>Some men lusting after
money have erred from the faith, &amp; pierced themselues
through with many sorrowes. But thou, ô man of God, fly
these things, and follow after righteousnesse godlines, faith

the second Chap. <hi>They that have not receiued
the loue of the truth, that they might bee saued, God shall
send them strong delusions, that they may beleeue lies. But
we ought to giue thanks alway to God for you, brethren,
beloued of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning

            <p>3 These sweet exhortations, which God put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

               </gap>teth not in heaven carelesse and vnmindfull of our

will hardly forget her child. But if a mother bee
happily found vnnaturall, and doe forget the fruit of
her owne wombe, yet Gods iudgements shew plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he cannot forget, the man whose heart hee
hath framed and fashioned a new in simplicity and
truth to serue and feare him. For when the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of man was so great, and the earth so filled with
crueltie, that it could not stand with the righteousnes
of God any longer to forbeare, wrathfull sentences
brake out from him like wine from a vessell that hath
no vent. <hi>My spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen 6 3 &amp; 13</note> saith he, <hi>can struggle and striue no

            </p>
            <p>4 Doe we not see what shift God doth make
for <hi>Lot,</hi> and for his familie in the 19. of Genesis, least
the fierie destruction of the wicked should overtake
him? Overnight the Angels make enquiry, what sons
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4395:22"/>
or daughters, or sonnes in law, what wealth and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
he had. They charge him to carie out al, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
thou hast in the citie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen 19. 12.</note> 
               <hi>bring it out.</hi> God seemeth
to stand in a kind of feare, least something or other
would be left behind. And his will was that nothing
of that which he had, not an hoofe of any beast, not
a threed of any garment should bee singed with that
fire. In the morning the Angels fayle not to call him
vp,<note place="margin">Gen 19. 15.</note> and to hasten him forward, <hi>Arise, take thy wife, &amp;
thy daughters which are here, that they be not destroyed in
the punishment of the Citie.</hi> The Angels hauing spoken
againe and againe, <hi>Lot</hi> for all this, lingereth out the
time still, till at the length they were forced to take
<hi>both him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 16.</note> 
               <hi>and his wife, and his daughters by the armes (the
Lord being mercifull vnto him</hi>) and to cary them forth
and set them without the citie.</p>
            <p>5 Was there ever any father thus carefull to
saue his child from the flame? A man would thinke,
that now being spoken vnto to escape for his life, and
not to looke behinde him, nor to tarry in the plaine,
but to hasten to the mountaine &amp; there to saue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
he should do it gladly. Yet behold, now he is so
farre off from a chearefull &amp; willing hart to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is commanded him for his owne weale, that
he beginneth to reason the matter, as if God had mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
one place for another, sending him to the hill
when salvation was in the Citie. <hi>Not so, my Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Behold, thy servant hath found grace in thy
sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou haste
shewed vnto me in saving my life. I cannot escape in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4395:22"/>
mountaine, least some evil take me and I die. Here is a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hard by, a small thing. O let me escape thither (is it not a
small thing?) and my soule shall liue.</hi> Well, God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to yeeld to any conditions. <hi>Behold I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thy request concerning this thing also. I will spare this
City, for which thou hast spoken; hast thee; saue thee there.
For I can do nothing till thou come thither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6 Hee could doe nothing! Not because of the
weaknesse of his strength (for who is like vnto the
Lord in power?) but because of the greatnesse of his
mercy which would not suffer him to lift vp his arme
against that City, nor to power out his wrath vpon
that place, where his righteous servant had a fancie
to remaine, and a desire to dwell. O the depth of the
riches of the mercy and loue God! God is afraide to
offend vs which are not afraid to displease him! God
can do nothing till he haue saved vs, which can finde
in our harts rather to do any thing then to serue him.
It contenteth him not to exempt vs, when the pit is
digged for the wicked; to comfort vs at every menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is made of reprobates and godlesse men; to
saue vs as the apple of his owne eie when fire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
downe from heaven to consume the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the earth, except every Prophet and every A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
and every servant, whom he sendeth forth, doe
come loaden with these and the like exhortations, <hi>O
beloved, edifie your selues in your most holy faith. Giue
your selues to praier in the spirit, keepe your selues in the
loue of God. Looke for the mercie of our Lord Iesus Christ
vnto eternall life.</hi>

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:4395:23"/>
7 <hi>Edifie your selues.</hi> The speech is borrowed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
material builders, and must be spiritually vnderstood.
It appeareth in the 6. of <hi>S. Iohns</hi> gospel by the Iewes,
that their mouthes did water too much for bodilie
food, <hi>Our fathers,</hi> say they, <hi>did eate Manna in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
is it is written, He gaue them bread from heaven to
eate; Lord, evermore give vs of this bread!</hi> Our Saviour,
to turne their appetite another way, maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this
answere, <hi>I am the bread of life, hee that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to me shall
not hunger, and hee that beleeveth in mee, shall never
thirst.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8 An vsuall practise it is of Satan to cast heapes
of worldly baggage in our way, that whilest we desire
to heape vp gold as dust, wee may be brought at the
length to esteeme vilely that spiritual blisse. Christ, in
the 6. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> to correct this evill affection, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vs in minde to lay vp treasure for our selues in
heaven. The Apostle, 1. <hi>Tim. 3. chapt.</hi> misliking the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of those wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which attired themselues more
costly, then beseemed the heavenly calling of such as
professed the feare of God, willeth them to cloath
themselues with shamefastnes and modestie, and to
put on the apparel of good workes. <hi>Taliter pigmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatae
Deum habebitis amatorem,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Put on
righteousnesse as a garment: in steed of Civit haue
Faith, which may cause a savour of life to issue from
you, and God shall be enamoured, he shal be ravished
with your beauty. These are the ornaments, &amp; brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
and jewels, which inflame the loue of Christ, and
set his hart on fire vpon his spowse. We see, how he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4395:23"/>
breaketh out in the Canticles at the beholding of
this attire, How faire art thou, and how pleasant art
thou, O my loue, in these pleasures!</p>
            <p>9 And perhaps <hi>S. Iude</hi> exhorteth vs here not to
build our houses but our selues, forseeing by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Almighty, which was with him, that there
should be men in the last daies like to those in the first,
which should encourage and stirre vp each other to
make bricke &amp; to burne it in the fire, to build houses
huge as cities, and towers as high as heaven, thereby
to get them a name vpon earth; men that shoulde
turne out the poore, and the fatherlesse, and the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
to build places of rest for dogs &amp; swine in their
roomes; men that should lay houses of praier even
with ground, and make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stables where Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
haue worshipped before the Lord. Surely this is a
vanity of all vanities, and it is much amongst men, a
speciall sicknesse of this age. What it should meane, I
know not, except God haue set the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on worke to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
fewel against that day, when the Lord Iesus shal
shew himselfe from heaven with his mighty angels
in flaming fire. What good commeth vnto the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of these things, saith <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 5.</note> but only the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
thereof with their eies? <hi>Martha, Martha, thou
busiest thy selfe about many things, One thing is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi>
Yee are too busie, my brethren, with timber, and
bricke; They haue chosen the better part, they haue
taken a better course, that build themselues. Yee are
the Temples of the living God; as God hath said, I
wil dwel in them, and will walke in them, &amp; they shal
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4395:24"/>
be my people, and I wil be their God.</p>
            <p>10 Which of you wil gladly remaine, or abide
in a mishapen, a ruinous, or a broken house? And shal
we suffer sinne, and vanity to drop in at our eies, and
at our eares, at every corner of our bodies, &amp; of our
soules, knowing that we are the Temples of the holy
Ghost? Which of you receiveth a guest, whom he
honoureth, or whom he loveth, and doth not sweepe
his chamber against his comming? And shal we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the chamber of our hearts and consciences to lie
full of vomiting, full of filth, ful of garbidge knowing
that Christ hath said, I, and my Father will come, and
dwell with you? Is it meete for your Oxen to lay in
parlours, and your selues to lodge in cribs? Or is it
seemely for your selues to dwell in your setled hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and the house of the Almighty to lie wast, whose
house yee are your selues? Do not our eies behold,
how God every day overtaketh the wicked in their
iourneies, how suddenly they pop downe into the
pit? how Gods iudgements for their times come so
swiftly vpon them, that they haue not the leasure to
crie, Alas? how their life is cut off like a threed in a
moment? how they passe like a shadow? how they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
their mouthes to speake, and God taketh them
even in the midst of a vaine or an idle word? And dare
we for all this lay downe, take our rest, eate our meat
securely and carelesly in the midst of so great and so
many ruines? Blessed and praised for ever and ever be
his name, who perceiuing of how senselesse &amp; heavy
mettall we are made,<note place="margin">The sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the L. Supper.</note> hath instituted in his Church a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4395:24"/>
spirituall supper, and an holy communion, to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
often, that we might thereby bee occasioned
often to examine these buildings of ours, in what case
they stand. For sith God doth not dwell in Temples
which are vncleane, sith a shrine cannot be a sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vnto him; and this supper is receaued as a seale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, that we are his house and his sanctuarie, that his
Christ is as truly vnited to me, and I to him, as my
arme is vnited and knit vnto my shoulder, that hee
dwelleth in me as verily as the elements of bread and
wine abide within me, which perswasion, by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
these dreadfull mysteries, we professe our selues
to haue; a due comfort, if truly, and if in hypocrisie,
then woe worth vs. Therefore ere wee put forth our

to examine, and to trie our hearts whether God bee

we be found the temples of the holy Ghost, then
to iudge, whether we haue had such regard every one
to our building, that the spirit which dwelleth in vs
hath no way beene vexed, molested, and grieued. Or

            <p>11 Receiving the sacrament of the Supper of
the Lord, after this sort (you that are spiritual, iudge
what I speake) is not all other wine like the water of

Is not <hi>Manna</hi> like to gall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and our bread like to <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na?</hi>
Is there not a tast, a tast of Christ Iesus in the hart
of him that eateth? Doth not hee which drinketh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

<hi>Satan,</hi> and haue overcome that evill. <hi>Fathers,</hi> I speake
it also to you, yee are his house, because yee haue
knowne him, which is from the beginning. Sweete
<hi>Babes,</hi> I speake it even to you also; yee are his house,
because your sinnes are forgiven you for his name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake.
<hi>Matrons</hi> and <hi>Sisters,</hi> I may not hold it from you,
yee are also the Lords building, and, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
heires of the grace of life as well as we. Though
it be forbidden you to open your mouthes in publike
assemblies, yet yee must bee inquisitiue in things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this building, which is of God, with your hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
and friends at home, not as <hi>Dalila</hi> with <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
but as <hi>Sara</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> whose daughters yee
are, whilst yee doe well, and build your selues.</p>
            <p>13 Having spoken thus farre of the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4395:25"/>
as whereby we are called vpon to edifie and build
our selues. It remaineth now, that wee consider the
thing prescribed, namely wherein we must bee built.
This prescription standeth also vpon two points, the
<hi>thing</hi> prescribed, and the <hi>adiuncts</hi> of the <hi>thing.</hi> And
that is our most pure, and <hi>holy faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14 The thing prescribed is <hi>Faith.</hi> For as in a
chaine, which is made of many linkes, if you pull the
first, you drawe the rest; and as in a ladder of many
staues, if you take away the lowest, all hope of ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the highest will be remoued, So because all
the precepts and promises in the law and in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
doe hang vpon this, <hi>Beleeue;</hi> and because the last
of the graces of God doth so follow the first, that he
glorifieth none, but whom he hath iustified, nor iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
any, but whom he hath called to a true, effectual,
and liuely faith in Christ Iesus, therefore S <hi>Iude</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
vs to <hi>build our selues,</hi> mentioneth here expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
only faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the thing wherein we must be edified,
for that faith is the ground and the glorie of all the
welfare of this building.</p>
            <p>15 Yee are not strangers &amp; forrainers,<note place="margin">Ephes:</note> but citizens
with the Saints, and of the houshold of God, <hi>saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stle,</hi>
and are built vpon the foundation of the Prophets &amp;
Apostles, Iesus Christ himselfe being the cheefe corner
stone, in whom all the building being coupled together,
groweth vnto an holy Temple in the Lord, in whom yee
also are built together to be the habitation of God by the
spirit. <hi>And we are the habitation of God by the spi<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t,
if we beleeue. For it is written, whosoever confesseth</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:4395:26"/>
that Iesus is the sonne of God, in him God dwelleth,
and he in God. The strength of this habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is great;
it prevaileth against Satan; it conquereth sinne; it hath
death in derision; neither principalities, nor powers
can throwe it downe; it leadeth the world captiue, &amp;
bringeth every enimie, that riseth vp against it, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
and shame, and all by faith; for this is the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
that overcommeth the world, even our faith.
Who is it that overco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the world,<note place="margin">1 Ioh 4 1. Ioh. 5.</note> but hee which
beleeueth, that Iesus is the sonne of God?</p>
            <p>16 The strength of every building, which is of
God, standeth not in any mans armes or legs: it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in our faith, as the valour of <hi>Sampson</hi> lay only in his
haire. This is the reason, why wee are so earnestly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vpon to <hi>edifie our selues in faith.</hi> Not as if this bare
action of our minds, whereby wee beleeue the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of Christ, were able in it selfe as of it selfe to make
vs vnconquerable and invincible, like stones, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
in the building for ever and fall not out. No, it is
not the worthinesse of our beleeuing, it is the vertue
of him in whom we beleeue, by which we stand sure
as houses that are builded vpon a rocke. He is a wise
man,<note place="margin">Mat 7.</note> which hath builded his house vpon a rocke; for
he hath chosen a good foundation, and no doubt his
house will stand. But how shall it stand? verily by the
strength of the rocke which beareth it, &amp; by nothing
else. Our fathers, whom God delivered out of the
land of Egypt, were a people that had no peeres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the nations of the earth, because they were
built by faith vpon the rocke, which rocke is Christ.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4395:26"/>
               <hi>And the rocke,</hi> saith the Apostle in the first to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
the tenth Chapter, <hi>did follow him.</hi> Whereby
we learne not only this, that being built by faith on
Christ as on a rocke,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> and grafted into him as into an
Oliue, wee receiue all our strength and fatnesse from
him, but also that this strength and fatnesse of ours
ought to be no cause why we should be high minded
and not workeout our salvation with a reverent, tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
and holy feare. For if thou boastest thy selfe of
thy faith, knowe this that Christ chose his Apostles,
his Apostles chose not him; that Israel followed not
the rocke, but the rocke followed Israel, and that thou
bearest not the roote, but the root thee. So that every
heart must this thinke, and every tongue must
thus speake, <hi>Not vnto vs, O Lord, not vnto vs,</hi> nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any thing which is within vs, but vnto thy name
onely, only to thy name belongeth all the praise of al
the treasures and riches of every Temple which is of
God. This excludeth al boasting and vaunting of our
faith.</p>
            <p>17 But this must not make vs carelesse to edifie
our selues in faith. It is the Lord that delivereth mens
soules from death, but not except they put their trust
in his mercy. It is God that hath given vs eternall life,<note place="margin">1. Joh <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </note>
but no otherwise then thus, If wee beleeue in the
name of the sonne of God; for hee that hath not the
sonne of God hath not life. It was the spirit of the
Lord which came vpon <hi>Sampson,</hi> &amp; made him strong
to teare a lion as a man would rent a kid: but his
strength forsooke him, and he became like other men
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4395:27"/>
when the razer had touched his head. It is the power
of God whereby the faithfull haue subdued king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,

them? are they not like vnto other men?</p>
            <p>18 If yee desire yet farther to knowe how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
and ne<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<hi>without faith it is impossible to please God.</hi> If I offer

all this availeth nothing.<note place="margin">No pleasing of God with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out faith.</note> 
               <hi>Without faith it is impossible

that we might worke the workes of God,</hi> maketh answer,
<hi>This is the worke of God, that yee beleeue in him, whom hee
hath sent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19 That no worke of ours, no building of our
selues in any thing can be available or profitable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, except we be edified &amp; built in faith, what need
we to seeke about for long proofe? looke vpon Israel,
once the very chosen and peculiar of God, to whom
the adoption of the faithfull, and the glory of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins,
and the covenants of mercy, and the lawe of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4395:27"/>
               <hi>Moses,</hi> and the service of God, and the promises of
Christ were made impropriate, who not onely were
the ofspring of <hi>Abraham,</hi> father vnto all them which
doe beleeue, but Christ their ofspring, which is God
to be blessed for evermore.</p>
            <p>20 Consider this people and learne, what it is to
<hi>build your selues in faith.</hi> They were the Lords vine: he
brought it out of Egypt, he threwe out the heathen
from their places, that it might be planted, hee made
roome for it, and caused it to take roote, till it had fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the earth, the mountaines were covered with the
shadowe of it, and the boughs thereof were as the
goodly Cedars. She stretched out her branches vnto
the sea and her boughs vnto the river. But when God
hauing sent both his servants and his sonne to visite
this vine, they neither spared the one, nor receiued
the other, but stoned the Prophets, and crucified the
Lord of glory which came vnto them, then beganne
the curse of God to come vpon them, even the curse
whereof the Prophet <hi>David</hi> hath spoken, saying, <hi>Let
their table be made a snare,</hi>

               <hi>Well,</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,

time for the hardnesse of our hearts be broken off,
it will be such a iudgement, as will amaze all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and principalities which are aboue. Who hath

and who doth not see that <hi>infidelitie</hi> doth threaten

in the eleventh to the <hi>Romans,</hi> are plaine enough, <hi>If

heed, <hi>least he spare not thee.</hi> Build thy selfe in faith. Thus
much of the thing which is prescribed, and wherein
we are exhorted to edifie our selues. Now consider
the <hi>conditions</hi> and <hi>properties,</hi> which are in this place
annexed vnto faith. The former of them (for there
are but two) is this, <hi>Edifie your selues in your faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21. A strange, and a strong delusion it is where
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4395:28"/>
with the <hi>man of sinne</hi> hath bewitched the world; a
forcible spirit of errour it must needs be, which hath
brought men to such a senselesse &amp; vnreasonable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
as this is, not only that men cloathed with
mortalitie and sinne as we our selues are, can doe God
so much service, as shall bee able to make a full and a
perfect satisfaction before the Tribunall seate of God
for their owne sinnes, yea a great deale more, then is
sufficient for themselues; But also that a man at the
hands of a Bishop or a Pope, for such or such a price,
may buie the <hi>overplus</hi> of other mens merits, purchase
the fruits of other mens labours, and build his soule
by another mans faith. Is not this man drowned in
the gall of bitternesse? Is his heart right in the sight
of God? Can he haue any part or fellowship with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and with the <hi>successours</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> which thinketh
so vilely of building the pretious Temples of the holy
Ghost? Let his money perish with him, and he with it,
because he iudgeth, that the gift of God may bee sold
for money.</p>
            <p>22 But, Beloued in the Lord, deceaue not your
selues, neither suffer ye your selues to be deceaued: ye
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>receiue no more ease nor comfort for your soules
by an other mans faith, then warmth for your bodies
by another mans cloathes, or sustenance by the bread
which another doeth eate. The iust shall liue by his

No <hi>saint</hi> or <hi>martyr</hi> can cleanse himselfe of his

Edifie your selues in your <hi>owne</hi> most holy faith. And
let this be observed for the first <hi>propertie</hi> of that,
wherein we ought to edifie our selues.</p>
            <p>23 Our faith being such, is that indeed, which
S. <hi>Iude</hi> doth here terme <hi>Faith,</hi> namely a thing most
<hi>holy.</hi> The reason is this. We are iustified by <hi>Faith.</hi> For
<hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued, and this was imputed vnto him
for righteousnesse. Being iustified, all our iniquities
are covered, God beholdeth vs in the righteousnesse
which is imputed, and not in the sinnes which wee
haue committed.</p>
            <p>24 It is true, wee are full of sinne both <hi>originall,</hi>
and <hi>actuall;</hi> whosoever denieth it is a double sinner,
for he is both a <hi>sinner,</hi> and a <hi>lyer.</hi> To denie sinne, is
most plainely and cleerely to proue it, because he that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4395:29"/>
faith, he hath no sinne, lyeth, and by lying proueth
that he hath sinne.</p>
            <p>25. But <hi>imputation</hi> of righteousnesse hath cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the sinnes of every soule which beleeveth; God by
pardoning our sinne hath taken it away: so that now
although our transgressions be multiplied aboue the
haires of our head, yet being iustified wee are as free,
and as cleere, as if there were no one spot, or staine
of any vncleanesse in vs. For it is God that iustifieth,
and who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods
chosen? saith the Apostle in the 8. ch. to the Romans.</p>
            <p>26 Now sinne being taken away, wee are made
the righteousnesse of God in Christ. For <hi>David</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of this righteousnesse, saith, <hi>Blessed is the man
whole iniquities are forgiuen.</hi> No man is blessed but in
the righteousnesse of God. Every man, whose sinne
is taken away is blessed. Therefore every man, whose
sinne is covered, is made the righteousnesse of God
in Christ. The righteousnes doth m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke vs to appeare
most holy, most pure, most vnblamable before him.</p>
            <p>27 This then is the summ of that which I say, faith
doth iustifie: iustification washeth away sin: sin remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
we are cloathed with the righteousnes which is
of God: the righteousnes of God maketh vs most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Every of these I haue proved by the testimony of
Gods owne mouth. Therefore I conclude, that faith
is that which maketh vas most holy, in consideration
whereof it is called in this place, <hi>Our most holy faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>28 To make a wicked and a sinful man most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
through his beleeuing, is more then to create a
world of nothing. Our faith most holy? Surely <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:4395:30"/>
could not shew the Queene of <hi>Saba</hi> so much
treasure in all his kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, as is lapt vp in these words.
O that our hearts were stretched out like tents, &amp; that
the eies of our vnderstanding were as bright as the
sunne, that we might throughly knowe the rich<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of
the glorious inheritance of Saints, and what is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
greatnesse of his power towards vs, whome
he accepteth for pure, and most holy, through our
beleeuing. O that the spirit of the Lord would giue
this doctrine entrance into the stonie and brasen hart
of the Iew, which followeth the law of righteousnes
but cannot attaine vnto the righteousnesse of the
law. Wherefore? saith the Apostle. They seeke righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
and not by faith. Wherefore they stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at Christ, they are bruised, shivered to peeces as a
ship that hath runne her selfe vpon a rocke. O that
God would cast downe the eies of the prowd, and
humble the soules of the high minded, that they
might at the length abhorre the garments of their
owne flesh which cannot hide their nakednesse, and
put on the faith of Christ Iesus, as hee did put it on,
which hath said; <hi>Doubtlesse I thinke all things but losse
for the excellent knowledge sake of Christ Iesus my Lord,
for whom I haue counted all things losse, and doe iudge
them to be dung, that I might winne Christ, and might be
found in him, not hauing mine owner righteousnes, which
is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ,
even the righteousnesse which is of God through faith.</hi> O
that God would open the Arke of mercy, wherein
this doctrine lyeth, and set it wide before the eies of
poore afflicted consciences, which fly vp and downe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4395:30"/>
vpon the water of their afflictions, &amp; can see nothing
but only the gulfe and deluge of their sinnes, wherein
there is no place for them to rest their feet. The God
of pittie and compassion giue you al strength &amp; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
every day, and every houre, &amp; every moment, to
build, and edifie your selues in this most pure &amp; holy
faith. And thus much both of the thing prescribed in
this exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; also of the properties of the thing.
Build your selues in your most holy faith. I would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
to the next branch, which is of <hi>Prayer,</hi> but I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not lay
this matter out of my ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, til I haue added somwhat
for the applying of it both to other, &amp; to our selues.</p>
            <p>29 For your better vnderstanding of matters
contained in this exhortation, <hi>Build your selues,</hi> you
must note, that every Church and congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth
consist of a multitude of beleeuers, as every house is
built of many stones. And although the nature of the
mystical body of the Church be such, that it suffereth
no distinction in the invisible members, but whether
it be <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> Prince or Prophet, hee that is
taught, or he that teacheth, all are equally Christs, &amp;
Christ is equally theirs: yet in the externall admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Church of God, because God is not
the author of confusion but of peace, it is necessary
that in every Congregation there be a distinction, if
not of inward dignitie, yet of outward degree: so that
all are Saints, or seeme to be Saints, and should bee as
they seeme. But are all Apostles? If the whole bodie
were an eie, where were then the hearing? God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath giuen some to be Apostles, and some to be
Pastours, &amp;c. for the edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body of Christ.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4395:31"/>
In which worke we are Gods labourers, saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
&amp; yee are Gods husbandry, &amp; Gods building.</p>
            <p>30 The Church respected with reference vnto
administration ecclesiastical, doth generally consist
but of 2 sorts of men, the <hi>Labourers,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Building;</hi>
they which are ministred vnto and they to whom the
worke of the ministery is committed; <hi>Pastours</hi> &amp; the
<hi>flocke,</hi> over whom the holy Ghost hath made them
overseers If the <hi>Guid</hi> of a Congregation, be his name
or his degree whatsoever, be diligent in his vocation,
feed the flocke of God which dependeth vpon him,
caring for it not by constraint but willingly, not for
filthie lucre, but of a ready mind, not as though hee
would tyrannize over Gods heritage, but as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
vnto the flocke, wisely guiding them: if the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
in their degree doe yeeld themselues frameable to
the truth, not like rough stone or flint refusing to bee
smoothed and squared for the building: if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
doe carefully and diligently survey the whole
order of the worke, providing by statutes and lawes,
&amp; bodily punishments, if need require, that all things
may be done according to the rule which cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue,
even as <hi>Moses</hi> provided that all things might
be done according to the patterne which hee saw in
the Mount; there the words of this exhortation are
truely and effectually heard. Of such a Congregation
every man will say, <hi>Behold a people that are wise, a people
that walke in the statutes and ordinances of their God, a
people full of knowledge and vnderstanding, a people that
haue skill in building themselues.</hi> Where it is otherwise
there, <hi>as by slothfulnesse the roofe doth decay,</hi> &amp; as <hi>by idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4395:31"/>
of hinds the house droppeth thorough,</hi> as it is in the
10. of Ecclesiastes, v. 18; so first one peece and then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
of their building shal fall away, till there be not
a stone left vpon a stone.</p>
            <p>31 We see how fruitlesse this exhortation hath
bene to such as bend all their trauaile onely to build
manage a <hi>Papacie</hi> vpon earth, without any care in the
world of building the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in their most holy faith.
Gods people haue enquired at their mouthes, <hi>What
shall wt doe to haue eternall life?</hi> where-in shall we build
edifie our selues? And they haue departed ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
their Prophets, &amp; from their preists, laden with doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
which are precepts of men; they haue bene
taught to tire out themselues with bodily excercise;
those thinges are inioyned them which God did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
require at their hands, and the things he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
are kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; their eies are fed with pictures,
and their eares filled with melodie, but their soules
doe wither, and starue, and pine away; they crie for
bread, and behold stones are offered them; they aske
for fishe, and see they haue scorpions in their hands;
Thou seest, O Lord, that they builde themselues, but
not in faith; they feede their children but not with
food; Their rulers say with shame, Bring, &amp; not build.
But god is righteous; their dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kennesse stinketh, their
abominations ate knowne, their madnesse is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
the winde hath bound them vp in hir wings, and
they shall be ashamed of their doings. <hi>Ephraim,</hi> saith
the <hi>Prophet,</hi> is ioyned to Idoles, let him alone, I will
turne me therfore from the Preists which do minister
vnto Idoles, &amp; applie this exhortation to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4395:32"/>
god hath appointed to feede his chosen in Israell.</p>
            <p>32 If their be any feeling of Christ, and drop of
heavenly dewe any spark of Gods good spirit within
you, stirre it vp, be careful to build and edifie first your
selues, &amp; then your flockes in this most holy faith.</p>
            <p>33 I say, <hi>first your selues;</hi> For he which wil set the
hearts of other men on fire with the loue of Christ,
must himselfe burne with loue. It is want of faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
selues, My Brethren, which maketh vs<note n="*" place="margin">Carelesse.</note> retchlesse
in building others. We forsake the Lords inheritance
and seed it not. What is the reason of this? Our own
desires are setled where they should not be. Wee our
selues are like those women which haue a longing to
eate coales, and lime, and filth; we are fed, some with
honour, some with ease, some with wealth; the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
waxeth loathsome &amp; vnpleasant in our tast; how
should we then haue a care to feed others with that
which we cannot fancie our selues? If <hi>faith</hi> wax cold,
and slender in the <hi>heart</hi> of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> it will soone
perish from the eares of the people. The Prophet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi>
speaketh of a famine,<note place="margin">Amos 8. 11.</note> saying, <hi>I will send a famine in
the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but
of hearing the word of the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Men shall wander from
sea to sea, and from the north vnto the east shall they runne
to and fro to seeke the word of the Lord, and shall not find
it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Iudgement must beginne at the house of God,</hi> saith <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
Yea, I say, at the sanctuarie of God this iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
must begin. This famine must begin at the hart of the
Prophet. He must haue darknes for a vision, hee must
stumble at noone daies, as at the twi-light, and then
truth shall fall in middest of the streets, then shall the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4395:32"/>
people wander from sea to sea, and from the North
vnto the east shall they runne to and fro to seeke the
word of the Lord.</p>
            <p>34 In the second of Haggaie, <hi>speake now,</hi> saith God
to his prophet, <hi>Speake now to Zerubbabel the son of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altiel
Prince of Iudah, &amp; to Iehoshua the son of Iehozadak
the high priest, &amp; to the residue of the people, saying, who is
left among you that saw this house in hir first glory, and
how doe you see it now? is not this house in your eies, in com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parison
of it, as nothing?</hi> the prophet would haue all
mens eies turned to the veiw of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, every sort
brought to the consideration of their present state.
This is no place to shew what dutie <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> or <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoshua</hi>
doth owe vnto God in this respect. They haue
I doubt not such as put them hereof in remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
I aske of you which are a part of the residue of Gods
elect &amp; chosen people. Who is their amongst you
that hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a survey of the house of God, as it was
in the daies of the blessed Apostles of Iesus Christ?
who is there amongst you that hath seen &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidred
this holy temple in her first glory? &amp; how do you see
it now? Is it not in comparison of the other almost as
nothing whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye look vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
charge of your soules, &amp; know how far these are for
the most part growne out of kind, how few there be
that tread the steps of their ancient predecessors, yee
are easily filled with indignation, easily drawne vnto
these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints, wherein the difference of present fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
former times is bewailed, easily persuaded to think of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that lived to enioy the daies which now are gon.
Surely they were happy in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison of vs that haue
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4395:33"/>
succeeded them: were not their Bishops me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnreprovable,
wis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, righteous, holy, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perat, wel reported of even of those
which were without? were not their Pastours, guids, &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
able &amp; willing to exhort with wholso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e doctrine &amp; to
improue which gainesaid the truth? had they priests made
of the refuse of the people? were men, like to the children
which were in <hi>Niniveh,</hi> vnable to discerne betweene the
right hand &amp; the left; presented to the charge of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation?
did their teachers leaue their flocks over which
the holy Ghost had made them overseers? Did their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
enter vpon holy things as spoils, without a reverend
calling? were their leaders so vnkindly affected towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that they could find in their hearts of sel them as sheepe or
oxen, not caring how they made them away? But beloued,
deceaue not your selues. Doe the faults of your guids and
pastours offeud you? it is your fault if they bee thus faulty.
<hi>Nullus qui malu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rectore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> patitur, eu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accuset, quia fuifuit meriti

<hi>O yee disobedient children; turn again,</hi> saith the Lord,

               <hi>which

way to repaire all ruines, breaches, &amp; offensiue decaies in
others, is to begin reformation at your selues. Which that
we may all sincerely, seriously, and speedily doe, God the
Father grant for his sonne our Saviour lesus sake, vnto
whom with the holy Ghost, three persons, one Eternall and

<hi>Amen.</hi>
