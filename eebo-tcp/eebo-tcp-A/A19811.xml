            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MADAME:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis Poëm of our last Ciuile Warres of <hi>England,</hi> (whereof the many Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shewe what kinde of intertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it hath had with the world) I haue now againe sent-forth, with the addition of two bookes: the one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the course of the Historie; the other, making-vp a part, which (for haste) was left vnfurnisht in the former Impressions. And, hauing nothing else to doo with my life, but to worke whil'st I haue it; I held it my part, to adorne (the best I could) this Prouince, Nature hath allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to my Charge: and which I desire to leaue, after my death, in the best forme I may; seeing I can erect no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pillars to sustaine my memorie, but my lines, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise pay my debts and the recknings of my gratitude to their honour who haue donne me good, and furthered this Worke.</p>
            <p>And, whereas this Argument was long since vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:9754:5"/>
(in a time which was not so well secur'd of the future, as God be blessed now it is) with a purpose, to shewe the deformities of Ciuile Dissension, and the miserable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents of Rebellions, Conspiracies, and bloudy Reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which followed (as in a circle) vpon that breach of the due course of Succession, by the Vsurpation of <hi>Hen. 4;</hi> and thereby to make the blessings of Peace, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of an established Gouernment (in a direct Line) the better to appeare: I trust I shall doo a gratefull worke to my Countrie, to continue the same, vnto the glorious Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Hen. 7</hi>: from whence is descended our present Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</p>
            <p>In which worke, I haue carefully followed that truth which is deliuered in the Historie; without adding to, or subtracting from, the general receiu'd opinion of things as we finde them in our common Annalles: holding it an impietie, to violate that publike Testimonie we haue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more euident proofe; or to introduce fictions of our owne imagination, in things of this nature. <hi>Famae rerum standum est.</hi> Though I knowe, in these publike actions, there are euer popular bruites, and opinions, which run ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time &amp; the biass of mens affections: and it is the part of an Historian, to recite them, not to rule the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; especially, otherwise then the circumstances may induce: according to that modest saying; <hi>Nec affirmare sustinco de quibus dubito, nec subducere quae accepi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I haue onely vsed that poeticall licence, of framing speaches to the persons of men according to their occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as <hi>C. Salustius,</hi> and <hi>T. Liuius</hi> (though Writers in Prose, yet in that kinde Poets) haue, with diuers other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and modern Writers, done before me. Wherein, though
<pb facs="tcp:9754:5"/>
they haue incroched vpon others rights, and vsurpt a part that was not properly theirs: yet, seeing they hold so iust a proportion, with the nature of men, and the course of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres; they passe as the partes of the Actor (not the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) and are receiu'd with great approbation.</p>
            <p>And although many of these Images are drawne with the pencil of mine owne conceiuing: yet I knowe, they are according to the portraiture of Nature; and carrie a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance to the life of Action, and their complexions whom they represent. For, I see, Ambition, Faction, and Affections, speake euer one Language, weare like colours (though in seuerall fashions) feed, and are fed with the same nutriments; and only vary but in time.</p>
            <p>Man is a creature of the same dimension he was: and how great and eminent foeuer hee bee, his measure and height is easie to be taken. And all these great actions are openly presented on the Stage of the World: where, there are euer <hi>Spectators,</hi> who will iudge and censure how men personate those parts, which they are set to perform; and so enter them in the Records of Memorie.</p>
            <p>And if I haue erred somewhat in the draught of the young Q. <hi>Isabel</hi> (wife to <hi>Ric. 2.</hi>) in not suting her passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to her yeares: I must craue fauour of my credulous Readers; and hope, the young Ladies of <hi>England</hi> (who peraduenture will thinke themselues of age sufficient, at <hi>14</hi> yeares, to haue a feeling of their owne estates) will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse me in that point. For the rest, setting-aside those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, proper to this kinde of Writing; I haue faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obserued the Historie. Wherein, such as loue this Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of words, may finde, that a Subiect, of the greatest grauitie, will be aptly exprest: howsoeuer others (seeing
<pb facs="tcp:9754:6"/>
in what sort Verse hath beene idly abused) hold it but as a language fitting Lightnes and Vanitie.</p>
            <p>For mine owne part, I am not so far in love with this forme of Writing (nor haue I sworne Fealtie onely to Ryme) but that I may serue in any other state of Inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with what weapon of vtterance I will: and, so it may make good my minde, I care not. For, I see, Iudgement and Discretion (with whatsoeuer is worthy) carry their owne Ornaments, and are grac't with their owne beauties; be they apparayled in what fashion they will. And because I finde the common tongue of the world is Prose; I purpose in that kinde to write the Historie of <hi>England,</hi> from the Conquest: being incouraged thereunto, by many noble &amp; worthy Spirits. Although Madame, I must not neglect to prosecute the other part of this Worke; being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued by your Goodnes: to whome, and to whose Noble Family, I hold my selfe euer bound; and will labour to doo you all the honor, and service I can.</p>
