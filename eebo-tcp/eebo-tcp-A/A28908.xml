            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Faithful and Diligent SERVANT OF THE LORD, Bleſſed at the COMING OF HIS LORD.</p>

            <p>IT would be an indecorum, as cuſtom now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, to ſend abroad a diſcourſe, without direction where it may ſeek its entertainment: whether this be to be imputed to the great unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Readers, or to the unreaſonable multitude of Writers, it concerns me very little to enquire, and thee as little to know. To them I ſend it, who I hope intended honeſtly, when they deſired this plain diſcourſe might be publiſh'd; and though perhaps it might be weakneſs in me to let your deſires have this effect on me, yet it is no fault to wiſh it may, and to hope it will do thee good. It was a plain diſcourſe in my mouth, and it was needful it ſhould be ſo; and it is plain now in paper and Ink, becauſe I was deſir'd to publiſh what I preach'd: if it be ſomewhat more conciſe, it is not without reaſon (ſomewhat being proper enough to the Hearers, which might be leſs proper to Readers, who knew not thoſe circumſtances the Hearers were acquainted with). And you need quarrel the brevity of it no ſooner than you find you were at
<pb facs="tcp:48378:3"/>
the end of it before you were willing. I am ſure I had an excellent pattern of fidelity and diligence in Gods Family, when I had his life in my eye, whoſe death was occaſion of this diſcourſe; I will not praeoccupate your Judgment, whether I have well commended the Duty to you, or encouraged you to the performance of it. I pray of you a ſerious and heedful Reading: and I pray to God that he would give you ſuch a heart as he requireth, ſuch a life of holy care to ſave your ſelves and others, that God may give you the bleſſedneſs of faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in life, at death, to eternity. That this may contribute to all theſe, prayeth,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Think I need not give a Reaſon of my choice of this Text, when I have told you the occaſion of the words: If you will look into the Context, you will ſoon ſee how great agreement there is in it, to this mournful occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and that there was ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I ſhould fix here, where the beſt encouragement of faithful Servants is laid before us, and an example of ſuch an one is to be treated by us. Nor ſhall I need other reaſon to perſwade you to attend to what ſhall be ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Our bleſſed Lord, having exhorted his hearers to a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and watchfulneſs, which becometh Servants whoſe Lord will certainly come, though they know not when, <hi>ver.</hi> 35, 36. And having encouraged them with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of bleſſedneſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 37, 38, in caſe they do attend diligently to this Duty, and perſevere in it unto his coming; and withall, propoſing it in ſo comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive a manner, that it did not appear whether it were ſpoken to all equally, or to ſome more than unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> either out of deſire to know his Duty, or out of curioſity to know his Lords mind, doth (as in ſome other caſes he did) make the enquiry, <hi>ver.</hi> 42, whether the Parable were ſpoken unto all, or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48378:4"/>
only to the Diſciples and Apoſtles, <hi>Lord, ſpeakeſt thou this unto us, or even unto all?</hi> unto which query, Chriſt gives ſuch an anſwer as doth more cloſely bind our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on us, and awakeneth all concerned in it, to ſee to it that they do their duty, be ready for their account, and wait for their bleſſedneſs; <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Who then is that faithful and wiſe Steward,</hi> &amp;c? Chriſt ſeems to have anſwered with a check to his curioſity, but with a direction to his and our willingneſs to our Duty; as if Chriſt had plainly told him, I ſpeak to as many as hope to be bleſſed by their Lord when he cometh, excluding none who pretend to the relation of Servants to the Lord, or to the hoped reward; who ſo would be found faithful in his work, and bleſſed for it; who ſo is either Servant or Steward, to him I ſpeak; and according to the proportion of the Talents and Truſt, I do adviſe to diligence and fidelity in their employs, and aſſure of bleſſedneſs to their fidelity. Be then your condition what it will, whether higher or lower in your Lords Family, if you are in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition faithful, and wiſe, and helpful to your fellow-Servants, and ſo continue to be till your Lord ſhall come, you are and ſhall be bleſſed.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant, whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words I ſhall, with your leave, briefly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe: [<hi>Bleſſed</hi>], we ſo expreſs a good, comfortable, and deſirable ſtate: It is well with him that is bleſſed; and he is thus well, who is thus well doing, and found in it. [<hi>Is that Servant, whom,</hi> &amp;c.] This noteth the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of it, extending to all, and yet pointeth out the perſons, who are here put under the Character of bleſſedneſs; That Servant, though no more; That Steward or Ruler, if ſo much, is the perſon Chriſt ſpeaks of, who ſhall be bleſſed, when <hi>his Lord,</hi> who hath authority
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48378:4"/>
and right to require and direct our obedience, who hath right of calling us to account, and of diſtributing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; when Chriſt ſhall come, then they who ſerved him faithfully, ſhall be bleſſed, and in a good condition.</p>
            <p>[<hi>When he cometh</hi>] which referreth both to the time when, and to the manner how he cometh; at what time ſoever, or in what manner ſoever our Lord ſhall come, all his faithful ſervants ſhall be bleſſed, for they are found [<hi>ſo doing</hi>]; which you muſt refer, partly to what was ſpoken more remotely in the Parable, and concerneth all according to the capacity in which they are, Servants in the Family; and partly to what was ſpoken in the foregoing verſe, where Stewards and Rulers in the Family, giving to the Family its portion of meat in ſeaſon, are deſcribed, and ſuppoſed to be found faithful and wiſe in this charge; and theſe are they who are ſo expreſly pronounced happy in their ſo doing. Briefly, this <hi>ſo doing,</hi> is doing the office of our places, and doing it according to the Rule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, wiſely, faithfully and diligently. The words thus opened, do lay in open view before us, 1. <hi>A Lord who will ſometime or other certainly come</hi> to ſee what his Servants are in their ſeveral places doing. 2. <hi>A bleſſedneſs or happy condition of ſome</hi> of thoſe Servants. 3. <hi>The Character of thoſe who ſhall be happy,</hi> which Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is made up of the particulars mentioned diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>ver.</hi> 42, and ſumm'd up in the Text in <hi>ſo doing.</hi> Hence then paſſing by other particulars, I commend to your attention this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That whenſoever, and however our Lord ſhall come, all his Servants, eſpecially his Stewards, who have been wiſe, faithful, and diligent in his family, giving to all their portion in ſeaſon, ſhall be found in a good and happy ſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not certain when or how our Lord will come;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48378:5"/>
but whenever it is, or however it may be, they are Servants and Stewards in happy ſtate who are found fit for, and faithful in the Lords Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His condition is and ſhall be good, who is a good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the Great and good God.</hi> The meaneſt, and moſt ordinary Servants in the family being faithful, are bleſſed according to their capacities; the Stewards who are above ordinary Servants in their charge, abilities, and account, are alſo above them in their bleſſedneſs, when they are found faithful to their Lord. <hi>It is a good, and a great imployment to be a Servant: It is a better and greater thing to be a Steward in Gods Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Church of Chriſt. It is the beſt temper to be wiſe and faithful in diſcharge of either, as our Lord ſhall appoint to us and require of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in handling this Doctrine, that I may ſpeak fully to it, I ſhall deſire you with me to conſider,

            <p n="2">2. <hi>That our Lords coming is according to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined purpoſe</hi>: Our times for life and ſervice are in Gods hand; they are reſerved with him, and he will come in his own time. Were our times in other hands, we might be unſeaſonably hurried too ſoon out of Life and Labour, by unkind hands of ill-willers; or detained too long by the unwillingneſs of our Friends to part with us.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>There can no meaſures be given beforehand, what time our Lord will take to come to us in.</hi> Nor may we expect any ſuch Rules from any by which to gueſs how long it will be ere our Lord will come to you, or me; Thouſands have within our time and obſervation (if we had heeded it) been ſummoned, when all about them have thought they might have continued much longer. Parents have loſt their Children, Wives have loſt their Husbands, and People have been deprived of their Paſtors on a ſudden, when no ſuch calamity was fear'd. Our Lord hath not made an hour to come ſure to any of us, or inveſted us with a Right to another ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding moment. Our rule is, <hi>Work now,</hi> attend on the preſent buſineſs God lays before us, for our <hi>Lord comes

                  </gap>s coming.</note>2. <hi>Gen.</hi> There are five ſeveral ways wherein the Lord is pleas'd to come toward us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He cometh in publick afflictions, and general cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities upon Kingdoms, or Nations, or People, among which many of his faithful ſervants dwell, and are with others oftentimes involved in their troubles and ſorrows:</hi> When the Lord did call (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50) his Saints together, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, he tells us <hi>a fire ſhall devour before him</hi>; and this is the effect when God ſhall come, and not keep ſilence. Of ſuch a coming <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaketh in theſe words, <hi>The Lord ſhall come out of his place to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth,</hi> Iſa. 26.21. The faithful Servants of God inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the earth with others, may thus feel the caſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory indignation of their Father. And in his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick lofty ſtrains, the ſame Prophet doth lively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe this coming of the Lord, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 verſes, Who is repreſented coming with the <hi>weapons of his indignation,</hi> verſ. 5, <hi>And the day of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction cometh,</hi> verſ. 6, <hi>To lay the land deſolate,</hi> verſ. 9, which was indeed accompliſht in its time on <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Jews after they had rejected Chriſt, and crucified him; yet then at this coming, thoſe that were faithful, were found in a good Condition; they were bleſſed who
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48378:6"/>
ſerved the Lord, and prepar'd for his coming; though this be not the coming chiefly meant in the Text, yet the Doctrine is ſound in this regard.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sometime the Lord cometh in that manner, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular families or perſons are found out by the rod and corrections.</hi> Lev. 20.5, God ſpeaks of cutting off a houſe or perſon. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29, 18, 19. God warneth perſons in a Family, and the Family too; now if ſuch do not take warning, but provoke him, he will in his own time come to correct or puniſh ſuch a perſon or family: of this manner of proceeding are we to underſtand that of 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30, 31, and <hi>cap.</hi> 3.13. When God doth thus viſit perſons, or families, he is properly enough ſaid to come againſt them, and <hi>in ſuch caſes</hi> ſtill it holdeth true, <hi>Thoſe ſervants of God who are faithful in their ſervice to God, are bleſſed, or in a good condition.</hi> So <hi>Eli</hi> was, though he ſmarted under the Rod; and <hi>David</hi> comforted himſelf in the proſpect hereof, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5, <hi>though his houſe ſhould not grow</hi>; though ſevere corrections and rebukes ſhould cauſe the Beauty of his houſe to wither; yet God would give him the Covenant-ſalvation, it ſhould be well with him, in caſe of ſuch coming: though the Text leſs intend it, the Doctrine is both true and uſeful.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Sometime the Lord cometh to ſearch and try mens ſtate, and conſcience is awakened to make enquiry, and to diſcover them to themſelves.</hi> While God ſtands as at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, men are ſecure; but when he cometh by his Word and Spirit, and commands an admiſſion, he ſets up that light within the mans ſoul that diſcovers what he hath done, what he may expect, and what he farther muſt do. <hi>The word is ſharp as a two-edged ſword, and ſearcheth the reins,</hi> Heb. 4.12. And thus the ſecrets of mens hearts are diſcovered, when God cometh with his word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25, among men. When <hi>God heweth men by his prophets,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48378:7"/>
and maketh his judgments as the light,</hi> Hoſ. 6.5, then he cometh into the heart and conſcience. Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Faithful and Diligent are in a good condition, when their hearts do not condemn them, when they know God will not condemn them. But oh the ſad condition of thoſe that dare not look themſelves in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves! that are ſelf-condemned, and afraid to know what God diſcovereth at ſuch coming! The Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> who did not obey the Command of the Lord, could not endure the Prophets, or their word. But <hi>Joſiah</hi> who was faithful to God, can bear ſuch a ſearching word, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.19. &amp; 27. <hi>ver.</hi> Who deſire to be faithful to God, they dare abide this coming; it doth diſcover their ſincerity, and declare them happy. In this caſe (though not directly intended by the Text) it holdeth true, All Gods faithful Servants and Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards are found in a good and happy ſtate. But next, which is that coming intended chiefly in the words and Doctrine:</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>When Death is the Meſſenger God ſendeth to let us know he is coming to us, when he fetcheth us from amidst men, and cometh to take account of each of us</hi>; each man by man, thus viſited, is either more or leſs happy, as he is found more or leſs faithful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent at this coming of the Lord; this is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of which by concurrent vote of our Interpreters the Text doth ſpeak, as alſo doth its Parallels, <hi>Matt.</hi> 24. <hi>ver.</hi> 42, 43. and <hi>Mark</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 34, 35, 36. of which I ſay the leſs, becauſe it paſſing with ſo general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, needs not much proof. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, <hi>The Lord cometh in his Glory and Majeſty to raiſe the dead, and to Judg all men.</hi> They who now do, ſhall not eternally ſleep in the duſt; God will come and call them out of their beds: <hi>The Lord Jeſus will deſcend with the voice of the Trump,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48378:7"/>
and the dead ſhall hear and riſe, to the great, general and laſt judgment.</hi> Thus <hi>he cometh to judg the world</hi> (Pſal. 96.13, and 98.9,) <hi>with righteouſneſs, and the people with equity.</hi> Places that, ſpeaking of the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> do include this Royal procedure which ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate his miniſterial Government. When he cometh (as <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7,) <hi>in view of every eye, for every eye ſhall ſee him when he thus cometh</hi>; or as 'tis deſcribed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23, 24, 25, At this coming the Faithful diligent Servant is in good ſtate. Briefly then, <hi>Whether our Lord come ſooner or later to try the heart by his word, or families by his Rod, or Nations, as he did try the Jews by more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick calamities; In theſe caſes the moſt faithful of his Servants and Stewards are in the most ſafe and bleſſed ſtate; but when he cometh as the judg of all men to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular judgment, calling each man by death; and to the general judgment, calling all men before him; He, and he only is in a good and bleſſed ſtate, who is found to have been faithful and diligent in his Stewardſhip and Service within the Houſe and Family of God, giving to each what portion of meat is due to them.</hi> Which is</p>
            <p>In the third place now to be proved by the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Teſtimony of the Scriptures.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>3. Gen.</hi> Proofs of the Doctrine.</note> Where we find all faithful and diligent Servants, and Stewards eſpecially, pronounced bleſſed and happy in their attendance to the work of doing good to all as they are able, and therein ſerving their Lord, and waiting for his coming. So <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which dye in the Lord:</hi> Death is the greateſt, as well as laſt Enemy to our life; yet if that natural life be ſpent for the Lord, and we dye in him, we are bleſſed; for ſuch mens Works do follow them, and they reſt from their Labours. Now certainly leſſer troubles, and lighter afflictions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not render him or her unhappy, whom Death found and left in a bleſſed ſtate; ſo that to work thoſe works
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48378:8"/>
which we would have to follow us, and to dye in the Lord, as they prove our Fidelity, ſo they do prove our Felicity, and at once prove us good Chriſtians, and in good ſtate. Again, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34, 35, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my father, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are ſuch who fed, cloathed, harboured, viſited, and refreſhed thoſe in the Lords Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, though the leaſt of his Family, <hi>verſ.</hi> 40, which was as much a Duty to them who could do it, as it was uſeful to others for whom it was done: Now they are declared happy ones, who had thus, according to their opportunity Miniſtred unto others. And much more will they appear bleſſed, who have faithfully directed thirſty Souls to the Fountain of living Waters, hungry Souls to the Bread of Life, naked Souls to the white Robes, wandring Souls to the reſt of Souls. Again, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21, <hi>Not he that ſaith, Lord, Lord, but he that doth the Will of my heavenly Father, &amp;c.</hi> not a fruitleſs profeſſion, but a faithful obedience; not an unactive complement, but a diligent fulfilling the Will of our Lord, is at laſt a bleſſing to us; he is in a good ſtate indeed, whoſe Lord doth reward his Service with an entrance into, and enjoyment of eternal life in Heaven. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can alter it to him, who altereth not his courſe of Faithfulneſs and Diligence. Such an one is (<hi>Jam.</hi> 1.22,) <hi>Bleſſed in his deed</hi>: now who is bleſſed in doing his work, can never be in ill-ſtate whilſt he is doing it; and he is in better ſtate when the work done is rewarded: <hi>whoſe work is his happineſs, cannot but be happy, whilſt he attends his work</hi>; and this is the caſe of all diligent and ſincere obſervers of Gods Commandments,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.11.</note> 
               <hi>The keeping them is a great reward.</hi> Chriſtians conſider it, if <hi>glory, honour, immortality, and eternal life,</hi> can be a bleſſedneſs to us, we are aſſured of this, <hi>For every ſoul that doth good</hi> (as God requireth) <hi>whether Jew or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi> Rom. 2.13. <hi>There is a crown of righteouſneſs</hi> (2 Tim.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48378:8"/>
4.8. for St. <hi>Paul</hi> who had fought a good fight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, but if it were limited to his perſon, none could rejoyce herein with aſſurance for themſelves; or were it limited to his excellent qualifications, and unparallel'd diligence, few or none of us could argue our own right hereby; therefore it is added, <hi>not for me only, but for all that love his appearing.</hi> It is then unqueſtionable, that when the Lord ſhall come by Death and particular Judgment to any of us; and when he ſhall come in the general Judgment to us all, every faithful and diligent Servant ſhall be bleſſed. And the bleſſedneſs of that future ſtate, will as much make and keep every ſtate here in our way to it, good and happy, as gains of thouſands yearly will make and keep him rich who loſeth ſome farthings or pence now and then. Thus in general, the common and ordinary Servants find their diligence and fidelity to be their happineſs; <hi>Stewards and Miniſters of the grace of God find it much more their happineſs to have been faithful and diligent.</hi> So the Holy Ghoſt ſeems to ſpeak for encouragement to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Smyrna, Rev.</hi> 2.10. And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1, <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel</hi> are mentioned, <hi>who did handle the word of God faithfully, and commended themſelves to the conſciences of men,</hi> verſ. 2. <hi>Who did preach not themſelves, but Chriſt,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>Who were troubled on every ſide,</hi> verſ. 8. Of theſe it is ſaid, that <hi>light and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary afflictions work for them a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal weight of glory,</hi> verſ. 17, 18. The ſhare Miniſters ſhall have in anſwer to the diligence and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their Labours, ſhall be greater than the ſhare of common or ordinary Chriſtians at the coming of him who is Lord to them all. When each Believer hath his Crown, and all their joys are full, then are thoſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers an acceſſion to the glory and joy of their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diligent Miniſters, who labour'd for their Converſion, and helped forward their final and eternal ſalvation,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48378:9"/>
1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. And once for all, that of <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3, <hi>Who turn many to righteouſneſs, ſhall ſhine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the firmament, &amp;c.</hi> Each faithful Miniſter ſhall have his <hi>Aureola,</hi> golden Ornament added to his Crown: though all the faithful Servants of the Lord ſhall be as the ſtars, yet one ſtar differeth from another; the moſt bright and glorious will be thoſe who were on earth the ſtars that Chriſt held in his right hand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1.</p>
            <p>Theſe Scriptures, with others, which might be added, do confirm the bleſſed future ſtate of faithful and diligent Servants, and Stewards, who in the Lords family attend to their work, and ſerve the Lord by their affording what help they can to all; and in proportion to their truſt and fidelity, ſhall be their happineſs at Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And in the mean time, in what ever way of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections or judgments the Lord may come to others, and to them while they are among others, and are liable to troubles; yet they ſhall be found bleſſed in publick troubles, bleſſed in private troubles, bleſſed under per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal trials, at death more, in the reſurrection moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, happy, and in good ſtate in all theſe caſes.</p>
            <p>Now wherein this bleſſedneſs conſiſteth, is the fourth propoſed head of our diſcourſe, to which your attention is now deſired, that you may be throughly affected with this undoubted truth, and be brought to a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for fidelity and diligence according to your Talents, and may at laſt have a larger meaſure of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that future bleſſedneſs, which I thus range be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you.</p>

himſelf, or neglect to ſue out a Pardon for his known and unknown infirmities: The good man <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> cap. 13.22, <hi>ſought this pardoning Grace from the greatneſs of Gods mercy, when he reflected upon the great ſervices he had done for God and his Church. David,</hi> the man after Gods own heart, <hi>joins</hi> this <hi>ſuit for Pardon, to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts for guiding in the ways of God,</hi> to which he was fully addicted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.4, 5, 6. and in midſt of troubles he ſueth for the ſame mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. <hi>ver.</hi> 15 16, 17, 18. <hi>When his feet were in the net,</hi> v. 15. <hi>when deſolate,</hi> v. 16. <hi>when troubles were enlarged into diſtreſſes,</hi> v. 17. Then he pray'd that God would forgive all his ſin. So the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Church, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, <hi>prays, and God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he will do it,</hi> ver. 4. And ſo <hi>Micah</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 18.19. Now this maketh any condition good and ſafe: <hi>The man whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven,</hi> Pſal. 32. ver. 1, <hi>is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place and in every condition a ſafe and happy man.</hi> God who pitieth infirmities, pardoneth them where he finds ſincerity in his Servants. He that faithfully warns another, and calls on him to repent, and ſeek his Pardon; he that faithfully endeavours to engage others to do their Duty, and ſeek for mercy, is a man whom God hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, ſo as to enſure the bleſſedneſs for himſelf which he perſwades others to look after. Parents, Husbands, Wives, Friends and Miniſters, who heartily deſire and labour to get others into the ſervice of God, on terms and encouragements ſufficient to prevail with them, are indeed the perſons whom we muſt in charity believe are pardoned. I ſhould think he were pardoned who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Grace of his Prince, who perſwaded to all due Allegiance for future, and urged his fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſue for Pardon of what had been ill and unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done already. It is certain the faithful are forgiven and bleſſed therein, though perhaps they have not ſenſe of it, or we evidences to prove it of them. Now no condition
<pb facs="tcp:48378:10"/>
can come on ſuch a man, to render him miſerable or in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The bleſſedneſs of ſuch faithful and diligent ones does lie in that gracious acceptance which God doth afford to them for all their ſincere and willing obedience,</hi> though imperfect in it ſelf, unſucceſsful to others, and altogether unprofitable to God. It is a bleſſed thing <hi>to be accepted with God</hi>; this is <hi>Heaven upon Earth</hi>; this is <hi>Heaven af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we leave Earth.</hi> The Lord rejecteth none that he hath fitted for, and who are faithful in his charge: This was a bleſſing that <hi>David</hi> intreated of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.14, <hi>Let the meditations of my heart, and the words of my mouth be acceptable in thy ſight,</hi> &amp;c. This gracious acceptance did in <hi>Davids</hi> troubles counter-balance the grieviouſneſs of his troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8, with <hi>ver.</hi> 13. He could bear the reproach of enemies, when he knew his prayer ſhould be acceptable unto his God. No Courtier deſpis'd by Rebels is ſo happy in his Prince's Favour, and free acceſs to his Prince's Perſon, as ſuch diligent and faithful Servants are in their acceſs to, and acceptance with their God. You may gueſs at what I ſay by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment <hi>Cain</hi> (of men one of the worſt) had of Gods refuſing to accept him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. It caſt him down, and fill'd him with trouble. <hi>No condition is uneaſy to a ſoul that enjoys Gods Favour; for it is better than life,</hi> Pſal. 63. ver. 3. and every condition is dark and doleful without his favour. What is Hell, but a place where hopeleſs Souls are under the inconceivable Tortures of an eternal rejection and ſeparation from God? What is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but a glorious, free, full and eternal ſtate of nearneſs to God, and of favour with him? This acceptance is the great bleſſing God hath promiſed to ſuch as ſerve and love him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.7. <hi>It is the ſum of all we obtain through Chriſt, in whom we are accepted with God,</hi> Eph. 1. ver. 6. Matt. 25. ver. 21, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant,</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:48378:10"/>
enough to make us bleſſed now; <hi>enter thou into the joy of thy Maſter</hi> is fulneſs of the future bleſſedneſs. In every ſtate, and at the coming of the Lord, thus bleſſed is the good Servant.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This Bleſſedneſs of the faithful and good Servant, doth lie partly in the peace and tranquility of his mind, perſwaded that now ſin is pardoned and his duties are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: every condition ſhall at laſt give place to what is beſt, and all ſhall work together for good to him</hi>; though va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious troubles do toſs him, yet they (like rowling waves) carry the Ship toward the Harbour. It is well with him, becauſe he knoweth the knife which lanceth him, doth not make him a Sacrifice under avenging Juſtice. And though he is corrected, yet it is under the hand of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is not deſtroyed by the hand of an Executioner. He is ſatisfied <hi>that it is good for him that he hath been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,</hi> Pſal. 119. ver. 67, 71, 75. When he ſuffers with others, he ſeeth he needed it; ſo all appears ſeaſonable, neceſſary and profitable to him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, <hi>We are in heavineſs for a ſeaſon if need be, and for our profit,</hi> Heb. 12. ver. 10. It is bleſſed to be refined, and God doth by his coming intend this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. <hi>ver.</hi> 10, <hi>That he may chuſe them before others.</hi> Now this conſidered, the faithful Servants of God do account their condition good, for that it is always tending to, and ſhall at laſt end in what is beſt for them: It is on the increaſe towards full happineſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The faithful and good Servants happineſs doth partly conſiſt in that ſupport which his Lord giveth to him under his burthens; while he ſubmits to the will of his Lord waits for him, and doth his Duty, he is ſupported by the preſence of his Lord:</hi> He ſinketh not, becauſe the Lord uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18. When <hi>Davids</hi> feet did well nigh ſlip, the Lords mercy held him up. It is an unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able variety of helps that God affordeth to his faithful

ones, they are very ſecret, unexpected, ſtrong and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, many times beyond the belief of ſtrangers, and the hope of thoſe who receive them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2, <hi>In midſt of Rivers and waters, in midſt of fire and flames</hi>; if God promiſe to be with us, we may account our condition good and ſafe; for his preſence ſhall ſave us from Rivers, that they do not overflow us, and from Fire, that it kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not on us. Now thus ſafe and good is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every faithful Servant of God, he is pardoned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, bettered, and ſupported ſtill, The <hi>Angel of Gods preſence is with him, and ſaveth him,</hi> Iſa. 63. ver. 9. He is bleſſed whom God will ſave, whom God will ſupport. It is ſad to be left ſinking under our burthens; but to be ſupported under them, is next to a bleſſed freedom from them, or next to a life above them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>However, it may be death ſhall be the ſad conſequence of a faithful and diligent Servants ſufferings with others; yet he is in this caſe bleſſed too: For he might die in peace and joy; he doth at leaſt die in ſafety, and free from danger of future evils.</hi> It is poſſible a good Servant may die under fears, but he doth not die under danger of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; <hi>Who walk in their integrity, enter into their Reſt,</hi> Iſa. 57. ver. 2. Though Death be an enemy, it is laſt to a child of God: Stewards and Servants though faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diligent, yet they muſt die; but after death there is no other enemy, all is then ſafe to them: they paſs by Death to the enjoyment of the love of their Lord, to be filled with that love which is inconceivable, and poſſeſs that love which is eternal; from which, <hi>Nothing can ever ſeparate them,</hi> Rom. 8. ver. 37, 38. <hi>thus death is theirs,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. ver. 22. Now that is a bleſſed ſtate indeed which is ſo full of ſafety: How do dying men acknowledg this! when Death brings no danger with it, we are happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: This <hi>Balaam</hi> wiſh'd for, though he never attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. The untruſty and ſlothful Servant is unhappy in
<pb facs="tcp:48378:11"/>
his death, becauſe he dyeth under greateſt danger, he dyeth an evil and wicked Servant; the good Servant dyeth as ſafe as he can wiſh, and as happy as he can be made. Which will appear in the</p>
            <p>Sixth thing, wherein the bleſſed ſtate of ſuch doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt: <hi>They paſs after death immediately into an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable glory, where their ſouls purifi'd from all ſin, and made perfectly holy, enjoy a bleſſed, though not a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated glory</hi>: they are <hi>in the joys of their maſter</hi>; they live in the ſight of their glorifi'd redeemer, triumph over ſin and temptation; aſſured of the future reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their bodies, without tediouſneſs of a delay wait for it; <hi>they poſſeſs their building of God, their houſe not made with hands, which is eternal in the heavens,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1. <hi>They are before the throne,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. Thus bleſſed in life, in death, after death, are the faithful Servants of the Lord. And yet, this is not all, there is</p>
            <p>A ſeventh thing, part of their bleſſedneſs, which, when their Lord cometh, they ſhall enjoy, <hi>that is the reſurrection of their bodies in a glorious conformity to the glorifi'd body of their redeemer.</hi> When the Lord of theſe Servants and Stewards we ſpeak of, ſhall come and awaken all out of their beds of duſt; His good Servants, whoſe bodies were ſown in diſhonour, ſhall receive their bodies raiſed in honour: thoſe bodies which were ſown mortal and weak, ſhall be raiſed immortal, and in ſtrength, fit to be the eternal habitation of immortal ſouls; and both ſoul and body united, ſhall ever live in a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, regular and ſinleſs harmony and friendſhip. You that admire the unparallel'd beauties of mortal creatures, and judg That their happineſs, which is your envy or wiſh; withdraw your eye, and look to the Grave, whence the rareſt beauties are at laſt to riſe, whence the firmeſt ſtrength, the moſt deſirable activity, and the ſpiritfulleſt
<pb facs="tcp:48378:12"/>
vigor. And then ſay whether you can think them leſs than <hi>bleſſed, who have their part in this Reſurrection,</hi> to allude to that of Saint <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing ſhall ever be able to hinder them from this, which though exceeding great, is yet followed with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part neceſſary to their happineſs; which is,</p>
            <p n="8">8thly, <hi>A publick, ſolemn and full declaration of their abſolution from the charge which men or Devils, in their accuſation of them, would load them with; nay, the charge wherewith the Law would burthen them, ſhall be fully and ſolemnly taken off:</hi> when they ſhall be <hi>juſtified</hi> before men and Angels, <hi>from all that from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes,</hi> Act. 13.38, which ſhall be when our Lord ſhall proceed in Judgment towards all, when according to the order of the Reſurrection, thoſe that are Chriſts, ſhall be firſt called, judged and abſolved; when according to the order of the Parable, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.34, Thoſe ſhall be adjuged to glory firſt, who fed the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, cloathed the naked, took into their houſes thoſe that were ſtrangers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I doubt not, you'l confeſs is a great happineſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: well, when our Lord cometh, thus happy ſhall all his faithful and diligent Servants be, who in life laid out themſelves in labour for the Lord, who in death reſt from their labours, and whoſe labours follow them into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be examined, pardoned and rewarded according to the riches of Grace.</p>
            <p n="9">9thly, Our Lord, when he cometh, will add another thing to their happineſs: <hi>They ſhall then with him, as aſſeſſors and approvers of his righteous proceeding with the reſt of the world, ſit Judges of the world</hi>; of this we are aſſured, <hi>Jude</hi> 14, <hi>The Lord cometh with</hi> (or in midſt of) <hi>ten thouſand of his Saints to Judg,</hi> &amp;c. Of this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks more clearly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2, <hi>The Saints ſhall judg the world</hi>: Nay, more, <hi>we ſhall judg Angels,</hi> ſaith the
<pb facs="tcp:48378:12"/>
Apoſtle. <hi>This honour have all his Saints</hi>; and in this they are bleſſed: and this is enough to make every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition good to them, until the glorious coming of their Lord, until they are thus advanced: In a word, Chriſt ſeems to promiſe to his, who are more than the ordinary Servants in his Family, a more than ordinary degree of this Honour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. <hi>ver.</hi> 28, 29, 30. with <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.28. I will not enquire how far faithful Stewards and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are herein, next to the Apoſtles, concerned: It is well for them, their faithfulneſs to ſouls ſhall then be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted and honoured.</p>
            <p n="10">10thly and laſtly, <hi>Chriſt our Lord, when he cometh in the Glory of his Father Judg of all, will, when the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Judgment is finiſhed, and the wicked world is caſt into Hell, thrown into the place of Torment, where their worm dieth not, where the fire is not quenched; Then Chriſt will take all his faithful ones, and paſs with them into the inconceivable and eternal Glory of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, brought to the fulleſt degree of greatneſs and Majeſty that is foretold to us.</hi> When they ſhall ever be with the Lord, and behold his Glory; when they ſhall be like to him whom they ſee, and be filled with that Glory that ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth on them; when all the Saints of God, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhall be amaſſed into one great and general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and all orderly ranged before the throne of God, and the Lamb miniſtring in ſinleſs praiſes, love and adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ever.</p>
            <p>Now certainly, could you and I lift up our eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this illuſtrious aſſembly; could we view them there, we ſhould ever be ſatisfied, That diligence in, and faithfulneſs to the ſervice of our Lord, according to our capacity, now is, and will, at the coming of our Lord, appear to be as much our comfort and happineſs, as it is our Duty, and ought to be our care. Oh then, let us conſider, <hi>What it is to be acquitted from guilt: What to
<pb facs="tcp:48378:13"/>
be approved and rewarded: What 'tis to be bettered by all providences: What to die in ſafety at laſt: Is not this to be bleſſed? Is not this to die the death of the righteous?</hi> Why Chriſtians, your faithfulneſs and diligence ſhall ſo be found, and ſo end, if you continue it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Do we believe a glory ſucceeds our death, a reſurrection our burial, a publick abſolution our being judged? ſhall we ſit aſſeſſors, approvers, and witneſſes to the Great Judg, and paſs with him into glory everlaſting?</hi> And ſhall not our unwearied diligence and faithfulneſs exerciſed in his Service, prove we believe the truth, and expect this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit hereof? I hope now you will be leſs moved with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent difficulties, and more fixed for future diligence in ſerving the Lord, and doing good to his Family, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed here by giving the Portion of meat in ſeaſon; in which appears the wiſdom and fidelity of Servants and Stewards, and to which bleſſedneſs is annexed and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated in the Text. The Reaſon whereof, is the fifth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral head of diſcourſe, and which we ſhall now briefly touch upon.</p>

               </note>1. <hi>Wiſdom and faithfulneſs in Servants and Stewards, are the beſt qualifications, and compriſe all that a Lord and Maſter requireth, or need require in them:</hi> for wiſdom makes them meet for ſuch a truſt, and faithfulneſs encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth their Lord to truſt them. And both theſe appear in their obſerving what is ſit for each perſon and ſeaſon, and applying to both accordingly. So when Fathers know what is fit for Children, and Maſters know what is fit for Servants, and Miniſters for their people, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly inſtruct, reprove, warn, encourage, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them: Here is both the widom and fidelity requiſite to a good Servant; and <hi>the Lord, who intends in the Text to oblige us to all that good Servants and Stewards ſhould do, hath thus cloſely couched all our Duty in this comprehenſive phraſe.</hi> So the bleſſedneſs is appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
<pb facs="tcp:48378:13"/>
not to a ſingle Duty, but to the univerſal dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent diſcharge of all our Duty; which is ſummed up in this giving to each other our Portion of meat in ſeaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Thus we are ſeaſonably minded of that great and neceſſary duty, which the laſt and worſt age of the world doth neglect</hi>; we are minded of giving mutual help and furtherance to each other in the way of Holineſs and Obedience. Our diſputing, quarrelling, cenſuring, and condemning age, is ready to turn one another out of the way, to diſpute each other out of the truth, and to quarrel each other for doing their duty, inſtead of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other to do it: But this little becomes Servants and Stewards in the ſame Family; this is no part of their wiſdom or fidelity; Chriſt knew we ſhould (unto his coming) need each others help, and hath therefore ſo commended it as our wiſdom and fidelity, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the diſcharge of it by this large reward. Let us then have ſo much reaſon to ſee the excellency of the duty and temper, and ſo much Religion before God, and love to our ſelves, as to get this temper that we may do the duty, and receive the reward, and be at laſt bleſſed with thoſe we helpt towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This giving the portion of meat in ſeaſon: <hi>This charitable benificence, puts a great honour upon Religion, and commends it to others</hi>: And Chriſt doth therefore expect we ſhould thus adorn our Profeſſion; and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth us to it, by ſuch a declaration of the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe who attend this duty. A wiſe, faithful, and diligent Phyſitian credits his Profeſſion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth men, that it is very uſeful and profitable to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. A Chriſtian of ſuch a temper in Chriſtianity, and ſo exerciſing himſelf to do this comprehenſive good in his place, doth as much convince the world, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
<pb facs="tcp:48378:14"/>
is of all Profeſsions moſt uſeful to mankind, who are by it helped forward in the arduous and important affairs of eternity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Thus we are awakened to greater watchfulneſs over our ſelves and others, and minded of obſerving, laying hold on, and improving opportunities; which, though we are ſo engaged not to let ſlip, yet we too too often let fall quite out of our own hands: and that becometh for ever impoſſible to us, which once might have been eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effected by us.</hi> Time is not eaſily redeemed, but opportunities are more difficultly recovered, and for moſt part once ſlipt, and for ever loſt: Well then, might ſuch Emphaſis be laid on this Duty of giving a portion in ſeaſon, that all might be awakened to heed what op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities are in their hand. Oh conſider it, I beſeech you, Parents for your Children, Husbands for your Wives, Maſters for your Servants, elder ones for the younger, and Miniſters for their People; you cannot always live, they muſt dye, and neither can give or receive helps when death ſwallows up your opportunities. You'l never hear him catechiſing, preaching, praying, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting, who now reſts in his grave; and you are not ſure you ſhall ever have ſuch another. How heedful ſhould we be then to receive our portion when offered, and to offer it to others while we may; and be ſo found prepared for the reward which is promiſed to theſe good Servants, but is reſerved until the coming of our Lord: The reaſon of which delay or adjourning of our happineſs is the ſixth General branch of our diſcourſe, and now cometh to be conſidered.

<pb facs="tcp:48378:14"/>
in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> when <hi>Egypt</hi> lay in darkneſs. Heaven is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deſirable, but when the miſery threatned involves the contemners of it, they will appear bleſſed indeed, who ſought it, and obtain'd it. The various coming of our Lord doth ſhew the world the evil ſtate in which the unbelieving and rebellious ſinners are found, and ſo cannot but ſhew the good ſtate in which the faithful are found to be at his coming.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is ſomewhat of Royal prerogative in it: God will have his laſt coming to be the ſeaſon, becauſe it ſeems good to him that it ſhould be ſo.</hi> And this were reaſon enough, though there were no other; he hath reſerved times and ſeaſons in his own hand: and he who gives the reward freely, may (ſurely) chooſe the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he will give it. <hi>That ever he will give, it is grace; that he will give it at laſt, is his pleaſure</hi>; of which none ever complain'd, when they received the bleſsing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is much of Decorum, and due order herein: it would not be ſo ſeaſonable at any other time</hi>; their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is for the Lord their Maſter, and he is the fitteſt to view their Service, and to aſsign their recompence; they did not expect their happineſs before his coming, and yet they profeſſed they ſhould receive it at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and now when times and ſeaſons ſuit their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and declared hopes, there appears a juſt order and harmony between times and things: Now the promiſe, and their hopes are conſonant to each other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>There is ſomewhat of that we call neceſſary in the caſe, their happineſs is reſerved to that time, becauſe it could not be ſooner.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>All the greateſt good Gods Servants can receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this coming of their Lord, is too little and mean to be their bleſſedneſs</hi>; beſides that, moſt of external advantages are the rewards of ſuch as ſhall never have better, and are given to hypocrites, Now 'tis neceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:48378:15"/>
that faithful Servants ſhould ſtay till they may receive a better reward than hypocrites have.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is neceſſary all their work be done, before they receive their full bleſſedneſs; now their work ends not till they dye, then their works follow them, and they are bleſſed.</hi> It is not more neceſſary a Labourer do his work, ere he receive his wages; or a Soldier conquer, ere he triumph; than that the faithful Servants of the Lord do all their work ere they are bleſſed and fully recompenced for it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Full bleſſedneſs of Gods Servants must be in a place and ſtate where all (not one excepted) may meet, and be joynt-heirs of the ſame inheritance.</hi> Now this cannot be in any place or ſtate, but that to which (at the Lords coming) they ſhall be carried. Now we come into the world, live a few days, and in ſmall numbers together, and cannot live all together, nor long together; your tears witneſs it: but we muſt be all gathered together ere all tears ſhall be wiped from all faces, and this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but where our Lord will be with us for ever, which will not, cannot be till his coming.</p>

            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">1. Uſe. <hi>Information</hi>
               </note>1. <hi>Information</hi>: Hence we may learn, 1. <hi>That the care and buſineſs of Chriſtians is as their priviledg, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great:</hi> Happineſs in every condition and ſtate is an exceeding great priviledg; and to be faithful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in the Lords Family, according to our Talents and Relations, is no light and eaſy care, or work; it requires much wiſdom, and much heedfulneſs. I wiſh we were more apprehenſive of both, that our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be faithful might ſomewhat anſwer our hopes to be happy; if you ſeparate them now, God will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate you from them hereafter, when death ſhall cut you off from your opportunities, and Judgment ſhall cut you off from your hopes. Be holy, and ſerve your Lord, as ever you hope to be happy with your Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence learn, <hi>The firſt part of a faithful Servants and Stewards work is the more troubleſome, the laſt
<pb facs="tcp:48378:16"/>
part is moſt ſweet, and ſatisfactory; Sincerity and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence are ſweeteſt at laſt.</hi> The idle revelling Servant is moſt at eaſe when his Maſter is at fartheſt diſtance; but the diligent and faithful Servant doth moſt rejoyce when his work is neareſt an end, his Maſter neareſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his reward neareſt to his hand.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence learn, <hi>That beſt men, though they ſhall be fully bleſſed at laſt, yet that laſt ſhall not be but when the Lord pleaſeth.</hi> None have our times in their hands, to prolong them, or ſhorten them to their humors or paſſions: Good Chriſtians ſhould live too little, and ſerve God and the Church too little, if bad men might meaſure out the time of their ſervice: ſuch men would ſend them to their happineſs ſooner than would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for thoſe that neeed them. And were our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in glory at the diſpoſal of our friends, and ſuch as love us, we ſhould be kept longer from it than we would. It is fit it ſhould, and 'tis beſt that it be in God our gracious Soveraign and Lords hand, to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure out the time of our Service, and to fix the time of our reward, which ſhall be when he cometh; and he will come when he pleaſeth, and never to the loſs of his faithful Servants.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Wiſdom is neceſſary; the verſe before my Text tells us as much, therefore you must get wiſdom from the Scriptures.</hi> Read, conſider and remember them, they are the rule our Lord hath left for direction of his whole Family: <hi>The entrance into theſe, giveth wiſdom,</hi> and this wiſdom will attemper both heart and life, that both may be holy, and the end happy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Settle your reſolutions to do all the known will of your Lord:</hi> Let it be your motive why you do,
<pb facs="tcp:48378:17"/>
and your warrant when you have done the things that are proper to your places and callings. An unreſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved man will never be throughly faithful or diligent: the full purpoſe of your heart muſt be to do all the good to all as you can; which is the will of him who is good to all, and whoſe tender mercies are over all his works.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Whatever advantage you have on men, whether it be advantage of Interest or Authority, uſe it all for God, and the good of their ſouls, who in likelihood will hearken to you, and be adviſed by you:</hi> Perhaps you may thus ſave ſome. Where you may forbid, let not ſin be committed, unforbidden: Where you may command let not good be omitted through want of your Command: uſe the Power God gives you to engage others to ſerve God. <hi>Abraham</hi> would command his Houſe to keep the Covenant of the Lord, ſo do you.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Watch over your ſelves, that you may watch over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and ere you pretend faithfulneſs to others, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and care to make them good, be ſure to be good your ſelves</hi>; none can believe you are in earneſt bent on the good of ſouls, if you neglect your own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Do the good which your places require, and then perſwade others to mind their Duty in their places. Maſters, Fathers, and Teachers will do more hurt by bad examples, than they can do good by beſt Counſels.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Look frequently to the future bleſſedneſs, under the conditions with which it is propoſed to you and others,</hi> in the Text, Context, and other places: <hi>a frequent view of that bleſſedneſs, will heighten your deſires and hopes: A frequent view of the conditions, will awaken your

care, and provoke to diligence, leſt you ſhould come ſhort of your hopes,</hi> and be diſappointed of your beſt deſires. We are apt to forget our hopes, therefore look often to that bleſſedneſs; we are apt to indulge our eaſe and ſloth, therefore look well and often to the terms on which it muſt be expected. Though many weakneſſes are paſſed by and covered, yet wilful negligence and inſincerity will not be paſſed by; you muſt be faithful and ſincere, if you will be happy and bleſſed: <hi>This light is ſown for the upright; and the ſpirit in which is no guile, is, and ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> Pſal. 32.2.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Remember and imitate the beſt examples that fall under your obſervation.</hi> Beſide what are recorded in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, (to which you muſt look) it will be helpful to you, if you will remember and imitate thoſe whoſe life and carriage was much in your eye. And let me tell you, in the Copy our late faithful Brother ſet you, there are remarkable for your imitation. A prudent care to manage ſoul-concerns; a conſtant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied diligence in Labours for their good; an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted reſolution for known duty to God and Man; a tender and meek ſpirit, gently dealing with the weak, yet willing enquirers after God; A ready and full-willing mind to miniſter on every occaſion to the edifying of thoſe he converſed with: An even and ſteddy practice of what he commended as excellent or urged, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty, an acquaintedneſs with the importance of duty and reward. A ſerious mindfulneſs of Death and Judgment, on which he diſcourſed frequently, and lively; dying to the World, but living to God, and ſtill valuing moſt what was ſo good, God would not, and men could not take from him: which appear'd in his deportment and frame of ſpirit, when loſs of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:48378:18"/>
Children, and uncertain riches, raiſed his eſteem and value of the Goſpel, and his and your hopes ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in the Goſpel; a heart full of love, and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for your good; whence thoſe laſt deſires and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in order to the promoting of your good, which I am informed he left you to conſider: <hi>Prize a Guide that will be faithful to your ſouls; keep the unity of the ſpirit into which you are called by the Goſpel; and ſeek God earneſtly for both.</hi> Now could we prevail with you who heard, and with others who read this diſcourſe, to endeavour for ſuch a frame of ſpirit, and to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, I know there would be more faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diligence, and mutual hope among the Servants of the Lord, and his Family would be more beautiful in ſight of others, and more comforted and edified in their own ſouls. Read then, and read again, and be in your houſes (which ſhould be little Families, or Churches of God) in directing, and helping them to Heaven, what he deſired and labour'd to be amongſt you all; I do think he gave you the Copy of Faithfulneſs and Diligence, or I would not have thus ſet it before you; and I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to you as becomes both me and it, <hi>viz.</hi> It is the Copy of one who whilſt he was good, was ſtill a man; but though I could wiſh you would excel him, I will not flatter you with a hope you will do it; Oh that you would equal him, of whom allow me to ſay, He could do as much as moſt of beſt Men, Scholars, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Husbands, Fathers, Brethren, Miniſters; and his will was ever equal to his ability; the Service of his Lord was his life: though he lived not on it, he would not, he could not live without it; by a gracious Maſter ſitted for, ſucceeded in, carried through much work in a little time; and I believe now rewarded with a Crown of Life and Righteouſneſs, which he knew he did not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48378:18"/>
merit, though he knew it ſhould be his wages.</p>
            <p>In brief, he was ſuch an one as friends who knew him, deſire they may be; and now is ſuch as they hope they ſhall be; ſuch an one as ſome enemies already (as I am inform'd) have wiſht they might be, and others will once at laſt wiſh they had been. He had a worth known to himſelf, and others, but it did not puff him up. Should I ſay all I could, ſtrangers would think I exceed, Friends would know a better Orator might juſtifiably have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more. Yet once for all; If either Readers or Hearers carp at the Character I have given him, I have two things to ſay: Firſt it will be eaſier to quarrel at the praiſes, than to deſerve them: Next, I would defraud none of the Commendation due to them; nor do I prefer him above all; there are ſome (but too few) ſuperior in gifts and graces, I hope there are many his equals; I am ſure the moſt are lower by head and ſhoulders, who likelieſt to miſinterpret me, ſhall have a good wiſh for them, or rather a ſerious Prayer, teſtimony of a hearty love to their perſons, and unfeigned deſire of their own good, comfort and welfare; and of all theſe, to theirs, and the Church of God, in this, and after ages; for them I ſay, I will pray more days, fewer troubles, and that they may be in other things altogether ſuch as he was.</p>

            <p>Having thus diſplayed the various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and kinds of thoſe Confederates with the Lower World, we ſhall now enter upon the proofs that the Heathen Prieſts of Old and the Idolatrous Papiſts of later date, have been, and are the Great promoters of this Infernal and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed defection from the Eternal Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48378:22"/>
of happineſs; and the great encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Daemonolatry, as well as Idolatry (that is to ſay of Devil-Worſhip) which is the higheſt Homage he expects from his Infatuated Vaſſals, and on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which he (principally) inſtructs them in the dark and deviliſh Myſteries of Hell-Craft and Faſcination.</p>
            <p>It was alwaies the Cuſtom of the Nations to ſeek unto their Gods for Counſel, in the caſe of War, and other Extremities: and as the holy one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his People to ſeek his face, and call upon his name, and expreſly in the firſt Table forbids the making any ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance or likeneſs of any Image, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in Earth, or in the Waters under the Earth; thereby ſtrictly forbidding all manner of Idolatry: ſo the wicked An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel hath at all times been ſeducing and alienating the hearts of Men from their Obedience to the Righteous Command, by ſetting up falſe Gods. And as the Prophets and Holy Men of God ſpake as they were Inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt; So the Idol Prieſts and Pytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts delivered the Devils Oracles to the People: They were enquired of, and ſought unto, in relation to future events and Contingencies. Nay ſo far had theſe Infernal Prieſts Impoſed upon the Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted

World, that their Daemons, or Familiars for their Deities were no better) obtained Divine Adoration, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not their High-places, Groves, and Altars; ſo this Devil-Worſhip was Promoted under the Notion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their Services abounded with the Oſtentatious Pomps of Deviliſh Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>And as the offering of Bullocks, Lambs, Doves, and ſuch like were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Divine Command to be offered in the time of the Ceremonial Law, when the Prieſt entered into the Holy of Holies, and that not without Blood, as the Apoſtle of the Gentiles notes: So were the Altars of the Ethnic Idols ſteeped in Blood, and that not only of Beaſts; But they Reek't with Humane Gore: So we read that they cauſed their Children to paſs through the fire to that <hi>Canibal Moloch</hi> and often in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of theſe deluded Oriental Nations, we read they Sacrificed ſometimes a Youth, ſometimes a young Damſel, to pacify their Incenſed Deities. In the 18. Chapter of the 1. Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> in that mighty defeat of the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> when they contended with the Prophet of the Lord, in the 28. <hi>verſe</hi> they cut themſelves with Knives, and Lancers,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48378:23"/>
after their manner, 'till the Blood Guſhed out upon them. By which it appears that it was Cuſtomary for thoſe Biggotted Wretches to Implore the aid of their deteſtable Mock-Deities. Nor can any one that reads the Modern Hiſtories of Witch-Craft and Sorceries, be Ignorant, that the Compacts and Confederacies of thoſe deluded ones are confirmed with their Blood, either by making their mark with it on certain Cov'nants drawn between them; or by permitting their Familiar to draw their Blood at thoſe Beſtial Teats (which for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) the <hi>Succubus</hi> draws in the parts of their Bodies.</p>
            <p>What were the <hi>Pythones,</hi> or <hi>Pythonici</hi> ſo much reſorted to of Old? But becauſe by the predictions they uttered by the Aſſiſtance of the Black Angel, they had got the eſtimation of Prophets, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſes. This made King <hi>Saul</hi> in the 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> enquire for one that had a Familiar Spirit, or a <hi>Pythonem</hi> as the Latain tranſlation hath it: And this was it which cauſed the King of <hi>Moab</hi> thrice to ſend his princes and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to the Son of <hi>Behor</hi>; for they had in their hand the reward of Divination, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. So that if they had not believed him to have had ſuch a Familiar
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48378:24"/>
or Spirit, for what reaſon ſhould they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that reward with them? Beſides they apprehended that he had the power of Bleſſing and Curſing, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. As the Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted Papiſts at this day Impute to their <hi>Pythonic</hi> Prieſt the Pope; tho it be the Command of our great High Prieſt to his Diſciples, that they bleſs, and Curſe not. It is farther Obſervable that <hi>Balak</hi> took <hi>Balaam</hi> to the High places of the Idol <hi>Baal,</hi> from one place to another, where they uſed to offer Sacrifices, and Expect the anſwer of their Diabolical Gods, by the mouth of the Prieſt, who uſed to Divine unto the People. They Imputed a great virtue and power to thoſe places where their lying Spirits uſed to Confer with them; therefore when the Prophet could not Curſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> from one of the High Places, the King takes him to another, and to a third, with a peradventure thou mayſt have a power to curſe them from thence: But the Prophet being Commanded by God, was compelled to declare to him, in <hi>chap.</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 23.

And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth many Altars Erected by the <hi>Athenians</hi> to theſe kind of Deities, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which he found one Inſcribed to the unknown God.</p>
            <p>But thoſe to whom the Goſpel of truth hath been Preached have been
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48378:25"/>
taught to believe that there is but one only true God, and therefore may be well aſſured that theſe were evil Spirits, and Diabolical deluſions; and that pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Adoration to their Impious Shrines, or teaching others ſo to do, is a Doctrine of Devils. And that ſuch have been and are ſtill by many Barbarous Nations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged is evidently confirmed by the univerſal agreement of all Hiſtories, Records, and times; and that they were manifeſtly ſeen, known, and familiarly diſcerned by the outward ſenſes; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any Rational and Candid Reader be denyed, haveing been ſo fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Teſtimonies both Divine and Moral.</p>
            <p>In the next place we ſhall Compare the Idolatries of the Roman Church with thoſe of the Ancients, and prove by Natural Conſequence, that Idol Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is a Confederacy with Devils, and a practice neceſſarily promoting that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable ſin of Witch-craft.</p>
            <p>'Tis very true that the Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors (as they call themſelves) affirm that they do not teach Images to be Worſhipped; but certainly when we have enquired into the Doctrines, as well as practices of their Church we ſhall find that ſuch like Evaſions are but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48378:26"/>
Jeſuitical Shams, and pious frauds with which they would wipe off the Odium of their groſs Superſtitions amongſt the Ignorant and Credulous. For their Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, and Fathers generally maintain that Images are to be honoured with the ſame Worſhip that is due to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or Prototype: So that the Images of God, and of the Trinity (for ſuch they are not aſhamed to make, as will be ſeen by and by) and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt muſt be <hi>adored</hi> with the higheſt Divine Worſhip that any Creature is Capable to pay: and if any have come ſhort herein, and have not preached up this exceſs of Devotion, the Conſtant practice of the Popiſh Church runs coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to their Doctrine. They ſet up Images every where in their Churches, and enjoin their People to Worſhip them, and the more they Cringe and Creep, the more devout Catholicks they are accounted.</p>
            <p>And as their Predeceſſors the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> and the Gentile Idolaters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated themſelves, and cryed, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated their Bodies before their Idols; ſo the Popelings bow before their Idols, Pray unto them, ſmoke their Noſtrils with perfumes, and erect abundance of Wax-Lights about them, and in Loud
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48378:26"/>
Quires Chant the Praiſes of their Idol Saint, And when this Rotten God hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to fall into repair, and to be patcht and mended, happy is he that can get one of the Conſecrated Chips, &amp; preſent it to ſome Biggotted Lady, or Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to ſanctify their cloſets. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world that it is certainly the Image that they Worſhip &amp; Adore, and not the Virtues, or Remembrance of the Original, they pay a great deal more Superſtitious homage to a Graven Image than to a painted one, though they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſame Perſon; beſides the ſame Image, hath much more Reverence in one place than in another, as their Lady of <hi>Loretto, and</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> &amp;c. To which you ſhall have them trot a hundred Leagues, or more, in Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, when perhaps they have the Image of the ſame Saint altogether as decent, and as like at home in their own Pariſh Church. But all this can be ſuppoſed for no other but that they might keep cloſe to the Copy of the Heathen Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, who though they had many Groves to <hi>Moloch,</hi> and <hi>Aſtoreth &amp;c.</hi> Yet they had their Capital high places; where (in caſe the Petit Country Deities could not give them redreſs) they appealed as to a higher Court, and with vaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48378:27"/>
and Chargeable Pilgrimages ſought to obtain an anſwer to their Petitions. So the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos</hi> had more veneration than any other of his Shrines, though many others were ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to him; But however it happen'd, other Climates did not ſo well ſuit with the Temper, or Conſtitution of that Deity; perhaps they might be too cold, or hot, the catering of the Scullion Prieſts, not ſo agreeable to his Pallate as the Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Ragouſts and entertainments: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it was, the God was more ſullen, and ſeemed to be tongue-tyed in other places, or ſpoke in ſome Language which the Prieſt did not underſtand; whereas thoſe at <hi>Delphos</hi> ſoon reſolved the doubts, and anſwered the Petitions of their Suppliants.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Nants</hi> and <hi>Tours,</hi> and ſome other places they erected a Monſtrous Image to our Lord which they call St. <hi>Saviours</hi> about 10. or 12. foot high, now this Saint, diſtinguiſhable from their Petty Saints by his large bulk and ſtature, is Worſhipped by them for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Corn, and of their Vines, from Cold, Froſt, and Tempeſt, for curing their Horſes of the Staggers, keeping Sheep from the Rot, Bees from dying, and for defending their Lambs from
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48378:27"/>
Wolves. Therefore on his Feſtival where theſe great Images are erected, you may ſee an Infinite Number of Pilgrims of all Ages, and Conditions, bringing their Gifts to thoſe <hi>Statues.</hi> Some bring one thing, ſome another, according to their Qualities, or Capacities; for the Idol or rather the Prieſt, are not ſo ſquea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh but any thing will go down with them for Advantage, and their Temples (like Parſonage Barns) will entertain any ſort of Grain. There you might ſee vaſt Quantities of Wool, Corn, Thred, Butter, Bacon, Hony, Sucking Piggs, Grapes; all brought Mony, or ſome other good thing as valuable, and none came without wax Tapers, to burn all the while that Maſſes were ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Altar: So that beſides Cheſts full of the fore-recited materials, Tables Loaden with great pieces of meat, and a Number of all ſorts of Proviſions: there have been gathered up, in five hours time, of ſhort ends of Candles, full three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten pounds of wax, by the Light of which you may certainly ſee the dreadful Idolatry of the Romiſh Church. <hi>De la Mot,</hi> Sermon at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> 1675. <hi>page.</hi> 68.</p>
            <p>It was, and is the Doctrine, and ought to be the belief of every true Son of the

have had, and have the ſame Opinions and Judgments of Saints, whoſe Images they have made and Worſhipped, as the Gentiles Idolaters had of their Gods, and afterwards ſhall be declared, that our Image maintainers and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, have uſed, and uſe the ſame outward Rites of honouring and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping their Images, as the Gentiles did uſe before their Idols; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they Commit Idolatry as well Inwardly and Outwardly as did the wicked Gentiles Idolaters.</p>
                  <p>And concerning the firſt part of the Idolatrous Opinions of our Image-main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers.

What be ſuch Saints to whom the ſafe guard of certain Cities are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, but <hi>Dij Preſides</hi> with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles Idolaters: ſuch as were at <hi>Delphos, Appollo</hi>; at <hi>Athens, Minerva</hi>; at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, Juno</hi>; at <hi>Rome Quirinus,</hi> &amp;c. What be ſuch Saints to whom, contrary to the uſe of the primitive Church, Temples, and Churches be builded, and

Altars erected but <hi>Dij Patroni,</hi> of the Gentiles Idolaters: ſuch as were in the <hi>Capitol, Jupiter</hi>; in <hi>Paphos</hi> Temple, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>; in <hi>Epheſus</hi> Temple <hi>Diana</hi>; and ſuch like. Alaſs we ſeem in our thus think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and doing to have learn'd our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion not out of Gods Word, but out of the Pagan Poets, who ſay, <hi>Exceſſere omnes adytis, Ariſque relictis, Dij quibus Imperium hoc Steterat,</hi> &amp;c. That is to ſay, all the Gods, by whoſe defence this Empire ſtood, are gone out of the Temples, &amp; have forſaken their Altars. And where one Saint hath Images in divers places, the ſame Saint hath divers names thereof, moſt like to the Gentiles. When you hear of <hi>our Lady</hi> of <hi>Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> our <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> our <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Wilſdon</hi> and ſuch other: What is it but an Imitation of the Gentiles Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Diana Agrotera, Diana Coriphea, Diana Epheſia,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Venus Cypria, Venus Paphia, Venus Guidia.</hi> Wherein is evidently meant, that the Saint for the Image ſake, ſhould in thoſe places, yea, in the Images themſelves have a <hi>dwelling</hi>; which is the ground of their Idolatry; for where no Images be, they have no ſuch means. <hi>Terentius Varro,</hi> ſheweth that there were three hundred <hi>Jupiters</hi> in his time, there, were no few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Veneres,</hi> and <hi>Dianae,</hi> we had no fewer

I think we had no fewer Saints, to whom we gave the honour due to God. And they have not only ſpoiled the true living God of his due honour in Temples, Countries, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Lands, by ſuch devices, and Inventions, as the Gentiles Idolaters have done before them: But the Sea &amp; waters, have as well ſpecial Saints with them as they had Gods with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Neptune, Triton, Nereus, Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux, Venus,</hi> and ſuch other.

All diſeaſes have their ſpecial Saints, as

Gods the Curers of them. The <hi>Pox,</hi> St. <hi>Roche</hi>; The falling evil St. <hi>Cornelis</hi>; The Toothake, St. <hi>Apollin,</hi> &amp;c. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Cattle</hi> lack their <hi>Gods</hi> with us, for Saint <hi>Loy</hi> is the Horſe-leech, and St. <hi>Anthony</hi> the Swine-herd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where is Gods Providence, and due Honour in the mean ſeaſon? who ſaith <hi>the Heavens be mine, and the Earth is mine,</hi> &amp;c. But we have left him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heaven, nor Earth, nor Water, nor Country, nor City, nor Peace, nor War, to Rule and Govern, neither Men nor Beaſts, for their diſeaſes to cure: That a godly man might juſtly for zealous Indignation cry out, O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! O Earth! and Seas! what madneſs and wickedneſs againſt God are Men fallen into? What diſhonour do the Creatures to their Creator and maker? And if we remember God ſometimes, yet becauſe we doubt of his Ability, or will to help, we join to him another helper, as if he were a Noun Adjective, uſing theſe ſayings; ſuch as learn, <hi>God</hi> and St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> be my ſpeed, ſuch as neeſe, <hi>God</hi> help and St. <hi>John</hi>: to the Horſe <hi>God</hi> and St. <hi>Loy</hi> ſave thee; thus are we become like Horſes and Mules, which have no underſtanding. For is there not one God only, who by his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48378:30"/>
Power and Wiſdom made all things, and by his Providence governeth the ſame, and by his Goodneſs maintaineth and ſaveth them? Be not all things of him, by him, and through him? Why doſt thou turn from the Creator to the Creature? This is the manner of the Gentiles Idolaters: But thou art a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; and therefore by Chriſt alone haſt acceſs to God the Father &amp; help of him only. Theſe things are not written to any reproach of the Saints themſelves, who were the true Servants of God, &amp; did give all Honour to him, taking none unto themſelves, and are Bleſſed Souls with God: But againſt our fooliſhneſs and wickedneſs, making of the <hi>true Servants</hi> of God, <hi>falſe Gods,</hi> by attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them the Power, and Honour which is due to God only.</p>

               <q>If anſwer be made, that they make Saints but Interceſſors to God, and means for ſuch things as they would obtain of God: That is even after the Gentiles Idolatrous uſage, to make them of Saints, Gods, called <hi>Dii Medioximi,</hi> to be mean Interceſſours, and helpers to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The homily calls it a Lewd diſtinction of <gap reason="foreign">

And after a great many ridiculous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of theirs, in reference to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques are reckon'd up, the Homily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <q>that they are, not only more wicked than the Gentiles Idolaters, but alſo no wiſer than Horſes, Aſſes, and Mules, which have no underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>

Roman Church, ſhould be neglected to be read in ſuch a time, when they have the Impudence to face us down with their bold and falſe denyals of their Ethnick Doctrines, and practiſes. Hereby we ſee what Opinion the Reformed Church of <hi>England</hi> hath of their dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable Polytheiſm, or making a plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Gods; In this they act exactly as the Holy Scriptures ſpeak of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Antichriſt, <hi>with all deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs</hi>: and teach up the very <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Original of this Saint and Angel Worſhip was from the Heathen, is plain from <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> a very Credible Author, in his Church Hiſtory, book the 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 28. Where he informs us that one Peter <hi>Gnapheus,</hi> an Heretical Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the fifth Century (which was before the year 500) was the firſt that Inſtituted the Worſhip of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and that her name ſhould be called upon in the publick Prayers of the Church; which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe teſtifyed by the Hiſtorians of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburg,</hi> cent. 5. <hi>chap.</hi> 10. and this may fairly be reckoned as the firſt publick entrance and eſtabliſhment of Saint-Worſhip in General; ſince 'tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> obtained the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48378:32"/>
(or rather Diſhonour) of their Miſdirected Devotions, as ſoon as any other meaner Saint: yet true it is that ſome private men, Tranſported with blind zeal, and a little Tinctured with <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes</hi> Notions, did before begin to hanker after ſome ſuch thing, and ſome of the Fathers, now &amp; then, ſeemed to give too much encouragement thereto, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Panegyricks; and flaſhes of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick on departed Martyrs; amongſt the reſt St. <hi>Jerom</hi> was much addicted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and for the ſame juſtly oppoſed by <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> in a Treatiſe wrote on that very occaſion.</p>
            <p>The Worſhiping of Angels had no better ground, for that practiſe was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently Introduced by certain Hereticks, thence called <hi>Angelici,</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Ad Quod vult Deum, cap.</hi> 39. and indeed theſe ſeem to have infeſted the Church in the Apoſtles days, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning that Caution of St. <hi>Paul, Coloſs.</hi> 2.19. Let no Man beguile you in a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary humility, and Worſhiping of Angels, not holding the <hi>head, &amp;c.</hi> Which the Greek Scholiaſt, <hi>pa.</hi> 697. thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets. There were (ſays he) divers, that under pretence of modeſty, forbad them to go to Chriſt by themſelves, but that the favour of Angels muſt be Intreated
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48378:32"/>
to Introduce us to God, So <hi>Theodoret</hi> on the ſame text, <hi>p.</hi> 766. Uſeing pretence of Humility, they gave Counſel to pray to Angels; ſaying, we could neither ſee, nor comprehend, nor come to God; and therefore muſt Conciliate his favour by Mediation of Angels.</p>
            <p>It is evident this Saint and Angel Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is a piece of revived Paganiſme. For the Gentiles beſides their <hi>Dii Superi,</hi> which they owned to be Gods by Nature, had their <hi>Daemons,</hi> and their <hi>Hero's</hi> the Spirits of brave Men departed, whom they Worſhipt (juſt as our Papiſts do,) not ſimply and abſolutely, but as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours for them to the Superiour Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Hence <hi>Tully</hi> in his book <hi>de Legibus, Deos,</hi> &amp;c. Let the Gods be Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>as well</hi> thoſe of the upper houſe, who were always counted Celeſtial, as <hi>thoſe</hi> whom their <hi>own Merits</hi> have called into Heav'n. And again he ſays, <hi>Deorum mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um jura ſancta ſunto, hos letho datos, Divos habento</hi>; Let the rights of the Ghoſt-Gods be kept inviolable, and let them after death be Worſhiped as ſecond-rate Deities, by which is evident how exactly our Catholick Romans have renewed the Idolatrous Laws of their Heathen Anceſtours. The Gentiles Attributed the ſame offices to their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48378:33"/>
Demons, which our Papiſts expect from their Saints; to be Mediators, Factors, or Agents for them, ſo <hi>Plato in Synopſi.</hi> All intercourſe between Gods, and Men is performed by Demons; they are the Carriers of Mens Prayers to the Gods, and they bring back rewards of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to mortals, ſo <hi>Apuleius</hi> in his Demon Son. <hi>Cuncta Coeleſtium voluntate, Numine, &amp; Authoritate fiunt, ſed Demonum Obſequio, operì &amp; Miniſterio.</hi> All things (ſays he) are done by the Will, Power, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Celeſtial Gods, but by the means diſpatch, and Miniſtration of Demons. By which they did not aſcribe an abſolute, but only an Interceſſive Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to them.</p>
            <p>It is certain that the Papiſt can no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove their ſetting up, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping of Images to be Lawful, and not of Heatheniſh Original; then the Iſraelites could the ſetting up their Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> or <hi>Solomon</hi> and the ſucceeding Kings Juſtify their ſetting up the Altars of <hi>Baal,</hi> and <hi>Moloch,</hi> and the reſt of their Abominations, which are reckoned amongſt the higheſt provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Almighty, who always by his Prophets warned them againſt that deteſtable and crying ſin, &amp; denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Wrath of God againſt them;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48378:33"/>
which ever follow'd them with ſevere Judgments for thoſe horrid Impieties, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.35, to 43, There the Idols of the Heathen are called Devils, to which they Sacrificed Innocent Blood, ſo that 'tis ſaid in, <hi>verſ.</hi> 40. The wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, inſomuch that he abhorred his own Inheritance.</p>
            <p>One of the firſt Images that ever we read of, that was ſet up purpoſly to be Worſhiped, was that conſecrated to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> the Succeſſor of <hi>Ninus</hi> amongſt the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> who were <hi>Paynimas</hi>; and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> teſtifieth in his, <hi>Eccl. Hiſt. l.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. Or in the Greek 18. The Men of old out of a <hi>Heatheniſh Cuſtom</hi> were wont after that manner to honour thoſe they called Hero's or Saviours. And in the year of our Redemption 606. Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the fourth Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> cauſed a Heathen Temple called <hi>Pantheon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe built to the honour of all the Gods, to be dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and all Saints: and likewiſe Inſtituted that Feſtival called all Saints day, wherein the Pope himſelf muſt read ſervice.</p>
            <p>Diverſe alſo of the Images which the Pagans had Worſhipped, were dipt into the name of Saints, and under that notion are ſtill Worſhipped. Upon the whole then
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48378:34"/>
here is a bare Exchange of Pagan Gods, for Popiſh Idols, and Heatheniſh Heroes, for modern Saints. So that it may be ſaid of them, <hi>they have Changed their Gods, but not their Religion.</hi> But they are ſtill ſtocks, and ſtones, and the work of mens hands, by <hi>what names or Titles ſoever they Dignify and Diſtinguiſh them,</hi> &amp; are guilty of as much, yea much more Idolatry and Blaſphemy than their Predeceſſors the Heathen Romans, for they knew not the Evangelical Rule, and could not be reckoned ſuch willful, obſtinate, &amp; incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible oppoſers of the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. So that what <hi>Lamech</hi> ſaid to his two wives, may with ſome Alteration be applyed in this caſe. If the Pagan be avenged ſeven fold ſurely the Papiſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty and ſeven fold.</p>
            <p>They pay the ſame Adoration to their Images, as they do to God the Father, for him they repreſent by (ſometimes) the Image of an old man with a Globe in his hand, and a reverend beard. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they figure the Trinity as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Poets did <hi>Cerberus,</hi> by an Image with three heads, and faces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With a Solemn pace they paſs before them, and fall down to the ground on their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bones, they go Pilgrimage to them,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48378:34"/>
preſent them Lamps, and Candles, and offer up Incenſe, and Gold: whilſt ſome pretending ſtrange Miracles and lying Wonders, hang up Crutches, Chains, Legs, Arms, and whole men of War at their Shrines; as if by them they had been delivered from Lameneſs, Sickneſs, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, or Ship-wrack, ſome of theſe they pretend have more vertue, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them, than others: ſuch a one (ſay they) was ſent from Heaven, like the <hi>Palladium,</hi> or <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians</hi>; another was brought by Angels, a Third came it ſelf from Eaſt to Weſt, as Dame fortune fled to <hi>Rome.</hi> With a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ſuch Fopperies, wherein they not only act over all the Fictions, and Fables of the Heatheniſh Poets, but vaſtly tranſcend them. They Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their Images as Gods, beſtowing Divine Attributes upon them; taking them to be at the ſame time in all parts of the world, giving Audience both in this and the Lower Hemiſphere, at millions of diſtant places, at once, as well as their privy Chambers, as <hi>Loretto, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtella, Canterbury,</hi> &amp;c. They Solicit them for pardon of ſin, and Conferring the graces of the Spirit, and to bring them into a State of Glory after this Life. For all which they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48378:35"/>
to Saints, and Angels, as well as to God the Father; which is plain by the words of their Prayers, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Offices,</p>
            <p>By all which it evidently appears, that theſe Bigotted wretches ſeek unto Devils, inſtead of God, for the Saints, cannot, dare not hear them; And they Worſhip they know not what; nor can it be doubted that they who ſeek to the Devil in forbidden Images and Idols, will be ready to entertain him in a ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Confederacy, and that Religion that teaches them to ſenſe and ſmoak his Statues, and Altars, will Embolden, if not lead them into nearer familiarities and Acquaintance. Therefore I hope the Reader will Pardon me that I have been thus long expoſing their Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Idolatry; it being from thence, as the fountain that all other their Deluſions, &amp; wicked practiſes naturally flow. And thoſe whom the Devil can draw away to the Worſhip of falſe Gods, he may eaſily Impoſe upon to ſet up a Shrine to his Infernal Deity, and enter into all the Myſteries of thoſe Black and Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Arts and Confederacies, which are the ſubject of the enſuing Narrations.

               <p>IN an Age Productive of Prodigies and Wonders, it doth not ſeem to be the leaſt to men of ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and accurate Scrutiny; That a ſort of Witty and (otherwiſe) Ingenious, Perſons ſhould openly, and with great zeal profeſs a disbeleif of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of Daemons, and Witches: As if thereby they intended to declare, that the beſt and moſt Authentick Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians of former times, the moſt Learned and ſtrict Divines; yea, the unerring Wiſdom of God himſelf, had all conſpired to impoſe upon them a belief of things purely fabulous, and mere Chimerical Fantoms. Thus whilſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48378:36"/>
they aſſume to themſelves an arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Confidence to deny the Divine Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the Power of the Omnipotent; Arraigning the Equity of the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ages, the Juſtice of the moſt Solemn Judicatories, and that of all Times, and Nations; and deride the wiſdom of the moſt learned Councils, which hath ſtill run counter to their fancies. <hi>Themſelves</hi> ſeem to be a <hi>proof</hi> of <hi>what they deny</hi>; and are perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the power of <hi>Faſcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and a <hi>prevailing Daemon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 'tis hardly to be ſuppoſed, that any thing leſs ſhould render men Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable to the moſt convincing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and repeated proofs of that which they contend againſt: Notwithſtanding all which, they oppoſe their ſimple <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> againſt the moſt unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Teſtimonies, of perſons of the greateſt Integrity and Generoſity, amongſt whom they converſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of that caution and candour, that any diſintereſted and ingenuous man could not poſſibly imagin to have any deſign to impoſe upon others, what themſelves had not with the greateſt inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of circumſtances, been convinced to be beyond a poſſibility of Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48378:36"/>Yet ſuch was the bold confidence of ſome of theſe Witch Advocates that they durſt Effront that Relation of the Daemon of <hi>Tedworth,</hi> publiſhed by the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Glanvil,</hi> and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon,</hi> a Gentleman, and a Divine, who (to all that knew them) were never over fond of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting ſtories of that kind; Yet (I ſay) had ſome of this ſort of men the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to declare to the World that that whole <hi>Relation</hi> was but a Figment, or Forgery, and that Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Glanvill</hi> had retracted, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had publiſhed touching that Tranſaction.

               </p>
               <p>So that we ſee in the ſecond Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Saduceiſmus triumphatus,</hi> both Mr. <hi>Glanvil,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon,</hi> again renew, and confirm the Truth of their former Teſtimony, thereby giving the world a juſt Occaſion to deteſt the baſe Artifices of ſuch bold Impoſtors,</p>

down all the moſt undeniable proofs; I have not met with any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of theirs which hath not been ſufficiently refuted and baffled, by thoſe Learned and Ingenious Pens who have ſtill made it their buſineſs to Vindicate and Reſcue ſubſtantial Truth, from the Attacques of Atheiſts, and Scepticks.</p>
               <p>All that ſeems to remain unconquered of theſe <hi>Incredulous,</hi> is a fleering ſort of ſham-ſtories, and Mock-Relations; in the recital of which, it is pleaſant to obſerve with what Elevation they make their fooliſh Triumphs over thoſe Truths, one of which is enough to vanquiſh a thouſand of their little Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

               <p>Which opinion (if they will not allow it to proceed from incredulity) appears to be the effect of rank igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; For who that hath read the Holy Bible diſcerns not, that <hi>Saul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, had cut off thoſe that had Familiar Spirits, and the Wizzards out of the Land, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. ch. ver. the 9.

Not unlike to this was that dreadful Judgment of Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which (at the prayer of <hi>Eliiah</hi>)

fell upon the two Captains and their Fifty's, when <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King of <hi>Samaria</hi> had ſent his ſervants to Enquire of <hi>Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,</hi> the Idol, or Daemon of <hi>Ekron.</hi> in 1. chap. 2 Book of <hi>Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how many more of this kind are mentioned in Scripture, beſides the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> will appear, if we read what is recorded of <hi>Manaſſeh, Jeſebell, Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer, with many other Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſame kind, whereof the New Teſtament, as well as the Old, hath divers extraordinary Relations, but of that the paſſage in the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> chap. 2. ver. 6. <hi>they are ſouthſayers, like the Philiſtines.</hi> And it is evident by the 19. verſe of the 18. chap. of the ſame Propheſie; that the Jewiſh Nation were in a great meaſure given up to the Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall deluſion of enquiring after Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Sorcerers, and ſuch as divined to them by Pythons; ſo that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the holy Oracles of the Divine Law; and in their difficulties they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled one another to apply themſelves to thoſe forbidden abominations. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt proceed from a Neglect, or careleſs Peruſal of the Sacred Books, that any one ſhould be ignorant of other inſtances of Witches, beſides that

of the Pythoneſs of <hi>Endor.

               <p>The Emperour at his return, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an Altar to be Erected in the Capital, having this Inſcription: <hi>Haec eſt Ara Primogeniti Dei.

And if this relation of <hi>Suidas</hi> obtain credit, it may eaſily be Evinced that they were Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or Crafty Spirits which anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the Oracles of the Heathens: for if we admit that many anſwers were given by the Cunning, and Jugling of their Prieſts; Yet it could not make for their intereſt to diſcredit their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, nor for the Credit of their Deity. But the almighty power of the Son of God forced thoſe Infatuating Spirits to acknowledge his Soveraign Divinity as the unclean Spirit in the 8. chap. of <hi>Luke,</hi> verſe 28. <hi>What have I to do with thee Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, thou Son of the most High God.</hi> Thus at the ariſing of the Son of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, did the Dark Oracles vaniſh, as the ſhadows of the night are chaſed away, by the Appearing of the Sun beames.

                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:48378:40"/>
who was of the Ships Crew, was called three times, at the third call he made anſwer <hi>Here am</hi> I; whereupon the voice bad him, when he came to the <hi>Palodes</hi> (certain Shelves in the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea) that then he ſhould publiſh that <hi>the great Pan was dead.</hi> And then the Ship was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of her reſtraint and went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſo that wh<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n they came to the place appointed, <hi>Thamus</hi> from the Poop of the Ship, publiſhed what he had been commanded; whereupon followed a great noiſe of ſhrieking and lamenting together, ſo that the Sea reſounded with the lamentation. The Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> having been made acquainted with this paſſage, demanded of his wiſe men; who this great God <hi>Pan</hi> might be? But the beſt anſwer they could give him, was, that he was the Son of <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Penelope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this circumſtance happening juſt at the time when our Saviour was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, it was concluded by more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent and conſiderate men, that by the <hi>Great God Pan</hi> was meant the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Redeemer of <hi>Mankind</hi>; who by his Death on the croſs, Overthrew the Kingdom, and power of Satan; ſo that the Devils were now to Quit thoſe Oracles by which they had ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48378:40"/>
the World: and on this account thoſe Spirits might be thought to make that great and diſmall lamentation. For from that time they ſoon ran into decay, and the <hi>Delphi Oracula ceſſant,</hi> which <hi>Juvenal</hi> records, makes it plain that they were but of ſhort continuance, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fatal blow given them on the Croſs, when our bleſſed Saviour gave up the Ghoſt with an <hi>It is Finiſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now had theſe Oracles been managed only by the ſubtilty and artifice of the Prieſt, it is very improbable but they might have been of longer continuance, for the Prieſts continue to be as Crafty and Covetous as ever, and as dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous at all the feats of Juggling and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerdemain.</hi> But it is plain the time of their deluſions was expired, and it is no ſmall Argument of the power of the Goſpel of Truth, that thoſe van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed Spirits flye before it; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, with the molten, and Carved Images to the Owls and to the Batts, not being able to endure the ſplendour of the Tidings of Salvation.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that in thoſe Countries where there is leaſt Idolatry, and where the ſincere preaching of the Word of Power is countenanced, there it is very rare, comparatively to meet with
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48378:41"/>
inſtances of the Satanical craft and power; his <hi>ſtrong holds</hi> are beaten down; tho ſome ſmall forts he ſtill retains amongſt the ignorant, and ſuperſtitious: but in countries where Idolatry, and Paganiſm prevail, he Governs, as among the Children of diſobedience; Here he hath his Groves, his Cells, and Hermitages, and Altars; He paſſes for a God, receiveth publick adoration; whilſt every Prieſt hath his Familiar, and the Doctrine of Devils paſſes for ſaving Truth. In Countries more Barbarous, he is Worſhiped for Fear, (as amongſt the <hi>Indians</hi>) and there he often ſhews himſelf to them in mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſhapes, Dreadful to behold, to affright them into their damnable ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and idolatries. In Countries where Humane Learning hath obtained, a pretended Antiquity, and Doctrine of the Ancients is that by which they Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their ſuperſtitions; whilſt a blind Obedience, and miſguided Zeal, tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles whole Nations down the dreadful precipices of Blaſphemy and Devil-worſhip. And to theſe the Grand Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor appears in ſhapes, and figures Divine and Angelical (for the moſt part) ſweetning them in their Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Apoſtacy and Idolatry, by glorious

Apparitions and Revelations, ſometimes to one Saint ſometimes to another; and this in order to the promulgation of ſome Doctrine that may advance his dark Empire, and Deſigns; which muſt be confirmed by ſeeming Miracles and Lying Wonders, the more to Infatuate the minds of their deluded Bigots, and confirm in them a belief of their dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Impoſtures.</p>
               <p>And tho ſome perhaps may Imagin that what hath been ſaid, ſignifies little to the proof of the exiſtence of Witches; they may by weighing, and comparing the Argument, find an evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration thereof: For what leſs than the Sorceries of their Prieſts, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing influence of evil Angels, could poſſibly ſhut up ſo many Nations, and that from the firſt Ages, under ſuch groſs, and ſtupendious <hi>Blaſphemy, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſm?</hi> So that if the Queſtion were put, which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> demands of the <hi>Galatians, chap.</hi> 3 <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. O Fooliſh <hi>Galatians,</hi> who hath <hi>Bewitched</hi> you, that you ſhould not obey the Truth? It might truly be anſwered, that the Devil with the aſſiſtance and confederacy of their Idol Prieſts hath done it. This Indeed, is the moſt deplorable kind of Faſcination,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48378:42"/>
whereby mens Souls and Faculties are Captivated to their ſpiritual Enemy, and their minds and conſciences are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed. It is impoſſible almoſt to relieve men in this kind of deluſion, becauſe the whole Current of their miſguided De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, runs Diametrically oppoſite to the means of their Cure. But of this more will be ſaid in a following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where the <hi>Witchcraft</hi> of Idolatrous, and Popiſh Prieſts, will be particularly Treated of.</p>
               <p>Others there are amongſt the Devils Advocates, that would fain inſinuate, that becauſe ſome particular Men have Endeavoured to attain this Helliſh Art, and could not arrive to it; others have gone a little way in Magical perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, but could never do any great Exploits, or ſhew any Extraordinary feats in that profound Science, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch acquirements are not at all Attainable, but above the reach of the Black Myſteries; ſuch was <hi>Nero,</hi> who becauſe his purſuit of that Infernal ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was not attended with any Fatal proficiency, he is ſaid to have contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Magicall Art, as pretending to ſuch performances, as it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attain to and therefore he ſate down a Deſpiſer of ſuch as boaſted their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48378:42"/>
knowledg in thoſe Myſteries: But it is no wonder that the Devil complyed not with his ſtudies in that School, Since <hi>Nero</hi> of his own Nature was ſo much a Devil, that had he been furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with any of thoſe more ſubtil Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it is probable he might have Attempted ſuch things as ſhould have Exceeded all that went before him, and have put his <hi>drudging Spirits</hi> upon ſuch performances as (tho they might not Exceed the fierceneſs of their diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet) might ſurmount their Power. But, from hence to argue that <hi>there are no Witches,</hi> ſeems as incongruous, as if I <hi>ſhould ſay there is no ſuch thing as a Lyon, or a Wolf, which kill and devour the Herds, and Flocks, becauſe I have a little Dog at home that cannot do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor ought it to be attributed to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous power, that Daemons and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches preſent themſelves in various ſhapes, ſomtimes Humane, ſomtimes Beſtial, at other times Monſtrous, and now and then in their proper forms: for as we cannot underſtand the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found knowledge that ſubtil and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual beings have of Natural Cauſes above the ſtretch of our Enquiry; ſo can we much leſs Limit their free and unconfined agencies, to Qualities and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48378:43"/>
reaſons within our comprehenſions for as they have the advantage of a Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Intelligence, they can from time to time Impart things ſtrange and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to us: And their Airy ſubſtances are capable of putting on diverſities of figures, and they can aſſume ſuch a Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle as may repreſent any reſemblance they pleaſe; that it is much eaſier for us to conceive they may borrow the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of Lower ſhapes, than the Garb and Mien of the Angels of Light.</p>
               <p>And if at any time they Cloath their Daemoniac Confederates in repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions different from their proper Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtencies, it is to be attributed to that knowledge they have of Occult Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which is above the Inveſtigation of our Scrutinies. By the following Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it will appear that at the ſame time a Cat or other Creature hath been cut, or wounded; the Hurt hath manifeſtly appeared upon the body of the Witch, in that very part where the other Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Reſemblance hath to apearance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the blow given. Nor would we have the reader Imagin that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the bare following Relations is all that we inſiſt upon as a proof of what is here Aſſerted; but theſe are publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as a farther Confirmation of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48378:43"/>
of Fact which to the Judgment of all Ingenious and Unprejudiced Perſons, are already ſufficiently proved, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Hiſtories of all former Ages, and that not barely of the Rude and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, but even of the moſt Civilized and Polite Times; beſides the Exquiſite pens of the moſt Learned and ſober Writers of our Age, which have given ample and undeniable Atteſtation of the Exiſtence of Witches, and Diabolical Contracts.</p>
               <p>To thoſe that Object the Improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſuch Tranſactions, and that the ſtories of Witches Tranſmuting of ſhapes, Flying in the Air, and ſuch like, are impoſſible to Natural reaſon: So much hath already been ſaid in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, that it would be prepoſterous to add any thing more. Onely this may be added, that the more unaccountable theſe things ſeem to be in themſelves (The real matter of Fact being proved) it ought the more to prevail towards a belief of thoſe extraordinary Agencies; for ſuch as endeavour to impoſe ſtrange Fictions upon the Credulous, uſe to adapt them as near as they can to a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of Truth in the management; tho attended with very ſtrange, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly Prodigious circumſtances: And
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48378:44"/>
if they would have them to appear to be Imaginary Fictions; yet it is ſtrange that People of all ſorts, in all Ages, ſhould agree to publiſh to the World the ſame Exploded conceits.</p>
               <p>And for thoſe that ſay they cannot conceive how ſuch things can be done; That is no ſmall Argument of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Conceptions, Apprehenſions,</hi> and <hi>Knowledg</hi> of ſuch, who are apt to diſpute the certainty of any thing that is above their Sphere; and it will not be found at all available againſt the Poſſibility of ſuch performances, no more than a Mans doubting how it is poſſible that the Sea doth Ebb and Flow, ſhould be an Argument that there were no ſuch thing in Nature. We cannot conceive how from ſuch ſmall, and various Seeds, ſuch different ſpecies of Plants and Trees receive their Formation; or how the Extream diſtant Natures and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Soul and Body are United: but Yet notwithſtanding our Ignorance, theſe things are very Obvious to our ſenſe; tho beyond the Comprehenſion of our Reaſons: and therefore it is no wonder if we are ſtrangers to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and Powers of Creatures that do not appear to us.</p>
               <p>Therefore the beſt Judgment we can
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48378:44"/>
make of ſuch extraordinary things is by the Evidence, and not the Meaſure of our Fancies. For by this we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly convinced that ſuch things are really ſo, tho by reaſon of our confined Circumſtances we are not able to penetrate into the Rationality of their Contingencies.</p>

               <p>THE laſt Chapter having deſigned that Idol Worſhip (as the Devil is therein propoſed Objectively to be Adored) Is not only a great Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancer, but Tends vaſtly to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of Diabolical Confederacies. Before we proceed to a particular and Hiſtorical Account of Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Witches, it may be neceſſary a little farther to explain what we mean by a Witch; and how far the power of ſuch a one may be underſtood And this being a nice and difficult de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48378:45"/>
The Candid Reader ſhall find very little new Aſſerted Notions either in Relation to their perſons or practices; but we ſhall chuſe to lay down what the moſt Unprejudiced, Learned, and Sober Writers of things relating to Matters of this Nature have upon their beſt ſearch and Enquiry determined.</p>
               <p>And firſt it is agreed that it is very difficult to prove ſuch, or ſuch a one to be a <hi>Witch,</hi> and it ought to be done with the greateſt <hi>Caution and Tenderneſs Imaginable:</hi> The loſs being greater on the part of <hi>a falſe Teſtimony,</hi> than on that of a <hi>Suppoſed Criminal</hi>; Infernal <hi>Contracts</hi> are not ſuppoſed to be made in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Witneſſes; being as hath been ſaid, againſt the Law of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi>; So that the Devil out of a ſeeming <hi>regard</hi> to the ſafety and <hi>Immunity</hi> of his <hi>Proſtitute</hi> may omit the Ceremony of <hi>Teſtes</hi>; the black pupil acting with greater ſecurity when ſhe apprehends none knows of, or is <hi>privy</hi> to the <hi>Confederation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet is there no doubt but the Devil is as ſecure of his prey as if the whole world had ſubſcribed a <hi>Teste</hi> to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture; for by the conſent of the party, he hath <hi>Seiſin</hi> of her as his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi>; which he will be ſure never to part with, unleſs <hi>Ejected by a ſtronger
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48378:45"/>
than He.</hi> Thoſe Helliſh <hi>Compacts</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are Managed like the filthy <hi>Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi> betwixt a <hi>Fornicator</hi> and his <hi>Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> where it may be no <hi>Eye ſees them</hi> that may Expoſe them to the penalties of Humane Laws; and it is difficult to prove matter of fact between them; but at laſt a Spurious off-ſpring, or a more Nauſeous Rotteneſs unveils them to the world, and they linger out to a more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Death, than if the Law had Chaſtiſed them; The Rotteneſs of their bones giving them more ſevere pains and Twinges than the Rod of Juſtice could have done: Not unlike this do ſome of theſe Infernal Proſtitutes Eſcape the hand of the publick Juſtice until at laſt their loath'd and miſerable Lives are ſeized as forfeitures to the Devil; and they are found (like <hi>Fauſtus</hi>) with broken Necks, or with ſome other wrack upon their Nauſeous Bodies, that Evidently diſcovers their ſouls to have been <hi>Extorted</hi> from them, and that they have been <hi>forcibly</hi> Ejected <hi>upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture</hi> of <hi>their Leaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some too, may have been unjuſtly accuſed for Witches; either by an Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Cauſes <hi>meerly Natural,</hi> or miſapplying Cauſes that in themſelves are ſupernatural: So that the very ſame
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48378:46"/>
operations which to Intelligent, and Enquiring Philoſophers, are meerly the product of Natural <hi>Sympathies,</hi> or <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies</hi> of <hi>Heat,</hi> or <hi>Cold,</hi> or the like, to the unskilful ſhall appear, as done by Art <hi>Magical,</hi> or <hi>Diabolical</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So the <hi>Freezing</hi> a cup of ſnow-water to a Stool by the <hi>fireſide,</hi> looks to ſome weak perſons, with an Aſpect very <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>unaccountable,</hi> whilſt to thoſe that conſider and know the <hi>reſtringent</hi> Quality of the <hi>Salt,</hi> the others Admiration becomes almoſt Ridiculous.</p>
               <p>It is acknowledged by all Naturaliſts that the power of Imagination hath had, and may have ſtrange Effects, eſpecially upon tender and Irrational Bodies, ſuch as Children, Chickens, Lambs <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to that of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                  <q>Neſcio quis Teneros Oculus mihi faſcinat Agnos.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And very ſtrange performances may be effected by an Exalted and Fixed Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Intention of which vaſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes towards the Effecting things ſeemingly Impoſſible. The formation of the Child in the Mothers Womb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which if good Authority may be Credited) hath been Imputed to the force of an Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination ſtrongly poſſeſſed with ſuch, or ſuch a belief. And to this purpoſe, it is very remarkable what is by a learned
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48378:46"/>
pen related of a <hi>Lady, who being uſed to wear patches, and that during the time ſhe was with child, a Gentleman told her that her child would have ſuch a patch in its forehead; and accordingly at the birth of the Child, ſuch a ſpot was diſcerned in the place deſcribed,</hi> and ſtill remained in that ſame part of the Ladies Face, as a Teſtimony of the Impreſſion a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Imagination may have on tender Bodies. Infinite more are the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that might be mentioned of this kind, but if I ſhould Enumerate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many, it would nevertheleſs appear that the Feats, and performances of Infernal Confederacies vaſtly ſurpaſs whatſoever can be thought attainable in this kind; and this will be ſo Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by matters of Fact related in the following Collection that it would be needleſs to ſpeak any thing more to it in this place.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if it be ſuppoſed that ſome have been ſuſpected for Witches, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for having deformed Bodies, Ill Aſpects, or Melancholy Conſtitutions doth it any ways appear from hence, that there is really no ſuch thing as a Witch? Or may it not with as much reaſon be alledged, that becauſe ſome for having Arms found about them,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48378:47"/>
have been wrongfully accuſed for being Robbers; that therefore there is no ſuch thing as a High-way man. Such allegations as theſe, do not at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Exiſtence of ſuch Haggs.</p>
               <p>Tho I muſt confeſs that there is no reaſon that any perſon (by reaſon of thoſe <hi>deformities</hi> which may be only the Effects of <hi>old Age,</hi> or the product of ſome <hi>diſeaſe</hi>) ſhould be preſently In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and <hi>truſt up for a Witch</hi>; nor can I Imagine that ever ſuch a thing hath been in a Civilized Nation, without the concomitant circumſtances of ſome other proofs: That would be a hard caſe indeed! But I think it will not be difficult to prove that there have been <hi>ſome whoſe Inſides have been blackned with as foul and damnable Confederacies as others</hi>; who have notwithſtanding appeared with Faces very <hi>Charming,</hi> and <hi>Angelical.</hi> For we have no account of any very Nauſeous deformity that ſate on the forehead of <hi>Jeſabel, Joan of Arc,</hi> or <hi>Joan Queen of Naples.</hi> And perhaps the Attempts of theſe Helliſh Agents may paſs with leſs Suſpicion, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the plauſible diſguiſe of a <hi>handſom Face</hi>: For from Objects <hi>Naſty</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi> men Naturally turn away, with a kind of <hi>Innate Averſion</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi>;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48378:47"/>
whilſt under the <hi>Charming Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of a fair Face, the <hi>Magical Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Inſenſibly</hi> Steals upon <hi>men. Nor is the Devil at any time more dangerous, than when he appears as an Angel of Light.</hi>

                  <hi>Spotſwood</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> book the 6th. page 383. Reports that there was one <hi>Agnes Sampſon</hi> amongſt the Witches and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers of that Kingdom, who was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the <hi>Wiſe Wife of Keith,</hi> who was very remarkable; being (as he ſays) a Woman not of the ſordid and baſe ſort of Witches, in outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but of a Matron like, and grave Mein, ſettled, and ſeemingly Judicious in her anſwers; who upon her Examination declared, That ſhe had a Familiar Spirit, which upon her Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation uſually appeared to her in a Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble form, &amp; reſolved her of doubtful Matters, eſpecially concerning Matters relating to the Life or Death of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons lying ſick, and that he had taught her, when ſhe called him, to uſe the word <hi>Holla Maſter.</hi> Upon which he uſually appeared to her. See <hi>Wanly's Wonders of the little World.</hi> lib. 5. chap. 20. <hi>So that Deformity alone is no more an Argument of a Witch, than Beauty may be ſaid to be an Evidence of a Whore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:48378:48"/>Somtimes, it is Objected, that ſome have come in and given Evidence againſt themſelves; and being brought before Magiſtrates, have (it may be thought) cauſleſly accuſed themſelves, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing themſelves to be Witches, and relating divers things by them done (as they have ſuppoſed) by the help of the Devil. And all this may be the Effect of a Deep Melancholy, or ſome Terrour that they may have been under: or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps an Argument that themſelves have at the ſame time been under the Power of Witchcraft; or at leaſt in ſome kind of Delirium of Phancy. So ſome Lunaticks have fancied themſelves to be Kings, or Queens, and it hath been beyond the Power of the moſt Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Arguments, and Demonſtrations to convince them of the contrary: But the Self-accuſations of ſuch is as little to be credited, as the Self-Compur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and Applauſes of others; without ſome more ſubſtantial Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>It is Obſervable that Witches are commonly of the Female Sex, and ſome there are that confine that Term wholly to them: And ever ſince the prevalence of the Firſt Temptation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt Woman; it is no wonder
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48378:48"/>
if the ſubtil Adverſary ſtill offer his Baits to ſuch palats as are moſt deſirous to taſte Fruits forbidden; and more negligent in Enquiring into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of what they Swallow. It was an Obſervation of <hi>Fulgentius, Neſcio quid habet Muliebre Nomen ſemper cum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris.</hi> And it has been a long time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of them, that if they incline to Virtue and Piety, few go beyond them; but if they take up with <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious</hi> and evil courſes, none ſurpaſs them in Heights of Wickedneſs and miſchief.</p>
               <p>Tho theſe wretched Artiſts are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly diſtinguiſhed into thoſe of the <hi>Black,</hi> and <hi>White</hi> orders; they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the ſame, and cannot be ſaid to differ in deeds of darkneſs, which admit of no difference of Colour, They are certainly both alike guilty in Compounding with the Devil. The black are thoſe which are looked upon to do the moſt Miſchief, becauſe they commonly Torment mens bodies, or Injure them in their Eſtates; and the White, are reckoned to be ſuch as reſtore people to health, and to goods loſt: So that accordingly they have acquired the Names of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> Women. <hi>But what Fellowſhip hath Light
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48378:49"/>
with Darkneſs, or what Communion hath Chriſt with Belial.</hi> Both theſe deal in the ſame forbidden Arts, and Equally bring Clients to their Helliſh Maſter. They may be ſaid to be like the Glaſiers boys about the Town, who Employ themſelves to break the Neighbours windows, that their Maſters may have the profit of mending them again.</p>
               <p>Some Ancient Arts and Myſteries are ſaid to be loſt, but we have reaſon to believe that the Father of Miſcheif will not let fall any of thoſe Trades by which he brings Souls to perdition, as long as he can have Scholars, and Servants to carry on his purpoſes.</p>
               <p>So that we need not doubt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of that Ancient Devil-Craft, and Infernal Combination, as long as a Sordid Ignorance, Revengeful Malice, or Blind Superſtition remain in the World. The Ignorant reſort to it as to a School of Inſtruction, where they proceed and graduate themſelves in the Curſed Mathematicks, and Myſteries of the Lower World. The Malicious apply themſelves for Revenge, to wreak their ſpleens upon thoſe they have Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity againſt: and they are all the <hi>better part of Mankind</hi>: For if once they become in League with the Devil, they muſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48378:49"/>
be ſuppoſed to have eſpouſed his Intereſt ſo far, as to <hi>ſtretch out their Malice anſwerable to his Enmity, which is againſt all Mankind</hi> in general, but particularly againſt thoſe of the greateſt <hi>Integrity</hi>: as is evident in the caſe of our <hi>Firſt Parents, Job,</hi> our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour and his Holy Apoſtles.</hi> And in the Revelation of St. <hi>John,</hi> the Angel tells the Church of <hi>Smyrna, that the Devil ſhould caſt ſome of them into priſon that they might be Tryed.</hi> And Luke 22. chap. 31. verſ. He tells <hi>Peter</hi> that <hi>Satan had deſired to winnow him,</hi> as they do wheat, but our Lord had prayed for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this muſt be Imputed to that Enmity which was put between the ſeed of the Woman, and that of the Serpent; So that ever ſince the Apoſtate Angel hath by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his wicked Agents, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually been Attempting to wreak his Revenge upon them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Superſtitious</hi> are with as much eaſe, as any, drawn into the Fatal ſnare, for <hi>they often become Witches, by endeavouring to defend themſelves againſt Witchcraft.</hi> Theſe doubting that ſome Witch might have power to hurt them, arm themſelves with the Devil's <hi>Shield</hi> againſt the Devil's <hi>Sword:</hi> Putting on the Armour of <hi>Charms,</hi> and <hi>Spells</hi> piecemeal
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48378:50"/>
by degrees; until at length they come to be Devil-fenc'd cap-a-pie: and ſo at firſt they are drawn into a <hi>League Defenſive</hi>; until at laſt it comes to be declared <hi>Offenſive</hi> too. That Art is quickly learnt; which wants nothing but <hi>Credulity</hi> and practice to attain it; and where the Devil once finds an <hi>Invitation,</hi> he ever after <hi>Haunts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of theſe Proficients in the <hi>Black</hi> My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, there are ſome who at firſt begin with Feats rather diverting, than Hurtful; for they are ſometimes enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Ludicrous and gameſom Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who (to appearance) do things ſeemingly pleaſant: but this <hi>paſtime</hi> coſts them dear in the End; for they play ſo long on the brink of Hell, until at length they tumble in, and ſport with the devouring <hi>Lyon,</hi> until they are ſeized by his griping <hi>Paw</hi>; from whence They never after have power to Extricate themſelves.</p>
               <p>Others there are that are prevail'd with by none of theſe conſiderations; but take up the uſe of <hi>Magical Forms,</hi> and <hi>Simples</hi> by <hi>Tradition:</hi> Thoſe that were their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors deriving down to them the uſe of ſome <hi>Myſtical words,</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies</hi> upon the recital of which, they acquire the knowledge of many ſtrange, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48378:50"/>
remote ſecrets; and are Aſſiſted in the performance of <hi>things</hi> much above the reach of a power meerly Humane. We have no reaſon to think it Improbable that the Apoſtate Spirit may have Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf, upon the bare <hi>naming,</hi> or <hi>repeating</hi> ſuch or ſuch ſet forms of words (by himſelf, perhaps Appointed) to <hi>attend</hi> upon thoſe that make uſe of them. And upon this account it is that <hi>Balaam</hi> and the Wiſemen of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi> (mentioned in the book of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>) are acquitted by Learned men, from having a particular Covenant with the Devil, or acting by the Rules of the <hi>greater Sorcery.</hi>

               <p>And here I cannot omit relating a paſſage which was told me when I was a Shool-boy in the houſe of a Learned and Religious Divine in the Country, That there formerly Lived in the ſame houſe a Parſon, who likewiſe taught the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, and having ſeveral Lads under his care; they (one day when he was at Dinner at a Gentlemans houſe about a mile from the place) happened to go into his Study, and (whether out of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, or by accident, is uncertain) were reading in a book of his, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to that forbidden Art; the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48378:51"/>
Lads continued reading, 'till divers Spirits came into the Room to them (as I remember) I was told in the Shape of boys, which ſeemed with a nimble motion to caper and play about them: Their Maſter, who was then at ſuch a diſtance from them, and at dinner, had ſome Notice of what was doing at home, and immediatly roſe from table, and repaired to them, where he found them very perplexed at their new company, but knew not how to be rid of them but upon the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in of their Maſter, they were ſoon diſcharged.</p>
               <p>Not unlike to this may be the caſe of ſome, who having by them books of <hi>Conjuration,</hi> may perhaps ignorantly, and undeſignedly peruſe them, without any previous Compact; until at length their Inquiſitive Inclinations are ſo wrought upon, as to make uſe of the more <hi>Interdicted</hi> means for their Information. Nor is it Improbable, but that ſome Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> may (in their firſt Addreſſes to that Science) aim no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the ſatisfaction of their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, in the Knowledge of <hi>Hidden</hi> and <hi>remote</hi> Queſtions; and Future Events; Whilſt thoſe Miſchievous Spirits (who like Beaſts of prey) watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48378:51"/>
all Occaſions to entrap and get them into their Envious reach: may work upon their overcurious and inquiſitive Genius's to ſearch after the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited means of ſatisfying their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Curioſity. So that <hi>Judicial Aſtrology</hi> may well be lookt upon, as a fair Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the Diabolical Art. And it ſeems not Improbable, but it might at firſt be ſet on foot as a <hi>Lure</hi> to draw the <hi>Over-curious</hi> into thoſe ſnares that lye beyond it.</p>
               <p>And whoſoever but ſeriouſly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the Nature of thoſe Queſtions, which the <hi>pretenders to that Art</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to <hi>reſolve,</hi> will find reaſon to think that they ſtep ſomwhat beyond thoſe bounds which are ſet to their <hi>Enquiries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is too much to be doubted, that thoſe who take upon them to <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> and Calculate of ſuch Occult Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies, and Futurities; are not always free from Inticements and ſolicitations to the more dangerous Correſpondencies.</p>
               <p>Tho all this while it is not denyed but that there may be an Obſervation of Sydereal and Planetical Motions, which falls not under the black Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of thoſe Interdicted Arts; but if kept within the modeſt directions of Natural Speculation, may not only
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48378:52"/>
be Lawful, but of Good uſe, to Excite in us an Admiration and Adoration of <hi>him that ſtretched out the Heavens like a Courtain, and bindeth up the ſweet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Pleiades, Cauſing the Stars in their Courſes to fight againſt ſuch as Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn his Righteous purpoſes.</hi> As we read in the Sacred pages.</p>
               <p>Nor would we be thought to include all manner of Intimation of Future Events under the Notion of unlawful Divination; ſince it is very apparent, that as the practitioners of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Study do by the Indication of the Devil and his wicked Angels, arrive to a Dear-bought Knowlegde of things to come: So oftentimes it pleaſeth God (by the bleſſed Guardians of his Saints, and) by the Miniſtry of Holy Spirits, to Impart to ſuch as truly fear him, and call upon his Name, ſome certain Intimations of his Divine pleaſure in relation to Mundane affairs, and the Changes that may happen either to his Church in general, or to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Countries, Families, or Perſons. Many Inſtances of this kind might be produced, of which, for proof ſome few ſhall be mentioned. Such was the Dream of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> Interpreted by the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and mentioned
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48378:52"/>
in the 4. <hi>chap.</hi> of that Propheſie and ſuch may that Voice which was heard in the Temple before the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> be well thought to be: When by a <hi>Migremus Hinc,</hi> an Alarm was given to the Jews to remove before the Storm of that dreadful War came upon them, which Occaſioned the deſtruction of their City and Temple.</p>
               <p>The late Reverend and Learned Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> as is written in his Life, predicted the Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> many Years before the bloody Execution of it. And King <hi>James,</hi> ſtrangely diſcovered the horrid Powder Treaſon, by that letter to the Lord <hi>Mont-Eagle</hi>; which can hardly be imputed to any thing leſs than the Courteous Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Impulſe of ſome good Genius. Nor is it at all unlikely that we are beholden to thoſe Watchful Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhers of us, for the ſeaſonable Hints of approaching Calamities, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſhew themſelves to us Either in Aerial, or other Prodigies. For theſe by the moſt Conſiderate men of all Ages have been acknowledged to be the Prodroms of great Calamities, or Cataſtrophies.</p>
               <p>So our Bleſſed Saviour tells us that there
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48378:53"/>
ſhall be <hi>Signs</hi> in the Heavens, and <hi>Signs</hi> in the Earth, before that great and terrible day of the Lord. And who knows, but theſe Indexes may be through the Care of thoſe good and tender Guardians; who out of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Welfare may give us thoſe Cautions, and Admonitions to provide our ſelves againſt a day of Tryal. The dreadful deſolations that happened in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> in the Late unnatural Warrs (which whether or no they were preſaged by them, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had many Tremendous Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Air, and on the Earth <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before thoſe Calamities broke forth amongſt them;) I ſay theſe are diſmal Teſtimonies of the conſequence of ſuch Preſages.</p>
               <p>But theſe Kind of Predictions, as they are the effects of the <hi>Benevolence</hi> of Heaven, to us ſinful Mortals, ſo they generally ſtartle and awaken a ſecure and ſinful World to meet God in the way of his Judgments: or if they have not that good effect on the ſenſual and Diſobedient; they are at leaſt Meſſengers of Joy, and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers of Grace to thoſe who apply themſelves to Study the Voice of God in his Providences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:48378:53"/>Whilſt we are foretold in the Holy Scripture that <hi>Wicked men and ſeducers ſhall wax worſe &amp; worſe, deceiving, and being deceived.</hi> For the Spirit of Deluſion to which they adhere, ſhall betray them into groſs miſtakes, and palpable devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſuch are Generally Impenetrable by the Warning of Heaven, they are Judicially Blinded, and Infatuated, that they ſhould not come to the knowledge of the Truth. Thus the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tells us of a Spirit of Lying, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Falſe Prophets, and they cryed <hi>Peace, Peace</hi>; when a ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and deſtruction from the Lord was coming upon them. And this will be the dreadful caſe of thoſe miſerable Wretches who have given themſelves up to the Conduct of the <hi>Father of Lyes</hi>; Who either <hi>out of a belief that they have no ſouls,</hi> have given themſelves over to work Wickedneſs; Or elſe deſpiſing the Glories of a Bleſſed Eternity, have Liſted themſelves under the Banner of Satan, to Fight againſt the Power of the Omnipotent. And <hi>that Atheiſm, Idolatry, Senſuality,</hi> and <hi>Debauchery,</hi> have a Natural Tendence to promote this Impious and Diabolical Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, hath been hinted in the forgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pages. Which being ſo Regulary,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48378:54"/>
Learnedly, and Largely Treated of by the Excellent pens of Dr. H. M. and Mr. J. G. before mentioned, in the ſecond part of <hi>Saduciſmus Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatus</hi>; I ſhall preſume to Wade no further in the Argumentative, and Philoſophical part; but proceed now, to give an Account of the moſt Ateſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Relations of Ancient Witches; and thence deſcend to ſome very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Credible Modern Relations, moſt of which have happened in theſe Few years, and will be atteſted by perſons of Unqueſtionable Worth and Reputation now alive amongſt us.</p>

               <p>IT is one of the Black Marks which the Apoſtle of the Gentiles gives us of Antichriſt, <hi>That he ſhall ſit in the Temple of God, and ſhew himſelf to be worſhipped as God.</hi> And if we conſider the Temples, Groves, Altars, Sacrifices and Prieſts that the Antients in the days of their Blindneſs, and ſtupid Idolatry Erected, and Conſecrated to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Deities, we ſhall find that this Exaction of Worſhip and Adoration which Antichriſt lays claim to, was in the former Ages paid unto the Devil himſelf; and that the Apoſtate Church of <hi>Rome</hi> uſurped to her Revolted Head thoſe Sacred Rites in conformity to thoſe Sacrifices which their Idolatrous Anceſtors paid unto the Revolted and Apoſtate Angels.</p>
               <p>This Chapter therefore ſhall be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48378:55"/>
filled with an Enumeration of ſome of the firſt Proficients in the Black Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Myſteries, that we may make way to parallel them with an Account of the Proficience of divers Popes and Orders among the Idolatrous Romaniſts in the ſame dark and Diabolical Arts, in ſome of the following Pages.</p>
               <p>But what Aſtoniſhment may it well raiſe in us, if we but remark, that not only thoſe Barbarous Nations that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew the true God, nor had the Advantages of his Law, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, amongſt them, ſhould follow the foul Abomination: But even the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to whom (as the Pſalmiſt elegantly expreſſes) the Almighty aroſe <hi>Early,</hi> and ſent his Prophets, who ſaw his wonders in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the Red Sea, and in the Wilderneſs, who ſaw the Lightnings, heard the Thunders, and the ſolemn noiſe of Trumpets, when their Captain <hi>Moſes</hi> receiv'd the Law from the mouth of the <hi>Moſt High</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and had there that Firſt, Poſitive and Repeated Command againſt Idol-worſhip, which (by the dreadful and amazing Judgments inflicted on them for that provoking ſin) can be thought to be underſtood no otherwiſe than Devil-worſhip. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.23. Yet
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48378:55"/>
notwithſtanding, that this <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould forſake the God that bought them, and marked them by ſpecial favours from all the Nations of the Earth! This you'l ſay is ſtupendious Ingratitude, and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Apoſtacy.</p>
               <p>What can be thought of that Biggot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Ahab,</hi> who is ſaid to have <hi>Taught Iſrael</hi> to ſin? He had been nurſt up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Whoriſh, Idolatrous Mother, the Patroneſs of the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi>: And <hi>he</hi> makes little leſs than a challenge to the Almighty to contend with his Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Baalim.</hi> See 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. They were then ſo beſotted, that they thought <hi>Baal</hi> to be a greater God, that he who laid the Foundations of the Earth, and whoſe Thunders their Rebellous Fathers had heard on the Sacred Mountain.</p>
               <p>Was it poſſible that thoſe Infernal Prieſts ſhould expect an anſwer by Fire from their deteſtable Idol, unleſs they had at ſome time or other by ſome <hi>Voice,</hi> or <hi>Motion,</hi> or by ſome <hi>Succeſs</hi> of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Adorations been deluded into an Opinion that there was ſomething Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred in that which they reared their <hi>Shrines</hi> unto? It is (I think) indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that the Devil, the Father of Lyes and Blaſphemies, had ſome way or other gull'd them into that oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48378:56"/>
Worſhip. They skipt up and down upon his Altars, and lanced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves until the blood guſhed out; with their <hi>Devils Littany, O</hi> Baal, <hi>hear us,</hi> or, <hi>We beſeech thee to hear us, O</hi> Baal. What can this be but an <hi>Invocation</hi> of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil?</hi> and bears ſo near a <hi>Reſemblance</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> as if it were the <hi>Original</hi> of <hi>it.</hi> Do the <hi>Falſe Prophets</hi> call upon the Devil in their Idol? So do the <hi>Witches</hi> call upon their Familiar: Do they <hi>offer Sacrifice</hi> to their Gods? So do <hi>theſe</hi> to their <hi>Goblins</hi>: They allure them with Incenſe and Perfumes; they eat and drink by way of Oblation to them, as the Prieſts uſed to do in their Idol-Temples: And as the Helliſh Prieſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their own Blood to <hi>Baal</hi>; ſo do theſe Infernal <hi>Haggs</hi> in their Contracts with <hi>Beelzebub.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that having now cleared the way by explaining the foul <hi>Conformity</hi> and <hi>Analogy</hi> betwixt Idolatry and Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, it may well be expected that I ſhould aſſume the premiſed Method, and give ſome Inſtances of Antient Examples to make good the <hi>Theſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore not to look back upon thoſe dreadful Examples, which the Sacred Writings afford us of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> I ſhall proceed with
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48378:56"/>
ſome Remarks upon the Antient, and <hi>much Celebrated</hi> Sybils.</p>
               <p>And that it was the uſual Compella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Ignorant Antients gave to their <hi>Familiars, Spirits,</hi> or <hi>Genii,</hi> to call them <hi>Gods,</hi> none need doubt who have read what is related of the Pythoneſs of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> in the Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> where ſhe replies to King <hi>Saul, I ſee</hi> Gods <hi>coming up out of the Earth.</hi> So in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.21. The <hi>Syrians</hi> ſpeak of the <hi>Gods</hi> of the <hi>Hills,</hi> add of the <hi>Valleys,</hi> by which it is evident they reckon'd thoſe Daemons which uſed to ſhew themſelves unto them in thoſe places to be Gods; nay, the Idolatrous Gentiles paid an Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to them.</p>
               <p>No wonder then if the <hi>Sybils</hi> obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their name from an apprehenſion that they had Communion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the Gods; for ſo it is thought the words <hi>Sios</hi> and <hi>Beel</hi> do import. It always hath been, and ſtill is, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of all Nations to affix ſomething of a ſacred and venerable Title or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter on perſons they have eſteemed to be Inſpired, or in favour with their <hi>Gods,</hi> and that even amongſt the moſt uncultivated <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>Sybils</hi> did generally by their Raptures and Enthuſiaſms promote and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48378:57"/>
encourage an Affiance in, and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Heathen Oracles and Idols, none need doubt who have ſeen the Account <hi>Zozimus</hi> gives of them; who particularly relates many of their Verſes full of Superſtitions and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having no affinity at all with the holy Religion, but tending to advance the Credit of their Pagan Shrines.</p>
               <p>The Learned <hi>Wierius</hi> in his Book <hi>de Praeſtigiis Daemonum, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. reckons moſt of the <hi>Sybils</hi> to be no better than <hi>Futhuſiaſtae,</hi> and <hi>Pythoniſtae,</hi> and amongſt the number of ſuch againſt whom the mighty Prophet <hi>Moſes</hi> made a Law, that thoſe who reſorted to them, ſhould be ſtoned; and he is farther of Opinion, that through their Writings the Frantick <hi>Romans</hi> were drawn into many of their Extatick and Superſtitious purſuits of their multiplied Deities. And although ſome extraordinary Prophecies relating to the Birth of the Glorious Meſſiah, are to be found in ſome of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, yet will not thoſe excuſe the groſs <hi>Daemonolatry</hi> of the reſt, any more than that Praediction of the <hi>Delphick</hi> Oracle before cited can be ſuppoſed to Atone for the wretched Derelictions of the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Holy God,</hi> occaſioned by the Libidinous queſt of the Nations
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48378:57"/>
after that Idol. Beſides, we have no mention made ſo much as of one of them in the Holy Regiſter, tho their Writings had a Date long before the Records of the Bleſſed Evangeliſts and Apoſtles. Nor need it be thought ſtrange that an <hi>Elogy</hi> in praiſe of our Saviour, ſhould come from the Pen of a <hi>Pagan</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Propheteſs, more than that <hi>an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment that he was the Son of God,</hi> ſhould be proclaimed by the mouth of the Father of Lies, and the promoter of falſe Gods himſelf; who hath been compelled by the irreſiſtible power of Divine Truth to pay that Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Soveraign of all. Or, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Divine Praedictions attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, were properly their own, or the Works of others of later Date, and pretended to be theirs, ſhall not be my task here to determine. They were generally Prieſts Conſecrated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> or the <hi>Delphick,</hi> or ſome other Oracle; and in furious Raptures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their Prophecies. <hi>Plato</hi> was of opinion that they were Inſpired by the Gods, or ſome Spirit. And <hi>Jambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Sybil</hi> of <hi>Delphos</hi> two ſeveral ways received her Inſpirations, either by a ſoft breath which came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her whilſt ſhe was, or ſeemed to be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48378:58"/>
in a Trance or Extaſie; or elſe by ſitting on a <hi>Tripod</hi> of Braſs, before the mouth of a Cave, from whence proceeded Fire, or a whiſpering Voice, upon which ſhe either reſolved the queſtions demanded of her, or uttered her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies. See <hi>Heywoods</hi> Hiſt. of Women, p. 78.</p>
               <p>To theſe reſorted the great Captains, to know the Fate of their Wars; the Country-man to enquire of the Fertility of the enſuing Seaſon; and others ſought their direction in Emergent caſes. They appointed where Temples and Altars ſhould be reared, and when their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were to be obſerved: And altho according to the Language of thoſe times, all Females (as there were then many) that were rapt with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Fury were called <hi>Sybils</hi>; yet our Modern Authors have reduc'd the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to ten, or twelve, becauſe to them peculiarly are attributed thoſe prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions concerning the Evangelical times. They are thus named <hi>Sybilla Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica,</hi> called <hi>Antiquiſſima Vaticinantium</hi>; She is ſaid to have divided the term of years until the coming of Chriſt into ſeven Ages, reckoning the firſt from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah</hi> 1556 years, and from the Flood to <hi>Abraham</hi> 292; from the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48378:58"/>
time of <hi>Abraham</hi> to the Children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> coming from <hi>Egypt</hi> 503. from that time to the building the Temple by King <hi>Solomon</hi> 481; and from thence to the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity 1800 years; and from thence to the Birth of our Saviour the number of 614 years; which being added together, with the number of years, ſince the Redemption by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Immaculate High Prieſt, makes the number of <hi>Six thouſand nine hundred and thirty years,</hi> which comes within 48 years of the <hi>Roman</hi> Account; whereas by the Scripture reckoning it will amount to but <hi>Five thouſand ſix hundred thirty and three years.</hi> So that upon the whole we ſee the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Prieſt keeps a nearer touch with the Prieſt of <hi>Apollo,</hi> than the Sacred Chronicle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Was called <hi>Sybilla Lybica</hi>; and a great diſpute there is whether ſhe or the forenamed were the more Antient.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Was <hi>Sybilla Delphica,</hi> ſhe is ſaid to have propheſied of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War.</p>
               <p>This by ſome is affirmed to be that <hi>Daphne</hi> whom <hi>Ovid</hi> feigns in his <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> to be changed into a Laurel, to avoid the embraces of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi>; and if we can credit their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, we ſhall find the Delphick

               <p n="4">4.

               <p>The Apoſtate Angel was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to have his <hi>Altars</hi> advanced, his <hi>Oracles</hi> ſought unto, his <hi>Idols</hi> Adored, his <hi>Prieſts</hi> had in Admiration among the Great and Pompous Eaſtern, and Weſtern <hi>Monarchies</hi>: But he hath <hi>ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> the remote <hi>Indians</hi> with his foul and contagious Worſhip; and with the help of his more Pagan Prieſts, and Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, enſlaved thoſe Barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to a Diabolical Adoration of his horrid Shrines. Sometimes they Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and ſupplicate unto his Image in the moſt foul and monſtrous Figure; ſometimes he perſonally appears unto them, and frights them into a Panick Adoration of his Tremendous Deity: Oftentimes he ſcares them with dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Apparitions in the Air, which he rends with violent Tempeſts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire, and frequently miſchiefs
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48378:62"/>
them, not only in their Fields, but in their perſons too, which occaſions their ſupplicating him to avert his Terrours from them. The Hiſtories of <hi>America</hi> give a large account of the many ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they are drawn into by this their Infernal Deity, who ſeems to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Perſonal Empire, and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt them.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtory of <hi>Perſia</hi> gives a large Relation of the many monſtrous Idols, and Pagods, to which that People pay Divine Worſhip, and Adoration, to ſome of which they offer their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by way of <hi>Immolation,</hi> as the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old did unto their Monſter <hi>Moloch.</hi> To ſome of their Idols they proſtitute their Daughters, whom they reckon not fit for the Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Rites, until they have permitted a penetration of their Bodies, by the wanton Member of their Beaſtly Idol: <hi>Or rather ſome ſordid and laſcivious Spirit, that ſometimes actuates it from within.</hi> See <hi>Herberts Travels,</hi> which I take it, gives a particular, and diſtinct account of theſe, and divers other Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among them.</p>
               <p>Nor have the Inhabitants of <hi>China,</hi> and the Eaſtern <hi>India,</hi> eſcaped the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>Devil-Worſhip.</hi> For <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand

Mendez Pinto,</hi> a <hi>Portuguize,</hi> who Travelled many years amongſt them, hath very largely ſet forth the many Idolatries and Superſtitions of that people: They have amongſt them a vaſt number of Prieſts, which they have in high veneration; and a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious accumulation of Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. And though the <hi>Turks</hi> in their extended Empire do forbid the uſe of Idols, yet we find in <hi>Knowles</hi> his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them, that they have amongſt their Prieſts abundance of <hi>Conjurers,</hi> which they call <hi>Wiſe,</hi> or <hi>Cunning Men,</hi> by which they maintain a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the black Inhabitants of the Infernal World: So that, tho they do not permit the uſe of the more lawful and liberal Studies, they yet give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to be Scholars, and Diſciples to the moſt interdicted Myſteries.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Lappland</hi> they maintain ſuch an ordinary Correſpondence with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed Spirits, that a <hi>Lappland Witch</hi> is almoſt grown to a Proverb with us: And though it be common amongſt the Inhabitants to <hi>Converſe,</hi> and <hi>Revel</hi> with their <hi>Daemons,</hi> and <hi>Familiars</hi>; yet the <hi>Prieſts</hi> among them generally acquire a dexterity in the <hi>Art</hi> above what the reſt can pretend to: So that they do as

               <p>There was in the year 1677. or 78. a Book printed, Intituled, <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Lappland, which gives a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their many Methods of raiſing their <hi>Spirits</hi>; and of divers forms and ſhapes, in which they ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſhewed themſelves to their <hi>Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators,</hi> and converſed with them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like a <hi>Satyr,</hi> ſometimes in the likeneſs of a Man: and there is amongſt them ſuch a kind of <hi>Familiarity</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as if they were of the ſame <hi>Country,</hi> and <hi>Deſcent.</hi> Amongſt the many ways they have to call the Spirits to their Attendance, none is more in uſe then that of a <hi>Magical</hi> Drum they have, and in great eſteem amongſt them; they are very well deſcribed in the Book above mentioned, and I have lately ſeen one of thoſe Drums in <hi>Greſham Colledge</hi>; it is all over marked upon the vellam with a ſort of <hi>Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick</hi> Characters, ſomewhat like the Arabick letters; but doubtleſs a ſort of Orthography, taught by the <hi>Black Maſter</hi> of the Infernal Science.

and Incantations,) the Spirit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently attends, and either anſwers to what is demanded, <hi>out of the Drum,</hi> or elſe appears in ſome form in a place aſſigned him, and there reſolves the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for which he was invocated. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, amongſt all Hiſtorians, that the people of <hi>Lappland</hi> ſell <hi>Winds</hi> to Merchants for certain Voyages; by which they much enrich themſelves.

of divers of them, who ſtand Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for Conjurers, and ſuch as have had Familiarity with the Devil.

               <p>By this ſhort, yet <hi>dreadful</hi> Liſt, it may appear by what degrees, firſt Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then Idolatry, and after that <hi>Daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolatry,</hi> or a Correſpondence, if not a <hi>Confederacy</hi> with the <hi>Prince of Darkneſs,</hi> crept into the world; nay, that part of it that <hi>claims</hi> the name of an <hi>Apoſtolick Church:</hi> Tho nothing more <hi>contrary,</hi> or

rather Diametrically oppoſite to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> eſtabliſhed by the Holy Jeſus, and his bleſſed Apoſtles. The Heathen Oracles had been ſtruck dumb by the coming of the Eternal Redeemer, and the Divine Miracles wrought by him in <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel</hi>; the Magicians, and Sorcerers confounded by the Sacred Authority derived to the conſtituted Apoſtles, as we find recorded in <hi>their Acts,</hi> in the caſes of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi>Elimas</hi> the <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> with divers others of that kind: But after the Chriſtian Doctrine had been confirmed by ſo many, and unqueſtionable Divine Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſo that there wanted nothing that might aſſure the World of the mighty hand of God that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his <hi>Miniſters</hi> in their firſt planting the Goſpel of Salvation: Then again do we find the <hi>Arch-Enemy</hi> of our Souls <hi>unchained,</hi> and we may well calculate his loſing from the time of <hi>Stephen</hi> the third, which was that fatal period that again ſpread the <hi>foul Contagion</hi> over the <hi>Apostate Church</hi>: For now the <hi>myſtery</hi> of <hi>Iniquity</hi> ſhewed itſelf in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and the <hi>old Serpent</hi> began again to be Worſhipped as God, and <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ words">

I ſhall therefore make bold to cite ſome paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges out of the fore-named book of that excellent Authors, in <hi>refutation</hi> of the pretended <hi>Roman</hi> Miracles.</p>

                  <q>
                     <p>to be tryed by the true Church, as we find it in the Scriptures: and not the Church by theſe Miracles.</p>
                     <p>Bring <hi>Roman</hi> Miracles to this Rule, you may divide them into three Ranks; for ſome of them are but meer Tales; ſome are counterfeit Impoſtures, and Artificial tricks of Juglers: others have a real Being, but the Queſtion is, <hi>whence</hi> they have it.</p>
                     <p>As for the firſt ſort of Miracles: The Papiſts have by little and little, heaped them to ſuch an extravagancy, that divers of their Communion, who have ſome Modeſty left them, can ſcarce forbear bluſhing at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (if the four Books of Dialogues be truly his) did begin pretty well to tell ſtories: but theſe are nothing to the advances made by other <hi>Prelates,</hi> and great <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors, in the following Ages: And I may ſay confidently that theſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts are not much ſhort of the moſt extravagant Romancers. There you ſhall read of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Leper, and transferring his <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire upon that Pope that made him clean, of Wolves, and Lyons bringing back Lambs, and reſtoring

them out of their Entrails, after they had torn them to pieces; of Birds flocking about to hear Sermons; and of <hi>Aſſes</hi> becoming <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> at leaſt kneeling to adore the Maſs-Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They cannot conceive any <hi>great man</hi> to be a Saint, unleſs he hath an extraordinary gift for the working of ſuch Miracles. How true they be, you may beſt learn of the very Saints, who deny them: As for Example, S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and yet they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon them: And you can hardly paſs for a true Catholick, unleſs you believe that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> was ſaluted, and <hi>ſuckled</hi> ſeveral times by our Lady in her Image; that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> did <hi>Raiſe the dead,</hi> did cure all ſorts of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable diſeaſes</hi>; and had every night St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf whiſpering in his Ear, what he did write on his Epiſtles. And as to St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, he had no meaner whiſperer then the Holy Ghoſt in Perſon, under the ſhape of a Pigeon ſitting quietly upon his head, and ſometimes ſtretching down her Bill into his Mouth, when he was Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. And we know that the <hi>Grand Impoſtor, Mahomet,</hi> pretended ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the like about the ſame time.

Now you may be ſure all theſe things are Fabulous, ſince diſowned by the very men who are pretended to have had them, and who therefore knew beſt the truth of all theſe <hi>works,</hi> and aſſiſtances.</p>
                     <p>Much like to theſe are the Miracles of <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> when he <hi>cures Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> in their Travail, if you but ſet his Seal, or Signet on their Belly; when he makes the houſe where he happens to be, horribly ſhake; and when himſelf grows as <hi>hot,</hi> and as <hi>terrible</hi> as Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> by the fierce motion of that Spirit, which from a <hi>debauch'd Soldier,</hi> made him a holy <hi>Jeſuit</hi>: or when he ſees the Soul of his deareſt Friend <hi>Hoſius</hi> mounting up into the Sky, far more gorgeous then the Soul of any other: or when he works greater Miracles with his own name in a little piece of paper, <hi>Cum nomine ſuo Chartae inſcripto,</hi> then <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Apoſtles did in <hi>Gods name. We cannot deny</hi> (ſays the Biſhop of <hi>Canaries) but ſometimes very grave men write, and leave to poſterity ſuch reports about Saints Miracles, humouring hereby both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the people, whom they perceive both prone to believe, and importunate to have them do ſo.</hi>

And is it not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by evident to all that will not wilfully blind themſelves to their own deluſion, that theſe Stories, if true, are no other than Diabolical Cheats; being ſuch, as in no wiſe can be imagined to confirm the Evangelical Doctrine, but rather the Superſtitions and Orders by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, impoſed upon the world: Or if they are not true, then may we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them to fall within the number of thoſe <hi>lying Wonders</hi> foretold of in the Scripture, by which Antichriſt ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to eſtabliſh his <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a <hi>Credulous,</hi> and <hi>Bigotted</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

               <p>Let us now go on to the ſecond ſort of Miracles mentioned by Dr. <hi>Brevint,</hi> which are ſuch as are made up all of Artifice, and Impoſture.
<q>Pope <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> in this matter once behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like a man, when through a Pipe or Sarbutane, he conveyed ſo dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly this Oracle, <hi>Caeleſtin, get thee away, if thou haſt a mind to be ſaved</hi>; that Pope <hi>Caleſtin</hi> took it, it ſeems, notwithſtanding his Infallibility, for an Angelical Warning, and ſo left the Popedom to the Cheat. Pope <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand</hi> had once another as good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Cheating, but as it was much more Cruel, it had not ſo happy a ſucceſs, when he had ready a huge ſtone, which ſhould have fallen from a high Vault, <hi>like a Judgment out of Heaven,</hi> upon the head of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Henry</hi> the third, when at his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions; but the poor Wretch, who was employed in that good affair, made too much haſt, for he fell down with his great Stone, wherewith he was cruſht all to pieces, before the Emperour came under that place,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48378:70"/>
where he uſed to kneel at prayer. It was a pretty trick of the Country Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, (mentioned by Card. <hi>Benno,</hi>) who getting Crabs, with little Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles faſtened to their backs, ſet them a crawling up and down his Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard at night; and perſuaded his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the morning, after he had taken them in again, <hi>that they were poor diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Souls, which wanted Maſſes.</hi> Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Crucifixes <hi>have been found</hi> very commodious for working this kind of Miracles, eſpecially when they are ſet up cloſe to thick walls, as the <hi>great Serapis</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was once, for then 'tis an eaſy matter to get up behind by ſecret ways, to anoint the face of the Saint, and to put in a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing diſh, that ſhall make him both <hi>ſweat</hi> and <hi>weep,</hi> by heating, and melting that liquour. Springs, and Wheels; and ſuch like Engines, are of great uſe to make them move, and bow, and ſpeak;</q> by ſuch a Miracle the Marrie, Prieſts unhappily loſt their good cauſe once at <hi>Wincheſter</hi>; <q>for when they were upon the point of winning it, a <hi>Crucifix ſtarted at it,</hi> and declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prieſts.</q>

                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:48378:71"/>
So either ſimple were the Men, or ſtrong the Impoſtors of thoſe days; nor are they now much leſs in many places. Although <hi>Syranus</hi> tells all the World, <hi>That great deluſions are often put upon the People by Maſs-priests, and their counterfeited Wonders and Signs.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But the third and laſt ſort of <hi>Roman</hi> Miracles reckoned up by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Learned Author, are thoſe that indeed come neareſt to our purpoſe, and do unqueſtionably prove, that as the Heathens of old under the Images of <hi>Serapis, Molech, Baalim,</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. worſhipped baſe and infernal Spirits; ſo the Romaniſts now adays, (though they have new dreſſed and inſcribed their Idols) do no leſs than pay an Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Apoſtate Angels, and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Spirits, which <hi>Act in,</hi> and <hi>Actuate</hi> thoſe Interdicted Images.</p>

                  <q>
                     <p>For my part (<hi>ſays he</hi>) when I do read in grave and famous <hi>Roman</hi> Writers, that a Conſecrated Hoſt will flie and flutter in the Air ſometimes, till a Maſs-Prieſt holds up his Pix to receive it; that ſhapes of Fleſh and Young Children have appeared upon their Altars, at the Elevation of the ſaid Hoſt; that by many good Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, Horſes, and Mules, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48378:71"/>
Cows, have been cured of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, when ſome Maſſes were ſung for them to the honour of S. <hi>Barbara</hi>; that S. <hi>Dominick</hi> did write Books, which upon ſeveral Tryals no Fire could ever burn; that once he was ſeen perfectly in the ſhape of a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix, with the five wounds in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and a Crown of Thorns on his Head, That at the Conſecration at Maſs, ſomething like Chriſt was ſeen hard by him, with the ſame ſigns of his cruel Paſſion, dropping out of his own wounds ſome of his own dear Blood on this dear Saint; that the B. Virgin beheld all this, and of her own accord plaid the Maſs-prieſt, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred the <hi>very Body</hi> of her Son, in one moity of a Conſecrated Wafer to this ſame Saint in token of ſpecial friendſhip; and all this averred, and ſworn as true, by a formal Oath in the name of the Bleſſed Trinity, and under pain of all kinds of Gods Curſes, in caſe of a <hi>lie</hi> or a <hi>miſtake,</hi> with five hundred ſuch and greater Marvels: I think it a kinder, and ſafer part in me to take them for ſomething, then for meer Tales.</p>
                     <p>But for my pains of believing ſo, let me, who by Gods Grace am a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48378:72"/>
Proteſtant, have the liberty which the Papiſts allow themſelves, when they controul what is done by Pagans; to ſay, as perhaps it is true, that when the Emperour <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> once cured a Blind and Lame man, <hi>It was the Devil, who hindring the ſight of the one, and the motion of the other, ſeemed really to heal both, when really he did but ceaſe from hurting and anoying them.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Papiſts will come ſo far, as to ſuſpect their own Miracles, and to take them but for ſportings of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and wicked Spirits; and for this he quotes <hi>Biel in Canon. lect.</hi> 51. Thoſe ordinary ſhews of a young Child, or of a Man of compleat ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that appear ſometimes, as they ſay, among their holieſt Myſteries, and upon the Fiſts of their beſt Prieſts. They might as well, if their Intereſt would ſuffer it, find the like flaws in all the reſt, and you may eaſily do it, if you compare their own Roman, with all averred Chriſtian Miracles.</p>

               <p>I fear there may be ſome will think I have been too long in this tranſcript; but if they conſider the conſiſtence of the Argument, and upon what great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it is deduced, will find no reaſon to complain: And I could heartily wiſh that

every <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſt had before him thoſe Books to peruſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, out of which our Author makes his Citations; I ſhould think it impoſſible but the Opinion, and Authority of thoſe of their <hi>own Religion,</hi> muſt certainly prevail with ſome of them, that are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous, at leaſt not to pin their Faith upon the <hi>Traditions</hi> of ſome of their <hi>over-ſuperſtitious</hi> Fathers, but I muſt again return, and go on with our Excellent Author, to obſerve how the <hi>Roman</hi> Miracles diſtinguiſh themſelves from thoſe of our Bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles: And here he admirably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes,

                  <q>As to the firſt black Character (<hi>he ſays</hi>) whereas the Ancient Miracles of God are <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>ſerious</hi> Works, and do carry along with them both ſome Image of Gods Wiſdom, and ſome holy Impreſſion of the Divine Hand that cauſes them: The Modern and Roman Miracles are commonly ſuch <hi>Sports</hi> and <hi>Pranks,</hi> as can become but Fairies, and Hobgoblins. What is there in the whole World more Impertinent then to make the moſt Bleſſed and Holy Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> come purpoſely out of Heaven, whence it was not heard ſhe came before, to drudge here and there about Monks, about ſick Wives, about Images and ſuch like things? Who could take for a holy Soul or a good Angel (much leſs for that ever bleſſed Saint) that which appears under her name like a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhewing her <hi>Breaſt, embracing</hi> men, giving them <hi>Suck, enticing</hi> them with her <hi>Favours,</hi> Hoods, Veſts, and ſometimes <hi>fine Rings</hi> which ſhe makes for them of <hi>her own Hairs.</hi>
                  </q>
To ſuch purpoſe ſhe is ſaid to have brought

down her Heavenly train, and to have ſat in S. <hi>Ildephons</hi>'s own Throne, whilſt thouſands of her Virgins ſtood ſinging about her, and about the reading Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit; and all this great appearance to Compliment the Biſhop, and preſent him with a <hi>White Robe,</hi> which ſhe ſaid ſhe had taken out of her Sons <hi>Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe</hi>; and it was to be worn only upon her days; and all this becauſe the Eye of his Faith was continually bent to her Service; (for this is the beſt Eye of Roman Faith) he was to wear it in that Church, and after to have joy in her Cloſet or Apartment, <hi>in Promptua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis meis.</hi> This Gown is ſhewn at <hi>Toledo.</hi>

Sons dirty lying (if there be ſuch a thing as Tranſubſtantiation, it muſt be ſo) ſhe held the Chalice to take both the Wafers and her Son in it. <hi>Then the Queen of Heaven,</hi> ſays the Hiſtorian, <hi>takes up theſe vomited Wafers,</hi> and waſhes them clean with great care, and lays them up reverently on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</p>
               <p>Abundance more of <hi>Feats</hi> he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons up reported in the Roman Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and Authors of the ſame Spirit, which they would perſwade their blinded Bigots to be the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; as her going to <hi>Orleance</hi> with a Box of Ointment, to dreſs the back of a Dean; giving ſpecial Pills to a Monk to purge his Choler; feeding S. <hi>Albert,</hi> with a ſort of Bread, after which he reſolv'd to feed on nought but Herbs and Roots: Coming (they ſay) down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but more likely from the power of the Air, to uncover her breaſts, and put her Paps into the Mouth of S. <hi>Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> and S. <hi>Bernard</hi>; then they make her to woo Sweet-hearts, and give them Rings of her own Hair, as to S. <hi>Alan,</hi> and S. <hi>Harman,</hi> to both which they ſay ſhe was married, and that in the preſence of all her Saints, (Spirits like her ſelf relating a thouſand other ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,

               <p>Then they bring down (whom they would impoſe upon us to be the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of the Father) lying as if dead under the hand of a Maſs-prieſt, or ſhewing tricks of Activity, like a young Child among the Novices, in their Churches and Covents:</p>
               <p>One ſays, he hath ſeen <hi>this little Child</hi> creeping out at the mouth of a Crucifix ('tis all a Sparrow could do, but the Devil can do much more) and thence jump into the Lap of an Image, thence fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up again the way that he came. Another ſays S. <hi>Ida</hi> had him, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and embraced him, <hi>ut ſponſa ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum</hi>; then he muſt hang about her Neck whilſt ſhe ſings an Anthem; S. <hi>Agnes</hi> had him too, whilſt ſhe ſtole a little <hi>Croſs</hi> out of his boſom: They ſay he was brought by his own Mother, to be kiſſed by S. <hi>Catharine,</hi> of the order of <hi>Clara</hi> upon a Chriſtmas Eve; and that the ſame Dame brought him to Bed to <hi>S.

They will have it, that S. <hi>Lucia</hi> of the order of S. <hi>Dominick</hi> had him three Days and three Nights, during which time the Image of the Virgin had no Baby on its left Arm; after that, they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48378:75"/>
marry him to her, when he looked as if he had been but ſeven years old. S. <hi>Hostradus</hi> and others took this illuſion for a real appearance of the Holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and thereupon offered him as we do Children, ſomething to eat; ſome would dandle him on their Knees, and others play with him, and S. <hi>John,</hi> who was his companion at it.</p>
               <p>Thus, with grief, may pious Souls ſee according to the Propheſies, Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>trodden and danced upon by ugly Owls and wild Satyrs.</hi> Iſa. 13.21. So the Roman Church is become a Stage for vile Spirits to act upon; for where are the good Saints or Angels that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, much leſs <hi>act</hi> Chriſt and the Bleſſed Virgin, under ſuch ſhameful perſonages?</p>
               <p>Then as for S. <hi>Francis,</hi> you have Sheep and Aſſes running to hear his Sermons; Swine falling dead under his curſe, for having hurt a poor Lamb; all ſorts of Cattel recover with the Water he waſht his Feet in; Women eaſed of their <hi>Travel</hi> by applying to them ſome of the Hay his Mule uſed to eat of.</p>
               <p>Again, you may find S. <hi>Dominick</hi> at Maſs, hanging in the Air like a Bird; or at the Bed-ſide of a ſick Woman
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48378:75"/>
Tranſubſtantiating Worms into Pearls; or by the Water ſide, raiſing the River into a Flood; or at his Devotions, <hi>forcing the Devil to hold Candle to him, 'till the poor pugg burn his own Fingers in the Service:</hi> Or, ſometimes you may find him changing the ſex of a young Girl unto a Boy.</p>
               <p>Nor did the Women come behind hand for extraordinary feaſts; for if you read but the Life of S. <hi>Christina,</hi> you will find that ſhe roſe from the dead twice, before ſhe died for good and all, and ſo died thrice. She had a mighty knack at Miracles all her life long; for to ſave Souls from the pains of Purgatory, ſhe loved to throw her ſelf into all the hotteſt Ovens, and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fires ſhe could find, that ſhe might endure here what they ſuffered there; and to atone for Gluttons, ſhe reſolv'd to ſtarve her ſelf, till finding the pains of a ſharp hunger, ſhe had Milk came into her Paps, ſo allayed the cravings of her Stomach, by ſucking her ſelf; ſhe expiated for proud Souls, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf to the worſt way of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> begging; ſhe could diſtinguiſh too between the honeſty and diſhoneſty of thoſe which gave her alms, for the Bread that came from good hands taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48378:76"/>
like Bread, but that which came from wicked hands taſted like Toads-fleſh. To ſatisfy for all Sorts of ſins contracted by thoſe which uſed much company keeping, ſhe reſolv'd to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake mankind, and to come near none but Beaſts; at laſt that ſhe might be ſafe from all contagion of Fleſh and Blood, ſhe parched her ſelf on the tops of Trees; there her thin body being made thinner, both by continual faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and great fervency of Spirit, ſhe did at her prayer contract her ſelf into a round form, much like that of a Hedg-hog. She could climb up the higheſt Trees like a Squirrel, and ſwim in Rivers like a Fiſh; till her Friends, barbarous, it ſeems, and not believing all theſe Miracles, put her in Chains as a Mad Woman; and there ſhe miſerably lacerated her poor body with ſtruggling hard to free her ſelf; and this violence in Priſon gave occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to more Miracles, for the Milk in her Breaſts turned into Oyl, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe did anoint her ſores, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too, ſhe uſed it as Butter to ſweeten her Bread. Cardinals and whole Towns can aver theſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies, and therewith we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the firſt kind of Roman Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;

               <head type="sub">A further evidence of the Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Roman Prieſts with evil Spirits.</head>
               <p>THE Argument that we are now upon, having already taken up too much Paper for one Section, I have thought it proper to continue it in the following Chapter, leſt, <hi>thoſe who are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Satans devices, and of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of his Priests,</hi> ſhould want ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing a Demonſtration of <hi>the danger of Communion with them,</hi> as is laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in the ſubſequent lines. I muſt therefore reſume the Diſcourſe as it is continued in the forecited Book of the Reverend Dr. <hi>Brevint</hi>; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already tranſcribed the ſum of what he ſpeaks upon the firſt Head, namely, <hi>That the Miracles of the Roman
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48378:77"/>
Church, are ordinary, ſuch trifling, and Ludicrous pranks, as cannot poſſibly ſeem to hold any proportion with thoſe ſolid and Divine Operations, which atteſted the Truth and Excellency of the Doctrine of the Holy Goſpel</hi>: The Second Evidence that he mentions is, the <hi>Tendency</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> of the Popiſh Miracles; which look quite another way from thoſe wrought by our Bleſſed Saviour, and his Apoſtles: For whereas thoſe laſt confirmed the Faith, and Doctrine of the firſt Preachers of the Doctrine of Salvation; and thoſe which anciently were wrought at the Sepulchres of the Primitive Martyrs, cannot be thought to juſtify or <hi>aſſert</hi> any other <hi>Faith,</hi> or Doctrine than what was <hi>Taught, Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> and <hi>Practiſed</hi> by thoſe <hi>Holy Men; Aug. de Civit.</hi> l. 22. c. 9. ſays, <hi>What is it that theſe Miracles will attest but the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Christ?</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that they taught nothing, but what was concluded within the Law and the Prophets; and it cannot be ſuppoſed that the extraordinary things done by them ſhould confirm any other Doctrine than what they <hi>Taught.</hi> So at this day, tho all ſorts of Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were to be ſeen at the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of St. <hi>Paul</hi>; they could not be
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48378:78"/>
preſumed to confirm the Popes Bulls, or the <hi>Innovations</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but thoſe truths which were contained in his Preachings, and his Epiſtles. But as for <hi>Roman</hi> Miracles, they follow their Novel Doctrines, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are contrary to, and always quite different from the true Chriſtian Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. How many Volumes would be required to contain all the revelations, and the ſtrange wonders, that encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and excite men in general to the Worſhip of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more are beſtowed upon the doing it by ſpecial ways, and at her particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Feaſts; for upon that ſcore great Indulgences are promiſed to her Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; or elſe what mean thoſe ſwarms of Monks that lie hid under her Coats, or the Ladders whited with her Milk, from which no body (that takes that way to Heaven) can ever tumble down? Or thoſe Quires of ſuppoſed Angels heard in the bottom of a deep Well to ſing her praiſes? What can be thought of thoſe Images that bleed, or ſpeak, or fly as light as Feathers, unleſs it be to bring mankind to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Wood, or Stone, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſordid and abominable, which ſeems to give motion to thoſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48378:78"/>
inanimate Stocks? What all thoſe thouſands of ſad Souls to ramble up and down the World, ſince the time of Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> but to reveal Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and recommend Maſſes for the dead? What abundance of ſtrange Feats have been done by St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and St. <hi>Dominic,</hi> on purpoſe to confirm their new orders, and ways? What can ſignify thoſe heaps of excommunicated Flies; and a poor Raven pining to death under the ſame Curſe, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fled away with a Biſhops Ring, but to ſhew the Terrour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Keys? And thoſe multitude of ſmall and great Toads crawling in and out of mens mouths, when they do obſerve well or ill the rules of Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but to juſtify that jugling piece of Prieſt-Craft? Or the many little Children ſtanding upon conſecrated Wafers, but to maintain the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation? What can the many pretended Miracles wrought by the five wounds in the body of St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> or the Rope about his Loyns ſignify, but to keep up an Opinion of the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Order? Then the Doctor asks your Opinion of the following Miracle, which he thus relates.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:48378:79"/>A Biſhop moved with paſſion againſt a Covent of <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> was reſolved to turn them out of his City, and to do it the next day: The night before, behold their Sacriſt ſees in a viſion the Image of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Image of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> both painted in the Church window, talking earneſtly one with the other. He hears St. <hi>Paul</hi> extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blaming St. <hi>Francis</hi> for no better defending his own Order; and St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> anſwering to him, <hi>What ſhall I do?</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have but a Croſs, and that is no defenſive Weapon; but had I a ſword, as you have</hi> (for commonly they repreſent them ſo) <hi>perhaps I might do ſomewhat more.</hi> The man being awak'd, ſtarts out of his bed, and his imagination being full of this, runs to the Church, finds the two Pictures had exchanged their Arms: <hi>Paul</hi> in the window had the Croſs, and St. <hi>Francis</hi> had the Sword.</p>
               <p>This amaz'd the whole Covent; but that which is more then all the reſt, St. <hi>Francis</hi> had not St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Sword in vain, for that ſame night the Biſhop had his throat cut. What Evangelical Doctrine can be confirmed by theſe three Wonders? Pictures that can ſpeak and move; St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that exhorts
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48378:79"/>
to revenge; and a Saint, who during his life, made Conſcience, as they ſay, to kill a Louſe, now can cut his Biſhops throat: What can be infer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d from this, unleſs it be this wholſome Doctrine, that Biſhops are not <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> but <hi>Friers</hi> are? All theſe, and whole Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of other ſuch <hi>Roman</hi> Miracles, are not fit for Chriſts Calendar, becauſe they never were accommodated for perſuading men of the truth of Chriſts Goſpel, and upon that account muſt needs proceed from any other than his Spirit.

                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:48378:80"/>The third foul mark he mentions of <hi>Roman</hi> Miracles, and which will put it beyond all doubt, that they are the effect of Diabolical Confederacies, and Impoſtures, is, that beſides the evil tendency of them, they appear, and ſhew themſelves unto the world in ſuch <hi>ſuſpicious times,</hi> as may juſtly diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and call in queſtion even true, and real Miracles. The gift of Miracles being unto Teachers, what credential Letters, and Royal Colours are unto publick Officers, which ſignify much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good Subjects, whilſt they know them granted to none but ſuch as the King doth really ſend; but very little, after they ſee thoſe in the hands, theſe on the backs of every dirty Carrier, who hath a mind for his own ends to Counterfeit them, and rant with them. No man takes for good payment what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath <hi>Caeſars Image,</hi> after he hears of falſe Coiners, who have diſperſed vaſt ſums abroad, and marked them with the ſame ſtamp We are not now in the priviledged days either of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Elias,</hi> or of Jeſus Chriſt, or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; when neither all the Magicians could make one Louſe; nor all the <hi>Baalims</hi> light fire on one Altar; nor all the workers of falſe wonders open
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48378:80"/>
their mouth againſt the Son of God. We live in ſuch times, when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in all mens account, are let looſe from ſuch a reſtraint, and the Church left unguarded of ſuch a protection: When falſe Prophets may ariſe with ſuch Propheſies, and falſe Chriſts with ſuch Miracles, as, if it were poſſible, <hi>might deceive the very Elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Mirabilarians,</hi> as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> calls them, are abroad, againſt whom, ſaies he, <hi>Cautum me fecit Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> The Lord himſelf, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles after him, have given us all ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient warning; ſo that it would be a great folly in us to take notice, or run after ſuch, as have a permitted power of Counterfeiting true Miracles, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to amuſe the ſimple. The glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work of our Bleſſed Saviour, his Diſciples, and other Apoſtolical Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, were done in ſuch clear days, as diſſipated, and ſcattered all ſuſpicions, and imaginable Clouds of Impoſture; the Devils had not ſo much as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to preach the Truth, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.25. If either <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or <hi>Elimas,</hi> tho Sorcerers of the higheſt rank, did but offer to play their old Game, and ſhew their deviliſh Feats, you read in the <hi>Acts,</hi> how they were kept in. Thus
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48378:81"/>
this mighty reſtraining hand, rather than the intrinſecal greatneſs of the work, was an infallible Evidence, which in thoſe days ſhined about all true Miracles; whereas the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Feats of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> muſt needs be full of ſuſpicion, and noted for ſuch by all good Chriſtians, ſince they came forth, when all falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets have the liberty to work them. Then come up the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions of ſad Souls, by thouſands, to acquaint their Friends with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition underneath: and what neither <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor the Prophets, nor Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, nor his Apoſtles ever thought to mind us of; diſtreſſed groaning Spirits make it their principal buſineſs to throng about, craving for help, for Pilgrimages, and Maſſes. Then come Images to bleed, or ſing or mourn, as occaſion requires: and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Elements, the better to juſtify what they are not, appear with blood, with fleſh, and even ſometimes with whole Children. It paſſes all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, how the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who kept her ſelf ſo long above, would not come down among us Mortals, either ſooner, or in leſs ſuſpected times, or on more ſerious Errands.

years may be accounted, when all good Authors will juſtify that ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as quiet above; and that ſhe, after ſo long reſt and abode in the bleſſed Manſions, ſhould take ſuch an unlucky, and obnoxious time to come down, and ſhew her ſelf to men, when the Devil, and his foul Spirits are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to play their pranks; this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is very admirable! It can hardly be imagined, that ſhe who never did appear to any of the Primitive Holy Fathers, in a leſs ſuſpected juncture, ſhould in theſe laſt and <hi>Branded</hi> times, ſhew her ſelf to a dirty Monk. Did not St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> before he died, being beſieged by <hi>Barbarians,</hi> deſerve as well her protection, and a guard of her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Angels, as St. <hi>Dominick</hi> did, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt he held a poor pitiful Heretick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the neck with his Roſary? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had none of theſe holy men, St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> St. <hi>Hillary,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> as well the comfort of a kiſs, or an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, as <hi>Loyola, Stephen</hi> the <hi>Minime,</hi> and a thouſand more leſs deſerving it? Or how comes ſhe, who never was known to take notice of any trouble, diſeaſe, or impriſonment of true Saints, as the Head-ach of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> the ſickli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> the infirm body of St.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48378:82"/>
                  <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> the Priſons, and Tortures of all the Martyrs; now to be running up and down to relieve all ſorts of perſons: to cure a Jeſuit with her Child, whom ſhe laid by him in his bed: to cure whole Countries of purple Feavers; and to free ſeveral Rogues, that had well deſerved hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from the Gallows, from Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and from all imaginable ſorts of dangers? How comes this fancy to take her ſo late of bringing down out of Heaven, Croſſes, Hoods, Books, Robes, Holy Water, and ſuch other Utenſils, which the Fathers in former times ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had, nor expected from her? The truth is, theſe kind of Apparitions and Miracles were moſt adviſedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved until ſuch times, as theſe latter are, dark, and confuſed, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to Impoſture; and theſe ſtrange new tranſactions have <hi>another reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,</hi> which I wiſh Roman-Catholicks would ſeriouſly conſider, and it is this.</p>
               <p>As long as the Bleſſed Virgin had no more honour in the Church, then what became a Creature, and was allowed to her by the Fathers, <hi>to be Honoured, not Adored</hi>; no Antient Author will tell you that ſhe ever appeared among men. But as ſoon as the latter times brought
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48378:82"/>
in publick Services to pray with unto her, and Images to pray to her by; then ſhe (or rather ſome other Spirit under her name) began firſt to beſtir her ſelf: then ſhe, and a multitude of other Saints with her, ſeem to come down, and appear at the voice of theſe new Prayers, juſt as the Soul of <hi>Samuel</hi> did, (or rather ſeemed to) come up at the <hi>Myſteries of</hi> Endor. Ever after the pretended Queen was ſeen in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, as in her Heavenly Palace: and ſhe had more Angels to wait on her in the leaſt of her ordinary Progreſſes, then our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf had in any of his moſt ſolemn appearings: But as when the Devils will look like Angels, you may ſtill, they ſay, either perceive a Cloven Foot, or ſmell a ſtinking vapour, that betrays the pretended glorious appearance, ſo <hi>Roman</hi> Miracles, and Viſions, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſome <hi>black mark,</hi> which may convince any ſober man, that they are not really what they ſeem to be. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in the Holy Scriptures what the true Saints and Angels of God have done, whenever they met with more Honour then was their due: or ask St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> what thoſe Spirits are, who take it when it is given, or call for it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48378:83"/>
when it is not: <hi>No Saint, nor Angel,</hi> ſays the good Father, <hi>will take of others what they know to be due only to God</hi>: as it appeared by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who tore their cloaths, when the people offered to worſhip them, to ſhew they <hi>were meer men:</hi> And by that <hi>Angel who rejected Adoration.</hi> They are unclean Spirits that are for Worſhip, and tho they care little for fleſh; yet they pride themſelves in Sacrifices, becauſe God, under the Law, appointed them for his own ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in another place he ſays, <hi>Good Angels are for this one thing, that with them we may ſerve God, in whoſe contemplation they are happy: but they who invite us to ſerve themſelves, are like proud men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>only the ſerving of proud Devils is more hurtful.</hi> And in another place he ſays, <hi>Coeleſtial, and happy Spirits will have us Sacrifice (not unto themſelves, but) unto God, whoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation they are, as well as we; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all Revelations, and Miracles that invite us to ſerve more than one God, are ſuch ſeductions of Devils, as any pious, and prudent men muſt needs throw off; for this is their proud Malice, who by that To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken are noted, neither to be good Angels themſelves, nor the Angels of a good God. For the good Angels love us ſo well, that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48378:83"/>
they will not have us to ſerve them, but the true God only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Opinion of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his time, by which it appears what his thoughts were of Saint, and Idol-Adoration. Let us now bring to theſe Chriſtian Rules, moſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Miracles, and Apparitions. Let us ſee when ever this <hi>humble Spirit</hi> did (with the good Angel) reject one Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or devout Adoration; ſhew, wherever ſhe once tore her cloaths at the hearing of <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and the whole Pſalter of <hi>David</hi> ſung, and applied moſt Blaſphemouſly from <hi>God</hi> to <hi>her.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that for ſeveral Centuries of years, the ſteps of another Spirit are to be found in her ways, ſeeking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually for more honour. We may behold one who ſtrokes, and kiſſes pious men, becauſe they both begin and end their beſt devotions with her prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: who teaches in what godly form they muſt pray to her for all Bleſſings: who calls them into brakes of Thorns, and Nettles, and ſometimes into holes under ground, to find, and Adore her Images: one who can put on the ſhape of a Stag, or a Pigeon, or a great Queen, purpoſely to ſhew the place, and ſtone where ſhe muſt needs have an Altar, or
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48378:84"/>
a Chappel, or a great Church that there ſhe may be ſerved and Worſhipped to the worlds end; and there walk, and delight her ſelf; one who in all theſe Churches, brags among Men, as if ſhe were the Mother of Compaſſions, the Lady of the Houſe of Prayer, and the Fountain of all Bleſſings: Laſtly, one who ſpreads forth about her a great Mantle, therewith to betoken the largeneſs of her Mercies and Favours; which ſhe ſays, ſhe denies to none that will come to her with faith. And now let St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Auſtin,</hi> or any good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an judge what kind of Creatures theſe Spirits are; and what great difference there is between thoſe which among the Pagans did perpetually labour for Sacrifices, and theſe, which now among the Papiſts, are all for Maſſes, and the greateſt oblations that can be ſet on <hi>Romes</hi> Altars. Mean while we may be confident, that none but God alone can own Sacrifices, Altars, and Churches to be ſerved with; none but Devils ever owned Images to ſpeak, move, or any wiſe to work in; ſuch Spirits as theſe may be the Authors of all the boaſted Miracles, Apparitions, and Revelations among the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>; and ſuch appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and deluſive Operations are
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48378:84"/>
very fit for ſuch Spirits: and both fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, and reſerved for the laſt times? And ſo it may be gueſs'd what that Church is that hath her proper eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment both from ſuch <hi>Wonders,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Saints.</hi>

               <p>Much more doth the learned Doctor urge, to prove that what the Papiſts offer to the Shrine of that which they call the Bleſſed Virgin, can be nothing leſs than giving Divine Honour and Adoration to an unclean Spirit; but I fear I have been tedious in tranſcribing this; tho it were to be wiſhed that all profeſſed Chriſtians were truly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the danger, and damnableneſs of this <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine. For, if</p>
               <p>That which was never commanded by God in his Word, ought not to be introduced into his Worſhip: If,</p>
               <p>Whatſoever pretended Saint or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel claims a Religious Adoration, be to be reputed <hi>Diabolical,</hi> and <hi>unclean</hi>; Then what can be concluded of thoſe <hi>Worſhippers,</hi> and theſe <hi>Saints</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, unleſs it be this, that they have not introduced only the <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:48378:85"/>
but the down-right Worſhipping of Devils.</p>
               <p>It is not for nothing that the Holy Spirit of God doth in the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, by his inſpired Pen-men ſo often warn, and call off his People from I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry; it is not for nothing that the Eternal Fountain of Bleſſedneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes ſuch an inflamed Jealouſy againſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for departing after ſtrange Gods; and that the Divine Vengeance always followed that <hi>Impious Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with ſuch tremendous, and ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgments: For when once the profligated Spirits can obtain for Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their Temples and Altars; it is not to be expected that the true, and Eternal God ſhould have any place in the heart of ſuch a People. Therefore the Scripture calls Idolatry a <hi>departing</hi> from the <hi>Holy One,</hi> a <hi>going a Whoring</hi> from him. The <hi>Samaritans</hi> had that Opinion of the works which <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer performed by Witchcraft, and a Diabolical Confederacy, that they called <hi>him</hi> the mighty power of God, in the 8<hi>th</hi> Chap. of the <hi>Acts.</hi> But by the verſe preceding, it appears that he had faſcinated their minds, and laid his Charms on their underſtandings, that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48378:86"/>
they were in ſuch a condition as <hi>Paul</hi> terms the <hi>Galatians,</hi> they were <hi>bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> that they ſhould not <hi>Obey</hi> the <hi>Truth.</hi> And it cannot be ſuppoſed that any thing ſhort of ſome forcible <hi>Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> could prevail with thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, to give <hi>faith</hi> to thoſe <hi>lying Wonders,</hi> and Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to thoſe <hi>eluding Spirits,</hi> which upon that account, have the Shrines erected amongſt them.</p>
               <p>By what hath been ſaid, it is evident, that thoſe Ghoſts, or Spirits which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Temples, and Worſhip, are no other then ſome of the <hi>Tainted, Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Legions</hi>; and that the ſtrange Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles performed by the Images, or at the Shrines of theſe <hi>Deities,</hi> are the old deluſions continued; whereby they drew the Antient Pagans after their Oracles, Groves, and Pythons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Papiſts now a days into an Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Images, Altars, and Relicks. Still the <hi>old Confederacy</hi> is kept up, tho under new Forms, and Notions. And perhaps it is none of the ſmalleſt Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Agents of that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to impoſe upon their Credulous Ones the belief that there is no ſuch thing as a Witch; that ſo their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48378:86"/>
of that kind may the better paſs under the notion of a Miracle. But by the following diſcourſe, any one that will not wilfully blind himſelf, may diſcern the ſtrange, and vaſt power that the Deceiver of the Nations ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains amongſt the degenerate race of men. And ſo I have put an end to the firſt Part.</p>

               <p>ACcording to your deſire in a Letter I received from you on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, I have here ſent you the true, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48378:88"/>
real Account of the paſſages you deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. That which was related by our late Dean, was thus; That about 45 years ſince, the houſe of <hi>Peter Pain,</hi> then a Shoe-maker in St. <hi>Mary Poel Street</hi> in this City, was extreamly diſturbed with moſt ſurprizing, and unaccountable noiſes for ſome time; and one night above the reſt, about 12 of the Clock, the uſual noiſe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſo great a light through the whole Houſe, as if every Room had been full of burning Tapers, or Torches; Theſe repeated ſcenes of Horrour ſo amuſed the whole Family, that they applied themſelves to Mr. <hi>Toogood,</hi> the then Miniſter of St. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas,</hi> who was eaſily prevailed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to viſit the Houſe; which he had no ſooner entred, but he became an Ear-witneſs of the moſt dreadful, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed noiſes; ſo, together with the whole Family, he repaired into a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at one end of a Gallery, at the other end of which, was a large bulky Trunk, full of old lumber, and ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, that four or five men were not able to lift it: Having ſhut the door to them, the Miniſter went to Prayers, during part of which time, the noiſe continued, and on a ſudden ſomething
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48378:89"/>
was flung againſt the Chamber door, with extraordinary violence, upon which the noiſe immediately ceaſed. When Prayer was ended, they went to go forth of the Chamber door, but could by no means force it open, until they had called for the aſſiſtance of ſome of the Neighbours, who running in to their relief, found the door barr'd cloſe with the great Trunk aforeſaid; upon which they all concluded that it was caſt there in that violent manner, when they heard that mighty ſhock againſt the door, juſt before the ceaſing of the noiſe. This is a true account of that paſſage, which the Gentleman aforeſaid had from the Son of the late Dean above mentioned, who was then an Apprentice in the houſe; and the whole Tranſaction is ſtill recent in the memories of the Neighbours, who were Witneſſes of the amazing Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which at that time diſturbed that houſe. Divers other ſtupendious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances accompanied theſe noiſes, which by reaſon of the great diſtance of time, and place, we can have no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account of.</p>

               <p>FRom Mr. <hi>Merideth</hi> I was informed that <hi>January</hi> laſt was eight years, he had a Son, and three Daughters, (all between the age of fourteen, and eight years) taken with violent Convulſive Fits, within a weeks time of each other, to the great amazement of many Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, and Divines, and multitudes of others that beheld them. The firſt ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms they obſerved of their coming, was the Childrens complaining of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable pains in their heads, and ſides, ſuddenly upon which their Limbs, Mouth, and Eyes would be diſtorted into unimaginable alterations, and their Arms and Legs, though of thoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der years, extended for ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſtrength of the ſtouteſt man to reduce them; during theſe Fits, they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48378:90"/>
would ſometimes laugh, at other times cry for an hour together, then on a ſudden creep about the floor, up againſt the Bed-poſts and the Teſter of the Beds, <hi>like ſo many Cats,</hi> as the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man phraſes it. (<hi>A Lady of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood told me they would hang about the walls, and Cieling of the Room, like Flies, or Spiders.</hi>) Sometimes they would foam at the mouth, then fall down as dead, &amp; in a ſhort time repeat their Actions, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the room in the ſame ſtrange, and ſtupendious poſtures; Towards night their fits always left them, and they ſlept undiſturbed moſt part of the night, but inſtantly upon their awaking, their Fits returned, and tormented them more or leſs, with very little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals all the day. One of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters three days following, in the height of her Fit repeated in a ſolemn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick ſort of manner the ſame form of ſpeech; which was a praedicting her own death to be in ſome few days, and the happy ſtate ſhe was entring into, as alſo ſeveral things which ſhould ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly befal her Father, and Family; but nothing of it ever came to paſs. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them vomited pins; during their whole indiſpoſition, they were daily attended by Miniſters praying
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48378:90"/>
with them, and continued in a courſe of Phyſick prepared by the advice of the Ableſt Doctors in the City. In the <hi>May</hi> following they recovered, and are well ever ſince to this day; and (which is very admirable) when their Fits had wholly left them, they did not appear the leaſt weakened by them.</p>

                  <head>Advertiſement.</head>
                  <p>THo in the Relation now recited, there be no mention made of any ſuſpected <hi>Witch,</hi> by whoſe power the aforeſaid Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were reduced to that deplorable ſtate, and ſome of the Phyſitians that adminiſtred to them, are of opinion that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of faſcination in the caſe, but what was purely the effect of a natural diſtemper. I muſt crave their pardon if I diſſent from them, for theſe following Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though the account Mr. <hi>R.</hi> gives of it do not make mention of any <hi>Witch,</hi> or reſemblance of ſuch a one that appeared to the Children, during the time of their Fits: It is very probable he might have no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that particular, and as likely that the Confederate Agent might purpoſely avoid ſhewing any perſonal figure to them,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48378:91"/>
leſt the Relations, upon ſuch notice, ſhould detect and proſecute the peccant party.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Here are Symptoms vaſtly tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the effects of any natural diſtemper; not to inſiſt on the diſtorting of the Limbs and parts of their Bodies, which are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Concomitants of Convulſions; but that the Extenſion of their Leggs and Arms ſhould ſo vaſtly tranſcend the power of a ſtrong man to reduce them; looks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above what nature alone could pretend to, eſpecially in Children of their Age.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> Who can look upon their crawling and hanging about upon the Bed-poſt and the Walls, without plainly diſcerning the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-foot of faſcination? Could a natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition furniſh them with Tallons, or Claws to faſten themſelves to thoſe places after ſuch a manner? This hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by others that have been under the power of <hi>With-craft,</hi> that the <hi>Witch,</hi> or her familiar have lifted the patient by all four againſt the ceiling, or held them ſo againſt the ſide of a Wall, where they have ſeemed to hang in the air; (an example of which Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi> mentions in his third Relation, containing the Witch-craft of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Stile)</hi> that I think it needleſs to urge this point any further.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> But what can poſſibly be thought of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48378:91"/>
vomiting of pins? If there could be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any natural diſtemper that could breed braſs wyre in the body, it would be hard to Imagin how they ſhould come to be pointed, and headed, without an Artificer; This ſort of torture is ſo familiarly practiſed upon the bodies of perſons, under thoſe ſad Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that if there were no other mark of the black Art; this it ſelf were enough to remove all ſcruple.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> Whatever others may think of their being ſo ſoon reſtored to a ſtate of Convaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, upon the removing of their fits; by all the violences they underwent: This alone were enough to evince the diſtemper to be preternatural: For if thoſe Torturing pains and Convulſions had been the effect of any natural Infirmity; it could not be ſuppoſed but that bodies ſo battered would have required ſome proportionable time, gradually to arriveo a ſtate of Health.</p>

                           <p>ABout Fifteen years ſince having buſineſs that detained me for ſome time at <hi>Leith,</hi> which is near <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I often met ſome of my acquaintance at a certain houſe there, where we uſed to drink a glaſs of Wine for our refecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the woman which kept the houſe, was of honeſt Reputation among the neighbours, which made me give the more attention to what ſhe told me one day about a Fairy-Boy (as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him) who lived about that Town; ſhe had given me ſo ſtrange an account of him, that I deſired her I might ſee him the firſt opportunity, which ſhe promiſed; and not long after paſſing that way ſhe told me, there was the <hi>Fairy-Boy</hi>; but a little before I came by,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48378:92"/>
and caſting her eye into the ſtreet, ſaid, look you Sir, yonder he is at play with thoſe other Boys; and deſigning him to me, I went, and by ſmooth words and a piece of money got him to come into the houſe with me; where in the preſence of divers people, I demanded of him ſeveral Aſtrological Queſtions, which he anſwered with great Subtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and through all his diſcourſe carryed it with a cunning much above his years, which ſeemed not to exceed ten, or eleven.</p>
                           <p>He ſeemed to make a motion like drumming upon the Table with his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, upon which I ask'd him, whether he could beat a drum? To which he replied, yes Sir, as well as any man in <hi>Scotland</hi>; for every <hi>Thurſday</hi> Night, I beat all points to a ſort of people that uſe to meet under yonder Hill (point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the great Hill between <hi>Edenbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> and <hi>Leith</hi>) how Boy quoth I? What company have you there? There are Sir, (ſaid he) a great company both of men and women, and they are entertained with many ſorts of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick beſides my drum; they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides plenty of variety of Meats and Wine, and many times we are carried into <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> in a night, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48378:93"/>
return again; and whilſt we are there we enjoy all the pleaſures the Country doth afford: I demanded of him, how they got under that Hill? To which he replied, that there were a great pair of gates that opened to them, though they were inviſible to others, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there were brave large rooms as well accommodated as moſt in <hi>Scotland.</hi> I then asked him, how I ſhould know what he ſaid to be true? Upon which he told me he would read my fortune, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I <hi>ſhould have two wives, and that he ſaw the forms of them ſitting on my Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> that both would be very handſom women; as he was thus ſpeaking, a woman of the neighbour-hood coming into the room demanded of him what her fortune ſhould be? He told her that ſhe had had two Baſtards before ſhe was married; which put her in ſuch a rage that ſhe deſired not to hear the reſt.</p>
                           <p>The woman of the Houſe told me that all the People in <hi>Scotland</hi> could not keep him from the Rendeſvous on <hi>Thurſday</hi> night; upon which by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing him ſome more money, I got a promiſe of him to meet me at the ſame place, in the afternoon the <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> following, and ſo diſmiſt him, at that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48378:93"/>
time. The Boy came again at the place and time appointed, and I had prevailed with ſome friends to continue with me (if poſſible) to prevent his moving that night; he was placed between us, and anſwered many queſtions, without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go from us, until about eleven of the clock he was got away, unperceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the company, but I ſuddenly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, haſted to the door, and took hold of him, and ſo returned him into the ſame room; we all watched him, and on a ſudden he was again got out of the doors, I follow'd him cloſe, and he made a noiſe in the ſtreet as if he had been ſet upon; but from that time I could never ſee him.</p>

Neither do I find any thing in it, more then hath been reported (by very unqueſtionable Pens) to the ſame purpoſe.

               <p>THat which was publiſhed in <hi>May</hi> 1683. concerning the Daemon, or Daemons of <hi>Spraiton,</hi> was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of a letter from <hi>T.

               <p>About the month of <hi>November</hi> in the year 1682. In the Pariſh of <hi>Spraiton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> one <hi>Francis
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48378:95"/>
Fey</hi> (Servant to Mr. <hi>Philip Furze</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Field near the dwelling houſe of his ſaid Maſter, there appeared unto him, the <hi>reſemblance</hi> of an <hi>Aged Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> like his maſters Father, with a Pole or Staff in his hand, reſembling that he was wont to carry when living, to kill the moles withal: The <hi>ſpectrum</hi> approached near the young man, whom you may Imagin not a little ſurprized at the <hi>appearance</hi> of one that he knew to be dead; but the <hi>ſpectrum bid him not be afraid of him, but tell his Maſter</hi> (who was his Son) that ſeveral <hi>Legacies which by his Teſtament he had bequeathed were unpaid, naming Ten Shillings to one and Ten Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to another, both which perſons he named</hi> to the young man, who replyed, that the party he laſt named was dead, and ſo it could not be paid to him; The Ghoſt anſwered, <hi>He knew that, but it muſt be paid to the next Relation,</hi> whom he alſo named: The ſpectrum likewiſe ordered him to carry Twenty Shillings to a Gentlewoman, Siſter to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, living near <hi>Totneſs</hi> in the ſaid County, and promiſed if theſe things were performed to trouble him no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but at the ſame time the <hi>ſpectrum,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>his ſecond wife,</hi> (who was alſo dead, <hi>called her wicked woman</hi>;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48378:95"/>
though the Gentleman who writ the letter knew her, and eſteemed her a very good woman: And (having thus related him his mind) the ſpectrum left the young man; who according to the <hi>direction</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> took care to ſee the ſmall Legacies ſatisfied, and carryed the Twenty Shillings, that was appointed to be paid the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman near <hi>Totneſs,</hi> but ſhe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refuſed to receive it; being ſent her (as ſhe ſaid) from the Devil: The ſame night the young man Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her houſe, the aforeſaid <hi>ſpectrum</hi> appeared to him again; whereupon the young man challenged his promiſe, <hi>not to trouble him any more,</hi> ſaying, he had performed all according to his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that the Gentlewoman, his Siſter, would not receive the Money: <hi>To which the ſpectrum replied, that was true indeed</hi>; but withal <hi>directed</hi> the young man to ride to <hi>Totneſs, and buy for her a Ring of that value, which the Spirit ſaid ſhe would accept of</hi>; which being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided accordingly, ſhe received: Since the performance of which the Ghoſt, or Apparition of the old Gentleman, hath ſeemed to be at reſt, having never given the young man any further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:48378:96"/>But the next day after having deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ring, the young man was riding home to his Maſters houſe, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Servant of the Gentle womans near <hi>Totneſs,</hi> and near about the time of their entrance (or a little before they came) into the Pariſh of <hi>Spraiton</hi> aforeſaid, there appeared to be upon the horſe behind the young man, the reſemblance of the <hi>ſecond wife</hi> of the old Gentleman, ſpoken of before. This Daemon often threw the young man off his horſe, and caſt him with ſuch violence to the ground, as was great aſtoniſhment, not only to the Gentlewomans Servant (with him) but to divers others, who were ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the frightful action, the ground reſounding with great noiſe, by reaſon of the incredible force, with which he was caſt upon it. At his coming into his Maſters yard, the horſe which he rid, though very poor, &amp; out of caſe, leaped at one ſpring 25 foot, to the amazement of all that ſaw it. Soon after the She-ſpectre ſhewed her ſelf to divers in the houſe (<hi>viz.</hi>) The aforeſaid young man, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs <hi>Thomaſin Gidly, Ann Langdon</hi> born in that Pariſh, and a little Child, which by reaſon of the troubleſomeneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the Spirit, they were fain to remove from
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48378:96"/>
that houſe. She appeared ſometimes in her own ſhape, ſometimes in forms very horrid, now and then like a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Dog belching out fire, at another time it flew out at the window, in the ſhape of a Horſe, carrying with it only one pane of glaſs, &amp; a ſmall piece of Iron.</p>
               <p>One time the young mans head was thruſt into a very ſtrait place, betwixt a Beds head, and a Wall, and forced by the ſtrength of divers men to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thence, and that not without being much hurt, and bruiſed, ſo that much blood appeared about it: upon this, it was adviſed he ſhould be bleeded, to prevent any ill accident that might come of the bruiſe; after bleeding, the ligature, or binder of his Arm was removed from thence, and conveyed about his middle, where it was ſtrained with ſuch violence, that the girding had almoſt ſtopp'd his breath, and kill'd him, and being cut aſunder, it made a <hi>ſtrange and diſmal noiſe,</hi> ſo that the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by were affrighted at it. At di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other times he hath been in danger to be ſtrangled with Cravats, and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs, that he hath worn about his Neck, which have been drawn ſo cloſe, that with the ſudden violence he hath near been choaked, and hardly eſcaped death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:48378:97"/>The Spectre hath ſhewed great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at the Perriwigs which the young man uſed to wear, for they are often torn from his head after a very ſtrange manner, one, that he eſteemed above the reſt, he put in a ſmall box, and that box he placed in another, which he ſet againſt the wall of his Chamber, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a Joint-ſtool, with other weight, a top of it; but in ſhort time the boxes were broken in ſunder, and the Perri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wig rended into many ſmall parts and tatters: Another time, lying in his Maſters Chamber, with his Perriwig on his Head, to ſecure it from danger, within a little time it was torn from him, and reduced into very ſmall frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. At another time one of his Shoe-ſtrings was obſerved (without the aſſiſtance of any hand) to come of its own accord out of his Shoe, and fling itſelf to the other ſide of the Room; the other was crawling after it, but a Maid eſpying that, with her hand drew it out, and it ſtrangely <hi>claſp'd,</hi> and <hi>curl'd</hi> about her hand like a living <hi>Eel,</hi> or <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi>; this is teſtified by a Lady of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Quality, too great for excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who was an Eye-witneſs. The ſame Lady ſhewed Mr. <hi>C.</hi> one of the young mans Gloves, which was torn in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48378:97"/>
his pocket, whilſt ſhe was by; which is ſo dexterouſly tatter'd, and ſo artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially torn, that it is conceived a Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler could not have contrived an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to have laid it abroad ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and all this done in the pocket, in the compaſs of one minute.</p>
               <p>It is farther obſervable, that if the aforeſaid young man, or another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who is a Servant Maid in the houſe, do wear their own Clothes; they are certainly torn in pieces on their backs, but if the Clothes belong to any other, they are not injured after that manner. Many other ſtrange and fantaſtical freaks have been done by the ſaid Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or Spirit, in the view of divers perſons: a Barrel of Salt of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity, hath been obſerved to march from room to room without any human aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>An hand-iron hath ſeemed to lay it ſelf croſs overthwart a pan of Milk that hath been ſcalding over the fire; and two flitches of Bacon have of their own accord deſcended from the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, where they were hung, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced themſelves upon the hand-iron.</p>
               <p>When the Spectre appears in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of her own perſon, ſhe ſeems to be habited in the ſame cloaths,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48378:98"/>
and dreſs, which the Gentlewoman of the houſe (her Daughter-in-Law) hath on at the ſame time. Divers times the feet and legs of the young man aforeſaid have been ſo intangled about his Neck, that he hath been looſed with great difficulty: ſometimes they have been ſo twiſted about the frames of Chairs, and Stools, that they have hardly been ſet at liberty. But one of the moſt conſiderable inſtances of the malice of the Spirit againſt the young man, happened on <hi>Eaſter</hi> Eve, when Mr. <hi>C.</hi> the Relator, was paſſing by the door of the houſe, and it was thus.</p>
               <p>When the young man was returning from his Labour, he was taken up by the <hi>skirt</hi> of his <hi>doublet,</hi> by this <hi>Female Daemon,</hi> and carried a heighth into the Air: He was ſoon miſſed by his Maſter, and ſome other Servants that had been at labour with him; and after diligent enquiry, no news could be heard of him, until at length (near half an hour after) he was heard <hi>ſinging,</hi> and <hi>whiſtling</hi> in a bog, or quagmire, where they found him in a kind of <hi>Trance,</hi> or <hi>extatick fit,</hi> to which he hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been accuſtomed, (but whether before the Affliction he met with from

this <hi>Spirit,</hi> I am not certain) he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected much after ſuch ſort, as at the time of thoſe <hi>Fits</hi>; ſo that the people did not give that <hi>attention,</hi> and <hi>regard</hi> to what he ſaid, as at other times; but when he returned again to himſelf (which was about an hour after) he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly proteſted to them, that the Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon had carried him ſo high, that his Maſters houſe ſeemed to him to be but as a <hi>Hay-cock</hi>; and that <hi>that during all that time, he was in perfect ſenſe, and prayed to Almighty God not to ſuffer the Devil to deſtroy him:</hi> and that he was ſuddenly ſet down in that Quagmire.</p>
               <p>The Workmen found one Shoe on one ſide of his Maſters houſe, and the other on the other ſide, and in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eſpied his Perriwig hanging on the top of a Tree: by which it appears he had been carried a conſiderable heighth, and that what he told them was not a Fiction.</p>
               <p>After this, it was obſerved, that that part of the young mans Body, which had been on the mud in the Quagmire, was ſomewhat benummed, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly deader than the other; whereupon the following <hi>Saturday,</hi> which was the day before <hi>Low-ſunday,</hi> he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Crediton, alias Kirton,</hi> to be blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48378:99"/>
which being done accordingly, and the Company having left him for ſome little ſpace; at their return they found him in one of his Fits, with his <hi>fore-head</hi> much <hi>bruiſed,</hi> and <hi>ſwoln</hi> to a <hi>great bigneſs,</hi> none being able to gueſs how it happened, until his recovery from that <hi>Fit</hi>: When, upon enquiry, he gave them this account of it; <hi>That a Bird had with great ſwiftneſs, and force flown in at the Window, with a ſtone in its beak, which it had daſhed againſt his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, which had occaſioned the ſwelling which they ſaw.</hi> The people much wondering at the ſtrangeneſs of the Accident, diligently ſought the ſtone, and under the place where he ſat, they found not ſuch a ſtone as they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but a weight of Braſs or Copper, which it ſeems the Daemon had made uſe of on that occaſion, to give the poor young man that hurt in his fore-head. The perſons preſent were at the trouble to break it in pieces, every one taking a part, and preſerving it in memory of ſo ſtrange an Accident. After this, the Spirit continued to moleſt the young man in a very ſevere and rugged man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, often handling him with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; and whether it hath yet left its violences to him, or whether the young

               <p>THis Woman had been the Wife of a Vicar belonging to the Quire of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and had been very honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and well educated, and lived in good reputation with her firſt husband, and during the time of her Widow-hood, when ſhe taught a School of Girles in <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> which practice ſhe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Country when the Wife of <hi>J.H.</hi> And lived with him in modeſt and virtuous manner: She was then about 57. Years of Age, and had with her a Son by her former husband aged about 17. Years or upward. There lived in the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage at a houſe over againſt this School-Miſtreſs, a woman that had been of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48378:101"/>
evil fame among the neighbours, and ſuſpected of divers ill practices. The firſt apprehenſion that ſhe had of any danger from the ſuſpected party, was upon this occaſion; the ſuſpected agent came to the houſe of the School-Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and asked her to lend her a piece of ſmall changing money, which ſhe refuſed to do; whereupon the other told her that ſhe knew ſhe had ſuch a piece about her, and it ſhould be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if ſhe had lent it to her, ſo ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the houſe muttering: In the evening the patient ſtanding at the door of her houſe, ſaw a monſtrous great <hi>Toad</hi> walking upon all four like a Cat, and coming from the houſe of the ſuppoſed, directly towards her; upon which ſhe retired into the houſe, and deſired her husband to get ſome Inſtrument, wherewithal to diſpatch that monſtrous vermin; as he was coming towards the door, he met with it in the entry, and before he had the power to ſtrike at it, it ruſht ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into another room, and was never ſeen afterwards. That very night the School-Miſtriſs was taken in a moſt Tormenting Fit (though before ſhe had ſtill been a brisk healthy woman) with violent prickings and pains, as if
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48378:101"/>
her inſide had been ſtuck with pins, needles or thorns, inſomuch that with the great Tortures of her body, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of blood uſed to come from her in her Urine, which was very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable the firſt night. Theſe Fits ſeized on her very frequently, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times twice or thrice in one day, ſometimes whole days together: And it was very obſervable, that juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of her fit, there would come into the Room a vaſt large Cat, after that another, and ſo till the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were ſeven, or nine; theſe would crawl about, and ſtick againſt the walls, making a dreadful yelling, hideous noiſe, and after they had continued about a quarter of an hour, they would ſuddenly diſappear, when they were gone a mighty great light, like a flaſh of lightning, would ſtrike in at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and hang about the walls in heaps of light like fire, and paſs from one room into another, for an hour or more at a time, and ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued all the night long, ſhining through the Windows into the Street, and viſible to the Neighbours; all the while this light continued, ſhe was in the higheſt extremity of Miſery, and would often cry out, naming the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

party, this continued upon her for the ſpace of about 17 years, for it came firſt, when ſhe was about the age of 40 years; and it had reduced a ſtrait well proportioned body to a very crooked deformity. The Phyſicians were all of opinion that the inner parts of her body were wounded by ſome Diabolical Art, and ordered her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move her Habitation, which ſhe did into a Houſe thereby; but it proved to no purpoſe, for the evil Inſtrument followed her there alſo, and of many young Broods of Chickens, which ſhe attempted to nurſe up for many years, ſhe could not raiſe one; but they would ſuddenly turn round, twiſting their Necks ſeveral times about, until they dropt down dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She kept two Cats of her own, for which ſhe had a great fancy; but it is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that as ſoon as the other ſort of Cats entered the room, they would fly as if they were Devil-drove, ſometimes into the Fire, ſometimes the Oven, ſometimes up the Chimny, or any way to avoid the room, whilſt the reſt were there, nor could they ever be brought to enjoy themſelves after, but ſtarved, and pin'd away after a piteous manner.</hi> A little time after her removing to the ſecond houſe, her Son came from <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> about the Age

above ſpecified, he was a ſtrong, and healthful youth for his years; but had not been there above two or three months, before he was taken after a moſt dreadful manner, in raving, and frantick Fits, ſo that five or ſix men could not hold him, he would ſpring out of their hands, and leap up with his head againſt the Cieling, ſometimes he would catch up a Knife, Pen-knife, or Razor, and therewith endeavour to cut his own. Throat, or do himſelf ſome other miſchief, roaring out in moſt frightful manner, <hi>That the ſuſpected was by him, and commanded him to do it, or elſe ſhe would ſtrangle him, or choke him with pins, or ſuch like:</hi> So that they very diligently ſought up, and laid aſide Knives, Scizers, Razors, or whatſoever elſe might prove dangerous to him on ſuch Occaſions: Notwithſtanding which, (and though they had cleared his Pocket of ſuch Weapons, at the coming of his Fit) they ſhould ſee and find in his Hands, and his Pockets, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of thoſe miſchievous Inſtruments they had juſt before laid aſide. After theſe Fits, he would caſt out of his mouth Pins, and Needles, in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and with extream weakneſs be forced to keep his Bed ſeveral days.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:48378:103"/>One day as the young man was in the height of one of his Fits, his Mother ſaw the ſuſpected Party <hi>ſcrambling againſt the wall of the room,</hi> and immediately called out to her Husband, <hi>John, John!

This af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Woman would often repair to the Church, but if the Malevolent were there, ſhe had not the power to enter, but could continue in the Porch, or at the Window. The Son continued in thoſe amazing Fits for about five years; and then ran away in one of them, and hath neither been ſeen, nor heard of ſince. The Mother continued in that languiſhing ſtate for about ſeventeen years, and then died of pain and grief; but died very ſenſible, having the uſe of a good reaſon, and vigorous Faculties to the laſt. She was of Opinion that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, beſide the ſuſpected Party, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to her miſery; as for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Malevolent, ſhe lived about five years after the Afflicted.</p>

               <p>I Had an Account of this Paſſage from my worthy Friend, Dr. <hi>B.</hi> who had made good enquiry into the certainty of it; and though it carry along with it an Air, perhaps, of too much levity for this diſcourſe; yet thoſe who rightly conſider it, will find cauſe to believe there is ſomewhat in it that deſerves a more ſerious, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate reflection.</p>
               <p>There was in this Gentlemans Houſe a Huntſman, and a Falconer, as is uſual with Perſons of ſuch Quality; but it is pretty difficult to determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Elements, which nurſt up their reſpective Game, or the complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and humour of the Perſons, was moſt different: One of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was a Fellow much devoted to a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48378:104"/>
glaſs of Liquour, as is uſual with men of his Function, and therefore when he once laid down his Head upon his Pillow, found himſelf very unfit for any other Contemplations, then what his ſleep preſented him withal. The Falconer, on the contrary, was of a Temper more Conſiderate, and very fond of a Book by night, becauſe he ſeldom found the other, who was his Bedfellow, in a humour to diſcourſe: and therefore would often mind him of the tendency of his drunken Courſes, and to bethink himſelf ſometimes of lying down ſoberly, leſt it might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen he ſhould never awake more in this world. The Morals wrought lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on the ſtupidity of the Huntſman; who anſwered him only with reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aſſuring him that Falconers uſed to look upwards, and blaſpheme, when the Huntſman looked downwards, and therefore minded him to regard his own ſtate. In ſome ſuch ſort of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe they had paſſed the night, till the Huntſman compoſed himſelf to ſleep; the Falconer betook himſelf to a certain Book he had got out of the Chaplains Chamber, who uſed to lend him one at times, to incourage him in reading: It happened to be of the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48378:105"/>
wrong ſort for the poor Falconer; for he had not read much in it, before he ſaw ſomething come to the ſide of the Bed, which he could have wiſht far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off: the frightful Goblin brought to his remembrance what the Huntſman had charged him withal, <hi>viz. looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and Blaſpheming,</hi> ſo that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to get ſome ſpeech of the Huntſman in this extremity, and by much jogging, and importunity, at laſt prevailed with him to underſtand what troubleſome company he had in the Room with him; but all he could get of his drouſy Companion, was only this; <hi>Good Devil do not miſtake, for that is the Falconer</hi>; and ſo turned him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſleep again; which put the poor Falconer into a deeper Conſternation; till at length he had the Courage to call to ſome of the Neighbour Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, amongſt whom, the Chaplain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awake, came to his relief; and it is thought in very good ſeaſon, for the Company he had unadviſedly raiſed, began to be very Troubleſome.

               </head>
               <p>ABout the year 1667. being with ſome Perſons of Honour at the Houſe of a Nobleman in the Weſt Country, which had formerly been a <hi>Nunnery</hi>: I muſt confeſs I had often heard the Servants, and others that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, or lodged there, ſpeak much of the noiſes, ſtirs, and Apparitions that frequently diſturbed the Houſe, but had at that time no apprehenſions of it; for the Houſe being full of Strangers, the Noblemans Steward, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> lay with me in a fine Wainſcot Room, called my Ladies Chamber; we went to our Lodging pretty early, and having a good fire in the Room, we ſpent ſome time in reading, in which he much delighted: then having got into Bed, and put out the Candles, we obſerved the Room to be very
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48378:107"/>
light, by the brightneſs of the Moon, ſo that a Wager was laid between us, that it was poſſible to read written hand by that light upon the Bed where we lay; accordingly I drew out of my Pocket a Manuſcript, which he read diſtinctly in the place where he lay: We had ſcarce made an end of diſcourſing about that affair, <hi>when I ſaw</hi> (my face being towards the door, which was lockt) <hi>entring into the Room, through the door, five Appearances of very fine and lovely Women, they were of excellent ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and their dreſſes ſeemed very fine, but covered all but their faces, with thin, white Vails: whoſe skirts trailed largely on the floor. They entered in a file one after the other, and in that poſture walked round the Room, till the foremoſt came, and ſtood by that ſide of the Bed where I lay,</hi> (with my left hand over the ſide of the Bed; for my head reſted on that arm, and I determined not to alter the poſture I was in) <hi>ſhe ſtruck me upon that hand with a blow that felt very ſoft,</hi> but I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver remember whether it were cold or hot; I demanded <hi>in the name of the Bleſſed Trinity what buſineſs they had there,</hi> but received no anſwer; then I ſpoke to Mr. <hi>C.</hi> Sir, do you ſee what fair Gueſts we have come to viſit us?
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48378:108"/>
Upon which they all diſappeared: I found him in ſome kind of Agony, and was forced to graſp him on the breaſt with my right hand (which was next him underneath the Bed-cloaths) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could obtain ſpeech of him; then he told me that he had ſeen the fair Gueſts I ſpoke of, and had heard me ſpeak to them; but withal ſaid, that he was not able to ſpeak ſooner unto me, being extreamly affrighted at the ſight of a dreadful Monſter, which aſſuming a ſhape betwixt that of a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Bear, attempted to come upon the Beds foot. I told him, I thanked God nothing ſo fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful had preſented itſelf to me; but I hoped (through his aſſiſtance) not to dread the Ambages of Hell. It was a long time before I could compoſe him to ſleep, and though he had had many diſturbances in his own Room, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of others in the Houſe, yet he acknowledged he had never been ſo terrify'd, during many years abode there.</p>
               <p>The next day at Dinner he ſhewed to divers Perſons of Principal Quality, the mark that had been occaſioned on his Breaſt by the gripe I was forced to give him, to get him to ſpeak, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48378:108"/>
all the paſſages very exactly; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, he proteſted never to lie more in that Room; upon which, I ſet up a reſolution to lodge in it again, not knowing but ſomething of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe troubles might by that means be imparted to me.</p>
               <p>The next night therefore I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Bible, and another Book to be laid in the Room, and reſolved to ſpend my time by the fire in reading, and contemplation, till I found my ſelf inclin'd to ſleep; and accordingly having taken leave of the Family at the uſual hour, I addreſs'd my ſelf to what I had propoſed, not going into Bed till paſt one in the morning: a little after I was got into Bed, I heard ſomething walk about the Room, like a Woman with a Tabby Gown trailing about the Room; it made a mighty ruſhelling noiſe, but I could ſee nothing, though it was near as light as the night before; it paſſed by the foot of the Bed, and a little opened the Curtains, and thence went to a Cloſet door on that ſide, through which it found admittance, although it was cloſe lockt; there it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to groan, and draw a great Chair with its foot, in which it ſeemed to ſit and turn over the leaves of a large
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48378:109"/>

               <head type="sub">A Relation of the Apparition of Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, their ſeeming to keep a Fair, and what happened to a certain man that endeavoured to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in amongſt them.</head>
               <p>REading once the Eighteenth of Mr. <hi>Glanvils</hi> Relations, <hi>p.</hi> 203. concerning an Iriſhman that had like to have been carried away by Spirits, and of the Banquet they had ſpread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in the Fields, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it called to mind a paſſage I had often heard of Fairies, or Spirits, ſo called by the Country People, which ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in great Companies at divers times; at ſometimes they would ſeem to dance, at other times to keep a great Fair or Market: I made it my buſineſs to inquire amongſt the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours what Credit might be given to that which was reported of them; and by many of the Neighbouring In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants I had this Account confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:48378:110"/>The place near which they moſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſhewed themſelves, was on the ſide of a Hill, named <hi>Black-down,</hi> between the Pariſhes of <hi>Pittminſter,</hi> and <hi>Cheſtonford,</hi> not many miles from <hi>Tanton</hi>: Thoſe that have had occaſion to Travel that way, have frequently ſeen them there, appearing like Men and Women of a ſtature, generally, near the ſmaller ſize of Men; their habits uſed to be of red, blew, or green, according to the old way of Country Garb, with high crown'd hats. One time about 50 years ſince, a perſon (living at <hi>Comb</hi> St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> a Pariſh lying on one ſide of that hill, near <hi>Chard</hi>) was riding towards his home that way; and ſaw juſt before him, on the ſide of the hill a great company of People, that ſeemed to him like Country Folks, Aſſembled, as at a Fair; there was all ſorts of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities to his appearance, as at our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Fairs; Pewterers, Shoe-makers, Pedlars, with all kind of Trinkets, Fruit, and drinking Booths; he could not remember any thing which he had uſually ſeen at Fairs, but what he ſaw there: It was once in his thought that it might be ſome Fair for <hi>Cheſtonford,</hi> there being a conſiderable one at ſome
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48378:110"/>
time of the year; but then again he conſidered that was not the ſeaſon for it; he was under very great ſuprize, and admired what the meaning of what he ſaw ſhould be; at length it came into his mind what he had heard concerning the Fairies on the ſide of that hill: and it being near the Road he was to take, he reſolved to ride in amongſt them, and ſee what they were; accordingly he put on his Horſe that way; and though he ſaw them perfectly all along as he came, yet when he was upon the place where all this had appeared to him, he could diſcern nothing at all, only ſeemed to be crouded, and thruſt, as when one paſſes through a throng of people: all the reſt became inviſible to him, until he came at a little diſtance, and then it appeared to him again as at firſt. He found himſelf in pain, and ſo haſted home; where being arrived, a <hi>Lameneſs</hi> ſeized him all on one ſide, which continued on him as long as he lived, which was many years; for he was living in <hi>Comb,</hi> and gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to any that inquired of this Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident for more than twenty years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward: and this Relation I had from a Perſon of known Honour, who had it from the Man himſelf.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AT South <hi>Petherton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> lives a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (very well known to all the Neighbouring Gentry, not only for her Ancient Deſcent, but for her extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Piety, and Charity more Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious,) whom I cannot mention without an Honourable Reſpect, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving often had the happineſs to have been entertained with moſt obliging reſpect, both by the virtuous Mother, and her <hi>Congenerous</hi> Iſſue.</p>
               <p>It was on <hi>Midſummer</hi> day, in the year 1680. I happened to pay a viſit to that worthy Family; and finding the Lady and her Daughters at home, after paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing common Civilities, the eldeſt of the Daughters, (who is a very Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Accompliſht Lady) informed me that there had been the ſtrangeſt
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48378:112"/>
thing done in their Family the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night, that ever was heard on, for their Servant Maids had raiſed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo went on to give a thorow relation of what you will hear by and by: only I think it beſt to let the Maids themſelves tell the Story, which after the old Lady had called them into the Room, they did after this manner. One of them, I take it, the talleſt, ſpeaking in the name of both.</p>
               <p>We had been told divers times, that if we faſted on <hi>Midſummer</hi> Eve, and then at 12 a Clock at night laid a cloath on the Table; with Bread, and Cheeſe, and a cup of the beſt Beer, ſetting our ſelves down, as if we were going to eat, &amp; leaving the door of the Room open; we ſhould ſee the Perſons whom we ſhould afterwards Marry, come into the Room, and drink to us: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we kept a true Faſt all the day yeſterday, unknown to any of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and at night having diſpoſed of my Miſtreſſes to Bed, we faſtened the ſtair door of their Rooms, which came down into the Hall, and locked all the doors of the Yard, and whatever way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides led into the Houſe, except the door of the Kitchen, which was left open to the Yard for the <hi>Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearts</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:48378:112"/>
to enter; it being then near twelve a Clock, we laid a clean cloath on the Kitchen Table, ſetting thereon a Loaf and Cheeſe, and a Stone Jug of beer, with a drinking glaſs, ſeating our ſelves together in the inſide of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with our faces towards the door: We had been in this poſture but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, before we heard a mighty ratling at the great Gate of the Yard, as if it would have ſhook the Houſe down, there was a jingling of Chains, and ſomething ſeemed to prance about the Yard like a Horſe, which put us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great terrour, and affrightment, ſo that we wiſht we had never gone ſo far in it; but now we knew not how to go back, and therefore kept the place where we were: my Maſters Spaniel (for the young Captain was then alive) got againſt the door of the ſtair foot, and there made ſo great a noiſe with houling, and ratling the door, that we feared they might have taken notice of the diſturbance; but preſently came a young man into the Kitchen, (<hi>here one of the young Ladies interrupted her, ſaying, Houſewife, it was the Devil</hi>) to which the Maid replied, <hi>Madam I do not believe that, but perhaps it might be the Spirit of a Man,)</hi> and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48378:113"/>
making a bow to me, he took up the Glaſs, which was full of Beer, on the Table, and drank to me, filling the Glaſs again, and ſetting it on the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as before, then making another bow, went out of the Room. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after which, another came in the ſame manner, and did the ſame to the other Maid (whom ſhe named, but I have forgot) and then all was quiet, and after we had eaten ſome Bread and Cheeſe, we went to Bed. So the Maid ended what ſhe had to ſay, and left the Room; but I muſt not forget that all this while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other Maid ſtood by her, and acknowledged all ſhe had ſaid to be true.</p>
               <p>Then I deſired to know of the old Lady, how they came to underſtand this of the Maids, for I thought they did not care to have it divulged; upon which ſhe replied, we ſaw in their faces the next morning ſomething of an alteration, as if they had been frighted, and my eldeſt Daughter go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a Room, where we uſe to ſet aſide cold Meat, ſaw part of an Apple-Pye, which was appointed for their Dinners the day before, to be there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht, and marking ſome other little Circumſtances, began to be Inquiſitive,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48378:113"/>
until ſhe had ſifted out the buſineſs. The Ladies were very much troubled at what the Maids had done, and threatned to put them away upon it: but upon the interceſſion of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and their being penitent for what they had done, it was paſſed by. It was not long after, before the talleſt of the Maids was Married to him, which ſhe ſaid had appeared unto her, and as I remember, he was a Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in Sir <hi>Edward Philips</hi>'s Regiment: but I fear that Weddings ſought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by ſuch unwarrantable means, can hardly expect a Bleſſing; I wiſh it may prove otherwiſe for both their ſakes. The young Ladies after that, would (to mind the Maids of their indiſcretion) call them <hi>the Spirits of Men.</hi>

While he lay in this miſerable Torment, it happened that a Woman (then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be dumb) entred his Houſe; and pointing to the Chamber where he was lying, made ſigns to thoſe that were at that time in his Houſe, to follow her out of doors; they at firſt took no notice of her, but ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting therein, they went out with her, to ſee if they could underſtand her meaning. She led them into a Houſe adjacent (a Tenant of this diſtreſſed Gentleman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s,) and having entred the Houſe, ſhe gave ſigns to them to open a Cheſt there; whereupon they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Woman of the Houſe to open the Cheſt, that they might ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their Curioſity in ſo far humouring her. The Woman conſcious of her own Guilt, refuſed; whereupon they beginning to ſuſpect there was more then ordinary in it, that made her ſo averſe from it, broke it open, which when they had done, they found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an Image of Wax, which they took out, and found a great many Pins ſtuck in the ſame ſide of it, as the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48378:120"/>
Gentlemans Pain held him in his. They took out the Pins, and afterwards returning to the Houſe, they asked the Gentleman how he found himſelf; who anſwered that he was altogether eaſed of his pain, and in a very good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then they took the Pins, and ſtuck in the other ſide of the Image, when immediately the Gentleman cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of a pain that had ſeized him on his other ſide, as vehement as the former was. They took them out again, and he was eaſed as formerly. The Witch was had before a Juſtice, but I never heard that ſhe was further troubled, whether for that that was not ſufficient proof in Law to take away her life, or for ſome other reaſon I know not. The pretended dumb Woman was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſeized, and impriſoned at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> where ſhe pretended to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the uſe of her Tongue, and ſpoke, whereas before ſhe ſeemed to be dumb. Several ſtrange things were reported of her there; which being variouſly reported, I would not trouble the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with a Relation thereof; mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nothing herein but what I know to be of undoubted truth, and what was acknowledged by all. After ſhe had been kept there for two or three
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48378:121"/>
weeks, ſhe was tranſported to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and put in the <hi>Cannon-gate</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where ſhe remained above half a year. She was ſeveral times had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council, and examined. A great many Perſons out of Curioſity viſited her, ſome of whom had better kept away; for if they were guilty of Love Intrigues, ſhe uſed ſufficiently to expoſe them, ſparing neither Quality nor Sex. When any queſtioned how ſhe came by that Knowledge, and charged her with having correſpondence with the Devil, ſhe made anſwer in the words of our Saviour; <hi>If Satan caſt out Satan, how can his Kingdom ſtand</hi>? Denying that ſhe had any Compact with the Devil, but affirming that it was a gift ſhe had from her Birth. She was ſet at liberty, after having been a conſiderable time in Priſon. But the Gentleman after her ſeizure, was taken with the ſame diſtemper, and died thereof.</p>

               <head type="sub">An Account of a Perſon that by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of a Girdle from one Witch to another, was reduced to Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</head>
               <p>NEar the River of <hi>Tweed</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a Woman ſuſpected to be a Witch, had a Child very ſick, and ſeeing ſhe could not help it by lawful means, ſhe had her addreſs to her Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Art; this way ſhe could not free her Child, unleſs ſhe laid either the ſame Diſeaſe, or a worſe upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſon, otherwiſe ſhe muſt have thwarted the intereſt of her Infernal Maſter, which was not in her Power, if it had been her inclination, as undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly it was not, to effect: She, hearing that a Scrivener was going two or three miles to a place where ſhe had an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who ſerved the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with her ſelf, to wit, the Prince of Darkneſs, went to him, and deſired him to carry a Girdle to her. Her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48378:122"/>
in ſending it by him was, that her Child might be cured of its Diſtemper, and the ſame or a worſe laid on this innocent Perſon. Whether ſhe had any Malice againſt him, I could not be informed; but I rather incline to think that it was only in Obedience to her Maſters Command. He took the Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle from her, and when he came to the place, went, and delivered it to the Party. The Woman at the delivery of it, having never had any prejudice againſt the Bearer, was really troubled that he ſhould have been imployed therein, knowing how much it would tend to his hurt, and asked him if her Friend could find no other Perſon to impoſe this trouble upon, but him, to carry it, not daring to tell him the danger he had thereby involved himſelf in, leſt ſhe ſhould bring her ſelf into a greater, by being diſcovered, only pretending that her Friend was very uncivil in troubling a Perſon of his Quality with any ſuch thing. He anſwered her, that there was no indiſcretion in it, adding withal, that it was his utmoſt deſire to be ſerviceable to any Perſon, without reſpect to their Quality, to the utmoſt of his Power. The Woman entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with ſeveral Diſcourſes, and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48378:122"/>
ſeemed very Courteous to him; and at parting ſhe deſired him to have a ſpecial care that he did not ſleep till he got home, telling him that he would be ſtrongly inclined to ſleep, and withal certifying him that if he ſlept any where by the way, he would have cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent it while he lived. He promiſed to take care to prevent it, beginning then to be ſomewhat afraid, recalling to mind that the Perſon he had the Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle from, was under the Bruit of a Witch. As he was going homewards, he found himſelf mightily aſſailed by ſleep, and he ſtrove as much againſt it as was poſſible; but when he was come within leſs then a quarter of a Mile of his own Houſe, it ſo prevailed upon him, that he could go no further, but laid himſelf down upon the Graſs to ſleep. When he awaked again, he was raging Mad, and continued ſo for a long time after without reſpite, and during his life he was Mad in the three hot Months in Summer, and at the Full of the Moon. His Son alſo, who was born a conſiderable time after this, was Heir to the ſame Diſtemper, and for ought I know is ſtill alive, and hath the ſame Fits at the uſual times; as alſo a Daughter of the Sons.</p>

               <head>The fifteenth Relation. </head>
               <head type="sub">A ſtrange Apparition, which was ſeen by a Man, as he was going home two Miles in a Winter night, near <hi>Kinneel</hi> by the River of <hi>Forth</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A Certain Man whom I know, a little before <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> ſeveral years ago, went in the morning from his dwelling Houſe, to a Sea-Port Town about two Miles diſtant: And having ſeveral urgent buſineſſes there, he took up the whole day in diſpatching them, and was neceſſitated to ſtay ſtill near eight of the Clock at night At which time he ſet forth, being no wiſe in drink; nor was he at all of a Timorous Nature. He had no Company with him, and walkt on in his Journey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing any thing frightful, or ſo much as thinking on any ſuch. When he was come to the top of a Hill, which was half way home, he of a ſudden ſaw the Appearance of four Men car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a Dead Corps on their Shoulders,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48378:124"/>
unattended by any; which made him eaſily conjecture what it was; beſides, that it is not uſual in that place to bury any in the night time, except it be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the greateſt Quality. This Apparition ye muſt needs think, did ſtartle him a little, there being no Houſes near him; it being a wild place. He thought to ſhun it by going out of the High-way into ſome by-road; which when he did, he found himſelf nothing advantaged thereby; for in the very time that he was turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about, it was tranſported from the High-way, and walkt directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, keeping the ſame diſtance as before; which when he obſerved, he returned into the High-road again. This he attempted to do ſeveral times; but was ſerved after the ſame manner as formerly; whereupon he reſolved to keep ſtraight on in his way, without turning either to the right hand or the left, praying to God to preſerve him from the Devil, or any of his Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The Spectre kept a little before him, obſerving always the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; ſo that if he walkt ſlow, it likewiſe ſlackned its pace, and if he haſtened his ſteps, it likewiſe moved quicker. He followed it on this wiſe,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48378:124"/>
till at laſt it came to a little Stone-Bridge that was over a Brook, about a quarter of a Mile from his Houſe; the Brook was narrow, but not ſo narrow, as that a Man could jump over it; the water in the Winter time would ſtrike a Man above the middle. The four Ghoſts that carried this dead Corps, when they were come to this place, laid the Coffin acroſs the Bridge; ſo that the Man could not go over upon the Bridge, unleſs he ſtept over the Coffin. The Man when he came up was at a ſtand, not knowing what to do in this caſe; to wade through the Brook he had no great mind, in regard the ſeaſon was then cold. To go over the Bridge, and ſo ſtep over it, he durſt not, not knowing, if he ſhould have hazarded ſo to do, what power it might have over him to do him miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. While he was thus muſing, he bethought himſelf of one Expedient, which if he could effect, he thought he might ſafely go over the Bridge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving any hurt: It was this; he deſigned to try if he could prize it off the Bridge into the water with his Cane, for he durſt not adventure to touch it with his hands: But when he went about it, and prized it with all
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48378:125"/>
his ſtrength, he found it remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable as a Rock; yet he continued ſo doing a conſiderable time, till at laſt he broke his Cane. Afterwards, ſeeing no poſſibility of getting over the Bridge, he was neceſſitated to go through the water, notwithſtanding the coldneſs of the Seaſon. When he was got on the other ſide, he ſaw the four Ghoſts take up the Coffin again on their Shoulders, and carry it off the High-way, he viewed them till they carried it over a little Eminence (a piece of ground higher then the reſt, reſembling a Hill, but not ſo high) but after that ſaw it no more. Afterward he went home to his Houſe, and as ſoon as he ſaw the light of the Candle that was burning in the Houſe, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fell down upon the ground. (Which they ſay is uſual to Perſons that are frightened with Apparitions.) His Wife and Servants ſeeing what befel him, inſtantly took him up, brought him to life again, and asked him what might be the Cauſe thereof; he told them that he knew of no Cauſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he found himſelf very well in his Health all the day before, unleſs it were an Apparition he ſaw by the way as he came home, rehearſing the ſtory as is above related.</p>
