            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The humble Petition of Thouſands wel-affected perſons inhabiting the City of London, Westminſter, the Borough of Southwark, Hamlets, and places adjacent.</head>
            <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat although we are as earneſtly deſirous of a ſafe and well-grounded Peace, and that a finall end were put to all the troubles and miſeries of the Common-wealth, as any ſort of men whatſoever: Yet conſidering upon what grounds we ingaged on your Part in the late and preſent Wars, and how far (by our ſo doing) we apprehend our ſelves concerned, Give us leave (before you conclude us by the Treaty in hand) to acquaint you firſt with the ground and reaſon which induced us to aid you againſt the King and his Adherents. Secondly, What our Apprehenſions are of this Treaty. Thirdly, what we expected from you, and do ſtill moſt earneſtly deſire.</p>
            <p>Be pleaſed therefore to underſtand, that we had not ingaged on your part, but that we judged this honorable Houſe to be the ſupreme Authority of England, as choſen by, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the People; and intruſted with abſolute power for redreſſe of Grievances, and proviſion for Safety: and that the King was but at the moſt the chief publike Officer of this Kingdom, and accomptable to this Houſe (the Repreſentative of the People, from whom all juſt Authority is, or ought to be derived) for diſcharge of his Office: And if we had not bin confident hereof, we had not bin deſperately mad to have taken up Armes, or to have bin aiding and aſſiſting in maintaining a <hi>War against Him;</hi> the Laws of the Land making it expreſly a crime no leſſe than Treaſon for any to raiſe War againſt the King.</p>
            <p>But when we conſidered the manifold oppreſſions brought upon the Nation, by the King, his Lords and Biſhops; and that this Honourable Houſe declared their deep ſenſe thereof; and that (for continuance of that power which had ſo oppreſt us) it was evident the King intended to raiſe Forces, and to make War; and that if he did ſet up his Standard, it tended to the diſſolution of the Government: upon this, knowing the ſafety of the People to be above Law, and that to judge thereof appertained to the ſupreme Authority, and not to the ſupreme Magiſtrate, and being ſatisfied in our Conſciences, that the publike ſafety and freedom was in imminent danger, we concluded we had not onely a juſt cauſe to maintain; but the ſupreme Authority of the Nation, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, defend and indempnifie us in time to come, in what we ſhould perform by direction thereof; though the higheſt.</p>
            <p>And as this our underſtanding was begotten in us by principles of right reaſon, ſo were we confirmed therein by your own proceedings, as by your condemning thoſe Judges who in the caſe of Ship-money had declared the King to be Judge of Safety; and by your denying him to have a Negative voice in the making of Lawes; where you wholly exclude the King from having any ſhare in the ſupreme Authority: Then by your caſting the Biſhops out of the Houſe of Lords, who by tradition alſo, had bin accounted an eſſentiall part of the ſupreme Authority; and by your decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Lords, That if they would not joyn with you in ſetling the <hi>Militia,</hi> (which they long refuſed) you would ſettle it without them, which you could not juſtly have done, had they had any reall ſhare in the ſupreme <hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things we took for reall Demonſtrations, that you undoubtedly knew your ſelves to be the ſupreme Authority; ever weighing down in us all other your indulgent <hi>Expreſſions concerning the King or Lords;</hi> it being indeed impoſſible for us to believe, that it can conſiſt either with the ſafety or freedom of the Nation, to be governed either by three or two Supremes, eſpecially where experience hath proved them ſo apt to differ in their Judgments concerning freedom or ſafety, that the one hath bin known to puniſh what the other hath judged worthy of reward; when not only the freedom of the people is directly oppoſite to the Prerogatives of the King and Lords, but the open enemies of the one have bin declared friends by the other, as the Scots were by the Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p>And when as moſt of the oppreſſions of the Common-wealth have in all times bin brought upon the people by the King and Lords, who nevertheleſs would be ſo equal in the ſupreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as that there could be no redreſs of Grievances, no proviſion for ſafety, but at their pleaſure. For our parts, we profeſs our ſelves to be ſo far from judging this to be conſiſtent with freedom or ſafety, that we know no greater cauſe wherefore we aſſiſted you in the late Wars, but in hope to be delivered by you from ſo intolerable, ſo deſtructive a bondage, ſo ſoon as you ſhould (through Gods bleſſing upon the Armies raiſed by you) be inabled.</p>
            <p>But to our exceeding griefe, we have obſerved that no ſooner God vouchſafeth you victory, and bleſſeth you with ſucceſs, and thereby inableth you to put us and the whole Nation into an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute condition of Freedom and Safety: but according as ye have been accuſtomed, paſſing by the ruine of the Nation, and all the blood that hath been ſpilt by the King and his Party, ye betake your ſelves to a Treaty with him, thereby putting him that is but one ſingle perſon, and a publike Officer of the Common-wealth, in competition with the whole Body of the People, whom ye repreſent; not conſidering that it is impoſſible for you to erect any Authority equall to your ſelves; and declared to all the world that you will not alter the ancient Government, from that of King, Lords, and Commons: not once mentioning (in caſe of difference) which of them is ſupreme, but leaving that point (which was the chiefeſt cauſe of all our publike diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, diſturbances, wars, and miſeries,) as uncertain as ever.</p>
            <p>In ſo much as we who upon theſe grounds have laid out our ſelves every way to the uttermoſt of our abilities: and all others throughout the Land, Souldiers and others who have done the like in defence of your ſupreme Authority, and in oppoſition to the King, cannot but deem our ſelves in the moſt dangerous condition of all others, left without all plea of indempnity for what we have done; as already many have found by loſſe of their lives and liberties, either for things done or ſaid againſt the King; the law of the land frequently taking place, and precedency againſt and before your Authoritie, which we eſteemed ſupreme, and againſt which no law ought to be pleaded. Nor can we poſſibly conceive how any that have any waies aſſiſted you can be exempt from the guilt of murderers and robbers, by the preſent laws in force, if you perſiſt to diſclaim the ſupreme authoritie, though their own conſciences do acquit them, as having oppoſed none but manifeſt Tyrants, Oppreſſors, and their adherents.</p>
            <p>And whereas a Perſonall Treaty, or any Treaty with the King, hath been long time held forth as the onely means of a ſafe and wel-grounded Peace; it is well known to have been cryed up principally by ſuch as have been alwaies diſ-affected unto you; and though you have not contradicted it, yet it is believed that you much feare the iſſue thereof; as you have cauſe ſufficient, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you ſee greater alteration in the King and his party then is generally obſerved, there having never yet been any Treaty with him, but was accompanied with ſome underhand-dealing; and whilſt the preſent force upon him (though ſeeming liberty) will in time to come be certainly pleaded, againſt all that ſhall or can be agreed upon: Nay, what can you confide in if you conſider how he hath been provoked; and what former Kings upon leſſe provocations have done, after Oaths, Laws, Charters, Bonds, Excommunications, and all tyes of Reconciliations, to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all thoſe that had provoked and oppoſed them: yea, when your ſelves ſo ſoon as he had ſigned thoſe Bills, in the beginning of this Parliament ſaw cauſe to tell him, <hi>That even in or about the time of paſſing thoſe Bills, ſome deſigne or other was on foot, which if it had taken effect, would not only have rendred thoſe Bills fruitleſſe, but have reduced you to a worſe condition of confuſion, than that wherein the Parliament found you.</hi> And if you conſider, what new Wars, Riſings, Rovolting invaſions, and plottings have been ſince this laſt cry for a Perſonall Treaty, you will not blame us if we wonder at your haſty proceedings thereunto: eſpecially conſidering the wonderfull Victories which God hath bleſſed the Armies withall.</p>
            <p>We profeſſe we cannot chuſe but ſtand amazed to conſider the inevitable danger we ſhall be in, though all things in the Propoſitions were agreed unto; the reſolutions of the King and his party have been ſo perpetually violently and implacably proſecuted and manifeſted againſt us; and that with ſuch ſcorn and indignation, that it muſt be more than ſuch ordinary Bonds that muſt hold them. And it is no leſſe a wonder to us that you can place your own ſecurity therein, or that you can ever imagin to ſee a free Parliament any more in England.</p>
            <p>The truth is (and we ſee we muſt either now ſpeake it, or for ever be ſilent,) We have long expected things of an other nature from you, and ſuch as we are confident would have given ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all ſerious people of all Parties.</p>
            <p>As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That you would have made the ſupreme authoritie of the people, in this Honourable Houſe, from all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Negative Voices, either in the King or Lords.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That you would have made laws for election of repreſentatives yearly and of courſe without writ or ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That you would have ſet expreſſe times for their meeting Continuance and Diſſolution: as not to exceed 40. or 50. daies at the moſt, and to have fixed an expreſſe time for the ending of this preſent Parliament.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That you would have exempted matters of Religion and Gods worſhip, from the compulſive or reſtirictive power of any Authority upon earth, and reſerved to the ſupreme authoritie an un-compulſive power only of appointing a way for the publick, whereby abundance of miſery, perſecution, and heart-burning would for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be avoided.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That you would have diſclaimed in your ſelves and all future Repreſentatives, a power of Preſſing and forcing any ſort of men to ſerve in warrs, there being nothing more oppoſite to freedom, nor more unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in an authoritie impowered for raiſing monies in all occaſions, for which, and a juſt cauſe, aſſiſtants need not be doubted: the other way ſerving rather to maintain injuſtice and corrupt parties.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That you would have made both Kings, Queens, Princes, Dukes, Earls, Lords, and all Perſons, alike liable to every Law of the Land, made or to be made; that ſo all perſons even the Higheſt might fear and ſtand in aw, and neither violate the publick peace, nor private right of perſon or eſtate, (as hath been frequent) without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lyable to accompt as other men.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That you would have freed all Commoners from the Juriſdiction of the Lords in all caſes: and to have taken care that all tryalls ſhould be only by twelve ſworn men, and no conviction but upon two or more ſufficient known witneſſes.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That you would have freed all men from being examined againſt themſelves, and from being queſtioned or puniſhed for doing of that againſt which no Law hath bin provided.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That you would have abbreviated the proceedings in Law, mitigated and made certain the charge thereof in all particulars.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That you would have freed all Trade and Merchandiſing from all Monopolizing and Engroſſing, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That you would have aboliſhed Exciſe, and all kind of taxes, except ſubſidies, the old and onely juſt way of England.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That you would have laid open all late Incloſures of Fens, and other Commons, or have encloſed them onely or chiefly to the benefit of the poor.</p>
            <p n="13">13. That you would have conſidered the many thouſands that are ruined by perpetuall impriſonment for debt and provided for their anlargement.</p>
            <p n="14">14. That you would have ordered ſome effectuall courſe to keep people from begging and beggery, in ſo fruitfull a Nation as through Gods bleſſing this is.</p>
            <p n="15">15. That you would have proportioned puniſhments more equal to offences; that ſo mens Lives and Eſtates might not be forfeited upon trivial and ſlight occaſions.</p>
            <p n="16">16. That you would have removed the tedious burthen of Tythes, ſatisfying all Impropriators, and providing a more equal way of maintenance for the publike Miniſters.</p>
            <p n="17">17. That you would have raiſed a ſtock of Money out of thoſe many confiſcated Eſtates you have had, for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe who contributed voluntarily above their abilities, before you had provided for thoſe that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed out of their ſuperfluities.</p>
            <p n="18">18. that you would have bound your ſelves and all future Parliaments from aboliſhing propriety, levelling mens Eſtates, or making all things common.</p>
            <p n="19">19. That you wovld have declared what the duty or buſineſſe of the Kingly office is, and what not; and aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Revenue, paſt increaſe or diminution, that ſo there might never be more quarrels about the ſame.</p>
            <p n="20">20. That you would have rectified the election of publike Officers of the Citie of London, and of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Company therein, reſtoring the Comunalty thereof to their juſt Rights, moſt unjuſtly with-held from them, to the producing and maintaining of corrupt intereſt, oppoſite to common Freedom, and exceedingly prejudicial to the Trade and Manufactures of this Nation.</p>
            <p n="21">21. That you would have made full and ample reparations to all perſons that had bin oppreſſed by ſentences in High Commiſſion, Star-Chamber, and Counſel Board, or by any kind of Monopolizers or Projectors; and that out of the Eſtates of thoſe that were Authors, Actors, or Promoters of ſo intollerable miſchiefs: and that without much attendance or ſeeking.</p>
            <p n="22">22. That you would have aboliſhed all Committees, and have convayed all buſineſſes into the true method of the uſuall Tryalls of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p n="23">23. That you would not have followed the example of former tyrannous and ſuperſtitious Parliaments, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Orders, Ordinances, or Laws, or in appointing puniſhments concerning opinions or things ſuper-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſtiling ſome blaſphemies, others hereſies, when as you know your ſelves eaſily miſtaken, and that divine Truths need no humane helps to ſupport them: ſuch proceedings having bin generally invented to devide the people amongſt themſelves, and to affright men from that liberty of diſcourſe by which Corruption and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny would be ſoon diſcovered.</p>

            <p n="25">25. That you would have done Juſtice upon the Capital Authors and Promoters of the former or late wars, many of them being under your power: Conſidering that mercy to the wicked, is cruelty to the innocent: and that all your lenity doth but make them the more inſolent and preſumptuous.</p>
            <p n="26">26. That you would have provided conſtant pay for the Army, now under the command of the Lord General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and given rules to all Judges, and all other publike Officers throughout the Land, for their indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and for the ſaving harmleſſe all that have any waies aſſiſted you, or that have ſaid or done any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, Queen, or any of his party ſince the beginning of this Parliament, without which anie of his party are in a better condition then thoſe that have ſerved you; nothing being more frequent with them, then their reviling of you and your friends.</p>

            <p n="27">27. That you would have laid to heart all the abundance of innocent blood that hath bin ſpilt, and the infinite ſpoil and havock that hath bin made of peaceable harmleſs people, by expreſs commiſſions from the King; and ſeriouſly to have conſidered whether the juſtice of God be likely to be ſatisfied, or his yet continuing wrath appeaſed, by an Act of Oblivion.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the like we have long time hoped you would have minded, and have made ſuch an eſtabliſhment for the generall peace and contentfull ſatisfaction of all ſorts of people, as ſhould have bin to the happines of all future generations, and which we moſt earneſtly deſire you would ſet your ſelves ſpeedily to effect; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the almoſt dying honour of this moſt honourable Houſe, would be again revived, and the hearts of your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners and all other well-affected people, be afreſh renewed unto you, the Freedom of the Nation (now in perpetuall hazard) would be firmly eſtabliſhed, for which you would once more be ſo ſtrengthned with the love of the people, that you ſhould not need to caſt your eyes any other waies (under God) for your ſecurity: but if all this availeth nothing, God be our Guide, for man ſheweth us not a way for our preſervation.</p>
