         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
reasons I
ought in duty to
lay all my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
at your <hi>Graces</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:41569:3"/>
feet, and beg your accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of them; yet I was
the more encourag'd to
make this address, because
the subiect seemes natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to have recourse to
your <hi>Graces</hi> Protection.
For the same <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>
that has made your
<hi>Grace Father</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
has made you also <hi>Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
of <hi>Humane Nature.</hi>
Which (as your <hi>Grace</hi>
well knows) has been so
vilely aspersed and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
by our <hi>Adversarie's</hi>
malicious suggestions, that
<pb facs="tcp:41569:3"/>
he is willing indeed to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
such a word as <hi>man</hi> still
to remain amongst us, but
what was alwayes meant,
and design'd thereby, he
has endeavoured to chase
quite out of the world.
The vindication therefore
of <hi>Humane Nature</hi> could
not but seek for protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from that <hi>great example</hi>
of <hi>humanity;</hi> whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
practice doth alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
confute all the
<hi>slanderers</hi> of <hi>mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> had been
pleased to have given on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:41569:4"/>
a History or Roll of
the unjust or unfaithfull;
there would not then have
been such occasion to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
your <hi>Graces</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
such attempts as
this. But when he teaches
that cheating is not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>reason,</hi> but that
it is the first principle and
dictate thereof; for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
credit of being on <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's</hi>
side, people shall count
themselves engaged to be
<hi>Knaves.</hi> And therefore I
have persumed to offer to
your <hi>Graces</hi> Patronage this
<pb facs="tcp:41569:4"/>
small discourse: wherein I
have endeavoured to shew
that those that are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and unrighteous are
not such by <hi>Reason,</hi> or
any advice of <hi>Humane
Nature,</hi> but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have a mind
to be so. And I am not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
discourag'd from
thinking, that by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s
<hi>State of Nature,</hi> and my
<hi>Introduction</hi> thereunto it
may appear to your <hi>Grace,</hi>
that it would not have been
an impossible thing to have
<pb facs="tcp:41569:5"/>
said somewhat to the rest
of his <hi>writings,</hi> wherein he
differs from what is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
believed. But for me
to go about to inform your
<hi>Grace</hi> of the folly or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of Mr <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s
principles; would be next
unto his undertaking to
<hi>read lectures</hi> to all <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your <hi>Grace</hi> cannot but
understand, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
insisted on in this <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi>
have been often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of great <hi>Persons,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:41569:5"/>
by those of <hi>eminent worth</hi>
and <hi>Learning:</hi> and if there
be any reason demanded
why this comes so late
from me; I have nothing
to offer in excuse, either
to your <hi>Grace,</hi> or those
that writ before me. But
yet however from some
experience of your <hi>Graces</hi>
favours towards me, what
I have performed, I hope
may not be altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected:
notwithstanding
the manner of it, being
to appearance not so grave
and solid, does a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten
<pb facs="tcp:41569:6"/>
me. But, since
Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> by affected
garbs of speech, by a
starch'd Mathematical me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
by counterfeit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of novelty and
singularity, by magisteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
haughtinesse, confidence
and the like had cheated
some people into a vast
opinion of himself, and
into a beliefe of things ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dangerous and false; I
did presume, with your
<hi>Graces</hi> pardon, to think
his <hi>writings</hi> so fond and
extravagant, as not to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb facs="tcp:41569:6"/>
being opposed in good
earnest: and thereupon I
was very loth to give them
too much respect, and add
undue weight to them by a
solemn and serious confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
And I hope my
<hi>Dialogue</hi> will not find the
less acceptance with your
<hi>Grace</hi> for those <hi>Letters</hi>
which follow after: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
some are loth to
believe the first <hi>Letters</hi> to
be innocent and useful (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little troublesome
and uneasie to their own
humour) yet your <hi>Grace,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:41569:7"/>
I hope, is satisfied that the
<hi>Author</hi> of them, did hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
therein study the credit
and advantage of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and that our <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi>
would certainly be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reputed and more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable,
were it possible
they all could be, as learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and as bountiful as your
<hi>Grace.</hi> What I have now
perform'd, I humbly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to your <hi>Graces</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable

PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe design of this
<hi>Preface</hi> is not
to advise, or
encourage thee
to read what follows; for I
should not take it well my
<pb facs="tcp:41569:9"/>
self to be so drawn in: but
if thou chancest to look into
it, and be not already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi>'s
<hi>state</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> this is to let
thee know, that thereby is
to be understood a certain sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
time, in which it was
<hi>just</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> for every
man to <hi>hang, draw,</hi> and <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
whom he pleased, when
he pleased, and after what
manner he pleased; and <hi>to
get, possess, use and enjoy</hi>
whatever he had a mind to:
And the reason of this so large
a Charter, was because it was
<pb facs="tcp:41569:9"/>
supposed that these people had
not as yet any ways abridged
themselves of their utmost
liberty, by any voluntary
bargains, or agreements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves; neither
could they be restrained by
any Humane Laws, because
the <hi>Magistrate</hi> was not as yet
chosen.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Dialogue</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(because <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi>
shall not say that I am stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy)
thou wilt find, <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
that with him I have
allowed (though there's ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
small reason for't) such
<pb facs="tcp:41569:10"/>
a time or <hi>state,</hi> wherein
people came into the <hi>World</hi>
(after his own humour)
without being obliged either
to <hi>God, Parents, Friends,
Midwifes,</hi> or <hi>Publick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,</hi>
and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
I have endeavoured
to make out (how far or how
well that's no matter) that
those that are feigned to be
in this condition, have all
such a natural right to their
own <hi>lives,</hi> and what is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<hi>convenient,</hi> that it is
perfectly <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>
for any one of them
<pb facs="tcp:41569:10"/>
to take his utmost advantage,
and to do whatever he thinks
he is <hi>able,</hi> or <hi>pleases</hi> him
best.</p>
            <p>Thou mightest possibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
after I had given each
of the four <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of
the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Pines</hi> a right to
the <hi>fourth part</hi> (which thou
dost not deserve to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
unless thou readest the
<hi>Book)</hi> that I should have
proceeded, and set out eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man's share: and so have
answered to Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s
sixth Article, <hi>Cap. 1. de
Cive.</hi> Wherein he saies,
<pb facs="tcp:41569:11"/>
that a great and necessary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of quarrelling and war
is, that several men oftimes
have a desire to the same
thing; which thing if it
happens not to be capable of
being divided, or enjoyed in
Common, they must needs
draw and fight for't: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of which, he should
have said; if these men
chance to be mad, or void
of reason, it is possible they
may fight for't: For being
that every one of them have
an equal right to this same,
that is in controversie, they
<pb facs="tcp:41569:11"/>
may either <hi>compound</hi> for it
as to its value, or decide
it by <hi>Lot,</hi> or some <hi>other
way</hi> that reason may direct
(which is a Law of <hi>reason</hi>
and <hi>humane Nature,</hi> and
not meerly positive, because
it is in <hi>Law Books.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither did I proceed to
shew what kind of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
they fix'd upon; or how
long they continned in that
<hi>even condition;</hi> or how
every one of them <hi>thrived.</hi>
For perhaps before the year
ran round, <hi>Roger</hi> might
fuddle, or game away all his
<pb facs="tcp:41569:12"/>
               <hi>Estate;</hi> or his <hi>Cattle</hi> might
all dy, and he forc'd to sell
<hi>Land</hi> to get more <hi>Stock.</hi>
Neither have I told you

<hi>Complement</hi> to <hi>Towser,</hi>
nor what was <hi>Towser's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party;</hi>
nor whether they
bow'd only half way, or
down to the ground; nor
which leg the one and t'other
drew back. Which, had I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
an absolute discourse,
should not have been omitted.
All that I shall venture to
say is this, that I hope it
may appear to three or four,
<pb facs="tcp:41569:12"/>
(for I durst not presume to
convert many) that Mr.
<hi>Hobbs</hi> is not such a great
<hi>discoverer</hi> and <hi>afforder</hi> of
<hi>new things</hi> as his own <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces</hi>
and his <hi>Titles</hi> to
<hi>Books</hi> would make thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:
Neither is he so
great a <hi>dispeller</hi> of <hi>clouds,</hi>
but that thou mayst buy an
ell of them under a Mark.
Neither is <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
(or <hi>reason)</hi> so very vile
and raskally, as he writes
<hi>his own</hi> to be, nor his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it altogether so <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative,</hi>
as <hi>Euclid.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:41569:13"/>There's nothing now want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Reader,</hi> but only to
give thee a hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
reasons why I writ this;
and tell thee of most wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things that happen'd, or
else it had been much better.
Thou mayst read on, if thou

thou mayst let it alone; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

                     <p>WELL met <hi>Philautus,</hi>
how does your best

What, stout and hearty?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>I take care of my self, <hi>Sir,</hi>
my <hi>body</hi> is pretty well, I thank
you.</p>

                     <p>Then all is well, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>

                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes truly in my opinion, all
is well, when that is so.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>In your opinion? Why:
doe not all count that well which
you count well: or are you a man
by your self?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>I am just what you see me
to be. But some people I find, have
two <hi>men</hi> to take care of; an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man,</hi> and an <hi>inward man:</hi> for
my part. I am able to maintain but
one; and if I can shift it, that shall
take no hurt, for want of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after. But I begg your pardon,
<hi>Sir,</hi> for I know you not.</p>

                     <p>No matter for that: come,
shall we take a turn or two in the
<hi>Walks?</hi>

                     <p>No, I thank you, unless I
knew your tricks better: you may
chance to get behind me, and bite
me by the Legs. Let them take a
turn with you that have not search'd
into the <hi>fundamental Laws</hi> of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature,</hi> and the <hi>first rise</hi>
of <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Societies.</hi> I know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things than to trust my self
with one that I never saw before.
I have but one <hi>body,</hi> and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41569:14"/>
to carry it home all to my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>You had better I profess,
have no body at all; or compound
to be kick'd and beaten twice a day;
than to be thus dismally tortur'd,
and solicitous about an <hi>old rotten
carcase.</hi>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>Come, come: <hi>you talk like
a young man.</hi> Let me tell you the
<hi>body</hi> is a very precious thing: and
when you can make me believe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
who have <hi>poised King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi>
counted up all the <hi>advantages
of bodily strength,</hi> and am throughly
acquainted with all the <hi>humours</hi> and
<hi>passions</hi> of <hi>mankind,</hi> then will I stay
with you, and venture a kicking.
And so farewell.</p>

                     <p>I know no <hi>honour</hi> any man
has but an <hi>acknowledgement of his
power and greatness:</hi> So that all the
security that I have that you will

not injure me is, that you can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
do it, if you have a mind
to't. And therefore, I pray, doe
so much as take your <hi>honour</hi> along
with you into that other walk, or

I proceed, and say in the first

into your <hi>Book</hi> all that you could

                     <p>What need then was there
of that, in your Third Chapter <hi>de
Cive; the Sacred Scripture is the
Speech of God commanding over all
things by greatest right?</hi> It sounds, I
must confess, somewhat statelily: So
does that in your <hi>Leviathan,</hi> p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.)
<hi>the general use of speech is to transfer
our mental discourse into verbal; or the
train of our thought into a train of
words:</hi> And also that; <hi>Religion conteins
the Laws of the Kingdom of God:</hi> It had
been nothing to have said that <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
teaches how <hi>God</hi> will be serv'd; but
<hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> is a new Notion,
if the word <hi>Law</hi> does but lie near at
hand: So to have said that <hi>somnia
sunt phantasmata dormientium,</hi> or that
<hi>Tempus</hi> was <hi>Phantasma corporis, &amp;c.</hi>
had been old: but go thus; <hi>Phantasma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
dormientium appello somnia,</hi> and
<hi>Phantasma corporis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>appello tempus:</hi>
and then by vertue of the word <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pello,</hi>
and the stately placing of it, it
becomes all your own.</p>

                     <p>But before I go, <hi>Sir,</hi> I must
desire those that are not satisfied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the truth of what I just now
mentioned, to look a little into your
<hi>Logick;</hi> and if they do not there
find a whole <hi>Book</hi> full of nothing but
<hi>new words;</hi> I'le promise you to be
very towardly for the future, and as
modest as the meekest of your <hi>disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:41569:23"/>
and therefore, in the first place,
<hi>I do,</hi> in your name, <hi>decree, that in all
following Ages</hi> Logick <hi>shall not be
called</hi> Logick, <hi>but</hi> Computation; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that</hi> ratiocinor <hi>signifies not only
to</hi> reason, <hi>but to</hi> count <hi>or</hi> reckon;
<hi>and</hi> rationes <hi>the same with</hi> computa:
<hi>and therefore let the art of</hi> reasoning
<hi>be called the art of</hi> computation <hi>or</hi>
counting: <hi>of which there be two
parts;</hi> addition <hi>and</hi> substraction;
<hi>to</hi> add <hi>being all one as to</hi> affirm, <hi>and
to</hi> substract <hi>all one as to</hi> deny <hi>from
whence also I do establish a</hi> Syllogisme
<hi>to be nothing else but the collection of
a</hi> Summ, <hi>or</hi> aggregate: <hi>the</hi> major
<hi>and</hi> minor Propositions <hi>being the</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
<hi>and the</hi> Conclusion <hi>the</hi> summ
<hi>or</hi> aggregate <hi>of those</hi> particulars.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>And what fault can you find
with all this? is it not all new? did
ever any of the <hi>Philosophers</hi> say so
before?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>No truly; nor was there
ever any need that they should
say so: for let people call the two
first <hi>Propositions</hi> either plainly <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,</hi>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41569:23"/>
or <hi>Ingredients</hi> or <hi>Elements,</hi>
or <hi>Premises,</hi> or <hi>Principles,</hi> or <hi>Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
or <hi>Prologues,</hi> or <hi>go befores,</hi> or
<hi>particulars,</hi> or any thing else, so that
I do but understand their meaning,
and <hi>Timothy</hi> is as well contented as
any man alive.</p>

                     <p>'Tis a most excellent <hi>compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
as ever was written: There's a
<hi>definition</hi> of <hi>causa</hi> (which in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Page</hi> we are learnt to call <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)</hi>
that is alone worth a pound
at least; viz. <hi>Causaest summa sive ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatum
accidentium omnium tam in
agentibus, quam in patiente, ad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum
effectum concurrentium, quibus
omnibus existentibus effectum non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istere,
vel quolibet eorum uno absente
existere, intelligi non potest.</hi> A <hi>Cause</hi>
is a certain pack or aggregate of
<hi>trangams,</hi> which being all packed
up and chorded close together, they
may then truly be said in <hi>Law</hi> to
constitute a compleat and essential
pack: but if any one <hi>trangam</hi> be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41569:24"/>
taken out or missing, the pack then
presently loses its packishness, and
cannot any longer be said to be a

and perfect <hi>Idaea</hi> of a <hi>cause</hi> very

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>So very full, <hi>Sir,</hi> that if you
had gon on but a little further, it
would have served for a <hi>Catalogue</hi>
of the <hi>great Turk's Dominions:</hi> but
I hope you will not take it ill, if I
forget it: because I promised my

—<hi>cujus vi res est.</hi> You
have also, <hi>Sir,</hi> another very magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
one of a <hi>Proposition;</hi> which I
care not much if I bestow upon the
<hi>Emperour:</hi> viz. <hi>Propositio est oratio

quâ significat is qui loquitur, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipere
se, nomen posterius ejusdem rei

which agrees very well with what
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41569:24"/>
                        <hi>Zacutus</hi> saies in his Treatise of a
<hi>Spoon,</hi> which he thus defines. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentum

the like are only for huge <hi>Potentates:</hi>
but if any <hi>private Gentleman</hi> has a
mind to be informed in the just, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate
and perfect conception of an

take them thus: <hi>Interrogationes sunt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationes

as, <hi>what's a clock? Precationes

                     <p>Surely thou art broken loose
out of <hi>Hell,</hi> to quarrel thus upon no

                     <p>Those that have nothing

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41569:25"/>
the place of two or three <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
I would not have them trouble
the world with <hi>Logick,</hi> or any thing
else. For as my <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> wisely
observes, nothing has more hindred
the growth of Learning than peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
studying of <hi>new words,</hi> and

                     <p>Then it seems I must learn

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>You may doe as you will for
that; but you know <hi>Doctor Wallis</hi>
thought you had sufficient need of

                     <p>Come, <hi>Tim,</hi> I prethee tell me
one thing, and tell me true: hast
not thou been lately amongst some
of my <hi>Scholars,</hi> and lamentably
baffled and run down by them? and
does not this make thee fret and
fume, and dislike all that I have
written? I am confident, so it is:
for otherwise thou couldst not but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41569:25"/>
be of their opinion, who discern
and declare, that they never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
such <hi>connexion</hi> of things, and
such <hi>close argning,</hi> as I have in all
things given the <hi>world</hi> an instance
of.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>You have now said that which
I wish'd and watch'd for: Because it
gives me opportunity of mentioning
<hi>another device</hi> you make use of to
deceive people, and get applause;
<hi>viz.</hi> you get together a company of
words, such as <hi>power, fear,</hi> and the
like (as was said before) and
thrust these into every <hi>page</hi> upon one
pretence or other; and then you
call this connexion, and boast (as
you doe in your <hi>Preface de Cive)</hi>
that <hi>there is but one thing in all your
Book, which you have not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>I hope you will not betray your
judgment so much, as to find fault
with my <hi>language,</hi> which all the world
admire: Are there any words more
truly <hi>English</hi> and natural than <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
fear,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Questionless they are very
good words, when rightly made
use of: but to hale them in where
there is no need at all, meerly to
carry on the great work of <hi>power</hi>
and <hi>fear,</hi> and by a forc'd repetition
thereof, to make thence a <hi>seeming
connexion</hi> (with reverence be it
spoken) is very idle and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.
It seemes to me to savour
very much of their humours, who
fall wofully in love with some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>numbers.</hi> One he is sorely
smitten with the complexion and
features of the <hi>number</hi> four. And
so he calls presently for his four <hi>Inns
of Courts,</hi> his four <hi>Terms,</hi> his four
<hi>seasons of the year,</hi> and abundance
of <hi>fours</hi> besides. Nay, the <hi>senses</hi>
are also his; for <hi>smelling</hi> is only a
<hi>gentiler</hi> way of <hi>feeding.</hi> Another
tears his haire, and is raving mad
for the <hi>number</hi> three: and then the
<hi>Inner Temple</hi> and <hi>Middle</hi> are the same,
for they are both <hi>Temples; Easter
Term</hi> and <hi>Trinity Term</hi> differ but a
few days; <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Autumn</hi> are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41569:26"/>
all one, and rather than he'l ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
above three <hi>senses,</hi> he'l
split his <hi>mouth</hi> up to his <hi>ears.</hi>

                     <p>what dost think, <hi>Tim,</hi> that
I have nothing else to doe, but to
hear thee tattle over a company of
foppish <hi>Similitudes?</hi> if thou hast a
mind to talk, child, speak sence, if
thou canst; and learn of me to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
closely.</p>

                     <p>You are a most speciall pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
for <hi>reasoning</hi> indeed: one may
plainly see that, by what you say
in the tenth Chapter of your <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan,</hi>
and in the eighth of your
<hi>Humane nature;</hi> where you fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a great rapture of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of <hi>power;</hi> making every thing
in the whole world that is good,
worthy and honourable, to be <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi>
and nothing is to be valued
or respected but upon the accompt
of <hi>power.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>And is not <hi>power</hi> a very
good thing?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>A most excellent thing! I
know nothing like it but the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41569:27"/>
stone:</hi> for it does all things, and
is all things, either at present, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
or afterward. Thus <hi>Beauty</hi> is
<hi>honourable,</hi> as a precedent sign of <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
generative:</hi> and actions proceeding
from strength are <hi>honourable,</hi> as signs
consequent of <hi>power motive.</hi> Now if
<hi>faculty</hi> had come in there instead of
<hi>power,</hi> it would not have done so
well. Again, <hi>riches</hi> are <hi>honourable</hi> as
signs of the <hi>power</hi> that acquired them;
&amp; gifts, cost, &amp; magnificence of houses
are <hi>honourable,</hi> &amp;c. as signes of <hi>riches.</hi>
A <hi>Mathematician</hi> is <hi>honourable</hi> because
if he brings his knowledg into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
he is able to raise <hi>powerful for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications,</hi>
and to make <hi>powerful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines</hi>
and instruments of war. A pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
man is <hi>honourable,</hi> because he
is <hi>powerfull</hi> in advice: and a <hi>person</hi> of
good <hi>natural wit, and judgment</hi> is <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,</hi>
because it signifies <hi>strong
parts</hi> and <hi>powers.</hi> In short, <hi>Sir,</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
there is nothing either in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or speeches, in Arts or Sciences,
in wit or judgment, in man, woman
or child that is good &amp; valuable, but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41569:27"/>
it is all upon the accompt of <hi>power.</hi>

                     <p>I defy thee, if thou goest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to make any thing that I have
said ridiculous.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>No: I need not: because
you have already done it to my
hand; for with such tricks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
as these, I'le undertake to
make a <hi>flageolet</hi> the most dreadfull
and powerful thing upon the face
of the whole earth. For it either
shall be <hi>powerful</hi> in it self, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
me to the favour of those
that have <hi>power,</hi> or be a defence
against <hi>power,</hi> or it shall hire and
purchase <hi>power,</hi> or be in the road
to <hi>power,</hi> or be in the road
to <hi>power,</hi> or a signe of <hi>powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> or a

thou railest at a venture; and dost

let's pitch upon some <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental

                     <p>Which side? that's a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
very fit indeed for a <hi>Timothy</hi> to
ask. I hold that side that all

men in the whole world doe
hold.</p>

                     <p>I am asham'd to tell thee: It
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41569:28"/>
is such a very silly question. I doe
hold then, that all men naturally are

                     <p>I beseech you, <hi>Sir, hold</hi> no
more: there's enough for any one
man to hold. I remember, <hi>Philau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
you told me ā while ago that all
men by nature were <hi>doggish, spightfull</hi>

<hi>according to philosophical principles

there's not a word of any more

besides some small mater that was

the rest, <hi>Philautus,</hi> it is as common,

                     <p>For no reason at all but
only because it is true. Thus we
know that old <hi>Arstotle,</hi> and his dull
soakers understood no further of
the great mysteries of the <hi>senses,</hi>
and their several <hi>objects;</hi> but only
bluntly to say, that <hi>sense was a kind
of knowledge occas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thing,</hi> &amp;c. and that <hi>an object
is a thing that causes that knowledge:</hi>
and that <hi>colour is the object of the eye,</hi>
and that <hi>sound is the object of the
ear.</hi> But when <hi>Philautus</hi> comes to
<hi>Town,</hi> he brings us news to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
informing us, that <hi>all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
proceeds from the action of the
thing it self, whereof it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
and when the action is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
the conception it produceth is
called sense:</hi> (there <hi>called</hi> stands
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41569:31"/>
in the right place) <hi>and the thing
by whose action the same is produced,
is Called the object of the sense.
(That's</hi> well placed again:) <hi>And
that by sight we have a conception of
colour, which is all the notice and
knowledge the object imparteth to us
of its nature by the eye.</hi> This ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishes!
<hi>and by hearing we have a
conception called sound, which is all
the knowledge we have of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the object from the ear.</hi> Now
who would not immediately spurr
forth as far as <hi>Dover</hi> to meet a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi>

in my own House: nay though
it should be burnt down to the
very ground; yet for a need I
can make shift once or twice a year
to <hi>phansie</hi> it still standing, or at

upon this is founded that old friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<hi>surfeit</hi> with a long story of <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,</hi>
in a <hi>Scheme</hi> of yours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Sciences</hi> (Lev. p. 40.)
that my stomach has scarce stood

                        <hi>I have seen it</hi> Sir, <hi>several
times, but all the art is in the catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and I count my self never a
whit the nearer, for being told, as
I am there by you; that</hi> Science is
the knowledge of all kind of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences:
which is also called Philosophy.
And Consequences from the accidents of
bodys natural is called natural philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.
And Consequences from accidents
of politick bodies, is called Politicks or
civil philosophy. And Consequences
from the stars, Astronomy: Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41569:34"/>
from the Earth, Geography: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
from vision, Opticks: Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
from sounds, Musick. <hi>And so</hi>
Consequences <hi>from the rest are to be</hi>
called <hi>the rest. I profess</hi> Philautus,
<hi>These same</hi> Consequences <hi>did so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
stick in my head, that for a long

body that I met,</hi> Consequence.</p>

                     <p>I am very nigh of your mind,

all the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> before you, be

because it did not come into their

supposing the people of <hi>England</hi> had

<hi>Vision was not made by</hi> species intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onales,
that <hi>the image of any thing by

do not exist</hi> in return naturâ; I say, I

this, but possibly we might have had

<hi>to the</hi> Duke <hi>of</hi> Newcastle, <hi>you tell
him, that</hi> all that have written before
you of Iustice and Policy, have inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
each other and themselves with
contradiction, that they have altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
built in the aire, and that for
want of such infallible and inexpugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Principles as you have Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
laid down, in your Hamane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
Government and Peace have
been nothing else to this day but mutual
fears: <hi>And when one comes to look
for these same</hi> infallibles, <hi>and</hi> inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnables,
<hi>there's nothing but about</hi>
conception, <hi>and</hi> phantasmes, <hi>and a
long</hi> race <hi>amongst the</hi> passions; <hi>where</hi>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:41569:36"/>
to endeavour is appetite, to turn back
is repentance, to be in breath is hope,
to be weary despair, and to forsake the
course is to dye, <hi>and the like; so that
the only way to make a</hi> Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Governour, <hi>is for himself to be a
good</hi> Iockey, <hi>and for his Subjects
rightly to understand the several</hi>

<hi>of your</hi> Hamane Nature, <hi>in his</hi>
Epistle <hi>to the</hi> Reader. Our Author
<hi>(saies he)</hi> hath written a body of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
upon such Principles, and in
such order as is used by men conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in demonstration: which being
distinguished into three Parts, <hi>de Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,
de Homine, de Cive,</hi> each of
the Consequents begin at the end of the

                     <p>And whoever he was, he
spoke like a <hi>man</hi> of <hi>understanding;</hi>
it was my design that they should,
and by great industry I brought it
to pass.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>And I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> how many
pounds of candle did it cost you, to
tie <hi>de Corpore,</hi> and <hi>de Homine</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Methinks you need not be
long about that; for <hi>Body</hi> is either
taken in <hi>general</hi> or in <hi>particular;</hi> in
<hi>general,</hi> that is <hi>de Corpore:</hi> and <hi>man</hi>
being a <hi>particular sort of body, de Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
must needs follow close at the
heels; and so they are taken care of:
but indeed to fasten <hi>de Homine,</hi> and
<hi>de Cive</hi> cleverly together requires a
little more knocking and hamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
and therefore to do that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
we must scratch and rub our
heads very well, and warily call to
mind, that <hi>a man is to be considered
in two respects; either as he is a body
natural, consisting of flesh, blood, and
bones; or as he is a member of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41569:37"/>
Body Politick:</hi> that is, as he is leg,
arm, finger or toe of the <hi>Common-wealth;</hi>
and therefore let us have
one <hi>Book de Homine,</hi> as he is a <hi>natural
Body,</hi> and another <hi>de Cive,</hi> as he is a
<hi>limb</hi> of the <hi>huge Giant,</hi> the <hi>Common-wealth;</hi>
and so there's an <hi>Euclidean
trap</hi> laid, that <hi>de Cive</hi> shall follow
<hi>de Homine;</hi> and so it does, but not
bluntly: for though one would have
thought that this had jointed them
so close together, that <hi>Archimedes</hi>
himself could never have pulled
them asunder; yet to put all out of
danger, it is best to rivet them a little
faster, by putting in a most <hi>obliging
transition;</hi> in the last Chapter, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
<hi>de Homine fictitio;</hi> where we are
learnt further to consider, that <hi>a man
is either by, or for himself a man, called
a real man; or he is a man for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
called a fictitious man.</hi> Such a
one is he that <hi>acts another,</hi> is <hi>deputed</hi>
for <hi>another, engages</hi> for <hi>another,</hi> or
the like. Now because in all well
governed <hi>Common-wealths</hi> (now any
one by that word may perceive, that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41569:37"/>
                        <hi>de Cive</hi> is just at <hi>Towns</hi> end) for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>trading, bargaining, commerce, &amp;c.</hi>
there's great use of <hi>Deputies, Proxies,
Factors, Sponsors, Embassadors</hi> and
the like; therefore let the chief of
this Chapter be spent in the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of such <hi>fictious men</hi> in a
<hi>Common-wealth;</hi> and then turn over
the leaf, and behold, there stands to
the honour of <hi>Euclid,</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of all <hi>Philautians,</hi> the <hi>Book
de Cive.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>No; but I had ten times ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do so, than as the</hi> natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
<hi>who being employed to
write the</hi> History <hi>of a</hi> Crow, Iack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daw,
<hi>and</hi> Pye, <hi>after many Months
spent in dressing, ranking, stringing,
and hanging them together, at last
entered upon the business after this
elegant and digested manner.</hi> Being
about to treat of the natural rights
and powers of Crows, Iack-daws, and
Pyes; subjects often handled by weak
and heedless observers: we shall be
forced so to write, as if none had been
before us in this kind: all which must
be performed with such prudence and
consideration, as justly become so very
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41569:38"/>
great an affair; seeing that hereupon
depend not only the knowledge of the
chiefest and best of Birds; but also of
all beasts in general: Nay, even of
man himself, and the great <hi>Trojane</hi>
horse the Common-wealth. And that
we may be sure to lay a solid foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and neither to repent, nor recal, it
will be necessary in the beginning exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to state the true conception or <hi>Idaea</hi>
of a Bird, for as much as the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
conceptions of Crow, Iack-daw,
and Pye are comprehended under that
common one of Bird: And therefore
that we may avoid-all equivocation,
which is the original of Errors, and
that there may be no quarrelling or
disputing in following Ages, we do
ram down for the future Peace and
Government of all Nations, that the
phantasme or conception of a Bird is a
flying phantasme or conception. Having
thus warily and fundamentally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
what is a Bird in general; we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
now to the three Birds themselves:
and that we may do nothing without
method, the blackest and largest of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41569:39"/>
them we call a Crow; and seeing that
likeness of colour begets likeness of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
we go on to the next, whose
conception is full out as black as a Crow,
but not altogether so large, and this
we call a Iack-daw; and because that
black strictly taken only for black, is a
more simple conception than black and
white together, therefore we thought fit
to speak of a Pye in the last place, which
partakes of the two former concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as to black, but differs from both
as to white.</p>

                     <p>Not after the manner as you
have done; because we have an art
by it self for that purpose. You
might as well have put in fifty Pages
about <hi>Musick,</hi> as about <hi>Opticks:</hi>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:41569:40"/>
for man you know has as many <hi>ears,</hi>
as <hi>eyes.</hi> But here's the business, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus,</hi>
you take very great pains in
all things to be singular. Where you
should use <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> there you
will scarce let us have any at all; and
when there's not the least need, then
you pour them forth as if you were
bottomless: And thus many a <hi>Reader</hi>
comes, suppose, to one of your <hi>Books</hi>
that has an ordinary <hi>title;</hi> and there
finding a company of strange <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Schemes;</hi> and not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
them, he presently cries
out, <hi>What a brave man is this</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus?
<hi>What wonders and rarities
does he afford upon such a common sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject?
Surely he has gone the deepest
that ever searched into Nature.</hi> I tell
you, <hi>Philautus,</hi> he that has a mind to
take advantage of this humour of
yours, and to run things together by
force that have no relation, he
may easily thrust the fifteen <hi>Books</hi> of
<hi>Euclid</hi> into the <hi>London Dispensatory,</hi>
or <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s <hi>Institutes</hi> into a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

                     <p>You know <hi>Tim,</hi> that I have
laid a foundation for this in my <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature,</hi> and 'tis an easy matter
now to finish the business.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes truly I have (as I
told you before) looked over that
same foundation of yours, called
<hi>Humane Nature,</hi> and I think it much
more fit for the <hi>bottom</hi> of <hi>minc'd pyes,</hi>
than of any <hi>Policy</hi> or government.
Be pleased to goe on, <hi>Sir,</hi> and shew
some <hi>other reasons</hi> why the ancient
<hi>Philosophers</hi> did not think, as you
doe, that all men are naturally beasts.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41569:41"/>
You told me, as I remember, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
else, wherein they miscarried;
besides that they went in a <hi>wrong
method,</hi> and did not first design a
Treatise of <hi>Humane Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>I did so: and it was thus:
<hi>viz.</hi> they all blindly running one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, and taking severall
things for granted that were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
false; they laid down that for
a <hi>fundamental truth,</hi> which is no
otherwise than a <hi>fundamental lie.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>That was a great oversight
indeed; a <hi>fundamental truth,</hi> and
a <hi>fundamental lie!</hi> I profess, <hi>Sir,</hi>
they dwell a great way asunder.
But I pray what was that fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
lie.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>That man was a sociable

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Lack a day! how easie a
matter is it for <hi>old folks</hi> to dote and
slaver, and for <hi>young ones</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and lick up the spittle?
I'd have laid three cakes to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that my <hi>old Masters</hi> had been
in the right. But are you very,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41569:41"/>
very certain that they are not? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you may have taken yours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
trust, as well as they did theirs:
and if so then courage cakes, for
I don't intend to be a <hi>Centaure.</hi>
                     </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>That's a good one indeed:
as if they who had all their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
from the tap-droppings of
their <hi>predccessors,</hi> and the moral
tradition of the <hi>Barber's</hi> Chair,
were not much more subject to take
thing upon trust, than one, who
supecting all kind of opinions, have
turn'd over the whole <hi>History</hi> of
the <hi>world,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> her self.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>And there belike you found,
that <hi>man is not a sociable creature.</hi>
I wish there were some way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
this business: for you know,
<hi>Sir,</hi> the world is full of trade, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintace,
neighbours and relations:
and for the most part <hi>man</hi> has had
the crack and fame, for five or six
thousand years, of being tolerably
tame; and methinks it is a great
pity now at last to be sent to the
<hi>Tower</hi> amongst the <hi>Lyons,</hi> or to be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41569:42"/>
driven to <hi>Smithfield,</hi> with a mastiffe
and a great cudgell. I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi>
what doe you mean by those words,

                     <p>You know, <hi>Philautus,</hi> that
men are apt to sort, to herd; they
love to enquire, to confer, and
discourse: and when people get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
corners, and covet to be alone;
we usually count such to be sick,
distemper'd, melancholy or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
mad. And I suppose the
question is not concerning such,
but concerning <hi>healthful</hi> and <hi>sober
men.</hi>

                     <p>There you are quite out,
<hi>Tim:</hi> for when I say that men <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi>
doe not <hi>seek society,</hi> or <hi>are not
born fit for society;</hi> I don't mean
<hi>full grown men,</hi> such as are able to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41569:43"/>
carry or eat a quarter of beef, but I
mean <hi>children:</hi> which is plain in the
very <hi>phrase</hi> it self, <hi>Tim,</hi> if thou
wouldst mind any thing: it being
there said, <hi>not born fit;</hi> so that to
say, a man is not <hi>born fit</hi> for soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
is all one as to say, that a man
<hi>newly born</hi> is not <hi>fit for society,</hi> or does

                     <p>Well let it go so; we'l see
what will become of this business;
it begins to drive bravely: we are
got thus far that <hi>children</hi> do not
<hi>desire</hi> or <hi>seek society.</hi> But if so, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus,</hi>
how comes it about that
they <hi>desire</hi> or <hi>seek</hi> after <hi>company.</hi> I
don't mean, that when the Nurses
back is turned, they skip out of the
cradle, and with a huge ashen Plant
run away to the next <hi>fair, Bull-bayt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or <hi>football match;</hi> but they
do not care for being in the dark:
they are discontented, and cry when
they are left alone, and love to see
now and then a <hi>humane face,</hi> if it
does not look, as if it would
bite.</p>

be for <hi>victuals.</hi> But they can't eat,
from one end of the Nation to the
other. And one <hi>child</hi> oftimes takes
delight in the company of another,
to whom it has never a load of

to eat, or suck up that other
child.</p>

                     <p>Thou art quite beside the

<hi>child</hi> doth not <hi>seek</hi> or desire <hi>society:</hi>
by <hi>society</hi> I don't mean crying for
the <hi>pap</hi> or <hi>sucking bottle,</hi> or to be
daunc'd by Dad, or to giggle it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
its <hi>Camrades:</hi> But I mean
by <hi>society,</hi> bonds, contracts, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
leagues, <hi>transferring of rights,</hi>
and such like things which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to Cities, Communities and

mean by society these sort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth

great pains. But for all that, I pray
may not I make bold to say, that

I mean <hi>actual entering</hi> into <hi>society:</hi>
that is, being ingaged in conveyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

things as I before mentioned. This

that if <hi>right reason</hi> (which, <hi>Philau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>

that all disguise of <hi>phrase</hi> was laid
aside, they would either be found
to be absolutely <hi>false,</hi> or else to be

                     <p>Alas! <hi>Sir,</hi> when you told
me (as you do in your <hi>Epistle De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory

is an arrant Wolfe,</hi> except it be for
his interest to be otherwise; That
<hi>there's no living amongst strangers

and violence;</hi> That naturally
men are all <hi>brutall, ravenous</hi> and <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious;</hi>
I say when I heard this, I
expected the whole <hi>world</hi> naturally
to be all in armes and an uproare;
tearing and worrying one another
like mad: and to hear nothing but
down with him there, hang him
with his own gutts, give him a pound
of melted lead for a <hi>julip</hi> to cool his
pluck, split him down the chine, or
flea him alive and roast him with a
couple of <hi>awles</hi> in his eyes: when I,
<hi>Philautus,</hi> heard of a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>war,</hi>
I profess, I could think of little less
than all this and so did most peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
besides: and when all comes to
all, <hi>Philautus</hi> has found out a great
<hi>moral secret,</hi> viz. That <hi>Whelps</hi> can't see
till they be nine days old, nor a <hi>child</hi>
can't speak unless it has a <hi>spoon,</hi> nor
<hi>goe</hi> to <hi>market</hi> before it can <hi>goe alone.</hi>

                     <p>Then know, <hi>Tim,</hi> that I have
reserved a reason for such <hi>sauciness,</hi>
as thine: and therefore I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
that <hi>children</hi> may not only
be said to be in a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>war</hi> meerly
because they cannot enter into
<hi>Leagues,</hi> and offer and receive <hi>termes</hi>
of <hi>peace;</hi> but that we oftimes see
that they <hi>actually gripe</hi> and <hi>demand</hi>
things to which they have not the
least right or title; which if denyed,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41569:49"/>
they presently out of fury cry,
quarrell, fight, and scratch poor
<hi>Nurse,</hi> or <hi>Parent</hi> it self: now this,
<hi>Tim,</hi> does not only <hi>demonstrate</hi> their
naturall dispositions to <hi>war;</hi> but
that without any affront, reason
or pretence of justice, they actually
fall on, and have no respect at all
to our <hi>meums</hi> and <hi>tuums.</hi>

                     <p>I was fully perswaded, <hi>Sir,</hi>
by that and some other instances,
that <hi>children</hi> doe not know the exact

wee'l have no wind at all: but only

and amongst the rest of the <hi>great

<hi>well complexioned, upright Gentlemen:</hi>
about <hi>fifteen hands</hi> high: which shall
all happen to fall upon an <hi>Island</hi> of
four hundred acres, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Isle</hi> of

                     <p>Here's at least half a load of
<hi>contradiction,</hi> in what thou hast now
said. First of all you say they shall
be <hi>upright:</hi> I pray whose <hi>Rights</hi> or
<hi>Laws</hi> can they keep or break; they
having not as yet taken any oath of
<hi>Allegiance</hi> or <hi>Supremacy?</hi> Next of all
you say they are <hi>Gentlemen:</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
so; but if they be, you must
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41569:52"/>
needs go back again, and speak for
a <hi>small dagger-cloud</hi> for their <hi>foot-boys:</hi>
and then besides all this, I see
no great necessity that you should
make them so very <hi>tall</hi> and <hi>large,</hi>
when <hi>less Mounsiers</hi> would serve as
well for a <hi>supposition.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> when I said that
they were <hi>upright Gentlemen,</hi> I only
meant that they were streight limb'd
and <hi>right up</hi> ones: and by <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
I only meant ordinary men:
But as to their stature I think I was
discreet enough: because if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
<hi>Sir,</hi> in the <hi>eighth Chapter</hi> of
your <hi>dominion;</hi> those same <hi>mush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room-men</hi>
which you ordered to
spring out of the earth, were <hi>suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to come to full maturity;</hi> and if <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
perfect men</hi> may <hi>come up,</hi> I saw
no reason but as perfect ones might
<hi>come down.</hi> And when we had once
appointed it to <hi>rain men;</hi> I thought we
had better have a <hi>shower</hi> to some
purpose, and have it rain good, <hi>stout,
speaking, understanding men,</hi> than on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>Scottish mist</hi> of <hi>Babies,</hi> which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41569:53"/>
would have entagled us agai in the

                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>But how comes in about that
you suppose these <hi>people</hi> to speak?
<hi>Speech</hi> is so very an <hi>antificial</hi> thing,
that we are forced to have <hi>Masters</hi>
and <hi>Mistresses</hi> for that very purpose;
and all the <hi>world</hi> perceives that <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
do not speak naturally.</p>

                     <p>Now could I be tempted to
go home, and spend a little time in
<hi>laughing,</hi> and not to talk one word
more: for this proves just such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>discovery</hi> as we had before: For
after much wrangling and dispute,
we found out (I remember) at last,
that a <hi>sucking Child</hi> was not fit to
command an <hi>Army,</hi> or to make a
<hi>speech</hi> at the head of it; and now
we have found out, that these same
<hi>dropt men</hi> can't enter into a <hi>league,</hi>
till they have <hi>spoken</hi> with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
neither can they <hi>speak,</hi> till they
open their <hi>mouths;</hi> and therefore
they are in a most dismal <hi>state of war;</hi>
because when they do meet, it is
possible for them to <hi>fight,</hi> having
sworn not any thing at all to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
What, <hi>Philautus,</hi> would you
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41569:55"/>
have <hi>Roger</hi> speak to the next tree to
run away in all hast, and out of <hi>pure
natural kindness,</hi> and <hi>sweet sincere hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi>
invite <hi>Dick</hi> and the rest of
the <hi>Pineyards</hi> to a <hi>Wesphalia</hi> Ham and
Pigeons? Whereas <hi>Roger</hi> never saw
any of them as yet, nor knows any
thing of their being come to <hi>Pines:</hi>
Or would you have <hi>Dick</hi> to testifie
his <hi>inward disposition</hi> to <hi>pure society</hi>
it self, grasp a whole armful of aire,
and fall to treating and covenanting,
and at last enter into a close league
therewith? The summ of all, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus,</hi>
amounts only to this; that
there are four honest <hi>Rogues</hi> come to
<hi>Town,</hi> from the four several quarters
of the <hi>world,</hi> and falling either upon
<hi>several places</hi> of the <hi>Island,</hi> or being
a <hi>great mist,</hi> or coming <hi>before day
light,</hi> they have not as yet seen one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and having not seen one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they have not as yet discoursed,
treated or compounded; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are actually in <hi>a state of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ar, i. e.</hi> they having not <hi>spoken</hi> at
all, it is impossible that they should
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41569:55"/>
have <hi>spoken</hi> to each other. Now if
you take delight in the <hi>phrase,</hi> you
may if you please call this a <hi>state of
war,</hi> a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> or what <hi>state</hi>
you will; but for my part, I think
there's nothing in it, only a small
<hi>trick</hi> of <hi>words.</hi> There's the huge
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> and <hi>another great
man</hi> that dwells t'other way: I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
made any <hi>overtures, treaty</hi> or
<hi>composition</hi> with them; and yet for
all that I don't find any <hi>grumblings</hi> or
<hi>cursings</hi> of <hi>humane nature</hi> within me,
or any <hi>prickings,</hi> and <hi>pushings</hi> forth
toward any war. Indeed I have
found my self sometimes at some
small variance with the <hi>Turk;</hi> but
that is, because his <hi>Rogues</hi> use to droll
a little too severely upon my <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
men.</hi> Neither, <hi>Philautus,</hi> would
I have you think (supposing it were
worth the while to insist upon a
<hi>phrase)</hi> that you have justified this
kind of supposed <hi>state of nature</hi> to
be a <hi>state of war,</hi> by saying, as you
somewhere do, that <hi>the state of war
is not only actual fighting,</hi> but it is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41569:56"/>
the whole time that the <hi>variance</hi> or
<hi>quarrel</hi> last. For I grant that <hi>war</hi>
consists not in the <hi>number</hi> or <hi>length</hi>
of <hi>battles,</hi> but in a <hi>readiness</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi>
to <hi>contend.</hi> But withall we
may easily conceive much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to call the <hi>intervals</hi> between <hi>bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
and <hi>battle, war;</hi> or the whole
time from <hi>proclamation</hi> thereof to
the <hi>concluding</hi> of <hi>peace;</hi> than to call
that a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>war,</hi> which has no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for any such <hi>name</hi> from any
<hi>quarrel</hi> that ever was yet, but from
one that <hi>unreasonably</hi> may be. I say,
I think, there ought to be some <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>
made between these two
<hi>states;</hi> and you your self, <hi>Philautus,</hi>
must not be too backward to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it; because of your ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
own <hi>definition</hi> of <hi>war, cap. 1. Art.</hi>
12. Where you say, that <hi>war is that
same time in which the will of conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
by force, is fully declared by
words or deeds.</hi> Now if <hi>Roger</hi> had
challenged <hi>Dick</hi> to play with him to
morrow, three first hits for the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
or that <hi>Dick</hi> had come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41569:56"/>
                        <hi>Roger,</hi> and struck up his heels,
here had been <hi>Declaration</hi> enough to
signifie and justifie <hi>war:</hi> But to say
that they are at <hi>war</hi> without either
<hi>words</hi> or <hi>deeds</hi> (only because they
have not <hi>bargain'd)</hi> is not agreeable
to what you say your self.</p>

meet, then and not else it is to be
judged that <hi>humane nature</hi> inclines
<hi>to war;</hi> or that the <hi>state of nature</hi> is
a <hi>state of war.</hi> Now I thought thou
didst go on too quick: For let me
tell thee, <hi>Tim,</hi> that that is as much
false, as I am <hi>older</hi> than <hi>thou</hi> art. For
<hi>actual fighting</hi> and destroying is not

You say in the first place that we

                     <p>Why? If by <hi>Nature</hi> one
<hi>man</hi> should love another, that is as
<hi>man,</hi> every man would equally love
every <hi>man,</hi> as being equally man;

as <hi>profit, honour,</hi> or other things

a thing standing right up (like a

to say now. What dost think

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>However, <hi>Philautus,</hi> if I had
been there, rather than my tongue
should have catch'd cold, I'd have
said over the <hi>alphabet,</hi> or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
or other; if it had been only
this. <hi>viz.</hi> We see indeed Castles,
Walls, Draw-bridges, Guards, Guns,
Swords, Doors, Locks, and the
like. But surely it is not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary to say that all this care
is taken and these defences made,
because <hi>Humane Nature</hi> at first was,
and in generall still is a <hi>Whore,</hi> a
<hi>Bitch,</hi> a <hi>Drab,</hi> a <hi>Cut-purse,</hi> &amp;c. But
because there be <hi>Doggs, Foxes, Hoggs,
Children, Fooles, Madmen, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
Thieves, Pyrats</hi> and <hi>Philauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
And upon that accompt (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the wickedness of the
<hi>world)</hi> it is a most dangerous and
frightfull thing to leave the <hi>Dairy-door</hi>
open: for who knowes, but
on a suddain the Sow, having some
small scruples about <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41569:65"/>
little thoughts, and <hi>invading</hi> the
<hi>Milk-bowles</hi> should rejoyce in the
confusion. And in like manner I
am almost throughly convinced,
that if I have a <hi>Diamond</hi> of consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
value, it is not the safest way
to fling it into the <hi>shoe-hole,</hi> or to
lay it in the <hi>window</hi> amongst the <hi>Bay-leaves:</hi>
because perhaps the <hi>waggish
Ratts,</hi> to make me spend candle,
may carry it away, and hide it up
in the <hi>cock-loft;</hi> or a <hi>child</hi> may have
a mind to try whether it will sink or
swim, or may swallow it instead of
a new fashioned Sugar plumb; or
lastly because I may chance to have
a <hi>

of the <hi>state of nature,</hi> may make use
of the <hi>members of his body</hi> to remove
it from the place where I laid it.
And I must needs tell you, <hi>Philautus,</hi>
if a <hi>friend</hi> or so should intend me a
visit, who, I was sure, did really
believe no good or evil before the
<hi>Statutes</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> I should
count my self in all prudence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd,
to set a very strong lock up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41569:66"/>
my <hi>mustard pot.</hi> But to go on,
<hi>Philautus,</hi> you observe besides from
Constables and watches, that <hi>man</hi>
is a most <hi>dreadfull creature:</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you be very sure of that conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
I would have you call to mind,
that there be such things in the
world as <hi>madmen,</hi> who may get
from their fetters, and fall to <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>houses:</hi> and there be such things
as <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>fift Monarcy-men,</hi>
whose religious frenzy may disturb
the peace: and there be also such
things which in the morning were
true <hi>lawfull men,</hi> who by night with
<hi>intemperance</hi> have lost that <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi>
and these for a time may be
as troublesome in the streets, as a
<hi>wild Boar</hi> or <hi>Ox:</hi> And lastly there
may be here and there some besides,
call'd <hi>Pilferers,</hi> and <hi>Thieves,</hi> who
count it a piece of dull pedantry to
live by any <hi>set forme</hi> and <hi>profession,</hi>
or to be guided by any <hi>reason,</hi> or
to stand in any <hi>Lawes:</hi> and for you
to conclude from hence, that <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature</hi> in general' is a <hi>shirking,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41569:66"/>
rooking, pilfering, padding nature,</hi>
is as extravagant, as to say that the
chief of <hi>mankind</hi> are perfectly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted,
and that the true <hi>state</hi> of
<hi>nature</hi> is a state of <hi>perpetuall drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness.</hi>
And what if most <hi>Nations</hi>
have Guards, and Castles, and be
upon defence? you must not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that all men are <hi>Rogues,</hi> because
<hi>Alexander</hi> had a mind to try an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
and to see how much
mischief he could doe in his whole
life-time: or because the <hi>Caesars</hi>
spoiled many <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> &amp; brought
them into slavery, for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
jest of <hi>pure Latin,</hi> and <hi>Roman
liberty:</hi> or because the <hi>Turk</hi> gave
two pence for a <hi>Pigeon</hi> to tell him
from above that <hi>all the earth was
his.</hi> You know, <hi>Philautus,</hi> our own
<hi>Nation</hi> never wanted <hi>Horses, Ships,
Men</hi> and <hi>valour</hi> to have tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
down many of its <hi>Neighbours:</hi>
but such have been the <hi>equity</hi>
and <hi>generosity</hi> of our <hi>Kings</hi> as (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

and seeing that we do not <hi>know</hi>

me, <hi>Philautus;</hi> I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
your putting all those <hi>words</hi>
and forty more into practice. Ride
with eight <hi>suspecting pistols,</hi> and half

of <hi>anticipating Musqueteers</hi> walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
before you, and as many <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugating

blunderbuss</hi> upon the top of
your stairs; put on a <hi>head-piece</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of a <hi>quilted cap,</hi> and sleep in
perfect armour: or if this be not
sufficient, beg leave of his <hi>Majesty</hi>
that you may have a <hi>bed</hi> set up in
the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> or surrender your
self <hi>every night</hi> to the <hi>Lievtenant</hi> of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41569:67"/>
the <hi>Tower;</hi> and let him be extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
obliged, that you awake in

as much care of your self, as you
think most just, (for you know your
worth best;) but from your own <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust</hi>
and <hi>fear,</hi> I do earnestly desire
that you would not determine any
thing concerning the general <hi>disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>temper</hi> of <hi>humane nature;</hi>
and that if a <hi>mouse</hi> comes to lick
the save-all, you would not alarum
the whole <hi>Christian world,</hi> and cry
out that the <hi>Turk</hi> is landed. This
I say is all that I desire of you; for
when you tell us that there be
<hi>Thieves,</hi> and that we don't know
them, and if we did, we do not
know what day we may meet them,
this was very well and very fully
understood by every <hi>Carrier</hi> and
<hi>Drover</hi> many years before you writ
your <hi>Politicks:</hi> and now since you
have such an excellet gift of making
things plain, be pleased to exercise a
little upon <hi>t'other reason,</hi> why men
that are in the <hi>state of nature</hi> do
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41569:68"/>
choose to enter into <hi>society.</hi> For,
as for people compounding out of

<hi>own sake,</hi> I now fully understand.
As I remember you seemed to say
further, that <hi>society</hi> was a thing
meerly by chance, because that no

any <hi>right</hi> or <hi>pretence</hi> to any part of

of <hi>intrinsecal</hi> and <hi>essential right</hi> and
<hi>wrong, good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> and the like;

                     <p>As for the latter part of your

obliged to take present notice:
Wherein you say, that by <hi>nature</hi> no
man has any <hi>right</hi> to any <hi>part</hi> of this
<hi>world;</hi> which if true, then our <hi>four
natural Gallants</hi> have perfectly lost
their Journey, and must forthwith
entreat the <hi>Sun,</hi> to draw them back

is this <hi>objection</hi> in? Thou talkest just
as if thou camest reeking hot from

thee that these <hi>people</hi> that came late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
down, are very wellcome, and
may live very happily; if they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
and <hi>agree</hi> so to live: But
till they have <hi>agreed</hi> and <hi>bargained,</hi>
not any one of them can possibly
claim any peculiar right or interest
in the very least spot of the whole

<hi>Ionas Moore</hi> is not as yet come
to divide, and set out the <hi>ground,</hi>
and to call this piece <hi>starve-crow,</hi>
and t'other <hi>long acre;</hi> and because
the <hi>white posts</hi> or <hi>blew balls</hi> are not

<hi>Dick</hi> has not determined what <hi>livery</hi>
to give, and what <hi>coat</hi> of <hi>arms</hi> to

there are no hedges, ditches,

cattle: Therefore say you, none
of these have any reason to demand
the least right to any part of the

                     <p>I do abominate all such
<hi>tricks,</hi> and those that devised them.
If you'l <hi>hear sence,</hi> then <hi>attend:</hi>
When I say that no man by nature
can have any <hi>estate</hi> or <hi>right;</hi> I don't
only understand thereby, that <hi>Roger</hi>
is not as yet fixed in the <hi>East,</hi> nor
the rest in their particular <hi>quarters:</hi>
but till they have <hi>bargained,</hi> they can
make no <hi>claim</hi> to any <hi>part</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi>
whatever, either in <hi>equity,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41569:70"/>
right, law</hi> or <hi>justice.</hi> Surely thou
canst not be so ignorant, but one of
those words will fall to thy share to
understand.</p>

                     <p>I thank you, <hi>Sir,</hi> that you
were so generous, as to give me such
choice: For now I understand you
as fully, as if you had blown up your
meaning into my head with a <hi>quill.</hi>
For as much as <hi>Roger</hi> forgot to bring
his black box of <hi>Evidences,</hi> and
<hi>transferred rights</hi> along with him;
and thereupon has not been able as
yet to obtain a <hi>Decree</hi> in <hi>Chauncery,</hi>

Here, where art thou (as they

and let <hi>Tim</hi> (according to <hi>Philautus</hi>'s

go and appoint a company of <hi>people</hi>

he will find never a <hi>dogg.</hi> If you

do say again, that where there is no

it is five to one, if thou dost not

                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:41569:72"/>
I am thinking thus—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, for thinking, think till

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, <hi>Sir:</hi> Suppose a man
pays down five thousand pounds for
an <hi>Estate;</hi> and accordingly receives
<hi>writings</hi> before sufficient <hi>witnesses:</hi>
And it happens that the following
night his <hi>writings</hi> are all burnt, and
his <hi>witnesses</hi> all die. What <hi>law</hi> now
has he for his money? His <hi>convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi>
are gone towards the Moon,
and his <hi>witnesses</hi> t'other way.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>Thou dost not understand,
that he of whom the <hi>Estate</hi> was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased,
may be brought upon his
oath: There's <hi>law, Tim,</hi> that thou
didst not think of.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But I'le have that <hi>man</hi> the
same night to die also; and his <hi>Heir</hi>
shall be five hundred miles off,
when the bargain was made. This
is much easier to suppose, <hi>Philautus,</hi>
than to make <hi>men</hi> out of <hi>bladders.</hi>
Now here's no <hi>Law</hi> in the case for the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41569:73"/>
                        <hi>Purchaser;</hi> but he has much <hi>right</hi>

                     <p>This 'tis to talk of <hi>Law</hi> and
not understand it: I say there's no
reason at all that he should ever
have, or enjoy the least part of the
<hi>Estate.</hi> For if this were allowed,
whenever a man wanted a good
<hi>house,</hi> and <hi>gardens,</hi> it were but say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his <hi>witnesses</hi> are dead, and
his <hi>writings</hi> lost, and he might
e'en pick his seat whereever he
pleased.</p>

                     <p>I grant you, it is not <hi>reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
i. e.</hi> it is not <hi>convenient</hi> that
there should be room made for such
pretenses: But the man notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
hath never the less <hi>right</hi> to
the <hi>Estate:</hi> which consisted in the
<hi>bargain</hi> and true performance of
<hi>Covenants;</hi> not in the Parchments,
wax and witnesses, which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
only by reason of death, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
forgetfulness, ambiguity of

as to dream that any of this is against

me? For thou hast given an instance

our business lies all this while about
the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> where there's

                     <p>And as if they could <hi>square

Doctour;</hi> that when you had
so painfully <hi>squared</hi> it for the general
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41569:74"/>
good of <hi>mankind,</hi> he should spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
go and <hi>unsquare</hi> it again. But
hold, <hi>Sir,</hi> we forget our selves: For
we are in a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> or <hi>war,</hi>
and we fall to complementing, as if
the peace were concluded: And
therefore I shall return to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
concerning <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Law.</hi>
Which, now I tell you, <hi>Philautus,</hi> I
gave not, intending therein any
great store of <hi>proof,</hi> (much less any
<hi>demonstration,</hi> as you use to do)
but I did it only to supple and soften
you into a little less difficulty of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
between that which is
<hi>right</hi> and <hi>reasonable,</hi> and that which is
according to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Realm.</hi>

                     <p>What, dost talk of suppling
of me, <hi>Tim?</hi> I prethee go home and
put thy head into a <hi>pipkin,</hi> and there
stew it, till thou gettest more wit.
What, dost think, because I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my <hi>body</hi> as a good <hi>considerable</hi>
thing, that therefore I am so great a
<hi>Coward</hi> as to submit to <hi>nonsence,</hi> and
comply with <hi>impossibilities;</hi> and to
be mistaken only because it is the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41569:74"/>
general fashion? I shall not do so,
indeed <hi>Tim:</hi> supple and soften as
long as you will. And therefore to
ruine all your hopes at once, I do
say that those <hi>four men</hi> that we have
supposed in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> have
not the least <hi>right</hi> to any part of the
Island; not only because their share
or portion is not as yet bounded and
marked out, or because they cannot
require any part by <hi>Humane law:</hi>
but besides, because <hi>Nature</hi> has given
to every one of them an absolute,
compleat, total right to every thing
that's there to be found.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What has <hi>Nature</hi> given to
<hi>Dick;</hi> suppose, a right to the whole
<hi>Kingdom:</hi> with all the profits,
priviledges, perquisites, and appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>I prethee, <hi>Tim,</hi> climb up
some high Steeple or Tower, and
wonder there. I have other busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to do than to stay only to see
thee stare at <hi>sunshine truths</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations.</hi>
What I have said, I

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Then truly <hi>Dick</hi> has reason
to speak very laudably of <hi>Nature;</hi>
for he's in a very fine thriving condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I'le have the <hi>Rogue</hi> add a pair

another for <hi>claret;</hi> in <hi>Liveries</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to the <hi>colour</hi> of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
I am resolved he shall never
fit but in a <hi>box,</hi> drink nothing but
<hi>flaskes,</hi> eat nothing that has an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>

with <hi>Indian Almanacks.</hi> But how

He must e'en try, to earn his penny

                     <p>Why so? What, because

                     <p>No; thou perverse trifler;

<hi>state</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> may do any thing
(except hurting himself) or require
any thing, was because he cannot be
<hi>injurious</hi> or <hi>unjust</hi> to any man: <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
or injustice being the breach of
some Humane laws, such as in the state
of Nature there be none.</hi> Do so
much, as go to thy <hi>Dictionary,
Tim,</hi> and see if <hi>injuria</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justitia</hi>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:41569:77"/>
be not deriv'd of <hi>jus.</hi>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>I perceive we are wheel'd
about to <hi>Westminster Hall</hi> again:
notwithstanding you promised not
to come there any more. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I see now, <hi>Philautus,</hi> 'tis in
vain to expect any better reason
from you, why <hi>Roger</hi> may get and
possess what he list: by reason
what you said just before, <hi>viz.</hi> that,
that only was <hi>injustice</hi> which was
the breach of some <hi>humane law,</hi> is
in your own <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the
tenth <hi>Article</hi> of your first <hi>Chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
So that we see whereabouts we still
are: the <hi>Parliament</hi> is not as yet
met, or at least have not as yet
made any <hi>Lawes,</hi> and wee'l call no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>unjust,</hi> but what shall be done
against somewhat that they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shall establish: and so we are
come again into the old story of
the <hi>dogg:</hi> and no further are we
likely to proceed, unless we change
<hi>injury</hi> and <hi>injustice</hi> for some other
words. And therefore let's try, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus,</hi>
if <hi>Roger</hi> may not doe that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41569:77"/>
which is <hi>hurtfull</hi> or <hi>mischievous,</hi>
or that which is <hi>unreasonable.</hi> As
suppose, when all the rest are asleep,
he should contrive some way to
pluck out all their <hi>eyes,</hi> and to suck
them instead of <hi>raw eggs.</hi> 'Tis very
ingenious, and not the least mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
or hurt at all: for the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
have not as yet declar'd
that blindness is any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
nor that such as should oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
it in others, ought to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd.</p>

                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>Thou thinkest now that thou
talkest wisely: and 'tis as like a
<hi>Woodcock</hi> as can be. For if <hi>Roger's</hi>
stomach require it, or he thinkes
that it does, <hi>Roger</hi> may certainly
doe it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, yes: He may doe it
several ways, either with a <hi>Steletto,</hi>
or a <hi>Penknife,</hi> or a pair of <hi>Pincers,</hi>
or many other ways. And so he
may contrive to lop off a <hi>legg</hi> of each
of them: and when the <hi>Parliament</hi>
meet, if they find it unjust, they
may vote it on again. But because
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41569:78"/>
we may take occasion to talk a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more of this by and by, wee'l
go on, and see if these people
may not be guilty of doing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
that which is <hi>unreasonable.</hi>

the <hi>Magistrate</hi> has no reason
at all to be angry, or to think himself
checked &amp; affronted; if there be some
such things that decree themselves to
be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> long before <hi>Terme</hi>
begins; <hi>viz.</hi> in that same supposed
<hi>Vacation</hi> of yours, the <hi>state of Nature.</hi>
For, when he comes to open, and
give sentence, he will not only find
much work done to his hands, but
he'l find besides that hereby he'l be

and towards his deciding
such matters as require deciding,
and which do belong to his place
and profession to decide. But as for
those things we have been now
speaking of, he must not by any
means go about to alter or repeal
them: For, if he should, it would
be altogether as vain, as to call a
<hi>Council</hi> to make two and three to be
nineteen; or to issue out an order
against the next <hi>Eclipse,</hi> or to mount
all the <hi>Canons</hi> at the <hi>Tower</hi> against

take leave of thy friends; for thou
hast said that, which will prove thy
utter destruction. I do grant indeed
that <hi>intemperance</hi> is very silly and
unreasonable; not because it is so
in it self, but because (now, <hi>Tim,</hi> keep
thy eye fixed) I say again, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis inpolitick, and perfectly
against my interest: for it makes
me obnoxious to many <hi>dangers,</hi> and
several <hi>diseases;</hi> and besides it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
and weakens the use of my
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41569:87"/>
                        <hi>reason,</hi> and so renders me unable

                     <p>Truly, <hi>Philautus,</hi> I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
look upon <hi>temperance</hi> to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
so good to kill <hi>Rats,</hi> as
<hi>Arsnick</hi> and <hi>Raysons;</hi> nor to carry

be given, why it ought to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of before the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the <hi>Magistrates</hi> determination
therein, then (as was before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned)
you are not so great a <hi>dispeller
of Clouds,</hi> as you promised to be,
when you said, that <hi>by firm reasons
you would demonstrate that there was
no good or evil till the Supreme Power
had set it out:</hi> and therefore at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
I resolve to defer speaking to
<hi>self interest;</hi> and shall shew you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>rarity.</hi> What think you of
<hi>faithfulness, i. e.</hi> of keeping your

Is it not a very reasonable
thing, though there were never a

of my <hi>fundamental wares:</hi> for to
<hi>perform Contracts,</hi> or to <hi>keep trust</hi> is
my <hi>second Law of Nature.</hi> That is,
when people are resolved to end the
<hi>state of war,</hi> by relinquishing their
<hi>right</hi> to all things, it is very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
that <hi>Contracts</hi> should be stood
to, for they direct to <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>self-defence.</hi>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But is it not a <hi>good</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>
thing in it self to <hi>perform
Contracts,</hi> in the very <hi>state of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>

                     <p>What time didst thou go to
bed last night, <hi>Tim?</hi> What, would
you have a thing good, before there
be any such thing at all? You ask
whether it be not good to stand to
<hi>Contracts;</hi> when 'tis supposed, that
there has not been so much as one
ragg dealt for in the whole <hi>world.</hi>

                     <p>For all that, I can conceive
it very <hi>just</hi> and <hi>reasonable</hi> for a man
to keep his word, although he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41569:88"/>
spoke as yet, nor perhaps never
shall. For suppose there were not
one drop of <hi>Liquor</hi> in the whole
<hi>Island,</hi> that we have been talking
of; yet I count it as <hi>unreasonable</hi> for
<hi>Roger</hi> to be drunk, as if he were just
ready to set the great <hi>pitcher</hi> to his
mouth, and had sufficient matter to
proceed upon. And it seems, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
to most men (except your self,
<hi>Philautus)</hi> a very <hi>unnatural</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just</hi>
thing for a <hi>Iudge</hi> or <hi>Arbiter</hi> to
incline to either side; though there
never was as yet one Case put to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi>

                     <p>Thou hast gone on, <hi>Tim,</hi> in
thy careless shuffling way, I know
not whither: And now I must <hi>dash</hi>
thee all in pieces, and tell thee; that
thou talkest like one not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
in my Writings: for if thou
hadst, thou wouldst there have found
no less than twenty <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi>
things, all fetched from <hi>reason;</hi> such
as <hi>faithfulness, mercy, humility, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
reproach, ingratitude, &amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:41569:88"/>
which I call my <hi>Laws of Nature.</hi> But
here's the pinch of the business, and
that which thou didst never attend
to; these things I say are <hi>good</hi> and
<hi>bad,</hi> not because they are so inwardly
in themselves, but because they either
conduce to peace in general, or are
for a man's own quiet and safety, or
for his health, or profit, or recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or for the advantage of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
or Relations, or are a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of these: in short, because they
are for, or against a man's <hi>interest.</hi>

                     <p>This was a great <hi>dash</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<hi>Philautus;</hi> and I have impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
more by it, than by all that you
have said I know not how long:
for if we be discoursing concerning
some action, or disposition of mind
that is <hi>good;</hi> and if the same chance
to prove convenient either to <hi>King</hi>
or <hi>Subject, Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> for my
self or any body else, for <hi>this life</hi>
or <hi>next:</hi> That is, if it be good for
any thing that has but a name, then
is it not <hi>good</hi> in it self, but <hi>good</hi>
upon another account; which, let
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41569:89"/>
it be what it will, with a little art<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of phrase may be so twisted, as
it shall certainly be all driven upon
your common shoar of <hi>interest.</hi>
Truly, <hi>Philautus,</hi> I can scarce tell
what you would have meant by
things being <hi>good in themselves,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you would have them only to
be pictured with pretty eyes, mouths
and lips; or have a man get the
<hi>vertues</hi> and hang them upon several
strings, or tye them to the end of
some sticks, and so sing over his most
excellent and dainty <hi>Iustice,</hi> his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
amiable <hi>Temperance,</hi> his bright
angelical <hi>Mercy,</hi> and the like. But
I might have taken much less pains,
<hi>Philautus,</hi> to have shewn against
you, that all <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> does not
depend either upon <hi>self interest,</hi> or
<hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I did shew you one place,

said, that a man in the very <hi>state of

the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> which is all
one, according to your self, as to
say, that a man may act against <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
before there be any <hi>positive
Laws;</hi> and that's all that I desire
you would acknowledge: Neither
do I suppose, that you did intend to
excuse your self, by what you say a
little after, <hi>viz. If any man pretend
somewhat to tend necessarily to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
which yet he himself doth
not confidently believe so, he may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
against the Laws of Nature:</hi> For
this is a further acknowledgement
of what you said before; and shews
plainly that <hi>hypocrisie</hi> in the very
<hi>state of Nature</hi> is an <hi>unreasonable</hi> thing.</p>

say that</hi> the Laws of nature in the

                     <p>I remember you say this, in

But, if you had not forgot,
what you had said upon the 18. <hi>Art.</hi>
of your 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> you would have
granted that some <hi>natural Laws</hi> do

but there are certain natural Laws
whose Exercise <hi>(I pray mind that

                     <p>No great purchase, <hi>Sir;</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I do think that the <hi>second Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

                     <p>If you please, <hi>Sir,</hi> you may
so explain your self: But however,
if you your self, <hi>Philautus,</hi> will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
upon me only <hi>one or two Laws</hi>
that ought to be observed in the
<hi>state of Nature,</hi> I take it more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than if any body else had given
me <hi>half a score.</hi>

                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>I always found it an endless

into any soundness of mind, (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41569:91"/>
as to <hi>Morals)</hi> who would not

And therefore I prethee, <hi>Tim,</hi> go

of; and when thou comest back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,

that thou wilt fully believe what I

in the <hi>morning</hi> as I came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I found it exactly so, as you
say. In one place there was a man
buying a <hi>cloak,</hi> as hard as ever he
could, not in the least for <hi>me,</hi> but
for <hi>himself</hi> wholly; and the <hi>seller</hi>
he claws up the money, and without
saying one word to his <hi>Neighbours,</hi>
pockets it all up: In another place
there was a <hi>Porter</hi> lying close upon
the lurch at a <hi>Tavern-door,</hi> who, had
he no <hi>interest</hi> to drive on there,
might e'en as well have been here,
upon the <hi>walks.</hi>

                     <p>Thou needest not speak any
more, <hi>Tim,</hi> for I do say thus much
unto thee, that unless thou dyest a
<hi>fool,</hi> thou wilt perceive that <hi>interest</hi>
is the very first principle of Nature,
and reason; and that men must
<hi>mind</hi> themselves if they intend to
live.</p>

                     <p>Yes, <hi>Sir:</hi> So let them; if
they doe not <hi>overmind</hi> themselves:
and cry only <hi>Milk,</hi> when they should
cry <hi>milk</hi> and <hi>water;</hi> and score up
<hi>Claret,</hi> when it should be <hi>Cider.</hi>
People ought, <hi>Sir,</hi> to take care of
themselves: but I would not have
them pick <hi>blind mens pockets,</hi> and
cheat <hi>children</hi> of there <hi>Bread</hi> and
<hi>Butter,</hi> and then admire their own
<hi>parts,</hi> and <hi>quickness</hi> of <hi>sight. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
Philautus,</hi> is a word inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

<hi>equity</hi> and <hi>reason:</hi> which, according

                     <p>I perceive <hi>Tim,</hi> that thou
art much given to delight in <hi>toys,</hi>
and to neglect things of <hi>moment.</hi> My
main reason that <hi>self interest</hi> is to
be looked upon as the first <hi>Principle</hi>
of <hi>Nature</hi> was, because I found that
<hi>every man was desirous of what was
good for him, and sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>n'd what was
hurtful and evil: and this he did by
a certain impulsion of Nature, no less
than that whereby a stone moves down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>

                     <p>By your leave, <hi>Philautus,</hi> I
think that this reason seems to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
somewhat <hi>bigger</hi> than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
but it is not so <hi>true.</hi> For
though <hi>children</hi> desire, and use
meanes to get all things that please
them; and avoid and flie back from
all things that hurt them, <hi>even as
a stone comes downward:</hi> yet it is to
be supposed that what <hi>men</hi> desire
or avoid, they do it not <hi>as a stone
comes downward,</hi> but with <hi>conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
and <hi>reason:</hi> and thereupon
ought to submit to <hi>poverty</hi> and other
<hi>inconveniences,</hi> rather than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<hi>Humane Nature,</hi> and be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of an <hi>unreasonable action.</hi> And
therefore a <hi>child</hi> that pulls hard for
a <hi>jewel,</hi> which cost the <hi>owner</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
much trouble, and many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<hi>voiages,</hi> shall be excused:
but there's little reason that a great
lasie <hi>Lubber</hi> that spends his time in
the <hi>Chimney-corner</hi> and <hi>Ale,</hi> should
snatch it away, and not <hi>cry</hi> for't
first.</p>

                     <p>If he and his <hi>family</hi> be ready
to <hi>starve,</hi> that alters the case very
much: for 'tis great pity that any

                        <hi>Starve,</hi> or not <hi>starve</hi> 'tis all
one for that: for 'tis a very <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
cordial, so that it be but his
opinion that he wants at present,
or may afterward want. For seeing
that right reason tells him that <hi>life</hi>
is to be <hi>preserved:</hi> it tells him also
(as you well advise <hi>Ch. 1. Art.</hi> 8.)
that <hi>he must use the meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it:</hi> and seeing that no man
can know when another is <hi>sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alive,</hi> so well as he himself, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(as you advise further, <hi>Art.</hi> 9.)
<hi>he is to judge what is requisite and
convenient for that purpose.</hi> And
therefore sayes the <hi>self preserver,</hi>
                        <q>There's a company of people
who, when I was out of the way,
have gon and <hi>divided</hi> the <hi>world</hi>
without asking my leave, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
my counsell, or <hi>consent:</hi> I am
sure there's no fault to be found
with <hi>Nature:</hi> for she was alwayes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41569:93"/>
very carefull, and intended eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man a sufficient share. And
therefore if they'l begin once
more, and <hi>divide</hi> all over again,
and consider all mens <hi>deserts,
strength</hi> and <hi>constitution,</hi> well and
good: But otherwise I see no
reason to stand to this <hi>blind bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain</hi>
they made in my absence.
For I find that my <hi>stomach</hi> is very
cold, and <hi>Nature</hi> that is famous
for <hi>doing nothing that is Idle,</hi> oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
calls for a glass of <hi>Wine,</hi> and
(with shame to these <hi>dividers</hi> be
it spoken) it comes not, for want
of <hi>money.</hi> I find also that my
<hi>head</hi> is much given to aking, for
want of a lighter <hi>Peruke;</hi> and for
want of a <hi>Boy</hi> to comb it, I had
lately like to have lost the use of
my <hi>Thumb.</hi> I can't doe as other
people; for my <hi>flesh</hi> is so soft
and gentle, that ordinary stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
presently <hi>plough</hi> up my <hi>Leggs:</hi>
and if I have not a <hi>Watch</hi> and a

<hi>yawn</hi> and am as <hi>chill</hi> as if I
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41569:94"/>
had an <hi>Ague.</hi> And therefore, I

                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU had received this, and
what follows, long before
this time; but I was loth
to trouble the World on purpose,
upon so small an occasion: And
therefore I rather chose to wait the
pleasure of a <hi>Friend,</hi> who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
me the running of two or three
<hi>Letters,</hi> in his <hi>Dialogue</hi> concerning
Mr. <hi>Hobbs.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
one, who was pleased to send
only a short friendly admonition
with his name to't; who being a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of great worth, piety and gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I am very sorry that he should
be so imposed upon by the heats and
raylings of others, as to give under
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41569:103"/>
his hand no better Grounds and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for his Reproof.</p>
                  <p>After him, <hi>Sir,</hi> comes a very
smart <hi>hot-spur,</hi> who like a <hi>Whis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>er</hi>
at my <hi>Lord Mayor</hi>'s Show, runs up

make room there for <hi>Euclid:</hi> bear
back, and take in ten <hi>Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
against <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Riches:</hi> and
(which is much to be wondred at)
this <hi>Gentleman, Sir,</hi> with nothing
but the poor helps of <hi>Wits Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
Godwyn</hi>'s <hi>Antiquities, Clerk</hi>'s

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wimple.</hi>
He did but whistle, and
call for his small <hi>Greek Diveling,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and if I had not made
great haste, and pull'd you back by
the Leg, you had been quite gone:
And so he had like to have served
the <hi>Academick Youngster</hi> that made
the chief of his speech of <hi>Muses,
Nosegays,</hi> and his own <hi>tenuity.</hi> He
durst not absolutely say that his name
was <hi>Nicholas Nemo;</hi> but, which is
very near unto't, he thinks it <hi>much
more probable that the Sea burns, than
that there should ever be such stuff put
together.</hi> Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> were it not for
the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Merchants</hi> Ships that
are now abroad, I had a great mind
to have <hi>fired</hi> the <hi>sea;</hi> and told it
him in <hi>Latin.</hi> However look to your
selves <hi>Ships,</hi> for I profess I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
but I must try to call to mind a
little of it. <hi>Cum tenellam meam in
dicendo peritiam, &amp; coruscantem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strorum

so much concerning <hi>Nicholas Nemo.</hi>
But these are but things by the by;
for this <hi>Authour</hi>'s masterpiece is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Wisdom;</hi> both
which he has so horribly discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
by pressing the great duties
and conveniencies of being <hi>ignorant</hi>
and <hi>poor,</hi> from the History of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi>
both <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Christian,</hi> and from
our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself and his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
that I am afraid that <hi>money</hi> it
self, as well as <hi>Learning,</hi> will go a
begging; and that it will be a very
hard matter ever to perswade either
<hi>Clergy-men</hi> or others to undergo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the trouble and scandal of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>wise</hi> or <hi>rich.</hi> It cannot but be
expected that hereupon <hi>Lands</hi> must
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41569:104"/>
necessarily fall to eight years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase,
<hi>money</hi> to fifty shillings <hi>per cent.</hi>
and as for <hi>History, Philosophy, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,</hi>
and other parts of Learning,
take one with another, and they
may fetch perhaps six pence a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shel,
heap'd as long as they'l run;
and that's all. And then for running
a man up in a corner, he is the most
severe and persecuting that you ever
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et withall. In one place of his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi>
he drives me up so very close,
concerning my writing my <hi>Book,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ither to inform my self, or others;</hi>
that I began to suspect, <hi>Sir,</hi> whether
I ever writ any <hi>Letter</hi> to you or not:
but looking upon't again, I found
at last that he only proved that I
ought not to have written one. And
this further I observe of him, that
where ever he gets any advantage,
he has no more mercy than a <hi>Tyger.</hi>
He knows, as well as I do my right
hand from my left, that I do not
much care for a bit of <hi>Greek:</hi> and
yet to vex and spight me, and to
make me tired of the world, he'l
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41569:105"/>
bring in at a venture, I know not
how much, though it be nothing at
all to the purpose. If you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<hi>Sir,</hi> we have such a saying in
<hi>English,</hi> that a man that is brought to
be very <hi>poor,</hi> is brought <hi>to great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;</hi>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, being <hi>Greek</hi> for
<hi>necessity,</hi> he thought it had been <hi>Greek</hi>
for <hi>poverty</hi> too; and so urging the
great conveniencies of <hi>poverty,</hi> to
choak me, he gives me that <hi>golden
scrap of Pythagoras,</hi> (as he calls it,)
<gap reason="foreign">

Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> after all this, it
is all one to me what the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the word is: and I had not
taken any notice of it, but only I
know as I said before he quoted it
out of malice, on purpose to make
me fret, and hang my self. And so
he does another piece of <hi>Greek,</hi> in
what he says concerning <hi>Schools; viz.</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

he tells me, <hi>plodding Aristotle
said it; and that it was as well said as
if</hi> Cartes <hi>himself had said it:</hi> and
think he, that same <gap reason="foreign">

And I'le translate it thus;
<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>changing
foundations is oftentimes of dangerous
consequence:</hi> Being, <hi>Sir,</hi> (as you

sentence should not be in <hi>Aristotle;</hi>
or if it were, it should require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
near such a glorious and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Translation.</hi> And I profess, to be
short, <hi>Sir,</hi> I was made happy, and had
my design: for (as I believe) that
sentence is no where to be found
in <hi>plodding Aristotle,</hi> but in <hi>plodding
Themistius,</hi> a <hi>plodding Commentator</hi>
upon <hi>plodding Aristotle:</hi> and besides,

that motion</hi> (not time it self) <hi>is
that which alters things, or that puts
things out of that state and condition

<hi>Themistius</hi> thus comments: <gap reason="foreign">

that is, if an old

it is not meer time that rots them,
or tumbles them down; but it is

the weather, or somewhat else that
makes holes in them, and puts them
out of their place. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> as I
told you before, it is very indifferent
to me what this and what t'other
word signifie; only I would have
had him left out the abuse, and not
have told me, that <hi>it was as well said
as if Cartes had said it;</hi> because it
is just as well, and no better; it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41569:107"/>
being a <hi>fundamental principle</hi> of his
Philosophy, that <hi>all alteration is
caused by motion.</hi>

serve for the <hi>second Answerer:</hi> after
whom comes the <hi>Doomster,</hi> or <hi>Fire</hi>

Providence, &amp;c.</hi> and raking together

and all the <hi>curses</hi> in the <hi>Bible;</hi> he
bundles up all this together, and
in as dreadful <hi>black,</hi> as ever was
branded upon wool-pack, he writes
Hieragonisticon, <hi>or an Answer to my

some few <hi>Pages,</hi> and I find all this

very little, but only told him that
he was <hi>mad,</hi> and that I was not

did think so. Perhaps, <hi>Sir,</hi> you may
have a mind to know how it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that a <hi>Sermon</hi> for <hi>Providence</hi>
should be against me, and how he
should get it in, or any thing like it.
If you remember, <hi>Sir,</hi> speaking
somewhere in my first Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the great convenience of a

it is there said, that <hi>people
should not be suffered to take away
from God's Priests, what he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed

of them:</hi> Upon which, he springs

I may do it with what</hi> Bishop Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson
<hi>says in his first</hi> Sermon ad Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam;
<hi>which possibly may do some
body or other more good, than
any complement could ever have
done you service. He speaking,</hi> Sir,
<hi>of making use of</hi> Rhetorical Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Elegancies in popular Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<hi>says thus;</hi> That as such things
are sometimes very allowable, useful
and approved of by Scripture it self;
if it be discreetly and sparingly done,
and counts those uncharitable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
that in general condemn all such
Rhetorical Ornaments as savouring of
an unsanctified spirit: So <hi>(says he)</hi> I
confess there may be a fault this way,
and (in young men especially before
their judgements are grown to a just
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41569:109"/>
ripeness) many times there is. For <hi>(as
he continues)</hi> affectation in this as in
every thing else is both tedious and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous;
and in this by so much
more than in other things, by how much
more the condition of the person, and
the nature of the business require a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
serious, grave deportment. Those
Preachers therefore by a little vanity
in this kind, take the readiest way to
bring both their own discretions into
question, and the sacred word they
handle into contempt, that play with
words as children do with a feather.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I Received your fifth <hi>Paragraph</hi>
(as you call it) long since,
wherein you tell me, that I am
the <hi>Author</hi> of a <hi>scandalous Book:</hi>
and if I had the very next day
sent you word back again, that I
am not the <hi>Author</hi> of any such
<hi>Book;</hi> I had given you just as full
an answer, as you have given
reasons that I am so. For that
great service, <hi>Sir,</hi> that you have
done the <hi>Church,</hi> and are able still
to doe it, I have a very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
for you: but I doe much
wonder, that you would not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
defer calling any <hi>Book scandalous,</hi>
till you had thought of some bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41569:112"/>
ways to make it appear so: or
have told me what you meant by
<hi>scandalous.</hi> For you know, <hi>Sir,</hi> the
word has been taken in so many
sences that there has been a time
when <hi>Almond butter</hi> has been coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>rebellion, minced Pye Idolatry,</hi>
and if a little <hi>Wine</hi> were put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
it was as ill as <hi>worshipping</hi>
the <hi>host:</hi> and to eat <hi>Custards</hi> with
<hi>spoons</hi> was abominably <hi>scand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but to be engag'd in Sack-posse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

up to the eyes, with <hi>Ladles,</hi> was
<hi>Christian, Orthodox,</hi> and <hi>Brotherly.</hi>
Therefore when you say that that
<hi>Book</hi> is <hi>scandalous,</hi> if you mean that
it puts men in mind of their follies,
that it abates the glory of: some
mens preaching, that some people
now are longer making their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
if you mean that some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
it, wish that it never had been
Printed, are very angry, may are
staring raving mad; I know then
that it is so very <hi>scandalous,</hi> that
there be those that are lovers of
themselves and only of their own
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41569:112"/>
way, that at a venture they wish
the Author hang'd, a thousand and a
thousand times over.</p>
                  <p>But if you meant any thing more
by <hi>scandalous,</hi> I wish you had made
it out. For I would not have you
think, <hi>Sir,</hi> that you have done
enough towards it, only by saying
(as you doe) that <hi>I am puffed
up, that if I had known the man
that preached upon Weep not,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>I ought to have cryed: That my
Book has given offence to diverse

when you design'd me a <hi>Paragraph,</hi>
and to call my Book <hi>scandalous;</hi>
you intended some better reasons,
if you had not forgot them. But
<hi>I pray, Sir,</hi> how come you to
think that I was puffed up? I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
<hi>Sir,</hi> I do'nt find my constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be a whit more <hi>scandalous</hi>
than formerly: My pulse beates
neither faster nor loftier: the same
girdle-still takes me in. I neither
sleep deeper, nor eat more. I have
not I confess lately examin'd my
foretop; that possibly may be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
started forth; but otherwise I
know of no alteration in my
self.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Sir,</hi> you'd have me to
have <hi>cryed and pitied him that
preached upon Weep not</hi> &amp;c. <hi>rather
than have</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I pray, Sir,</hi> to
what purpose? that man is quiet
in his grave, and I did it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he or his <hi>Executors</hi> had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

affronted, or offended me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but because I knew of no better
instance to represent the vanity of
such kind of idle <hi>shreddings:</hi> and
to put an end to the extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of them. I intended to vex
no man now alive in the whole
world, not to please and delight
my self in triumphing over the
imprudences of the dead: but yet,
for all that, some people are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to think, that I am a <hi>Devil</hi>
I know not how big. However,
my Conscience tells me, what
was my design: and I bless God
Almighty that he put it into my
mind, and that I was enabled to
finish it.</p>
                  <p>Neither would I have you, <hi>Sir,</hi>
so over-confident that that same

yours: they being as eminent for

acknowledg them to be without all

and such who were born much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
fourty years since, (for if
they had not, with some they
would not be worth sixpence a
hundred) that at the first reading
thought the design to be honest,
and the Book still to be usefull: and
if I be puffed up with any thing
(as you think I am, <hi>Sir,</hi>) it is not
I'le assure you with any jest, story
or gloss, that you there find; but to

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>ALthough for your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
and service, you
have appointed me to be
<hi>young Shimei, Fanatical skip-jack,
Secretary to a Committee of plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Ministers, and Secretary besides
to another company that believe no
life after this</hi> (which is very nigh,
as bad as the former) yet, for my
part, I am fully resolved to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
my selfe to you, only by the
way of <hi>dear Sir, sweet Sir,</hi> and
sometimes <hi>plainly, Sir.</hi> For if I
should goe and call you <hi>Giles</hi> of
of <hi>Tilbury, Philip</hi> of <hi>Southampton,
Gabriel</hi> of <hi>Doncaster,</hi> or the like;
your name perhaps all this while
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41569:117"/>
may be <hi>Zoroaster, Zerubbabell,
Boreas</hi> or <hi>Boanerges.</hi> But let it be
what it will, and live where you
can, on this side or beyond <hi>Trent:</hi>
nay, live as far as <hi>Barwick</hi> upon
<hi>Twede, Sir</hi> still holds good, and
will find you out there.</p>
                  <p>And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> in the first place;
I must return you many thanks, for
your extraordinary kindness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, in respect of what I
found from your <hi>Brother Answerer,
W. S.</hi> For though you tell me
(p. 26.) that <hi>he was too civill to
his old acquaintance, and too free
and prodigall in his concessions:</hi>
and though by your <hi>fiery</hi> and <hi>fierce
Latin, (facit indignatio)</hi> you put
me into a most dismall fright,
and had like to have made me
miscarry: Yet I plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
where there is any thing of
sound and substantial tenderness at
the bottom, nature cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
long, but must needs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
some of its sweetnesses. For
whereas severe <hi>W. S.</hi> confin'd me
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41569:117"/>
wholly to <hi>cracking of Nutts;</hi> you
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> pleased, <hi>Sir,</hi> to give me my
choice of happiness and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For when I am altogether
tired and scorch'd with chasing
<hi>Butterflies,</hi> then have I your most
gracious leave to retire either to
my <hi>pilling of strawes,</hi> or to coole
<hi>myself,</hi> and <hi>my chicken broth,</hi> or
to call in at the <hi>Market Cross,</hi> and
rest my self in the <hi>Pillory;</hi> a very
<hi>laudable place,</hi> and allowed of by
<hi>Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, I say, I must upon
all occasions, acknowledge my self
to be yours, for these and many the
like affectionate expressions, in your
<hi>Vindication:</hi> which, when I well
consider, are so very sweet and
engaging, that I must need hold
my self obliged, for your sake, at
any time, either to skip off a <hi>Steeple,</hi>
or to make an end of that odd jobb
of work which <hi>Nicanor Seleucus</hi>
left unfinished between the <hi>Euxin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
and <hi>Caspian</hi> seas (if you be very
sure, that it was ever begun, for I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41569:118"/>
have a scurvy fellow that doubts
of it:) nay, when my hand is in, I
care not a farthing, if I carry on
that other <hi>massy</hi> business in <hi>Achaia;</hi> for
what's <hi>massiness</hi> to me, when there's
a friend in the case. In short, <hi>Sir,</hi> you
cannot easily devise a task, to which
I shall be unwilling, unless it be to
<hi>answer</hi> your <hi>Book.</hi> And, as to
that, I must by all meanes beg
your pardon; being not at all in
the humour, to reply to that which
was fully answered, long before it
was printed; <hi>viz.</hi> in my <hi>second
Letter</hi> called <hi>Observations:</hi> upon
which you have some short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
in a <hi>Postscript:</hi> and if
you had reflected but a little more,
I am confident you might have
easily perswaded your self to have
burnt your <hi>Copy.</hi> For in all your
<hi>Vindication,</hi> if any man, that does
but understand sence from words,
can shew me but six lines that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to Argument, or Objection,
that was not half a year before urged
by <hi>W. S.</hi> and to which some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41569:118"/>
was not thereupon made;
then will I oblige my self to get
all your <hi>Book</hi> by heart (which I
would not doe for a small matter)
or be at the charge, to procure
some body to turn it into most state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Heroick</hi> Verse.</p>
                  <p>Now, I do suppose, it may be
convenient for you to call this (as
you doe all that I say) <hi>a flam,</hi> a
<hi>whisker,</hi> a <hi>Caprice,</hi> a piece of <hi>spight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        </gap>alice, calumny</hi> and <hi>spleen.</hi> But I
care not for that: for if the same
<hi>whole world</hi> (to which you so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
appeal) be not of my opinion,
I'le give you all my interest in it,
for those same <hi>three poor pennies,</hi>
which, you know, <hi>is the full price
of my planet.</hi> If you please, <hi>Sir,</hi>
we'l try two or three places. My
<hi>friend W. S.</hi> comes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to dissent from me, as to the
business of schooling. For says h<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
(p. 37.) <hi>Though the understanding
that is in man does indeed early
discover it self, yet memory is the
great storehouse of understanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:41569:119"/>
and if the memory be sufficiently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
at schoole, it will lay a good
foundation for the perfecting the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
afterwards.</hi> This was
<hi>W. S.</hi> his opinion, and objection:
to whom I reply'd, your <hi>Humble ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi>
W. S. and some little more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
according as I was able. I
know not how long after, out
comes the <hi>Vindicationer,</hi> and
spruces up this objection, with some
fine bedeckings, and embellish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and a needless quotation out
of <hi>Plato,</hi> and brushes forth, as if he
had discovered a third <hi>Indies;</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Every body knows but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner
of the Clergy, that Children
have a moist and supple brain,
like soft wax capable of any impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and that memory is the most
early faculty of the soul, which exerts
it self in the very dawning of sense,
and cogitation, (whereupon</hi> Plato
<hi>calls it the mother of the Muses)
and is in its prime and meridian vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
before Imagination or Phancy,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41569:119"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uch less understanding and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
come perfectly to them.</hi> Now,
<hi>Sir,</hi> doe you think that I am
such a fool and owle, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to any such thing as this?
You tell me that a <hi>childs brain is
like soft wax:</hi> and I tell you,
that if you had put to your <hi>soft
wax, plaister</hi> of <hi>Paris, Puff'd past,
Curds</hi> and <hi>Apple-sauce,</hi> I would not
have answered you one word.
And what do I care if <hi>Plato</hi> calls
memory the <hi>Mother</hi> of the <hi>Maids?</hi>
I have nothing to say against <hi>Plato:</hi>
but I have only this to say, that
if that be the opinion not only of
<hi>Plato,</hi> but of the <hi>Brachmans</hi> and
<hi>Gymnosophists</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> the <hi>Bards</hi>

Indeed, as to what I said, of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

differ a little in your accompts.
For all that <hi>W. S.</hi> objected was,
that it is more proper to learn
those things which I mentioned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
But that you may be

                  <p>In like manner, there is some

your believing that there

As for modest <hi>W. S.</hi> he only

<hi>it is very strange if it should be so:</hi>
but he does not defy all reason,
that might be given: not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

consider of it, half a year after the
reason was repeated out of my first
letter, you fall on to purpose,
and challenge all the <hi>Logicks</hi> in
<hi>Europe</hi> to make it out. I wish with
all my heart, <hi>Sir,</hi> you had not

                  <p>I must confess, that there be two or
three things against my <hi>Letter,</hi> that
are near upon as <hi>massy</hi> as the very
<hi>Isthhmus</hi> it self; that wound me for
ever, and make me groan again;
which were not at all taken notice
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41569:121"/>
of by <hi>W. S.</hi> but whether he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked
them out of friendship, or
tenderness of nature, or weakness of
eyes or understanding, I am not able
to say; but sure I am he saies not one
word of them: The first that I took
notice of is <hi>pag.</hi> 38. where you are
very severe upon me for maintaining
that a <hi>break-fast</hi> is like a <hi>fast;</hi> and
that <hi>any Text in the Bible is more like
an ingenious Picture, than a Break-fast
is like a fast;</hi> and <hi>you desire the World
to judge, if it be not a very odd simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi>
Now because this is an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
new objection, wherein my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
is much concern'd, and a
matter of so great moment, that it
is quoted again, as an everlasting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
to me, therefore I must answer
as warily and distinctly as the case
will admit of: which I shall do in
these three following Propositions.
First, I confess, grant, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that a <hi>break-fast</hi> strictly and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
taken, is not at all like a <hi>fast:</hi>
In the second place, I do lay down
and hold (and resolve to do it to my
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41569:122"/>
dying day) that a <hi>Break-fast</hi> may be
as dreadful as a <hi>fast;</hi> provided it be
an <hi>old Parliament one;</hi> for that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the case very much: for the
clearing of this, turn to plodding <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,
de oppositis.</hi> In the last place
I do most stiffly maintain, that I never
said that a <hi>Break-fast is as dreadful as
an old Parliament fast:</hi> but I'le tell
you what I said, that <hi>the repetition
day for the grammar is usually as
dreadful as an old Parliament fast:</hi>
and fourteen lines after, I said, (and
will say it again for all you) that <hi>to
be bound to get two or three hundred
Verses out of</hi> Homer <hi>for break-fast,</hi> is
no very pleasant task. Now I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it was a spiteful, <hi>fanatical, skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jack
trick</hi> of mine, that I did not
right down say, that a <hi>break fast is
like a fast;</hi> (the two words are but
fourteen lines distant one from the
other;) for then you might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
the Title of the <hi>accusation,</hi>
that was to be written under
me—<hi>The Authour of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Clergy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41569:122"/>
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ies that a fast is like a break-fast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another thing that was wholly
forgotten by <hi>W. S.</hi> is that he takes no
notice at all, how greatly conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
it might be, if there were pretty
store of such as were <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi>
mixed with the rest of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy:</hi>
for as you very well observe
<hi>pag.</hi> 21. this makes up the <hi>harmony
of things: for,</hi> say you, <hi>were there
not an</hi> Ignoramus <hi>or two amongst the
Lawyers, some Quacks and Empiricks
amongst Physicians, some Idiots in the
Schools of Philosophers, some dun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es in
the member of perended schollars, and
some poor Gentry amongst the rich; there
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> be no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of things;</hi> not
any at all, most certainly: but all
the <hi>clergy</hi> would be as dull as a <hi>bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is also one thing more that
you urge against me, <hi>p.</hi> 93. that must
go wholly for your own; and it is
this; <hi>Supposing a Vicar has but a groat
in the house, it is a most unimaginable
thing, that he should break such an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and spend his penny.</hi> Now
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41569:123"/>
I durst not for my ears, go about to
make any reply to this: because you
say <hi>it is a calumny that has so little of
probability in it, that the Divel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
cannot believe it:</hi> and I have no
mind at all to dispute with him: and
therefore this must be registred and
allowed of as an unanswerable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against me; and wholly of
your own invention. I'le take care
it shall be fil'd amongst the <hi>Gazetts</hi>
and <hi>Philosophical News-books.</hi> But
indeed as to the advantage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of using of <hi>Latin</hi> in <hi>Sermons,</hi>
where no body understands it; I
must needs do <hi>W. S.</hi> so much right,
as to confess, it was not altogether
forgotten by him; but withall it
must never be denied but that the
four Reasons that you have added,
have so very much strengthened and
advanced that business, that <hi>W. S.</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come in for above a <hi>fifth part</hi> of
the glory. For, first of all say you,
<hi>It may be convenient for the Minister,
to quote out of the learned, Greek or
Latin,</hi> though no body understands
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41569:123"/>
it, to distinguish himself from such
who preach altogether in <hi>English</hi> at
<hi>Conventicles.</hi> Admirably well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived!
for if they were distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by nothing else, but by observing
the <hi>Canons</hi> and the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Vniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
it would be very hard to know
one from t'other. Secondly, <hi>becaus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
Authority is a more effectual Argument</hi>
ad hominem, <hi>than a Demonstration.</hi>
That must needs be, because it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that these same <hi>homines</hi> do not
understand a word of it; and so it
must work most wonderfully and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually.
Thirdly, it is very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient;
for, <hi>though the people do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
a tittle of it, yet so long as they
understand more than they can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
remember, it is well enough.</hi> O
'tis extraordinary well! And lastly,
because <hi>a man may so preach in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
that all people shall not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
him;</hi> (that is, if he gives his
mind to it, and makes it his business:)

and not be so angry, as to answer
your <hi>Book.</hi> Nay, more than that, I
intend to be reconciled to you, to
love you, and entertain some hopes
of you, upon condition you'l pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
me three or four things, which I
must heartily request of you: and if
all the World do not say that they
are very seasonable and proper for
your Constitution, I'le undertake ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to beg any thing again.</p>
                  <p>In the first place therefore I do
most earnestly request of you, that
you do not for the future print any
<hi>quibbles.</hi> Be as merry as you please,
and as witty as you can afford; but
for one so extraordinary full of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,</hi>

<hi>shoulder</hi> of <hi>mutton</hi> to a <hi>dish of wild
fowl,</hi> for such an one to play and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
with words will certainly in time
very much abate your reputation,
and more than that weaken your ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
parts. What an easie matter
had it been for you, when you were
speaking of <hi>English Disputations</hi> and
<hi>Declamations</hi> being used in St <hi>Pauls;</hi>
to have said, that it was allowed of
by the Usurper, or by <hi>Oliver</hi> the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant?</hi>
but you must go and say <hi>it
was connived at by one</hi> Tyrannus, <hi>but
you did not mean him in the Acts.</hi> It
was great pity indeed that you did
not mean him, because he was dead
five or six hundred years before St.
<hi>Pauls</hi> was built. In like manner,
when you tell us, <hi>pag.</hi> 75. that <hi>it is
not at all likely that star-board and
lar-board, &amp;c. should ever come into a
Sermon, since Pulpits made of Ships
beaks have been out of fashion:</hi> You
had better have given any other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of its being unlikely, than that:
for though by chance I take the Jest
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41569:125"/>
of it, because I have read <hi>Godwin's
Antiquities:</hi> yet how shall those poor
Readers make shift to admire you,
that do not understand the full signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of <hi>Rostrum,</hi> and the History
of <hi>Roman Pulpits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I desire also that you would consider
that there be some <hi>phansies</hi> which at
their first <hi>foundation</hi> were very good
and laudable; but when they have
been torn, and tossed up and down,
by every body, for an hundred years
together, they then become tiresome,
and degenerate into all the iniquity
and nauseousness of a <hi>quibble.</hi> For
example; suppose you have a mind
to abuse a man to death, and to tell
him that he talks like an <hi>Apothecary:</hi>
do so; spare him not at all, but down
with him, and make the Rogue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ashamed of his folly, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaryship:</hi>
but (if you love the
prosperity of your Family) I desire
by all means, that you do not train
it in with a Story of <hi>Doctor</hi> three or
four lines before; telling him that
<hi>for such a thing to be so or so is indeed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41569:125"/>
the opinion of one Doctor; but what if
be should talk all the while like an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary.</hi>
So to tell a man that he is
an <hi>Hogshead,</hi> is searching questionless,
and goes very deep; but if you put
<hi>empty</hi> before it, and tell him that
he is an <hi>empty Hogshead,</hi> then I count
there's little hopes of life: but if he
chance to find the word <hi>Tun</hi> within
five or six lines of this abuse, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
takes heart thereupon, begins
to crawl again, and does not care at
all for dying.</p>
                  <p>We must alwaies grant, <hi>Sir,</hi> that it
was very well done of him, who first
observed that <hi>where God had his
Church, the Divel had his Chappel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
and it was pretty well done of him,
that observed the same in the second
place; but to go on, and observe it
over, and over, and over again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all doubt, does take very much
away from the primitive glory of
your observation. And thus <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las

of them, by too much using
is so utterly worn out, that they
will work no more than the powder
of an old post.</p>
                  <p>But amongst all <hi>quibbles,</hi> as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to flourish and be for ever fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,

                  <p>Now, I would not have you think
me so spiteful and malicious, as to
say, that there is nothing of real wit
in your Vindication: for let people
say what they will, and carp, and
catch, and except, and caprice, yet
they are forced to acknowledge in
spight of malice and calumny, that
there are in the whole <hi>Vindication,</hi>

you may know what is approved of,
how to value your self, and to do
well again when occasion requires.
The first happy thing that is approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of by all, is your putting in that
<hi>scrap</hi> (as you call it) <hi>of the Poet</hi>
                     <q>—Quid enim tentar nocebit?</q>
And then your saying immediately
after, that you did it on purpose, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>you knew it would trouble me
vilely;</hi> and I'le assure you it was
well ghessed; for I hate such a <hi>scrap</hi>
of <hi>Latin,</hi> as I do a <hi>Viper</hi> or <hi>Toad:</hi>
and though I made shift to take a
slumber of seven or eight hours that
night; yet I found that your <hi>Poet</hi>
rejounced next morning most horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:
and I'le assure you, it cost me a
glass of <hi>aqua mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with him, to be quiet. The next hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
that they all grant for good
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41569:128"/>
and very allowable, is your telling
me that <hi>you had got ground of me,
more than I did allow the Vicar for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Glebe.</hi> It was well observed; for I
do confess I do allow him but a little.
The next is (that is allowed) your
calling <hi>Cicero's son Mark a codshead:</hi>
they acknowledge it to be well said,
and true; for the <hi>Rogue</hi> proved not
otherwise. A fourth is your forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Roman Lady's Bitch's name
that</hi> Thesmopolis <hi>had the tuition of:</hi>
these are all that I can get to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
allowed. I have put in hard,
I'le assure you, in all companies, for
two or three more: as for example;
<hi>the Papist and the Puritan being tyed
together like</hi> Sampson's <hi>Foxes:</hi> I liked
it well enough, and have beseeched
them to let it pass for a phansie: but
I could never get the Rogues in a
good humour to do it. For, they say,
that <hi>Sampson's Foxes</hi> have been so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
long, and so very often tied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that it is high time now to part
them. It may be, because something
very like it is to be found in a <hi>printed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41569:129"/>
Sermon,</hi> which was preached thirty
eight years ago; it is no <hi>flam,</hi> nor
<hi>whisker:</hi> it is the 43. Page upon the
right hand. Yours go thus: viz.
<hi>Papist and Puritan like</hi> Sampson'<hi>s
Foxes, though looking and running two
several wayes, yet are ever joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the tayl:</hi> My Authour has it
thus; viz. <hi>the Separatists and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi>
(there's for your <hi>Puritans</hi> and
<hi>Papists) consequently to their other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

like</hi> Sampson'<hi>s Foxes, tyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the tayls to set all on fire, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their faces look quite contrary

two Stories you tell, <hi>pag.</hi> 41. how
that <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was a Midwife) could not make his
Scollars bring forth any Science, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they had understanding to conceive
it: and that it was ill done of</hi> Cicero
<hi>that he did not examine the boy</hi> Mark'<hi>s
parts before he went to</hi> Athens. But
I profess, (I know not how) it came
at last into my mind, that I had learnt
this at School; and looking into my
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41569:129"/>
                     <hi>Clerk's formulae</hi> (out of which I used
to steal my <hi>Themes)</hi> upon that close
and elegant discourse, <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them both in the very beginning of
the <hi>Speech,</hi> viz. <hi>Socrates,</hi> &amp;c. But
this I must confess was Mr. <hi>Clerk</hi>'s
rudeness: for if he had taken care
(as he ought to have done) to have
placed those two <hi>historical observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
a little deeper into that great
Controversie, you might then have
been supposed to have fetched them
from some other <hi>Authour,</hi> that was
nearer to the <hi>Original.</hi> I have heard
very often mention made of your
calling a <hi>dish of wild fowl a Pyramid:</hi>
but whether they approve of it or
laugh at it, I cannot yet certainly
tell: (when I certainly know you
shall have an accompt.) But I must
seriously tell you that as to the <hi>beards
being made of certain she Asses manes,</hi>
I have very little hopes of putting
that off; (and I am somewhat afraid
that the <hi>shoulder of Mutton</hi> or <hi>Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,</hi>
will lie upon my hand;) but you
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41569:130"/>
may be sure I'le do my best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
Perhaps you may think it
convenient to write some small
thing, and explain it: but if it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
goes off for a phansie, seeing there
be three or four that <hi>Hell</hi> it self can't
except against, especially that of the
<hi>chasing-dish being an Hypothesis</hi> which
I had like to have forgot; the truth
of it is, it was a very pretty thought,
and I am confident will alwaies be
so accompted.</p>
                  <p>Now, I must confess to you, that this
same phrase of <hi>pretty thought,</hi> is none
of my own; but (as I remember)
'tis in some late <hi>Play:</hi> which I thought
fit to tell you, that you may be sure
of what you ghess, <hi>that I do sometimes

care, I beseech you, of <hi>necking</hi> your

very wary of calling that <hi>Euclid</hi> that

to make such a thing out, or that
you did not much question but that
you should do it, and that very plain
too; people would not then have
called for their <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Compasses:</hi>
but to say, that you would make it

And if any one desires to see <hi>Euclid</hi>

so: but my <hi>Adversary</hi> holds and
maintains, not only that there is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41569:135"/>
not so much as one now in the
whole Nation: but shews it to be
impossible that there ever was one,
or ever shall be one. And for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all this he only layes down one
very small <hi>request,</hi> viz. That no
man can present himself to a <hi>Living:</hi>
from whence it follows as fast as
hops, that some body else must doe
it (for no man can be himself, and
some body else with all the little
<hi>thingams</hi> about him <hi>Secundum idem,

to be examined, who this some
body is. And it will be found to
be either the <hi>King</hi> himself, or some
<hi>Nobleman,</hi> or <hi>Colledge,</hi> or <hi>Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
or <hi>private Gentleman</hi> (for these

                     <hi>Sir,</hi> to press this upon you only
in two or three instances. If you
remember, <hi>Sir,</hi> at the very first <hi>Page</hi>
of all your <hi>Book,</hi> you fall into a
most dismall strong fit, that <hi>T. B.</hi> and
<hi>R. L.</hi> are all one: and that they
are intended only for blinds, to
cheat and gull the world. Now I
must in the first place tell you that
<hi>W. S.</hi> was the first that found out
this; and therefore you must not
look upon your self as the <hi>Author</hi>
of that <hi>suspicion:</hi> only he did
not make so good a <hi>quibble</hi> as you
did. But to go on, <hi>Sir,</hi> I pray
why are you so very mistrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?
what? have you bespoak or
bought up all the <hi>R. Ls</hi> in the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that you will not let a man
have one? or is the <hi>family</hi> so very
small, that amongst them all, there
should not be one poor dear <hi>R. L.</hi> that
should fall to my share? fear not, <hi>Sir;</hi>
for upon my word if you were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with them, so well as I am,
you would acknowledge the <hi>R. Ls</hi> to
be a very large, &amp; spreading <hi>family:</hi>

or am in no hast of Commencing,

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> you tell me <hi>(pag.</hi> 84.)
that <hi>you have a fine story for me,
and that you will give me the honour
to bear a considerable part in it.</hi>
Now, I tell you, that I doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to receive my Honour from
you, nor any disgrace, nor to be
concerned in any story that you
can tell, unless you can find out
where my <hi>Bastards</hi> are at Nurse.
Can't you live where you lift, and
let me do so too. I shall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41569:141"/>
after you, I'le assure you;
nay I would not know you, if you
should lay me down half a Crown
towards it. I tell you therefore
once again, I do'nt live any where
nor never intend (as far as you
shall know) to live any where, but
only to <hi>exist,</hi> after that manner
you provide for the younger Clergy.
But, say you, I must needs know
him, and have him live somewhere,
or else the best story and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
piece of wit in my whole
Book, will be utterly spoiled. Well,
because I am willing to encourage
all witty attempts though they be
never so slender, therefore for once
I'le hear some of your fine story
(upon condition you'l engage never
to ghess again.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Belike then in the first place
you give me to understand, that</hi>
in your travails you met with a
certain Covent where there was an
ancient Pigeon-house, but the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
were all fled. <hi>The best way
certainly will be to roast a</hi> Cat, <hi>and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41569:142"/>
besprinkle her with</hi> cumming seed.
<hi>They say this will fetch back the
creatures again presently, if they
were not very much offended. And
thereupon,</hi> Sir, <hi>I mentioned the
business to the Cat: (for you
know</hi> Boccaline can make a Cat to
speak.) <hi>Pusse,</hi> said I, we have lost
all our <hi>Pigeons</hi> and thou knowest as
well as any man in <hi>France</hi> that a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi>
without <hi>Pigeons</hi> is like a <hi>Cow</hi>
without <hi>cymbals;</hi> and therefore if
thou wilt resign up thy self to the
<hi>Spit,</hi> and be <hi>roasted</hi> for the bringing
home of the Pigeons; <hi>thy picture shall
be hung in the Library, thou shalt
be shown with the Phoenix feathers
and Remora's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>nnes,</hi> and be constantly
commemorated with the <hi>Benefactors.
Upon which the</hi> Cat, <hi>first kissing
her foot, purr'd, and said.</hi> Sir, I
must alwayes acknowledge the great
favours that I have received from
this <hi>place:</hi> for where as for many
years I liv'd only upon course <hi>Mice</hi>
and <hi>Ratts;</hi> now I have my belly full

                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:41569:142"/>
and <hi>Circles:</hi> But as to what you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
concerning my being <hi>roasted,</hi> I
must confess I am not altogether <hi>free;</hi>
because I remember my <hi>Grandsire</hi> once
told me that it was much worse than a

But this, <hi>Sir,</hi> I'le do if you please; I'le
wait upon <hi>them,</hi> and let them know
that if they'l come home again they shall
be very civilly respected, have every

they'l come or not upon this invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I cannot yet tell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next piece of honour you do
me is to let me know that there be
people belonging to this foresaid

long.</hi> Indeed, <hi>Sir,</hi> you would
have added very much to this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of yours, if you had been pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have discovered what <hi>cubit</hi>
you meant; for amongst the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I find there be five several sorts
of <hi>Cubits:</hi> The first kind of <hi>Cubit</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:41569:143"/>
(called the common) containeth one
foot and a half, measured from the
sharp of the elbow to the point of
the middle finger. The second,
<hi>(the palm cubit)</hi> taketh one handful
more than the common. The third,
is called <hi>Regius Cubitus,</hi> or the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Cubit,</hi> which exceedeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Cubit</hi> three inches. The fourth,
is the <hi>sacred Cubit,</hi> which containeth
the Common or Vulgar <hi>Cubit</hi> dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
wanting but a quarter or fourth
part. Lastly, there is fifth <hi>Cubit,</hi>
called <hi>Geometrical,</hi> which containeth
six common <hi>Cubits.</hi> Now when you
say <hi>Above</hi> a <hi>Cubit;</hi> if you chance to
mean this same last sort of <hi>Cubits,</hi>
and withall let but <hi>Above</hi> signifie a
good way bit, the Story thereby will
become much the stranger, and your
telling of it the greater favour. But
then, as to what you tell me, that
<hi>you being invited to Dinner, observed
that every man sate down where he
pleased, and fell to, where he liked best.</hi>
Give me leave, <hi>Sir,</hi> to tell you, that
I am afraid that a great part of this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41569:143"/>
is of your own invention: for how
is it likely that every man should set
down according to his <hi>own mind,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
another might have a mind to
set in the <hi>same place:</hi> and therefore
some of them must be disappointed;
unless you will grant <hi>penetration of
bodies,</hi> which, you know, neither
your Philosopher nor mine will by
any means allow: and as to what
you say of every man falling to,
where he liked best, it is such a

he liked best! <hi>Cred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

do of a farthing</hi> Custard. <hi>And if
there be not some stop put to them,
they'l be for fresh pasture shortly;
and gobble down</hi> Archimedes <hi>too.
Nay, I wo'nt trust them, to stick at
the</hi> Polyglott Lexicon <hi>it self: There's
that</hi> snarling curr, <hi>and son of a Bitch</hi>

all Religion, believe no life but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,

of an ordinary Pillion, which
they lay under their head instead of

for <hi>Tripes</hi> and <hi>Cow-heels:</hi> but
that which they chiefly worship is a

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> I must desire of you
that you would do your self so much
right, as to bear a part in this <hi>Story.</hi>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:41569:146"/>
I hope you'l interpret all candidly:
there's no foul play at all; 'tis only
<hi>trick for trick:</hi> You may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
where your share lies; as also
in another, which I have out of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>learned Authour,</hi> such as you
chiefly trade in. You know, <hi>Sir,</hi>
you tell me, <hi>Pag.</hi> 49. how horribly
<hi>Thesmopolis</hi>'s beard was abused by a
<hi>Roman Lady's bitch.</hi> I know there
is some deadly Moral, or other, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for me; and therefore I must
desire you to take this one <hi>trick
more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Callisthenes</hi> King of <hi>Sicyon,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Daughter marriageable, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that it should be proclaimed
at the Games of <hi>Olympus,</hi> that he that
would be counted <hi>Callisthenes</hi>'s Son
in Law, should within sixty days re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to <hi>Sicyon.</hi> When many Woers
had met together, <hi>Hippoclides</hi> the
<hi>Athenian,</hi> Son of <hi>Tisander,</hi> seemed
the fittest: but when he had trod the
<hi>Laconick</hi> and <hi>Antick</hi> measure, and
had personated them with his legs and
arms, <hi>Callisthenes</hi> stomaching it, said,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41569:146"/>
O thou Son of <hi>Tisander!</hi> thou hast
danced away my Daughter. <hi>I cannot
conveniently stand to explain it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have one thing more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of you,</hi> viz. <hi>That you do not
absolutely pronounce such things to
be flams, forgeries and whiskers,
which, for ought you know, may be
all solid, and</hi> massi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>truths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have heard some people say, that
you did not write the <hi>Preface:</hi> but
do you think I would venture to say
so, unless I certainly knew it? No, I
would not do it for my right hand;
for though it is said towards the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of it, that you have some
charity for <hi>T. B.</hi> which makes me
doubt whether it be yours, (you
having not so much for him in your
whole <hi>Book,</hi> as will lie upon a
knifes point:) yet all the beginning
of it smells so very rank of your
own kind of <hi>reasoning,</hi> that it can
scarce possibly be any bodies else
but your own; unless you would
give one five or ten pieces to imitate
and labour out so much Nonsense.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41569:147"/>
I say therefore once again, suppose
you have a mind to believe that
such and such things are no where
to be found, either in <hi>printed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
nor were ever preached out
of the <hi>Pulpit:</hi> I advise you by all
means that you do not presently run
on, and say, this is a very flam;
that's a most deadly whisker; here's
right down coining, and forgery;
there's hammering and filing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance:
but rather put on your
night-cap, and be very much afraid:
bind up your head very close, and
fall to doubting, suspecting, mistrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as hard as ever you can. But, I
beseech you, go not one inch further,
till you have considered and said
thus to your self. <hi>Have I read all the</hi>
Sermons <hi>that were ever</hi> Printed
<hi>since—? and do I exactly remember
every Sentence that is in them? was
there never two men in</hi> England
<hi>preached upon the same Text? and can
I, like St.</hi> John Baptist's <hi>head, be at
all the Parishes in the Nation, at the
same time; and hear all the Sermons
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41569:147"/>
that were ever preached? If</hi> T. B.
<hi>happens to be at</hi> St. Antholins <hi>upon a</hi>
Sunday, <hi>must the</hi> bells <hi>be stopt, and
he not suffered to go to</hi> Church <hi>till I
be sent for from</hi> Edingborough? <hi>and
was there never yet one in the world,
that thought it lawful to alter his</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py?
These and such like things, I
would have you consider of, before
you be absolute, and peremptory;
for upon my word, if you do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
you'l find a very great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of it: for instance; you are
of opinion that no one ever preached
upon <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, after that manner, that
I have described; and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you heard once a man upon
that <hi>Text,</hi> that did not do so; but
only just reflected upon the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, signifying <hi>Lords.</hi> Well; take
that man to your self; much good
may he do you: but now <hi>Logick!</hi>
now <hi>Wheel-barrow!</hi> may not I, for
all that, have another man that did
insist upon it, three quarters of a
good <hi>statutable English</hi> hour toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
You may call it <hi>gliding, glanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:41569:148"/>
or <hi>reflecting;</hi> I call it preaching.
I tell you I have such an one, and
will have him in spight of your
teeth; and you shall not have one
bit of him. Neither could I possibly
ever intend to meddle with yours:
for I verily think I know whom you
mean; and I never heard that in his
whole life he did so much as name
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> upon any such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
till a long time after my <hi>Letter</hi>
was Printed: and now how can I
help it; if he be offended, or think
himself slandered. So you tell me
that <hi>you know a very worthy Person,
who preaching upon that of St.</hi> Matth.
<hi>seek ye first the Kingdom of God, did
only observe</hi> in transitu, <hi>that Monarchy
was the best Government.</hi> It may be
so; it was well for him: but, for all
that, I have, I'le assure you, one that
was in no such great hast at all. I
perceive, <hi>Sir,</hi> you are most wofully
afraid that I should want vent for
my <hi>Stories:</hi> but, I must tell you
plainly and truly, that they scram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for them so fast that I have not
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41569:148"/>
half enough: there be no less than
three several men that do offer to
take off that concerning Faith,
Hope and Charity of my hands:
but I desire them to forbear; for it
is already promised. Another sends
me word from about <hi>Epping</hi> in <hi>Essex</hi>
(it is no <hi>flam</hi> I profess) that he'l un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
for all that business about
the <hi>Text</hi> being like a <hi>Sun-Dial,</hi> if
I'd alter but two or three things; to
which I answered, No; for I had
not mine near that place by above
fourscore miles: but if he would
take it altogether, as I found it, he
should be very welcome: and I have
one that will engage, think you as
you will, not only for <hi>flanking, r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

intrenching,</hi> &amp;c. but for forty
more <hi>Military terms</hi> than I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and you must know that I did
not tell you half that <hi>Astronomy</hi>
which I heard in a <hi>Country Village;</hi>
and, for a need, I could tell you the
rest, and never use either forge, file,
or hammer. And now, me thinks,

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41569:149"/>
better for me than for you, if you
had not got it away first. <hi>Parson
slip-stockin,</hi> say you, <hi>quitted the stage
long since:</hi> so he might perhaps;
but, if he did, I'le swear he came
again: for the man died but a little
before <hi>Easter</hi> last; and <hi>the triangular
heart of man, say you, is as old as</hi>
Pauls: Let it be as old as it will;
but, for all that, I'le lay a <hi>pot</hi> and a
<hi>cake</hi> that I'le shew it in a <hi>Sermon</hi>
printed within these seven years, and
bring you at least three or four men
that have preached it within the
same compass of time. I profess,
<hi>Sir</hi> you had a great deal better not
be altogether so forward to charge
people with <hi>flams</hi> and <hi>whiskers,</hi>
when as the great <hi>rappers</hi> are wholly
upon your own side. I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that I added—<hi>Silvestrem
ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>i</hi> to quicken a little <hi>hic labor hoc
opus,</hi> and <hi>per varior casus—</hi> Which
methought went off but heavily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
and I do suppose that the
points of the <hi>Compass</hi> are not in the
<hi>Original;</hi> and no body but a <hi>Child</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:41569:149"/>
could have thought they had: and I
care not much if I let you know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that amongst that which I quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I did mistake one word; and
if you had but hit on't, then <hi>Bocca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi>
had been a <hi>Rogue</hi> to purpose. I
shall not help you in the case, make
it your business: all that I shall say is
this, that it was since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</p>
                  <p>And thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have given you my
reasons why I do not at present an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
your <hi>Book:</hi> and I desire that
the same may serve, why I never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to answer it, nor any such: the
<hi>Preface</hi> I must confess, were I not in
great hast, might deserve some little
peculiar respect, for the sake of two
as <hi>pretty, pretty objections</hi> as ever were
devised. I shall only reverentially
mention them, and keep the same
awful distance from them, as from
the rest of your <hi>Book,</hi> not daring to
meddle with such <hi>impregnable pieces.</hi>
The first horrible absurdity that I
have committed is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That I
should pretend (as I do in my <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face)</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:41569:150"/>
to have a special reverence for
the <hi>Clergy of England,</hi> and yet go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to give reasons in the <hi>Book,</hi>
why some of the <hi>Clergy</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned:
and besides (which is far
worse) should put in the word <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi>
into the very Title Page, which
is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know not how many Leagues off
from <hi>Reverence.</hi> Now, say you, let
all the men in the World make these
things hang together. Yes: let
them; for I don't intend to try.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The next absurdity that you catch
me in is this,</hi> viz. <hi>that I ought not
to have enquired into what I did;
because it was done</hi> either for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of my self, or of others:
<hi>(for belike there's no back-door to
make any escape at.)</hi> If of himself;
what need was there of its being print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Could not he have locked up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
close in his Study, and there have
enlightned and clarified his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding?
Or could not he have
gone into a Grove, and there (for his
own information) have said it over
softly to himself, and come home again
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41569:150"/>
with his lips close shut? It remains
therefore, as plain as can be, that he
must needs print his <hi>Letter,</hi> that others
might read it: and if so, then would
I fain understand, whether they knew
of it before, or not: if they did; then
this is full out as idle and absurd as to
<hi>inform</hi> himself; and <hi>if they did not,
then your only design must be</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinge
the Government: for 'tis just
like a firework in the powder-room;
it blows up all into confusion and
brings in Sedition and Schisme, <hi>as
thick as Hogs go to</hi> Rumford.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> you must needs excuse me,
that I cannot stay to reply to this,
because there's a new <hi>Brother</hi> of
yours with a deadly <hi>hard name,</hi> that
I must say two or three words to;
and therefore in great haste farwel.</p>

and hold many of these things so
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41569:154"/>
violently, that you prove them
twenty or thirty pages together.
I have therefore nothing to say to
you, but only to let you know
that I firmly believe all those things;
and I believe besides (which is no
more than the <hi>rest</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> do)
that you are quite out of your <hi>witts,</hi>
and are run away from your <hi>kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</hi>
And therefore instead of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your book, in the first place I
advise you to shave very close all
the haire off your Crown. You
need not fear turning <hi>Friar,</hi> you
may lay on an <hi>antipapal plaister,</hi> that
shall certainly secure you. Then take
away fifty or threescore ounces of
<hi>blood,</hi> at several times, according as
it shall be found that you come to
your self. If you make use of <hi>Leeches</hi>
be sure that they be well cleans'd.
If you purge, use very gentle things,
such as Manna and Syrup of roses,
which they give to <hi>children</hi> and <hi>mad
men.</hi> Till your distemper abates,
avoid all strong meats, <hi>Tobacco,</hi>
hot spices, and especially <hi>Coffee,</hi> for
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41569:155"/>
the <hi>powder</hi> has been sometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to settle into a <hi>Saracens head</hi>
at the bottom of the dish. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things have a great care of
studying, or of writing of <hi>Books,</hi> till
your head be better; and of sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon your back. For the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
will be apt to rise, and you'l
dream of nothing but <hi>invasions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions,
gun-powder plotts, spiritual
maskarados, Popery</hi> and <hi>Atheisme.</hi>
When you have observed, <hi>Sir,</hi> these
directions for a while, and that
your Brain be a little cool'd, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that you would look over your
own Book again: and then I do not
question, but that you'l freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
not only me, but all the rest of
the world that can't read it.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>JUst as the foregoing <hi>papers</hi> were
ready for the presse, I happen'd
upon seven <hi>Sermons</hi> of <hi>W. B</hi>'s,
printed since his death. Before
which, I found standing an <hi>Epistle</hi>
to the <hi>Reader</hi> from your self; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with a very large and solemn
commendation of the departed <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine's</hi>
labours, both in <hi>print</hi> and
<hi>preaching:</hi> that, think I, it is not for
me to help: for some people take
a delight to <hi>commend</hi> things only
out of <hi>spight.</hi> But, reading a little
further, I perceiv'd that, I must be
pull'd in to thrust forward <hi>W. B</hi>'s
prayses; or at least to defend his
<hi>writings</hi> against those, that thought
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41569:157"/>
them very blameable, and good for
little. For, say you, <hi>this Reverend
Author's labours have already praised
him in the gate, and his name and
memory will continue like a precious
oyntment, notwithstanding the vain
endeavours of some to make both
himself and his writings ridiculous:
for there's a late Author</hi> (meaning
I suppose <hi>T. B.) who shewes that
there's as much folly in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Conformists as of</hi> W. B.
<hi>and such as are of his way.</hi> Now,
in the first place, I must desire you
to unbelieve all that you have said:
for, this is to let you know, that
I was never able to shew any such
thing at all, and that if I should go
about it, my parts would not hold
out to do it.</p>
                  <p>Some of you I believe, were not
a little pleased with my <hi>first Letter:</hi>
Taking me for a very hopeful and
towardly <hi>Fanatick</hi> (which I could
never give my mind to as yet, and
I suppose never shall) and thought
that my designe was to ballance the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41569:157"/>
                     <hi>imprudences</hi> of some of our <hi>Clergy,</hi>
against the <hi>follies</hi> and <hi>frenzy</hi> of your
<hi>party.</hi> I tell you truly, I di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to relate very freely what
I found <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>judicious men</hi> to
blame amongst some of our <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi>
but when you appoint me to
make out, that such of our <hi>Clergy</hi>
who are too painful in dividing of
a <hi>Text,</hi> or too careless in choosing
their prefaces <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with your <hi>people,</hi> who are
not only full out as blameable in
that <hi>very kind,</hi> but whose whole
discourses under pretence of <hi>inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
and great acquaintance with
the <hi>Scriptures &amp;c.</hi> shall be nothing
else but <hi>madness</hi> and <hi>distraction,
noise, cheat,</hi> and <hi>words;</hi> I must
then tell you, that you give me a
task so very unreasonable, as I am
no ways able to perform it: and
truly, I am the more unwilling to
undertake it, because I am much
discouraged by the late <hi>writings</hi> of
two very learned and Worthy <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors:</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:41569:158"/>

to <hi>wit</hi> or <hi>understanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truly, no body need much

Church <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>so he does but
understand</hi> sence) <hi>whether it was
at all prudent, modest, or reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
for</hi> W. B. <hi>to say, that</hi> none but
God alone can rate off Satan: <hi>though
he explains himself, and shews
whence he had the</hi> Metaphor: <hi>as he
does, thus:</hi> viz. If a great Dog or
Mastiff be worrying a Child or a
Sheep, a Stranger comes and strikes
him, and calls him off, but the Dog
takes no notice of him, but when the
Master comes, he rates him off pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently;
none but the Master can do it.
So here it is, none but God that can
rate off Satan from worrying the poor
drooping soul, when it is under
temptation, none but God the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
                  <p>I desire also to know by what
Laws of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> he tells us, that
<hi>there's a time when God will hew down
sinners, and lay them upon the ground
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41569:159"/>
a drying for hell:</hi> and that <hi>people
that are upon God's Work must not
pocket up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> And many such things
which would be very harsh and nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seous
to any person of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and make him very loth
to relie upon such a <hi>judgement</hi> as
yours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> I think, that any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
will suddainly trust you again,
for a</hi> recommender <hi>of</hi> Sermons, <hi>when
he finds such</hi> idle <hi>and</hi> extravagant
cantings; <hi>as</hi> God's crossing of hands
in our salvation, of reading of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and gathering up of Evidences.
<hi>Because 'tis said in</hi> Scripture <hi>that</hi>
the last shall be first, and the first
last: <hi>Therefore saies</hi> W. B. there's
crossing of hands in our salvation;
and God doth cross hands in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of our comforts. When <hi>Jacob</hi>
blessed <hi>Joseph</hi>'s two children he
crost his hands: so God when he
comes to comfort does cross hands.
We find sometimes that the greatest
sinners are converted and soonest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41569:160"/>
Now what is this but crossing
of hands in the matter of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts;
and whence is the free Grace
of God more abundantly manifested
to the soul, but by this crossing of
hands. A rich man shall hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Kingdom of heaven; and
what is this but only to shew that
God doth often cross hands in the
matter of our salvation. Friends,
stay but a little until the day of
Iudgement, and then you will see
what crossing of hands there will be.
<hi>Now when any body reads such idle
stuff as this, I pray,</hi> Sir, <hi>do you
think he need send for a</hi> witty man
<hi>to make it</hi> ridiculous?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither need the</hi> witty man <hi>be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ent for to make him laugh at that
which</hi> W. B. <hi>has concerning peoples</hi>
reading of their Graces, <hi>viz.</hi> When a
man is under great temptations, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
and afflictions, it is a hard
thing to read his Graces; some will
say they cannot read their Graces, they
lie at the bottom: As to explain it,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41569:160"/>
take this plain comparison: There are
many Fishes in a fish-pond, but now
in rainy and foul weather the fish lie
all at the bottom, and are not to be seen;
but in fair weather the fish swim and
are visible: So if it be foul weather
upon a soul, if it be dark and gloomy
weather, the Soul cannot read his
Graces; but now when God shines
upon him, then he is inabled to read
them; yea though his Graces lie at
the bottom, as I may say, yet the poor
Soul is able to read them; and if it
be so, it is no small thing, it is no
small matter to read our Graces, our
other Graces. <hi>And I believe the</hi>
witty man <hi>may stay at home, and
yet the Work will go on apace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi>
gathering up of Evidences. You
know <hi>(sayes your</hi> Reverend Divine)
how it is with a Countrey man that
makes hay; the hay lies abroad, and
he sees a black cloud a coming, and
he calls to his men to cock up, and
gather up the hay: Why, look into the
Nation, and see what a cloud is over
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41569:161"/>
us, this calls upon the people of God
to gather up their Evidences: Here
is a black cloud over us; O all ye
people of God, gather up your Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences:
<hi>that is, cock up for</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>I am, <hi>Sir,</hi> in somewhat more
than ordinary haste, or else I would
a little further endeavour to make
you think it more convenient to
read <hi>Books</hi> better before you <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend</hi>
them, or at least not to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the <hi>World</hi> to find fault with
them. However I cannot omit to
take notice how strong <hi>W. B</hi>'s parts
were to his very dying day, at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
and applying of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I suppose, <hi>Sir,</hi> you could not
but take special notice of that mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

observation that <hi>your friend</hi> has
concerning <hi>Brotherly Love, viz.</hi>
that <hi>there are oftimes breakings and
loosings in the love of the Saints.</hi>
But this is nothing in respect of that
clear <hi>Paraphrase</hi> which from hence
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41569:161"/>
he makes upon that of <hi>St. Iohn: a
new Commandement I give unto you,
that you love one another:</hi> For says
he, because many times there are
<hi>breakings and loosings in the love of
Saints, upon this accompt it is, that
the Commandement of Love is called
a new Commandement, because it is
broken so often, and so often renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again.</hi> I would by all means have
you endeavour to get <hi>Mr. Poole</hi> to
enter down this note of your
<hi>friends,</hi> when he comes at <hi>St. Iohn:</hi>
for this will certainly add very much
to the <hi>preciousness</hi> of his <hi>name</hi> and
<hi>memory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither ought he to be forgotten,
neither I believe will he, for pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth such abundance of</hi> Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
History <hi>upon</hi> one Observation,
<hi>which he makes in his</hi> seventh Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<hi>viz.</hi> those that intend to honour
God must go forth and meet God; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
and <hi>Lot</hi> intended to honour
the Angel, and therefore they went
forth to meet him; <hi>Joseph</hi> would ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41569:162"/>
his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> and therefore
he went forth to meet him. <hi>Moses</hi>
would honour his Father <hi>Jethro,</hi> and
therefore he went forth to meet him:
<hi>Abigail</hi> would honour <hi>David,</hi> and
therefore she went forth to meet him:
<hi>Martha</hi> would honour Christ, and
therefore went out to meet him: <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>
and the believing <hi>Romans</hi>
would honour <hi>Paul,</hi> and therefore
they went forth to meet him. And so
if a man be coming to your house, if you
would honour him, you go forth to

                  <p>Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> as I told you just now,
I am in haste; but I must stay to
tell you that as I always looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>W. B.</hi> to be very <hi>sickly</hi> and <hi>crazy,</hi>
so I think you are <hi>stark mad,</hi> for
being an occasion that any <hi>such Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
as these should be sent into the
<hi>World:</hi> And yet for all this, I am
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41569:162"/>
willing to extend my charity as far
as you do yours; and to believe that
<hi>W. B.</hi> is in <hi>Heaven;</hi> but not, as you
imagine, by vertue of his <hi>preached</hi>
or <hi>printed Sermons;</hi> and I also hope
that you may follow him thither;
but by no means, because you have
recommended this <hi>Book.</hi>
