            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOtwithſtanding the great hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub this place is in at the behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Montroſſe, I</hi> ſhall give you a ſhort account of affairs. On Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt <hi>Montroſſe</hi> came hither, he was received at the end of the Towne by the Bayliffes, and ſet upon an high Cart, and tyed with a Rope, his Hat being before taken off by the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the Hangman riding upon the Filly-horſe with his Bonnet on, and a ſtaffe in his hand, and thus he was brought up through the Towne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Severall perſons have been with him
<pb facs="tcp:117819:3"/>
and upon diſcourſe he told them, that for perſonall offences hee hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all this, but juſtifies his cauſe; He cauſed a new Suite to be made for himſelfe, and came yeſterday into the Parliament-houſe with a Scarlet Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and a ſuit of pure Cloth all laid with rich Lace, a Bever, and a rich Hatband, and Scarlet ſilke-ſtockings: the Chancellor made a large ſpeech to him, diſcovering how much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he was for the Covenant, and how he hath ſince broke it: he deſired to know whether he might be free to anſwer, and being admitted, he told them his cauſe was good, and that he had not only a Commiſsion, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Orders for what he had done, from His Majeſty, which he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to be a ſervant to, and they alſo had profeſſed to comply with; and upon that account however they
<pb facs="tcp:117819:3"/>
dealt with him, yet he would owne them to be a true Parliament. And he further told them, that if they would take away his life, the world knew he regarded it not, it was a debt that muſt once be payd, and that he was willing and did much rejoyce that hee muſt goe the ſame way his Majeſty did, and it was the joy of his heart, not only to do but to ſuffer for him. His ſentence was, to be hanged upon a Galhouſe 30 foot high three houres, at <hi>Edenburgh</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſſe, to have his head ſtrucken off and hang'd upon <hi>Edenburgh Towlebooth,</hi> and his arms and legs to be hanged up in other publique towns in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as <hi>Glaſco,</hi> &amp;c. and his body to be buried, at the common burying place, in caſe his Excommunication from the Kirk were taken off, or elſe to be buried where thoſe are buried that are hanged. All the time while ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb facs="tcp:117819:4"/>
was giving, and alſo when he was executed, he ſeemed no way to be altered, or his ſpirit moved, but his ſpeech was full of compoſure, and his carriage as ſweet as ever I ſaw a man in all my daies. When they bid him kneele, hee told them hee would, hee was willing to obſerve any poſture that might manifeſt his obedience, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to them who were ſo neere conjunction with his Majeſty. It is abſolutely beleved that hee hath gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more by his death then ever hee did in his life. The Scots are liſting Forces here, and have named their Officers, they intend to make up their Army 25000, they are much ſtartled at the marching of the Engliſh Army Northwards.

            <p>THis day we entered <hi>Clonmell,</hi> which was quit by the Enemy the laſt night about nine of the clock, after a teadious ſtorme, which continned foure houres. Our men kept cloſe to the breach which they had entered all the time, ſave onely one accidentall Retreat in the ſtorm. We loſt in this ſervice Col. <hi>Cullum,</hi> and ſome other Officers, with divers private Souldiers, and ſome others wounded. The enemy had made many great preparations within, by a traverſe or croſſe worke, and ſo beat our men off, as they entered, but afterwards many of them ſtole out of the Town, and left ſome few with the inhabitants to make conditions. In the morning our Forces purſued and killed all they could light upon. The Town is a very ſtrong place, and I hope the getting of this Garriſon will be of good uſe for the gaining of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which depended upon this. The Engliſh under <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Inchequeen</hi> are come in, and as many as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired had paſſes to goe beyond Seas, and the reſt have leave to live quiet at home.
