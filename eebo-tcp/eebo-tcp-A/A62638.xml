            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>and the ſubduing of men to the obedience of the Goſpel</hi>; to have beheld the zeal of this holy man, who was all on fire for God, with what ardency of affection, and earneſtneſs of expreſſion, he perſuaded men to come in to Chriſt, and entertain the Goſpel. This were very deſirable; but ſeeing it is a thing we cannot hope for, it ſhould be ſome ſatisfaction to our curioſity, to know what St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached, what was the main Subject of his Sermons, whither he refer'd all his Diſcourſes, and what they tended to. This he tells us in the words that I have read to you, that the main ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all his Sermons was <hi>repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Occaſion of the words was briefly this. St. <hi>Paul</hi> being in his Journy to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and intending to be there by the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> that he might not be hindred in his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he reſolves to paſs by <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and only to call to him the Elders of the Church to charge them with their duty, and the care of the Church; and to engage them hereto, he tells them how
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43767:5"/>
he had carried and demeaned himſelf among them, <hi>v.</hi> 18. with what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and vigilance he had watched over them, with what affection and earneſtneſs he had preached to them, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20. And here in the Text he tells them, what had been the ſum of his Doctrine, and the ſubſtance of thoſe many Sermons he had preached among them, and what was the End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of all his Diſcourſes, <hi>viz.</hi> To perſwade men to <hi>repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Teſtifying both to the Jews and Greeks,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall explain the words a little, and then fix upon the <hi>Obſervations</hi> which I intend to ſpeak to, becauſe I deſign this only as a Preface to ſome larger Diſcourſes of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>For explication. <hi>Teſtifying,</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies to teſtifie, to prove a thing by teſtimony; ſo 'tis uſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.6. <hi>But one in a certain place teſtifyeth, ſaying.</hi> In hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Writers the word is often uſed in a Law ſenſe, for conteſting by Law, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43767:6"/>
pleading in a Cauſe; and from hence it ſignifies, earneſtly to contend or perſuade by arguments and threatnings. In the uſe of the LXX. it ſignifies to proteſt, to convince, to preſs earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to perſwade. It is uſed moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by St. <hi>Luke</hi> in a very intenſe ſignification, and is ſometimes joyned with Exhorting, which is an earneſt perſwading to a thing, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. <hi>And with many other words did he teſtifie and exhort, ſaying, ſave your ſelves from this untoward generation</hi>; and with Preaching, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.25. <hi>And when they had teſtified and preached the word of the Lord</hi>; and ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 18.5. <hi>Being preſſed in ſpirit, he teſtified to the Jews, that Jeſus was the Chriſt. Being preſſed in ſpirit,</hi> ſignifies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and vehemency in teſtifying to them, that he did vehemently endeavour to convince them; it ſeems to be equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to the expreſſion, <hi>v.</hi> 28. where it is ſaid, <hi>Apollos did mightily convince the Jews that Jeſus was the Chriſt</hi>; that is, did uſe ſuch Perſuaſions and Arguments as were ſufficient to convince; and to mention no more, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.23. <hi>He expounded and teſtified the Kingdom of God, perſwading them concerning Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Repentance toward God, and Faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> What is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43767:7"/>
the Reaſon of this appropriation of <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> the one as proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpecting <hi>God,</hi> and the other <hi>our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>? I anſwer. <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> doth properly reſpect <hi>God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the party offended, and to whom we are to be reconciled; the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Goſpel doth properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the chief and principal Object of it; ſo that by <hi>teſtifying to them repentance towards God,</hi> &amp;c. we are to underſtand that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle did earneſtly preſs and perſwade them to repent of their ſins, whereby they had offended God, and to believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>the Meſſias,</hi> the perſon that was ordained of God, and ſent to be the Saviour of the world.</p>
            <p>From the Words thus explained, this is the <hi>Obſervation</hi> that doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ariſe,</p>
            <p>That Repentance and Faith are the ſum and ſubſtance of the Goſpel; and that Miniſters ought with all earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vehemency to preſs people to repent and believe, to charge them with theſe, as their duty, and by all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43767:7"/>
means to endeavour to convince them of the neceſſity of them.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this, I ſhall do theſe <hi>Two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Shew you what is included in <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> that you may ſee that they are the ſum of the Goſpel. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Shew you the neceſſity of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is included in theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Repentance</hi>; this properly ſignifies a change of mind, a conviction that we have done amiſs, ſo as to be truly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for what we have done, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to wiſh that we had not done it. To repent, is to alter our mind, to have other apprehenſions of things than we had, to look upon that now as evil, which we did not before; from whence follows ſorrow for what we have done, and a reſolution of mind for the future not to do again that which appears now to us to be ſo evil, that we are aſhamed of it, and troubled for it, and wiſh we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43767:8"/>
had never done it. So that repentance implies a conviction that we have done ſomething that is evil and ſinful, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law we are under, and thoſe Obligations of duty and gratitude that lie upon us, whereby God is highly provoked and incenſed againſt us, and we in danger of his wrath, and the ſad effects of his diſpleaſure; upon which we are troubled, and grieved, and aſhamed for what we have done, and wiſh we had been wiſer, and had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; hereupon we reſolve never to do any thing that is ſinful, that is contrary to our duty and obligations to God, and by which we may provoke him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. Theſe <hi>two</hi> things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a true repentance, a deep ſenſe of, and ſorrow for the evils that are paſt, and the ſins that we have committed; and a firm purpoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of obedience for the future, of abſtaining from all ſin, and doing what ever is our duty; the true effect of which Reſolution, is the breaking off the practice of ſin and the courſe of a wicked life, and a conſtant courſe of obedience.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:43767:8"/>II. <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> is an effectual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Revelation of the Goſpel, the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it; the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of it, that there was ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as Jeſus Chriſt, that he was the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> propheſied of and promiſed in the Old Teſtament, that he was born and lived and preached, and wrought the Miracles that are recorded, that he was crucified, and roſe again, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into Heaven, that he was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and ſent by him into the world, by his Doctrine to inſtruct, and by the Example of his life to go before us in the way to happineſs, and by the Merit and Satisfaction of his death and ſufferings, to appeaſe and reconcile God to us, and to purchaſe for us the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our ſins and eternal life, upon the Conditions of Faith and Repentance and ſincere Obedience; and that to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to the performance of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, he promiſed and afterward ſent his holy Spirit, to accompany the preaching of his Goſpel, and to aſſiſt all Chriſtians to the doing of that which God requires of them; this is the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:43767:9"/>Now the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it contains the Precepts and Promiſes and Threatnings of it, and Faith in Chriſt includes a firm belief of all theſe; of the Precepts of the Goſpel as the matter of our duty, and the Rule of our life; and of the Promiſes and Threatnings of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as arguments to our duty, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our Obedience, and deter us from ſin. So that he that believes the Lord Jeſus, believes him to be the great Guide and Teacher ſent from God, to bring and conduct men to eternal happineſs, and that therefore we ought to hearken to him and follow him; this is to believe his <hi>Prophetical</hi> Office. He believes that he is <hi>the Author of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> and hath purchaſed for us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, ranſom from hell, and eternal life and bleſſedneſs upon the Conditions before mentioned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we ought to rely upon him only for ſalvation, to own him for our Saviour, and to beg of him his holy Spirit, which he hath promiſed to us, to enable us to perform the Conditions required on our part; this is to believe his <hi>Prieſtly</hi> Office. And laſtly, He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that the Precepts of the Goſpel,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43767:9"/>
being delivered to us by the Son of God, ought to have the authority of Laws upon us, and that we are bound to be obedient to them; and for our encouragement if we be ſo, that there is a glorious and eternal Reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to us; and for our terror if we be not, there are terrible and eternal Puniſhments threatned to us; to which Rewards, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt at the day of Judgment, will ſentence men, as the great Judge of the world; and this is to believe the <hi>Kingly</hi> Office of Chriſt. And this is the ſum of that which is meant by <hi>Faith towards the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſaith was one Subject of his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>And the proper and genuine effect of this Faith, is to live as we believe, to conform our lives to the Doctrine, to the truth whereof we aſſent. Hence it is that true Chriſtians, that is, thoſe who faſhioned their lives according to the Goſpel, are call'd <hi>believers</hi>; and the whole of Chriſtianity is many times contained in this word <hi>believing,</hi> which is the great Principle of a Chriſtian life. As in the Old Teſtament all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43767:10"/>
is expreſs'd by <hi>the fear of God</hi>; ſo in the New, by <hi>Faith in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now you ſee what is included in <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> you may eaſily judge whether theſe be not the ſum of the Goſpel, that men would forſake their ſins and turn to God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the revelation of the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Jeſus Chriſt, that is, heartily entertain it and ſubmit to it. What did Chriſt preach to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but that they would repent of their ſins, and believe on him as the <hi>Meſſias</hi>? And what did the Apoſtles preach, but to the ſame purpoſe? When St. <hi>Peter</hi> preached to the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his Sermon and the ſcope of it was to perſwade them <hi>to repent and be baptized in the name of Jeſus,</hi> that is, to profeſs their belief in him, <hi>v.</hi> 38. And ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. This is the concluſion of his diſcourſe, <hi>repent therefore and be converted</hi>; and then he propounded Chriſt to them as the Object of their Faith, being <hi>the great Prophet</hi> that was Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſhould <hi>be raiſed up among them, v.</hi> 22. So likewiſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he preached to the Jews and Gentiles, theſe were his great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43767:10"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. This is the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Sermon to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> to perſwade them to repent, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of a future Judgment; and to perſwade them to believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who was to be the Judge of the world, from the Miracle of his Reſurrection; <hi>But now he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all men every where to repent, becauſe he hath appointed a day,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whereof he hath given aſſurance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi> So that you ſee that theſe are the great Doctrines of the Goſpel, and were the ſum of the Apoſtles preaching; all their Sermons were perſwaſives to theſe two Duties of <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Neceſſity of theſe Doctrines. They are neceſſary for the eſcaping of eternal miſery, and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of everlaſting happineſs. And this will appear, by conſidering the Nature of them, and the Relation they have to both theſe.</p>
            <p>For the avoiding of eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'tis neceſſary that guilt ſhould be removed, which is an obligation to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43767:11"/>
puniſhment, and that cannot be but by pardon; and ſure we cannot imagine that God will ever pardon us without repentance; he will never remit to us the puniſhment of ſin, ſo long as we tell him we are not at all troubled for what we have done, and we are of the ſame mind ſtill, and will do the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and till we repent, we tell God this, and we may be ſure God will not caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Pardons upon thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them; ſo that Repentance is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the eſcaping of Hell.</p>
            <p>And Faith in Chriſt is neceſſary to it; for if this be the method of God's grace, not to pardon ſin without Satisfaction, and Jeſus Chriſt hath made Satisfaction for ſin by the merit of his Sufferings, and if it be neceſſary that we ſhould believe this, that the benefit hereof may redound to us; then Faith in Chriſt is neceſſary to the obtaining of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, by which the guilt of ſin is removed, that is, our obligation to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal puniſhment.</p>
            <p>And then for attaining Salvation. Chriſt having in the Goſpel revealed to us the way and means to eternal
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43767:11"/>
happineſs, it is neceſſary that we ſhould believe this Revelation of the Goſpel by Jeſus Chriſt, in order to this end. So that you ſee the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith and Repentance, becauſe without theſe we can neither eſcape Miſery, nor attain to Happineſs.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now come to draw ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from this Diſcourſe, but I will firſt give ſatisfaction to a <hi>Query</hi> or two, to which this Diſcourſe ſeems to have given occaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Query.</hi> You will ſay, why do I call <hi>Repentance</hi> a Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? It is a Doctrine of Nature. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion tells us, that when we have offended God, we ought to be ſorry for it, and reſolve to amend and reform.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I do not make the Doctrine of Repentance proper to the Goſpel, as if it had not been revealed to the world before; but becauſe it is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which the Goſpel very much preſſeth and perſwadeth men to, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the great Motives and Enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it, are peculiar to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43767:12"/>
So that the Doctrine of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, conſidered with thoſe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reaſons and Arguments to it, which the Goſpel furniſheth us withal, is in this ſenſe proper to the Goſpel, and not known to the world before.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>two</hi> Motives and Enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Repentance which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel furniſheth us with.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Aſſurance of Pardon and Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins in caſe of repentance, which is a great encouragement to repentance, and which, before the Goſpel, the world had never any firm and clear aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Aſſurance of eternal Rewards and Puniſhments after this life, which is a ſtrong Argument to perſwade men to change their lives, that they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the miſery that is threatned to impenitent ſinners, and be qualified for the Happineſs which it promiſeth to Repentance and Obedience. And this the Apoſtle tells us in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned place, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30, 31. is that which doth as it were make Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be a new Doctrine that did
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43767:12"/>
come with the Goſpel into the world, becauſe it was never before enforced with this powerful Argument; <hi>the time's of that ignorance God winked at; but now he calls upon all men every where to repent; becauſe,</hi> &amp;c. When the world was in <hi>ignorance,</hi> and had not ſuch aſſurance of a future ſtate, of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rewards and Puniſhments after this life, the Arguments to Repentance were weak and feeble in compariſon of what they now are, the neceſſity of this Duty was not ſo evident. But now God hath aſſur'd us of a future Judgment, now Exhortations to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance have a commanding power and influence upon men; ſo that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> both as it is that which is very much preſt and inculcated in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and as it hath its chief Motives and Enforcements from the Goſpel, may be ſaid to be one of the great Doctrines of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 2. Whether the preaching of <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> among thoſe who are already Chriſtians, be at all neceſſary? Becauſe it ſeems very improper, to preſs thoſe to believe in Chriſt, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perſwaded that he is the <hi>Meſſias,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:43767:13"/>
and do entertain the Hiſtory and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The <hi>Faith</hi> which the Apoſtle here means, and which he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to, is an <hi>effectual belief of the Goſpel</hi>; ſuch a Faith as hath real effects upon men, and makes them to live as they believe; ſuch a Faith as perſwades them of the need of theſe Bleſſings that the Goſpel offers, and makes them to deſire to be partakers of them, and in order thereto to be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſubmit to thoſe Terms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Holineſs and Obedience, which the Goſpel requires. This is the <hi>Faith</hi> we would perſwade men to, and there is nothing more neceſſary to be preſt upon the greateſt part of Chriſtians than this; for how few are there among thoſe who profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, who believe it in this effectual manner, ſo as to conform themſelves to it? The Faith which moſt Chriſtians pretend to, is meerly negative; they do not disbelieve the Goſpel, they do not conſider it, nor trouble themſelves about it, they do not care nor are concerned whether it be true or not; but they have not a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43767:13"/>
poſitive belief of it, they are not poſſeſt with a firm perſwaſion of the truth of thoſe matters which are contained in it; if they were, ſuch a perſwaſion would produce real and poſitive effects. Every man naturally deſires Happineſs, and 'tis impoſſible that any man that is poſſeſt with this belief, that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Happineſs it is neceſſary for him to do ſuch and ſuch things, and that if he omit or neglect them, he is unavoidably miſerable, that he ſhould not do them. Men <hi>ſay</hi> they believe this or that, but you may ſee in their lives, what it is they believe. So that the preaching of <hi>this Faith in Chriſt,</hi> which is the only true Faith, is ſtill neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Inference.</hi> If <hi>Repentance towards God,</hi> and <hi>Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> be the ſum and ſubſtance of the Goſpel, then from hence we may infer the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Chriſtian Religion, which inſiſts only upon theſe things which do tend to our Perfection and our Happineſs. <hi>Repentance</hi> tends to our recovery, and the bringing of us back as near as may be to innocence. <hi>Primus innocentiae graedus eſt non peccaſſe;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43767:14"/>
ſecundus, penitentia</hi>: and then <hi>Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> tho it be very comprehenſive, and contains many things in it, yet nothing but what is eminently for our advantage, and doth very much conduce to our happineſs. The <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> part of the Goſpel acquaints us with the Perſon and Actions of our Saviour, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth very much to our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Author and Means of our Salvation. The <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part of the Goſpel contains what God requires on our part, and the Encouragements and Arguments to our Duty, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Recompence and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the next life. The <hi>Precepts</hi> of Chriſts Doctrine are ſuch as tend exceedingly to the Perfection of our nature, being all founded in Reaſon, in the nature of God, and of a Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creature; I except only thoſe poſitive Inſtitutions of the Chriſtian Religion, the two Sacraments, which are not burthenſome, and are of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe. This is the <hi>firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. we may learn from hence what is to be the ſum and end of our Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to bring men to Repentance and

a firm belief of the Goſpel; but then it is to be conſidered, that we preach <hi>Repentance,</hi> ſo often as we preach ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt ſin in general, or any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſin or vice; and ſo often as we perſwade to holineſs in general, or to the performance of any particular Duty of Religion, or to the exerciſe of any particular Grace; for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance includes the forſaking of ſin, and a ſincere reſolution and endeavour of reformation and obedience. And we preach <hi>Repentance</hi> ſo often as we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon ſuch Conſiderations and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as may be powerful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men from ſin, and to engage them to holineſs.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43767:15"/>
Covenant between God and us, and the Conditions of it, and the way how a ſinner is juſtified and hath his ſins pardoned, the Nature and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Regeneration and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo often as we explain the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Goſpel, and the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Threatnings of it, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to convince men of the Equity of Chriſt's Commands, and to aſſure them of the Certainty of the Eternal Happineſs which the Goſpel promiſes to them that obey it, and of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Miſery which the Goſpel threatens to thoſe that are diſobedient; all this is preaching <hi>Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

            <p n="3">III. This may correct the irregular humor and itch in many people, who are not contented with this plain and wholſom food, but muſt be gratified with ſublime Notions and unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Myſteries, with pleaſant paſſages of Wit, and artificial ſtrains of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, with nice and unprofitable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes, with bold interpretations of dark Prophecies, and peremptory De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of what will happen next year, and a punctual ſtating of the time
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43767:15"/>
when <hi>Anti-Chriſt</hi> ſhall be thrown down, and <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall, and who ſhall be employed in this Work. Or if their humor lies another way, you muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your ſelf to it, by making ſharp Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon matters in preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie and debate, you muſt dip your ſtile in Gall and Vinegar, and be all Satyr and Invective againſt thoſe that differ from you, and teach people to hate one another, and to fall together by the ears; and this men call <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel preaching,</hi> and <hi>ſpeaking of Seaſonable Truths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Goſpel Preacher,</hi> and ſuch an one as may be a Patern to all others; and yet he did none of theſe; he preached what men might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and what they ought to believe and practice, in a plain and unaffected and convincing manner; he taught <hi>ſuch things as made for peace,</hi> and <hi>whereby he might edifie and build up men in their holy Faith.</hi> The Doctrines that he preached will never be unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that men ſhould leave their ſins, and believe the Goſpel, and live accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:43767:16"/>And if men muſt needs be gratified with Diſputes and Controverſies, there are theſe great Controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the ſinner to be ſtated and determined; Whether this be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to follow our own luſts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, or to endeavour to be like God, and to be conformed to him, in Goodneſs, and Mercy, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Truth, and Faithfulneſs? Whether Jeſus Chriſt be not the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> and Saviour of the world? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith and Repentance and Sincere Obedience be not the Terms of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the neceſſary Conditions of Happineſs? Whether there ſhall be a future Judgment, when all men ſhall be ſentenced according to their works? Whether there be a Heaven and Hell? Whether good men ſhall be eternally and unſpeakably happy, and wicked men extreamly and everlaſtingly miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? Theſe are the great Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of Religion, upon which we are to diſpute on God's behalf againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. God aſſerts, and ſinners deny theſe things, not in Words, but which is more emphatical and ſignificant, in their Lives and Actions. Theſe are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43767:16"/>
practical Controverſies of <hi>Faith,</hi> and it concerns every man to be reſolved and determined about them, that he may frame his life accordingly.</p>
            <p>And ſo for <hi>Repentance</hi>; God ſays, Repentance is a forſaking of ſin, and a through change and amendment of life; the ſinner ſays that it is only a formal Confeſſion, and a ſlight asking of God forgiveneſs: God calls upon us ſpeedily and forthwith to repent; the ſinner ſaith 'tis time enough, and it may ſafely be defer'd to ſickneſs or death; theſe are important Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and matters of moment. But men do not affect common Truths; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as theſe are moſt neceſſary: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed whatever is generally uſeful and beneficial, ought to be common, and not to be the leſs valued, but the more eſteemed for being ſo.</p>
            <p>And as theſe Doctrines of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> are never unſeaſonable, ſo are they more peculiarly proper when we celebrate the Holy Sacrament, which was inſtituted for a ſolemn and ſtanding Memorial of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and is one of the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43767:17"/>
Arguments and Perſwaſives to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and a good life.</p>
            <p>The Faith of the Goſpel doth more particularly reſpect the death of Chriſt; and therefore it is call'd <hi>Faith in his Blood,</hi> becauſe <hi>that</hi> is more eſpecially the Object of our Faith; the Blood of Chriſt, as it was a Seal of the truth of his Doctrine, ſo it is alſo a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Bleſſings and Benefits of the New Covenant.</p>
            <p>And it is one of the greateſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the world to repentance. In the Blood of Chriſt we may ſee our own guilt, and in the dreadful Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Son of God, the juſt deſert of our ſins; for <hi>he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows, he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities</hi>; therefore the Commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Sufferings ſhould call our ſins to remembrance, the Repreſentation of his Body broken, ſhould melt our hearts; and ſo often as we remember that <hi>his blood was ſhed for us, our eyes</hi> ſhould <hi>run down with rivers of tears</hi>; ſo often as we <hi>look upon him whom we have pierced,</hi> we ſhould <hi>mourn over him.</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:43767:17"/>
When the Son of God ſuffered, <hi>the rocks were rent in ſunder</hi>; and ſhall not the conſideration of thoſe ſufferings be effectual to break the moſt ſtony and obdurate heart?</p>
            <p>What can be more proper when we come to this Sacrament, than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of our Repentance? When we partake of this Paſſover, we ſhould <hi>eat it with bitter herbs.</hi> The moſt ſolemn Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of our Repentance fall ſhort of thoſe Sufferings which our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour underwent for our ſins; if <hi>our head were waters, and our eyes fountains of tears,</hi> we could never ſufficiently la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the curſed Effects and Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thoſe provocations which were ſo fatal to the Son of God.</p>
            <p>And that our Repentance may be real, it muſt be accompanied with the Reſolution of a better life; for if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our ſins again, <hi>we trample under foot the Son of God, and profane the Blood of the Covenant,</hi> and out of <hi>the Cup of Salvation we drink our own damnation,</hi> and turn that which ſhould ſave us into an inſtrument and Seal of our own ruin.</p>

            <p>SInce we are all ſinners, and liable to the Juſtice of God, it is a matter of great moment to our comfort and happineſs, to be rightly informed by what Means, and upon what Terms, we may be reconciled to God, and find mercy with him. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Text gives us this advice and direction, <hi>whoſo confeſſeth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh his ſin, ſhall have mercy.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Vol. 8.</note>In which words there is a great Bleſſing and Benefit declared and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſinners, upon certain Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Bleſſing and Benefit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, is <hi>the mercy and favour of God,</hi> which comprehends all the happy Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of God's mercy and goodneſs to ſinners. And the Conditions upon which this Bleſſing is promiſed are two, <hi>Confeſſion of our ſins, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of them</hi>; and theſe two contain in them, the whole nature of that great and neceſſary Duty of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, without which a ſinner can have no reaſonable hopes of the mercy of God.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Here is a Bleſſing or Benefit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, which is <hi>the mercy and favour of God.</hi> And this in the full extent of it, comprehends all the Effects of the mercy and goodneſs of God to ſinners, and doth primarily import the pardon and forgiveneſs of our ſins. And this probably <hi>Solomon</hi> did chiefly intend in this expreſſion; for ſo the <hi>mercy</hi> of God doth moſt frequently ſignifie in the Old Teſtament, <hi>viz.</hi> the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our ſins. And thus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43767:19"/>
explains it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forſake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and he will have mercy, and to our God, for he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now ſince the clear revelation of the Goſpel, the <hi>mercy</hi> of God doth not only extend to the pardon of ſin, but to power againſt it; becauſe this alſo is an Effect of God's free grace and mercy to ſinners, to enable them, by the grace of his holy Spirit, to maſter and mortifie their luſts, and to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in Goodneſs to the end.</p>
            <p>And it comprehends alſo our final pardon and abſolution at the great day, together with the glorious Reward of eternal life, which the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth, by <hi>finding mercy with the Lord in that day.</hi> And this likewiſe is promiſed to Repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord, and he ſhall ſend Jeſus Chriſt, who before was preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you</hi>; that is, that when Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43767:20"/>
who is now preached unto you ſhall come, you may receive the final ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of abſolution and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>And thus much ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of the Bleſſing and Benefit here promiſed, <hi>the mercy of God</hi>; which comprehends all the bleſſed Effects of the divine grace and goodneſs to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the preſent pardon of ſin, and power to mortifie ſin, and to perſevere in a good courſe, and our final abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution by the ſentence of the great day, together with the merciful and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reward of eternal life.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We will conſider in the next place, the Conditions upon which this Bleſſing is promiſed, and they are two, the <hi>Confeſſing</hi> and <hi>Forſaking</hi> of our ſins, <hi>whoſo confeſſeth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh his ſin, ſhall have mercy</hi>; and theſe two do contain and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the whole nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, without which a ſinner can have no reaſonable hopes to find <hi>mercy</hi> with God. I begin with the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:43767:20"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of our ſins; by which is meant a penitent acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our faults to God; to <hi>God</hi> I ſay, becauſe the Confeſſion of our ſins to <hi>men</hi> is not, generally ſpeaking, a Condition of the forgiveneſs of them, but only in ſome particular caſes, when our ſins againſt God are accompanied and complicated with ſcandal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to men. In other caſes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our ſins to men is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the pardon of them, as I ſhall more fully ſhew in the progreſs of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>All the difficulty in this matter is, that the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of our ſins is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the <hi>covering</hi> and <hi>concealing</hi> of them; <hi>he that covereth his ſin ſhall not proſper: but whoſo confeſſeth them, ſhall have mercy</hi>; but no man can hope to hide his ſin from God, and therefore confeſſion of them to God cannot be here meant. But this Objection, if it be of any force, quite excludeth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to God, as no part of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s meaning; when yet Confeſſion of our ſins to God, is granted on all hands, to be a neceſſary Condition of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43767:21"/>
forgiveneſs of them. And to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the whole ground of this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; men are ſaid in Scripture, when they do not confeſs their ſins and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of them, to hide and conceal them from God: Not to acknowledge them is as if a man went about to cover them. And thus <hi>David</hi> oppoſeth <hi>confeſſion of ſins to God,</hi> to the <hi>hiding</hi> of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. <hi>I acknowledged my ſin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid, I ſaid I will confeſs my tranſgreſſions unto the Lord</hi>; ſo that this is no reaſon, why the Text ſhould not be underſtood of the Confeſſion of our ſins to God.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the neceſſity of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſins to men (that is to the Prieſt) in order to the forgiveneſs of them, is a great point of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it being by them eſteemed a neceſſary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, but by us, ſo far from being neceſſary to be believed, that we do not believe it to be true; therefore for the clear ſtating of this matter, I ſhall briefly enquire into theſe <hi>Two</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:43767:21"/>I. Whether Confeſſion of our ſins to the Prieſt, as taught and practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the forgiveneſs of them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. How far the diſcloſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing of our ſins to the Miniſters of God is convenient upon other accounts, and for other purpoſes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Whether Confeſſion of our ſins to the Prieſt, and the manner in which it is taught and practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> be neceſſary to the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them. What manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion this is, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath moſt preciſely determined, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>Secret Confeſſion to the Prieſt alone, of all and every mortal ſin, which upon the moſt diligent ſearch and examination of our Conſciences we can remember our ſelves to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, ſince our Baptiſm; together with all the Circumſtances of thoſe ſins, which may change the nature of them; becauſe without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of theſe, the Prieſt cannot make a judgment of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43767:22"/>
and quality of mens ſins, nor impoſe fitting Penance for them.</q>
This is the Confeſſion of ſins required in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the ſame Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> without any real ground from Scripture or Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, doth moſt confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <q>to have been inſtituted by our Lord, and by the Law of God to be neceſſary to ſalvation, and to have been always practiſed in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall as briefly as I can examine both theſe Pretences, of the Divine Inſtitution, and Conſtant Practice of this kind of Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the Divine Inſtitution of it, they mainly rely upon three Texts; in the firſt of which there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all of Confeſſion, much leſs of a particular Confeſſion of all our ſins with the Circumſtances of them; in the other two there is no mention of Confeſſion to the Prieſt; and yet all this ought clearly to appear in theſe Texts, before they can ground a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution upon them; for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution is not to be founded
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43767:22"/>
upon obſcure Conſequences, but upon plain words.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> Text, and the only one upon which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> grounds the Neceſſity of Confeſſion, is <hi>John</hi> 20.23. <hi>Whoſeſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted; and whoſeſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſins ye retain, they are retained:</hi> It is a ſign they were at a great loſs for a Text to prove it, when they are glad to bring one that hath not one word in it concerning Confeſſion, nor the leaſt intimation of the neceſſity of it.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee how they manage it to their purpoſe. The Apoſtles and their Succeſſors (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) by this power of <hi>remitting</hi> and <hi>retaining ſins,</hi> are conſtituted Judges of the caſe of Penitents; but they cannot judge without hearing the Cauſe, and this infers particular Confeſſion of ſins to the Prieſt, from whence he concludes it neceſſary to the forgiveneſs of ſins.</p>
            <p>But do not the Miniſters of the Goſpel exerciſe this power of <hi>remitting
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43767:23"/>
ſins</hi> in Baptiſm? And yet particular Confeſſion of all ſins to the Prieſt is not required, no not in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Baptiſm of adult Perſons. And therefore according to them, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Confeſſion of ſin to the Prieſt, is not neceſſary to his exerciſing the power of <hi>remitting ſins,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the neceſſity of Confeſſion cannot be concluded from this Text.</p>
            <p>And to ſhew how they are puzled in this matter, <hi>Vaſquez</hi> by a ſtrange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice concludes the neceſſity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion from the power of <hi>retaining ſins</hi>; for (ſays he) if the Prieſt have a power of <hi>retaining ſins,</hi> that is of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Pardon and Abſolution to the Penitent, then he may impoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as a Condition of forgiveneſs, and not abſolve the Penitent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other terms. But ſuppoſing the Prieſt to have this unreaſonable power, this makes Confeſſion no otherwiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by Divine Inſtitution, than go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or <hi>China</hi> is, in order to the forgiveneſs of our ſins, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to any other fooliſh condition, that the Prieſt thinks fit to require;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43767:23"/>
for according to this way of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this power of <hi>retaining ſins,</hi> makes every fooliſh thing that the Prieſt ſhall impoſe upon the Penitent, to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary by Divine Command and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, this power of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi> and <hi>retaining ſins,</hi> is exerciſed by the Miniſters of the Goſpel, in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and the preaching of the Goſpel, which is call'd <hi>the word of reconciliation, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry whereof is committed to them:</hi> And thus the ancient Fathers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it; and as a great Divine told them in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> it was perhaps never expounded by any one Father concerning the buſineſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Text they alledge to this purpoſe is, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins.</hi> Here indeed is Confeſſion; but general, not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as appears by the oppoſition, <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us: but if we confeſs our ſins,</hi> that is, if we
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43767:24"/>
acknowledge our ſelves to have been ſinners: And then here is not a word of confeſſing to the Prieſt; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion here meant is plainly to God, becauſe it follows, <hi>he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins,</hi> that is, God, who is neceſſarily underſtood in the former part of the ſentence; as if it had run thus, <hi>if we confeſs our ſins to God, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Text is, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Confeſs your faults one to another, and pray one for another.</hi> And here again there is only mention of Confeſſion, but not a word of the Prieſt; and for another Reaſon, if I had been to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them, they ſhould not have preſt this Text for their ſervice in this cauſe, becauſe it does them as much hurt as good; for it is certain, the Duty of Confeſſion here enjoyned is reciprocal and mutual, <hi>confeſs your ſins one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> So that if by virtue of this Text the People are bound to confeſs their ſins to the Prieſt, the Prieſt is hereby as much obliged to confeſs his ſins to the People; which I dare ſay is more than they have a mind to prove from this

Text. The plain meaning whereof is this, that as Chriſtians ſhould be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to perform all mutual Offices of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo to aſſiſt and comfort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their Counſel and Prayers; and therefore the Apoſtle adviſeth Chriſtians when they are ſick, if at the ſame time they be under any ſpiritual trouble, by reaſon of the Guilt of any ſin lying upon their Conſciences, to lay open their caſe to one another, that ſo they may have the help of one anothers Advice and Prayers; <hi>confeſs your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed,</hi> both of your bodily and ſpiritual diſtemper: not that the Prieſt or Miniſter is here excluded; St. <hi>James</hi> had ſpoken of that particular before, that when <hi>any was ſick,</hi> he ſhould <hi>ſend for the Elders of the Church,</hi> that he might in the firſt place have the benefit of <hi>their</hi> Counſel and Prayers; and then becauſe private Chriſtians may alſo be uſeful to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in this kind, he adds, that they ſhould alſo lay open their condition and troubles <hi>to one another,</hi> that ſo they might have the help of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Advice and Prayers; and very probably all the Confeſſion here meant
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43767:25"/>
of private Chriſtians <hi>to one another</hi> is of the offences and injuries they may have been guilty of, one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that they ſhould be reconciled upon this occaſion, and as a teſtimony of their Charity, ſhould <hi>pray one for another</hi>; whereas they are bound <hi>to ſend for the Elders of the Church,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> are <hi>to pray over them,</hi> as an act not only of <hi>Charity,</hi> but of <hi>Superiority,</hi> and by virtue of their Office in the Church, a more eſpecial bleſſing being to be expected from <hi>their</hi> Prayers.</p>
            <p>Theſe three Texts are the main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from Scripture, which they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> bring to prove their auricular or ſecret Confeſſion to be of Divine Inſtitution; and woful proofs they are; which ſhews what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſhifts they are reduced to, who reſolve to maintain a bad cauſe.</p>
            <p>I proceed in the <hi>Second</hi> place, to diſcover the Falſhood of their other Pretences, that this kind of Confeſſion hath always been practiſed in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; and not only ſo, but believed abſolutely neceſſary to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43767:25"/>
of mens ſins and their eternal ſalvation.</p>
            <p>The truth of the whole matter is this; publick Confeſſion and Penance for open and ſcandalous Crimes was in uſe, and with great ſtrictneſs obſerved in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, and there was then no general Law or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, that exacted ſecret Confeſſion of ſins to the Prieſt, as a neceſſary part of repentance, and condition of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: afterward publick Penance was by degrees diſuſed, which plainly ſhews that, in the opinion of the Church, this Diſcipline, how uſeful ſoever, was not of abſolute neceſſity to reſtore men to the favour of God.</p>
            <p>In place of this came in private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the Prieſt, particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to this Office, and call'd <hi>the Penitentiary</hi>; but upon occaſion of a ſcandal that hapned, this alſo was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated by <hi>Nectarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>; which ſhews that neither was this neceſſary. And this act of <hi>Nectarius</hi> was juſtified by his Succeſſor St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who does over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver moſt expreſly teach, that Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43767:26"/>
of our ſins to men is not neceſſary to the forgiveneſs of them, but that it is ſufficient to confeſs them to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; ſo that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> does plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtand condemned by the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus for ſeveral Ages the matter reſted, till the degeneracy of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> growing towards its height, about the IX. and X. Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſome began to contend for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſecret Confeſſion, and this in the year 1215. in the IV. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Lateran</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. was decreed and eſtabliſh'd.</p>
            <p>And this is the firſt publick Law that was made in the Chriſtian Church concerning this matter, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the boaſts of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> about the antiquity of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and Practice; for <hi>Gratian,</hi> who lived about 50 years before this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, tells us, that in his time ſeveral wiſe and religious men were of the contrary opinion, and did not hold Confeſſion neceſſary by virtue of any Divine Law. Afterwards in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Florence,</hi> and eſpecially in that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43767:26"/>
of <hi>Trent,</hi> this Decree of the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> was confirmed and enlarged in many particulars, of which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given ſome account.</p>
            <p>And whereas they pretend for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the univerſal Practice not only of the paſt, but preſent Church, we are able to ſhew from clear Teſtimony of their own Writers, that Confeſſion, as taught and practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is no where elſe in uſe at this day, neither among the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> nor <hi>Indians</hi> of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> nor the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> nor the <hi>Armenians,</hi> nor the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> Churches of great antiquity and vaſt extent. And as for the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, if we may believe <hi>Gratian,</hi> and the Author of the Gloſs upon the Canon Law, the <hi>Greeks</hi> had anciently no Tradition concerning the neceſſity of Confeſſion, nor do they at this day agree with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in all points concerning it.</p>
            <p>So that, in ſhort, there is no Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor Church throughout the whole world, that bear the name of Chriſtian, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church only excepted, that doth fully embrace and maintain the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43767:27"/>
whole Doctrine of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> concerning Confeſſion; and yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their principles, the whole is of equal neceſſity to be believed, as any part of it. With what face then do they declare, that this manner of Confeſſion always was, and ſtill is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Catholick, that is in the whole Chriſtian Church?</p>
            <p>I have not time to ſhew the great and manifold inconveniences and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of this practice. How infinite a torture it is to the Conſciences of men, by entangling them in endleſs doubts and ſcruples; and how great a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal it is to the Chriſtian Profeſſion, in the lewd management of it by the Prieſts, is evident from the two Bulls of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the IV. and <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. which mention things too ſhameful to be declared; not to inſiſt upon other horrible abuſes of it to the vileſt and wickedeſt purpoſes; not ſo much to direct the Conſciences of men, as to dive into their Secrets, of which there are ſo many plain and notorious Inſtances, that they are paſt denyal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:43767:27"/>The other thing pretended for it is, that it is a great reſtraint upon men from ſin. And very probably it is ſo, to modeſt and well diſpoſed perſons: but experience ſhews how quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary an effect it hath upon others, who are the far greateſt part of mankind. Does not all the world ſee in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Countries, in the time of their Carnival, juſt before <hi>Lent,</hi> the Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſeaſon of Confeſſion, how ſcandalous a liberty men take of doing lewd and wicked things; and that for this very Reaſon, becauſe their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are preſently to be eaſed and ſcoured (as they call it) by Confeſſion and Abſolution? And they therefore take the oportunity to gratifie their luſts, and fill up the meaſure of their iniquity at that time; becauſe with one labour they can ſet their Conſciences right, and clear them of all guilt; and they look upon this as a ſpecial piece of ſpiritual good husbandry, to quit their ſcores with God at once, that ſo they may have no occaſion to trouble him, nor the Prieſt, nor themſelves again for a good while after. So that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, inſtead of being a reſtraint
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43767:28"/>
from ſin, gives great encouragement to it, by deluding men into a vain hope of obtaining the pardon of their ſins from time to time, tho they ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the practice of them; by which device, mens ſins are at once <hi>remitted</hi> and <hi>retain'd</hi>; the Prieſt remits them by Abſolution, and the penitent retains them, by going on ſtill in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of them, in hope of obtaining a new Abſolution as often as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall require. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Enquiry, namely, How far the diſcloſing and revealing our ſins to the Miniſters of God, may be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient upon other accounts and to other purpoſes of Religion? To which the Anſwer is very plain and ſhort; ſo far as is neceſſary either to the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the eaſe of mens Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>There are many Caſes wherein men, under the guilt and trouble of their ſins, can neither appeaſe their own minds, nor ſufficiently direct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without recourſe to ſome pious and prudent Guide; in theſe caſes, men
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43767:28"/>
certainly do very well, and many times prevent a great deal of trouble and perplexity to themſelves, by a timely diſcovery of their condition to ſome faithful Miniſter, in order to their direction and ſatisfaction, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they ſhall never perhaps be able to clear themſelves of the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and entanglement of their own minds, but by ſmothering their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their own breaſts, ſhall proceed from one degree of melancholy to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, till at laſt they be plunged ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in diſtraction or deſpair; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the diſcovery of their condition in time, would prove a preſent and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al remedy. And to this purpoſe, a general Confeſſion is for the moſt part ſufficient; and where there is occaſion for a more particular diſcovery, there is no need of raking into the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and foul circumſtances of mens ſins, to give that advice which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the cure and eaſe of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent; a thing ſo far from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, that it muſt needs be very grievous to every modeſt and good man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:43767:29"/>And thus far Confeſſion is not only allowed, but encouraged among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. In the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, <hi>Chemnitius</hi> tells us, that private gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Confeſſion is in uſe and practice. And <hi>Calvin</hi> freely declares, that he is ſo far from being againſt peoples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to their Paſtors to this purpoſe, that he earneſtly wiſheth it were eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where obſerved before the receiving of the Sacrament. And the ſame is the ſenſe of our own Church, laying no neceſſity upon men in this matter, but adviſing, eſpecially before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Sacrament, thoſe who have any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon their Conſciences, to repair to ſome diſcreet and faithful Miniſter of God's Word, for advice and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thus all the good uſe, which can be made of Confeſſion, may be had in our Church, without the ill Effects and Conſequences of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Confeſſion, and without laying a Yoke upon the Conſciences of men, which our Saviour never laid.</p>
            <p>And now I have, as briefly and as plainly as I could, ſtated this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between us and the Church of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43767:29"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning the neceſſity and uſe of ſecret Confeſſion to the Miniſters of God, as the proper Guides and Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of our Conſciences: But it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all hands, that Confeſſion of our ſins to <hi>God</hi> is neceſſary; and there is no doubt but it is here intended in the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> a Penitent acknowledgment of our ſins; the nature whereof I ſhall briefly explain to you.</p>
            <p>And it muſt not only be a general Confeſſion that we are ſinners; but there muſt be a particular acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſins to God, ſo far as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a particular diſcuſſion and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Conſciences, we can call them to remembrance, eſpecially our moſt heinous ſins, which our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences will not ſuffer us to forget, muſt be particularly acknowledged, with the ſeveral aggravations of them.</p>
            <p>And this Confeſſion muſt be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſuch a ſhame and ſorrow for our ſins, as produceth in us a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere reſolution to leave them, and to betake our ſelves to a better courſe. Theſe are the principal ingredients of a Penitent Confeſſion.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:43767:30"/>1. There muſt be ſhame, without which there is no hope of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Confeſſion always ſuppoſeth conviction of a fault; and he that is truly convinced that he hath done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, cannot but be aſhamed of what he hath done. And thus the Penitents in Scripture were wont to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their ſins to God; <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6. <hi>O my God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, and bluſh to lift up my face to thee my God.</hi> So <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Ch. 3.25. <hi>We lie down in our ſhame, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion covereth us; for we have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord.</hi> And ſo likewiſe <hi>Daniel,</hi> Ch. 9.5. <hi>We have ſinned, and have committed Iniquity, and done Wickedly, unto us belongeth confuſion of Face.</hi> And thus our Saviour deſcribes the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent behaviour of the Publican, as aſhamed to look up to that God whom he had offended, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13. <hi>He would not lift up ſo much as his eyes to heaven; but ſmote upon his breaſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God be merciful to me a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Confeſſion muſt be always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with great ſorrow for our ſins,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43767:30"/>
conſidering the great diſhonour we have brought to God, and the danger into which we have brought our ſelves; <hi>I will declare mine iniquity,</hi> (ſays David,) <hi>and I will be ſorry for my ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Sorrow muſt be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the degree of our Sin. If we have been very wicked, and have ſinned greatly againſt the Lord, and <hi>have mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied our tranſgreſſions,</hi> and continued long in an evil courſe, have neglected God, and <hi>forgotten him days without number,</hi> the meaſure of our ſorrow, muſt bear ſome proportion to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of our Sins; if they have been <hi>as Scarlet and Crimſon,</hi> (as the Prophet expreſſeth it) that is, of a deeper dye than ordinary, our Sorrow muſt be as deep as our Guilt; for it is not a ſlight trouble and a few tears that will waſh out ſuch ſtains.</p>
            <p>Not that tears are abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, tho' they do very well become, and moſt commonly accompany a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Repentance. All tempers are not in this alike; ſome cannot expreſs their ſorrow by tears, even then when they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43767:31"/>
are moſt inwardly and ſenſibly grieved. But if we can eaſily ſhed tears upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions; certainly <hi>rivers of tears</hi> ought to <hi>run down our eyes,</hi> becauſe we have broken Gods Laws, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and Righteous, and good Laws of ſo good a God, of ſo Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Soveraign, of ſo mighty a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, of the Founder of our Being, and the perpetual Patron and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of our lives: but if we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our tears, there muſt however be great trouble and contrition of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, eſpecially for great ſins; to be ſure to that degree as to produce the</p>
            <p n="3">3. Property I mentioned of a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Confeſſion, namely, a ſincere Reſolution to leave our ſins, and betake our ſelves to a better courſe. He does not confeſs his fault, but ſtand in it, who is not reſolved to amend. True Shame and Sorrow for our Sins is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtent with any thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to them. It argues great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and impudence to confeſs a fault and continue in it. Whenever we make Confeſſion of our ſins to God, <hi>ſurely it is meet to ſay unto him, I will not offend any more, that which I know
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43767:31"/>
not teach thou me, and if I have done in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, I will do no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>firſt</hi> part of Repentance mentioned in the Text, the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our finding mercy with God, the Penitent acknowledgment of our ſins to him. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Condition required to make us capable of the mercy of God, which is the actual <hi>forſaking</hi> of our ſins; <hi>whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall have mercy.</hi> I ſhall not go about to explain what is meant by <hi>forſaking ſin,</hi> it is that which every body can underſtand, but few will do; there lies all the difficulty. I ſhall only put you in mind, that forſaking of ſin comprehends our return to our duty, <hi>that</hi> neceſſarily follows from it. In ſins of Commiſſion, he that hath left any Vice, does thereby become maſter of the contrary Virtue, <hi>virtus eſt viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um fugere</hi>; not to be drunk, is to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; not to oppreſs, or defraud, or deal falſly, is to be Juſt and Honeſt: and for ſins of Omiſſion, the forſaking of them is nothing elſe, but the doing of thoſe Duties which we omitted and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43767:32"/>
neglected before. And therefore what <hi>Solomon</hi> here calls <hi>forſaking of ſin,</hi> is elſewhere in Scripture more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, by <hi>ceaſing to do evil, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do well. Iſa.</hi> 1.16. By forſaking our ſins and turning to God; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked man forſake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord.</hi> By turning from all our ſins, and keeping all Gods Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21. <hi>If the wicked will turn from all his ſins which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and keep all my ſtatutes, and do that which is lawful and right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is a moſt Eſſential part of Repentance, and a neceſſary conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our finding mercy with God. That part of Repentance which I have mentioned and inſiſted upon before, the Penitent acknowledgment of our ſins to God, with Shame and Sorrow for them, and a firm purpoſe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to leave them, all this is but Preparatory to the actual forſaking of them: that which perfects and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats our Repentance, is <hi>to turn from our evil ways,</hi> and <hi>to break off our ſins by righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:43767:32"/>And theſe terms of <hi>confeſſing</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking our ſins,</hi> are Reaſonable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and Honourable to God, and Profitable to us, and upon lower Terms we have no reaſon to expect the Mercy of God, nor in truth are we capable of it, either by the preſent forgiveneſs of our ſins, or the final abſolution of the great day, and the bleſſed Reward of Eternal Life. God peremptorily requires this change, as a condition of our Forgiveneſs and Happineſs; <hi>Repent and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out,</hi> Acts 3.19. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments,</hi> Matth. 19.17. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord, Heb.</hi> 12.14. And why ſhould any man hope for the Mercy of God upon other Terms, than thoſe which he hath ſo plainly and peremptorily declared?</p>
            <p>It is a mean and unworthy thought of God, to imagine that he will accept men to his favour and eternal life up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other Terms than of better obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Will any wiſe Father or Prince accept leſs from his Children and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? will they be ſatisfied with ſighs
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43767:33"/>
and tears, as well as with Obedience? And well pleaſed if they be but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy for their faults, tho' they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>never mend them? We muſt not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that to God, which would be a defect of Wiſdom and good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in any Father or Prince upon Earth. God values no part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance upon any other account, but as it tends to reclaim us to our Duty, and ends in our Reformation and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment.</p>
            <p>This is that which qualifies us for the Happineſs of another Life, and <hi>makes us meet to be made partakers of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Saints in light.</hi> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, tho' God ſhould be pleaſed to forgive us, yet we could not forgive our ſelves; and notwithſtanding the legal diſcharge from Guilt, the Sting of it would remain, and we ſhould, like our firſt Parents after they had ſinn'd, run away and <hi>hide our ſelves from God,</hi> tho' he ſpake never ſo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to us. God hath placed in every Man's mind an inexorable Judge, that will grant no Pardon and Forgiveneſs but to a reformed Penitent, to him that hath ſuch a ſenſe of the Evil of his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43767:33"/>
paſt Life, as to become a better man for the future.</p>
            <p>And whoever entertains any other notion of the Grace and Mercy of God to Sinners, confounds the Nature of Things, and does plainly overthrow the Reaſon of all Laws, which is to reſtrain men from Sin: But when it is committed, to Pardon it without A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, is to Encourage the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it, and to take away the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Veneration of thoſe Laws, which ſeem ſo ſeverely to forbid it. So that next to impunity, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mens ſins upon ſuch eaſie and unfit Terms, gives boldneſs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to ſin, and muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily in the opinion of men leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Honour and Eſteem of God's Laws.</p>
            <p>And thus I have Conſidered and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained both the Bleſſing and Benefit which is here promiſed and declared, <hi>viz. the Mercy and Favour of God,</hi> which comprehends both the preſent Forgiveneſs of our Sins, and Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and Grace to Perſevere in Goodneſs to the end, and our final
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43767:34"/>
Abſolution at the great day, and the Glorious and Merciful Reward of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life: and likewiſe the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon which this Bleſſing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Penitent <hi>acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of our ſins to God, with ſuch Shame and Sorrow for them, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a ſincere Reſolution of leaving them, and returning to a better courſe, and the <hi>actual forſaking</hi> of them, which involves in it our actual return to our Duty, and a Conſtant and Sincere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Laws of God in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture courſe of our lives.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now make ſome Application of this Diſcourſe to our ſelves. I am ſure we are all nearly concerned in it. The beſt of us have many ſins to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and forſake; ſome of us very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have need to change the whole courſe of our Lives, to put us into a capacity of the Mercy of God. This work can never be unſeaſonable; but there cannot be a more proper time for it, than when we are ſolemnly preparing our ſelves to receive the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament; in which as we do Commemorate the great Mercy of God to Mankind, ſo we do likewiſe renew
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43767:34"/>
and confirm our Covenant with him, that Holy Covenant wherein we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our ſelves to forſake our ſins, as ever we expect the forgiveneſs of them at God's hand.</p>
            <p>To perſwade us hereto, be pleaſed to conſider the Reaſonableneſs of the Thing, the infinite Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it; and which is beyond all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arguments, the abſolute Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, to make us capable of the Mercy and Forgiveneſs of God, in this World and the other, and <hi>to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from the wrath which is to come,</hi> and from thoſe terrible ſtorms of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, which will infallibly fall upon impenitent ſinners: So that we have all the Reaſon and all the Encouragement in the World, to reſolve upon a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courſe. Upon this Condition, the Mercy of God is ready to meet and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace us, God will Pardon our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt provocations, and be perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to us. So he hath declared by the Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.16. <hi>Waſh ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well. Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord, tho'
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43767:35"/>
your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; tho' they be red as crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> And what greater Encouragement can we deſire, than that upon ſo eaſie and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Terms, God ſhould be ſo ready to have an end put to all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Quarrels between him and us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I beſeech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,</hi> to take up a ſerious Reſolution <hi>to break off your ſins by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and to reform whatever, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due ſearch and tryal of your ways, you ſhall find to be amiſs in your lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I beſeech you by the Mercies of God,</hi> that <hi>Mercy</hi> which naturally <hi>leads to repentance,</hi> and which is <hi>long-ſuffering to us-ward,</hi> on purpoſe <hi>that we may not periſh, but come to repentance,</hi> which hath ſpared us ſo often, and is not yet exhauſted and tired out by our intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable obſtinacy, and innumerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations; that <hi>mercy</hi> which moved the Son of God to become man, to live among us, and to die for us; who now as it were ſpeaks to us from the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43767:35"/>
Croſs, extending his pierced Hands, and painful Arms to embrace us, and through the gaſping wounds of his ſide lets us ſee the tender and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Compaſſion of his Heart; that <hi>mercy</hi> which if we now deſpiſe it, we ſhall in vain one day implore, and catch hold of, and hang upon, to ſave us from ſinking into Eternal Perdition; that <hi>mercy,</hi> which how much ſoever we now preſume upon, will then be ſo far from interpoſing between us and the wrath of God, that it will highly inflame and exaſperate it: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever impenitent ſinners may now think, they will then certainly find that the Divine Juſtice, when it is throughly provoked, and whetted by his abuſed Mercy and Goodneſs, will be moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly ſevere, and like a Raſor ſet with Oyl, will cut the keener for its ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſider this all ye that forget God, leſt he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver: Conſider and ſhew your ſelves men, O ye tranſgreſſours!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We do conſider all this (may ſome perhaps ſay) but we have been great
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43767:36"/>
ſinners, ſo great, that we doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our caſe be not already deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
            <p>This, if it be ſenſibly ſaid, with deep Sorrow and Contrition, with that Shame and Confuſion of face, which becomes great offenders, is a good Confeſſion, and the beſt Reaſon in the World, why ye ſhould now <hi>break off your ſins</hi>: For if what you have already done, do really make your caſe ſo doubtful and difficult; do not by ſinning yet more and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, make it quite Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and paſt Remedy; do but you <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and God will yet <hi>return and have Mercy upon you.</hi> And do not ſay you cannot do it, when it muſt be done, or you are undone. Power and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty go together; when men are hard preſt they find a power which they thought they had not; and when it comes to the puſh, men can do that which they plainly ſee they either muſt do, or be ruined for ever.</p>
            <p>But after all this, I am very ſenſible how great a need there is of God's powerful Aſſiſtance in this caſe, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43767:36"/>
that it is not an ordinary reſolution, and common meaſure of God's Grace, that will reclaim thoſe who have been long habituated to an evil courſe.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore earneſtly beg of him, that he would make theſe Counſels effectual, that he would <hi>grant us repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto life,</hi> that he would make us all ſenſible of our faults, ſorry for them, and reſolved to amend them; and let us every one put up <hi>David</hi>'s prayer to God for our ſelves, <hi>Deal with thy Servant according to thy mercy, and teach me thy ſtatutes; order my ſteps in thy word, and let not any iniquity have dominion over me; teach me, O Lord, the way of thy ſtatutes, that I may keep them unto the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now done; I am only to mind you of another Duty, which is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company our Repentance, and Faſting, and Prayer, as a Teſtimony of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our Repentance, and one of the beſt means to make our Faſting and Prayer acceptable to God, and to turn away his Judgments from us, and that is Charity and Alms to the Poor, whoſe number is very great among us,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43767:37"/>
and their neceſſities very preſſing and clamorous, and therefore do call for a bountiful Supply.</p>
            <p>And to convince men of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of this Duty, and the Efficacy of it in Conjunction with our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Faſting, and Prayers, I ſhall only offer to your conſideration a few plain Texts of Scripture, which need no comment upon them. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27. it is the Prophets advice to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar; Break off thy ſins by righteouſneſs, and thine iniquity, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy to the poor; if ſo be it may be a lengthning of thy tranquillity.</hi> Acts 10.4. the Angel there tells <hi>Cornelius, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.</hi> Iſa. 58.5. <hi>Is not this the faſt which I have choſen, to looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to undo the heavy burthens, and to let the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are caſt out, to thy houſe; when thou ſeeſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thine own fleſh? Then ſhall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health ſhall ſpring
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43767:37"/>
forth ſpeedily, and thy righteouſneſs ſhall go before thee, and the Glory of the Lord ſhall be thy rereward; then ſhalt thou call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer thee, thou ſhalt cry, and he ſhall ſay here I am.</hi> To which I will only add that Gracious promiſe of our Saviour; <hi>Bleſſed are the merciful; for they ſhall find mercy</hi>; and that terrible ſentence in St. <hi>James, He ſhall have Judgment without mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy.</hi>

            <p n="1">I. Confeſſion of Sin; <hi>I will declare mine iniquity,</hi> or as it is in the Old Tranſlation, <hi>I will Confeſs my wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Of which I ſhall ſpeak under theſe <hi>three</hi> Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What Confeſſion of Sin is.</p>
            <p n="2">II. How far 'tis neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="3">III. What are the Reaſons and grounds of this neceſſity.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What Confeſſion of Sin is. It is a Declaration or Acknowledgment of ſome moral evil or fault to another, which we are conſcious to our ſelves we have been Guilty of. And this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment may be made by us, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God or Man. The Scripture mentions both. Confeſſion of our Sins to God is very frequently mentioned in Scripture, as the firſt and neceſſary part of Repentance; and ſometimes,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43767:39"/>
and in ſome caſes Confeſſion to men is not only recommended, but enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. How far Confeſſion of our Sins is Neceſſary. That it is neceſſary to confeſs our Sins to God, the Scripture plainly declares, and is I think a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of all diſpute. For it is a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary part of Repentance, that we ſhould confeſs our Sins to God, with a due ſenſe of the evil of them; and therefore the Scripture maketh this a Neceſſary qualification, and Condition of Pardon and Forgiveneſs. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins ſhall have mercy.</hi> 1 John 1.9. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs</hi>; implying that if we do not confeſs our ſins to God, the guilt of them will ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; to <hi>God</hi> I ſay, for of Confeſſion to him St. <hi>John</hi> plainly ſpeaks, when he ſays, <hi>He is faithful and juſt</hi>; Who? <hi>God</hi> ſurely; who tho' he be not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before, yet is neceſſarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the words before; <hi>If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our ſins,</hi> i. e. to God, <hi>he is faithful and juſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:43767:40"/>A general Confeſſion of our ſins is abſolutely neceſſary; and in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a particular acknowledgment of them, and repentance for them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the ſins have been great and deliberate and preſumptuous; in this Caſe a particular Confeſſion of them, and Repentance for them, is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo far as we can particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect them, and call them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance: Whereas for ſins of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and infirmity, of ſurprize and daily incurſion, for leſſer Omiſſions, and the Defects and Imperfections of our beſt Actions and Services, we have all the Reaſon that can be to believe, that God will accept of a general Confeſſion of them, and Repentance for them. And if any Man ask me, where I find this diſtinction in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, between a general and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Repentance? I anſwer, that it is not neceſſary it ſhould be any where expreſt in Scripture, being ſo clearly founded in the Nature and Reaſon of the thing; becauſe in many caſes it is not poſſible that we ſhould have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Knowledge and Remembrance of all our particular Sins; as is plain in Sins of ignorance, ſince our very
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43767:40"/>
calling them by that Name, does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſuppoſe that we do not know them. It is impoſſible we ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thoſe Sins afterwards, which we did not know when they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: And therefore either a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Repentance for theſe and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sins I mentioned of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, muſt be ſufficient in order to the Pardon of them; or we muſt ſay, that they are unpardonable, which would be very unreaſonable, becauſe this would be to make leſſer Sins more unpardonable, than thoſe which are far greater.</p>
            <p>And yet tho' this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a general and particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be no where expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in Scripture, there does not want foundation for it there. Pſal. 19.12. <hi>Who can underſtand his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours? Cleanſe thou me from ſecret Sins.</hi> (i. e.) Such as we do not diſcern and take notice of, when they are committed: And yet <hi>David</hi> ſuppoſeth, that upon a general Acknowledgment of them, and Repentance for them, we may be cleanſed from them; tho' we cannot make a particular Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43767:41"/>
of them, and exerciſe a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Repentance for them, becauſe they are <hi>ſecret,</hi> and we do not particularly underſtand what they are.</p>
            <p>As for our confeſſing our Sins to Men, both Scripture and Reaſon do in ſome caſes recommend and enjoyn it. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In order to the obtaining of the Prayers of good men for us. <hi>James</hi> 5.16. <hi>Confeſs your Sins one to another</hi>; he ſaid before, <hi>The prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up.</hi> This in all probability is meant of the Miraculous Power of Prayer, which St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> reckons among the Miraculous Gifts of the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon Chriſtians in the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Church, and this is very much countenanc'd and confirm'd by what preſently follows after this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Confeſſing our Sins one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and praying one for another,</hi> and given as the Reaſon of it; <hi>for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual fervent prayer of a righteous Man availeth much</hi>; the Original is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the inſpir'd prayer,</hi> which in the verſe before, is call'd <hi>the prayer of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43767:41"/>
faith,</hi> meaning that Miraculous Faith, in the Power whereof Chriſtians did obtain of God whatever they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd to ask of him; according to our Saviour's promiſe in the Goſpel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the efficacy of the Prayers of Chriſtians, which we find mention'd among the other Miraculous Powers, which were to be conferr'd upon them by the coming of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Confeſſion of our Sins to Men is likewiſe reaſonable, in order to the eaſe and ſatisfaction of our minds, and our being directed in our Duty for the future. In this Caſe common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Prudence, without any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Scripture, will direct men to have recourſe to this remedy, <hi>viz.</hi> to diſcover and lay open our diſeaſe to ſome skilful ſpiritual Phyſician, to ſome faithful Friend or prudent Guide, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſpiritual advice and direction, for the peace and ſatisfaction of our minds. And then,</p>
            <p n="3">3. In caſe our Sins have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and ſcandalous, both Reaſon and the practice of the Chriſtian Church
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43767:42"/>
do require, that when men have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly offended, they ſhould give pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Satisfaction, and open Teſtimony of their Repentance.</p>
            <p>But as for private and <hi>auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of our Sins to a Prieſt in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and as of abſolute neceſſity to our obtaining Pardon and Forgiveneſs from God, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, this is neither neceſſary by divine Precept, nor by any Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Practice of the ancient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, as I have ſhewn in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Not to mention the bad conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Practice, and the impious and dangerous uſe which hath been made of this Seal of Confeſſion, for the concealing and carrying on of the moſt wicked and barbarous deſigns; and the debauching of the Penitents, by drawing them into the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame and greater Sins, than thoſe which they confeſſed; which the more devout Perſons of that Church have frequently complain'd of. I proceed now to ſhew briefly in the</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:43767:42"/>III. Place, the Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the neceſſity of confeſſing our Sins to God; and I ſhall but juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Precept and Command of God; for which I have already produced clear Proof of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the Nature of the thing, becauſe without this there can be no Repentance towards God. He that will not ſo much as own the faults which he hath been guilty of, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Repent of them. If we will not confeſs our Sins to God, we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver like to be ſorry for them. Thus much for the <hi>firſt</hi> thing in the Text, the Confeſſion of our Sins. I proceed now to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Ingredient of Repentance mentioned in the Text, which is Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for Sin; <hi>I will declare mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and be ſorry for my Sin.</hi> In the handling of this Argument, I ſhall</p>
            <p n="1">I. Conſider the Nature of this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sorrow.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:43767:43"/>II. The Reaſon and Grounds of our Sorrow for Sin.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Meaſure and Degrees of it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. How far the outward expreſſion of our inward grief by Tears is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to a true Repentance.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For the Nature of this Paſſion. Sorrow is a trouble or diſturbance of Mind, occaſioned by ſomething that is evil, done or ſuffer'd by us, or which we are in danger of ſuffering, that tends greatly to our damage or miſchief: So that to be ſorry for a thing, is nothing elſe but to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly affected with the Conſideration of the evil of it, and of the miſchief and inconvenience which is like to redound to us from it: Which if it be a Moral evil, ſuch as Sin is, to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for it, is to be troubled that we have done it, and to wiſh with all our hearts that we had been wiſer, and had done otherwiſe; and if this Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be true and real, if it abide and ſtay upon us, it will produce a firm
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43767:43"/>
Purpoſe and Reſolution in us, not to do the like for the future.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, that we are ſaid to be ſorry for the death and loſs of Friends; but this is rather the effect of Natural Affection than of our Reaſon, which always endeavours to check and moderate our grief for that which we cannot help, and labours by all means to turn our Sorrow into patience: And we are ſaid likewiſe to grieve for the miſeries and ſufferings of others; but this is not ſo properly Sorrow, as Pity and Compaſſion. Sorrow rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects our ſelves, and our own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Sufferings. I proceed in the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Place To enquire into the Reaſons and Grounds of our Sorrow for Sin; and they, as I have already hinted, are theſe <hi>two</hi>; the Intrinſecal, or the Conſequent evil of Sin; either the evil of Sin in it's ſelf, or the miſchiefs or inconveniencies which it will bring upon us. For every one that is ſorry for any fault he is guilty of, he is ſo upon one of theſe <hi>two</hi> accounts; either upon the ſcore of ingenuity, or of intereſt; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath done a thing which is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43767:44"/>
unworthy in it's ſelf, or becauſe he hath done ſomething which may prove prejudicial to himſelf; either out of a principle of love and gratitude to God, or from a principle of ſelf-love. And tho' the former of theſe be the better, the more generous principle of Sorrow; yet the latter is uſually the firſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the more ſenſible, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us more nearly: For Sin is a baſe and ill-natur'd thing, and renders a Man not ſo apt to be affected with the injuries he hath offer'd to God, as with the Miſchief which is likely to fall upon himſelf. And therefore I will begin with the latter, becauſe it is uſually the more ſenſible cauſe of our Trouble and Sorrow for Sin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The great Miſchief and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that Sin is like to bring upon us. When a Man is thoroughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the danger into which his ſins have brought him, that they have <hi>made him a child of wrath,</hi> and <hi>a Son of perdition,</hi> that he is thereby fallen under the heavy dipleaſure of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, and liable to all thoſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful curſes, which are written in his Book, that ruin and deſtruction hang
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43767:44"/>
over him, and that nothing keeps him from eternal and intolerable torments, but the Patience and Long-ſuffering of God, which he does not know how ſoon it may ceaſe to interpoſe between him and the wrath of God, and let him fall into that endleſs and inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſery, which is the juſt portion and deſert of his Sins; he that lays to Heart the ſad Eſtate and Condition, into which he hath brought himſelf by Sin, and the Miſchiefs which attend him every moment of his continuance in that ſtate, and how near they are to him, and that there is but a ſtep between him and Death, and hardly another between that and Hell, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſurely but be very ſorry for what he hath done, and be highly diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and offended with himſelf, that he ſhould be the Author of his own ruin, and have contributed as much as in him lies to his everlaſting undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another and better Principle of Sorrow for Sin, is ingenuity; becauſe we are ſenſible, that we have carried our ſelves very unworthily towards God, and have been injurious to him,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43767:45"/>
who hath laid all poſſible obligations upon us: For he hath made us, and hath given us our beings, and hath charged his watchful Providence with the continual care of us; his bounty hath miniſtred to the neceſſities and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of our Life; all the Bleſſings that we enjoy, are the Effects of his meer love and goodneſs, without any hope of requital, or expectation of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther return from us, than of love, of gratitude, and obedience; which yet are of no advantage to him, but very beneficial and comfortable to our ſelves: For he does not expect Duty and Obedience from us, with any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Benefit to himſelf, but for our ſakes, and in order to our own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Nay, his kindneſs did not ſtop here, but after we had abuſed him by our repeated provocations, yet he ſtill continued his care of us; and when we had farther provoked him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Love, and to call in his abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Goodneſs, and had done what lay in us to make our ſelves miſerable, he would not ſuffer us to be undone, but found out a Ranſom for us, and hath
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43767:45"/>
contrived a way for the pardon of all our offences, and to reconcile us to himſelf, and to reſtore us to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, by the moſt ſtupendous and amazing condeſcenſion of love and goodneſs that ever was, even by giving his only Son to dye for us.</p>
            <p>And can we reflect upon all this, and not be ſorry and grieved at our very hearts, that we ſhould be ſo evil to him, who hath been ſo good to us, that we ſhould be ſo undutiful to ſo loving a Father, ſo unkind to ſo faithful and conſtant a Friend, ſo ungrateful and unworthy to ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a Benefactor? If any thing will melt us into Tears, ſurely this will do it, to conſider that we have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, who made us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually preſerves us, and after all our unkindneſs to him, did ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo great a love for us, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from Hell and Deſtruction, by the Death and Suffering of his Son, and notwithſtanding all our offences does ſtill offer us Pardon and Peace, Life and Happineſs. Such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations as theſe, ſeriouſly laid to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43767:46"/>
heart, ſhould, one would think break the hardeſt heart, and make Tears to guſh, even out of a Rock. I proceed in the</p>
            <p n="3">III. Place to conſider the Meaſure and Degree of our Sorrow for Sin. That it admits of degrees, which ought to bear ſome proportion to the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of our Sins, and the ſeveral aggravations of them, and the time of our continuance in them, is out of all diſpute: For tho' the leaſt Sin be a juſt cauſe of the deepeſt Sorrow; yet becauſe our greateſt grief can never bear a due proportion to the vaſt and infinite evil of Sin, God is pleaſed to require and accept ſuch meaſures of Sorrow, as do not bear an exact cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence to the Malignity of Sin, provided they be according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of our Nature, and in ſome ſort proportioned to the degree and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of our Sins; <hi>i. e.</hi> Tho' the higheſt degree of our Sorrow doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fall below the evil of the leaſt Sin; yet God requires that we ſhould be more deeply affected with ſome Sins, than others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:43767:46"/>But what is the loweſt degree which God requires in a true Penitent, and will accept, as it is impoſſible for me to tell, ſo it is unprofitable for any body to know: For no Man can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably make this enquiry with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign, than that he may learn how he may come off with God upon the cheapeſt and eaſieſt terms. Now there cannot be a worſe ſign, that a Man is not truly ſenſible of the great evil of Sin, than this, that he deſires to be troubled for it, as little as may be, and no longer than needs muſt: And none ſurely are more unlikely to find acceptance with God, than thoſe who deal ſo nearly, and endeavour to drive ſo hard a bargain with him.</p>
            <p>And therefore I ſhall only ſay this in general, concerning the degrees of our Sorrow for Sin; that Sin being ſo great an evil in it ſelf, and of ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious a conſequence to us, it cannot be too much lamented and grieved for by us: And the more and greater our Sins have been, and the longer we have continued and lived in them, they call for ſo much the greater Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43767:47"/>
and deeper humiliation from us: For the reaſoning of our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Mary Magdalene, She loved much, becauſe much was forgiven her,</hi> is proportionably true in this caſe, thoſe who have ſinned much, ſhould ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the more.</p>
            <p>And then we muſt take this Caution along with us, that if we would Judge aright of the truth of our Sorrow for Sin, we muſt not meaſure it ſo much by the Degrees of ſenſible trouble and affliction, as by the rational Effects of it, which are hatred of Sin, and a fixt purpoſe and reſolution againſt it for the future: for he is moſt truly ſorry for his Miſcarriage, who looks upon what he hath done amiſs, with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence and deteſtation of the thing, and wiſheth he had not done it, and cenſures himſelf ſeverely for it, and thereupon reſolves not to do the like again. And this is the Character which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of a Godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. that <hi>it worketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it produceth <hi>a real change in our minds,</hi> and makes us to alter our purpoſe and reſolution: And tho' ſuch a Perſon may not be ſo paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43767:47"/>
and ſenſibly afflicted for Sin, yet it appears by the Effect, that he hath a deeper and more rational re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of the evil of it, than that man who is ſad and melancholy and drooping for never ſo long a time, and after all returns to his former ſinful courſe; the Degree of his Sorrow may appear greater, but the Effect of it is really leſs.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. As for the outward expreſſions of our Grief and Sorrow. The uſual ſign and outward expreſſion of Sorrow is Tears; but theſe being not the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our Duty, but an external Teſtimony of it, which ſome tempers are more unapt to, than others; we are much leſs to Judge of the Truth of our Sorrow for Sin by theſe, than by our inward ſenſible Trouble and Affliction of Spirit. Some Perſons are of a more tender and melting diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and can command their Tears upon a little occaſion, and upon very ſhort warning; and ſuch Perſons that can weep for every thing elſe that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them, have much more reaſon to ſuſpect the Truth of their Sorrow for Sin, if this outward expreſſion of it
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43767:48"/>
be wanting. And we find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Sorrow of true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents does very frequently diſcover it ſelf by this outward ſign of it. Thus when <hi>Ezra</hi> and the people made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Sins to God, it is ſaid, that <hi>they wept very Sore, Ezra</hi> 10. <hi>Peter</hi> when he reflected upon that great Sin of denying his Maſter, 'tis ſaid, <hi>He went forth and wept bitterly. David</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was abundant in this expreſſion of his grief. In the Book of Pſalms he ſpeaks frequently of his <hi>ſighs,</hi> and <hi>groans,</hi> and of <hi>watering his couch with his tears</hi>: yea ſo ſenſibly was he affected with the Evil of Sin, that he could ſhed tears plentifully for the Sins of others, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.136. <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, becauſe men keep not thy law.</hi> In like manner <hi>Jeremiah</hi> tells us, that <hi>his Soul did weep in ſecret places, for the pride and obſtinacy of the Jews</hi>; that <hi>his eye did weep ſore, and run down with tears; Jer.</hi> 13.17. And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Philip 3.18, 19. <hi>There are many that walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> And there ſeems to be this natural Reaſon for it, that all great and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43767:48"/>
impreſſions upon the Mind, all deep inward reſentments have uſually a proportionable effect upon the Body, and t<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> inferiour Faculties.</p>
            <p>But tho' this happen very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet it is not ſo conſtant and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: For all men have not the ſame tenderneſs of Spirit, nor are equally prone to tears; nay, tho' a Man can weep upon natural accounts, as upon the loſs of a Child or near Relation, or an intimate Friend, or when he lyes under a ſharp Bodily pain, yet a Man may truly repent, tho' he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Sorrow for Sin the ſame way, provided he give Teſtimony of it by more real Effects: And therefore the Rule, which is commonly given by Caſuiſts in this caſe, ſeems to be more enſnaring, than true and uſeful;
Namely, <q>that that man that can ſhed Tears upon account of any evil leſs than that of Sin, (as certainly all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural evils are) ought to queſtion the Truth of his Repentance for any Sin that he hath committed, if he cannot ſhed Tears for it.</q>
This I think is not true, becauſe there is ſcarce any Man, of ſo hard and unrelenting a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43767:49"/>
Spirit, but the loſs of a kind Father, or a dear Child, or other near Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will force Tears, from him And yet ſuch a Man, if it were to <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave his Soul, may not be able at ſome times to ſhed a Tear for his Sins. And the Reaſon is obvious; becauſe Tears do proceed from a ſenſitive trouble, and are commonly the Product of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection; and therefore 'tis no wonder, if they flow more readily and eaſily upon a natural account; becauſe they are the Effect of a Cauſe ſuitable to their Nature. But Sorrow for Sin, which hath more of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Underſtanding in it, hath not it's Foundation in natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in Reaſon; and therefore may not many times expreſs it ſelf in Tears, tho' it may produce greater and more proper Effects.</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole matter, I ſee no Reaſon to call in queſtion the Truth and Sincerity of that Man's Sorrow and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, who hates Sin and forſakes it, and returns to God and his Duty, tho' he cannot ſhed Tears, and expreſs the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Soul for his Sin, by the ſame ſignifications that a Mother doth in the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43767:49"/>
loſs of her only Son. He that cannot weep like a Child, may reſolve like a Man, and that undoubtedly will find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God. A learned Divine hath well illuſtrated this Matter by this Similitude. Two Perſons walking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether eſpie a Serpent, the one ſhrieks and cries out at the ſight of it, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kills it: So is it in Sorrow for Sin; ſome expreſs it by great Lamentation and Tears, and vehement tranſports of paſſion; others by greater and more real effects of hatred and deteſtation, by forſaking their Sins, and by morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and ſubduing their Luſts: But he that kills it does certainly beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his inward diſpleaſure and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt it.</p>
            <p>The Application I ſhall make of what hath been ſaid upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall be in <hi>two</hi> particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">I. By way of Caution, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a double miſtake about Sorrow for Sin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some look upon Trouble and Sorrow for Sin, as the whole of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:43767:50"/>2. Others exact from themſelves ſuch a degree of Sorrow, as ends in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and renders them unfit both for the Duties of Religion, and of their particular Calling. The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns almoſt the generality of men; the latter but a very few in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are a great many, who look upon Trouble and Sorrow for their Sins, as the whole of Repentance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is but an Introduction to it. It is that which <hi>works repentance</hi>; but is not Repentance it ſelf. Repentance is always accompanied with Sorrow for Sin; but Sorrow for Sin does not always end in true Repentance: Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row only reſpects Sins paſt; but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is chiefly preventive of Sin for the future. And God doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore require our Sorrow for Sin, in order to our forſaking of it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. Repentance is there call'd <hi>repentance from dead Works.</hi> It is not only a Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for them, but a turning from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:43767:50"/>There is no Reaſon why men ſhould be ſo willing to deceive themſelves, for they are like to be the loſers by it: But ſo we ſee it is, that many men are contented to be deceived to their own ruin; and among many other ways, which men have to cheat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, this is none of the leaſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, to think that if they can but ſhed a few Tears for Sin upon a death-bed, which no doubt they may eaſily do, when they ſee their Friends weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about them, and apprehend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be in imminent danger, not only of Death, but of that which is more terrible, the heavy diſpleaſure, and the fiery Indignation of Almighty God, <hi>into whoſe hands it is a fearful thing to fall</hi>; I ſay, they think that if they can but do thus much, God will accept this for a true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and hereupon grant them Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and eternal life. And upon theſe fond hopes, they adjourn their Repentance, and the Reformation of their lives to a dying hour.</p>
            <p>Indeed if I were to ſpeak to a Man upon his Death-bed, I would encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43767:51"/>
him to a great Contrition and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for his Sins, as his laſt and only remedy, and the beſt thing he can do at that time; but on the other hand, when I am ſpeaking to thoſe that are well and in health, I dare not give them the leaſt Encouragement to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their Souls upon this, becauſe it is an hazardous and almoſt deſperate remedy; eſpecially when men have cunningly and deſignedly contriv'd to rob God of the Service of their lives, and to put him off with a few unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Sighs and Tears at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of the World. Our Saviour tells us, that it is <hi>not every one, that ſhall ſay unto him Lord! Lord! that ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>; and that there is a time, when <hi>many ſhall ſeek to enter in, but ſhall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Summ of this Caution is, that men ſhould take heed of miſtaking Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for Sin, for true Repentance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be followed with the forſaking of Sin and the real Reformation of our Lives. <hi>Ahab</hi> humbled himſelf, but we do not find that he was a true Penitent. <hi>Judas</hi> was ſorry for his Sin,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43767:51"/>
and yet for all that was <hi>the Son of perdition. Eſau</hi> is a ſad type of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual Sorrow for Sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. where the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>He found no place for Repentance,</hi> that is no way to change the mind of his Father <hi>Iſaac, tho' he ſought it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with tears.</hi> If Sorrow for Sin were Repentance, there would be ſtore of Penitents in Hell; for there is the deepeſt and moſt intenſe ſorrow, <hi>weeping and wailing and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Another miſtake which Men ought to be caution'd againſt in this Matter, is of thoſe who exact from themſelves ſuch a degree of Sorrow for Sin, as ends in deep melancholy, as renders them unfit both for the Duties of Religion, and of their particular Callings. But becauſe there are but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few who fall into this miſtake, I ſhall need to ſay the leſs to it. This only I ſhall ſay, that thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their ſorrow to ſuch a degree, as to drown their Spirits, and to ſink them into melancholy and mopiſhneſs, and thereby render themſelves unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43767:52"/>
to God, and unfit for the neceſſities of this life, they commit one Sin more to mourn for, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the End of Repentance by the indiſcreet uſe of the Means of it. For the End of Sorrow for Sin, is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of it, and returning to our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But he that Sorrows for Sin, ſo as to unfit him for his Duty, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats his own deſign, and deſtroys the end he aims at.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Other part of the Aplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Diſcourſe ſhould be, to ſtir up this affection of Sorrow in us. And here, if I had time, I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to you the great evil of ſin, and the infinite Danger and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of it. If the holy men in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> were ſo deeply affected with the ſins of others, as to ſhed <hi>rivers of tears</hi> at the remembrance of them; how ought we to be touched with the ſenſe of our own ſins, who are equally concerned in the diſhonour brought to God by them, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more in the danger they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to! Can we weep for our
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43767:52"/>
dead Friends? and have we no ſenſe of that heavy load of Guilt, of that <hi>body of death,</hi> which we carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with us? Can we be ſad and melancholy for temporal Loſſes and Sufferings, and <hi>refuſe to be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> And is it no Trouble to us to have loſt Heaven and Happineſs, and to be in continual danger of the intolerable Sufferings, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Torments of another World?</p>
            <p>I ſhall only offer to your Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, the great Benefit and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which will redound to us from this <hi>godly Sorrow; it worketh Repentance to Salvation, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> If we would thus <hi>ſow in Tears,</hi> we ſhould <hi>reap in Joy.</hi> This <hi>Sorrow</hi> would but <hi>continue for a time,</hi> and <hi>in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the Reſurrection there would be <hi>Joy</hi> to all Eternity, <hi>Joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and full of Glory.</hi> It is but a very little while, and theſe <hi>days of Mourning will be accompliſh'd</hi>; and then <hi>all Tears ſhall be wiped from our Eyes; and the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall come to Sion, with Songs, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43767:53"/>
everlaſting Joy ſhall be upon their Heads. They ſhall obtain Joy and Gladneſs, and Sorrow and Sighing ſhall flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted: but wo unto you that laugh, for ye ſhall mourn and weep.</hi> If Men will rejoice in the pleaſures of Sin, and <hi>walk in the ways of their hearts, and in the ſight of their eyes</hi>; if they will <hi>remove Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from their heart,</hi> and put away all ſad and melancholy Thoughts from them, and are reſolved to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their Spirits againſt the ſenſe of Sin, againſt the Checks and Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of their own Conſciences, and the Suggeſtions of God's Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, againſt all the Arguments that God can offer, and all the Methods that God can uſe to bring them to Repentance; let them <hi>know, that for all theſe things God will bring them into judgment</hi>; and becauſe they would not give way to a timely and a ſeaſonable Sorrow for Sin, they ſhall <hi>lye down</hi> in eternal <hi>Sorrow, weeping and wailing and gnaſhing of teeth ſhall be their portion for ever.</hi> From which ſad and miſerable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,

            <p>THE great Folly and Perverſeneſs of humane Nature is in nothing more apparent, than in this, that when in all other things Men are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

            <p n="2">II. A true Contrition for our Sin, not only for fear of the pernicious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of Sin, and the Puniſhment that will follow it, implyed in theſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43767:56"/>
Words, <hi>and it profited me not,</hi> this is but a very imperfect Contrition: but from a juſt ſenſe of the evil nature of Sin, and the Fault and Offence of it againſt God, that we have done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Right and our Duty. <hi>If any ſay, I have ſinned, and perverted that which was right.</hi> Here you ſee that true and perfect Contrition for our Sins, is made a neceſſary Condition of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Benefit here promiſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Deliverance from the Puniſhment due to them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Here is a deſcription of the evil nature of Sin, it is <hi>a perverting of that which is right.</hi> Sin is a perverting of the Conſtitution and Appointment of God, and of the Nature and Order of Things. God hath given Man a Law and Rule to walk by, but <hi>the fooliſhneſs of man perverteth his way.</hi> The great Lines of our Duty are plain and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all Men, and if we would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the direction of our own Minds, concerning Good and Evil, every Man would be <hi>a law to himſelf. He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good.</hi> That which is right and juſt and good, is plain and obvious, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43767:56"/>
offers it ſelf firſt to us, and when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we ſin, we go out of the right way that lies plain before us, and <hi>turn aſide into crooked paths.</hi> But when we do that which is right, we act agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Deſign and Frame of our Beings, and comply with the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Order of Things; we do what becomes us, and are what we ought to be: but ſin perverts the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things, and puts them out of courſe, <hi>I have ſinned and perverted that which was right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. You have here an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Miſchievous and Pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequences of Sin; <hi>I have ſinned and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not.</hi> Which laſt words are a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in which much leſs is ſaid than is meant and intended; <hi>it profited me not,</hi> that is, it was ſo far from being of advantage, that the Effects and Conſequences of it were very Pernicious and Deſtructive.</p>
            <p>And this is not only true as to the final iſſue, and event of an Evil courſe in the other World; but I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhew, that even in reſpect
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43767:57"/>
of this World, and the preſent Life, the Practice of ſome ſins is plainly Miſchievous to the temporal Intereſts of men; that others are wholly unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; and that thoſe which pretend to bring ſome benefit and advantage will, when all accounts are caſt up, and all circumſtances duly weighed and conſidered, be found to do far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall ſhew, that the Practice of ſome Vices is Evidently Miſchievous and Prejudicial to us, as to this World; as all thoſe Vices which fall under the cognizance of Human Laws, and are puniſhed by them; Murther, Theft, Perjury, Sedition, Rebellion and the like; theſe cannot be denyed to be of pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to men, and therefore the great Patrons of Vice ſeldom plead for theſe, the inconvenience of them is ſo palpable, that ſome feel it, and all may ſee it every day.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe, there are many other ſorts of ſin, which human Laws either take no notice of, or do not ſo ſeverely Puniſh, which yet in their
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43767:57"/>
Natural Conſequences, are very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to our preſent intereſt; either they are a diſturbance to our minds, or dangerous to our health, or rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to our Eſtate, or hurtful to our Reputation, or it may be at once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to us, in all, or moſt of theſe reſpects; and theſe are the greateſt temporal inconveniences that men are liable to.</p>
            <p>All irregular Paſſions, as Wrath, Malice, Envy, Impatience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, are not only a diſturbance to our ſelves, but they naturally draw upon us hatred and contempt from others. Any one of theſe paſſions is enough to render a Man uneaſie to himſelf, and to make his Converſation diſguſtful and troubleſome to all that are about him; for all men naturally hate all thoſe, who are of an envious, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, or revengeful temper, and are apt to riſe up and ſtand upon their guard againſt them. Anger and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience are great deformities of the mind, and make a Man look as ugly, as if he had a wry and diſtorted Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; and theſe paſſions are apt to breed in others a ſecret contempt of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43767:58"/>
us, and to bring our prudence into queſtion, becauſe they are ſigns of a weak and impotent mind, that either hath loſt, or never had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>There are other Vices, which are plainly pernicious to our health, and do naturally bring Pains and Diſeaſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men; ſuch are Intemperance and Luſt; and tho' ſome may pretend to govern themſelves, in the Practice of theſe, with ſo much moderation and diſcretion, as to prevent the notorious bad conſequences of them, yet there are very few or none that do ſo; this is ſeldom more than a Speculation, and men that allow themſelves in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lewd or intemperate courſe, will find it very hard to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in it; for after men have forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their innocence, and broke in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their natural Modeſty, they are apt by degrees to grow profligate and deſperate; if a Man gives way but a little to his own vicious inclinations, they will ſoon get head of him, and no Man knows how far they will hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him at laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:43767:58"/>Beſides that the Vices I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, Intemperance and Luſt, have other great inconveniences attending them, they expoſe men more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than moſt other Vices, to occaſions of quarrel, in which men often loſe their own lives, or take away other mens, by which they fall under the danger of the Law, and the ſtroke of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Juſtice; or if they eſcape that, (as too often they do) they cannot fly from their own Conſciences, which do commonly fill them with the horror and torment of ſuch an action all their days; ſo pernicious are the uſual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of theſe Vices, of which we ſee ſad inſtances every day.</p>
            <p>Nor are theſe Vices leſs hurtful to mens Eſtates; for they are extreamly expenſive and waſteful, and uſually make men careleſs of all their buſineſs and concernments, liable to be cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe, whom they are forced to truſt with their affairs, becauſe they will not mind them themſelves, and to be abuſed by crafty men, who watch the oportunities of their folly and weakneſs, to draw them into
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43767:59"/>
fooliſh bargains. It is an old Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that more men periſh by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, than by the Sword; and I believe it is as true, that more E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates ſtates are diſſipated and waſted by theſe two riotous Vices, than by all other Accidents whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And there is ſcarce any notorious Vice, by which men do not greatly ſuffer in their Reputation and good Name, even when the times are worſt and moſt degenerate; any wicked courſe, whether of debauchery or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, is a blemiſh to a Man's credit, not only in the eſteem of the Sober and Virtuous, but even of thoſe who are looſe and extravagant; for men are ſooner brought to Practiſe what is bad, than to approve of it, and do generally think all ſin and wickedneſs to be a ſtain upon them, whatever in a ſwaggering humor they may ſay to the contrary. A clear evidence of this is, that men do ſo ſtudiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to conceal their Vices, and are ſo careful that as few as may be ſhould be conſcious to them, and are ſo confounded if they be diſcovered, and ſo out of all patience when they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43767:59"/>
are upbraided with them, a plain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, that theſe things are ſhameful in themſelves, and whatever face men may put upon things, that they do inwardly and at the bottom of their Hearts believe, that theſe Practices are deſervedly of bad Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and do, in the general opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mankind, leave a blot upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are other ſins, which tho' they are not uſually attended with Conſequences ſo palpably miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, yet are plainly unprofitable, and bring no manner of advantage to men.</p>
            <p>Of this ſort is all kind of Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and cuſtomary Swearing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Converſation, there is neither profit nor pleaſure in them. What doth the Profane Man get by his contempt of Religion? He is neither more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, nor better truſted for this quality; but on the contrary, it is many times really to his prejudice, and brings a great odium upon him, not only from thoſe who ſincerely love Religion, but from others alſo;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43767:60"/>
tho' they are conſcious to themſelves, that they do not love Religion as they ought, yet they have a Veneration for it, and cannot endure that any one ſhould ſpeak ſlightly of it.</p>
            <p>And 'tis as hard to imagine, where the pleaſure of Profaneneſs lies. Men cannot but at firſt have a great reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in their minds againſt it, and muſt offer conſiderable violence to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to bring themſelves to it; and when it is grown more familiar, and their Conſciences are become more ſear'd and inſenſible, yet whenever they are alone and ſerious, or when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny affliction or calamity is upon them, they are full of fears and anguiſh, their guilt ſtares them in the face, and their Conſciences are raging and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>And as all kind of Profaneneſs is unprofitable, ſo more eſpecially cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary ſwearing in ordinary Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon every occaſion of paſſion, or any other trivial cauſe, nay it may be without cauſe, out of mere habit and cuſtom. Now what can poſſibly be imagined to be the profit or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43767:60"/>
of this Vice! Senſual pleaſure in it there can be none, becauſe it is not founded in the temper of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; a Man may be naturally prone to Anger or Luſt; but no Man I think is born with a ſwearing Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>And there is as little Profit as Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it; for the common and trivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al uſe of Oaths makes them perfectly inſignificant to their end, and is ſo far from giving credit to a Man's word, that it rather weakens the Reputation of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thoſe Vices which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be of Advantage to us, when all accounts are caſt up, and all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances duly conſider'd, will be found to be quite otherwiſe. Some Vices pretend to bring in profit; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to yield pleaſure, but upon a thorow examination of the matter, theſe pretences will vaniſh and come to nothing.</p>
            <p>The Vices which pretend to be moſt profitable are Covetouſneſs and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Fraud and Falſhood, and Perfidiouſneſs: but if we look well
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43767:61"/>
into them, we ſhall find, that either they do not bring the Advantages they pretended to bring; or that the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which attend them are as great or greater, than the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they bring; or elſe that the Practice of the oppoſite Virtues would be of much greater Advantage to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some of theſe Vices do not bring the Advantages they pretend to do. Covetouſneſs may increaſe a Man's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, but it adds nothing to his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Contentment; for tho' his Eſtate grow never ſo much, his want is ſtill as great as it was before, and his care and trouble continually grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo that ſo long as he continues Covetous, the more Rich, the leſs Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>
            <p>And then for Fraud and Falſhood; they are not of that real and laſting Advantage, that cunning but ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted men are apt to imagine. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is truer than <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Solomon, The lying tongue is but for a moment.</hi> A Man can Practice the Arts of Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Deceit but for a little while,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43767:61"/>
before they will be diſcovered, and when they are diſcovered, they are ſo far from being any Advantage to him, that they turn to his prejudice, and the cunning Man begins to be in a bad caſe, and he that was wont to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach others, is at laſt caught him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Several of theſe Vices are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with inconveniences, as great or greater than the Advantages they bring. If a Man increaſe his Eſtate by Injuſtice and Oppreſſion, yet he loſeth his Reputation. Beſides, that all fraudulent and unjuſt courſes are apt to entangle a Man in a great many inconveniences, and to expoſe him to troubleſome ſuits, for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what he hath unjuſtly gotten; it is very often ſeen, that what is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by injuſtice is ſpent in Law, and tho' it may be thoſe whom he hath wronged never recover their right, yet firſt or laſt the unjuſt Man is put to more trouble and vexation about it, than the thing is worth. This <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> obſerves, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.16. <hi>In the revenue of the wicked there is trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:43767:62"/>The perfidious Man by betraying a Friend or a Truſt, may perhaps make ſome preſent Advantage: but then by ſuch a villany he makes himſelf odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all Mankind, and by this means, at one time or other, prevents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of greater advantages which he might have had another way, and perhaps at laſt is miſerably cruſhed by thoſe whom he betrayed, who in the change and revolution of human affairs, may ſome time or other have the oportunity of being revenged. Or elſe,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Practice of the oppoſite Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues would be of far greater Advantage to us.</p>
            <p>Truth and Fidelity are in common experience ſound to be a better and ſurer way of thriving, and more like to laſt and hold out, than Fraud and Falſhood; and as honeſty is a ſurer way of raiſing an Eſtate, ſo it brings along with it greater ſecurity of the quiet enjoyment of it; there is never any real occaſion, and ſeldom any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and pretence of bringing ſuch a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43767:62"/>
Man into trouble; for which reaſon <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Better is the little which the righteous Man hath, than great poſſeſſions without right</hi>; becauſe, tho' it be but little, yet it will wear like Steel, and he is like to enjoy it quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and may increaſe it; whereas the unjuſt Man is continually in danger of loſing what he hath gotten.</p>
            <p>And if this be the caſe, it is very plain, that thoſe Vices which pretend to bring the greateſt Advantage, are really unprofitable; and to theſe kind of Vices the Text ſeems to point more particularly, <hi>If any ſay I have ſinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But perhaps tho' there be no <hi>profit</hi> in any ſinful courſe, yet there may be ſome <hi>pleaſure</hi>; that comes next to be examined; and I doubt not to make it evident, that there is no ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſin, as can make it a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Temptation to any Man to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon it. The Vices which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to bring the greateſt pleaſure, are Lewdneſs, and Intemperance, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:43767:63"/>The <hi>two</hi> firſt of theſe are the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Pretenders to Pleaſure: but God knows, and the ſinner himſelf knows, how thin and tranſitory this pleaſure is, how much trouble attends it, and how many ſighs and groans follow it; and whatever pleaſure they may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to the ſenſe, they bring a great deal of anguiſh and perplexity to the mind; ſo that the trouble which they cauſe, does more than counter-vail the pleaſure which they bring: and they do not only diſturb the mind, but they diſeaſe the Body. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are there, who for the gratifying of an inordinate Luſt, and for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible pleaſure of a drunken fit, have endured the violent burnings of a Feaver, or elſe have conſumed the remainder of their days in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ſickneſs and pain?</p>
            <p>And the reaſon of all this is plain, becauſe all the pleaſures of ſin are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, and forced, and unnatural, and therefore not like to continue; they are founded in ſome Diſeaſe and Diſtemper of our minds, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43767:63"/>
always end in pain and ſmart.</p>
            <p>And as for Revenge; it is indeed a very eager and impatient deſire: but ſo far ſurely from being a pleaſure, that the very thoughts of it are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly troubleſome, and raiſe as great ſtorms in the mind of a Man, as any paſſion whatſoever; and I never heard of the pleaſure of being in a Storm: it is pleaſant indeed to be out of it, when others are in it. And when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge hath ſatisfied it ſelf, and laid its enemy bleeding at its foot, the Man that executed it commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents himſelf the next moment, and would give all the World to undo what he hath done; ſo that if there be any pleaſure in Revenge, it is ſo flitting and of ſo ſhort a continuance, that we know not where to fix it; for there is nothing but tumult and rage before the execution of it, and after it nothing but remorſe and horror; ſo that if it be a pleaſure, it is but of one moment's continuance, and laſts no longer than the act is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and what Man in his wits would purchaſe ſo ſhort a pleaſure at ſo
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43767:64"/>
dear a price? This is moſt certainly true, and if it were well conſidered, ſufficient to convince any reaſonable Man of the unreaſonableneſs of this paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cain</hi> is a fearful inſtance of this kind, who after he had drawn his Brother into the Field, and ſlain him there, how was he tormented with the guilt of what he had done, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to cry out, <hi>my puniſhment is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than I can bear,</hi> or (as ſome Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations render the words,) <hi>mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is greater than that it can be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,</hi> Gen. 4.13! <hi>From thy face</hi> (ſays he to God, in the anguiſh of his Soul) <hi>from thy face ſhall I be hid, and I ſhall be a fugitive and a vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond in the earth, and it ſhall come to paſs that every one that findeth me ſhall ſlay me,</hi> v. 14. <hi>Every one that findeth me,</hi> how fearful did his guilt make him! When probably there was then but one Man in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf. And I may ſay of this ſort of men, as St. <hi>Jude</hi> does of thoſe in his time, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 11. <hi>Wo unto them, for they have gone in the way of</hi> Cain,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43767:64"/>
they are guilty of his Crime, and his doom ſhall be theirs.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but take notice of a great Evil that grows daily upon us, and therefore deſerves with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſeverity to be diſcountenanced and puniſh'd, I mean that of Duels, than which what can be more unchriſtian? And what can be more unreaſonable, than for men upon deliberation, and after the heat of Paſſion is over, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to ſheath their Swords in one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers Bowels, only for a haſty word? And which is yet more unreaſonable, that becauſe two men are angry, and have quarelled with one another, and will fight it out, that therefore two more, who have no quarel, no kind of diſpleaſure againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt fight too, and kill one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if they can, for no reaſon and upon no provocation. Theſe falſe Rules of Honour will not paſs in another World, in the higheſt and greateſt Court of Honour, from whence there is no Appeal.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this whole Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with that excellent ſaying of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:43767:65"/>
reported in <hi>A. Gellius, Cogitate cum animis veſtris,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>Conſider (ſays he) with your ſelves, if ye be at any trouble and pain to do a good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the trouble will be ſoon over; but the pleaſure and comfort of what ye have done well, abides with you all your days: but if to gratifie your ſelves, you do any thing that is wicked, the pleaſure will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſh; but the guilt of it will ſtick by you for ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And is it not then much better to prevent all this trouble, by denying our ſelves theſe ſinful pleaſures, which will follow us with guilt while we live, and fill us with horror and deſpair when we come to die?</p>
            <p>I ſhall now make ſome reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what hath been delivered, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What hath been ſaid upon this Argument, ought particularly to move thoſe who have ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this preſent life, and the temporal Happineſs of it, that the Practice of all Virtues is a friend to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43767:65"/>
their temporal, as well as eternal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and all Vice is an Enemy to both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This likewiſe takes off all manner of excuſe from Sin and Vice. It pretends not to ſerve the Soul, and to profit our future happineſs in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World; and if it be an Enemy alſo to our preſent welfare in this world, what is there to be ſaid for it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> (which I deſire to inſiſt a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer upon) all the Arguments which I have uſed, to convince men of the folly of a wicked courſe, are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrong and unanſwerable Reaſons for Repentance; for when a Man is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that he hath done fooliſhly, and to his own prejudice, that <hi>he hath ſinned, and</hi> that <hi>it profited him not,</hi> what can he do leſs, than to be heartily ſorry for it, and aſhamed of it, and reſolved to do better for the future? Nothing ſurely is more reaſonable than Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and yet how hard is it to bring men to it? Either men will miſtake the Nature of it, and not do it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; or they will delay it, and not do it in time.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:43767:66"/>I. Men miſtake the Nature of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and there are <hi>two</hi> great miſtakes about it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of thoſe who make the great force and virtue of it to conſiſt, not ſo much in the Reſolution of the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as in the Abſolution of the Prieſt. And this the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in their Doctrine concerning Repentance does. For their Sacrament of Penance, (as they call it,) they make to conſiſt of two parts; the Matter of it, which conſiſts in theſe three acts of the Penitent, Confeſſion, Contrition, and Satisfaction; and the Form of it, which is the Abſolution of the Prieſt, in which they make the main virtue and force of Repentance to conſiſt, <hi>in quâ proecipuè ipſius vis ſita eſt,</hi> are the very words of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> And here is a wide difference betwixt us; for tho' the comfort of the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent may in ſome caſe conſiſt in the Abſolution of the Prieſt, yet the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Efficacy of Repentance does not at all conſiſt in it, but wholly in the Contrition and ſincere Reſolution of the Penitent, as the Scripture every
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43767:66"/>
where declares: and to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, is of dangerous Conſequence; becauſe it encourageth Men to hope for the benefit of Repentance, that is the Pardon and forgiveneſs of their ſins, without having truly repented. And indeed the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> have ſo framed their Doctrines in this point, that any one may ſee, that they did not matter how much they abated on the part of the Penitent, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Power of the Prieſt be but advanced, and kept up in its full height.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other Miſtake is of thoſe, who make Repentance to conſiſt in the bare Reſolution of Amendment, tho' it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have its effect; that is, tho' the ſinner either do not what he reſolved, or do it only for a fit, and during his preſent Trouble and Conviction.</p>
            <p>There is one caſe indeed, and but one, wherein a Reſolution not brought to effect is available, and that is, when nothing hinders the performance and execution of it, but only want of time and oportunity for it, when the Repentance is ſincere, and the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43767:67"/>
Reſolution real, but the Man is cut off between the actual Reformation which he intended, and which God, who ſees things certainly in their Cauſes, knows would have followed, if the Man had lived to give Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: but this is nothing to thoſe who have the oportunity to make good their Reſolution, and do not; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the reſolution which would have been perform'd, had there been time and oportunity, is reckoned for a true Repentance, and accepted of God as if it had been done; therefore the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution which was not brought to effect when there was time and opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for it, hath not the Nature of true Repentance, nor will it be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God.</p>
            <p>I will add but one thing more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Head, becauſe I doubt it is not always ſufficiently conſidered; and that is this, that a ſincere Reſolution of a better courſe, does imply a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the means, as well as of the end; he that is truly reſolved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any ſin, is likewiſe reſolved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the occaſions and temptations that would lead and draw him to it;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43767:67"/>
otherwiſe he hath taken up a raſh and fooliſh Reſolution, which he is not like to keep, becauſe he did not reſolve upon that which was neceſſary to the keeping of it. So he that reſolves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any part of his Duty, muſt likewiſe reſolve upon the means which are neceſſary to the diſcharge and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it; he that is reſolved to be juſt in his dealing, and to pay his debts, muſt be diligent in his Calling, and mind his buſineſs; becauſe without this he cannot do the other; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more vain and fond, than for a Man to pretend that he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon doing his Duty, when he neglects any thing that is neceſſary to put him into a capacity, and to further him in the diſcharge of it. This is, as if a Man ſhould reſolve to be well, and yet never take Phyſick, or be careleſs in obſerving his rules which are preſcribed in order to his health. So for a Man to reſolve againſt Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, and yet to run himſelf upon the temptations which naturally lead to it, by frequenting the Company of Lewd and Intemperate perſons, this is, as if a Man ſhould reſolve againſt the Plague, and run into the Peſt-houſe.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43767:68"/>
Whatever can reaſonably move a Man to be reſolved upon any End, will, if his Reſolution be wiſe and honeſt, determine him as ſtrongly to uſe the Means which are proper and neceſſary to that End.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the common Miſtakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter, which Men are the more willing to run into, becauſe they are loth to be brought to a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; the Nature whereof is not difficult to be underſtood, (for nothing in the world is plainer;) only men are always ſlow to underſtand what they have no mind to put in practice. But</p>
            <p n="2">II. Beſides theſe Miſtakes about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, there is another great Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage in this matter, and that is the delay of Repentance; men are loth to ſet about it, and therefore they put it upon the laſt hazard, and reſolve then to huddle it up as well as they can: but this certainly is great folly, to be ſtill making more work for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, becauſe it is to create ſo much needleſs trouble and vexation to our ſelves; 'tis to go on ſtill in playing a fooliſh part, in hopes to retrieve all
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43767:68"/>
by an after-game; this is extreamly dangerous, becauſe we may certainly ſin, but it is not certain we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, our Repentance may be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we may be cut off in our ſins; but if we ſhould have ſpace for it, Repentance may in proceſs of time grow an hundred times more difficult than it is at preſent.</p>
            <p>But if it were much more certain, and more eaſie than it is, if it were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a hearty Sorrow and Shame for our ſins, and an asking God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs for them, without being put to the trouble of reforming our wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lives, yet this were great folly, to do thoſe things which will certainly grieve us after we have done them, and put us to ſhame, and to ask for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs for them. It was well ſaid of Old <hi>Cato, nae tu ſtultus es homuncio, qui malis veniam precari, quam non peccare, thou art a fooliſh man indeed, who chuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rather to ask forgiveneſs, than not to offend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the beſt, Repentance implies a fault; it is an after-Wiſdom, which ſuppoſeth a Man firſt to have plaid
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43767:69"/>
the fool; it is but the beſt end of a bad buſineſs; a hard ſhift, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate hazard, which a Man that had acted prudently would never have been put to; it is a Plaſter after we have dangerouſly wounded our ſelves: but certainly it had been much wiſer, to have prevented the danger of the wound, and the pain of curing it. A wiſe Man would not make himſelf ſick if he could, or if he were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſo, would not make himſelf ſicker, tho' he had the moſt Effectual and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Remedy in the world in his power: But this is not the caſe of a ſinner, for Repentance as well as Faith is the gift of God.</p>
            <p>Above all, let me caution you, not to put off this great and neceſſary work, to the moſt unſeaſonable time of all other, the time of ſickneſs and death, upon a fond preſumption, that you can be reconciled to God when you pleaſe, and exerciſe ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as will make your peace with him at any time.</p>
            <p>I am heartily afraid, that a very great part of Mankind do miſcarry
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43767:69"/>
upon this confidence, and are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the gulf of Eternal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, with this Plank in their Arms. The common Cuſtom is (and I fear it is too common) when the Phyſician hath given over his Patient, then, and not till then, to ſend for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; not ſo much to enquire into the Man's condition, and to give him ſuitable Advice, as to Miniſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and to ſpeak Peace to him at a venture.</p>
            <p>But let me tell you, that herein you put an extream difficult task up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, in expecting that we ſhould pour Wine and Oyl into the wound before it be ſearched, and ſpeak ſmooth and comfortable things to a Man, that is but juſt brought to a ſenſe of the long courſe of a lewd and wicked Life, impenitently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in. Alas! what comfort can we give to men in ſuch a caſe? We are loth to drive them to deſpair; and yet we muſt not deſtroy them by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; pity and good nature do ſtrongly tempt us to make the beſt of their caſe, and to give them all the little hopes, which with any kind of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43767:70"/>
we can, and God knows it is but very little that we can give to ſuch Perſons upon good ground; for it all depends upon the degree and ſincerity of their Repentance, which God only knows, and we can but gueſs at. We can eaſily tell them what they ought to have done, and what they ſhould do, if they were to live longer, and what is the beſt that they can do in thoſe ſtraights into which they have brought themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> to exerciſe as deep a Sorrow and Repentance for their ſins as is poſſible, and <hi>to cry mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God</hi> for Mercy, in and through the Merit of our Bleſſed Saviour. But how far this will be available in theſe Circumſtances we cannot tell; becauſe we do not know, whether if the Man had lived longer, this Repentance and theſe Reſolutions which he now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares of a better courſe, would have been good.</p>
            <p>And after all is done that can be done in ſo ſhort a time, and in ſuch Circumſtances of confuſion and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as commonly attend dying Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I doubt the reſult of all will be this; that there is much more ground
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43767:70"/>
of fear than hope concerning them; nay perhaps, while we are preſſing the dying ſinner to Repentance, and he is bungling about it, he expires in great doubt and perplexity of mind what will become of him; or if his Eyes be cloſed with more comfortable hopes of his condition, the next time he opens them again, he may find his fearful miſtake, like the rich Man in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, who when he was <hi>in hell, lift up his eyes being in torment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a very diſmal and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſideration, and commands all men preſently to repent, and not to put off the main work of their lives to the end of them, and the time of ſickneſs and old Age. Let us not offer up a Carcaſs to God inſtead of a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and acceptable Sacrifice: but let us turn to God, in the days of our health and ſtrength, <hi>before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, of which we ſhall ſay we have no pleaſure in them; before the Sun and the Moon and the Stars be darkned.</hi> As <hi>Solomon</hi> elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſeth it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.1, 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Comforts of Life be gone, before our Faculties be all ceaſed and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43767:71"/>
ſpent, before our Underſtandings be too weak, and our Wills too ſtrong; our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings be too weak for conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the deliberate exerciſe of Repentance, and our Wills too ſtrong and ſtiff to be bent and bowed to it.</p>
            <p>Let us not deceive our ſelves, Heaven is not an Hoſpital made to receive all Sick and Aged Perſons, that can but put up a faint requeſt to be admitted there; no, no, they are never like to <hi>ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> who inſtead of <hi>ſeeking it in the firſt place,</hi> make it their <hi>laſt refuge and retreat,</hi> and when they find the Sentence of Death upon them, only to avoid preſent Execution, do bethink themſelves of getting to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſince there is no other Remedy, are contented to Petition the great King and Judge of the World, that they may be <hi>tranſported</hi> thither.</p>
            <p>Upon all theſe Conſiderations, let us uſe no delay in a matter of ſuch migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſequence to our eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but let the <hi>counſel</hi> which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar be acceptable to us</hi>; let us <hi>Break off our ſins by righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and our iniquities by ſhewing mercy
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43767:71"/>
to the poor; if ſo be it may be a length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our tranquillity.</hi> Repentance and Alms do well together; let us <hi>break off our ſins by righteouſneſs and our iniquities by ſhewing mercy to the poor</hi>; eſpecially upon this great occaſion, which his Majeſty's great Goodneſs to thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Strangers, that have taken Sanctuary among us, hath lately preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us withal, <hi>remembring that we alſo are in the body,</hi> and liable to the like ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and conſidering on the one hand, that Gracious promiſe of our Lord, <hi>Bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall receive mercy</hi>; and on the other hand, that terrible threatning in St. <hi>James, He ſhall have Judgment without mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, from all that hath been ſaid, let us take up a preſent Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a better courſe, and enter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon it, <hi>to day whilſt it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin. O that men were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end. And grant we beſeech the Almighty God, that we may all know and do, in this our day, the things which belong to our peace,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43767:72"/>
for thy mercy's ſake in Jeſus Chriſt, To whom with thee O Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and Glory now and for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <p>What fruit had ye then in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed? For the end of thoſe things is death. But now being made free from ſin, and become Servants to God, ye have your fruit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Holineſs, and the end Everlaſting Life.</p>

            <p>THERE are two Paſſions which do always in ſome Degree or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accompany a true Repentance, <hi>viz.</hi> Sorrow and Shame for our Sins;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43767:73"/>
becauſe theſe are neceſſary to engage men to a Reſolution of making that change wherein Repentance does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt:<note place="margin">Vol. 8.</note> For till we are heartily ſorry for what we have done, and aſhamed of the evil of it, it is not likely that we ſhould ever come to a firm and ſteady purpoſe of forſaking our evil ways, and betaking our ſelves to a better courſe.</p>
            <p>And theſe two Paſſions of Sorrow and Shame for our Sins, were wont an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to be ſignified by thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſions of Humiliation and Repentance, which we find ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioned in Scripture, of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloathed in Sackcloath</hi> as a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our ſorrow and mourning for our Sins, and of <hi>being ſprinkled upon the head, and covered over with filth and dirt, with duſt and aſhes,</hi> in token of our ſhame and confuſion of Face for all our Iniquities and tranſgreſſions. Hence are thoſe Expreſſions in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of <hi>Repenting in Sackcloath and Aſhes, of lying down in our ſhame,</hi> and <hi>being cover'd with confuſion,</hi> in token of their great ſorrow and ſhame for the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43767:73"/>
manifold and heinous Sins, which they had been guilty of.</p>
            <p>Of the former of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Sorrow for our Sins, I have very lately <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ser.</hi> 3.</note> treated; and of the latter, I intend now by God's aſſiſtance to ſpeak, <hi>viz.</hi> Shame for our Sins, and that from theſe Words which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to you; <hi>What fruit had ye then in thoſe things,</hi> &amp;c. In which Words the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle makes a compariſon between an Holy and Virtuous, and a Sinful and Vicious courſe of Life, and ſets before us a perfect enumeration of the manifeſt Inconveniences of the one, and the manifold Advantages of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The manifeſt Inconveniences of a Vicious and Sinful courſe; and the Apoſtle mentions theſe <hi>three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. It is unprofitable, it brings no manner of preſent Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us, if all things be rightly calculated and conſider'd. <hi>What fruit had ye then in thoſe things? Then (i. e.)</hi> at the time when you committed thoſe Sins, had you any preſent Advantage
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43767:74"/>
by them? No, certainly; but quite contrary.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The reflection upon our Sins af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards is cauſe of ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to us; <hi>What fruit had you then in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. The final iſſue and conſequence of theſe things is very diſmal and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable; <hi>The end of thoſe things is death.</hi> Let us put theſe things together, and ſee what they amount to: No Fruit then when ye did theſe things, and ſhame now when ye come afterwards to reflect upon them, and death and miſery at the laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here is likewiſe on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand repreſented to us the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Benefit of an Holy and Virtuous Life. And that upon theſe <hi>two</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Of the preſent Benefit of it, which the Apoſtle calls here <hi>fruit; Ye have your fruit unto Holineſs.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:43767:74"/>II. In reſpect of the future Reward of it; <hi>And the end Everlaſting Life.</hi> Here is a conſiderable Earneſt in hand, and a mighty Recompence afterwards, infinitely beyond the proportion of our beſt Actions and Services, both in reſpect of the greatneſs and the duration of it, <hi>Everlaſting Life</hi>; for a few tranſient and very imperfect actions of obedience, a perfect and immutable and endleſs ſtate of Happineſs. I ſhall begin with the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> of the <hi>two</hi> general Heads. <hi>viz.</hi> The manifeſt Inconveniences of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Vicious courſe; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle I told you in the Text takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. It is unprofitable, and if all things be rightly calculated and conſider'd, it brings no manner of preſent Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Benefit to us. <hi>What fruit had ye then in thoſe things? Then, (i. e.)</hi> When ye committed thoſe Sins, had you any preſent Advantage by them? No certainly, quite the contrary; as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, if you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly reflect upon your former courſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43767:75"/>
of Impiety and Sin, wherein you have continued ſo long, you cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that it brought no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of advantage to you; and when all accounts are truly caſt up, you muſt, if you will confeſs the Truth, own that you were in no ſort gainers by it: For the words are a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the Apoſtle plainly intends more than he expreſſeth, <hi>What fruit had ye then in thoſe things? (i. e.)</hi> The wicked courſe which ye formerly lived in, was ſo far from being any ways Beneficial to you, that it was on the contrary upon all accounts extreamly to your prejudice and diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>And this is not only true in reſpect of the final Iſſue and Conſequence of a Sinful and Vicious courſe of Life, that no Man is a gainer by it at the long run, and if we take into our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration another World, and the dreadful and endleſs miſery which a wicked and impenitent Life will then plunge men into, (which in the farther handling of this Text will at large be ſpoken to, being the laſt of the <hi>three</hi> Particulars under this <hi>Firſt</hi> general head:) But it is true likewiſe,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43767:75"/>
even in reſpect of this World, and with regard only to this preſent and temporal Life, without looking ſo far as the future Recompence and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin in another World.</p>
            <p>And this would plainly appear, by an Induction of theſe <hi>three</hi> Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is Evident that ſome Sins are plainly miſchievous to the temporal Intereſt of men, as tending either to the diſturbance of their minds, or the endangering of their Health and Lives, or to the prejudice of their Eſtates, or the blaſting of them in their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and good name.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there are other Sins, which tho' they are not ſo viſibly burdened and attended with miſchievous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, yet are they plainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and bring no manner of real Advantage to men, either in reſpect of gain or pleaſure; ſuch are the Sins of Profaneneſs, and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Swearing in common Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:43767:76"/>3. That even thoſe Sins and Vices, which make the faireſt pretence to be of Advantage to us, when all Accounts are caſt up, and all Circumſtances duly weigh'd and conſider'd, will be found to be but pretenders, and in no degree able to perform and make good what they ſo largely promiſe before hand, when they tempt us to the commiſſion of them. There are ſome Vices, which pretend to bring in great profit, and tempt worldly-minded men, whoſe minds are diſpoſed to catch at that bait; ſuch are the Sins of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Oppreſſion, of Fraud and Falſhood and Perfidiouſneſs. And there are others which pretend to bring pleaſure along with them, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an irreſiſtable temptation to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous and ſenſual men; ſuch are the Sins of Revenge, and Intemperance, and Luſt. But upon a particular exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of each of theſe, it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, that there is no ſuch profit or pleaſure in any of theſe Vices, as can be a reaſonable temptation to any Man to fall in love with them, and to engage in the Commiſſion and Practice of them. But I ſhall not now
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43767:76"/>
inlarge upon any of theſe, having lately diſcours'd upon them from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Text. I ſhall therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Inconvenience which I mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of a ſinful and vicious Courſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the reflection upon our Sins afterwards, is cauſe of great Shame and Confuſion to us. <hi>What fruit had you then in thoſe things, whereof you are now aſhamed?</hi> And this is a very proper Argument for this Seaſon <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Preach'd in Lent.</hi>
               </note>; becauſe the Paſſion of Shame, as it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and uſual conſequent of Sin, ſo it is a Diſpoſition neceſſarily required to a true Repentance.</p>
            <p>Moſt Men when they commit a known Fault are apt to be aſhamed, and ready to bluſh, whenever they are put in mind of it, and charged with it. Some Perſons indeed have gone ſo far in Sin, and have waded ſo deep in a vicious courſe, as to be confirmed and harden'd in their Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs to that degree, as to be paſt all Shame, and almoſt all ſenſe of their Faults; eſpecially in regard of the more common and ordinary Vices,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43767:77"/>
which are in vogue and faſhion, and in the commiſſion whereof they are countenanc'd and encourag'd by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Example. Such were thoſe of whom the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Were they aſhamed, when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not aſhamed, neither could they bluſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet even theſe Perſons, when they come to be ſenſible of their guilt, ſo as to be brought to Repentance, they cannot then but be aſhamed of what they have done. For what face ſoever Men may ſet upon their Vices, Sin is ſhameful in it ſelf, and ſo apt to fill Men with <hi>confuſion of face,</hi> when they ſeriouſly reflect upon it, that they cannot harden their Foreheads againſt all ſenſe of Shame. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Men may declare to the contrary, this is tacitly acknowledged by the generality of Men; in that they are ſo ſolicitous and careful to conceal their Faults from the Eyes of others, and to keep them as ſecret as they can; and whenever they are diſcovered, and laid open, 'tis matter of great Trouble and Confuſion to them; and if any one happen to upbraid and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43767:77"/>
twit them with their Miſcarriages of any kind, they cannot bear with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to hear of them.</p>
            <p>There are indeed ſome few ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies and Monſters of Men, as are able after great ſtruglings with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, to force themſelves to boaſt impudently of their Wickedneſs, and <hi>to glory in their ſhame</hi>; not becauſe they do really and inwardly believe their Vices to be an Honour and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them, but becauſe conſcious to themſelves that they have done ſhameful things, and believing that others know it, they put on <hi>a Whore's Forehead,</hi> and think to prevent the upbraiding of others, by owning what they have done, and ſeeming to glory in it: but yet for all that, theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, if they would confeſs the Truth, do feel ſome Confuſion in themſelves, and they are inwardly ſenſible of the Infamy and Reproach of ſuch Actions, for all they would ſeem to the World to bear it out ſo well: For when all is done, there is a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Impudence of a Criminal, and the Confidence and Aſſurance of a clear Conſcience, that is fully ſatisfied
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43767:78"/>
of its own Innocence and Integrity. The conſcientious Man is not aſhamed of any thing that he hath done: but the impudent Sinner only ſeems not to be ſo, but all the while feels a great deal of Confuſion in his own Mind. The one is ſenſible and ſatisfied that there is no cauſe for Shame: the other is conſcious to himſelf that there is cauſe, but he offers Violence to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſuppreſſes all he can the ſenſe and ſhew of it, and will needs face down the World, that he hath no Guilt and Regret in his own Mind for any thing that he hath done.</p>
            <p>Now that Sin is truly matter of Shame, will be very evident, if we conſider theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If we conſider the nature of this Paſſion of Shame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we conſider what there is in Sin, which gives real ground and occaſion for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the nature of this Paſſion. Shame is the Trouble or Confuſion of Mind, occaſioned by ſomething that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43767:78"/>
tends to our Diſgrace and Diſhonour, to our Infamy and Reproach. Now there is nothing truly and really mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Shame and Reproach to us, but what we our ſelves have done, or have been ſome way or other acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the doing of, by our own fault or neglect, and by conſequence what it was in our Power and Choice not to have done: For no Man is aſhamed of what he is ſure he could not help. Neceſſity, unleſs it be wilful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and happens through ſome precedent occaſion and fault of our own, does take away all juſt cauſe of Shame.</p>
            <p>And nothing likewiſe is matter of Shame, but ſomething which we ought not to do, which misbecomes us, and is below the Dignity and Perfection of our Nature, and is againſt ſome Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Obligation that is upon us to the contrary; and conſequently is a Reproach to our Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, a Reflection upon our Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Diſcretion, and at firſt ſight hath an appearance of Rugged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nſs and Deformity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:43767:79"/>And all Actions of this nature do receive ſeveral Aggravations, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Perſons againſt whom, and in whoſe Preſence, and under whoſe Eye and Knowledge theſe ſhameful things are done. Now I ſhall ſhew in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> place, That Sin contains in it whatſoever is juſtly accounted infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, together with all the Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Shame and Reproach that can be imagined. And this will appear by conſidering Sin and Vice in theſe <hi>two</hi> reſpects;</p>
            <p n="1">I. In relation to our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In reſpect to God, againſt whom, and in whoſe ſight it is committed.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In relation to our ſelves, there are theſe <hi>four</hi> things which make Sin and Vice to be very ſhameful.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The natural Ruggedneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:43767:79"/>2. That it is ſo great a Diſhonour to our Nature, and to the Dignity and Excellency of our Being.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is ſo great a Reproach to our Reaſon and Underſtanding, and ſo foul a Reflection upon our Prudence and Diſcretion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it is our own voluntary Act and Choice.</p>
            <p>Every one of theſe Conſiderations render it very ſhameful, and all of them together ought to fill the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with <hi>Confuſion of face.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak to them ſeverally.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The natural Ruggedneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Sin and Vice render it very ſhameful Men are apt to be aſhamed of any thing in them, or belonging to them, that looks ugly and monſtrous, and therefore they endeavour with great Care and Art to conceal and diſſemble their Deformity in any kind. How ſtrangely do we ſee Men concerned with all their Diligence and Skill, to cover and palliate any Defect or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43767:80"/>
in their Bodies; an ill Face, if they could, however a foul and bad Complexion, or blind or ſquint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eye, a crooked Body or Limb, and whatever is ill-favour'd or mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous. Now in regard of our Souls and better part, Sin hath all the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſneſs and deformity in it, which we can imagine in the Body, and much more; and it is as hard to be covered from the Eye of diſcerning Men, as the deformity of the Body is; but impoſſible to be conceal'd from the Eye of God, to whom <hi>Darkneſs and Light,</hi> ſecret and open are all one. But then the moral Defects and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities of the Mind have this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage above the natural Defects and Deformities of the Body, that the former are poſſible to be cured by the Grace of God, in Conjunction with our own Care and Endeavour: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as no Diligence or Skill can ever help or remove many of the natural Defects and Deformities of the Body.</p>
            <p>Sin is the blindneſs of our Minds, the perverſeneſs and crookedneſs of our Wills, and the monſtrous irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and diſorder of our Affections
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43767:80"/>
and Appetites; it is the miſ-placing of our Powers and Faculties, the ſetting of our Wills and Paſſions above our Reaſon; all which is ugly and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and, if we were truly ſenſible of it, matter of great Shame and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to us.</p>
            <p>There is hardly any Vice, but at firſt ſight hath an odious and ugly Appearance to a well diſciplin'd and innocent Mind, that hath never had any acquaintance with it. And however Familiarity and Cuſtom may abate the ſenſe of it's Deformity, yet it is at it was before, and the change that is made in us, does not alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing. Drunkenneſs and furious Paſſion, Pride and Faſhood, Covetouſneſs and Cruelty, are odious, and matter of Shame, in the ſincere and uncorrupted Opinion of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And tho' a Man, by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Practice of any of theſe Vices, and a long familiarity with them, may not be ſo ſenſible of the Deformity of them in himſelf, yet he quickly diſcerns the uglineſs of them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when ever they come in his way, and could with Salt and Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43767:81"/>
enough upbraid thoſe whom he ſees guilty of them, but that he is inwardly conſcious, that the Reproach may be ſo eaſily return'd, and thrown back upon himſelf. However this is a natural acknowledgment of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and Shamefulneſs of Sin and Vice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are likewiſe ſhameful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo great a Diſhonour to our Nature, and to the Dignity and Excellency of our Being. We go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our ſelves, and act beneath the Dignity of our Nature, when we do any thing contrary to the Rules and Laws of it, or to the revealed Will of God; becauſe theſe are the Bounds and Limits which God and Nature hath ſet to Humane Actions; and are the meaſures of our Duty, <hi>i. e.</hi> what is fit and becoming for us to do, and what not. So that all Sin and Vice is baſe and unworthy, and beneath the Dignity of our Nature; it argues a corrupt and diſeaſed Conſtitution and Habit of Mind, a crooked and perverſe Diſpoſition of Will, and a ſordid and mean temper of Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:43767:81"/>And therefore the Scripture doth frequently repreſent a ſtate of Sin and Wickedneſs, by that which is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the baſeſt and meaneſt Condition among Men, by a ſtate of Servitude and Slavery, eſpecially if it had been our Choice, or the evident and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Conſequence of our wilful Fault: For we do as bad as chuſe it, when we wilfully bring it upon our ſelves. So that to be a Sinner, is to be a Slave to ſome vile Luſt, Appetite, or Paſſion, to ſome unnatural or irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Deſire; it is to ſell our ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Bondage, and to part with one of the moſt valuable things in the World, our Liberty, upon low and unworthy terms. Such a State and Condition does unavoidably debaſe and debauch our Minds, and break the force and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Spirits, and robs us, as <hi>Dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> did <hi>Sampſon,</hi> of our Strength and Courage, of our Reſolution and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; ſo that Men have not the Heart left to deſign and endeavour in good earneſt their own Reſcue out of this mean and miſerable eſtate, into which by their own Folly and Fault they have brought themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:43767:82"/>When Men are engaged into a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of ſinning, and have habituated themſelves to any vicious Courſe, how do they betray their Weakneſs and want of Reſolution, by being at the beck of every fooliſh Luſt, and by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering themſelves to be commanded and burried away by every unruly Appetite and Paſſion, to do things which they know to be greatly to their Harm and Prejudice, and which they are convinced are mean and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did things, and ſuch as they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed that any wiſe Man ſhould ſee them doing! And there is no greater Argument of a pitiful and degenerate Spirit, than to commit ſuch things as a Man would bluſh to be ſurprized in, and would be mightily troubled to hear of afterwards. And which is more, after he hath been convinc'd by manifold Experience, that they are a Shame and Diſgrace to him, and make him to hang down his Head, and let fall his Countenance, whenever he is in better Company than himſelf; yet after this to go and do the ſame things again, which he is ſenſible are ſo ſhameful, and to be ſo impotent,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43767:82"/>
and to have ſo little Command of himſelf, as not to be able to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from this Bondage, nor the heart to pray to God that by his Grace he would enable him hereto.</p>
            <p>And that Sin is of this ſhameful Nature, is evident, in that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Sinners take ſo much Care and Pains to hide their Vices from the ſight and notice of Men, and to this purpoſe chuſe Darkneſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret places of Retirement to commit their Sins in. The Apoſtle takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that thus much Modeſty was left even in a very wicked and degenerate Age, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.7. <hi>They that be drunk</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are drunk in the night.</hi> Now all this is a plain acknowledgment, that Sin is a ſpurious and degenerate thing, that it misbecomes Humane Nature, and is below the Dignity of a reaſonable Creature: Otherwiſe why ſhould Men be ſo ſolicitous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to cover their Faults from the ſight of others? If they are not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them, why do they not bring them into the broad Light, and ſhew them openly, if they think they will endure it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:43767:83"/>So true is that Obſervation which <hi>Plato</hi> makes, That tho' a Man were ſure that God would forgive his Sins, and that Men ſhould never know them, yet there is that Baſeneſs in Sin, that a wiſe Man, that conſiders what it is, would bluſh to himſelf alone to be guilty of it; and tho' he were not afraid of the Puniſhment, would be aſhamed of the Turpitude and Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of it.</p>
            <p>Did but a Man conſider ſeriouſly with himſelf, how mean and unmanly it is for a Man to be drunk; and what an apiſh and ridiculous thing he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders himſelf to all ſober Men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, and with what Contempt and Scorn they entertain ſuch a ſight; and how brutiſh it is to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in any unlawful Luſt, and how much a Man deſcends and ſtoops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath himſelf; what ſhameful Fear and Cowardiſe he betrays when he is frighted to tell a Lye out of Fear, or tempted thereto for ſome little Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and yet is ſo inconſiſtent with himſelf, as to have, or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have the Courage to fight any
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43767:83"/>
Man, that ſhall tell him ſo ſawcy a Truth, as that he told a Lye.</p>
            <p>Would but a Man think before hand, how unworthy, and how une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual a thing it is, to defraud or cheat his Brother, or to do any thing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man, which he would be loth in the like caſe that he ſhould do to him; how baſe a thing it is, for a Man to be perfidious and falſe to his Promiſe or Truſt; how monſtrous to be unthankful to one that hath highly obliged him, and every way and upon all occaſions deſerved well at his Hands; and ſo I might inſtance in all other ſorts of Sins; I ſay, he that conſiders this well and wiſely, tho' there were no Law againſt Sin, and (if it were a poſſible caſe, and fit to be ſuppoſed) tho' there were no ſuch Being as God in the World, to call him to account and puniſh him for it, yet out of meer Generoſity and Greatneſs of Mind, out of pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to himſelf, and the Dignity and Rank of his Being, and of his Order in the World, out of very Reverence to Humane Nature, and the inward Perſwaſion of his own Mind, (howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43767:84"/>
he came by that Perſwaſion) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Indeceny and Deformity and Shamefulneſs of the thing, I ſay, for theſe Reaſons, if there were no other, a Man would ſtrive with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with all his might, to refrain from Sin and Vice, and not only bluſh, but abhor to think of doing a wicked Action.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sin will yet farther appear ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in that it is ſo great a Reproach to our Underſtandings and Reaſons, and ſo foul a Blot upon our Prudence and Diſcretion. <hi>Omnis peccans aut ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norans eſt, aut incogitans,</hi> is a Saying, I think, of one of the School-men; (as one would gueſs by the <hi>Latin</hi> of it) <hi>Every Sinner is either an ignorant, or inconſiderate Perſon.</hi> Either Men do not underſtand what they do, when they commit Sin; or if they do know, they do not actually attend to, and conſider what they know: Either they are habitually or actually igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what they do: for Sin and Conſideration cannot dwell together; 'tis ſo very unreaſonable and abſurd a thing, that it requires either groſs Ignorance, or ſtupid Inadvertency, to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43767:84"/>
make a Man capable of committing it. Whenever a Man ſins, he muſt either be deſtitute of Reaſon, or muſt lay it aſide or aſleep for the time, and ſo ſuffer himſelf to be hurried away, and to act <hi>brutiſhly,</hi> as if <hi>he had no underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did but Men attentively conſider what it is to offend God, and to break the Laws of that great Law-giver, who <hi>is able to ſave or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy,</hi> they would diſcern ſo many invincible Objections againſt the thing, and would be filled with ſuch ſtrong Fears and Jealouſies of the fatal Iſſue and Event of it, that they would not dare to venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. And therefore we find the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſo frequently reſolving the Wickedneſs of Men into their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Inconſiderateneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?</hi> intimating that by their Actions one would judge ſo. And the ſame account God himſelf alſo gives elſewhere of the frequent Diſobedience and Rebellion of the People of <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 32.28, 29.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43767:85"/>
               <hi>They are a nation void of counſel, neither is there any underſtanding in them. Oh! that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end!</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Conſideration would cure a great part of the Wickedneſs that is in the World; Men would not <hi>commit Sin with</hi> ſo much <hi>gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs,</hi> would they but take time to conſider, and bethink themſelves what they do.</p>
            <p>Have we not reaſon then to be aſhamed of Sin, which caſts ſuch a reproach of Ignorance and Raſhneſs upon us? and of Imprudence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and Indiſcretion? Since nothing can be more directly and plainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our greateſt and beſt Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt both of Body and Soul, both here and hereafter, both now and to all Eternity. And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that Men are more aſhamed of, than to be guilty of ſo great an Imprudence, as to act clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own Intereſt, to which Sin is the moſt plainly croſs and contrary, that it is poſſible for any thing to be. No Man can
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43767:85"/>
engage and continue in a ſinful Courſe, without being ſo far abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and infatuated, as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to part with Everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and to be undone and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable for ever; none but he that can perſwade himſelf againſt all the Reaſon and Senſe of Mankind, that there is pleaſure enough in the tranſient acts of Sin, to make amends for Eternal Sorrow, and Shame, and Suffering. And can ſuch a Thought as this enter into the Heart of a conſiderate Man? <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurus</hi> was ſo wiſe, as to conclude againſt all Pleaſure that would give a Man more Trouble and Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance afterwards; againſt all Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that had Pain and Grief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon them; and he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids his Wiſe Man to taſte of them, or to meddle with them; and had he believed any thing of a future State, he muſt, according to his Principle, have pronounc'd it the greateſt Folly that could be, for any Man to purchaſe the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Happineſs of a few Years, at the dear rate of Eternal Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43767:86"/>
and Torment. So that if it be a Diſgrace to a Man to act impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and to do things plainly againſt his Intereſt, then Vice is the greateſt reproach that is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>The 4<hi>th</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> Conſideration, which renders Sin ſo ſhameful to us, is, that it is our own Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Act and Choice. We chuſe this Diſgrace and willingly bring this Reproach upon our ſelves. We pity an Ideot, and one that is naturally deſtitute of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or one that loſeth the uſe of his Reaſon by a Diſeaſe or other inevitable accident: But every one deſpiſeth him who beſots himſelf, and plays the fool out of careleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a groſs neglect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And this is the Caſe of the Sinner; there is no Man that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but becauſe he is wanting to himſelf; he might be wiſer and do better, and will not; but he chuſeth his own Devices, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily runs himſelf upon thoſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43767:86"/>
inconveniences, which it was in his Power to have avoided.</p>
            <p>Not but that I do heartily own and lament the great Corruption and Degeneracy of our Nature, and the ſtrong Propenſions which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo early in us to that which is Evil: but God hath provided a Remedy and Cure for all this: For ſince <hi>the Grace of God, which brings Salvation unto all men, hath appeared,</hi> under the influence and through the aſſiſtance of that Grace, which is offer'd to them by the Goſpel, men may <hi>deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World.</hi> For I make no doubt, but ſince God hath enter'd into a new Covenant of Grace with Mankind, and offered new Terms of Life and Salvation to us, I ſay I doubt not, but his Grace is ready at hand, to enable us to perform all thoſe Conditions which he requires of us, if we be not wanting to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:43767:87"/>There was a way of Salvation eſtabliſhed, before the Goſpel was clearly reveal'd to the World, and they who under that Diſpenſation, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſincerely endeavour'd to do the will of God, ſo far as they knew it, were not utterly deſtitute of Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance: But now there is a more plentiful Effuſion of God's Grace and Holy Spirit; ſo that whoever under the Goſpel ſins deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately, ſins wilfully, and is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not for want of Power but of Will to do otherwiſe. And this is that which makes Sin ſo ſhameful a thing, and ſo very reproachful to us, that we deſtroy our ſelves by our own folly and neglect of our ſelves, and become miſerable by our own choice; and when the Grace of God hath put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Power to be wiſe and to be happy.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now have proceeded to the <hi>Second</hi> thing I propoſed, which was to conſider Sin in relation to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43767:87"/>
God, and to ſhew that it is no leſs ſhameful in that reſpect, than I have ſhewn it to be with regard to our ſelves: But this I ſhall refer to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oportunity.</p>

            <p>IN theſe words the Apoſtle makes a compariſon, between an Holy and Virtuous, and a Sinful and Vicious courſe of Life, and ſets before us a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43767:89"/>
perfect enumeration of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt inconveniences of the one,<note place="margin">Vol. 8.</note> and the manifold advantages of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>I began with the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew the manifeſt inconveniences of a ſinful and vicious courſe. I am upon the <hi>Second</hi> inconvenience of a ſinful courſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the reflection upon it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is cauſe of great Shame and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of face</hi> to us; and that</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> in Relation to our ſelves. Which I have diſpatch'd, and proceed now in the,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Place, to conſider Sin in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God, againſt whom, and in whoſe ſight and preſence it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and upon examination it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to be no leſs ſhameful in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect than the other.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Perſons before whom we are more apt to be aſhamed and bluſh, than before others; as thoſe whom we reverence, thoſe to whom we are greatly oblig'd, and thoſe who are clear of thoſe faults which we are
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43767:89"/>
guilty of; and thoſe who hate or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſlike what we do; eſpecially if they be preſent with us, and in our company; if they ſtand by us and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and take notice of what we do, and are likely to publiſh our folly and make it known, and have Authority and Power to puniſh us for our faults; we are aſhamed to have done any thing that is vile and unworthy before ſuch Perſons. Now to render Sin the more Shameful, God may be conſider'd by us under all theſe Notions, and in all theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whenever we commit any Sin, we do it before him, in his preſence, and under his eye and knowledge, to whom of all perſons in the world we ought to pay the moſt profound reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. I remember <hi>Seneca</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſays; that
<q>There are ſome Perſons, <hi>quorum interventû perditi quoque homines vitia ſupprimerent,</hi> that are ſo awful and ſo generally reverenc'd for the eminency of their Virtues, that even the moſt profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and impudent ſinners will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſuppreſs their Vices, and refrain from any thing that is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43767:90"/>
bad, and uncomely, whilſt ſuch Perſons ſtand by them, and are in preſence.</q>
Such an one was <hi>Cato</hi> among the <hi>Romans.</hi> The People of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſuch a Regard and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for him, that if he appeared, they would not begin or continue their uſual ſports, till he was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the Theatre, thinking them too light to be acted before a Perſon of his Gravity and Virtue: And if they were ſo much aw'd by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Wiſe and a Virtuous Man, that they were aſhamed to do any thing that was unſeemly before him; how much more ſhould the preſence of the Holy God, who is <hi>of purer eyes, than to behold iniquity,</hi> make us bluſh to do any thing that is lewd and vile in his ſight, and fill us with ſhame and <hi>confuſion of face</hi> at the thoughts of it? Now whenever we commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sin, God looks upon us; and he alone is an ample Theatre indeed. That he obſerves what we do, ought to be more to us, than if the Eyes of all the World beſides were gazing upon us.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:43767:90"/>2. He likewiſe is incomparably our greateſt Benefactour, and there is no Perſon in the World, to whom in any degree we ſtand ſo much oblig'd, as to him; and from whom we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and hope for ſo much good, as from him; the conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of muſt make us aſhamed, ſo often as we conſider, and are conſcious to our ſelves, that we have done any thing that is grievous and diſpleaſing to him.</p>
            <p>We are wont to have a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Reverence for thoſe to whom we are exceedingly beholden, and to be much aſhamed to do any thing before them, which may ſignifie diſreſpect, and much more enmity againſt them; becauſe this would be horrible ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, one of the moſt odious and ſhameful of all Vices. And is there any one to whom we can ſtand more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, than to him that made us, than to the Author and Founder of our Beings, and the great Patron and Preſerver of our lives? And can there then be any before whom, and againſt whom we ſhould be more aſhamed to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43767:91"/>
offend? When the Prodigal in the Parable would ſet forth the ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Miſcarriage, he aggravates it from hence, that he had offended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt and before one to whom he had been ſo infinitely obliged. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have ſinned againſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in thy ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We are aſhamed likewiſe to be guilty of any fault or crime before thoſe Perſons who are clear of it, or of any thing of the like nature them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Men are not apt to be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before thoſe who are their fellow-Criminals, and involved with them in the ſame guilt, becauſe they do not ſtand in awe of them, nor can have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reverence for them. Thoſe, who are equally guilty, muſt bear with one another. We are not apt to fear the cenſures and reproofs of thoſe, who are as bad as our ſelves: but we are aſhamed to do a foul and unworthy Action, before thoſe who are innocent and free from the ſame, or the like Sins and Vices which we are guilty of.</p>
            <p>Now whenever we commit any Sin, it is in the preſence of the Holy God,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43767:91"/>
who hath no part with us in our crimes, whoſe nature is removed at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt diſtance from Sin, and is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it as can be. <hi>There is no ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with the Lord our God.</hi> And therefore of all Perſons in the World we ſhould bluſh to be guilty of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We are apt alſo to be aſhamed to do any thing before thoſe who diſlike and deteſt what we do. To do a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Action before thoſe who are not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at it, or perhaps take pleaſure in it, is no ſuch matter of ſhame to us. Now of all others, God is the greateſt hater of Sin, and the moſt perfect E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to it in the whole World. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes, than to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, i. e.</hi> with patience, and without an infinite hatred and abhorrence of it. Such is the unſpotted Purity and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Divine Nature, that it is not poſſible that God ſhould give the leaſt countenance to any thing that is Evil. Pſal. 5.4, 5. <hi>Thou art not a God,</hi> ſays <hi>David</hi> there to him, <hi>that haſt Pleaſure in iniquity, neither ſhall evil dwell with thee: The wicked
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43767:92"/>
ſhall not ſtand in thy ſight; thou hateſt all the workers of iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. We are aſhamed likewiſe to do any thing that is Evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly before thoſe, who we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid will publiſh our faults to others, and will make known and expoſe the folly of them. Now whenever we Sin, it is before him who will moſt certainly one day bring all our works of darkneſs into the open light, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all our ſecret deeds of diſhoneſty upon the publick Stage of the World, and make all the vileſt of our actions known, and lay them open, with all the ſhameful Circumſtances of them, before men and Angels, to our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Shame and Confuſion. This is the meaning of that Proverbial Speech, ſo often uſed by our Saviour, <hi>There is nothing cover'd, that ſhall not be revealed, neither hid that ſhall not be made manifeſt.</hi> All the Sins which we now commit with ſo much caution, in ſecret and dark retirements, ſhall in that great day of Revelation, when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be diſcloſed, be ſet in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen view, and in ſo full and ſtrong a light, that all the World ſhall ſee them;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43767:92"/>
and that which was plotted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived in ſo much ſecrecy, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whiſper'd in this World, ſhall then <hi>be proclaimed aloud,</hi> and as it were <hi>upon the Houſe-tops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We are aſhamed and afraid to commit a fault before thoſe, who we believe will call us to an account for it, and Puniſh us ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. A Man may ſuffer innocently and for a good Cauſe; but all ſuffering in that caſe, is by wiſe and good men eſteemed honourable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and tho' we are Condemned by men, we are acquitted in our own Conſciences: But that which is properly called Puniſhment is always attended with Infamy and Reproach; becauſe it always ſuppoſeth ſome fault and crime, as the ground and reaſon of it. Hence it is that in this World, men are not only afraid, but aſhamed to commit any fault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe, who they think have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power to puniſh it. He is an impudent Villain indeed, that will venture to cut a Purſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:43767:93"/>Now when ever we commit any Wickedneſs, we do it under the Eye of the great Judge of the World, who ſtedfaſtly beholds us, and whoſe Omnipotent Juſtice ſtands by us ready armed and charged for our Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and can in a moment cut us off. Every ſin that we are guilty of, in thought, word, or deed, is all in the preſence of the Holy, and Juſt, and Powerful God; whoſe Power enables him, and whoſe Holineſs and Juſtice will effectually engage him, one time or other, if a timely Repentance doth not prevent it, to inflict a terrible Puniſhment upon all the Workers of iniquity.</p>
            <p>You ſee then by all that hath been ſaid upon this Argument, how ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing ſin is, and what <hi>Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of face</hi> the reflection upon our wicked Lives ought to cauſe in all of us. <hi>What fruit had ye then in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> If ever we be brought to true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for our ſins, it cannot but be matter of great Shame to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:43767:93"/>We find in Scripture that ſhame doth continually accompany Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and is inſeparable from it. This is one Mark and Character of a true Penitent, that he is aſhamed of what he hath done. Thus <hi>Ezra,</hi> when he makes Confeſſion of the ſins of the People, he teſtifies and declares his Shame, for what they had done; <hi>I ſaid, O my God! I am aſhamed and bluſh to lift up mine Eyes to thee my God; for our iniquities are increaſed over our Heads, and our treſpaſſes are grown up to the Heavens,</hi> Ezra 9.6. And may not we of this Nation at this day take theſe words unto our ſelves, conſidering to what a ſtrange height our ſins are grown, and how iniquity abounds among us? So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> when he would expreſs the Repentance of the People of <hi>Iſrael, Jer.</hi> 3.25. <hi>We lye down</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in our ſhame, and our Confuſion covereth us, becauſe we have ſinned againſt the Lord our God.</hi> In like manner the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had in the Name of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple made an humble acknowledgment of their manifold and great Sins, he
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43767:94"/>
takes ſhame to himſelf, and them for them. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.5. <hi>We have ſinned,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled in departing from thy Precepts, and from thy Judgments. O Lord, righteouſneſs belongeth to thee; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us confuſion of face, as at this day; to the men of</hi> Judah, <hi>and to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and unto all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that are near and that are far off, through all the Countries whither thou haſt driven them, becauſe of their treſpaſs, which they have treſpaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee: O Lord! To us belongeth confuſion of face, to our Kings, to our Princes, and to our Fathers, becauſe we have ſinned againſt thee.</hi> By which we may judge, how conſiderable and eſſential a part of Repentance, this Holy Man eſteemed ſhame, for the ſins they had been guilty of, to be. And indeed upon all occaſions of ſolemn Repentance, and Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſin, this taking ſhame for their ſins is hardly ever omitted, as if there could be no ſincere Confeſſion of ſin and Repentance for it, without teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their <hi>ſhame,</hi> and <hi>Confuſion of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43767:94"/>
face</hi> upon the remembrance of their ſins.</p>
            <p>Now to ſtir up this affection of ſhame in us, let me offer to you theſe <hi>three</hi> Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Conſider what great reaſon we have to be heartily aſhamed of all the ſins and offences which we have been guilty of againſt God. It was a good old Precept of Philoſophy, <hi>that we ſhould reverence our ſelves,</hi> i. e. that we ſhould never do any thing, that ſhould be matter of Shame and Reproach to us afterwards, nothing that misbecomes us, and is unworthy of us.</p>
            <p>I have ſhewn at large, that all Sin and Vice is a diſhonour to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and beneath the Dignity of it; that it is a great reproach to our Reaſon, and directly contrary to our true and beſt Intereſt; that it hath all the aggravating circumſtances of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy and Shame; that every ſin that was at any time committed by us, was done in the preſence of one, whom of all Perſons in the World
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43767:95"/>
we have moſt Reaſon to reverence, and againſt him, to whom of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers we ſtand moſt obliged for the greateſt Favours, for innumerable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, for infinite Mercy and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Forbearance towards us, in the preſence of the Holy and Juſt God, who is at the fartheſt diſtance from ſin, and the greateſt and moſt implacable Enemy to it in the whole World, and who will one day puniſh all our faults, and expoſe us to open ſhame for them, who will <hi>bring eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work into judgment, and every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſin</hi> that ever we committed, and take Vengeance upon us for all our iniquities. So that whenever we ſin, we ſhamefully entreat our ſelves, and give the deepeſt wounds to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the eſteem of him, who is the moſt competent Judge of what is truly Honourable and Praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and cloath our ſelves with ſhame and diſhonour.</p>
            <p>We are aſhamed of Poverty, becauſe the poor Man is deſpiſed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ridiculous in the Eye of the proud and covetous rich Man, <hi>whoſe riches are his high Tower,</hi> and make
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43767:95"/>
him apt to look down upon the poor Man that is below him, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and ſcorn; we are aſhamed of a dangerous and contagious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, becauſe all men fly infectious company: but a Man may be poor or ſick by misfortune; but no Man is wicked, but by his own fault and wilful choice. Ill-natur'd and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate men will be apt to contemn us for our poverty and affliction in any kind: but by our Vices we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſelves odious to God, and to all good and conſiderate men.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Conſider that ſhame for ſin now, is the way to prevent Eternal Shame and Confuſion hereafter. For this is one great part of the Miſery of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, that the ſinner ſhall then <hi>be filled with everlaſting ſhame</hi> and <hi>confuſion</hi> at the remembrance of his faults and folly. The Eternal Miſery of wicked men is ſometimes in Scripture repreſented, as if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted only or chiefly in the Infamy and Reproach which will then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm them, when all their crimes and faults ſhall be expoſed and laid open to the view of the whole
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43767:96"/>
World. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. where the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reſurrection of the juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt is thus deſcribed; <hi>Many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life; and ſome to everlaſting ſhame and contempt</hi>: Where <hi>everlaſting life</hi> and <hi>everlaſting ſhame</hi> are oppoſed, as if Eternal ſhame were a kind of perpetual Death.</p>
            <p>In this World ſinners make an hard ſhift, by concealing or extenuating their faults, as well as they can, to ſuppreſs or leſſen their ſhame; they have not now ſo clear and full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the evil and folly of their ſin; God is pleaſed to bear with them and to ſpare them at preſent, and they do not yet feel the diſmal effects and conſequences of a wicked life: but in the next World, when <hi>the righteous judgment of God is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and the full Vials of his wrath ſhall be poured forth upon ſinners, they ſhall then <hi>be cloathed with ſhame, as with a garment,</hi> and <hi>be covered with confuſion</hi>; then they will feel the folly of their ſins, and have a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Demonſtration within themſelves
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43767:96"/>
of the infinite Evil of them; their own Conſciences will then furiouſly fly in their faces, and with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bitterneſs and rage upbraid and reproach them with the folly of their own doings; and ſo long as we are ſenſible, that we ſuffer for our own folly, ſo long we muſt unavoidably be aſhamed of what we have done. So that if ſinners ſhall be everlaſtingly tormented in another World, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follows, that they ſhall be eternally Confounded.</p>
            <p>Is it not then better to remember our ways now, and to be aſhamed and repent of them, than to bring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Shame and Confuſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves, before God, and Angels, and Men? This is the Argument which St. <hi>John</hi> uſeth, to take men off from ſin, and to engage them to Holineſs and Righteouſneſs of Life. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.28. <hi>That when he ſhall appear,</hi> that is, when he ſhall come to judge the World, <hi>we may have confidence, and not be aſhamed before him at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:43767:97"/>III. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> Conſider that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſets men at a farther diſtance from Repentance, and all hopes of their becoming better, and brings them nearer to Ruin, than Impudence in a ſinful courſe. There are too many in the World, who are ſo far from being aſhamed of their Wickedneſs, and bluſhing at the mention of their faults, that they boaſt of them, and glory in them. God often complains of this in the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as a ſad preſage of their Ruin, and an ill ſign of their deſperate and irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Condition; <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Thou hadſt a whore's forehead, and refuſedſt to be aſhamed</hi>; and <hi>Jerem.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Were they aſhamed when they committed abominations? Nay, they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, neither could they bluſh: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall fall among them that fall, and in the time that I viſit them, they ſhall be caſt down.</hi> Hear likewiſe how the Apoſtle doth lament the caſe of ſuch Perſons, as incurable and paſt all remedy. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>There are many of whom I have told you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and now tell you, even weeping, that they are enemies to the Croſs of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43767:97"/>
Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is in their ſhame.</hi> Such Perſons who <hi>glory</hi> in that which ought to be <hi>their ſhame,</hi> what can their <hi>end</hi> be but <hi>deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is certainly no greater ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a degenerate Perſon, and of one that is utterly loſt to all ſenſe of goodneſs, than to be void of ſhame; and as on the one Hand, they muſt be very towardly, and well diſpoſs'd to Virtue, who are drawn by inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, and meer ſenſe of Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Kindneſs; ſo on the other hand, they muſt be very ſtupid and inſenſible, who are not wrought upon by Arguments of fear, and ſenſe of ſhame. There is hardly any hopes of that Man, who is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from an Evil courſe, neither by the apprehenſion of danger, nor of diſgrace, and who can at once ſecurely neglect both his Safety and Reputation.</p>
            <p>Hear how the Prophet repreſents the deplorable Caſe of ſuch Perſons, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.9. <hi>The ſhew of their countenance
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43767:98"/>
bears witneſs againſt them</hi>; in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> it is, <hi>The hardneſs of their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance doth teſtifie againſt them, and they declare their ſin, as Sodom, they hide it not. Wo unto their Souls, for they have rewarded evil to themſelves.</hi> When Men are once arrived to that pitch of Impiety, as to harden their Foreheads againſt all ſenſe and ſhew of Shame, and ſo as to be able to ſet a good face upon the fouleſt Matter in the World; <hi>wo unto them,</hi> becauſe their Caſe ſeems then to be deſperate, and paſt all hopes of Recovery. For who can hope, that a Man will forſake his Sins, when he is not ſo much as aſhamed of them? But yet one would think, that thoſe that are not aſhamed of their Impiety, ſhould be aſhamed of their Impudence, and ſhould at leaſt bluſh at this, that they can do the vileſt and the moſt ſhameful things in the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bluſhing.</p>
            <p>To conclude this whole Diſcourſe, let the Conſideration of the evil and ſhamefulneſs of Sin have this double effect upon us, to make us heartily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of the paſt Errors and Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43767:98"/>
of our Lives, and firmly reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do better for the future.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To be heartily aſhamed of the paſt Errors of our Lives. So often as we reflect upon the manifold and hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Provocations of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, which many of us have been guilty of in the long courſe of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Life, together with the heavy Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of our Sins, by all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that can render them abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and ſhameful, not only in the Eye of God and Men, but of our own Conſciences likewiſe; we have great reaſon to humble our ſelves before God, in a penitent acknowledgment of them, and every one of us to ſay with <hi>Job, Behold I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth, I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes</hi>; and with <hi>Ezra, O my God! I am aſhamed, and bluſh to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquities are increaſed over our heads, and our treſpaſs is grown up unto the heavens: And now, O my God, what ſhall we ſay after this? for we have forſaken thy commandments</hi>; and with holy <hi>Daniel, We have ſinned, and have
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43767:99"/>
committed iniquity, and have done wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly; O Lord! Righteouſneſs belongeth unto thee, but unto us confuſion of face.</hi> Thus we ſhould reproach and upbraid our ſelves, in the Preſence of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, whom we have ſo often and ſo higly offended, and againſt whom we have done as evil things as we could, and ſay with the prodigal Son in the Parable; <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we would thus take ſhame to our ſelves, and humble our ſelves before God, he would <hi>be merciful to us miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sinners</hi>; he would <hi>take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly</hi>; and ſo ſoon as ever he ſaw us coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, would meet us with joy, and embrace us in the Arms of his Mercy. And then,</p>
            <p n="2">II. As we ſhould be heartily aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the paſt Errours and Miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our Lives, ſo we ſhould firmly reſolve, by God's Grace, to do better for the future; never to conſent to Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or to do any thing which we are convinc'd is contrary to our Duty,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43767:99"/>
and which will be matter of Shame to us, when we come to look back upon it, and make our Blood to riſe in our Faces at the mention or intimation of it, which will make us to ſneak, and <hi>hang down our heads,</hi> when we are twitted and upbraided with it, and which, if it be not prevented by a timely Humiliation and Repentance, will fill us with Horror and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with Shame and Confuſion of Face, both at the Hour of Death, and in the Day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>So that when we look into our Lives, and examine the Actions of them, when we conſider what we have done, and what our Doings have deſerved, we ſhould, in a due ſenſe of the great and manifold Miſcarriages of our Lives, and from a deep Sorrow and Shame and Deteſtation of our ſelves for them, I ſay, we ſhould, with that true Penitent deſcribed in <hi>Job,</hi> take Words to our ſelves, and ſay, <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I will not offend any more; That which I know not, teach thou me; and if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> And thus I have done with the <hi>ſecond</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43767:100"/>
of a ſinful and vicious Courſe of Life, <hi>viz.</hi> that the reflection upon it afterwards cauſeth Shame; <hi>What fruit had you then in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi>

            <p>THESE words are a Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon between an Holy and Virtuous and a Sinful and Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Courſe of Life, and ſet before us
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43767:101"/>
the manifeſt Inconveniences of the one,<note place="margin">Vol. 8.</note> and the manifold Advantages of the other. I have enter'd into a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> The manifeſt Inconveniences of a ſinful and vicious Courſe: And the Text mentions theſe <hi>three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. That it is Unprofitable.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That the reflection upon it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards is matter of Shame. Theſe <hi>Two</hi> I have ſpoken largely to. I ſhall now proceed to the</p>
            <p n="3">III. And <hi>laſt</hi> Inconvenience, which the Text mentions, of a ſinful and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Courſe of Life, <hi>viz.</hi> That the final Iſſue and Conſequence of theſe things is very diſmal and miſerable; <hi>The end of thoſe things is Death.</hi> No Fruit then when ye did theſe things; ſhame now that you come to reflect upon them; and Miſery and Death at the laſt.</p>
            <p>There are indeed almoſt innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Conſiderations and Arguments to diſcourage and deter men from ſin; the Unreaſonableneſs of it in it ſelf; the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:43767:101"/>
Injuſtice and Diſloyalty, and Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of it in reſpect to God; the ill Example of it to others; the Cruelty of it to our ſelves; the Shame and Diſhonour that attends it; the Grief and Sorrow which it will coſt us, if ever we be brought to a due Senſe of it; the Trouble and Horror of a guilty Conſcience, that will perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally haunt us; but above all the miſerable Event and ſad Iſſue of a wicked Courſe of Life continued in, and finally unrepented of. The Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to ſin may be alluring enough, and look upon us with a ſmiling Countenance, and the Commiſſion may afford us a ſhort and imperfect Pleaſure: but the Remembrance of it will certainly be bitter, and the End of it miſerable.</p>
            <p>And this Conſideration is of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the moſt apt to work upon the generality of men, eſpecially upon the more obſtinate and obdurate ſort of ſinners, and thoſe whom no other Arguments will penetrate; that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the preſent Pleaſure and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſin may be, it will be Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Miſery in the end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:43767:102"/>The two former Inconvenieces of a ſinful Courſe, which I have lately diſcourſed of, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſin is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitabte, and that it is Shameful, are very conſiderable, and ought to be great Arguments againſt it to every ſinner, and conſiderate Man: and yet how light are they, and but as the very ſmall duſt upon the balance, in compariſon of that inſupportable weight of Miſery which will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſinner at laſt! <hi>Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of Man that doth evil.</hi> This, this is the ſting of all, that <hi>the end of theſe things is death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very uſual in Scripture to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the greateſt Happineſs, and the greateſt Miſery, by Life and Death; Life being the firſt and moſt deſirable of all other Bleſſings, becauſe it is the Foundation of them, and that which makes us capable of all the reſt. Hence we find in Scripture, that all the Bleſſings of the Goſpel are ſumm'd up in this one word, <hi>John</hi> 20.31. <hi>Theſe things are written, that you might believe that Jeſus is the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:43767:102"/>
Chriſt, the Son of God, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ye might have Life through his Name.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.9. <hi>In this was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the love of God towards us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live through him.</hi> So that under this Term or Notion of Life, the Scripture is wont to expreſs all happineſs to us, and more eſpecially that eternal Life which is the great Promiſe of the Goſpel. And this is Life by wa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Eminency; as if this frail and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and miſerable Life, which we live here in this World, did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Name.</p>
            <p>And on the other Hand, all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils which are conſequent upon ſin, eſpecially the dreadful and laſting Miſery of another World, are called by the Name of Death, <hi>The end of theſe things is Death.</hi> So the Apoſtle, here in the Text, and 23. v. <hi>The wages of ſin is Death,</hi> not only a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Death, but ſuch a Death as is oppoſed to Eternal Life; <hi>The wages of ſin is Death: but the gift of God is Eternal Life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> So that <hi>Death</hi> here in the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43767:103"/>
Text is plainly intended to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in it all thoſe fearful and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Miſeries, wherewith the wrath of God will purſue and afflict ſinners in another World.</p>
            <p>But what and how great this Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is, I am not able to declare to you; <hi>it hath</hi> no more <hi>enter'd into the heart of man,</hi> than thoſe great and glorious things which <hi>God hath laid up for them that love him</hi>: and as I would fain hope, that none of us here ſhall ever have the ſad experience of it; ſo none but thoſe who have felt it, are able to give a tolerable deſcription of the intolerableneſs of it.</p>
            <p>But by what the Scripture hath ſaid of it in general, and in ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors as are moſt level to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Capacity, it appears ſo full of Terror, that I am loth to attempt the Repreſentation of it. There are ſo many other Arguments, that are more Humane and Natural, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to work upon the Reaſon and Ingenuity of Men; as the great Love and Kindneſs of God to us; the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sufferings of his Son for us; the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43767:103"/>
Unreaſonableneſs and Shamefulneſs of ſin; the preſent Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the Peace and Pleaſure of an Holy and Virtuous Life; and the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Rewards promiſed to it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, that one would think theſe ſhould be abundantly ſufficient to prevail with men to gain them to goodneſs, and that they need not be frighted into it, and to have the Law laid to them, as it was once given to the People of <hi>Iſrael, in thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lightning, in blackneſs, in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tempeſt,</hi> ſo as to make them <hi>exceedinly to fear and tremble.</hi> And it ſeems a very hard Caſe, that when we have to deal with men, ſenſible enough of their Intereſt in other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and diligent enough to mind it, we cannot perſwade them to accept of Happineſs, without ſetting before them the Terrors of Eternal Darkneſs, and thoſe amazing and endleſs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, which will certainly be the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe who refuſe ſo great an Happineſs; this I ſay ſeems very hard, that men muſt be carried to the Gate of Hell, before they can be brought to ſet their faces towards Heaven, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43767:104"/>
to think in good earneſt of getting thither.</p>
            <p>And yet it cannot be diſſembled, that the Nature of men is ſo degenerate, as to ſtand in need of this Argument; and that men are ſo far engaged in an Evil Courſe, that they are not to be reclaimed from it by any other Conſideration, but of the endleſs and unſpeakable Miſery of impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in another World. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, knowing how neceſſary this is, doth frequently make uſe of it; and our Bleſſed Saviour, than whom none was ever more mild and gentle, doth often ſet this Conſideration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men to take them off from ſin, and to bring them to do better. And this St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. is one principal thing which renders the Goſpel ſo powerful an Inſtrument for the reforming and ſaving of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, becauſe <hi>therein the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, againſt all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that how harſh and unpleaſant ſoever this Argument may be, the great ſtupidity and folly of ſome
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43767:104"/>
men, and their inveterate obſtinacy in an Evil Courſe makes it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us to preſs it home, that thoſe who will not be moved, and made ſenſible of the danger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of ſin by gentler Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may be rous'd and awakened by the Terrors of Eternal Miſery.</p>
            <p>That the laſt Iſſue and Conſequence of a wicked Life will be very Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, the general Apprehenſion of Mankind concerning the fate of bad men in another World, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret miſgivings of mens Conſciences, gives men too much ground to fear. Beſides that the Juſtice of Divine Providence, which is not many times in this World ſo clear and manifeſt, does ſeem to require that there ſhould be a time of Recompence, when the Virtue and Patience of good men ſhould be Rewarded, and the Inſolence and Obſtinacy of bad men ſhould be Puniſh'd. This cannot but appear very reaſonable to any Man, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the Nature of God, and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he governs the World, and hath given Laws to Mankind, by the obſervance whereof they may be
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43767:105"/>
Happy, and by the neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt whereof they muſt be Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>But that there might remain no doubts upon the Minds of men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe matters, God hath been pleas'd to reveal this from Heaven, by a Perſon ſent by him on purpoſe to declare it to the World; and to the truth of theſe Doctrines concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a future ſtate and a day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Recompences, God hath given Teſtimony by unqueſtionable Miracles wrought for the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, and particularly by <hi>the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead, whereby he hath given an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance unto all men, that he is</hi> the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>ordained by God to Judge the World in righteouſneſs, and to render to every Man according to his deeds; to them, who by patient continuance in well doing ſeek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal Life; but to them, who obey not the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of Man that doth evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:43767:105"/>So that how quietly ſoever wicked Men may paſs through this World, or out of it, (which they ſeldom do) Miſery will certainly overtake their Sins at laſt; unſpeakable and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Miſery, ariſing from the anguiſh of a guilty Conſcience; from a lively Apprehenſion of their ſad Loſs; and from a quick ſenſe of the ſharp Pain which they labour under; and all this aggravated and ſet off with the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of paſt Pleaſure, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of future Eaſe. Each of theſe is Miſery enough, and all of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether do conſtitute and make up that diſmal and forlorn State, which the Scripture calls Hell and Damnation.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore briefly repreſent (for it is by no means deſirable to dwell long upon ſo melancholy and frightful an Argument,)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The principal Ingredients which conſtitute this miſerable State. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Aggravations of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:43767:106"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The principal Ingredients which conſtitute this miſerale State; and they are theſe <hi>three</hi> which I have mentioned.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Anguiſh of a guilty Mind.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The lively Apprehenſions of the invaluable Happineſs which they have loſt.</p>
            <p n="3">III. A quick Senſe of the intolerable Pains which they lie under.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Anguiſh of a guilty Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And this is natural; for there is a Worm that abides in a guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and is continually gnawing it. This is that our Saviour calls <hi>the Worm that dyes not.</hi> And tho' God ſhould inflict no poſitive Puniſhment upon Sinners, yet this is a Revenge which every Man's Mind would take upon him; for things are ſo order'd by God in the original Frame and Conſtitution of our Minds, that on the one hand Peace and Pleaſure, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and Satisfaction do natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſe in our Minds from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:43767:106"/>
of Well-doing, and ſpring up in the Soul of every good Man: And on the other hand, no Man knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does an evil Action, but his guilty Conſcience galls him for it, and the remembrance of it is full of Bitterneſs to him.</p>
            <p>And this the Sinner feels in this World; he diſguiſeth and diſſembleth his Trouble as much as he can, and ſhifts off theſe uneaſie Thoughts by all the Diverſions he can deviſe, and by this means palliates his Diſeaſe, and renders his Condition in ſome ſort tolerable unto himſelf: but when he is alone, or caſt upon the Bed of Sickneſs, and his Thoughts are let looſe upon him, and he hath nothing to give them a Diverſion, how does his Guilt ferment and work! and the Feaver, which lurkt before, does now ſhew it ſelf, and is ready to burn him up; ſo that nothing can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more diſmal and ghaſtly, than ſuch a Man does to himſelf.</p>
            <p>And much more, when Sinners come into the other World, and are entred into the Regions of Darkneſs,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43767:107"/>
and the melancholy Shades, where Evil Spirits are continually wandring up and down; where they can meet with nothing either of Employment or Pleaſure, to give the leaſt Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their penſive Minds; where they ſhall find nothing to do, but to reflect upon, and bemoan themſelves; where all the wicked Actions that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they committed ſhall come freſh into their Minds, and ſtare their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in the face. It is not to be imagined, what ſad Scenes will then be preſent to their Imaginations, and what ſharp Reflections their own guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Minds will make upon them, and what Swarms of Furies will poſſeſs them.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as ever they are entered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that State, they will then find themſelves forſaken of all thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which they once placed ſo much Happineſs in; and they will have nothing to converſe with, but their own uneaſie ſelves, and thoſe that are as miſerable as themſelves, and therefore uncapable of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring any Comfort to one another. They will then have nothing to think
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43767:107"/>
on, but what will trouble them; and every new Thought will be a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their Trouble. Their Guilt will make them reſtleſs, and the more reſtleſs they are, the more will their Minds be enraged; and there will be no end of their Vexation, becauſe the Cauſe and Ground of it is perpetual. For there is no poſſible way to get rid of Guilt, but by Repentance; and there is no Encouragment, no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Repentance, where there is no hope of Pardon. So that if God ſhould hold his Hand, and leave Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to themſelves, and to the Laſhes of their own Conſcience, a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and terrible Torment can hardly be imagin'd, than that which a guilty Mind would execute upon it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Another Ingredient into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of Sinners in another World, is the lively Apprehenſion of the invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Happineſs which they have loſt by their own Obſtinacy and fooliſh Choice. In the next World wicked Men ſhall be for ever ſeparated from God, who is the Fountain of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and from all the Comforts of his Preſence and Favour. This, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:43767:108"/>
tells us, is the firſt part of that dreadful Sentence that ſhall be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the wicked at the great Day; <hi>Depart from me</hi>; which Words, tho' they do not ſignifie any poſitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and Torment, yet they import the greateſt Loſs that can be imagined. And it is not ſo eaſie to determine which is the greateſt of Evils, Loſs or Pain. Indeed to a Creature that is only endowed with Senſe, there can be no Miſery but that of Pain and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering: but to thoſe who have Reaſon and Underſtanding, and are capable of knowing the value of things, and of reflecting upon themſelves in the want of them, the greateſt loſs may be as grievous and hard to be born, as the greateſt pain.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that ſinners are now ſo immerſt in the groſs and ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of this World, that they have no apprehenſion of the Joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Pleaſures of God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and of the Happineſs that is to be enjoyed in Communion with him, and therefore they are not now ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of eſtimating the greatneſs of this loſs. But this inſenſibleneſs of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43767:108"/>
wicked men continues no longer than this preſent ſtate, which affords them variety of Objects of Pleaſure and of Buſineſs to divert them and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them: but when they come into the other World, they ſhall then have nothing elſe to think upon, but the ſad Condition into which they have brought themſelves, nothing to do but to pore and meditate upon their own Misfortune, when they ſhall lift up their Eyes, and with <hi>the rich Man</hi> in the Parable, in the midſt of their <hi>Torments,</hi> look up to thoſe who are <hi>in Abraham</hi>'s <hi>boſom</hi>; and their Miſery will be mightily increaſed by the Contemplation of that Happineſs which others enjoy, and themſelves have ſo fooliſhly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited and fallen ſhort of; inſomuch that it would be happy for them, if that God, from whoſe preſence they are baniſht, that Heaven from which they have excluded themſelves, and that everlaſting Glory, which they have deſpiſed and neglected, might be for ever hid from their Eyes, and never come into their Minds.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:43767:109"/>III. This is not all, but beſides the ſad Apprehenſion of their Loſs, they ſhall endure the ſharpeſt Pains. Theſe God hath threatned ſinners withal, and they are in Scripture repreſented to us, by the moſt grievous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Pains that in this World we are acquainted withal, as by the Pain of Burning. Hence the wicked are ſaid <hi>to be caſt into the Lake, which burns with fire and brimſtone,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire which is not quenched</hi>; which whether it be literally to be underſtood or not, is certainly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſignifie the moſt ſevere kind of Torment; but what that is, and in what manner it ſhall be inflicted, none know but they that feel it, and lie under it. The Scripture tells ſo much in general of it, as is enough to warn men to avoid it; that it is the effect of a mighty Diſpleaſure, and of Anger armed with Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and conſequently muſt needs be very terrible, more dreadful than we can now conceive, and probably greater than can be deſcribed by any of thoſe Pains and Sufferings which now we are acquainted withal; for
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:43767:109"/>
               <hi>who knows the power of God's anger,</hi> and the utmoſt of what Almighty Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice can do to Sinners? Who can Comprehend the vaſt ſignificancy of thoſe Expreſſions, <hi>Fear him, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath killed, can deſtroy both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul in Hell</hi>? and again, <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God</hi>? One would think this were Miſery enough, and needed no farther Aggravation; and yet it hath <hi>Two</hi> terrible ones, from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of paſt Pleaſures which Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have enjoyed in this World, and from an utter Deſpair of future Eaſe and Remedy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Conſideration of the paſt Pleaſures which Sinners have enjoy'd in this Life. This will make their Sufferings much more ſharp and ſenſible; for as nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Pleaſure more, and gives Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs a quicker taſte and reliſh, than precedent Sufferings and Pain, there is not perhaps a greater Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the World, than the ſtrange and ſudden Eaſe which a Man finds after a ſharp fit of the Stone or Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, or after a Man is taken off the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:43767:110"/>
Rack, and Nature which was in an Agony before is all at once ſet at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Eaſe: So on the other Hand, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing exaſperates Suffering more, and ſets a keener Edge upon Miſery, than to ſtep into Afflictions and Pain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately out of a ſtate of great Eaſe and Pleaſure. This we find in the Parable was the great Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the rich Man's Torment, that he had firſt <hi>received his good things,</hi> and was afterwards <hi>Tormented.</hi> We may do well to conſider this, that thoſe Pleaſures of Sin which have now ſo much of Temptation in them, will in the next World be one of the chief Aggravations of our Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The greateſt Aggravation of this Miſery will be, that it is attended with the Deſpair of any future Eaſe; and when Miſery and Deſpair meet together, they make a Man compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſerable. The duration of this Miſery is expreſt to us in Scripture, by ſuch words as are us'd to ſignifie the longeſt and moſt interminable durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire.</hi> Matt. 25.41. <hi>Where the worm
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:43767:110"/>
dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</hi> Mark. 9.43. <hi>and</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.7. It is there ſaid, that thoſe <hi>who know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of his Son, ſhall be puniſht with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.10. That <hi>the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</hi> And what can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined beyond this? This is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Miſery, to lie under the greateſt Torment, and yet be in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of ever finding the leaſt Eaſe.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the <hi>Firſt</hi> thing I propounded to ſpeak to from this Text, <hi>viz.</hi> The manifeſt Inconveniences of a ſinful and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Courſe of Life; that it brings no preſent Benefit or Advantage to us; that the reflection upon it cauſeth Shame; and that it is fearful and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable in the laſt Iſſue and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it. <hi>What fruit had you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now have proceeded to the <hi>Second</hi> Part of the Text, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents to us the manifold Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of an Holy and Virtuous Courſe
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:43767:111"/>
of Life; 22.v. <hi>But now being made free from ſin, and become the ſervants of righteouſneſs, ye have your fruit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to holineſs,</hi> there's the preſent Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it; <hi>and the end everlaſting life,</hi> there's the future Reward of it. But this is a large Argument, which will require a Diſcourſe by it ſelf, and therefore I ſhall not now enter upon it; but ſhall only make ſome reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon what hath been ſaid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the miſerable Iſſue and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a wicked Life impenitently perſiſted in.</p>
            <p>And ſurely, if we firmly believe and ſeriouſly conſider theſe things, we have no reaſon to be fond of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Vice; we can take no great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or Contentment in a ſinful Courſe. If we could for the ſeeming Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and ſhort Pleaſure of ſome ſins, diſpenſe with the Temporal Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and Inconveniences of them, which yet I cannot ſee how any Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Conſiderate Man could do; if we could conquer Shame, and bear the Infamy and Reproach which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends moſt ſins, and could digeſt the upbraidings of our own Conſciences,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:43767:111"/>
ſo often as we call them to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and reflect ſeriouſly upon them; tho' for the gratifying an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Inclination, and an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Appetite, all the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them might be born withal; yet methinks the very thought of the End and Iſſue of a wicked Life, that <hi>the end of theſe things is Death,</hi> that <hi>indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh,</hi> far greater than we can now deſcribe or imagine, <hi>ſhall be to every ſoul of Man that doth evil,</hi> ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rule us. Tho' the violence of an irregular luſt and deſire are able to bear down all other Arguments, yet methinks the Eternal Intereſt of our precious and immortal Souls ſhould ſtill lie near our Hearts, and affect us very ſenſibly. Methinks the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of another World, and of all Eternity, and of that diſmal fate which attends Impenitent Sinners af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Life, and the dreadful ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being miſerable for ever, ſhould be more than enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten any Man from a wicked life, and to bring him to a better Mind and Courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:43767:112"/>And if the plain Repreſentations of theſe things do not prevail with men to this purpoſe, it is a ſign that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not believe theſe things, or elſe that they do not conſider them, one of theſe two muſt be the reaſon why any Man, notwithſtanding theſe terrible threatnings of God's Word, does venture to continue in an Evil Courſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis vehemently to be ſuſpected, that men do not really believe theſe things, that they are not fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that there is another ſtate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Life, in which the righteous God <hi>will render to every Man according to his deeds</hi>; and therefore ſo much Wickedneſs as we ſee in the lives of men, ſo much Infidelity may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be ſuſpected to lie lurking in their Hearts. They may indeed ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly profeſs to believe theſe things; but he that would know what a Man inwardly and firmly believes, ſhould attend rather to his Actions, than to his Verbal Profeſſions: For if any Man lives ſo, as no Man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Principles of the Chriſtian
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:43767:112"/>
Religion in reaſon can live, there is too much reaſon to queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Man doth believe his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; he may ſay he does, but there is a far greater Evidence in the Caſe than Words; the Actions of the Man are by far the moſt credible Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the inward Senſe and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of his Mind.</p>
            <p>Did men firmly and heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is a God that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the World, and regards the Actions of men, and that <hi>he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day in which he will judge the World in righteouſneſs,</hi> and that all Mankind ſhall appear before him in that day, and every Action that they have done in their whole lives ſhall be brought upon the Stage, and paſs a ſtrict Examination and Cenſure, and that thoſe who have made Conſcience of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God and men, and have <hi>liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World,</hi> ſhall be unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and eternally Happy in the next; but thoſe who have lived lewd, and licentious lives, and perſiſted in an Impenitent Courſe, ſhall be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:43767:113"/>
and everlaſtingly miſerable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pity, and without Comfort, and without Remedy, and without Hope of ever being otherwiſe; I ſay, if men were fully and firmly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of theſe things, it is not Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, it is hardly Poſſible that they ſhould live ſuch Prophane and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, ſuch Careleſs and Diſſolute Lives, as we daily ſee a great part of Mankind do.</p>
            <p>That Man that can be aw'd from his Duty, or tempted to Sin by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Pleaſures or Terrors of this World, that for the preſent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Luſts can be contented to venture his Soul, what greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence than this can there be, that this Man does not believe the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Goſpel, and how <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> That Man that can be willing to undergo an hard Service for ſeveral years, that he may be in a way to get an Eſtate, and be rich in this World; and yet will not be perſwaded to reſtrain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his Liberty, or to deny his Pleaſure, or to check his Appetite
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:43767:113"/>
or Luſt, for the greateſt Reward that God can promiſe, or the ſevereſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that he can threaten; can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man reaſonably think, that this Man is perſwaded of any ſuch Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Miſery after this Life, as is plainly revealed in the Goſpel, that <hi>verily there is a reward for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and verily there is a God that judgeth the Earth?</hi> For what can he that believes not one ſyllable of the Bible, do worſe than this comes to?</p>
            <p>A ſtrong and vigorous Faith, even in Temporal Caſes, is a powerful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Action, eſpecially if it be back'd and enforc'd with Arguments of fear. He that believes the reality of a thing, and that it is good for him, and that it may be attained, and that if he do attain it, it will make him very happy, and that without it he ſhall be extreamly miſerable; ſuch a Belief and Perſwaſion will put a Man upon difficult things, and make him to put forth a vigorous endeavour, and to uſe a mighty induſtry for the obtaining of that, concerning which he is thus perſwaded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:43767:114"/>And the Faith of the Goſpel ought to be ſo much the more powerful, by how much the Objects of hope and fear, which it preſents to us, are greater and more conſiderable. Did men fully believe the Happineſs of Heaven, and the Torments of Hell, and were they as verily perſwaded of the truth of them, as if they were before their Eyes, how inſignificant would all the Terrors and Temptations of Senſe be to draw them into Sin, and ſeduce them from their Duty.</p>
            <p>But altho' it ſeems very ſtrange, and almoſt incredible, that men ſhould believe theſe things, and yet live wicked and impious lives; yet becauſe I have no Mind, and God knows there's no need to increaſe the number of Infidels in this Age, I ſhall chuſe rather to impute a great deal of the wickedneſs that is in the World, to the Inconſiderateneſs of men, than to their Unbelief. I will grant that they do in ſome ſort believe theſe things, or at leaſt that they do not disbelieve them; and then the great cauſe of mens ruin muſt be, that they
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:43767:114"/>
do not attend to the Conſequence of this Belief, and how men ought to live that are thus perſwaded. Men ſtifle their Reaſon, and ſuffer themſelves to be hurried away by Senſe, into the embraces of ſenſual Objects and things preſent, but do not conſider what the end of theſe things will be, and what is like to become of them hereafter; for it is not to be imagined, but that that Man who ſhall calmly conſider with himſelf what Sin is, the ſhortneſs of its Pleaſure, and the Eternity of its Puniſhment, ſhould ſeriouſly reſolve upon a better Courſe of life.</p>
            <p>And why do we not Conſider theſe things, which are of ſo infinite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to us? What have we our Reaſon for, but to reflect upon our ſelves, and to mind what we do, and wiſely to compare things together, and upon the whole matter to judge what makes moſt for our true and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Intereſt? to Conſider our whole ſelves, our Souls as well as our Bodies; and our whole duration not only in this World, but in the other, not only with regard to Time, but to Eternity? to look before us to the laſt
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43767:115"/>
Iſſue and Event of our Actions, and to the fartheſt Conſequence of them, and to reckon upon what will be hereafter, as well as what is preſent; and if we ſuſpect or hope or fear, eſpecially if we have good reaſon to believe a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate after Death, in which we ſhall be happy or miſerable to all Eternity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we manage and behave our ſelves in this World, to reſolve to make it our greateſt Deſign and Concernment while we are in this World, ſo to live and demean our ſelves, that we may be of the number of thoſe that ſhall be accounted worthy to eſcape that Miſery, and to obtain that happineſs, which will laſt and continue for ever.</p>
            <p>And if men, would but apply their Minds ſeriouſly to the Conſideration of theſe things, they could not act ſo imprudently as they do, they would not live ſo by chance and without deſign, taking the Pleaſure that comes next, and avoiding the preſent Evils which preſs upon them, without any regard to thoſe that are future, and at a diſtance, tho' they be infinitely greater and more conſiderable: If men could have the Patience to debate and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:43767:115"/>
argue theſe matters with themſelves, they could not live ſo prepoſterouſly as they do, preferring their Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Souls, and the World before God, and the things which are Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral before the things that are Eternal.</p>
            <p>Did men verily and in good earneſt believe but half of that to be true, which hath now been declared to you, concerning the miſerable ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinners in another World, (and I am very ſure, that the one half of that which is true concerning that ſtate hath not been told you) I ſay did we in any meaſure believe what hath been ſo imperfectly repreſented, <hi>What manner of perſons ſhould we all be, in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſation and godlineſs, waiting for, and haſtening unto</hi> (that is making haſte to make the beſt preparation we could for) <hi>the coming of the day of God</hi>!</p>
            <p>I will conclude all with our Saviour's Exhortation to his Diſciples, and to all others; <hi>Watch ye therefore and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to eſcape all theſe things, and to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son of Man: To whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be all honour and glory, world without end.</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <p>What fruit had ye then in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed? For the end of thoſe things is death. But now being made free from ſin, and become Servants to God, ye have your fruit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Holineſs, and the end Everlaſting Life.</p>

            <p>I Have ſeveral times told you, that the Apoſtle in theſe words makes a Compariſon between an Holy and Virtuous, and a Sinful and Vicious
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:43767:117"/>
Courſe of Life,<note place="margin">Vol. 8.</note> and ſets before us the manifeſt Inconveniences of the one, and the manifold Advantages of the other.</p>
            <p>I have finiſh'd my Diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Firſt</hi> Part of the Compariſon; the manifeſt Inconveniences of a ſinful and vicious Courſe. I proceed now to the other Part of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, which was the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Thing I propounded to ſpeak to from theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> the manifold Benefits and Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of an Holy and Virtuous Courſe; and that upon theſe <hi>Two</hi> accounts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of the preſent Benefit and Advantage of it, which the Apoſtle here calls <hi>Fruit, Ye have your fruit unto holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In reſpect of the future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, <hi>and the end everlaſting life.</hi> So that here is a conſiderable Earneſt in hand, beſides a mighty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence afterwards, infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the proportion of our beſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Services, both in regard of the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:43767:117"/>
greatneſs and duration of it, <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life</hi>; that is, for a few tranſient acts of Obedience, a perfect and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable and endleſs ſtate of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And theſe <hi>Two</hi> the Apoſtle mentions in Oppoſition to the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and Evil Conſequences of a wicked and vicious Courſe; <hi>What fruit had you then in thoſe things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But before I come to ſpeak to theſe <hi>Two</hi> particulars, I ſhall take notice of the deſcription which the Apoſtle here makes, of the change from a ſtate of Sin and Vice to a ſtate of Holineſs and Virtue. <hi>But now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made free from ſin, and become the ſervants of God</hi>; intimating that the ſtate of ſin is a ſtate of Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Slavery, from which Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and the change which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made does ſet us free; <hi>but now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made free from ſin.</hi> And ſo our Saviour tells us, that <hi>whoſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſin is the Servant of ſin</hi>; and this is the vileſt and hardeſt Slavery in the World, becauſe it is the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Soul, the beſt and nobleſt part of our ſelves; 'tis the ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Reaſon, which ought to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:43767:118"/>
rule and bear Sway over the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Faculties, to our ſenſual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and brutiſh Paſſions, which is as uncomely a ſight, as <hi>to ſee Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars ride on Horſe back, and Princes walk on foot</hi>; and as Inferiour Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when they are advanced to Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, are ſtrangely Inſolent and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical towards thoſe that are ſubject to them; ſo the Luſts and Paſſions of men, when they once get the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of them, are the moſt domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering Tyrants in the World, and there is no ſuch Slave as a Man that is ſubject to his Appetite and Luſt, that is under the Power of irregular Paſſions and vicious Inclinations, which tranſport and hurry him to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and moſt unreaſonable things. For a wicked Man is a Slave to as many Maſters as he hath Paſſions and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and they are very imperious and exacting, and the more he yields to them, the more they grow upon him, and exerciſe the greater Tyranny o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him; and being ſubject to ſo many Maſters, the poor Slave is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually divided and diſtracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their contrary Commands and Impoſitions; one Paſſion hurries him
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:43767:118"/>
one way, and another as violently drives him another; one Luſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him upon ſuch a Service, and another it may be at the ſame time calls him to another Work. His Pride and Ambition bids him ſpend and lay it out, whilſt his Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs holds his Hand faſt cloſed; ſo that he knows not many times how to diſpoſe of himſelf or what to do, he muſt diſpleaſe ſome of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and what Inclination ſoever he contradicts, he certainly diſpleaſeth himſelf.</p>
            <p>And that which aggravates the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of his Condition is, that he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſubmits to this Servitude. In other Caſes men are made Slaves againſt their wills, and are brought under the Force and Power of others, whom they are not able to reſiſt: but the ſinner chuſeth this Servitude, and willingly puts his neck under this yoke. There are few men in the World ſo ſick of their Liberty, and ſo weary of their own Happineſs, as to chuſe this Condition: but the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſells himſelf, and voluntarily parts with that Liberty, which he
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:43767:119"/>
might keep, and which none could take from him.</p>
            <p>And which makes this Condition yet more intolerable, he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Slave to his own Servants, to thoſe who are born to be ſubject to him, to his own Appetites and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and this certainly is the worſt kind of Slavery, ſo much worſe than that of Mines and Gallies, as the Soul is more Noble and Excellent than the Body.</p>
            <p>Men are not uſually ſo ſenſible of the Miſery of this kind of Servitude, becauſe they are govern'd by Senſe more than Reaſon: But according to a true Judgment and Eſtimation of things, a Vicious Courſe Life is the ſaddeſt Slavery of all others. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel repreſents it as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign every way worthy of the Son of God, to come down from Heaven, and to debaſe himſelf ſo far, as to aſſume our Nature, and to ſubmit to the Death of the Croſs, on purpoſe to reſcue us from this Slavery, and to aſſert us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>the liberty of the Sons of God.</hi> And this is the great deſign of the Doctrine
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:43767:119"/>
of the Goſpel, to free men from the Bondage of their Luſts, and to bring them to the Service of God, <hi>whoſe ſervice is perfect freedom.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour tells us, <hi>John</hi> 8.31, 32. That <hi>if we continue in his word,</hi> i. e. if we obey his Doctrine, and frame our lives according to it, it will make us free; <hi>Ye ſhall know</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free.</hi> And if we obſerve it, the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights very much to ſet forth to us the Benefits and Advantages of the Chriſtian Religion by the Metaphor of Liberty, and Redemption from Captivity and Slavery. Hence our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is ſo often call'd <hi>the Redeemer,</hi> and <hi>Deliverer,</hi> and is ſaid to have <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained eternal Redemption for us.</hi> And the publiſhing of the Goſpel is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Proclaming of the year of <hi>Jubile</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> when all Perſons that would were ſet at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord is upon me,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, ſpeaking in the Perſon of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, <hi>becauſe he hath anointed me to Proclaim liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:43767:120"/>
of the Lord.</hi> And it is probable that upon this account likewiſe the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine or Law is by St. <hi>James</hi> call'd <hi>the Royal law of liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the great deſign of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, to ſet men free from the Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their Luſts, and to this end the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13. that <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works</hi>; and herein the great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Compaſſion of God towards Mankind appeared, in that he ſent his Son to reſcue us from that Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which we had ſo long groaned under, <hi>that being made free from ſin, we might become the ſervants of God,</hi> and <hi>the ſervants of righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this he hath done not only by the price of his Blood, but by the Power and Purity of his Doctrine, and the Holy Example of his Life, and by all thoſe Conſiderations which repreſent to us the Miſery of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtate, and the infinite danger of continuing in it: and on the other Hand, by ſetting before us the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:43767:120"/>
of a Religious and Holy Life, and what a bleſſed change we make, when we quit the Service of Sin, and become the Servants of God. It will not only be a mighty preſent Benefit to us; but will make us happy to all Eternity; and theſe are the <hi>Two</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations which at firſt I propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſpeak to at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The preſent Benefit of an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Virtuous Life, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here calls <hi>Fruit; But now being made free from ſin, and become the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, ye have your fruit unto holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The future Reward and Recompence of it; <hi>and the end ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let us conſider the preſent Benefit and Advantage of an Holy and Virtuous Life, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here calls <hi>Fruit.</hi> If all things be truly conſider'd, there is no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage comes to any Man by a wicked and vicious Courſe of Life. A wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Life is no preſent Advantage; the reflection upon it afterwards is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:43767:121"/>
ſhameful and troubleſom; and the end of it miſerable. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Advantages of an holy and good life are many and great even in this World, and upon temporal accounts, abſtracting from the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of a future Reward in the World to come.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſtance in <hi>Five</hi> or <hi>Six</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Advantages, which it uſually brings to men in this World.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It brings great Peace and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mind.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is a very fit and proper Means to promote our outward temporal Intereſt.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It tends to the lengthning our days, and hath frequently the Bleſſing of long Life attending upon it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. It gives a Man great Peace and Comfort when he comes to die.</p>
            <p n="5">V. After Death it tranſmits a good Name and Reputation to Poſterity.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:43767:121"/>VI. It derives a Bleſſing upon our Poſterity after us. And theſe are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the greateſt Bleſſings that a wiſe Man can aim at, and deſign to himſelf in this World. Every one of theſe taken ſeverally is very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; but all of them together com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat a Man's temporal Felicity, and raiſe it to as high a pitch as is to be expected in this World.</p>
            <p n="1">I. A Religious and Virtuous courſe of Life is the beſt way to Peace and Contentment of Mind, and does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly bring it. And to a wiſe Man, that knows how to value the eaſe and ſatisfaction of his own Mind, there cannot be a greater temptation to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Virtue, than to conſider that it is the beſt and only way to give reſt to his Mind. And this is preſent <hi>Fruit</hi> and ready Payment; becauſe it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follows, or rather accompanies the diſcharge of our Duty. <hi>The fruit of righteouſneſs is peace,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; and the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>the peaceable fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> meaning that inward Peace
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:43767:122"/>
which a Righteous Man hath in his own Mind.</p>
            <p>A Man needs not to take pains, or to uſe many Arguments, to ſatisfie and content his own Mind, after he hath done a good Action, and to convince himſelf, that he hath no cauſe to be troubled for it; for Peace and Pleaſure do naturally ſpring from it: Nay, not only ſo, but there is an unexpreſſible kind of pleaſure and delight, that flows from the teſtimony of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Let but a Man take care to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf in the doing of his Duty, and whatever troubles and ſtorms may be raiſed from without, all will be clear and calm within: For nothing but guilt can trouble a Man's Mind, and fright his Conſcience, and make him uneaſie to himſelf; <hi>that</hi> indeed will wound his Spirit, and ſting his very Soul, and make him full of fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and tormenting thoughts. This <hi>Cain</hi> found after he had committed that crying ſin of Murdering his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.6. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto</hi> Cain, <hi>why art thou wrath? and why is thy Countenance fall'n?</hi> His guilt made him full of wrath, and diſcontent fill'd
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:43767:122"/>
his Mind with vexation, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance with ſhame and confuſion. When a Man's conſcience is awakened to a ſenſe of his guilt, it is angry and froward, and harder to be ſtill'd than a peeviſh Child: But the practice of Holineſs and Virtue does produce juſt the contrary effects; it fills a Man's Mind with Pleaſure, and makes his Countenance chearful.</p>
            <p>And this certainly, if it be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, is no ſmall and contemptible advantage. The peace and tranquillity of our Minds is the great thing, which all the Philoſophy and Wiſdom of the World, did always deſign to bring men to, as the very utmoſt happineſs that a Wiſe Man is capable of in this Life; and 'tis that which no conſiderate Man would part with, for all that this World can give him. The greateſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in this World ought to be no temptation to any Man in his Wits, to ſubmit to perpetual Sickneſs and Pain for the gaining of it; and yet there is no diſeaſe in the World, that for the ſharpneſs of it is comparable to the ſting of a guilty Mind, and no pleaſure equal to that of Innocence
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:43767:123"/>
and a good Conſcience. And this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſprings up in the Mind of a good Man, where it is not hindred ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a melancholy temper, or by falſe Principles in Religion, which fill a Man with groundleſs fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of the love and favour of God towards him; and excepting theſe two caſes, this is the ordinary fruit of an holy and good courſe, which is not interrupted by frequent falling into ſin, and great omiſſions and violations of our duty: For in this caſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions of our Peace and Comfort will naturally be anſwerable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of our Obedience.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Beſides the preſent and ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fruit of Holineſs, the quiet and ſatisfaction of our own Minds, it is likewiſe a proper means to promote our Intereſt and Happineſs in this World. For as every Vice is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attended with ſome Temporal Inconvenience of Pain or Loſs; ſo there is no Grace or Virtue, but does apparently conduce to a Man's tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Felicity. There are ſome Virtues which tend to the health of his Body, and the prolonging of his Life, as
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:43767:123"/>
Temperance and Chaſtity; others tend to Riches and Plenty, as Diligence and Induſtry in our callings; others to the ſecure and peaceable Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what we have, as Truth and Fidelity, Juſtice and Honeſty in all our dealings and intercourſe with men. There are other Virtues that are apt to oblige Mankind to us, and to gain their Friendſhip and good Will, their Aid and Aſſiſtance, as Kindneſs, and Meekneſs, and Charity, and a generous Diſpoſition to do good to all, as far as we have Power and Oportunity. In a word, there is no real Intereſt of this World, but may ordinarily be as effectually promoted and purſued to as great Advantage, by a Man that Exerciſes himſelf in the Practice of all Virtue and Goodneſs, and uſually to far greater Advantage, than by one that is Intemperate and Debauch'd, Deceitful and Diſhoneſt, apt to diſoblige and provoke, ſour and ill-natur'd to all Mankind: For there is none of theſe Vices, but is to a Man's real hinderance and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, in regard of one kind of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or another, which men aim at
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:43767:124"/>
and propoſe to themſelves in this World.</p>
            <p n="3">III. A Religious and Virtuous Courſe of Life doth naturally tend to the prolonging of our days, and hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequently the Bleſſing of Health and long Life attending upon it. The Practice of a great many Virtues is a great Preſervative of Life and Health, as the due government of our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Paſſions, by Temperance and Chaſtity and Meekneſs, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the chief Cauſes from within of Bodily Diſeaſes and Diſtempers; the due government of our Tongues and Converſation in reſpect of others, by Juſtice and Kindneſs, and abſtaining from Wrath and Provocation, which are a great ſecurity againſt the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of outward Violence, according to that of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.10. <hi>He that will love life and ſee good days, let him refrain his Tongue from evil, and his Lips that they ſpeak no guile, let him eſchew evil, and do good, let him ſeek peace and enſue it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſide the natural tendency of things, there is a ſpecial Bleſſing of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:43767:124"/>
God, which attends good men, and makes <hi>their days long in the land which the Lord their God hath given them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. There is nothing gives a Man ſo much Comfort when he comes to die, as the reflection upon an holy and good Life; and then ſurely above all other times Comfort is moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe our frail and infirm Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth then ſtand moſt in need of it. Then uſually mens Hearts are faint and their Spirits low, and every thing is apt to deject and trouble them; ſo that we had need to provide our ſelves of ſome excellent Cordial a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that time; and there is no Comfort like to that of a clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and of an innocent and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Life. This will revive and raiſe a Man's Spirits under all the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Body, becauſe it gives a Man good hopes concerning his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal State, and the hopes of that are apt to fill a Man with <hi>Joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and full of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The difference between good and bad Men is never ſo remarkable in
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:43767:125"/>
this World, as when they are upon their Death-Bed. This the Scripture obſerves to us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.37. <hi>Mark the perfect Man, and behold the upright, for the end of that Man is peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With what Triumph and Exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth the Bleſſed Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> upon the review of his Life, diſcourſe concerning his Death and Diſſolution? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. <hi>I am now ready,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to be offered up, and the time of my departure is at hand: I have fought a good fight, I have finiſh'd my courſe, I have kept the faith; hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the righteous Judge will give me at that day.</hi> What would not any of us do to be thus affected when we come to leave the World, and to be able to bear the thoughts of Death and Eternity with ſo quiet and well ſatisfi'd a Mind! why, let us but endeavour to live Holy lives, and to be uſeful and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to God in our Generation, as this holy Apoſtle was, and we ſhall have the ſame ground of Joy and Triumph which he had. For this is the proper and genuine effect of Virtue
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:43767:125"/>
and Goodneſs; <hi>The work of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is peace, and the effect of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs quietneſs and aſſurance for ever.</hi> All the good Actions that we do in this Life are ſo many ſeeds of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſown in our own Conſciences, which will ſpring up one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but eſpecially in the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Death, when we come to take a ſerious review of our lives; for then mens Conſciences uſe to deal plainly and impartially with them, and to tell them the truth, and if at that time more eſpecially <hi>our hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us not, then may we have comfort and confidence towards God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. An Holy and Virtuous Life doth tranſmit a good Name and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Poſterity. And this <hi>Solomon</hi> hath determined to be a much greater Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, than for a Man to leave a great Eſtate behind him: <hi>A good name</hi> ſays he, <hi>is rather to be choſen than great riches.</hi> Pious and Virtuous men do commonly gain to themſelves a good Eſteem and Reputation in this World, while they are in it; but the Virtues of good men are not always ſo bright and ſhining, as to meet with that
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:43767:126"/>
reſpect and acknowledgment which is due to them in this World. Many times they are much clouded by the Infirmities and Paſſions which attend them, and are ſhadowed by ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſingularities and moroſities, which thoſe which have liv'd more retir'd from the World are more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to. Beſides that the Envy of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who are not ſo good as they, lies heavy upon them, and does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them. For bad men are very apt to miſinterpret the beſt Actions of the good, and put falſe colours upon them, and when they have nothing elſe to object againſt them, to charge them with Hypocriſie and Inſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; an Objection as hard to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, as it is to be made good, unleſs we could ſee into the Hearts of men.</p>
            <p>But when good men are dead and gone, and the bright and ſhining Example of their Virtues is at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient diſtance, and does not gall and upbraid others, then Envy ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and every Man is then content to give a good Man his due Praiſe, and his Friends and Poſterity may
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:43767:126"/>
then quietly enjoy the Comfort of his Reputation, which is ſome ſort of Bleſſing to him that is gone. This difference <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves to us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and bad men; <hi>The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the juſt is bleſſed,</hi> or <hi>well ſpoken of: but the name of the wicked ſhall rot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> Religion and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue do derive a Bleſſing upon our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity after us. <hi>Oh, that there were ſuch an heart in them,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the People of <hi>Iſrael, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandments always, that it might be well with them and with their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for ever</hi>! And to this purpoſe there are many Promiſes in Scripture of God's <hi>Bleſſing the Poſterity of the righteous,</hi> and his <hi>ſhewing mercies to thouſands of the Children of them that love him, and keep his Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this a great motive to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and toucheth upon that Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affection which men bear to their Children; ſo that if we have any Regard to them, or Concernment for their Happineſs, we ought to be
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:43767:127"/>
very careful of our Duty, and afraid to offend God; becauſe according as we demean our ſelves towards him, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail a laſting Bleſſing or a great Curſe upon our Children; by ſo many and and ſo ſtrong bonds hath God tyed our Duty upon us, that if we either deſire our own Happineſs, or the Happineſs of thoſe that are deareſt to us, and part of our ſelves, we muſt <hi>fear God and keep his Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have briefly repreſented to you, ſome of the chief Benefits and Advantages which an Holy and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life does commonly bring to men in this World, which is the <hi>firſt</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement mention'd in the Text; <hi>ye have your fruit unto holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I proceed to the <hi>Second,</hi> I ſhall only juſt take notice, by way of Application, of what hath been ſaid on this Argument.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is a great Encouragement to well-doing, to conſider that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily Piety and Goodneſs are no hindrance to a Man's temporal Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but very frequently great promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:43767:127"/>
of it; ſo that excepting only the caſe of Perſecution for Religion, I think I may ſafely challenge any Man, to ſhew me how the Practice of any Part or Duty of Religion, how the exerciſe of any Grace or Virtue is to the prejudice of a Man's temporal Intereſt, or does debar him of any true Pleaſure, or hinder him of any real Advantage, which a prudent and conſiderate Man would think fit to chuſe. And as for Perſecution and Sufferings for Religion, God can Reward us for them, if he pleaſe, in this World, and we have all the aſſurance that we can deſire, that he will do it abundantly in the next.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The hope of long life, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of a quiet and comfortable death, ſhould be a great encouragement to an Holy and Virtuous Life. He that lives well, takes the beſt courſe to live long, and lays in for an happy old Age, free from the Diſeaſes and Infirmities which are naturally procur'd by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Youth, and likewiſe free from the guilt and galling Remembrance of a wicked Life. And there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which we can fall into in this
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:43767:128"/>
World, that does ſo clearly diſcover the difference between a good and bad Man, as a Death-bed: For then the good Man begins moſt ſenſibly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the comforts of Well-doing, and the Sinner to taſte the bitter fruits of Sin. What a wide difference is then to be ſeen, between the hopes and fears of theſe two ſorts of perſons! And ſurely next to the actual poſſeſſion of Bleſſedneſs, the good hopes and comfortable proſpect of it, are the greateſt Happineſs; and next to the actual ſenſe of Pain, the fear of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the greateſt Torment.</p>
            <p>Tho' there were nothing beyond this life to be expected, yet if men were ſure to be poſſeſs'd with theſe delightful or troubleſome Paſſions when they come to dye, no Man that wiſely conſiders things would, for all the Pleaſures of ſin, forfeit the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a Righteous Soul, leaving this World full of the hope of Immortality; and endure the vexation and anguiſh of a guilty Conſcience, and that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite terror and amazement which ſo frequently poſſeſſeth the Soul of a dying Sinner.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:43767:128"/>3. If there be any ſpark of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mind in us, it ſhould animate us to do well, that we may be well ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of when we are gone off the Stage, and may tranſmit a grateful Memory of our lives to thoſe that ſhall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us. I proceed now to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Thing I propoſed, as the great Advantage indeed, <hi>Viz.</hi> The glorious Reward of a Holy and Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life in another World, which is here called <hi>everlaſting Life; And the end everlaſting Life</hi>; by which the Apoſtle intends to expreſs to us, both the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of our future State, and the Way and Means whereby we are prepared and made meet to be made partakers of it; and that is by the conſtant and ſincere Endeavours of an holy and good Life. For 'tis they only that <hi>have their fruit unto holineſs,</hi> whoſe <hi>end</hi> ſhall be <hi>everlaſting Life.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak briefly to theſe <hi>two,</hi> and ſo conclude my diſcourſe upon this Text.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Happineſs of our future ſtate, which is here expreſt by the name of <hi>everlaſting Life</hi>; in very few words, but
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:43767:129"/>
ſuch as are of wonderful weight and ſignificancy: For they import the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of this ſtate, and the Eternity of it. And who is ſufficient to ſpeak to either of theſe Arguments? Both of them are too big to enter now into the heart of Man, too vaſt and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to be comprehended by humane underſtanding, and too unweildy to be manag'd by the Tongue of Men and Angels, anſwerably to the unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble greatneſs and glory of them. And if I were able to declare them unto you, as they deſerv'd, you would not be able to hear me. And therefore I ſhall chuſe to ſay but little upon an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which I can never ſay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and ſhall very briefly conſider thoſe <hi>two</hi> things which are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in that ſhort deſcription, which the Text gives us of our future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, by the name of <hi>everlaſting Life, viz.</hi> The Excellency of this ſtate, and the Eternity of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Excellency of it, which is here repreſented to us under the notion of <hi>Life,</hi> the moſt deſirable of all other things, becauſe it is the Foundation of all other Enjoyments whatſoever. Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be in being, and to be ſenſible
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:43767:129"/>
that we are ſo, is but a dry Notion of Life. The true Notion of Life is to be well and to be happy, <hi>vivere eſt benè valere.</hi> They who are in the moſt miſerable condition that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, are in being, and ſenſible alſo that they are miſerable. But this kind of Life is ſo far from coming under the true Notion of Life, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calls it <hi>the ſecond death. Revel.</hi> 21.8. it is there ſaid, that <hi>The wicked ſhall have their part in the lake that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</hi> And, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. ver. 6. <hi>Bleſſed and holy is he, that hath part in the firſt Reſurrection, on ſuch the ſecond death ſhall have no power.</hi> So that a ſtate of meer miſery and torment is not Life but Death; nay, the Scripture will not allow the Life of a wicked Man in this World to be true Life, but ſpeaks of him as dead. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. ſpeaking of the ſinners among the Gentiles, <hi>You,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>hath he quickned, who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> And which is more yet, the Scripture calls a Life of ſinful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures (which men eſteem the only Happineſs of this world) the Scripture, I ſay, calls this a Death, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. <hi>She that liveth in pleaſures, is dead whilſt
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:43767:130"/>
ſhe liveth.</hi> A lewd and unprofitable Life, which ſerves to no good end and purpoſe, is a Death rather than a Life. Nay, that decaying and dying Life which we now live in this World, and which is allayed by the mixture of ſo many infirmities and pains, of ſo much trouble and ſorrow, I ſay, that even this ſort of Life, for all that we are ſo fondly in love with it, does hardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the name of Life. But the Life of the world to come, of which we now ſpeak, this is Life indeed; to do thoſe things which we were made for, to ſerve the true Ends of our Being, and to enjoy the Comfort and Reward of ſo doing, this is the true notion of Life; and whatever is leſs than this, is Death, or a degree of it, and approach towards it. And therefore very well may Heaven and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be deſcrib'd by the notion of Life, becauſe <hi>truly to live</hi> and <hi>to be happy</hi> are words that ſignifie the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>But what kind of Life this is, I can no more deſcribe to you in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities of it, than <hi>Columbus</hi> could have deſcribed the particular Manners and Cuſtoms of the People of <hi>America,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he or any other perſon in theſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:43767:130"/>
parts of the World, had ſeen it or been there. But this I can ſay of it in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and that from the infallible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the great Creator and glorious Inhabitants of that bleſſed place, that it is a ſtate of pure Pleaſure and unmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled Joys, of Pleaſures more manly, more ſpiritual, and more refined, than any of the Delights of ſenſe, conſiſting in the enlargement of our Minds and Knowledge to a greater degree, and in the perfect exerciſe of Love and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in the Converſation of the beſt and wiſeſt Company, free from ſelf-intereſt, and all thoſe unſociable paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Envy, and Jealouſie, of Malice and Ill-will, which ſpoil the Comfort of all Converſation in this World, and, in a word, free from all other Paſſion or Deſign, but an ardent and almoſt equal deſire to contribute all, that by all means poſſible they can, to the mutual Happineſs of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For Charity reigns in Heaven, and is the brighteſt Grace and Virtue in the Firmament of Glory, far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhining all other; as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had himſelf been taken up into the third Heaven, does expreſly declare to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:43767:131"/>Farther yet, this bleſſed ſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts more particularly in theſe two things: In having our Bodies raiſed and refined to a far greater Purity and Perfection, than ever they had in this World; and in the conſequent Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the whole Man's Soul and Body, ſo ſtrictly and firmly united as never to be parted again, and ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually match'd as to be no trouble or impediment to one another.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In having our Bodies raiſed and refined to a far greater Purity and Perfection, than ever they had in this World. Our Bodies as they are now are unequally temper'd, and in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual flux and change, continually tending to Corruption, becauſe made up of ſuch contrary Principles and Qualities, as by their perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict are always at work, conſpiring the Ruin and Diſſolution of them; but when they are raiſed again, they ſhall be ſo temper'd and ſo refin'd, as to be free from all thoſe deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Qualities, which do now threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their change and diſſolution; and tho' they ſhall ſtill conſiſt of Matter,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:43767:131"/>
yet it ſhall be purified to that degree, as to partake of the Immortality of our Souls, to which it ſhall be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, and to be of equal duration with them. So the Scripture tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52, 53. <hi>That our dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall be raiſed incorruptible; for this corruptible muſt put on incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this mortal muſt put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Bodies when they are laid down in the Grave are vile Carca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but they ſhall be raiſed again Beautiful and Glorious, and as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what they were before, as the Heavenly Manſions in which they are to reſide for ever are from that dark Cell of the Grave out of which they are raiſed, and ſhall then be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with ſuch a Life and Strength and Vigour, as to be able without any change or decay to abide and continue for ever in the ſame ſtate.</p>
            <p>Our Bodies in this World are groſs Fleſh and Blood, liable to be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with natural and ſenſual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and to be afflicted with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pains and Diſeaſes, to be preſt
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:43767:132"/>
with the natural neceſſities of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Thirſt, and obnoxious to all thoſe Changes and Accidents to which all natural things are ſubject: But <hi>they ſhall be raiſed ſpiritual bodies,</hi> pure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd from all the dregs of Matter; they ſhall not hunger, nor thirſt, nor be diſeaſed, or in Pain any more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe Houſes of Clay, whoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is in the duſt,</hi> are continually decaying, and therefore ſtand in need of continual Reparation by Food and Phyſick: but <hi>our Houſe which is from Heaven,</hi> (as the Apoſtle calls it) ſhall be of ſuch laſting and durable Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, as not only Time, but even E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity it ſelf, ſhall make no impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon it, or cauſe the leaſt decay in it. <hi>They</hi> (ſays our Bleſſed Saviour) <hi>who ſhall be accounted worthy to obtain that World, and the Reſurrection from the dead, cannot die any more: but ſhall be like the Angels, and are the children of God,</hi> i. e. ſhall in ſome degree partake of the Felicity and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of God himſelf, <hi>who is always the ſame, and whoſe years fail not.</hi> Nay, the Apoſtle expreſly tells us, that our Bodies after the Reſurrection ſhall be
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:43767:132"/>
               <hi>ſpiritual Bodies,</hi> ſo that we ſhall then be as it were all Spirit, and our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall be ſo raiſed and refined, that they ſhall be no clog or impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Operation of our Souls. And it muſt needs be a great comfort to us whilſt we are in this World, to live in the hopes of ſo happy and glorious a change; when we conſider how our Bodies do now oppreſs our Spirits, and what a melancholy and dead weight they are upon them, how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous an Incumbrance and Trouble and Temptation they are for the moſt part to us in this mortal ſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The bleſſedneſs of this ſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts likewiſe in the conſequent Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the whole Man, Soul and Body, ſo ſtrictly and firmly united as never to be parted again, and ſo equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matched as to be no trouble and impediment to one another.</p>
            <p>In this World the Soul and Body are for the moſt part very unequally yok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that the Soul is not only darkned by the groſs Fumes and Clouds which riſe from the Body, but loaded and oppreſt by the dull weight of it, which it very heavily lugs on and draws af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:43767:133"/>
it; and the Soul likewiſe, and the vicious Inclinations and irregular Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, have many times an ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Body and the humours of it. But in the next World they ſhall both be purified, the one from Sin, and the other from Frailty and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and both admitted to the bleſſed ſight and enjoyment of the ever bleſſed God.</p>
            <p>But the Conſideration of this, (as I ſaid before) is too big for our narrow apprehenſions in this mortal ſtate, and an Argument not fit to be treated of by ſuch Children, as the wiſeſt of men are in this World; and whenever we attempt to ſpeak of it, we do but liſp like Children, and underſtand like Children, and reaſon like Children about it. <hi>That which is imperfect muſt be done away,</hi> and our Souls muſt be raiſed to a greater Perfection, and our Underſtandings fill'd with a ſtronger and ſteadier Light, before we can be fit to engage in ſo profound a Contemplation. We muſt firſt have been in Heaven, and poſſeſt of that Felicity and Glory which is there to be enjoyed, before
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:43767:133"/>
we can either ſpeak or think of it in any meaſure as it deſerves. In the mean time, whenever we ſet about it, we ſhall find our Faculties oppreſt and dazled with the weight and ſplendor of ſo great and glorious an Argument; like St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who, when <hi>he was caught up into Paradiſe,</hi> ſaw and heard thoſe things which when he came down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into this World, he was not able to expreſs, and which it was not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Tongue of Man to utter.</p>
            <p>So that in diſcourſing of the ſtate of the Bleſſed, we muſt content our ſelves with what the Scripture hath revealed in general concerning it; that it is a ſtate of perfect freedom from all thoſe Infirmities and Imperfections, thoſe Evils and Miſeries, thoſe Sins and Temptations which we are liable to in this World. So St. <hi>John</hi> deſcribes the Glory and Felicity of that ſtate, as they were in Viſions repreſented to him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2, 3, 4. <hi>And I</hi> John <hi>ſaw the holy City, the new</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>prepared as a Bride adorned for her Husband. And I heard a great voice out of Heaven, ſaying, Behold! the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God is with men, and he will
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:43767:134"/>
dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God. And God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there ſhall be no more death, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain: for the former things are paſſed away</hi>; that is, all thoſe Evils which we ſaw or ſuffered in this World, ſhall for ever vaniſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear, and, which is the great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege and Felicity of all that there ſhall no Sin be there, v. 27. <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth,</hi> and conſequently there ſhall be no Miſery and Curſe there. So we read, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.3, 4. <hi>And there ſhall be no more curſe; but the throne of God and of the Lamb ſhall be in it, and his ſervants ſhall ſerve him, and they ſhall ſee his face.</hi> In which laſt words our Employment and our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs are expreſt; but what in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular our Employment ſhall be, and wherein it ſhall conſiſt, is impoſſible now to deſcribe; it is ſufficient to know in the general, that our Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be our unſpeakable Pleaſure, and every way ſuitable to the Glory and Happineſs of that ſtate, and as
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:43767:134"/>
much above the nobleſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Employments of this World, as the Perfection of our Bodies, and the Powers of our Souls, ſhall then be above what they are now in this World.</p>
            <p>For there is no doubt, but that he who made us, and endued our Souls with a deſire of Immortality, and ſo large a Capacity of Happineſs, does un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand very well by what way and means to make us happy, and hath in readineſs proper Exerciſes and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments for that ſtate, and every way more fitted to make us Happy, than any Condition or Employment in this World is ſuitable to a temporal Happineſs; Employments that are ſuitable to <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> united to Bodies purified and refined almoſt to the Condition of Spirits; Employments which we ſhall be ſo far from being weary of, that they ſhall miniſter to us a new and freſh delight to all Eternity; and this perhaps, not ſo much from the variety, as from the perpetual and growing Pleaſure of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:43767:135"/>It is ſufficient for us to know this in the general, and to truſt the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power and Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, for the particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and circumſtances of our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; not doubting but that he, who is the eternal and inexhauſtible Spring and Fountain of all Happineſs, can and will derive and convey ſuch a ſhare of it to every one of us as he thinks fit, and in ſuch ways as he, who beſt underſtands it, is beſt able to find out.</p>
            <p>In a word, the Happineſs of the next Life ſhall be ſuch as is worthy of the great King of the World to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon his faithful Servants, and ſuch as is infinitely beyond the juſt Reward of their beſt Services; it is <hi>to ſee God,</hi> i. e. to contemplate and love the beſt and moſt perfect of Beings, and <hi>to be for ever with the Lord, in whoſe preſence is fullneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand there are pleaſures for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will ſay no more upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, leſt I ſhould ſay leſs, and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:43767:135"/>
becauſe whoever ventures to wade far into it, will ſoon find himſelf out of his depth, and in danger to be ſwallowed up and loſt in that great abyſs, which is not to be fathom'd by the ſhallow Faculties of Mortal men.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore only mention the</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thing I propoſed to ſpeak to, <hi>viz.</hi> The Eternity of this Happineſs; <hi>And the end everlaſting life</hi>; by which the Apoſtle intends to expreſs the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Perfection, but not the final Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the Happineſs of good men in another World. For to a perfect ſtate of Happineſs theſe two Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are requiſite, that it be immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and that it be interminable, that it can neither admit of a change nor of an end. And this is all that I ſhall ſay of it, it being impoſſible to ſay any thing that is more intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and plain, concerning that which is infinite, than that it is ſo. I ſhould now have proceeded to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thing I propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> By what Way and Means, we may be prepared, and made meet to be made
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:43767:136"/>
partakers of this Happineſs; and that is, (as I have told you all along) by the conſtant and ſincere endeavour of an Holy and good Life; for the Text ſuppoſeth that they only who are <hi>made free from Sin,</hi> and <hi>become the Servants of God,</hi> and who <hi>have their Fruit unto Holineſs,</hi> are they whoſe <hi>end</hi> ſhall be <hi>everlaſting Life</hi>: But this is an Argument which I have had ſo frequent occaſion to ſpeak to, that I ſhall not now meddle with it. All that I ſhall do more at preſent ſhall be to make an Inference or two from what hath been ſaid upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Conſideration of the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py State of good men in another World, cannot be but a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſupport to good men under all the Evils and Sufferings of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life. Hope is a great Cordial to the Minds of men, eſpecially when the thing hoped for does ſo vaſtly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh the preſent grievance and trouble. The Holy Scriptures, which reveal to us the Happineſs of our future ſtate, do likewiſe aſſure us that there is no compariſon between the Afflictions
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:43767:136"/>
and Sufferings of good men in this World, and the Reward of them in the other. <hi>I reckon</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) Rom.</hi> 8.8. <hi>that the ſufferings of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, are not worthy to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Particularly the Conſideration of that glorious change which ſhall be made in our Bodies at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ought to be a great comfort to us under all the Pains and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which they are now liable to, and even againſt Death it ſelf. One of the greateſt burdens of Humane Nature, is the frailty and infirmity of our Bodies, the neceſſities which they are frequently preſt withal, the Diſeaſes and Pains to which they are liable, and <hi>the fear of death,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof a great part of Mankind are <hi>ſubject to bondage</hi>; againſt all which, this is an everlaſting Spring of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to us, that the time is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when we ſhall have other ſort of Bodies, freed from that burden of Corruption which we now groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and from all thoſe Miſeries and Inconveniences which Fleſh and Blood
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:43767:137"/>
are now ſubject to. For the time will come, when <hi>theſe vile Bodies,</hi> which we now wear, <hi>ſhall be changed, and faſhioned like to the glorious Body of the Son of God</hi>; and when they ſhall be raiſed at the laſt day, they ſhall not be raiſed ſuch as we laid them down, Vile and Corrruptible; but Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal and Incorruptible: for the ſame Power which hath raiſed them up to Life, ſhall likewiſe change them, and put a glory upon them like to that of the glorified Body of our Lord; and when this glorious change is made, <hi>when this corruptible hath put on incorruption, and this mortal hath put on immortality, then ſhall come to paſs the ſaying that is written, Death is ſwallowed up in victory</hi>; and when this <hi>laſt enemy</hi> is perfectly ſubdued, we ſhall be ſet above all the Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Dangers, all the Temptations and Sufferings of this mortal ſtate; there will then be no <hi>fleſhly luſts</hi> and brutiſh Paſſions <hi>to War againſt the Soul</hi>; no <hi>law in our members</hi> to riſe up in Rebellion againſt <hi>the law of our minds</hi>; no diſeaſes to torment us, no danger of Death to terrifie us; all the Motions and Paſſions of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:43767:137"/>
Man ſhall then be perfectly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Reaſon of our Minds, and our Bodies ſhall partake of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of our Souls. How ſhould this Conſideration bear us up under all the Evils of Life and the fears of Death, that the Reſurrection will be a perfect Cure of all our Infirmities and Diſeaſes, and an effectual Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of all the Evils that we now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under; and that it is but a very little while that we ſhall be troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with theſe Frail, and Mortal, and Vile Bodies, which ſhall ſhortly be laid in the duſt, and when they are raiſed again, ſhall become Spiritual, Incorruptible, and Glorious!</p>
            <p>And if our Bodies ſhall undergo ſo happy a change, what Happineſs may we imagine ſhall then be conferr'd upon our Souls, that ſo much better and nobler part of our ſelves! As the Apoſtle reaſons in another Caſe, <hi>Doth God take care of Oxen?</hi> Hath he this Conſideration of our Bodies, which are but the brutiſh part of the Man? What regard will he then have to his own Image, that ſpark of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is for ever to reſide in theſe
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:43767:138"/>
Bodies? If upon the account of our Souls, and for their ſakes, our Bodies ſhall become <hi>Incorruptible, Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Glorious</hi>; then certainly our Souls ſhall be endued with far more Excellent and Divine Qualities: if our Bodies ſhall in ſome degree partake of the Perfection of our Souls in their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Immortal Nature; to what a pitch of Perfection ſhall our Souls be raiſed and advanced! even to an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Angels, and to ſome kind of participation of the Divine Nature and Perfection, ſo far as a Creature is capable of them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Compariſon which is here in the Text, and which I have large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explain'd, between the manifeſt Inconveniences of a Sinful and Vicious Courſe, and the manifold Advantages of an Holy and Virtuous Life, is a plain direction to us which of theſe two to chuſe. So that I may make the ſame appeal that <hi>Moſes</hi> does, after that he had at large declared the Bleſſings promis'd to the Obedience of God's Laws, and the Curſe denounc'd againſt the Violation and Tranſgreſſion of them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.19. <hi>I call Heaven and Earth
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:43767:138"/>
to record againſt you this day, that I have ſet before you life and death, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and curſing; therefore chuſe life,</hi> that you may be happy in Life and Death, and after Death to all Eternity. I know every one is ready to chuſe Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and to ſay with <hi>Balaam, Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my latter end be like his</hi>: but if we do in good earneſt deſire the End, we muſt take the Way that leads to it; we muſt <hi>become the Servants of God,</hi> and <hi>have our fruit unto holineſs,</hi> if ever we expect, that <hi>the end ſhall be everlaſting life.</hi>

            <p>In the handling of this Argument, I ſhall do theſe <hi>Six</hi> things.</p>
            <p>I. I ſhall ſhew what Reſolution is in general.</p>
            <p>II. What is the ſpecial Object of this kind of Reſolution.</p>
            <p>III. What is implyed in a ſincere Reſolution of leaving our Sins and returning to God.</p>
            <p>IV. I ſhall ſhew that in this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Amendment, the very eſſence and formal Nature of Repentance does conſiſt.</p>
            <p>V. I ſhall offer ſome Conſiderations to convince men, both of the neceſſity and fitneſs of this Reſolution, and of keeping ſtedfaſtly to it. <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I will not offend any more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:43767:141"/>VI. I ſhall add ſome brief directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the managing and maintaining of this holy and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reſolution.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What Reſolution in general is. It is a fixt Determination of the Will about any thing, either to do it, or not to do it, as upon due deliberation we have judged and concluded it to be neceſſary or convenient to be done, or not to be done by us: And this ſuppoſeth <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Reſolution ſuppoſeth a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deliberation of the Mind about the thing to be reſolved upon. For no prudent Man does determine or reſolve upon any thing, till he have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the thing, and weighed it well with himſelf, and have fully debated the neceſſity and expedience of it; what Advantage he ſhall have by the doing of it, and what danger and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience will certainly or very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly redound to him by the neglect and omiſſion of it. For peremptorily to determine and reſolve upon any thing, before a Man have done this, is not
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:43767:142"/>
properly Reſolution; but precipitancy and raſhneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Reſolution ſuppoſeth ſome Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſt upon the thing, after a Man hath thus deliberated about it; that he is ſatisfied in his Mind one way or other concerning it, that his Underſtanding is convinced either that it is neceſſary and convenient for him to do it, or that it is not; and this is ſometimes call'd Reſolution, but is not that Reſolution which immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determines a man to action. This Judgment of the neceſſity and fitneſs of the thing, is not the Reſolution of the Will, but of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for it does not ſignifie that a Man hath fully determined to do the thing, but that he hath determined with himſelf that it is reaſonable to be done, and that he is no longer in doubt and ſuſpence whether it be beſt for him to do it or not, but is in his Mind reſolved and ſatisfied one way or other. And theſe are two ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different things; to be reſolved in one's Judgment, that is, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that a thing is fit and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be done; and to be reſolved to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:43767:142"/>
ſet upon the doing of it; for many men are thus convinced of the fitneſs and neceſſity of the thing, who yet have not the heart, cannot bring themſelves to a firm and fixt Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſet upon the doing of it. So that an act of the Judgment, muſt go before the Reſolution of the Will: for as he is raſh that reſolves to do a thing before he hath deliberated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; ſo he is blind and wilful that reſolves to do a thing before his Judgment be ſatisfied, whether it be beſt for him to do it or not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the matter be of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble moment and conſequence, Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuppoſeth ſome motion of the Affections; which is a kind of Biaſs upon the Will, a certain Propenſion and Inclination that a Man feels in himſelf, either urging him to do a thing, or withdrawing him from it. Deliberation and Judgment they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a Man what to do, or leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; the Affections excite and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a Man to take ſome Reſolution in the matter, that is, to do ſuitably to the Judgment his Mind hath paſt upon the thing. For inſtance; A great
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:43767:143"/>
ſinner reflects upon his Life, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders what he hath done, what the Courſe is that he lives in, and what the iſſue and conſequence of it will probably or certainly be, whether it will make him happy or miſerable in the concluſion; and debating the Matter calmly and ſoberly with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he is ſatisfied and convinced of the Evil and Danger of a wicked Life, and conſequently that it is beſt for him to reſolve upon a better Courſe, that is, to repent. Now theſe thoughts muſt needs awaken in him fearful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the wrath of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, which is due to him for his Sins and hangs over him, and which he is every moment in danger of, if he goes on in his Evil Courſe. Theſe thoughts are apt likewiſe to fill him with Shame and Confuſion, at the remembrance of his horrible Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to God his Maker, his beſt Friend and greateſt Benefactor, and of his deſperate Folly in provoking Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Juſtice againſt himſelf; whereupon he is heartily grieved and troubled for what he hath done; and theſe Affections of Fear and Shame and Sorrow being once up, they come
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:43767:143"/>
with great violence upon the Will, and urge the Man to a ſpeedy Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of changing his Courſe, and leaving the Way he is in, which he is fully convinced is ſo Evil and Dangerous, and of betaking himſelf to another Courſe, which he is fully ſatisfied will be much more for his Safety and Advantage.</p>
            <p>So that Reſolution in general, is a fixt Determination of the Will; that is, ſuch a Determination as is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the preſent free from all wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and doubting, but ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prudently be altered, ſo long as the reaſon remains. For the Man who upon full Deliberation and Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Mind reſolves upon any thing, cannot without the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſickleneſs and inconſtancy quit that Reſolution, ſo long as he hath the ſame Reaſon which he had when he took it up, and is ſtill ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that the Reaſon is good. For inſtance; The Man who hath taken up a Reſolution to be Sober, becauſe of the uglineſs and unreaſonableneſs of Drunkenneſs, and the temporal Inconveniences and Eternal Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:43767:144"/>
which that Sin expoſeth a Man to; if theſe Reaſons be true and good, can never prudently alter the Reſolution which he hath taken, and return to that Sin again.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Let us conſider what is the ſpecial Object or Matter of this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, wherein the formal Nature of Repentance does conſiſt, what it is that a Man when he repents reſolves upon; and that I told you is to leave his Sin, and to return to God and his Duty; and this is the Reſolution which the Penitent here deſcribed in the Text takes up, <hi>I will not offend any more. That which I ſee not, teach thou me; and if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> He reſolves againſt all known Sin, <hi>I will not offend any more</hi>; and if through Ignorance he had ſinned and done contrary to his Duty, he deſires to be better inſtructed, that he may not offend again in the like kind, <hi>That which I ſee not, teach thou me; and if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the true Penitent reſolves upon theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:43767:144"/>
               <item>1. To forſake his Sin. And</item>
               <item>2. To return to God and his Duty.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. To forſake his Sin: and this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the quitting of his ſinful Courſe whatever it had been; and that not only by abſtaining from the outward act and practice of every Sin, but by endeavouring to crucifie and ſubdue the inward Affection and Inclination to it.</p>
            <p>And it implies farther, the utter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of Sin; for Repentance is not only a Reſolution to abſtain from Sin for the preſent, but never to return to it again. Thus <hi>Ephraim</hi> when he repented of his Idolatry, he utterly renounced it, ſaying, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols</hi>? Hoſ. 14.8. He that truly repents, is reſolved to break off his ſinful Courſe, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon thoſe Luſts and Vices which he was formerly addicted to, and lived in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The true Penitent reſolves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to return to God and his Duty:
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:43767:145"/>
he does not ſtay in the negative part of Religion, he does not only reſolve not to commit any Sin, but not to neglect or omit any thing that he knows to be his Duty; and if he has been ignorant of any part of his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he is willing to know it, that he may do it; he is not only determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to forſake his Sin, which will make him miſerable, but to return to God, who alone can make him happy: he is now reſolved to love God, and to ſerve him as much as he hated and diſhonoured him before; and will now be as diligent to perform and practiſe all the Duties and Parts of Religion, as he was negligent of them before, and as ready to do all the good he can to all men in any kind, as he was careleſs of theſe things before: theſe in general are the things which a true Penitent reſolves upon. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thing I propoſed to conſider, namely what is implyed in a ſincere Reſolution of leaving our Sins, and returning to God and our Duty. And this holy Reſolution, if it be thorow and ſincere, does imply in it theſe <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:43767:145"/>1. That it be Univerſal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it be a Reſolution of the Means as well as of the End.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it preſently come to effect, and be ſpeedily and without delay put in Execution.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A ſincere Reſolution of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be univerſal: a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to forſake all Sin, and to return to our whole Duty, and every part of it; ſuch a Reſolution as that of holy <hi>David, to hate every falſe way,</hi> and <hi>to have reſpect to all God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Reſolution muſt be univerſal in reſpect of the whole Man, and with regard to all our Actions: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the whole Man; for we muſt reſolve not only to abſtain from the outward Action of Sin, but this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution muſt have its effect upon our inward Man, and reach our very hearts and thoughts; it muſt reſtrain our inclinations, and <hi>mortifie our luſts and corrupt affections,</hi> and <hi>renew us in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:43767:146"/>
the</hi> very <hi>ſpirit of our minds,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle expreſſes it.</p>
            <p>And it muſt be univerſal, in reſpect of all our Actions. For this is not the Reſolution of a ſincere Penitent, to abſtain only from groſs and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, from ſcandalous and open Sins; but likewiſe to refrain from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of thoſe Sins which are ſmall in the eſteem of men, and not bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a Mark of publick Infamy and Reproach; to forbear Sin in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and when no Eye of Man ſees us and takes notice of us. This is not a ſincere Reſolution, to reſolve to practice the Duties and Virtues of Religion in publick, and to neglect them in private; to reſolve to perform the Duties of the firſt Table, and to paſs by thoſe of the ſecond; to reſolve to ſerve God, and to take a liberty to defraud and cozen men; to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour our Father which is in Heaven, and to injure and hate our Brethren upon Earth; <hi>to love our Neighbour, and to hate our Enemy,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> did of old time; to reſolve againſt Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to allow our ſelves the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeak falſely, and to break
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:43767:146"/>
our Word; to flee from Superſtition, and to run into Faction; <hi>to abhor I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and to commit Sacriledge</hi>; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to be devout at Church, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful in our Shops; to be very ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous about leſſer matters, and to be very zealous about indifferent things; <hi>to tithe mint and aniſe and cummin, and to omit the weightier matters of the Law, Mercy and Fidelity and Juſtice</hi>; to be very rigid in matters of Faith and Opinion, but looſe in Life and Practice.</p>
            <p>No; the Reſolution of a ſincere Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent muſt be univerſal and uniform: it muſt extend alike to the forbearing of all Sin, and the exerciſe of every Grace and Virtue, and to the due Practice and Performance of every part of our Duty. The true Penitent muſt reſolve for the future to abſtain from all Sin, <hi>to be holy in all manner of Converſation,</hi> and <hi>to abound in all the fruits of righteouſneſs, which by Jeſus Chriſt are to the praiſe and glory of God.</hi> For if a Man do truly repent of his wicked Life, there is the very ſame Reaſon why he ſhould reſolve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Sin, as why he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:43767:147"/>
againſt any; why he ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the Commandments of God, as why he ſhould keep any one of them. For as St. <hi>James</hi> reaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him that wilfully breaks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Commandment of God, that <hi>he is guilty of all,</hi> and <hi>breaks the whole Law</hi>; becauſe the Authority of God is equally ſtampt upon all his Laws, and is violated and contemned by the wilful tranſgreſſion of any one of them; <hi>For he that hath ſaid, thou ſhalt not kill, hath likewiſe ſaid, thou ſhalt not commit adultery, and thou ſhalt not ſteal</hi>: ſo he that reſolves againſt any one Sin, or upon Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of any one part of his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ought for the very ſame reaſon to make his Reſolution univerſal; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one Sin is Evil and Provoking to God, as well as another; and the Performance of one part of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty good and pleaſing to him, as well as another, and there is no difference. So that he that reſolves againſt any Sin, upon wiſe and reaſonable gounds, becauſe of the Evil of it, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the wrath of God to which it expoſeth us, ought for the ſame reaſon to reſolve againſt all Sin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:43767:147"/>
it is damnable <hi>to commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> and <hi>to ſteal,</hi> as well as <hi>to kill</hi>; and that Reſolution againſt Sin, which is not univerſal, it is a plain Caſe that it is not true and ſincere, and that it was not taken up out of the ſenſe of the intrinſical e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of Sin, and the danger of it in reſpect of God and the Judgment of another World; (for this Reaſon holds againſt every Sin, and remains always the ſame) but that it was taken up upon ſome inferior Conſideration, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe of the Shame and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy of it among men, or becauſe of ſome other temporal inconvenience, which if the Man could be ſecur'd againſt, he would preſently break his Reſolution, and return to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of that Sin, with as much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as any other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſincere Reſolution implies a Reſolution of the Means as well as of the End. He that is truly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly reſolved againſt any Sin, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reſolved to avoid as much as is poſſible the Occaſions and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which may lead or draw him to that Sin; or if they happen to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:43767:148"/>
preſent themſelves to him, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſtand upon his Guard and to reſiſt them. In like manner he that ſincerely reſolves upon doing his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in any kind, muſt reſolve upon the Means that are requiſite and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the due Diſcharge and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that Duty. As he that reſolves againſt that needleſs and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Sin of Swearing in common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, muſt reſolve alſo <hi>to ſet a guard before the door of his lips,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is certain that it requires great care and attention, at leaſt for ſome competent time, to get rid of a habit.</p>
            <p>When <hi>David</hi> reſolved <hi>not to offend with his Tongue,</hi> he reſolved at the ſame time to be very watchful over himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. <hi>I ſaid I will take heed to my ways, that I offend not with my Tongue: I will keep my mouth as with a bridle, while the wicked is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</hi> For a Man to reſolve againſt any Sin or Vice, and yet to involve himſelf continually in the occaſions, and to run himſelf into the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Temptation which do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and will almoſt neceſſarily lead and betray him into thoſe Sins, is a
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:43767:148"/>
plain evidence of inſincerity. This I take for a certain rule, that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can reaſonably move a Man to reſolve upon any End, will, if his Reſolution be ſincere and honeſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine him every whit as ſtrongly to uſe all thoſe Means which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to that end. But of this I have ſpoken elſewhere.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A ſincere Reſolution of leaving our Sins, and returning to God and our Duty, does imply the preſent time, and that we are to reſolve ſpeedily and without delay to put this Reſolution in practice; that we are peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined not to go one ſtep far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ways of Sin, not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect any Duty that God requires of us, not for one moment; but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and forthwith to ſet upon the practice of it, ſo ſoon as occaſion and oportunity is offer'd to us. And the Reaſon of this is evident; Becauſe the very ſame Conſiderations that prevail upon any Man to take up this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of amendment, and changing the Courſe of his Life, are every whit as prevalent to engage him to put
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:43767:149"/>
this Reſolution preſently in practice and execution.</p>
            <p>I deny not, but a Man may reſolve upon a thing for the future, and when the time comes, may execute his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and this Reſolution may for all that be very ſincere and real, tho' it was delayed to a certain time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not ſee Reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to do the thing ſooner: But it cannot be ſo in this Caſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; becauſe there can no good Reaſon be imagined, why a Man ſhould reſolve ſeven years hence to change his Courſe, and break off his ſinful Life, but the very ſame Reaſon will hold as ſtrongly, why he ſhould do it preſently and without delay; and over and beſides this, there are a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and powerful Reaſons and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, why he ſhould rather put this good Reſolution in preſent Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, than put it off and defer it to any farther time whatſoever.</p>
            <p>What is it that puts thee upon this Reſolution of leaving thy Sins, and urgeth thee to do it at all? Art thou reſolved to leave Sin, becauſe it is
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:43767:149"/>
ſo great an Evil? Why it is ſo for the preſent; the Evil of it is intrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to it, and cleaves to the very Nature of it, and is never to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from it: ſo that this is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Reaſon, and as ſtrong againſt it now, as ever it will be hereafter: nay it is ſtronger at preſent; becauſe if it be ſo great an Evil, the ſooner we leave it, the better.</p>
            <p>Or doſt thou reſolve to forſake Sin, becauſe thou art apprehenſive of the danger and miſchief of it, that it will expoſe thee to the wrath of God, and to the endleſs and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miſery of another World? Why this Reaſon likewiſe makes much more for the preſent leaving of it; becauſe the longer thou continueſt in a ſinful and impenitent ſtate, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is thy danger, and the greater Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty thou wilt moſt certainly incur; by delaying to put this good Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Practice, thou doſt increaſe and multiply the Cauſes of thy Fear. For hereby thou provokeſt God more, and every day doſt incenſe his wrath more and more againſt thee; thou prepareſt more and more fewel for
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:43767:150"/>
               <hi>everlaſting burnings,</hi> and <hi>treaſureſt up for thy ſelf</hi> more <hi>wrath, againſt the day of wrath, and the Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God.</hi> Nay thou doſt not only increaſe and aggravate; but thou doſt hereby haſten thine own Miſery and Ruine, and takeſt the moſt effectual Courſe that is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to bring thine own Fears, and the Vengeance of Almighty God, ſo much the ſooner upon thee. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing provokes God to take a ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er courſe with ſinners, and does more quicken the pace of his Judgments, than wilful continuance in Sin.</p>
            <p>And yet farther; If thy Reſolution be valuable and conſiderable to thee, thou takeſt the moſt effectual courſe in the World to fruſtrate and defeat it. Thou art fully reſolved to leave thy Sins hereafter, and thou thinkeſt thou haſt Reaſon for it: but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in them for the preſent, thou provokeſt the Juſtice of almighty God to cut thee off, before thy Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution hath taken effect.</p>
            <p>Again; Doſt thou reſolve to leave thy Sins one time or other, becauſe
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:43767:150"/>
thereby thou hopeſt to put thy ſelf into a Capacity of Pardon and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and of Eternal Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Why this Reaſon ſhould move thee to do the thing as ſoon as is poſſible; becauſe the ſooner thou forſakeſt thy Sins, thou haſt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hope of finding Mercy and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givneſs with God; and the ſooner thou beginneſt a Holy Courſe, and the longer thou continueſt therein, thou haſt Reaſon to expect a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more ample Reward. Thou canſt not by holding off, hope to bring down Pardon and Mercy to lower Rates, and to obtain theſe hereafter upon eaſier Terms: no; the Terms and Conditions of God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are already fixt and eſtabliſh'd, ſo as never to be alter'd.</p>
            <p>So that whatever Reaſon thou canſt poſſibly allege for taking up this Reſolution, it is every whit as forcible and powerful to perſwade thee to put it ſpeedily in Execution.</p>
            <p>And then there is this Reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and that a very conſiderable one, why thou ſhouldeſt immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:43767:151"/>
put this Reſolution in practice, and not delay it for a moment. Thou may'ſt at preſent do it much more certainly, and much more eaſily. Much more certainly; becauſe thou art ſurer of the preſent time, than thou canſt be of the future. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is in thy Power: but not one moment more. And thou may'ſt at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent do it more eaſily; for the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thou continueſt in Sin, thy Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution againſt it will ſtill grow weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the habit of Sin continually ſtronger. Thou wilt every day be more enſlaved by the Power of thy Luſts, and thy heart will every day be more <hi>hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> All the change that time makes, will ſtill be for the worſe, and more to thy diſadvantage. Sin will be as pleaſant to thee hereafter, and thou more loth to leave it, than at preſent. Sin was never mortified by Age. It will every day have more ſtrength to bind thee and hold thee faſt, and thou wilt every day have leſs to break looſe from it. For by every Sin thou doſt commit, thou addeſt a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the ſtrength and force of it; and ſo much ſtrength as thou addeſt

to it, ſo much thou takeſt from thy ſelf, and ſo much thou loſeſt of thine own Power and Liberty. For a Man and his Luſts are like Nature and a Diſeaſe: ſo much ſtrength as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe gains, Nature loſeth, and the Man is hereby doubly weakned: for he does not only loſe ſo much of his own ſtrength; but the Enemy gets it.</p>
            <p>Nay thou doſt hereby likewiſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit that auxiliary ſtrength and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which the Grace of God is ready to afford to men, his reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and his preventing Grace. For as a Man goes on in Sin, and advanceth in an evil Courſe, the Grace of God draws off by degrees, and his Holy Spirit doth inſenſibly leave him: and when a ſinner is come to this, his beſt Reſolutions will <hi>vaniſh like the morning cloud, and the early dew, which paſſeth away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it cannot be a true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Reſolution of leaving our Sins, if it do not take place, and have not its effect preſently. For there is no Man that takes up a Reſolution, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on weighty and conſiderable Reaſons,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:43767:152"/>
of doing any thing; but if the Reaſons upon which he takes it up urge him to do the thing at preſent, he will preſently ſet about it: and that Man is not reſolved to do a thing, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may pretend, who hath moſt Reaſon to do it at preſent, and may beſt do it now, and yet delays it.</p>
            <p>And thus I have opened to you the Nature of this holy Reſolution of leaving our Sins, and returning to God and our Duty; and have ſhewn what is neceſſarily implyed in ſuch a Reſolution, if it be ſincere and in good earneſt; That it be Univerſal; and that it be a Reſolution of the Means, as well as of the End; and that it preſently take place and be put in Execution. And theſe are <hi>three</hi> the beſt Signs and Marks that I know of, whereby a Man may try and examine the truth and ſincerity of that Reſolution of Amendment, which we call Repentance. If it be againſt all Sin, and have an equal regard to every part of our Duty; if when we reſolve upon the End, that is to avoid Sin, and to perform our Duty, we are equally reſolved
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:43767:152"/>
upon the Means that are neceſſary to thoſe Ends; if the Reſolution we have taken up commence preſently, and from that day forward be duly executed and put in practice, then is our Repentance and Reſolution of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment ſincere: but if there be a defect in any of theſe, our Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not as it ought to be.</p>

            <p n="3">III. What is implyed in a ſincere Reſolution of leaving our Sins, and returning to God and our Duty.</p>

            <p n="6">VI. To add ſome Directions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the managing and maintaining this holy Reſolution. The <hi>three</hi> firſt I have ſpoken to, I now proceed to the</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To ſhew that in this Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very Eſſence and formal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Repentance doth conſiſt. A Man may do many reaſonable Actions, without an explicit Reſolution. In things that are more eaſie and natural to us, Judgment and Reſolution are all one; it is all one to judge a thing fit to be done, and to reſolve to do it. But in matters of difficulty, when a Man is to ſtrive againſt the Stream, and to oppoſe ſtrong Habits that have taken deep root, there is nothing to be done without an explicit Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No Man makes any remarkable change in his Life, ſo as to croſs his Inclinations and Cuſtom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an expreſs Reſolution. For tho' a
<pb facs="tcp:43767:155"/>
Man's Judgment be never ſo much convinced of the reaſonableneſs and neceſſity of ſuch a change; yet unleſs a Man's Spirit be fortified and fixt by Reſolution, the power of Cuſtom, and the violence of his own Inclinations will carry him againſt his Judgment. Now there is no change of a Man's Life can be imagined, wherein a Man offers greater violence to inveterate Habits, and to the ſtrong Propenſions of his preſent temper, than in this of Repentance. So that among all the Actions of a Man's Life, there is none that doth more neceſſarily require an expreſs Purpoſe, than Repentance does.</p>
            <p>And that herein Repentance doth chiefly conſiſt, I ſhall endeavour to make evident from Scripture, and from the common apprehenſions of Mankind concerning Repentance.</p>
            <p>The Scripture, beſides the ſeveral deſcriptions of Repentance, uſeth two words to expreſs it to us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The former properly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the inward trouble and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which men conceive againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for having done amiſs; which
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:43767:155"/>
if it be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a godly ſorrow,</hi> it worketh in us <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, <hi>a Repentance not to be repented of,</hi> that is, ſuch a change of our Minds, which as we ſhall have no Cauſe to be troubled at, ſo no Reaſon to alter afterwards. And what is this, but a firm, ſtedfaſt, and unalterable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution?</p>
            <p>The Scripture likewiſe uſeth ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Phraſes of the like importance, to deſcribe Repentance by; as <hi>forſake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>turning from ſin,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> and <hi>turning to God. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking</hi> and <hi>turning from ſin.</hi> Hence it is call'd <hi>Repentance from dead works,</hi> Heb. 6.1. and <hi>turning to God,</hi> Acts 26.20. <hi>I have ſhewed to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that they ſhould repent and turn to God,</hi> that is, from the worſhip of Idols, to the true God. And we have both theſe together in the deſcription which the Prophet gives of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his ways, and the unrighteous Man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord.</hi> Now this change begins in the ſinners Reſolution of doing this; and the <hi>unrighteous Man's forſaking his
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:43767:156"/>
thoughts,</hi> is nothing elſe but chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the purpoſe of his Mind, and reſolving upon a better Courſe. And thus <hi>Lactantius</hi> deſcribes it: <hi>Agere autem poenitentiam nihil aliud eſt, quam affirmare &amp; profiteri ſe non amplius pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caturum. To repent is nothing elſe, but for a Man to declare and profeſs that he will ſin no more.</hi> This is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before men. And Repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, is a Reſolution anſwerable to this Profeſſion. And elſewhere ſaith the ſame Author, <hi>The Greeks do moſt fully expreſs Repentance by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe he that repents recovers his mind from his former folly, and is troubled at it,</hi> &amp; confirmat animam ſuam ad rectius vivendum, <hi>and confirms his mind for a better Courſe.</hi> And how is this done but by Reſolution?</p>
            <p>And that this is the natural and true notion of Repentance appears, in that the Heathens did conſent and agree in it. <hi>Gellius</hi> gives this deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. <hi>Poenitere tum dicere ſolemus, cum quae ipſi fecimus, ea nobis poſt inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt diſplicere, ſententiamque in iis noſtram demutamus. We are ſaid then to repent, when thoſe things which we
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:43767:156"/>
have done begin afterwards to diſpleaſe us, and we change our Reſolution about them.</hi> And ſo likewiſe one of the Philoſophers deſcribes it; <hi>Repentance is the beginning of Philoſophy, a flying from fooliſh words and actions, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the firſt preparation of a life not to be repented of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true indeed, Repentance ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the entire change of our Lives and Actions, and a continued ſtate, as the proper conſequence of it: but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is but the beginning of this change, which takes its riſe from the Purpoſe and Reſolution of our Minds; and if it be ſincere and firm, it will certainly have this effect, to change our Lives; and if it be not ſo, it is not Repentance. For tho' in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it be poſſible, that a Man may ſincerely reſolve upon a thing, and yet let fall his Reſolution afterwards, before it come into Act: yet in the Phraſe of Scripture, nothing is call'd Repentance, but ſuch a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution as takes effect, ſo ſoon as there is oportunity for it. If we change our Reſolution, and repent of our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:43767:157"/>
this is not that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Repentance unto Salvation.</hi> So that no Man that reads and conſiders the Bible, can impoſe upon himſelf ſo groſly, as to conceit himſelf a true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, and conſequently to be in a ſtate of Salvation, who hath been troubled for his Sins, and hath taken up a Reſolution to leave them, if he do not purſue this Reſolution, and act according to it.</p>
            <p n="5">V. I ſhall in the next place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſome Arguments and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to perſwade men to this holy Reſolution, and then to keep them firm and ſtedfaſt to it, ſo as never to change it after they have once taken it up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall propound ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to perſwade men to take up this Reſolution; and they are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider that this Reſolution of Repentance, is nothing but what, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of God's Grace and holy Spirit, which are never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſincere endeavours of men, is in your Power. And it is neceſſary
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:43767:157"/>
to premiſe this; for unleſs this be clear'd, all the other Arguments that I can uſe will ſignifie nothing. For nothing in the World could be more vain, than to take a great deal of pains to perſwade men to do a thing which they cannot do, to entreat them to attempt an Impoſſibility, and to urge and ſolicite them with all earneſtneſs and importunity to do that which is abſolutely and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of their Power. All the Commands of God; and the Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Word, and all the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Threatnings, whereby theſe Commands and Exhortations are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, do plainly ſuppoſe, either that it is in our Power to do the thing which God Commands or Exhorts us to; or elſe, if it be not (which I grant it is not) that God is ready by his Grace and Strength, if we be not wanting to our ſelves, to aſſiſt and enable us to thoſe Ends and Purpoſes. For the Goſpel ſuppoſeth a Power going along with it, and that the holy Spirit of God works upon the Minds of Men, to quicken and excite and aſſiſt them to their Duty. And if it were not ſo, the Exhortations of
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:43767:158"/>
Preachers would be nothing elſe, but a cruel and bitter mocking of ſinners, and an Ironical inſulting over the miſery and weakneſs of poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and for Miniſters to Preach, or People to hear Sermons, upon other Terms, would be the vaineſt expence of time, and the idleſt thing we do all the week; and all our Diſſwaſives from Sin, and Exhortations to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a good Life, and vehement Perſwaſions of men to ſtrive to get to Heaven and to eſcape Hell, would be juſt as if one ſhould urge a blind Man, by many Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments taken from the Advantages of Sight, and the Comfort of that Senſe, and the Beauty of external Objects, by all means to open his Eyes, and to behold the delights of Nature, to ſee his way, and to look to his ſteps, and ſhould upbraid him, and be very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him for not doing ſo. Why, if Reſolution be abſolutely impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us, and a thing wholly out of our Power, it is juſt the ſame Caſe. But then we ought to deal plainly and openly with men, and to tell them, that what we ſo earneſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to, is that which we
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:43767:158"/>
certainly know they cannot do. So that it is neceſſary, if I intend that the following Conſiderations ſhould do any good, to aſſure men, that it is not impoſſible for them to make a Reſolution of leaving their Sins, and returning to God.</p>
            <p>It is a Power which every Man is naturally inveſted withal, <hi>to Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> and <hi>Chuſe.</hi> To <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> that is, to weigh and compair things together. To <hi>Judge,</hi> that is, to determine which is beſt. And <hi>to Chuſe,</hi> that is, to reſolve to do it or not. And there is nothing more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and more univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in temporal Caſes, and in the Affairs and Concernments of this Life. In theſe matters Reſolution is a thing ordinary and of frequent practice; it is the Principle of all great and conſiderable Actions. Men reſolve to be great in this World, and by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Reſolution, when they have once taken it up, what induſtry will they not uſe! what hazards will they not run in the purſuit of their Ambitious Deſigns! Difficulties and Dangers do rather whet their
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:43767:159"/>
Courage, and ſet an edge upon their Spirits. Men reſolve to be rich; the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome <hi>that will be rich,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. <hi>They that will be rich</hi>: and tho' this be but a low and mean Deſign, yet theſe Perſons, by Virtue of this Reſolution, will toil and take prodigious pains in it.</p>
            <p>And as to Spiritual things, every Man hath the ſame Power radically, that is, he hath the Faculties of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Will; but theſe are obſtructed and hinder'd in their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and ſtrongly byaſſed a contrary way by the Power of Evil Inclinations and Habits; ſo that as to the exerciſe of this Power, and the effect of it in Spiritual things, men are in a ſort as much diſabled, as if they were deſtitute of it. For 'tis in effect all one, to have no Underſtanding at all to conſider things that are Spiritual, as to have the Underſtanding blinded by an invincible prejudice; to have no Liberty as to Spiritual things, as to have the Will ſtrongly byaſſed againſt them. For a Man that hath this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice upon his Underſtanding, and this byaſs upon his Will, it is to all
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:43767:159"/>
intents and purpoſes as if he were deſtitute of theſe Faculties. But then we are not to Underſtand this Impotency to be abſolutely natural, but accidental; not to be in the firſt Frame and Conſtitution of our Souls, but to have hapned upon the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Nature. It is not a want of natural Faculties, but the binding of them up and hindring their Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to certain purpoſes. This Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency proceeds from the Power of evil Habits. And thus the Scripture expreſſeth it, and compares an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency ariſing from bad Habits and Cuſtoms to a natural Impoſſibility; nothing coming nearer to Nature, than a powerful Cuſtom. <hi>Can the</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian <hi>change his Skin, or the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard his Spots? Then may ye alſo, that are accuſtomed to do evil, learn to do well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now God by the Goſpel hath deſigned the Recovery of Mankind from the ſlavery of Sin, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their Luſts; and therefore, as by the death of Chriſt he hath provided a way to remove the guilt of Sin, ſo by the Spirit of Chriſt he furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:43767:160"/>
us with ſufficient Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the dominion of Sin. I ſay <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi> if we be not wanting to our ſelves, but be <hi>workers together with God,</hi> and be as diligent <hi>to work out our own ſalvation,</hi> as he is ready <hi>to work in us both to will and to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that when we perſwade men to repent and change their Lives, and to reſolve upon a better Courſe, we do not exhort them to any thing that is abſolutely out of their Power; but to what they may do, tho' not of themſelves yet by the Grace of God, which is always ready to aſſiſt them, unleſs by their former groſs neglects and long obſtinacy in an evil Courſe, they have provoked God to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Grace from them. So that tho' conſidering our own ſtrength abſtractedly, and ſeparately from the Grace of God, theſe things be not in our Power; yet the Grace of God puts them into our Power.</p>
            <p>And this is ſo far from derogating from the Grace of God, that it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Praiſe of it. For if the Grace of God make us able to repent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:43767:160"/>
upon a new Life, he that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts this does not attribute his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to himſelf, but to the Grace of God: nay he that ſays that God's Grace excites, and is ready to aſſiſt men to do what God Commands, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents God immenſely more good and gracious, than he that ſays that God Commands men to do that which by their natural Power they cannot do, and will condemn them for not doing it, and yet denies them that Grace which is neceſſary to the doing of it.</p>
            <p>Let this then be eſtabliſh'd as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conſideration to prevent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, that to reſolve upon the change of our Lives, is that which by the Grace of God we are enabled to do, if we will. Reſolution is no ſtrange and extraordinary thing; it is one of the moſt common Acts that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to us as we are men; but we do not ordinarily apply it to the beſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. It is not ſo ordinary for men to reſolve to be good, as to be rich and great; not ſo common for men to reſolve againſt Sin, as to reſolve againſt Poverty and Suffering. It is not ſo uſual for men to reſolve to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:43767:161"/>
keep a good Conſcience, as to keep a good Place. Indeed our corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is much more oppoſite to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kind of Reſolution. But then to balance and anſwer this, God hath promiſed greater and more immediate aſſiſtance to us in this caſe, than in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other. There is a general bleſſing and common aſſiſtance promiſed to Reſolution and Diligence about tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things; and God's Providence doth often advance ſuch Perſons to riches and honour. <hi>The diligent hand, with God's bleſſing, makes rich,</hi> as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> tell us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. and 22, 19. <hi>Seeſt thou</hi> (ſays he) <hi>a Man diligent in buſineſs? He ſhall ſtand before Princes, he ſhall not ſtand before mean Perſons.</hi> Now diligence is the effect of a great and vigorous Reſolution. But there is a ſpecial and extraordinary bleſſing and aſſiſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that attends the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Endeavour of a holy Life. God hath not promiſed <hi>to ſtrengthen</hi> men <hi>with all might</hi> in the way to Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Honours, and to aſſiſt the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and covetous deſigners of this World, with <hi>a mighty and glorious Power, ſuch as raiſed up Jeſus from the Dead</hi>: but this he hath promiſed
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:43767:161"/>
to thoſe, who with a firm Purpoſe and Reſolution do engage in the ways of Religion. Let us then ſhake off our ſloth and liſtleſneſs, and in that ſtrength and aſſiſtance which God offers, let us reſolve to leave our Sins, and to amend our Lives.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider what it is that you are to reſolve upon; to leave your Sins, and to return to God and Goodneſs. So that the things I am perſwading you to reſolve upon, are the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Reaſons that can be for ſuch a Reſolution. Sin is ſuch a thing, that there can be no better Argument to make men reſolve againſt it, than to conſider what it is, and to think ſeriouſly of the Nature and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it. And God and Goodneſs are ſo amiable and deſirable, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry propoſal of theſe Objects hath invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and allurements enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our deſires after them, and to make us ruſh into the embraces of them. If we would but enter into the ſerious Conſideration of them, we ſhould ſoon be reſolved in our Minds about them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:43767:162"/>Do but conſider a little what Sin is. It is the ſhame and blemiſh of thy Nature, the reproach and diſgrace of thy Underſtanding and Reaſon, the great deformity and diſeaſe of thy Soul, and the eternal Enemy of thy Reſt and Peace. It is thy Shackles and thy Fetters, the Tyrant that oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thee and reſtrains thee of thy Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and Condemns thee to the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Slavery and the vileſt Drudgery. It is the unnatural and violent ſtate of thy Soul, the <hi>Worm</hi> that perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>gnaws</hi> thy Conſcience, the cauſe of all thy Fears and Troubles, and of all the Evils and Miſeries, all the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and Diſorders that are in the World; it is the Foundation and Fewel of Hell; it is that which puts thee out of the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of thy ſelf, which doth alienate and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thee from God the Fountain of Bliſs and Happineſs, which provokes him to be thine Enemy, and lays thee open every moment to the fierce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of his Juſtice, and if thou doſt perſiſt and continue in it, will finally ſink and oppreſs thee under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable weight of his wrath, and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:43767:162"/>
make thee ſo weary of thy ſelf, that thou ſhalt wiſh a thouſand times that thou hadſt never been; and will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee ſo perfectly miſerable, that thou wouldeſt eſteem it a great Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to exchange thy Condition with the moſt wretched and forlorn Perſon that ever lived upon Earth, to be perpetually upon a Rack, and to lie down for ever under the rage of all the moſt violent Diſeaſes and Pains that ever afflicted Mankind. Sin is all this which I have deſcribed, and will certainly bring upon thee all thoſe Evils and Miſchiefs which I have mentioned, and make thee far more miſerable than I am able to expreſs, or thou to conceive. And art thou not yet reſolved to leave it? Shall I need to uſe any other Arguments to ſet thee againſt it, and to take thee off from the Love and Practice of it, than this Repreſentation which I have now made of the horrible Nature and Conſequences of it?</p>
            <p>And then conſider on the other Hand, what it is that I am perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to turn to; to thy God and Duty. And would not this be a
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:43767:163"/>
bleſſed change indeed! To leave the greateſt Evil, and to turn to the chief Good! For this Reſolution of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, is nothing elſe but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to be wiſe and happy, and to put thy ſelf into the Poſſeſſion of that which is a greater good, if it is poſſible, than Sin is an Evil, and will render thee more happy, than Sin can make thee miſerable. Didſt thou but think what God is, and what he will be to thee, if thou wilt return to him, how kindly he will receive thee after all thy wandrings from him <hi>days without number,</hi> thou wouldſt ſoon take up the Reſolution of the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and ſay, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And conſider likewiſe what it is to return to thy Duty. It is nothing elſe but to do what becomes thee, and what is ſuitable to the Original Frame of thy Nature, and to the trueſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of thy Reaſon and Conſcience, and what is not more thy Duty, than it is thy Intereſt and thy Happineſs. For that which God requires of us, is to be righteous and holy and good, that is, to be like God himſelf, who
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:43767:163"/>
is the Pattern of all Perfection and Happineſs. It is to have our Lives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to his Will, which is always perfect holineſs and goodneſs, a ſtate of Peace and Tranquillity, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry temper and diſpoſition of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is that which is a principal and moſt eſſential Ingredient into the Felicity of the Divine Nature, and without which God would not be what he is, but a deformed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and miſerable Being.</p>
            <p>And if this be a true Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I have made to you, of Sin and Vice on the one Hand, and of God and Goodneſs on the other, what can be more powerful than the ſerious Conſideration of it, to engage us to a ſpeedy Reſolution of leaving our Sins, and of <hi>turning</hi> and <hi>cleaving to the Lord with full purpoſe of heart</hi>? After this we cannot but conclude with the Penitent in the Text; <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I will not offend any more: That which I ſee not, teach thou me: and if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:43767:164"/>3. Conſider how unreaſonable it is to be unreſolved in a Caſe of ſo great moment and concernment. There is no greater Argument of a Man's weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than Irreſolution in matters of mighty conſequence, when both the Importance of the thing, and Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of preſent circumſtances require a ſpeedy Reſolution. We ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a ſtrange folly, for a Man to be unreſolved in the cleareſt and plaineſt matters that concern his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral welfare and ſafety. If a Man could not determine himſelf whether he ſhould eat or ſtarve; if he were dangerouſly ſick, and could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether he ſhould take Phyſick or Die; or if one that were in Priſon, could not reſolve himſelf whether he ſhould accept of Liberty, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be releaſed; or if a fair Eſtate were offer'd to him, he ſhould deſire ſeven years time to conſider whether he ſhould take it or not; this would be ſo abſurd in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affairs of Life, that a Man would be thought infatuated, that ſhould be doubtful and unreſolved in caſes ſo plain, and of ſuch preſſing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:43767:164"/>
If a Man were under the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Condemnation of the Law, and liable to be executed upon the leaſt intimation of the Prince's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and a Pardon were graciouſly offer'd to him, with this intimation, that this would probably be the laſt offer of Mercy that ever would be made to him; one would think that in this Caſe a Man ſhould ſoon be determined what to do, or rather that he ſhould not need to deliberate at all about it; becauſe there is no danger of raſhneſs in making haſte to ſave his Life.</p>
            <p>And yet the Caſe of a ſinner is of far greater importance, and much more depends upon it, infinitely more than any temporal Concernment what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever can amount to, even our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery to all Eternity. And can there be any difficulty, for a Man to be reſolved what is to be done in ſuch a Caſe? No Caſe ſurely in the World can be plainer than this; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Man ſhould leave his Sins, and return to God and his Duty, or not, that is, whether a Man ſhould chuſe to be happy or miſerable, unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:43767:165"/>
and everlaſtingly happy, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely and eternally miſerable.</p>
            <p>And the circumſtances and exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our Caſe do call for a ſpeedy and peremptory Reſolution in this matter. The Sentence of the Law is already paſt, and God may execute it upon thee every moment, and it is great Mercy and Forbearance not to do it. Thy Life is uncertain, and thou art liable every minute to be ſnatch'd away and hurried out of this World. However at the beſt, thou haſt but a little time to reſolve in; Death and Judgment and Eternity cannot be far off, and for ought thou knoweſt they may be even at the door. Thou art upon the matter juſt ready to be ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon by Death, to be ſummon'd to Judgment: And to be ſwallowed up of Eternity: And is it not yet time thinkeſt thou to reſolve? Would'ſt thou have yet a little longer time to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate, whether thou ſhould'ſt repent and forſake thy Sins, or not? If there were difficulty in the Caſe, or if there were no danger in the delay; if thou couldſt gain time, or any thing elſe, by ſuſpending thy Reſolution; there
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:43767:165"/>
were then ſome Reaſon why thou ſhould'ſt not make a ſudden Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But thou canſt pretend none of theſe. It is evident at firſt ſight, what is beſt to be done, and nothing can make it plainer. It is not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo clear and out of Controverſie, that Riches are better than Poverty, and Eaſe better than Pain, and Life more deſirable than Death; as it is, that it is better to break off our Sins, than to continue in the Practice of them; to be reconciled to God, than to go on to provoke him; to be Holy and Virtuous, than to be Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Vicious; to be <hi>Heirs of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory,</hi> than to be <hi>Veſſels of wrath fitted for Deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is infinite danger in theſe delays. For if thy Soul be any thing to thee, thou ventureſt that; if thou haſt any tenderneſs and regard for thy eternal Intereſt, thou runneſt the hazard of that; if Heaven and Hell be any thing to thee, thou incurreſt the danger of loſing the one, and fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:43767:166"/>And thou gaineſt nothing by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing unreſolved. If Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would tarry thy leiſure, and wait till thou hadſt brought thy thoughts to ſome iſſue, and wert re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved what to do, it were ſomething: but thy Irreſolution in this matter will be ſo far from keeping back Death and Judgment, that it will both haſten and aggravate them, both make them to come the ſooner, and to be the heavier when they come: becauſe thou abuſeſt the goodneſs of God, and <hi>deſpiſeſt his patience and long-ſuffering, which ſhould lead thee</hi> and draw thee on <hi>to Repentance,</hi> and not keep thee back. Hereby thou encourageſt thy ſelf in thy lewd and riotous courſes, and, becauſe <hi>thy Lord delayeth his coming,</hi> art the more negligent and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant. Hear what doom our Lord pronounceth upon ſuch <hi>ſlothful and wicked ſervants,</hi> Luke 12.46. <hi>The Lord of that ſervant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in ſunder, and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him his portion with the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</hi> None ſo like to be ſurprized,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:43767:166"/>
and to be ſeverely handled by the Juſtice of God, as thoſe that trifle with his Patience.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider how much Reſolution would tend to the ſettling of our Minds, and making our Lives com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. There is nothing that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexeth and diſquieteth a Man more, than to be unreſolved in the great and important Concernments of his Life. What anxiety and confuſion is there in our Spirits, whilſt we are doubtful and undetermined about ſuch matters? How are we divided and diſtracted, when our Reaſon and Judgment direct us one way; and our Luſts and Affections biaſs us to the contrary? When we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and ſatisfied what is beſt for us; and yet are diſaffected to our own Intereſt. Such a Man is all the while ſelf-condemned, and acts with the perpetual regret of his Reaſon and Conſcience; and when ever he reflects upon himſelf, he is offended and angry with himſelf, his Life and all his Actions are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie and diſpleaſing to him; and there is no way for this Man to be
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:43767:167"/>
at peace, but to put an end to this conflict one way or other, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by conquering his Reaſon or his Will. The former is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, nothing being harder than for a ſinner to lay his Conſcience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, after it is once throughly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd; he may charm it for a while, but every little occaſion will rouze it again, and renew his Trouble; ſo that tho' a Man may have ſome Truce with his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet he can never come to a firm and ſettled Peace this way: but if by a vigorous Reſolution a Man would but Conquer his Will, his Mind would be at reſt, and there would be a preſent calm in his Spirit. And why ſhould we be ſuch enemies to our own Peace, and to the Comfort and Contentment of our Lives, as not to take this courſe, and thereby rid our ſelves at once of that, which really and at the bottom is the ground of all the trouble and diſquiet of our Lives?</p>

                  <p>Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more. That which I ſee not, teach thou me; if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</p>

            <p>THESE words are a Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the temper and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of a true Penitent, his Confeſſion of Sins, and, Reſolution of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Concerning Reſolution I have ſhewn what it is in general: What
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:43767:168"/>
is the ſpecial Object or Matter of this kind of Reſolution:<note place="margin">Vol. 8.</note> What is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in a ſincere Reſolution of leaving our Sins, and returning to God and our Duty: That in this Reſolution the very Eſſence and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Nature of Repentance doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt: And have offer'd ſome Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to convince men of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fitneſs of this Reſolution, and to keep them ſtedfaſt to it. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this Reſolution is nothing but what under the influence of God's Grace is in our Power.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The things themſelves, which we are to reſolve upon, are the ſtrongeſt Arguments that can be for ſuch a Reſolution.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How unreaſonable it is for men to be unreſolved in a Caſe of ſo great moment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How much this Reſolution will tend to the ſettling of our Minds, and making our Lives Comfortable. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Conſiderations which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:43767:168"/>5. Then be pleaſed to conſider, that a ſtrong and vigorous Reſolution would make the whole Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion eaſie to us, it would conquer all difficulties which attend a Holy and Religious Courſe of Life, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at our firſt entrance into it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Reſolution brings our Minds to a Point, and unites all the ſtrength and force of our Souls in one great Deſign, and makes us vigorous and firm, couragious and conſtant in the Proſecution of it; and without this it is impoſſible to hold out long, and to reſiſt the ſtrong Propenſions and Inclinations of our corrupt Nature, which, if we be not firmly reſolved, will return and by degrees gain upon us; it will be impoſſible to break through Temptations, and to gain-ſay the importunity of them; when the Devil and the World ſolicit us, we ſhall not be able to ſay them nay, but ſhall be apt to yield to them.</p>
            <p>There are many, who have had faint wiſhes and cold deſires, and half purpoſes of leading a new and better Life: but having not taken up a firm
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:43767:169"/>
Reſolution in the Caſe, having not determined themſelves by a ſevere purpoſe, a little thing ſways them, and brings them back to their former Courſe; 'tis no hard matter to divert them and engage them another way; they are <hi>ſhaken with every wind</hi> of Temptation, every little blaſt of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Perſecution turns them back, and carries them to the ways of Sin: whereas Reſolution fixeth a Man's Spirit, and makes it moſt ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt and unmovable, and ſets him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>a Rock,</hi> which, <hi>when the winds blow, and the rain falls, and the floods come,</hi> abides firm againſt all impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>If I would give the moſt probable and uſeful advice to engage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a Man in a good Courſe, I would commend to him a deliberate and firm Reſolution. <hi>David</hi> proved this way with very happy ſucceſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.106. <hi>I have ſworn</hi> (ſays he) <hi>and will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgments.</hi> This was a ſecurity to him againſt all aſſaults, and nothing could turn him from his Courſe afterwards; not the dangers he
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:43767:169"/>
was expoſed to, <hi>v.</hi> 109. <hi>My ſoul is continually in my hand, yet do I not forget thy Law</hi>; not the ſnares of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men that were laid for him, <hi>v.</hi> 110. <hi>The wicked have laid a ſnare for me, yet I erred not from thy precepts.</hi> By virtue of this Reſolution he could riſe up in defiance of all thoſe that would have tempted him to any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful action, <hi>v.</hi> 115. <hi>Depart from me ye evil doers: for I will keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When a Man is thus reſolved upon a holy Courſe, he is not eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from it, and is able to reſiſt the importunity and flattery of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and to ſay to them, as men are wont to do, when they are fully and firmly reſolved upon any thing; <hi>Let me alone, I am not to be moved, it is in vain to urge me, I am reſolved to the contrary.</hi> Thus ſtiff and reſolute men can be in other Caſes, where there is not near that Cauſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it: and if we would but take up a generous Reſolution to break off our Sins, and to live better Lives, this would be the way to conquer that liſtleſneſs and unwillingneſs, which
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:43767:170"/>
hinders us from engaging in a good Courſe, and is the cauſe of ſo many lame excuſes and unreaſonable delays. It is the want of Reſolution, and the weakneſs of our Reſolutions, which is the true Reaſon why we are not more equal and conſtant and uniform in the ways of Religion; but are religious only by fits and ſtarts, in a heat, and during ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Trouble and Conviction of Mind. <hi>The double minded Man is unſtable,</hi> ſays St. <hi>James, in all his ways.</hi> When a Man is of ſeveral Minds, he is eaſily moved one way or other.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> Conſider the infinite danger of remaining unreſolved. <hi>The evil day</hi> may <hi>overtake you,</hi> while you are deliberating whether you ſhould avoid it or not. A ſtate of Sin is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſo many hazards, hath ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangers continually threatning it, and hanging over it, that it is the moſt imprudent thing in the World to linger in it. It is like <hi>Lot's</hi> ſtaying in <hi>Sodom,</hi> when the Lord was going to deſtroy it, when Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone were juſt ready to be rained down from Heaven upon it. Whilſt
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:43767:170"/>
men are lingring in a ſinful ſtate, if <hi>the Lord be not merciful to them,</hi> they will be conſumed. Therefore it concerns thee Sinner, to determine thy ſelf ſpeedily, and to make haſte out of this dangerous Condition, <hi>to eſcape for thy Life, leſt ſome evil overtake thee,</hi> and leſt Death finding thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved, determine thy caſe for thee, and put it out of all doubt, and paſt all remedy.</p>
            <p>How many have been cut off in their Irreſolution? And becauſe they would not determine what to do, God hath concluded their caſe for them, and <hi>ſworn in his wrath, that they ſhould not enter into his reſt.</hi> It may be thou promiſeſt thy ſelf the ſpace of many years to reſolve in: <hi>Thou fool, this night thy ſoul</hi> may <hi>be required of thee,</hi> and whilſt thou art unreſolved what to do, God is reſolving what to do with thee, and putting a Period to his Patience and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of thy Repentance: and thou knoweſt not how ſoon God may do this, and make an immutable Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination concerning thee. And wo
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:43767:171"/>
unto thee, when God hath reſolved thus.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe thou ſhouldſt be ſnatched out of the World, and hurried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dreadful Tribunal of God, in this doubtful and unreſolved ſtate. And this is poſſible enough; becauſe thou haſt no certain tenure of thy Life, thou art at no time ſecured from the ſtroke of Death: Nay it is probable enough; becauſe thou art every moment liable to ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand accidents, any one of which may ſnap in ſunder the thread of thy Life. And ſuppoſe this ſhould happen to thee, what doſt thou imagine would become of thee? Wouldſt not thou then wiſh a thouſand times, that thou hadſt reſolved in time? How glad wouldſt thou then be, that it were poſſible for thee to retrieve and call back but <hi>one</hi> of thoſe <hi>days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number,</hi> which thou haſt ſo vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trifled away, that thou mighteſt reſolve upon <hi>the things of thy peace:</hi> but <hi>thou wouldſt not</hi> do it <hi>in that thy day,</hi> which God afforded thee to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; thou haſt let the opportunity ſlip out of thy hands, and it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:43767:171"/>
be in thy Power again, but <hi>the things of thy peace will be</hi> for ever <hi>hid from thine eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why wilt thou then be ſo fooliſh, as to run thy ſelf upon the evident hazard of loſing Heaven, and being miſerable for ever? Why wilt thou make work for a ſadder and longer Repentance, than that which thou doſt now ſo carefully decline? This was the caſe of <hi>the fooliſh Virgins</hi> in the Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. who made account to be ready <hi>to meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom</hi> at his coming, but took no care in time to get <hi>Oyl into their Lamps.</hi> They thought the Bridegroom would <hi>tarry</hi> yet a while longer, and therefore <hi>they ſlumbered and ſlept</hi> in great ſecurity: but <hi>at mid-night,</hi> when <hi>the cry was made, Behold the Bridegroom cometh</hi>; then they <hi>aroſe,</hi> and in a great hurry and confuſion went about <hi>trimming their Lamps</hi>; they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved then, they would have beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or bought Oyl, and would have been at any pains and coſt for it: but then it was too late; for <hi>the door was</hi> ſuddenly <hi>ſhut</hi> againſt them,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:43767:172"/>
and no importunity could prevail to have it opened to them.</p>
            <p>Canſt thou be contented to have <hi>the Door ſhut</hi> againſt thee, and when thou ſhalt cry, <hi>Lord open unto me,</hi> to have him return this anſwer, <hi>Depart from me, I know thee not?</hi> If thou canſt not; reſolve to prevent this in time.</p>
            <p>Didſt thou but ſee, and know, and feel, what the miſerable do in Hell, thou couldſt not linger thus, thou couldſt not continue ſo long unreſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Why the time will come, when thou wilt reflect ſeverely upon thy ſelf, and ſay, That I ſhould ever be ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and ſottiſh, to be unreſolved in a matter of ſuch infinite concernment to me! How often was I admoniſh'd and convinced of the neceſſity of changing my courſe? How many inward Motions had I to that purpoſe? How often did my own Reaſon and Conſcience, and the holy Spirit of God, by his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and friendly ſuggeſtions, put me upon this? How often was I juſt upon the brink of reſolving? I reſolved to reſolve; but ſtill I delayed it till Death
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:43767:172"/>
ſeized upon me unreſolved: and now the opportunity is loſt, and never to be recover'd again. I would not in time reſolve to be wiſe and happy: and now by the Sentence of the juſt and unchangeable God, it is reſolved that I muſt be miſerable to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>How ſhould theſe Conſiderations quicken us, who have yet theſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities in our Hands; which thoſe thoſe who neglected and trifled them away would now purchaſe at any rate! I ſay how ſhould theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which I have propoſed, move us to take up a preſent Reſolution in the matter! Conſider theſe things, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and lay them ſeriouſly to Heart, and ſay to thy ſelf, Fool that I have been, to be unreſolved ſo long; not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine my ſelf in a matter of ſuch mighty conſequence; to continue ſo long in ſuſpence, whether I had beſt go to Heaven or Hell, and which was moſt adviſable to be happy or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for ever! Bleſſed be God that hath been pleaſed to exerciſe ſo much Patience and Long-ſuffering towards me, that hath ſpared me ſo long,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:43767:173"/>
when he might have taken me away, and cut me off unreſolved. My Soul lies at ſtake, and for ought I know all Eternity depends upon my preſent and ſpeedy Reſolution. And now by God's Grace I will not delay one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more, I will hang no longer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Hell. I ſhall now in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> place, offer ſome Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to perſwade thoſe that have taken up this good Reſolution, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it, and to promote it to Practice and Execution, and to keep firm and ſtedfaſt to it. And to this end, be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to conſider theſe <hi>three</hi> things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What an Argument it is of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and inconſtancy, to change this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, whilſt the Reaſon of it ſtands good and is not changed. I ſuppoſe that thou wert once reſolved to leave thy Sins, and to return to God and thy Duty. Why doſt thou not purſue this Reſolution? Why doſt thou not perſiſt in it? Surely there appeared to thee ſome Reaſon why thou didſt take it up; and if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon remain, and appear ſtill the ſame
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:43767:173"/>
to thee that it did, How comes it to paſs that thou haſt alter'd thy Mind, and changed thy Purpoſe? Either the Caſe is the ſame it was, when thou took<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt up this Reſolution; or it is not. If it be altered, then thou haſt Reaſon to change thy Reſolution: if it be not, thou haſt the ſame Reaſon to continue in it, that thou hadſt to take it up. Shew then, if thou canſt, wherein it is changed. Wert thou miſtaken before about the Nature of Sin, and the pernicious conſequences of it; or about the Nature of God and Goodneſs? Haſt thou any thing now to plead for Sin, which thou didſt not know or conſider before? Art thou now ſatisfied that Sin is not ſo evil and unreaſonable a thing, as thou didſt once apprehend, or that it does not threaten thee with ſo much danger as thou didſt fear? Hath God alter'd his opinion of it, or is he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more favourable to it than he was? Haſt thou received any news lately from Heaven by any good Hands, that God hath reverſt his threatnings againſt Sin, or that he hath adjourn'd the Judgment of the World, <hi>ſine die,</hi> without any ſet time? That he hath
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:43767:174"/>
ſet the Devils at Liberty, and releaſt them from their Chains of darkneſs, and hath quenched and put out the fire of Hell? Or art thou ſatisfied that there is no ſuch Being as God in the World, or that he is not ſo good as thou didſt apprehend him to be, or that he will not reward thoſe that diligently ſerve him? Haſt thou found upon Tryal, that Holineſs and Virtue are but empty Names, and that there is nothing in them? That there is not that Pleaſure and Peace in keeping the Commandments of God, which thou wert told of? I am ſure thou canſt not with Reaſon pretend any thing of all this. Thy Reaſon and Conſcience and Experience cannot ſpeak one word on the behalf of Sin, or give any Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemony againſt God and his holy ways. And if the Caſe be the ſame it was, nothing but thine own vanity and fickleneſs, or ſome worſe Reaſon, could move thee to alter thy purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let it be farther conſidered, That if we be not conſtant to our Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all we have done is loſt. If thou repenteſt of thy Repentance, it will not prove <hi>a Repentance to Salvation.</hi>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:43767:174"/>
As good to have ſtayed in <hi>Sodom,</hi> as to look back after thou art come out of it. Thus God tells us by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.12, 13. <hi>Therefore thou ſon of Man, ſay unto the children of thy People, The righteouſneſs of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhall not deliver him in the day of his tranſgreſſion; neither ſhall the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous be able to live in the day that he ſinneth. When I ſay to the righteous, He ſhall ſurely live: if he truſt to his own righteouſneſs, and commit iniquity, all his righteouſneſs ſhall not be remembred: but for his iniquity that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he ſhall die for it.</hi> So that whatever we have done in the Work of Repentance, what Reſolutions ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have taken up; if afterwards we give over and let them fall, all that we have done is loſt, and will come to nothing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us conſider in the laſt place, that if we be not conſtant to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, we ſhall not only loſe all that we have done, but we ſhall thereby render our Condition much worſe. <hi>Remember Lot's Wife,</hi> who, after ſhe was eſcaped out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> look't back, and was made a particular and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:43767:175"/>
laſting monument of God's wrath and diſpleaſure; which ſeems to be meant by that expreſſion of her being <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a Pillar of Salt,</hi> that is, <hi>a laſting monument.</hi> Prov. 14.14. <hi>The backſlider in heart ſhall be filled with his own ways. Shall be filled with his own ways</hi>; this expreſſion doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a moſt heavy and dreadful curſe upon thoſe, who fall off from their good Purpoſe and Reſolution, that they ſhall have Sorrow and Trouble enough upon it. For ſo likewiſe <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26, 27. where God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens wilful and obſtinate Sinners with the heavieſt Judgments, that he would <hi>laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear comes, when their fear comes as deſolation, and their deſtruction as a whirl-wind, and fear and anguiſh cometh upon them</hi>; he adds, as the ſum of all other Judgments, that <hi>they ſhall eat the fruit of their own ways, and be filled with their own devices.</hi> Heb. 10.38. <hi>But if any Man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him</hi>; which words are a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and ſignifie a great deal more than ſeems to be expreſt, <hi>My ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him,</hi> that is, let ſuch an one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:43767:175"/>
the effects of God's fierceſt wrath and diſpleaſure. For ſo the <hi>Hebrews</hi> are wont to expreſs things that are great and unſpeakable; when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſufficiently ſet them forth, by ſaying leſs, they ſay more. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4. Where it is ſaid, <hi>Thou art not a God that haſt pleaſure in wickedneſs,</hi> the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> means, and would have us to underſtand it ſo, that God is ſo far from taking any Pleaſure in the Sins of men, that he bears the moſt violent hatred and diſpleaſure againſt them. So when the Apoſtle here ſays, <hi>If any Man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him,</hi> he means, that it is not to be expreſt how God will deal with ſuch Perſons, and how ſeverely his Juſtice will handle them. To the ſame purpoſe is that Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21. <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the Pollutions of the World, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again entangled therein and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning. For it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them, not to have known the way of righteouſneſs, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:43767:176"/>
delivered unto them.</hi> The condition of all impenitent ſinners is very ſad; but of Apoſtates much worſe: not only becauſe the Sins which they commit afterwards are much greater, receiving a new aggravation, which the Sins of thoſe who are ſimply impenitent are not capable of; but likewiſe, becauſe ſuch Perſons are uſually more wicked afterwards. For they that break looſe from ſevere Purpoſes and Reſolutions of a better Courſe, do by this very thing in a great meaſure fear and conquer their Conſciences; and then no wonder if afterwards <hi>they give up themſelves to commit all iniquity with greedineſs.</hi> When after long abſtinence men return to Sin again, their Luſts are more fierce and violent; like a Man who, after long faſting, returns to his meat with a more raging appetite. This our Saviour ſets forth to us in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the unclean Spirit's returning again and taking poſſeſſion of the Man, after he had left him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.43, 44, 45. <hi>When the unclean Spirit is gone out of a Man, he walketh through dry places, ſeeking reſt, and findeth none. Then he ſaith, I will return into my
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:43767:176"/>
Houſe from whence I came out: And when he is come, he findeth it empty, ſwept, and garniſht. Then goeth he, and taketh with himſelf ſeven other Spirits more wicked than himſelf; and the end of that Man is worſe than his beginning.</hi> The Moral of which is, that when a Man hath once left his Sins, if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he entertain thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to them again, Sin will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon him with redoubled force and ſtrength, and his Heart will be but ſo much the more prepared and diſpoſed for the entertaining of more and greater Vices, and his leaving his Sins for a time will be but like a running back, that he may leap with greater violence into Hell and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>Beſides that ſuch Perſons do the greateſt injury to God and the holy ways of Religion, that can be, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking them after they have owned and approved them. For it will not be ſo much regarded, what wicked men, who have always been ſo, talk againſt God and Religion; becauſe they do not talk from Experience, but <hi>ſpeak evil of the things which they
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:43767:177"/>
know not</hi>: whereas thoſe who forſake the ways of Religion after they have once engaged in them, do diſparage Religion more effectually, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it with greater Advantage; becauſe they pretend to ſpeak from the Experience they have had of it; they have tryed both the ways of Sin, and the ways of Religion, and after Experience of both, they return to Sin again; which, what is it but to Proclaim to the World, that the ways of Sin and Vice are rather to be choſen than the ways of Holineſs and Virtue; that the Devil is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Maſter than God, and that a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and wicked Life yields more Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and greater Advantages, than are to be had in keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God? And this muſt needs be a high Provocation, and a heavy Aggravation of our Ruin. Let theſe Conſiderations prevail with us, to purſue this holy Reſolution, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have taken it up, and to perſiſt in it. There remains only tho</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And <hi>laſt</hi> particular which I propoſed to be ſpoken to, <hi>viz.</hi> To add ſome directions for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:43767:177"/>
and making good of this Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Repentance and Amendment; and they ſhall be theſe <hi>three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us do all in the ſtrength of God, conſidering our neceſſary and eſſential dependance upon him, and that <hi>without him</hi> and the aſſiſtance of his Grace <hi>we can do nothing. We are not</hi> (as the Apoſtle tells us) <hi>ſufficient of our ſelves, as of our ſelves,</hi> that is, without the aſſiſtance of God's holy Spirit, <hi>to think any thing</hi> that is good; much leſs to reſolve upon it. <hi>It is God that worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> that is, of his own goodneſs, as the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. It is God that upholds us in Being, and from whom we have all our Power as to natural Actions: but as to ſpiritual things, conſidering the great Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Depravation of Humane Nature, we ſtand in need of a more eſpecial and immediate aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>If we know any thing of our ſelves, we cannot but know what fooliſh and ignorant Creatures we are, how weak and impotent, how averſe
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:43767:178"/>
and oppoſite to any thing that is good. And therefore it is wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in all Caſes, but chiefly in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Matters, which <hi>Solomon</hi> gives <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thine Heart, and l<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an not to thine own underſtanding. Acknowledge him in all thy ways: and he ſhall direct thy ſteps.</hi> Let us then addreſs our ſelves to God, in the words of the holy Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.23. <hi>O Lord, I know that the way of Man is not in himſelf, and that it is not in Man that walketh, to direct his ſteps.</hi> And let us beg of him, that he would conſider our Caſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate our weakneſs, and pity our impotency, and that he would joyn his ſtrength to us, and grant us the aſſiſtance of his Grace and holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to put us upon ſincere Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a new Life, and to keep us conſtant and ſtedfaſt to them; <hi>to open the Eyes of our Minds, and to turn us from darkneſs to light, and from the Power of Satan and our Luſts, unto God; that we may repent and turn to God, and do works meet for Repentance, that ſo we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive forgiveneſs of Sins, and an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:43767:178"/>
among them that are ſanctified through faith that is in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for our Encouragement in this matter, God hath bid us to apply our ſelves to him, and he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed not to be wanting to us, in words as expreſs and univerſal as can well be deviſed, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6. <hi>If any Man lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and upbraideth no Man: but let him ask in Faith, nothing wavering,</hi> that is, not doubting but that God is both able and willing to give what he asks. And <hi>Luke</hi> 11.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>I ſay unto you, Ask, and it ſhall be given you; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that ſeeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened. If a Son ſhall ask bread of any of you that is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will he give him a ſtone? Or if he ask a fiſh, will he for a fiſh give him a Serpent? Or if he ſhall ask an Egg, will he offer him a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:43767:179"/>
how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> To encourage our Faith, our Saviour uſeth ſuch an Argument as may give us the greateſt aſſurance. We are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confident, that our earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents will not deny us thoſe things, that are good and neceſſary for us, tho' <hi>they</hi> may be otherwiſe evil: <hi>how much more then ſhall our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father,</hi> who is eſſentially and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely good, <hi>give his holy Spirit to us?</hi> And if this be not enough, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> uſeth a larger expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>How much more ſhall your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father give good things to them that ask him</hi>? If there be any thing that is good, and we ſtand in need of it, and earneſtly pray to God for it, we may be confident that he will give it us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ought to be very watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over our ſelves, conſidering our weakneſs and wavering and inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and fickleneſs, the treachery and deceitfulneſs of our own Hearts, and the malice of Satan. It will be a great while before the Habits
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:43767:179"/>
of Sin be ſo weakned and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that we ſhall have no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion to return to them again; ſo that our Hearts will be often endeavouring to return to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer poſture, and <hi>like a deceitful Bow,</hi> which is not firmly ſtrong, <hi>to ſtart back.</hi> And beſides the deceitfulneſs of Sin and our own Hearts, the Devil is very malicious, and his malice will make him vigilant to watch all Advantages againſt us; and his great deſign will be to ſhake our Reſolution; for if that ſtand, he knows his Kingdom will fall, and therefore he raiſeth all his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries againſt this Fort, and labours by all means to undermine it, and nothing will be matter of greater Triumph to him, than to gain a Perſon that was revolted from him, and reſolved to leave his Service. If therefore thou expecteſt God's Grace and Aſſiſtance to keep thee ſtedfaſt to thy Reſolution, do not neglect thy ſelf, but <hi>keep thy Heart with all diligence,</hi> and watch care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully over thy ſelf: for becauſe <hi>God worketh in us both to will and to do,</hi> therefore he expects that <hi>we ſhould
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:43767:180"/>
work out our Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> leſt by our own careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and neglect we ſhould miſcarry.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us frequently renew and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce our Reſolutions, more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when we think of coming to the Sacrament, and approaching the holy Table of the Lord. Nothing is more apt to beget in us good Reſolutions, and to ſtrengthen them, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the dreadful Sufferings of the Son of God for our Sins, which are ſo lively ſet forth and repreſented to us in this holy Sacrament, which as it is on God's part, a Seal and Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Grace and Love to us, ſo on our parts, it ought to be a ſolemn Ratification of our Covenant with God, <hi>to depart from iniquity,</hi> and <hi>to walk before him in holineſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs all the days of our Lives.</hi>

            <p>ONE particular and eminent Fruit of true Repentance, is the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Reſtitution and Satisfaction to thoſe whom we have injured. As for God, we can make no Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Compenſation to him, for
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:43767:181"/>
the injuries we have done him by our Sins;<note place="margin">Vol. 8.</note> all that we can do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God, is to confeſs our Sins to him, to make acknowledgment of our Miſcarriages, to be heartily trroubled for what we have done, and not to do the like for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But for Injuries done to men, we may in many Caſes make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and Satisfaction. And this, as it is one of the beſt ſigns and evidences of a true Repentance; ſo it is one of the moſt proper and genuine effects of it: for this is as much as in us lies, to undo what we have done, and to unſin our Sins.</p>
            <p>But, becauſe the practice of this Duty doth ſo interfere with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of men, and conſequently it will be very difficult to convince men of their Duty in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and to perſwade them to it; therefore I deſign to handle this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Fruit and Effect of a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by it ſelf, from theſe words, which contain in them,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Fruit and Effect of <hi>Zacheus</hi> his Converſion and Repentance; <hi>If
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:43767:181"/>
I have taken any thing from any Man, I reſtore him fourfold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The Declaration which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour makes hereupon, of the truth of his Repentance and Converſion, and the happy ſtate he was thereby put into. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto him, This day is Salvation come to this Houſe, for as much as he alſo is the Son of Abraham</hi>; as if he had ſaid, By theſe Fruits and Effects it appears, that this is a Repentance to Salvation; and this Man whom you look upon as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and a heathen, may by better right call <hi>Abraham Father,</hi> than any of you formal Phariſees and <hi>Jews,</hi> who glory ſo much in being <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Abraham.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Fruit and Effect of <hi>Zacheus</hi>'s Converſion and Repentance; <hi>If,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Zacheus,</hi> as you find at the 2d. <hi>verſe,</hi> was Chief of the Publicans, which was an Office of great Odium and Infamy among the <hi>Jews,</hi> they being the Collectors of the Tribute which the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, under whoſe Power the <hi>Jews</hi> then were,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:43767:182"/>
did exact from them. And becauſe theſe Publicans farmed this Tribute of the Emperour at a certain Rent, they made a gain out of it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by exacting and requiring more of the People than was due upon that account; ſo that their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was very infamous, upon <hi>three</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe they were the Inſtruments of oppreſſing their Country-men; for ſo they looked upon the Tax they paid to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as a great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe they were forced by the Neceſſity of their calling to have familiar Converſation with Heathens, whom they lookt upon as ſinners. Hence the Phraſe uſed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, of <hi>Sinners of the Gentiles.</hi> And hence likewiſe probably it is, that <hi>Publicans and Sinners, Publicans and Heathen,</hi> are joyned ſeveral times together, becauſe of the occaſions of frequent Converſe which the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans had with Heathens.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:43767:182"/>3. But principally they were odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe of the common injuſtice and oppreſſion, which they uſed in the management of their Calling, by fraud and violence extorting more than was due, to inhance the profit of their Places. Hence it is, that this ſort of Officers have been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally branded, and reckoned among the worſt ſort of men. So he in the Comedy, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>all Publicans are Rapacious or Robbers.</hi> And this is moſt probably the Sin which <hi>Zacheus</hi> here repents of, and in regard to which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes Reſtitution, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>And if I have taken any thing from any Man by falſe accuſation</hi>; ſo we render the words in our Tranſlation: but the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies more generally, <hi>If I have been inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to any one, if I have wronged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man,</hi> as appears by the conſtant uſe of this word by the LXX, who by this word do tranſlate the moſt general <hi>Hebrew</hi> words, which ſignifie any kind of Injury or Oppreſſion, either by fraud or violence or calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. So that there is no Reaſon here
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:43767:183"/>
to reſtrain it, to <hi>wronging men by falſe accuſation</hi>: for <hi>Zacheus</hi> his Sin being in all probability extorting more than was due, this might as eaſily be done many other ways, as <hi>by falſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And that this was the common Sin of the Publicans, appears by the Counſel which <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt gives them, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Then came alſo the Publicans to be Baptized, and ſaid unto him, Maſter, what ſhall we do? And he ſaid unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you</hi>; that is, do not by fraud or violence extort from any Man, any more than the Tribute which is laid upon him.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>Zacheus</hi> here promiſeth, that if he had been injurious to any Man in his Office, by extorting more than was due, he would reſtore to him fourfold. And if <hi>Zacheus</hi> calculated his Eſtate right, and intended to reſerve any part of it to himſelf, which is but reaſonable to ſuppoſe; it could be no very great part of his Eſtate which was injuriouſly got; and I am afraid a far ſmaller propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than many are guilty of, who yet paſs for very honeſt men in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:43767:183"/>
of the Publicans. The Text ſaith, he was <hi>a rich Man.</hi> Suppoſe he was worth ten or twelve thouſand Pounds; half he gives to the Poor; That was well got, or elſe his whole Eſtate could not have made fourfold Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution for it. Suppoſe he reſerved a thouſand or two to himſelf, then at the rate of reſtoring <hi>fourfold,</hi> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a thouſand can be injuriouſly got, that is about a Penny in the Shilling. I am afraid that now a-days there are few ſuch moderate Oppreſſors: nay, it is poſſible the proportion of his Eſtate injuriouſly got might be much leſs: more it could not eaſily be. But whatever it was, he does not plead that by way of excuſe for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he freely confeſſeth he had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this kind, and offers Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the utmoſt, much more than the Law did require in ſuch Caſes.</p>
            <p n="2">II. You have the Declaration our Saviour makes hereupon, of the truth of his Repentance and Converſion, and the happy ſtate he was thereby put into, <hi>This day is Salvation come to this Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:43767:184"/>The <hi>Obſervation</hi> I ſhall make from hence is this, That Reſtitution and Satisfaction for the Injuries we have done to others, is a proper and genuine Effect of true Repentance. I know the Text only ſpeaks of Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in Caſe of Oppreſſion and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action: but becauſe there is the ſame Reaſon why Reſtitution ſhould be made for all other Injuries, I think I may without any force or violence to my Text, very well make it the Foundation of a more general Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning Reſtitution.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this, I ſhall,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Open to you the Nature of this Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Confirm the truth of the Propoſition, by ſhewing the Neceſſity of it.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:43767:184"/>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> For the opening the Nature of this Duty, I will conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Act.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Latitude or Extent of the Object, as I may call it, or the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about which it is converſant.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Manner how it is to be done.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Meaſure of it.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The Perſons who are bound to make Reſtitution; and to whom it is to be made.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The time in which it is to be done.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The Order of doing it, where more are injured, and Reſtitution can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made at once to all.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For the Act. Reſtitution is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the making Reparation or Satisfaction to another, for the Injuries we have done him. It is to
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:43767:185"/>
reſtore a Man to the good Condition, from which, contrary to Right and to our Duty, we have removed him. Reſtitution is only done in Caſe of Injury. Another Man may be dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and prejudiced by us many ways, and we not be bound to make Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; becauſe there are many Caſes, wherein a Man deſerves the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice we do to him. As when we are Inſtruments of inflicting upon a Man the Puniſhment which the Law doth Sentence him to. And there are many Caſes wherein we may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to others, and cannot help it. As a Man that is ſick of a Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Diſeaſe, may infect others that are about him: but he is not injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them; becauſe it is not his fault, but his infelicity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. For the Latitude and Extent of the Object, as I may call it, or the matter about which it is Converſant. It extends to all kind of Injuries, which may be reduced to theſe <hi>two</hi> Heads, either we injure a Perſon with or without his conſent.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:43767:185"/>1. Some Injuries are done to Perſons with their Conſent. Such are moſt of thoſe Injuries which are done to the Souls of men, when we command, or counſel, or incourage them to Sin, or draw them in by our Example. For the Maxim <hi>Volenti non fit injuria, There's no injury done to a Man that is willing,</hi> is not ſo to be underſtood, as that a Man may not in ſome ſort conſent to his own wrong: for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute freedom and willingneſs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that a Man is wholly left to himſelf, and that he underſtands fully what he does. And in this Senſe no Man Sins willingly, that is, perfectly knowing and actually conſidering what he does; and Commands, and Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Example are a kind of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: but none of theſe hinder, but that a Man in theſe Caſes may ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently conſent to what he does. But yet he is not ſo perfectly free, as to excuſe him that draws him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sin by theſe ways. So likewiſe when a Man refuſeth to do that which is his Duty without a Reward; for inſtance, to do Juſtice to another; he is injurious in ſo doing: but yet not
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:43767:186"/>
altogether without the conſent of him whom he injures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Injuries are done to Perſons without their conſent. And theſe, tho' are not always the greateſt Michiefs, yet they are the greateſt Injuries. And theſe Injuries are done either by fraud and cunning, or by violence and oppreſſion; either by over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another Man in Wit, or over-bearing him by Power. And theſe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually either reſpect the Bodies of men, or their Eſtates, or their good Name. The Bodies of men. He that maims another, or does him any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Injury in his Limbs or Health, either by fraud or force, is bound, ſo far as he is able, to make Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Injury. Or they reſpect the Eſtates of men. If by cunning, or by violence, or by falſe Teſtimony or Accuſation, thou haſt hinder'd a Man of any Benefit, which otherwiſe would have come to him, thou art bound to Reſtitution. If by thy Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Intereſt, by thy knowledge in the Law, or skill in Buſineſs, thou haſt directly and avowedly helped and aſſiſted another to do Injuſtice
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:43767:186"/>
to his Neighbour, thou art bound to Reſtitution; tho' not as the principal, yet as the acceſſory. If thou haſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-reached thy Brother in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, making Advantage of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or unskilfulneſs; if thou haſt made a gain of his Neceſſity; if thou haſt by thy Power and Intereſt, or by any more violent and forcible way detained his Right, or taken away that which was his; thou art bound to make Reparation for theſe Injuries, to reſtore that which thou haſt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, to return the pledge which thou haſt wrongfully kept, to releaſe unconſcionable Forfeitures, to pay debts, to make ſatisfaction for frauds and cheats, to take off all unjuſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions and ſurprizals of Eſtates: yea tho' the fraud be ſuch that thou art not liable to make ſatisfaction by any Humane Law, yet thou art as much bound to it in Conſcience to God and thy Duty, as if thou hadſt ſtolen it, or taken it by violence from thy Neighbour. For in truth and reality, fraud is as great an Injury as violence, altho' Humane Laws cannot take Cognizance of it, ſo as to relieve e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man that is over-reached in a
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:43767:187"/>
Bargain: nay of the two it is worſe; for whenever thou decieveſt a Man in this kind, thou doſt not only wrong him in Point of Eſtate, but thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſeſt his Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe in reſpect of a Man's Fame and Reputation. If thou haſt hurt any Man's good Name by ſlander or calumny, by falſe witneſs, by rendring him ridiculous, or any other way; thou art bound to give ſuch Satisfaction as the thing is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of; or if there be any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury which I have not mentioned, thou art obliged to make Reparation for it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. As to the manner how Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be made.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou art bound to do it vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, and of thy own accord; tho' the Perſon injured do not know, who it was that did him the Injury, tho' he do not ſeek Reparation by Law. When a Man is forced by Law to make Reſtitution, it is not a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but Neceſſity; this is not a Fruit of Repentance and a good Mind, but
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:43767:187"/>
of good Law. And that thou doſt not do it, unleſs the Law compel thee to it, is an Argument thou wouldſt not have done it, if thou couldſt have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided it. And tho' the thing be done, yet <hi>thou</hi> haſt not done it, but <hi>the Law</hi>; and unleſs thou heartily repent of thy Crime, the Injury ſtill lies at thy Door, and in God's account thou art as guilty as if no Reſtitution had been made. Not that thou art bound in this Caſe to make new Reſtitution over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but thou art bound to bewail thy neglect, that thou didſt not do it voluntarily and without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of the Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thou muſt do it in kind, if the thing be capable of it, and the injur'd Party demand it. Thou muſt reſtore the very thing which thou hadſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived thy Neighbour of, if it be ſuch a thing as can be reſtored, and be ſtill in thy Power; unleſs he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily accept of ſome other thing in exchange.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If thou canſt not reſtore it in kind, thou art bound to reſtore it in
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:43767:188"/>
value, in ſomething that is as good. As for ſpiritual Injuries done to the Souls of men, we are bound to make ſuch Reparation and Compenſation as we can. Thoſe whom we have drawn into Sin, and engaged in wicked Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by our influence and example, or by neglect of our Duty towards them, we are ſo far, as becomes the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we ſtand in to them, to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of our fault, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by our Inſtruction and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to reclaim them from thoſe Sins which we led them into, and <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them out of the ſnare of the Devil</hi>; and ſhould never be at reſt till we have done as much or more for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of their Salvation, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them forwards towards Heaven, as we did contribute before to their Ruin and Deſtruction. If we have violated any ones Chaſtity, we are bound to Marry them, if it was done upon that Condition, and if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it: thou art bound to keep and maintain thoſe Children which are the Fruit of thy Luſt, and to make Reparation to the Perſon whom thou haſt injured, by Dowry or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:43767:188"/>If thou haſt defrauded and injured any Man in his good Name, thou art obliged to make him a Compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by acknowledgment of thy fault, by a ſtudious vindication of him, and by doing him honour and repairing his Credit in all fitting ways. And if the Injury be irreparable (as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens, that we can hardly ſo effectually vindicate a Man, as we can defame him; and it is ſeldom ſeen that thoſe wounds which are given to mens Reputation are perfectly healed) I ſay if the injury be irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, eſpecially if it prove really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to a Man in his Calling and Civil Intereſt; if no other Satisfaction will be accepted, it is to be made in Mony, <hi>which, Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>anſwers all things</hi>; and the rather, becauſe the Reaſon and Equity of humane Laws hath thought fit to aſſign this way of Satisfaction in many Caſes upon Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scandal and Defamation. And whatever the Law would give in any Caſe, if it could be proved, that is the leaſt we are bound in Conſcience to do, when we are guilty to our
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:43767:189"/>
ſelves, tho' the Law cannot take hold of us.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe, if thou haſt wounded a Man, thou art bound to pay the Cure, to repair to him and his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Diſability for his Calling and his way of Livelyhood and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, which he hath contracted by thy injury. And ſo for falſe Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, the real Detriment which comes to him by it, is to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for: and ſo in all other Caſes, the injured Perſon is, ſo far as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to be reſtored to the good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which he was before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. As to the Meaſure and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reſtitution we are to make. <hi>Zacheus</hi> here offers <hi>fourfold,</hi> which was much beyond what any Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in like Caſes. The Meaſure of Reſtitution by the Judicial Law of the <hi>Jews,</hi> did very much vary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the kind and degree of the injury. In ſome Caſes a Man was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to ſimple Reſtitution; but then he was to do it to the full, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.5, 6. And ſo if that which
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:43767:189"/>
is another Man's be <hi>delivered unto his Neighbour to keep, and be ſtolen from him, he is to make Reſtitution thereof,</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>And ſo if a Man borrow ought of his Neighbour, and it be hurt or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he ſhall ſurely make it good,</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>But for all manner of treſpaſſes</hi> by way of <hi>theft, whether it be for Ox, for Aſs, for Sheep, for Rayment, or for any manner of loſt thing, which another chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth to be his, He whom the Judge ſhall condemn, ſhall pay double to his Neighbour,</hi> Ver. 9. that is, if it be of <hi>a living Creature,</hi> if the theft be <hi>found in his Hands alive, whether it be Ox or Aſs, or Sheep, he ſhall reſtore double,</hi> Ver. 4. But if a Man did <hi>ſteal an Ox or a Sheep, and did kill it or ſell it,</hi> he was to reſtore <hi>five Oxen for an Ox, and four Sheep for a Sheep.</hi> And thus we find <hi>David</hi> judged upon <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Parable of the Rich Man, who had taken the Poor Man's only Lamb, and kill'd and dreſt it for a Traveller that came to him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.6. <hi>He ſhall reſtore the Lamb fourfold.</hi> Now the Reaſon of this ſeems to be partly becauſe of the advantage and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe Creatures above any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:43767:190"/>
and partly becauſe when they were once kill'd or alienated, a Man could not without great trouble and difficulty make Diſcovery, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of not diſcovering ſeems to be accounted for in the Reſtitution: but if a Man did voluntarily offer Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, before he was proſecuted, for any thing that was taken by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, or unjuſtly detained from his Neighbour, then he was only <hi>to reſtore the principal, and to add a fifth part thereto, and to offer up an Offering to the Lord,</hi> and ſo <hi>his atonement was made,</hi> Levit. 6.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the higheſt proportion was <hi>a fourth or fifth part,</hi> and that only in the particular Caſe of <hi>Sheep or Oxen ſtolen away, and kill'd or alienated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</hi> Indeed <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of a <hi>ſevenfold</hi> Reſtitution, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.31. Where he ſaith, <hi>If a thief be found, he ſhall reſtore ſevenfold, even all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Houſe</hi>; where <hi>ſeven</hi> is only a number of Perfection, and the meaning is, he ſhall make perfect and full Reſtitution according to the Law, ſo far as his Subſtance or Eſtate will reach.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:43767:190"/>So that it ſeems <hi>Zacheus</hi> in reſtoring <hi>fourfold</hi> did out-do the utmoſt ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Law; which in Caſe of fraud and oppreſſion was but <hi>double,</hi> if deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; if voluntarily offer'd, was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and <hi>a fifth part</hi> added: but to teſtifie the truth of his Repentance, and his hearty Sorrow for the injuries he had done, he puniſheth himſelf beyond what the Law would have done.</p>
            <p>I do not ſay that this Example binds as to this meaſure and proportion: nay, I do not ſay we are bound to the proportions of the Law; for that only concerned the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi>: but altho' we be free from the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Law, yet we are tyed to the <hi>Equity</hi> of it. As to the ſubſtance of the Duty of Reſtitution, we are bound to that by the Law of Nature. As to the Meaſure and Proportion, the Equity of the Judicial Law in its Proportions, and of <hi>Zacheus</hi> his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ought to be conſiderable to us.</p>
            <p>But to ſpeak more particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Meaſures and Proportions
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:43767:191"/>
of Reſtitution, I ſhall lay down theſe Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Where Reſtitution can be made in Kind, or the Injury can be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued, we are to reſtore the thing, or the value.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are bound to reſtore the thing, with the natural increaſe of it, that is, to ſatisfie for the loſs ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mean time, and the gain hinder'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where the thing cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and the value of it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, we are to give reaſonable Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that is, according to a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle eſtimation; not the higheſt, nor the loweſt of things of the kind. The injur'd Perſon can demand no more, and ſtrict Juſtice requires no more. But it is ſafe for him that hath done the injury, rather to exceed than to fall ſhort.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We are at leaſt to give by way of Reſtitution what the Law would give; for that is generally equal, and in
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:43767:191"/>
moſt Caſes rather favourable than ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Man is not only bound to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution for the injury which he did, but for all that directy follows upon his injurious Act, tho' it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his intention. For the firſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being wilful, thou art preſumed to will all that which directly followed upon it; according to that rule, <hi>Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarium ortum ex voluntario cenſetur pro voluntario. We are preſumed to will that which follows upon a voluntary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tho' we did not intend it.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if a Man maliciouſly and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſet fire upon another Man's Houſe, tho' he intended only an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that particular Perſon, yet if a wind come and drive the fire to his Neighbours at ſome diſtance, tho' he did not intend this, yet becauſe the firſt Act was unlawful, he is liable to ſatisfie for all the direct conſequences of it. If a Man wound another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intention of killing him, and the wound prove Mortal, tho' there was no probability that Death would enſue upon it, the Man is bound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt Act was injurious, to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:43767:192"/>
make Reparation to his Relations for the damage they ſuſtain by his Death; and if they did depend ſolely upon him, who died by ſuch injury, thou art bound to maintain them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Becauſe thoſe who have lived in a Trade and Courſe of Injuſtice, can hardly remember all the particular injuries they have done, ſo as to make exact Satisfaction for them, it will not be amiſs over and beſides to give ſomething to the Poor. So <hi>Zacheus</hi> does here, <hi>Half of my Eſtate I give to the Poor, and if I have taken any thing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The Perſons who are concern'd in Reſtitution. And here I ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Perſons who are bound to make Reſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Perſons to whom it is to be made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Perſons who are bound to make Reſtitution. In general, they who have done the injury, or they
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:43767:192"/>
who come into their ſtead, ſo as in Law or Equity the Injury devolves and deſcends upon them. But for the clearer ſtating of this, I ſhall lay down ſeveral Propoſitions, which may ſerve to reſolve a great many Caſes, that may be put concerning Perſons obliged to make Reſtitution.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Injury be done ſolely by one, without Complices and Partakers in the Crime, he alone is reſponſible, and wholly bound to make Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I mean, he only is bound ſo long as he lives, but if the injury deſcend as a burden upon the Eſtate, then he who enjoys the Eſtate becomes bound to make Satisfaction; as I ſhall ſhew afterwards.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Injury was done by more, who did all equally concur to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, they are all equally bound to make Satisfaction; and they are bound to concur together to that Purpoſe; and in Caſe of ſuch concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, every one is not bound to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for the whole, but <hi>pro ratâ parte,</hi> for his ſhare; provided they do among them make full Satisfaction.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:43767:193"/>3. If all will not concur, thoſe that are willing are bound among them to make Reparation for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury: nay, if all the reſt refuſe to joyn with thee in it, thou art bound <hi>in ſolidum</hi> to make full Reparation ſo far as thou art able; becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one was guilty of the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. For inſtance, if four men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire together to cheat a Man, or to rob him, any one of theſe, if the reſt refuſe, is bound to make entire Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; yea, tho' he was only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker in the Benefit; becauſe, as I ſaid before, he is guilty of the whole Injury.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the Injury be done by more, who do unequally concur to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, he that is Principal is chiefly and principally bound to make Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: and here I do not take <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,</hi> ſtrictly in the Senſe of the Law, but in the Senſe of Equity; not for him always who is the more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate cauſe of the Injury, but for him who was the greateſt cauſe, and by whoſe influence chiefly it was procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and done: but if the principal
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:43767:193"/>
will not, the Acceſſories and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are bound, at leaſt for their ſhare, and according to the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Hand they had in it. But if the Principal do ſatisfie in the name, and upon the account of the reſt, then the Acceſſories are free from any Obligation to Reſtitution, and are only bound to Repentance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If the Injury devolve upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, by deſcending as a burden upon the Eſtate, he who enjoys the Eſtate is bound to make Satisfaction. And when Injuries do thus deſcend as Burdens and Incumbrances upon Eſtates, and when not, the Civil Laws of the place where we live muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine: but then where my Caſe falls within the compaſs of the Law, I am bound voluntarily to ſatisfie without the Compulſion of the Law. For inſtance, If an Eſtate fall to me charged with a debt, which hath been unjuſtly detained, I am bound volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily to diſcharge the debt, ſo ſoon as it appears to me, before I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd thereto by the Law.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:43767:194"/>6. As for Perſonal Injuries which do not lie as Burdens upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, nor do by the Law deſcend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Son or Heir, tho' in ſtrict Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice a Man be not bound to make Compenſation for them, for that would be endleſs, <hi>&amp; infinitum in lege repudiatur, No Law can take notice of that which is infinite and endleſs</hi>; for <hi>quae exitum non habent habentur pro im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilibus, Thoſe things which have no end, to which no bounds can be ſet, are eſteemed among things impoſſible,</hi> to which no Man can be obliged: but tho' in ſtrict Juſtice the Heir be not bound to make Reparation, for the Perſonal injuries of him whom he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the Eſtate, yet in many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it is equitable, and generous, and chriſtian, for ſuch Perſons to make ſome kind of Reparation for palpable and notorious Injuries. For inſtance, If I be Heir to an Eſtate, part of which I know certainly was injuriouſly got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, it is not only Chriſtian, but Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to make Satisfaction in the Caſe to the party injur'd, if certainly known; if not, to give it to the Poor;
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:43767:194"/>
for by this means I may take out the <hi>Moth,</hi> which was bred by injuſtice in the Eſtate, and rub off the <hi>Ruſt,</hi> that ſticks to the Gold and Silver, which was got by oppreſſion or fraud, and ſo free the remaining part of the Eſtate from that ſecret and Divine <hi>Nemeſis</hi> which attends it and follows it. And for the ſame Reaſon, it is very Noble and Chriſtian, for the Son and Heir of an unjuſt Father, to make ſome Reparation for his Father's injuries by Reſtitution, if the thing be capable of it: if not, by doing all good Offices to the injured Perſons, which is ſome kind of Compenſation. And in this Caſe the Obligation is greater, becauſe by this means a Man does not only do what in him lies, to cut off <hi>the curſe,</hi> which by his Father's oppreſſion and injuſtice is <hi>intail'd</hi> upon the Family and Eſtate: but likewiſe, becauſe a Son ought much more to be concern'd for his Father, than any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to conſult the Honour and Reputation both of him and his own Family; and the Reparation which the Son makes, is in ſome ſort the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Act, becauſe he ſucceeds him and comes into his ſtead.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:43767:195"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Perſons to whom Satisfaction is is to be made. For the Reſolution of thoſe Caſes which may fall under this Head, I ſhall lay down theſe Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the injured Perſon be certainly known, and be alive and extant, the Satisfaction is to be made to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If he be not alive, or which is all one, not to be found or come at, Satisfaction is to be made to his neareſt Relations, his Wife, or Children, or Brothers, or other neareſt Kindred. The Reaſon is, becauſe Satisfaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing due, and I having no right to keep that which I have injuriouſly gotten, if I cannot reſtore it to the Party him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I ought in all Reaſon to place it there, where I may moſt reaſonably preſume the Party injur'd would have beſtowed his Eſtate, and this part of it among the reſt, had he been poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of it. And by the ſame Reaſon that I am bound thus to reſtore the part of his Eſtate which I have injuriouſly taken or detained from him, I am like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe obliged to give Satisfaction to the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:43767:195"/>
ſame Perſon for any other injury: for to whomſoever I would pay a debt due to one that is deceaſed, to the ſame Perſon I ought to give Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for other injuries, by which a debt is, tho' not formally, yet virtually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the Party injured be not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known, or have no near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions known to me, in that Caſe I think it very adviſeable to give ſo much to the Poor, or to ſome Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uſe: or if the Party injured be not capable of proper Satisfaction, as ſometimes it is a Community and Body of men that we have injured, in this Caſe it is proper to repair the injuries to Communities or Bodies of men, by equivalent good Offices, or by ſome publick good Work, which may be of common Benefit and Advantage. This is the <hi>Fifth</hi> thing I propoſed to ſpeak to, the Perſons concern'd in Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; both the Perſons who are bound to make Reſtitution, and the Perſons to whom it is to be made. Of the reſt hereafter.</p>

            <p n="1">I. The Act.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Extent of it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Manner how it is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Meaſure of it.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The Perſons who are to make Reſtitution; and the Perſons to whom Reſtitution is to be made. I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to conſider,</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The time when Reſtitution is to be made. In theſe Caſes a Man is not tyed up to an inſtant, not juſt to the preſent time, unleſs the Caſe be ſuch, that he can never do it, if he do not do it then. As if a Man lie upon his Death-Bed, that is a Caſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no delay, a Man ſhould haſten Reſtitution, as he would do the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Will, and the diſpoſal of his Eſtate; leſt if he do not do it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, he loſe his opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for ever: but ordinarily, a Man is not ſo ſtrictly tyed up to moments, and to the preſent time. It is, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that a Man be for the preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to do it, ſo ſoon as morally he can, ſo ſoon as he would do other Actions of great moment and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:43767:197"/>
And to this purpoſe the Text gives us an excellent Pattern; <hi>Zache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> the ſame day he repented, took up this Reſolution, and to oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf effectually to put it in Execution, he publickly declares it, and before all the People offers to make Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all whom he had injur'd.</p>
            <p>Therefore take heed of all unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary delays in theſe matters: for tho' God would accept of a firm and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Reſolution in this Caſe, if a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus reſolved ſhould, before he could bring his Reſolution to effect, happen to be cut off by Death, or be otherwiſe render'd incapable of doing it, I ſay, tho' God would accept ſuch a Reſolution as this; yet he will not interpret that to be a ſincere Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which a Man is negligent to put in Practice: for every neglect of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Reſolution in Practice, is a degree of quitting and altering it; and he who did not do what he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to do, when he had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and ability of doing it, is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſumed to have let fall his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
            <p>Therefore let no Man preſume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his good Intention and Reſolution
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:43767:198"/>
in this kind; for they are only accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, ſo far as they are ſincere and real; and they are only ſo far ſincere and real, as the Man that makes them, is ready to put them in Execution, ſo ſoon as morally he can. And if thou careleſly and ſupinely tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle away thy opportunities in this kind, God may likewiſe deprive thee of an opportunity for ever. For all the while thou wilfully neglecteſt to make Reſtitution, thou art guilty of the injury; and there are hardly two Sins that cry louder to God for a quick and ſpeedy revenge, than Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Oppreſſion, Deceit and Fraud. God many times takes ſuch Cauſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his more immediate cognizance, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Let no Man deceive or go beyond his Brother in any thing: for God is the revenger of ſuch.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> tells us, that <hi>God</hi> in a peculiar manner <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors the Blood-thirſty and deceitful Man</hi>; and threatens that <hi>he ſhall not live out half his days.</hi> And God by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.5. tells us, that <hi>He will be a ſwift witneſs againſt the oppreſſors.</hi> And if God be ſo ſwift to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon ſuch Perſons, ſurely then they are concerned to be very
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:43767:198"/>
quick and ſpeedy in making Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their injuries and oppreſſions, leſt Divine Vengeance prevent them, and inſtead of making Reparation to men, they be call'd upon to make Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Juſtice of God; and you know who hath ſaid it, that <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You therefore that have hitherto neglected this Duty, delay it no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; by all means diſcharge your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of this Burden, before you come to lie upon a Death-Bed. Then the Conſciences of the worſt of men begin to work, like a Stomach op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt and ſurcharged with meat; and then they are willing for their eaſe to vomit up thoſe Eſtates, which they have devoured by fraud and injuſtice; then they begin to conſider the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of being ſaved, and to fear that it will be impoſſible for them ever <hi>to enter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> thus laden with the ſpoils of violence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; even thoſe that have the hardeſt and moſt ſeared Conſciences, will be touched with the Senſe of ſuch great Sins at ſuch a time: but do not thou
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:43767:199"/>
defer this work to that time, for theſe <hi>two</hi> Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it cannot be ſo accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, to make Reſtitution at ſuch a time, as when thou art in health and in hopes of longer life. To give a Man his own, when thou canſt enjoy it and uſe it no longer, this is next to detaining of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe in all probability the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution which is then made will not prove ſo effectual. What thou doſt thy ſelf, that thou art ſure is done: but what thou leaveſt to be done by thy Executors, and chargeſt upon them, thou art not ſure will be done; ten to one but if they can find out any trick and evaſion in Law, either to delay or avoid the doing of it, it ſhall either never be done, or very ſlowly. This is the <hi>ſixth</hi> thing, the time when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is to be made.</p>
            <p>But before I leave this Head, there is one Caſe very proper to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, which relates to this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Time, and that is concerning injuries of a very ancient date; that is, how far this Duty of Reſtitution is to look backward, and whether it doth not expire by tr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct of time? For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:43767:199"/>
to this, I ſhall lay down theſe Proportions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. At what diſtance of time ſoever the Law would in the Caſe make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and give Satisfaction, we are undoubtedly bound in Conſcience vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to give it. I deliver this generally; becauſe, tho' it be poſſible ſome Civil Laws may be in ſome Caſes unreaſonable in this matter, yet they are our beſt Rule and Guide; and, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally and for the moſt part, they are as equitable as the Reaſon of Man could deviſe. Not that we are to tie our ſelves ſtrictly to the Law, ſo as not to go farther, if Reaſon and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity require; for, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſt ad legem bonum eſſe, It is no great argument of goodneſs, to be juſt as good as the Law requires.</hi> Therefore I think it will very well become a good Man, in many Caſes, rather to be better than the Law, than to keep ſtrictly to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Caſes where the Law hath not determined the time, we may do well to obſerve a proportion to what the Law hath determined in other Caſes, which come neareſt our own Caſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the injury is ſo old, that the right which the injured Perſon
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:43767:200"/>
had to Reparation is reaſonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be quitted and forſaken, then the Obligation to Satisfaction ceaſeth and expires. The Reaſon is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every Man may recede from his own Right, and give it up to another; and where a Man may reaſonably be preſumed to have parted with his right to another, the Obligation to Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ceaſeth and the right of claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Now <hi>when</hi> a thing begins, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beri pro derelicto,</hi> that is, <hi>when</hi> a right may reaſonably be preſumed to be quitted and forſaken, cannot in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral be determined: but this muſt be eſtimated according to the importance of the right and thing in Controverſie, as whether it be more or leſs conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and according to the Reaſon and Determination of Laws about things of this Nature. To illuſtrate this Rule by inſtances. The <hi>Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> did at ſeveral times invade and conquer this Nation, and conquer'd it we will ſuppoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, and conſequently did hold and poſſeſs that which truly belonged to others, contrary to right; and ſeveral of the Poſterity of each of theſe do probably to this day hold what was
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:43767:200"/>
then injuriouſly gotten; I ſay, in this Caſe, the Obligation to Satisfaction and Reſtitution is long ſince expired, and the Original Title, which thoſe who were diſpoſſeſt had, is reaſonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be long ſince quitted and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken; and that for very wiſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Law and Government; becauſe it would confound and unſettle all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, if every thing, the Original Title whereof is naught, were to be reſtored; and it is but equal to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that all Mankind are ſo reaſonable, as to quit their right in ſuch Caſes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to cauſe endleſs diſturbances, and to have the guilt of Injuſtice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly perpetuated. And tho' it be a rule in Civil Law, that <hi>Vitioſum initio, tractu temporis non convaleſcit, A Title originally bad can never by time be made juſt</hi>; it is only true thus far, that time in it ſelf doth not alter the Nature of things: but conſidering the neceſſities of the World, and the infinite difficulties of retrieving an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Right, and the inconveniences and diſturbances that would thereby redound to Humane Society, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that an injury ſhould be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, than that a great inconvenience
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:43767:201"/>
ſhould come by endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs it; ſo that altho' conſidering a thing ſimply in it ſelf, an injury is ſo far from being leſſened or null'd by tract of time, that it is increaſed, and the longer it continues, the greater it is; yet by accident, and in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the neceſſity of things, length of time may give a right to that which was at firſt injuriouſly poſſeſt. <hi>Judg.</hi> 11.26. Thus <hi>Jephthah</hi> reaſons with the King of <hi>Ammon,</hi> who had made War for recovery of an ancient Right, as he ſuppos'd. And tho' the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I have given of the unjuſt Conqueſt of a Nation be great and publick; yet the ſame is to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined proportionably in leſs and particular Caſes. And thus I have done with the <hi>ſixth</hi> thing.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> As to the order of Reſtitution. When we have injur'd a great many, and are not able to make Reſtitution to all at once, our beſt Prudence and Diſcretion muſt govern us herein. Becauſe no certain Rule can be given, which will reach all Caſes, I will only ſay this in general, that it is reaſonable firſt to make Reparation for the oldeſt and greateſt injuries;
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:43767:201"/>
and <hi>ceteris paribus,</hi> if all other Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations be equal, to conſider thoſe firſt, who are moſt neceſſitous, and if there be any other ſpecial Reaſon and Obligation ariſing from the Nature of the injury, or the Circumſtances of the Perſon injur'd, to have regard to them. I come now in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> place, To confirm the truth of the Propoſition, That to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and Satisfaction to thoſe whom we have injured, is a proper and neceſſary Fruit of a true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And this will appear, if we conſider theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Our Obligation to this Duty.</item>
               <item>II. The Nature of Repentance.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. Our Obligation to this Duty. Upon the ſame account that we are obliged to Repentance, we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Reſtitution; and both theſe Obligations ariſe from natural Equity and Juſtice. All Sin is an injury done; and tho' Repentance be not ſtrictly Satisfaction, yet it is the beſt we can make; and he is unjuſt, who having done an injury, does not make the beſt Reparation he can. But now there are ſome Sins, in which, beſides the injury that is done to God by
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:43767:202"/>
them, upon the general account, as they are Sins and Violations of his Laws, there is likewiſe a particular injury done to men; and ſuch are all thoſe, the effect whereof redounds to the prejudice of other men: ſuch are fraud and oppreſſion, and all other Sins whereby others are injured. So that in theſe kinds of Sins, there are two things conſiderable, the irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and viciouſneſs of the Act, and the evil Effects of it upon other men: the former reſpects the Law, and calls for Sorrow and Repentance for our Violation of it; the latter reſpects the Perſon that is injured, and calls for Satisfaction and Reſtitution. So that our Obligation to Reſtitution is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the immutable and indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Law of Nature, which is <hi>To do that to another, which we would have another do to us.</hi> We would have no Man be injurious to us, or if he have been ſo, we would have him make Satisfaction and Reparation to us of the injury he hath done; and we take it grievouſly from him, if he do not. Now nothing is more juſt and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than that we ſhould do that to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which we in the like Caſe
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:43767:202"/>
would expect from them: for the very ſame obligation that lies upon others towards us, does lie upon us in regard to others.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This will yet further appear, if we conſider the Nature of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which is to be ſorry for what we have done, and not to do the like for the future. Now if thou be ſorry for what thou haſt done, thou wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt with all thy heart thou hadſt not done it; and if thou doſt ſo, thou wilt undo, as much as in thee lieth, what thou haſt done. Now the beſt way to undo an injury, is to make Reparation for it; and till we do this, we continue in the Sin. For if it was a Sin, to do the injury at firſt, it is the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, not to make Satisfaction; and we do not ceaſe to commit the Sin, ſo long as we detain that, which is another's Right. Nothing but Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can ſtop the progreſs of Sin: for if it be a Sin to take that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man's from him by fraud or violence, it is the ſame continued and virtually repeated, to detain and keep it from him; and nothing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Repentance, than to continue in the Sin thou pretendeſt to repent

of. For how art thou ſorry for doing of it, if thou continueſt to do it; if thou wilt go on to do it and do it again? How doſt thou hate thy Sin, if thou enjoy the Benefit and reap the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it? If thou doſt this, it is an Argument thou loveſt the Sin ſtill: for thou didſt never love it for it ſelf, but for the Profit of it, and ſo long as thou retaineſt that, thou canſt not be quit of the Sin. Thou holdeſt faſt thy Sin, ſo long as thou refuſeſt to make Satisfaction for it; and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance without Reſtitution differs as much from true Repentance, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in Sin does from the forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. <hi>Si res aliena non redditur, non agitur poenitentia, ſed fingitur</hi>; ſo St. <hi>Auguſtine; If we do not reſtore that, which we have injuriouſly detained from another, our Repentance is not real, but feigned and hypocritical,</hi> and will not be effectual to the obtaining of our Pardon. 'Tis a very common, but a true and terrible ſaying, <hi>Non dimitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur peccatum, niſi reſtituatur ablatum, No Remiſſion without Reſtitution.</hi> If we will inherit the Profit and Advantage of Sin, we cannot think it unreaſonable
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:43767:203"/>
or unjuſt that we ſhould inherit the Puniſhment of it.</p>
            <p>When the Scripture ſpeaks of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, it frequently mentions Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as a proper Fruit and Effect of it, and as a neceſſary and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Condition of Pardon and Life. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.14, 15, 16. <hi>Again, when I ſay unto the wicked, Thou ſhalt ſurely die: if he turn from his ſin, and do that which is lawful and right; if the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſtore the pledge, give again that he had robbed,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, when I denounce Death and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the wicked, there is but this one way to eſcape it, and that is by Repentance; but then take notice, what a Repentance it is, that will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to this end; it is not a bewailing our ſelves, and lamenting over our Sins, but a forſaking of them and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to our Duty; <hi>If we turn from our ſin, and do that which is lawful and right.</hi> For inſtance, if he have been guilty of Injuſtice and Oppreſſion; if he leave his Courſe, and deal juſtly and righteouſly with his Neighbour, and not only ſo, but he alſo make Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution for the injury he hath done, and reſtore what he hath unjuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:43767:204"/>
and taken away; <hi>If he reſtore the pledge, and give again that he hath rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,</hi> and do no Injuſtice for the future, but <hi>walk in the Statutes of Life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out committing iniquity,</hi> upon theſe Terms and no other <hi>he ſhall live, he ſhall not die.</hi> Yea the very light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could ſuggeſt. thus much to the People of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> that there was no hope, without this Fruit of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, of appeaſing God's wrath. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King and the Princes, after all the external ſolemnity of <hi>faſting,</hi> and <hi>ſackeloth,</hi> and <hi>crying mightily,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree that <hi>Every one ſhould turn from the evil of his ways, and from the violence that was in their Hands, ut rapinâ ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus vacuefaciat, &amp; rapta reſtituat, ſine quo non eſt vera poenitentia</hi>; ſo <hi>Grot.</hi> upon the place, <hi>That he empty his hands of the ſpoils of rapine and oppreſſion,</hi> that is, <hi>that he make Reſtitution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there can be no Repentance</hi>: And upon their doing this, 'tis ſaid, that <hi>God ſpared them,</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>And God ſaw their works, that they turned from their evil ways.</hi> 'Tis not ſaid, that he ſaw their faſting and ſackcloth, but <hi>He ſaw their works,</hi> the real Fruits and Effects of their Repentance; and upon
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:43767:204"/>
this it was that <hi>God repented of the evil he ſaid, he would do to them, and he did it not.</hi> And elſewhere we find, that God ſpeaks with great Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moſt ſolemn Repentance, which is not accompanied with this Fruit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3, 4, 5, 6. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tell God how <hi>they had faſted and afflicted their Soul, and made their voice to be heard on high</hi>: but God deſpiſeth all this, becauſe it was not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with this Fruit of Repentance, <hi>Is it ſuch a faſt as I have choſen</hi>? &amp;c. There is ſo much of natural Juſtice and Equity in Reſtitution, and it is ſo proper a Fruit of Repentance, that as <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves, it is not only the Doctrine of the <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians, but of Heathens and <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> that the Repentance which doth not produce this Fruit is feigned, and will never avail with God for Pardon and Mercy. Thus much for Confirmation of this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> thing I propos'd was to perſwade to the Practice of this Duty; and this may ſerve by way of Application of the Doctrine of Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The uſe we ſhould make of it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To perſwade men to the Practice of this difficult Duty. I doubt
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:43767:205"/>
not but the Arguments I have uſed are ſufficient to convince us of the Equity and Neceſſity of Reſtitution; but what Arguments ſhall I uſe to perſwade to the Practice and Exerciſe of it? When we preſs men to their Duty, tho' we have ſome Advantages on our ſide, yet we have alſo great diſadvantages. We have this Advantage, that we have the Reaſon and Conſciences of men on our ſide: but then we have this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, that we have to contend ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Luſts or Intereſts of men, or both: now that theſe are uſually more powerful, is evident, in that the Luſts and Intereſts of men do ſo frequently byaſs and draw them to do things contrary to Reaſon and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. When we perſwade men to be juſt, and to make Reſtitution to thoſe whom they have injur'd, 'tis true we have not to contend with the Luſts of men, with any corrupt and vicious Inclination of Nature. There are ſome Sins that have their riſe from mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tempers, as Paſſion and Luſt, and thoſe ſenſual vices that abound in the World: but there's nothing in any Man's natural Temper and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that inclines him to be unjuſt, no Man's Complexion doth particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:43767:205"/>
diſpoſe him to lie or ſteal, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud his Neighbour, or detain his Right from him; it is only the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of men that prompt them to theſe Sins; and they are upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the more inexcuſable, becauſe no Man is inclined to theſe Sins from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Temper and Conſtitution; ſo that an unjuſt Man is in ordinary Caſes and circumſtances a greater Sinner, than a Drunkard or a Luſtful Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Man can pretend to be hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away by the ſtrong Propenſion and Inclination of his Nature, to cheat his Brother: but altho' when we perſwade men to be juſt, we have not the Luſts of Men to contend withal, yet we have another powerful Adverſary, and that is the Intereſts of men, which is one of the Chief <hi>Rulers and Governours of this World</hi>; ſo that when we preſs men to Reſtitution, we touch them in their Intereſt, which is a very touchy and tender thing; when we tell them that without Reſtitution no Man can repent and be ſaved, they think this to be <hi>a very hard ſaying,</hi> and they know not <hi>how to bear it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But certainly it hath all the Reaſon and Equity in the World on its ſide. If it be ſo hard for them to reſtore that
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:43767:206"/>
which is another Man's, is it not much harder for him whom thou haſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, to loſe that which is his own? Make it thine own Caſe; wouldſt thou not think it much harder to have thy right detained from thee by another, than for another to part with that which is not his own?</p>
            <p>But I am ſenſible how little it is, that Reaſon will ſway with men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Intereſt; therefore the beſt Argument that I can uſe will be to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie men, that upon a true and juſt account, it is not ſo much their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, to retain what they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly got, as to make Reſtitution. And this I ſhall do by ſhewing men, that to make Reſtitution is their true Intereſt, both in reſpect of themſelves, and of their Poſterity.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In reſpect of themſelves. It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both in reſpect of our preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in this World, and of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of our preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in this World, and that both in reſpect of our outward Eſtate, and our inward Peace and Tranquility.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In reſpect of our outward E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. If we have any belief of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, that his Bleſſing can
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:43767:206"/>
proſper an Eſtate, and his Curſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it and make it moulder away, we cannot but judge it highly our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to clear our Eſtates of Injuſtice by Reſtitution; and by this means to free them from God's Curſe. For if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Eſtate be unjuſtly gotten, it is enough to draw down God's Curſe upon all that we have; it is like a moth in our Eſtate, which will inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly conſume it; it is like a ſecret Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which will diffuſe it ſelf through the whole; like a little Land <hi>in Capite,</hi> which brings the whole Eſtate into <hi>Wardſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hear how God threatens to blaſt Eſtates unjuſtly gotten, <hi>Job</hi> 20.12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> concluding with theſe words, <hi>This is the portion of a wicked Man,</hi> that is, of an unjuſt Man, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.11. <hi>As a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge ſitteth on Eggs, and hatcheth them not, ſo he that getteth Riches and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midſt of his days, and at his end ſhall be a fool.</hi> Men many times live to ſee the folly of their Injuſtice and Oppreſſion, and their Eſtates wither away before their Eyes, and by the juſt revenge of God, they are deprived of them in the midſt of their days. So that the beſt way to fix an Eſtate, and to ſecure it to our
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:43767:207"/>
ſelves, is by Reſtitution to free it from God's Curſe; and when we have done that, how much ſoever we may diminiſh our Eſtate by it, we may look upon our ſelves as having a better E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate than we had; better, becauſe we have God's Bleſſing with that which remains. If we believe the Bible, we cannot doubt of this. The Spirit of God tells us this from the Obſervation of the wiſeſt men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.16. <hi>A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that a righteous Man hath, is better than the riches of many wicked.</hi> Prov. 16.8. <hi>Better is a little with righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than great Revenues without Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) In reſpect of inward Peace and Tranquillity, it is highly our Intereſt to make Reſtitution. No man can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy an Eſtate, that does not enjoy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and nothing puts a Man more out of the Poſſeſſion of himſelf, than an unquiet Conſcience; and there are no kind of Sins lie heavier upon a Man's Conſcience, than thoſe of Injuſtice; becauſe they are committed againſt the cleareſt natural Light, and there's the leaſt natural Temptation to them. They have theſe two great Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they are Sins moſt againſt knowledge, and have moſt of Will in them. There needs no Revelation to
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:43767:207"/>
convince men of Sins of Injuſtice and Oppreſſion; every Man hath thoſe Principles born with him, which will ſufficiently acquaint him, that he ought not to be Injurious to another. There's nothing that relates to our Duty, that a Man can know with greater certainty than this, that Injuſtice is a Sin. And as it is a Sin moſt againſt knowledge, ſo it hath moſt of Will in it. Men are hurried away to other Sins by the ſtrong and violent Propenſions of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but no Man is inclined by his Temper and Conſtitution, to Fraud and Oppreſſion; and the leſs there is of Nature in any Sin, there's the leſs of Neceſſity, and conſequently it is the more voluntary. Now the greater the Aggravations of any Sin are, the greater is the guilt; and the greater the guilt is, the more unquiet our Conſciences will be: ſo that if thou have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Intereſt of thine own Peace, if that be conſiderable to thee, which to wiſe men is the moſt valuable thing in the World, do not for a little wealth continue in thoſe Sins, which will create perpetual diſturbance to thee, and imbitter all the Pleaſures of thy Life. Hear how <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes the Condition of the wicked oppreſſors in
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:43767:208"/>
the place before cited, <hi>Job.</hi> 20.12, &amp;c. <hi>He ſhall not rejoyce in them, becauſe he hath oppreſſed, becauſe he hath violently taken away a Houſe which he builded not, ſurely he ſhall not feel quietneſs in his belly,</hi> that is, he ſhall have no inward Peace and Contentment in the midſt of all his outward Enjoyments; but his ill-gotten Eſtate will work in his Conſcience, and gripe him, as if a Man had taken down Poyſon into his Belly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But chiefly, In reſpect of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Eſtate in another World, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man's Intereſt to make Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Without Repentance we are ruined for ever, and without Reſtitution no Repentance. <hi>No unrighteous Man hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi> If thou continue in thy fraud and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and carry theſe Sins with thee into another World, they will hang as a Millſtone about thy Neck, and ſink thee into eternal Ruine. He that wrongeth his Brother hateth him, and <hi>he that hateth his Brother is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, and ye know that no murderer hath eternal Life abiding in him,</hi> 1 John 3.15. Rom. 1.18. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goldlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</hi> So that if it be mens Intereſt to eſcape the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:43767:208"/>
wrath of God, it concerns us to make Reparation for thoſe Injuries which will expoſe us to it. That is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Text, <hi>James</hi> 5.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miſeries that ſhall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments moth-eaten: Your Gold and Silver is canker'd, and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire: ye have heaped trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure together for the laſt days. Behold! the Hire of the labourers which have reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down your Fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them which have reaped, are enter'd into the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth.</hi> Do not by <hi>detaining the treaſures of wickedneſs, treaſure up to your ſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath</hi>: do not make your ſelves <hi>Miſerable for ever,</hi> that you may be <hi>Rich for a little while:</hi> do not for a little <hi>Silver and Gold,</hi> forfeit <hi>the eternal inheritance,</hi> which was <hi>not purchaſed with corruptible things, but with the precious Blood of the Son of God:</hi> And if this Conſideration, which is the weightieſt in the World, will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with men, I can only ſay with the Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. <hi>He that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill,</hi> let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:43767:209"/>
in his Injuſtice at his Peril, and remember what is added at the 12th <hi>verſe, Behold! I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every Man according as his work ſhall be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. In reſpect of our Children and Poſterity, it is greatly our intereſt to make Reſtitution. God many times ſuffers an Eſtate got by oppreſſion to proſper for a little while: but there is a curſe attends it, which deſcends upon the Eſtate like an incumbrance; and Parents many times, when they think they entail an Eſtate, they entail Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty upon their Children. <hi>Job</hi> 20.10. ſpeaking of the Children of the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, he ſaith, <hi>His Children ſhall ſeek to pleaſe the Poor, and his hands ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore their Goods.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> 21.19. <hi>God layeth up his iniquity for his Children.</hi> Thou layeſt up Riches for thy Children; and <hi>God lays up thine iniquity</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice <hi>for them,</hi> the Curſe that belongs to them. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. <hi>Wo to him that coveteth an evil covetouſneſs, or gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an evil gain to his Houſe,</hi> &amp;c. Thou thoughteſt to raiſe thy Family by thoſe ways; but <hi>thou haſt conſulted ſhame to thy Houſe.</hi> No ſuch effectual way to Ruine thy Family, as Injuſtice and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. As then you would not tranſmit
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:43767:209"/>
a Curſe to your Children, and devolve Miſery upon your Family, free your Eſtates from the burden and weight of what is other mens, leſt by God's juſt Judgment and ſecret Providence, that little which you injuriouſly detain from others, carry away your whole Eſtate to them and their Family. God's Providence many times makes abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Reſtitution, when we will not.</p>
            <p>Having now endeavoured to ſatisfie men, that it is their trueſt Intereſt, to make Reſtitution for the injuries they have done to others, it remains only that I ſhould anſwer an Objection or two, which men are apt to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Men ſay they are aſhamed to do it. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not matter of ſhame, but of Praiſe and Commendation. But it may be thou wilt ſay, It is matter of ſhame to have injured another, and this is the way to lay open thy ſhame. Indeed if the injury were publick, the Reſtitution ought to be ſo too, as the only way to take off the ſhame of the injury. For thy Reſtitution doth not in this Caſe publiſh thy ſhame, but thy honeſty: but if the injury was private, thou may'ſt preſerve thy own Credit, by concealing thy ſelf, and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:43767:210"/>
provided thou do the thing effectually, thou may'ſt be as prudent, as to the manner of doing it, as thou pleaſeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Objection is the prejudice it will be to mens Eſtates. But this I have anſwer'd already, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is more their Intereſt to make Reſtitution, than to continue in the Sin. I ſhall only add, that, as our Saviour reaſons in another Caſe, <hi>It is profitable for thee, that one of thy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhould periſh, rather than that thy whole Body ſhould be caſt into Hell</hi>: 'tis true likewiſe here, it is profitable for thee, that thou ſhouldſt go a Beggar to Heaven, rather than that thou ſhouldſt go to Hell, laden with the ſpoils and Guilt of Rapine and Injuſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The laſt Objection that I ſhall mention, is diſſability to make Reſtitution. This indeed is ſomething; where nothing is to be had, every Man muſt loſe his Right: but then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that there muſt be a hearty Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the Sin; and thy Sorrow muſt be ſo much greater, by how much thy ability to make Reſtitution is leſs; and there muſt be a willing Mind, a firm Purpoſe and Reſolution of doing it, when God ſhall enable thee, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent endeavours to that purpoſe. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:43767:210"/>
the Law thoſe who were not able to make Reſtitutution, were ſold for ſix years, if their ſervice did not make Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in leſs time. 'Tis true indeed, the moderation of the Goſpel doth not ſuffer Chriſtians to deal ſo hardly with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: but if the Goſpel remit of this rigor, and do not allow Chriſtians to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange it, we ſhould voluntarily do in effect that which they were forced to, that is, we ſhould uſe our beſt endeavours and diligence to put our ſelves into a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of making Satisfaction; and we ſhould not look upon any thing beyond the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conveniences of Life, as our own, till we have done it; unleſs the Party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured will recede from his Right, in whole or in part. For tho' the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the thing do diſcharge us for the preſent, yet the Obligation ſtill lies upon us to do it, ſo ſoon as we are able.</p>
            <p>And here it will be proper to conſider the Caſe of thoſe, who have compounded with their Creditors for a ſmall part, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be in Conſcience and Equity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from the whole debt. I am loth to lay unneceſſary Burdens upon mens Conſciences, therefore I am very tender in reſolving ſuch Caſes: but I ought to have a more tender care of the Souls of men, than of their Eſtates: therefore to
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:43767:211"/>
deal plainly, and to diſcharge my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this matter, I think ſuch Perſons do, notwithſtanding the Compoſition, ſtand obliged in Equity and Conſcience for the whole debt, and are bound to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it, ſo ſoon as they can with tolerable Convenience. My Reaſon is, becauſe, tho' they be diſcharged in Law, yet the Law does not intend to take off the Obligation of Conſcience or Equity, which they are under; but leaves that as it found it. Thus the Caſe ſtands; men who are in a way of Trade are engaged by the neceſſities of their calling, to venture a great part of their Eſtate in other mens Hands, and by this means become liable many times to be undone without their own fault; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is uſual, when any Man in a way of Trade becomes diſabled, for the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors to make ſuch a Compoſition with him, as his Eſtate will bear, and upon this Compoſition to give him a full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, ſo as that they cannot afterwards by Law require of him the remainder of their debt. Now tho' this be a favour to the debtor, yet it is principally intended for the benefit of the Creditor; becauſe it being his Act, it is to be preſumed, that he intended it as much as may be, for his own Advantage; and ſo it is, for the Creditor hath as much Satisfaction at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:43767:211"/>
as can be had, and the debtor is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by left in a capacity of recovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again by his induſtry and diligence, which could not be, if he were not fully diſcharged; for if he were ſtill liable for the reſt, he would continually be obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Impriſonment, which would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him incapable of following his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; or if he were at liberty, he could have no Credit to enable him to do any thing in his calling; for who would truſt a Man with any thing, who is liable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment to have it taken from him? So that the Reaſon of this plenary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge is this, that men, who are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hopeful, and in a fair probability of recovering themſelves, may not be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd incapable of getting an Eſtate after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, whereby they may ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and diſcharge their debts. Now this diſcharge being given in order to theſe ends, it cannot be imagined that it ſhould be intended to defeat them; but it is in all Reaſon to be ſuppoſed, that the Creditors did not intend to take off the Obligation of Equity and Conſcience, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to put the Man into a Condition of doing ſomthing towards the enabling him to diſcharge his debt. So that unleſs it were expreſt at the Compoſition, that the Creditor would never expect more from
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:43767:212"/>
him, upon account of Equity and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but did freely forgive him the reſt, the contrary whereof is uſually done, I ſay, unleſs it were thus expreſt, there's no Reaſon, why the Creditor's favour in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Compoſition ſhould be abuſed to his prejudice, and why a legal diſcharge, given him on purpoſe for this Reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, to put him into a capacity of recovering himſelf and giving full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, ſhould be ſo interpreted, as to extinguiſh the equitable right of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor to the remainder of his debt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Uſe of this Doctrine of Reſtitution ſhould be by way of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that men would take heed of being injurious, and ſo take away the occaſion of Reſtitution, and free themſelves from the Temptation of not performing ſo difficult and ſo unwelcome a Duty. It is much eaſier of the two, not to cozen or oppreſs thy Neighbour, than after thou haſt done it, it will be to bring thy ſelf to make Reſtitution: therefore we ſhould be very careful, not to be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to any one in any kind; neither immediately by our ſelves, nor by aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aſſiſting others, by our Power and Intereſt, or skill in the Law, or by any other way, to do injuſtice.</p>

            <p>THIS Chapter is call'd <hi>Moſes</hi> his Song, in which he briefly recounts the various Providences of God toward the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the froward Carriage of that People towards him.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He puts them in mind how God had choſen them for his peculiar People, and had by a ſignal Care and Providence conducted them all that tedious Journey, for the ſpace of fourty
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:43767:213"/>
years in the Wilderneſs,<note place="margin">Vol. 8.</note> till he had brought them to the promiſed Land, which they had now begun to take Poſſeſſion of.</p>
            <p>And then he foretels, how they would behave themſelves after all this mercy and kindneſs God had ſhewn to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Jeſurun waxed fat, and kicked, and forſook God which made him, and lightly eſteemed the Rock of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Upon this he tells them, God would be extremely diſpleaſed with them, and would multiply his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them, <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. <hi>When the Lord ſaw it, he abhorred them, becauſe of the provoking of his Sons and of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; And he ſaid, I will hide my face from them, I will ſee what their end ſhall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no Faith.</hi> And ver. 23. <hi>I will heap miſchief upon them, I will ſpend mine arrows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</hi> And then enumerates the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Judgments which he would ſend upon them: nay, he declares he would have utterly conſumed them, but that he was loth to give occaſion of ſo much Triumph to his and their Enemies, <hi>ver.</hi> 26, 27. <hi>I ſaid, I would ſcatter them into corners, I would make the
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:43767:213"/>
remembrance of them to ceaſe from among men; were it not, that I feared the wrath of the enemy, leſt their adverſary ſhould behave themſelves ſtrangely, and leſt they ſhould ſay our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this.</hi> And he adds the Reaſon of all this ſeverity; becauſe they were ſo very ſtupid and inconſiderate, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>For they are a Nation void of Counſel, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the concluſion of all, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents God as it were breaking out into this vehement and affectionate Wiſh, <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end</hi>!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this.</hi> What is that? <hi>This</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to all that went before, O that they were wiſe to conſider what God had done for them, and what they had done againſt him, and what he will do againſt them, if they continue or renew their former Provocations! O that they were but duly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of <hi>this,</hi> and would lay it ſeriouſly to heart!</p>
            <p>But from what follows, it ſeems more particularly to refer to thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:43767:214"/>
Judgments, which God had threatned them withal, and which would certainly befal them, if they ſtill continued in their diſobedience. <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end!</hi> That is, the ſad conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theſe their Provocations, that by the Conſideration thereof, they might prevent all thoſe Evils and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, by turning from thoſe Sins which would unavoidably bring them upon them.</p>
            <p>From the words thus explained, I ſhall obſerve theſe <hi>four</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That God doth really and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire the Happineſs of men, and to prevent their Miſery and Ruin. For the very deſign of theſe words is to expreſs this to us, and it is done in a very ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, and, as I may ſay, paſſionate manner.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That it is a great point of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to conſider ſeriouſly the laſt Iſſue and Conſequence of our Actions, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they tend, and what will follow upon them. And therefore wiſdom is here deſcribed by <hi>the Conſideration of our latter end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. That this is an excellent means
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:43767:214"/>
to prevent that Miſery, which will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe befall us. And this is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily implyed in this wiſh, that if they would but conſider theſe things, they might be prevented.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That the want of this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is the great cauſe of mens Ruin. And this is likewiſe implyed in the words, that one great reaſon of mens Ruin is, becauſe they are not ſo wiſe, as to conſider the fatal Iſſue and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a ſinful Courſe. I ſhall ſpeak briefly to each of theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That God doth really and heartily deſire the Happineſs of men, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their Miſery and Ruin. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this to us, God doth put on the vehemency of a Humane Paſſion, <hi>O that they were wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. The Laws of God are a clear evidence of this; becauſe the obſervance of them tends to our Happineſs. There is no good Prince makes Laws with any other deſign, than to promote the publick Welfare and Happineſs of his People: and with much more Reaſon may we imagine, that the infinite good God does by all his Laws deſign the Happineſs of his Creatures. And the Exhortations of Scripture, by which he enforceth his
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:43767:215"/>
Laws, are yet a greater evidence how earneſtly he deſires the Happineſs of his Creatures. For it ſhews that he is concerned for us, when he uſeth ſo many Arguments to perſwade us to our Duty, and when he expoſtulates ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently with us for our neglect of it, ſaying to Sinners, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die, O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael? <hi>Ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life,</hi> ſays our Bleſſed Saviour, with great trouble to ſee men ſo obſtinately ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own Happineſs; and again, <hi>How often would I have gathered you, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, and ye would not.</hi> And to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us yet farther, that it is his real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, by our obedience to his Laws, to prevent our Ruine, God does frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Scripture put on the Paſſions of men, and uſe all ſorts of vehement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to this purpoſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.29. <hi>O that there were ſuch a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their Children for ever!</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.13. <hi>O that my People had hearkned unto me, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>had walked in my ways! I ſhould ſoon have ſubdued their enemies, and turned
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:43767:215"/>
my hand againſt their Adverſaries.</hi> Jer. 13.27. <hi>O</hi> Iſrael! <hi>Wilt thou not be made clean? When ſhall it once be?</hi> And to name but one Text more, when our bleſſed Saviour wept over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> how paſſionately does he wiſh, that <hi>She had known in that her day, the things which belonged to her Peace!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if after all this, we can doubt whether the faithful God means as he ſays, he hath for our farther aſſurance, and to put the matter out of all doubt, confirmed his word by an Oath, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that the wicked turn from his ways and live. Turn ye, turn ye, from your evils ways; for why will ye die, O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael? So that if words can be any Declaration of a hearty and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere deſire, we have no Reaſon to doubt, but that God does really deſire the Happineſs of men, and would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevent their Ruin and Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>If any now ask, why then are not all men Happy? Why do they not eſcape Ruin and Deſtruction? And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly why the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for whom God here makes this wiſh, did not eſcape thoſe Judgments which
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:43767:216"/>
were threatned; the Prophet ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for me, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>O</hi> Iſrael! <hi>thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf.</hi> And <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 81.11. <hi>My people would not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to my voice,</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me.</hi> And our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>How often would I have gathered thee, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life.</hi> You ſee what account the Scripture plainly gives of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it reſts upon the wills of men, and God hath not thought fit to force Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs upon men, and to make them wiſe and good whether they will or no. He preſents men with ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and offers ſuch Arguments to their Conſideration, as are fit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with reaſonable men, and is ready to afford them all neceſſary aſſiſtance, if they be not wanting to themſelves: but if they will not <hi>be wiſe</hi> and <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> if they will ſtand out againſt all the Arguments that God can offer, if they will <hi>receive the grace of God in vain,</hi> and <hi>reſiſt his bleſſed Sptrit,</hi> and <hi>reject the counſel of God againſt themſelves,</hi> God hath not in this Caſe engaged himſelf to provide any remedy againſt the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:43767:216"/>
and perverſeneſs of men, but <hi>their Deſtruction is of themſelves,</hi> and <hi>their blood ſhall be upon their own Heads.</hi> And there is no nicety and intricacy in this matter; but if men will conſider Scripture and Reaſon impartially, they will find this to be the plain Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Caſe.</p>
            <p>So that no Man hath Reaſon to charge either his Fault, or his Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon God; he is <hi>free from the Blood of all Men</hi>; he ſincerely deſires our Happineſs: but we wilfully ruin our ſelves; and when he tells us, that <hi>He deſires not the death of a ſinner, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he ſhould turn from his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and live</hi>; that <hi>He would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the know-of the truth,</hi> that <hi>He is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance,</hi> he plainly means as he ſays, and doth not ſpeak to us with any reſerve, or dark diſtinction between his <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>revealed</hi> Will, he does not decree one thing, and declare another.</p>
            <p>And if this be ſo, no Man hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be diſcouraged from attempting and endeavouring his own Happineſs, upon a jealouſie and ſurmiſe that God hath by any fatal decree put a Bar to
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:43767:217"/>
it from all eternity: for if he had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely reſolved to make the greateſt part of Mankind miſerable, without any reſpect to their Actions in this World, he would never have ſaid, that <hi>He deſires that all ſhould be ſaved</hi>; he would not have exhorted all men <hi>to work out their own Salvation</hi>; had he taken up any ſuch Reſolution, he would have declared it to all the World: for he hath Power enough in his Hands, <hi>to do what he pleaſeth, and none can reſiſt his Will</hi>; ſo that he did not need to have diſſembled the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to have pretended a deſire to ſave men, when de was reſolved to ruin them.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Firſt,</hi> that God doth really and heartily deſire the Happineſs of men, and to prevent their Miſery and Ruin. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. That it is a great part of wiſdom to conſider ſeriouſly the laſt Iſſue and Conſequence of our Actions, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Courſe of Life which we lead does tend, and what will follow upon it. And therefore <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by <hi>Conſideration, O that they were wiſe, that they would conſider their latter end</hi>! that is, what will befal them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:43767:217"/>
what will be the Iſſue and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of all the Sins and Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they are guilty of.</p>
            <p>And this is a principal Point and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of wiſdom, to look forward, and not only to conſider the preſent Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Advantage of any Action, but the future Conſequence of it: and there is no greater Agument of an imprudent Man, than to gratifie himſelf for the preſent in the doing of a thing, which will turn to his greater prejudice after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; eſpecially if the future Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience be great and intolerable, as it is in the Caſe we are ſpeaking of. For eternal Happineſs or Miſery depends upon the Actions of this preſent Life, and according as we behave our ſelves in this World, it will go well or ill with us for ever; ſo that this is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of vaſt importance, and deſerves our moſt ſerious thoughts; and in matters of mighty conſequence, a wiſe Man will take all things into Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and look before him as far as he can. And indeed this is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why things of great moment are ſaid to be things of Conſequence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe great things depend and are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow upon them: and then
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:43767:218"/>
ſurely that is the greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon which not only the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of this preſent Life, but our Happineſs to all eternity does depend; and if the good and bad Actions of this Life be of that conſequence to us, it is fit every Man ſhould conſider what he does, and whither the Courſe of Life he is engaged or about to engage in, will lead him at laſt. For this is true wiſdom, to look to the end of things, and to think ſeriouſly before hand, what is likely to be the event of ſuch an Action, of ſuch a Courſe of Life: if we ſerve God faithfully and do his Will, what will be the conſequence of that to us in this World, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and on the other hand, if we live wickedly, and allow our ſelves in any unlawful and vicious Practice, what will be the end of that Courſe.</p>
            <p>And to any Man that conſults the Law of his own Nature, or the will of God revealed in Scripture, nothing can be plainer than what will be the end of theſe ſeveral ways. God hath plainly told us, and our own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences will tell us the ſame, that <hi>If we do well, we ſhall be accepted</hi> of God, and rewarded by him: but if we do ill,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:43767:218"/>
               <hi>the end of theſe things is Death</hi>; that <hi>indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh will be upon every ſoul of Man that doth evil; but honour and glory and peace to every Man that doth good, in the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that God hath given us a plain proſpect of the different Iſſues of a virtuous and a wicked Life, and there wants nothing but Conſideration to make us to attend to theſe things, and to lay them ſeriouſly to heart. For while men are inconſiderate, they go on ſtupidly in an evil way, and are not ſenſible of the danger of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Courſe, becauſe they do not attend to the conſequence of it: but when their Eyes are once opened by Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, they cannot but be ſadly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the miſchief they are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelves upon. If men would take but a ſerious and impartial view of their Lives and Actions, if they would conſider the tendency of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Courſe, and whither it will bring them at laſt; if the vicious and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Man would but look about him, and conſider how many have been ruined in that very way that he is in,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:43767:219"/>
how many lie <hi>ſlain and wounded in it</hi>; that <hi>it is the way to Hell, and leads down to the Chambers of Death</hi>; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thought of this could not but check him in his Courſe, and make him reſolve upon a better Life. If men were wiſe, they would conſider the conſequence of their Actions, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Conſideration would reſolve upon that which they are convinc'd is beſt. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thing I propounded, which was, that Conſideration of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of our Actions, is an excellent means to prevent the miſchiefs, which otherwiſe we ſhould run into. And this is neceſſarily implyed in the wiſh here in the Text, that if we would but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things, they might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. For how can any Man, who hath any love or regard for himſelf, any tenderneſs for his own Intereſt and Happineſs, ſee Hell and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before him, which, if he hold on in his evil Courſe, will certainly ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him up, and yet venture to go on in his Sins? Can any Man that plainly beholds Miſery haſtning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him <hi>like an armed Man,</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction coming upon him as a whirl-wind,</hi>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:43767:219"/>
think himſelf unconcerned to prevent it and flie from it? The moſt dull and ſtupid Creatures will ſtart back upon the ſight of preſent danger. <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſs, when ſhe ſaw the Angel of the Lord ſtanding in the way, with his Sword drawn ready to ſmite her, ſtarts aſide, and could not be urged on. Now God hath given us, not only Senſe to apprehend a preſent evil, but Reaſon and Conſideration to look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and to diſcover dangers at a diſtance, to apprehend them as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and with as clear a Conviction of the reality of them, as if they threatned us the next moment: and will any conſiderate Man, who hath calculated the dangerous events of Sin, and the dreadful effects of God's wrath upon ſinners, go on to <hi>provoke the Lord to jealouſie, as if he were ſtronger than he?</hi> It is not to be imagined, but that if men would ſeriouſly conſider what Sin is, and what ſhall be the ſad Portion of ſinners hereafter, they would reſolve upon a better Courſe. Would any Man live in the Luſts of the fleſh and of intemperance, or out of Covetouſneſs defraud or oppreſs his Neighbour, did he ſeriouſly conſider,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:43767:220"/>
that <hi>God is the avenger of ſuch</hi>; and that <hi>becauſe of theſe things the wrath of God comes upon the Children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould have great hopes of mens Repentance and Reformation, if they could but once be brought to Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: for in moſt men it is not ſo much a poſitive disbelief of the Truth, as inadvertency and want of Conſideration, that makes them to go on ſo ſecurely in a ſinful Courſe. Would but men conſider what Sin is, and what will be the fearful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it, probably in this World, but moſt certainly in the other, they could not chuſe but flie from it as the greateſt evil in the World.</p>
            <p>And to ſhew what Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence Conſideration will probably have to bring men to Repentance, and a change of their Lives, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have ſome where met with a very remarkable ſtory, of one that had a Son that took bad Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and would not be reclaimed by all the good Counſel his Father could give him; at laſt coming to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who lay upon his Death-Bed, to beg his Bleſſing, his Father inſtead
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:43767:220"/>
of upbraiding him with his bad Life and undutiful Carriage toward him, ſpake kindly to him, and told him he had but one thing to deſire of him, That every day he would retire and ſpend one quarter of an hour alone by himſelf; which he promiſed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faithfully to do, and made it good: after a while it grew tedious to him, to ſpend even ſo little time in ſuch bad and uneaſie Company, and he began to bethink himſelf, for what Reaſon his Father ſhould ſo earneſtly deſire of him to do ſo odd a thing for his ſake, and his mind preſently ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him, that it was to enforce him to Conſideration; wiſely judging that if by any means he could but bring him to that, he would ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Life and become a new Man. And the thing had its deſired effect; for after a very little Conſideration, he took up a firm Reſolution to change the Courſe of his Life, and was true to it all his days. I cannot anſwer for the truth of the Story, but for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of it I will; namely, that Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is one of the beſt and moſt likely means in the World, to bring a bad Man to a better Mind. I now come to the</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="434" facs="tcp:43767:221"/>IV. And laſt particular, namely, that the want of this Conſideration is one of the greateſt Cauſes of mens Ruin. And this likewiſe is implyed in the Text; and the Reaſon why God does ſo vehemently deſire that men would be wiſe and conſider, is becauſe ſo many are ruin'd and undone for want of it. This is the deſperate folly of Mankind, that they ſeldom think ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of the Conſequence of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and leaſt of all of ſuch as are of greateſt Concernment to them, and have the chief influence upon their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Condition. They do not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Miſchief and Inconvenience a wicked Life may plunge them into in this World, what Trouble and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance it may give them when they come to die, what Horror and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it may fill them withal when they are leaving this World, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing into Eternity, and what intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miſery and Torment it may bring upon them to all Eternity. Did men ponder and lay to heart Death and Judgment, Heaven and Hell, and would they but let their thoughts dwell upon theſe things, it is not credible that the generality of men could lead ſuch

profane and impious, ſuch lewd and diſſolute, ſuch ſecure and careleſs Lives as they do.</p>
            <p>Would but a Man frequently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Mind with ſuch thoughts as theſe; I muſt ſhortly die and leave this World, and then all the Pleaſures and Enjoyments of it will be to me as if they had never been, only that the remembrance of them, and the ill uſe I have made of them, will be very bitter and grievous to me; after all Death will tranſmit me out of this World, into a quite different State and Scene of things, into the preſence of that great and terrible, that inflexible and impartial Judge, who will <hi>render to every Man according to his works,</hi> and then all the evils which I have done in this Life, will riſe up in Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and fill me with everlaſting Confuſion, in that great aſſembly of Men and Angels, will baniſh me from the preſence of God, and all the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which flows from it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a dreadful ſentence of unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miſery and Torment to be paſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, which I can never get reverſt, nor yet ever be able to ſtand under the weight of it: if men would but enter
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:43767:222"/>
into the ſerious Conſideration of theſe things, and purſue theſe thoughts to ſome Iſſue and Concluſion, they would take up other Reſolutions; and I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, that the want of this hath ruin'd more than even infidelity it ſelf. And this I take to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that queſtion in the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Have all the workers of iniquity no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi> that is, <hi>no Conſideration</hi>; inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that if they had, they would do better.</p>
            <p>All that now remains, is to perſwade men to apply their hearts to this piece of wiſdom, to look before them, and to think ſeriouſly of the Conſequence of their Actions, what will be the final Iſſue of that Courſe of Life they are engaged in; and if they continue in it, what will become of them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, what will become of them for ever.</p>
            <p>And here I might apply this Text, as God here does to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to the publick Condition of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is not ſo very unlike to that of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi>: for God ſeems to have choſen this Nation for his more peculiar People, and hath exerciſed a very particular Providence
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:43767:222"/>
towards us, in conducting us through that Wilderneſs of Confuſion, in which we have been wandring for the ſpace of above forty years, and when things were come to the laſt extremity, and we ſeemed to ſtand upon the very brink of Ruin, <hi>Then</hi> (as it is ſaid of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ver. 36. of this Chapter) <hi>God repented himſelf for his ſervants, when he ſaw that their Power was gone,</hi> that is, that they were utterly unable to help themſelves, and to work their own deliverance. And it may be ſaid of us, as <hi>Moſes</hi> does of that People, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.29. <hi>Happy art thou,</hi> O Iſrael, <hi>O people ſaved by the Lord, the ſhield of thy help, and who is the Sword of thy excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency!</hi> Never did any Nation ſtruggle with, and get through ſo many and ſo great difficulties, as we have ſeveral times done.</p>
            <p>And I fear we have behaved our ſelves toward God, not much better than the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, but like <hi>Jeſurun,</hi> after many deliverances and great mercies, <hi>have waxed fat and kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have forſaken the God that made us, and little eſteemed the Rock of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by which we have <hi>provoked the Lord to jealouſie,</hi> and have as it were
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:43767:223"/>
forc'd him to multiply his Judgments, and to ſpend his arrows upon us, and <hi>to hide his face from us, to ſee what our end will be</hi>; ſo that we have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear, that God would have brought utter Ruin and Deſtruction upon us, and <hi>ſcatter'd us into corners,</hi> and <hi>made the remembrance of us to have ceaſed from among men, had he not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wrath of the enemy, and leſt the adverſaries ſhould have behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtrangely, and leſt they ſhould ſay Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this</hi>; that is, leſt they ſhould aſcribe this juſt vengeance of God upon a ſinful and unthankful Nation, to the goodneſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own Cauſe, and to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and aſſiſtance of the Idols and falſe Gods whom they worſhip'd, to the Patronage and Aid of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and the Saints, to whom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Will and Command of the true God, they had offer'd up ſo many Prayers and Vows, and paid the greateſt part of their Religious worſhip: but <hi>the Lord hath ſhewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf greater than all Gods, and in the things wherein they dealt proudly, that he is above them: for our Rock is not as their
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:43767:223"/>
Rock, even our enemies themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we have been too like the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in other reſpects alſo, ſo ſickle and inconſtant, that after great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances we are apt preſently to murmur and be diſcontented, to grow ſick of our own Happineſs, and <hi>to turn back in our hearts into</hi> Egypt; ſo that God may complain of us, as he does of his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that nothing that he could do, would bring them to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and make them better, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his mercies nor his Judgments. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Hear, O Heavens! and give ear, O Earth! For the Lord hath ſpoken; I have nouriſhed and brought up Children, but they have rebelled againſt me. The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Aſs his Maſters Crib: but</hi> Iſrael <hi>doth not know, my People doth not conſider.</hi> And ſo likewiſe he complains, that his Judgments had no effect upon them, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſmitten any more? Ye will revolt more and more.</hi> Well therefore may it be ſaid of us, as it was of them in the Verſe before the Text, <hi>They are a Nation void of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, neither is there any underſtanding in them.</hi> And the wiſh that follows in
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:43767:224"/>
the Text, is as ſeaſonable for us as it was for them, <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they uaderſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by parity of Reaſon, this may likewiſe be applyed to particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and to perſwade every one of us to a ſerious Conſideration, of the final Iſſue and Conſequence of our Actions. I will only offer theſe <hi>two</hi> Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That Conſideration is the proper Act of reaſonable Creatures, and that whereby we ſhew our ſelves men. So the Prophet intimates, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.8. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, and ſhew your ſelves men; bring it again to mind, O ye tranſgreſſors!</hi> that is, conſider it well, think of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, ye that run on ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly in a ſinful Courſe, what the end and iſſue of theſe things will be. If ye do not do this, you do not <hi>ſhew your ſelves men,</hi> you do not act like reaſonable Creatures, to whom it is peculiar to propoſe to themſelves ſome end and deſign of their Actions; but rather like <hi>Brute Creatures, which have no underſtanding,</hi> and act only by a natural inſtinct, without any Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the end of their Actions, or of the means conducing to it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="441" facs="tcp:43767:224"/>II. Whether we conſider it or not, our latter end will come; and all thoſe diſmal Conſequences of a ſinful Courſe, which God hath ſo plainly threatned, and our own Conſciences do ſo much dread, will certainly overtake us at laſt; and we cannot, by not thinking of theſe things, ever prevent or avoid them. Death will come, and after that the Judgment, and an irreverſible Doom will paſs upon us, according to all the evil that we have done, and all the good that we have neglected to do in this Life, under the heavy weight and preſſure whereof we muſt lie groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bewailing our ſelves to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Ages.</p>
            <p>God now exerciſeth his Mercy and Patience and Long-ſuffering toward us, in expectation of our amendment; he reprieves us on purpoſe that we may repent, and in hopes that we will at laſt conſider and grow wiſer; for <hi>he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance</hi>: but if we will trifle away this day of God's Grace and Patience, if we will not conſider and bethink our ſelves, there is another day that will certainly come, <hi>That great and terrible Day of
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:43767:225"/>
the Lord, in which the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall melt with fervent heat, the Earth alſo and the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seeing then all theſe things ſhall be,</hi> let us conſider ſeriouſly <hi>what manner of Perſons we ought to be in all holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Godlineſs, waiting for and haſtning unto the coming of the Day of God. To whom be glory now and for ever.</hi>

                  <p>Woe unto thee Chorazin, woe unto thee Bethſaida: for if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes.

            <p>AFter our Bleſſed Saviour had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and ſent forth his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he himſelf went abroad to preach unto the Cities of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly he ſpent much time in the
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:43767:226"/>
Cities of <hi>Galilee, Chorazin,</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vol. 8.</note> and <hi>Capernaum,</hi> Preaching the Goſpel to them, and working many and great Miracles among them; but with little or no ſucceſs, which was the cauſe of his denouncing this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble woe againſt them, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Then began he to upbraid the Cities, wherein moſt of his mighty works were done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they repented not. Woe unto thee Chorazin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In which words our Saviour declares the ſad and miſerable Condition of thoſe two Cities, <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> which had neglected ſuch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and reſiſted and withſtood ſuch means of Repentance, as would have effectually reclaimed the moſt wicked Cities and People that can be inſtanced in in any Age, <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> and <hi>Sodom</hi>; and therefore he tells them, that their Condition was much worſe, and that they ſhould fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a heavier Sentence at the day of Judgment, than the People of thoſe Cities, whom they had always lookt upon as the greateſt ſinners that ever were in the World. This is the plain meaning of the words in general; but yet there are ſome difficulties in them,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:43767:226"/>
which I ſhall endeavour to clear, and then proceed to raiſe ſuch Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from them, as may be inſtructive and uſeful to us.</p>
            <p>The Difficulties are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What Repentance is here ſpoken of; whether an external Repentance in ſhew and appearance only, or an inward and real and ſincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In what Senſe it is ſaid, that <hi>Tyre and Sidon would have repented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. What is meant by their <hi>would have repented long ago.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. How this aſſertion of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's, that Miracles would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> is reconcileable with that other ſaying of his, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.31. in the Parable of the rich Man and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that <hi>thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they be perſuaded, tho' one roſe from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. What Repentance is here ſpoken of; whether a meer external and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Repentance in ſhew and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance only, or an inward and real and ſincere Repentance.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of this doubt depends upon the different Theories of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:43767:227"/>
about the ſufficiency of Grace accompanying the outward Means of Repentance, and whether an irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of God's Grace be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Repentance: for they who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſufficient Grace to accompany the outward Means of Repentance, and aſſert an irreſiſtible degree of God's Grace neceſſary to Repentance, are forced to ſay, that our Saviour here ſpeaks of a meer External Repentance: becauſe if he ſpake of an inward and ſincere Repentance, then it muſt be granted, that ſufficient inward grace did accompany the Miracles that were wrought in <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> to bring men to Repentance; becauſe what was afforded to them, would have brought <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And that which would have effected a thing, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to be ſufficient; ſo that unleſs our Saviour here ſpeaks of a meer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Repentance, either the outward Means of Repentance, as Preaching and Miracles, muſt be granted to be ſufficient to bring men to Repentance, without the inward Operation of God's Grace upon the Minds of Men; or elſe a ſufficient degree of God's
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:43767:227"/>
Grace muſt be acknowledged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the outward Means of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Again, if an irreſiſtible degree of Grace be neceſſary to true Repentance, it is plain, <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> had it not, becauſe they did not repent; and yet without this <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> could not have ſincerely repented; therefore our Saviour here muſt ſpeak of a meer External Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Thus ſome argue, as they do likewiſe concerning the Repentance of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> making that alſo to be meerly External, becauſe they are loath to allow true Repentance to Heathens.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems very plain, that our Saviour does ſpeak of an inward and true and ſincere Repentance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Doctrines that will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this, are not true. For our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeaks of the ſame kind of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that he upbraided them with the want of in the verſe before the Text. <hi>Then began he to upbraid the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherein moſt of his mighty works were done, becauſe they repented not,</hi> that is becauſe they were not brought to a ſincere Repentance by his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was confirmed by ſuch
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:43767:228"/>
great Miracles. 'Tis true indeed, he mentions the outward ſigns and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Repentance, when he ſays <hi>They would have repented in ſackcloth and aſhes</hi>; but not as excluding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and real Repentance, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it, as is evident from what is ſaid in the next Verſe, <hi>It ſhall be more tolerable for</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon <hi>at the day of Judgment, than for you:</hi> for tho' an external and hypocritical Repentance, may prevail with God to put off temporal Judgments, yet ſurely it will be but a very ſmall, if any mitigation of our Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the day of Judgment: ſo that the Repentance here ſpoken of cannot, without great violence to the ſcope and deſign of our Saviour's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, be underſtood only of an external ſhew and appearance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The next difficulty to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is, in what Senſe it is here ſaid, that <hi>if the mighty works which were done</hi> by our Saviour among the <hi>Jews, had been done in</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>they would have repented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some to avoid the inconvenience which they apprehend to be in the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:43767:228"/>
more ſtrict and literal Senſe of the words, look upon them as Hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as we ſay <hi>Such a thing would move a Stone,</hi> or the like, when we would expreſs ſomething to be very ſad and grievous; ſo here to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Impenitence of the <hi>Jews,</hi> our Saviour ſays, that they reſiſted thoſe Means of Repentance, which one would think ſhould almoſt have prevailed upon the greateſt and moſt obdurate Sinners that ever were; but not intending to affirm any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>But there is no colour for this, if we conſider that our Saviour Reaſons from the Suppoſition of ſuch a thing, that therefore the Caſe of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> would really be <hi>more tolerable at the day of Judgment than theirs</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they would have repented,</hi> but the <hi>Jews</hi> did not.</p>
            <p>Others perhaps underſtand the words too ſtrictly, as if our Saviour had ſpoken according to what he certainly foreknew would have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the People of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> if ſuch Miracles had been wrought among them. And no doubt but in that Caſe God did certainly
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:43767:229"/>
know what they would have done: but yet I ſhould rather chuſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtand the words as ſpoken popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, according to what in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane appearance and probability would have hapned, if ſuch Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Means of Repentance, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an ordinary Grace of God, had been afforded to them of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon.</hi> And thus the old <hi>Latine</hi> Interpreter ſeems to have underſtood the next words, <hi>If the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been done in</hi> Sodom, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>forte man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſent, it would perhaps have remained to this day, in all likelyhood it had continued till now.</hi> Much the ſame with that paſſage of the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Thou art not ſent to a People of a ſtrange Speech, and of a hard Language, but to the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>Surely had I ſent thee to them, they would have hearkned unto thee,</hi> that is, in all probability they would, there is little doubt to be made of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And this is ſufficient Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our Saviour's reaſoning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that <hi>it ſhall be more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon <hi>in the day of Judgment than for them.</hi> And if we
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:43767:229"/>
may judge what they would have done before, by what they did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, there is more than probability for it: for we read in the 21<hi>ſt</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> ver. 3. and ver. 27. that the Inhabitants of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Goſpel, and kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when the <hi>Jews</hi> rejected them both. The</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thing to be cleared, is, What is meant by <hi>long ago; They would have repented long ago.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some underſtand this, as if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had ſaid, they would not have ſtood out ſo long againſt ſo much Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſo many Miracles; but would at firſt have repented, long before our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gave over <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> for obſtinate and incorrigible Sinners; they would not only have repented at laſt, but much ſooner and without ſo much ado.</p>
            <p>But this does not ſeem to be the meaning of the words; but our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſeems to refer to thoſe ancient Times <hi>long ago,</hi> when the Prophets denounced Judgments againſt <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> particularly the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and to ſay, that if in thoſe days the Preaching of that Prophet had been accompanied with ſuch Miracles as
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:43767:230"/>
our Saviour wrought in the Cities of <hi>Galilee, Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> would in thoſe days have repented.</p>
            <p>The <hi>laſt</hi> and greateſt difficulty of all is, How this aſſertion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that Miracles would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> is reconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with that Diſcourſe of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. in the Parable of the rich Man and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that <hi>Thoſe who would not believe</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, would not have been perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, tho' one</hi> had <hi>roſe from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The true anſwer to which difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſhort is this; That when our Saviour ſays, <hi>If they believe not</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded, tho' one roſe from the dead,</hi> he does not hereby weaken the force of Miracles, or their apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to convince men and bring them to Repentance, but rather confirm it; becauſe <hi>Moſes and the Prophets</hi> had the atteſtation of many and great Miracles, and therefore there was no Reaſon to think, that they who would not believe the Writings and Doctrine of <hi>Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> which had the Confirmation of ſo many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and was owned by themſelves
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:43767:230"/>
to have ſo, ſhould be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by one particular Miracle, <hi>The coming of one from the dead, and ſpeaking unto them</hi>: or however this might move and aſtoniſh them for the preſent, yet it was not likely that the Grace of God ſhould concur with ſuch an extraordinary Means, to render it effectual to their Converſion and Repentance, who had wilfully deſpiſed and obſtinately rejected that which had a much greater Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the Diſcourſe of a Man riſen from the dead, and was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God for the ordinary and ſtanding Means of bringing men to Repentance. So that our Saviour might with Reaſon enough pronounce that <hi>Tyre and Sidon,</hi> who never had a ſtanding Revelation of God to bring them to Repentance, nor had reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, would upon Miracles extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily wrought among them have Repented; and yet deny it elſewhere to be likely, that they who rejected a ſtanding Revelation of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Miracles, which call'd them to Repentance, would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be brought to Repentance by a particular Miracle; or that God ſhould
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:43767:231"/>
afford his Grace to make it effectual for their Repentance and Salvation.</p>
            <p>The words being thus cleared, I come now to raiſe ſuch Obſervations from them, as may be inſtructive and uſeful to us.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I obſerve from this Diſcourſe of our Saviour, that Miracles are of great force and efficacy to bring men to Repentance.</p>
            <p>This our Saviour's Diſcourſe here ſuppoſeth; otherwiſe their Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence had not been ſo Criminal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable upon that account, <hi>That ſuch mighty works had been done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them,</hi> as would probably have prevailed upon ſome of the worſt People that had been in the World; for ſuch were the Inhabitants of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> guilty of great Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Fraud, Pride and Luxury, the uſual Sins of Places of great Traffick and Commerce; and ſuch to be ſure was <hi>Sodom</hi>; and yet our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tells us, that the Miracles which he had wrought in the Cities of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> would in all probability have brought thoſe great Sinners to Repentance; namely, by bringing them to Faith, and convincing them
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:43767:231"/>
of the Truth and Divinity of that Doctrine, which he preached unto them, and which contains ſuch power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Arguments to Repentance and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of Life.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I obſerve likewiſe from our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Diſcourſe, that God is not always obliged to work Miracles for the Converſion of Sinners. It is great goodneſs in him to afford ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Means of Repentance to men, as he did to <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to Repentance by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; tho' ſuch Miracles were not wrought among them, as God thought fit to accompany our Saviour's Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withal.</p>
            <p>This I obſerve, to prevent a kind of bold and ſaucy Objection, which ſome would perhaps be apt to make; If <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> would have Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, had ſuch Miracles been wrought among them, as our Saviour wrought in <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> why were they not wrought, that they might have Repented? To which it is ſufficient Anſwer to ſay, That God is not obliged to do all that is poſſible to be done, to reclaim men from their Sins; he is not obliged to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:43767:232"/>
their Wills, and to work irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibly upon their Minds, which he can eaſily do; he is not obliged to work Miracles for every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Man's Conviction; nor where he vouchſafeth to do this, is he obliged always to work the greateſt and moſt convincing Miracles; his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will not ſuffer him to omit what is neceſſary and ſufficient to bring men to Repentance and Happineſs, nay beyond this he many times does more; but it is ſufficient to vindicate the Juſtice and Goodneſs of God, that he is not wanting to us, in afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Means neceſſary to reclaim us from our Sins, and to bring us to goodneſs. That which is properly our part, is to make uſe of thoſe Means which God affords us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come better, and not to preſcribe to him how much he ſhould do for us; to be thankful that he hath done ſo much, and not to find fault with him for having done no more.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I obſerve farther from our Saviour's Diſcourſe, That the External Means of Repentance which God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords to men, do ſuppoſe an Inward Grace of God accompanying them,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:43767:232"/>
ſufficiently enabling men to repent, if it be not their own fault; I ſay a ſufficient Grace of God accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the outward Means of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, till by our wilful and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate neglect and reſiſtance and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this Grace, we provoke God to withdraw it from the Means, or elſe to withdraw both the Grace and the Means from us: otherwiſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence after ſuch external Means afforded, would be no new and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial fault. For if the concurrence of God's Grace with the outward Means be neceſſary to work Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then the Impenitence of thoſe to whom this Grace is not afforded, which yet is neceſſary to Repentance, is neither any new Sin, nor any new Aggravation of their former Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. For no Man can imagine that the juſt God will charge men with new guilt, and increaſe their Condemnation, for remaining impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in ſuch Circumſtances, in which it is impoſſible for them to repent.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I obſerve from this Diſcourſe of our Saviour's, That an Irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of Grace is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Repentance, nor commonly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:43767:233"/>
to thoſe who do repent. God may where he pleaſeth, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to any Man, over-power his Will, and ſtop him in his Courſe, and hinder him from making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf miſerable, and by an Irreſiſtible Light convince him of his Error and the Evil of his ways, and bring him to a better Mind: but this God ſeldom does; and when he does it, it is very probable it is not ſo much for their own ſakes, as to make them Inſtruments of good to others. Thus by a ſecret but over-powering influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he over-ruled the Diſciples to follow our Saviour, and to leave their Callings and Relations, and all their temporal Concernments to do it. But one of the moſt remarkable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this extraordinary Grace of God, is St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtopt in his Courſe of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Chriſtians, and convinc'd of his Sin, and brought over to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, in a very extraordinary and forcible manner. And of this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and extraordinary Converſion, God himſelf gives this account, <hi>That he was a choſen Veſſel unto him, to bear his name before the Gentiles, and Kings,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:43767:233"/>
and the Children of Iſrael,</hi> Acts 9.15. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>That for this end God had ſeparated him from his Mother's womb, and call'd him by his Grace, and revealed his Son to him</hi> in that extraordinary manner, <hi>that he might preach him among the Heathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But generally God does not bring men thus to Repentance; nor is it neceſſary he ſhould. For if an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible degree of Grace were always neceſſary to bring men to Repentance, there could be no difference between the Impenitence of <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida,</hi> and of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon.</hi> For according to this Doctrine of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Irreſiſtible Grace to the Converſion of every Man, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> neither could, nor would have repented, without an irreſiſtible degree of God's Grace accompanying the outward Means of Repentance which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to them; becauſe ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Grace is neceſſary to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and without it, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any Man to repent. But then it is as plain on the contrary, that if <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> had
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:43767:234"/>
had the ſame irreſiſtible degree of God's Grace, together with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means of Repentance afforded to them, that they would have repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as certainly as <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon.</hi> Where then is the Reaſon of upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Impenitence of the one, more than of the other? Where the Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the one's Guilt above the other? Where the Juſtice of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Impenitence of <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> more than theirs of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi>? For upon this ſuppoſition, they muſt either have repented both alike, or have been both equally Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent. The ſum of what I have ſaid is this, That if no Man does, nor can repent, without ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of God's Grace as cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, no Man's Repentance is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, nor is one Man's Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence more blameable than anothers; <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> can be in no more fault for continuing Impenitent, than <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> were. For either this irreſiſtible Grace is afforded to men or not: if it be, their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is neceſſary, and they cannot help it; if it be not, their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is impoſſible, and conſequently
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:43767:234"/>
their Impenitence is neceſſary, and they cannot help it neither.</p>
            <p n="5">V. I obſerve from the main ſcope of our Saviour's Diſcourſe, That the Sins and Impenitence of men receive their Aggravation, and conſequently ſhall have their Puniſhment, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the Opportunities and Means of Repentance, which thoſe Perſons have enjoyed and negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
            <p>For what is here ſaid of Miracles, is by equality of Reaſon likewiſe true of all other Advantages and Means of Repentance and Salvation. The Reaſon why Miracles will be ſuch an Aggravation of the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of men is, becauſe they are ſo proper and powerful a Means to convince men of the Truth and Divinity of that Doctrine which calls them to Repentance. So that all thoſe Means which God affords to us, of the Knowledge of our Duty, of Conviction of the Evil and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a ſinful Courſe, are ſo many helps and Motives to Repentance, and conſequently will prove ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Aggravations of our Sin and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:43767:235"/>
if we continue impenitent. The</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And <hi>laſt</hi> Obſervation, and which naturally follows from the former, is this, That the Caſe of thoſe who are impenitent under the Goſpel, is of all others the moſt dangerous, and their Damnation ſhall be heavieſt and moſt ſevere.</p>
            <p>And this brings the Caſe of theſe Cities here in the Text home to our ſelves. For in truth there is no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial difference between the Caſe of <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> and <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and of our ſelves in this City and Nation, who enjoy the clear Light of the Goſpel, with all the freedom, and all the Advantages that any People ever did. The Mercies of God to this Nation have been very great, eſpecially in bringing us out of that darkneſs and ſuperſtition, which covered this Weſtern part of the World; in reſcuing us from that great Corruption and Degeneracy of the Chriſtian Religion which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed among us, by ſo early and ſo regular a Reformation; and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſo long this great Bleſſing to
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:43767:235"/>
us. The Judgments of God have been likewiſe very great upon us for our Sins; <hi>God hath manifeſted himſelf by terrible things in righteouſneſs</hi>; our Eyes have ſeen many and diſmal Calamities in the ſpace of a few years, which call lowdly upon us to repent and turn to God. God hath afforded us the moſt effectual Means of Repentance, and hath taken the moſt effectual Courſe of bringing us to it. And tho' our Bleſſed Saviour do not ſpeak to us in Perſon, nor do we at this day ſee Miracles wrought among us, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did; yet we have the Doctrine which our Bleſſed Saviour preach'd, faithfully tranſmitted to us, and a credible Relation of the Miracles wrought for the Confirmation of that Doctrine, and many other Arguments to perſwade us of the Truth of it, which thoſe to whom our Saviour ſpake had not, nor could not then have, taken from the accompliſhing of our Saviour's Predictions, after his Death; the ſpeedy Propagation and wonderful ſucceſs of this Doctrine in the World, by weak and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Means, againſt all the Power and Oppoſition of the World; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:43767:236"/>
of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, according to our Saviour's Propheſie; beſides many more that might be mentioned. And which is a mighty Advantage to us, we are free from thoſe Prejudices againſt the Perſon of our Saviour and his Doctrine, which the <hi>Jews,</hi> by the reverence which they bore to their Rulers and Teachers, were generally poſſeſt withal; we are brought up in the belief of it, and have drunk it in by Education; and if we believe it, as we all profeſs to do, we have all the Obligation and all the Arguments to Repentance, which the <hi>Jews</hi> could poſſibly have from the Miracles which they ſaw; for they were Means of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to them, no otherwiſe than as they brought them to the belief of our Saviour's Doctrine, which call'd them to Repentance.</p>
            <p>So that if we continue impenitent, the ſame woe is denounced againſt us, that is againſt <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi>; and we may be ſaid with <hi>Capernaum, to be lifted up to Heaven,</hi> by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the moſt excellent Means and Advantages of Salvation, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People ever did, which if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:43767:236"/>
and ſtill continue wicked and impenitent under them, we may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear, that with them <hi>we ſhall be thrown down to Hell,</hi> and have our place in the loweſt part of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Dungeon, and in the very Centre of that fiery Furnace.</p>
            <p>Never was there greater cauſe to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid the impenitence of any People, than of us, conſidering the Means and Opportunities which we enjoy; and never had any greater reaſon to fear a ſeverer Doom, than we have. Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence in a Heathen is a great Sin; elſe how ſhould God judge the World? But God takes no notice of that, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Impenitence of Chriſtians, who enjoy the Goſpel, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Truth, and upon the greateſt reaſon in the World profeſs to believe it. We Chriſtians have all the Obligations to Repentance, that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Revelation, Nature and Grace can lay upon us. Art thou convinced that thou haſt ſinned, and done that which is contrary to thy Duty, and thereby provoked the Wrath of God, and incenſed his Juſtice againſt thee? As thou art a Man, and upon the ſtock of Natural Principles, thou
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:43767:237"/>
art obliged to Repentance. The ſame Light of Reaſon which diſcovers to thee the Errors of thy Life, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth thee for thy Impiety and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, for thy Injuſtice and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, for thy Pride and Paſſion; the ſame Natural Conſcience, which accuſeth thee of any Miſcarriages, does oblige thee to be ſorry for it, <hi>to turn from thy evil ways,</hi> and <hi>to break off thy Sins by Repentance.</hi>For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more unreaſonable, than for a Man to know a fault, and yet not think himſelf bound to be ſorry for it; to be convinced of the evil of his ways, and not to think himſelf obliged by that very Conviction, to turn from it and forſake it. If there be any ſuch thing as a natural <hi>Law written in Mens Hearts,</hi> which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us the Heathens had, it is impoſſible to imagine, but that the Law which obligeth Men not to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, ſhould oblige them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in caſe of Tranſgreſſion. And this every Man in the World is bound to, tho' he had never ſeen the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor heard of the name of Chriſt. And the Revelation of the Goſpel doth not ſuperſede this Obligation,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:43767:237"/>
but adds new Strength and Force to it; and by how much this Duty of Repentance is more clearly revealed by our Bleſſed Saviour in the Goſpel, by how much the Arguments which the Goſpel uſeth to perſuade Men, and encourage them to Repentance, are greater and more powerful; by ſo much is the Impenitence of thoſe who live under the Goſpel the more inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>Had we only ſome faint hopes of God's Mercy, a doubtful Opinion and weak Perſuaſion of the Rewards and Puniſhments of another World; yet we have a Law within us, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the probability of theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations would oblige us to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Indeed if Men were aſſur'd upon good grounds, that there would be no future Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; then the ſanction of the Law were gone, and it would loſe its force and Obligation: or if we did deſpair of the Mercy of God, and had good Reaſon to think Repentance impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or that it would do us no good; in that caſe there would be no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Motive and Argument to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: for no Man can return to his
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:43767:238"/>
Duty, without returning to the love of God and Goodneſs; and no man can return to the love of God, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that he bears an implacable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt him, and is reſolved to make him miſerable for ever. During this Perſuaſion no Man can repent. And this ſeems to be the reaſon, why the Devils continue impenitent.</p>
            <p>But the Heathens were not without hopes of God's Mercy, and upon thoſe ſmall hopes which they had they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged themſelves into Repentance; as you may ſee in the inſtance of the <hi>Ninevites, Let them turn every one from his evil ways, and from the violence that is in his hands. Who can tell, if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we periſh not?</hi> Jonah 3.8, 9. But if we, who have the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Diſcoveries, and the higheſt Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this, who profeſs to believe that God hath declared himſelf placa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all Mankind, that <hi>he is in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf,</hi> and that upon our Repentance <hi>he will not impute our Sins to us</hi>; if we, to whom <hi>the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men,</hi> and to whom <hi>Life and
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:43767:238"/>
Immortality are brought to Light by the Goſpel,</hi> if after all this, we ſtill go on in any impenitent Courſe, what ſhall we be able to plead in excuſe of our ſelves at that great day? <hi>The men of</hi> Nineveh <hi>ſhall riſe up in Judgment</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch an impenitent Generation, <hi>and Condemn it; becauſe they repented</hi> upon the Terror of lighter threatnings, and upon the Encouragement of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hops.</p>
            <p>And therefore it concerns us, who call our ſelves Chriſtians, and enjoy the clear Revelation of the Goſpel, to look about us, and take heed how we continue in an Evil Courſe. For if we remain impenitent, after all the Arguments which the Goſpel, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the Light of Nature, affords to us to bring us to Repentance, it ſhall not only <hi>be more tolerable for the men of</hi> Nineveh, but <hi>for</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, the moſt wicked and impenitent Heathens, <hi>at the day of Judgment, than for us.</hi> For becauſe we have ſtronger Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and more powerful Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Repentance, than they had, if we do not repent, we ſhall meet with a heavier Doom, and a fiercer
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:43767:239"/>
Damnation. The Heathen World had many excuſes to plead for themſelves, which we have not. <hi>The times of that ignorance God winked at: but now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all men every where to repent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the World in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, by that Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi>
