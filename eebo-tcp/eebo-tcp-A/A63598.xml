            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THe moſt remarkable Tryal that hapned the firſt Morning, was of two perſons of a different Sex, who were Indicted for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering a young Man in the <hi>Pall-mell</hi> about <hi>Whitſuntide</hi> laſt: The Tryal was very tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous there being much Evidence produced on both ſides; but it being made appear there was no premeditated Malice on the Priſoners ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo that the Deceaſed, did (being in Drink) firſt aſſault the Man-Priſoner, who forwarn'd him from doing ſo; Likewiſe that the Woman did, (beſides one little blow ſhe hit him on the Calf of the Leg,) all poſſibly ſhe could to part them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Deceaſed diſowning after he had taken the Sacrament in order to his Diſſolution, that he had received any Hurt by them: They were both acquitted.</p>
            <p>The next were two young Foot-Pads, Indicted for Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Lace-man</hi> of 113. Yards of Bone-Lace; the manner thus. The Lace-Man in his way from <hi>Wickham</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> was ſet upon by the Priſoners at the Bar, one laying hold of one of his Legs, and the other of his Horſes Bridle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when they had unhorſt him, and pluck'd off the Bridle and Saddle for fear of Purſuit, they forc'd from him the ſaid Lace, and ſo departed; they on their way, and he for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> where he had not been long, but a Woman out of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106975:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Pater-noſter-Row,</hi> comes to his Lodging or Ware-houſe, pretending to buy ſome of the ſame ſort, (but intending ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſell that ſhe had,) ſhe demanded the Price of it, which being reſolved her; ſhe anſwered him, ſhe could Sell himſelf as good, at a much lower Rate; he replyed then, he was ſure ſhe muſt Steal it, which ſhe denyed with an Oath: But in ſhort, when ſhe had ſhown him her good Penniworth, he knew the Lace to be his own; and ſo ſending for a Conſtable to Seize her, ſhe promiſed ſhe would bring him to the Perſons ſhe had it of, if he would quit her; and being as good as his word, they were likewiſe Seiz'd in their Lodging, and at this Seſſions found guilty of Felony; the Robery being Immaterial, ſince their Tryal was out of that County where the Fact was done.</p>
            <p>A Servant Girl about 15 years of Age, was Arraigned next, for conveying ſeveral ſorts of Goods out of her Miſtreſſes Houſe; but that Morning ſhe was to go from her, the Miſtreſs made bold to ſearch her Trunck, where ſhe found an Apron and two Sleeves, mark'd with her own Name; ſhe conclud,ed whatever elſe ſhe had lately loſt, went the ſame way: She brought her to her Tryal, where becauſe nothing elſe could be poſitively laid to her charge, and the Maid young enough to be taught more Honeſty; ſhe was brought in Guilty, but the Goods valued at 10 <hi>d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to have as many Flawgs.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman who had formerly belong'd to the Guard, was Indicted for lately Murdering his Companion at a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in <hi>Kings-ſtreet,</hi> the matter of Fact thus. The Decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed meeting the Priſoner accidentally, deſired him to take ſhare of a Pint of Wine, which the Priſoner would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have avoided; but in vain he endeavoured it, ſince th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Deceaſed would not part till they had Drunk together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which rather than give him any cauſe of Offence, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106975:3"/>
conſented to go with him: Whereupon they went in, and when the one Pint was Drunk off, the party now Dead called for another, and after that another; inſomuch that the Priſoner, who was then in haſt, told him, he would Drink no more, nor ſtay any longer in his Company: Whereupon the other perſon Drew, and went to Aſſault the Priſoner, who put by his Paſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and getting up to him, had forc'd him to ſit down in a Chair, and was holding by his Cravat with one hand, and his Sword in the other, when the Drawer came up; and taking particular notice of the Deceaſed, found his own Sword ſticking about five Inches deep in the Deceaſeds ſide; but he being a Quarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome perſon, and there being no ſign of Malice provd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, the Sword alſo in ſuch a Poſture, as if it fell ſo by Chance and not by Accident, he was brought in not Guilty.</p>
            <p>Another was Indicted for Murder, who by his Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Correcting of his Maid-Servant, was thought to be the Cauſe of her Death; but the Doctor and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion giving their Opinion that ſhe Dyed of an Impoſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; though the Maſter had uſed her ſeverely, he was brought in not Guilty.</p>
            <p>A Carpenter was afterwards Indicted for Murdering his Laborer, the manner thus. The Carpenter having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken a Piece of Wo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k, wherein he had occaſion to imploy Brick-layers and Maſons, one of them wanted a Tray full of Morter; and the Carpenter finding the reſt of his men buſie, whilſt this Laborer ſate Idling at an Ale houſe door, called him to Accommodate the Maſon with the ſaid Morter; but the Laborer inſtead of obeying him, gave him approbrious Language; and at laſt threw a great Stone at him, and was going to ſecond it with <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nother when the Carpenter taking up that which the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borer
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106975:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
firſt threw, and throwing it at him again, was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate as to hit the Laborer on the ſide of the Head, and break his Scull, whereof he preſently dyed; but there being no Malice found between them, (for the Laborer came to him but that day,) he was only found guilty of Man ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>The next was a perſon Indicted for Raviſhing a Maid about a Month ſince in <hi>Goſwel-ſtreet;</hi> the Girl ſeem'd to be a ſilly Country animal ſhe came up to <hi>London</hi> in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a place; but being diſappointed was ſitting at a door in the ſame Street, expecting the Waggoner to come by, that with him ſhe might return to her own Countrey: But in the interim it hapned that the Priſoner coming accidentally to the houſe where ſhe ſat, told her he wanted a Maid, and if ſhe was willing, would entertain her in his Service. Whereupon ſhe went along with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who as he was ſhewing her his Rooms above Stairs, and telling her what buſineſs ſhe muſt undergo, if ſhe lived with him: His Wife unluckily ſurpriz'd them; and it is th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ught, ſuſpecting ſome foul play, Beat the Countrey Girl out of doors, who it ſeems wanted not Inſtigators enow to adviſe her to revenge the diſappointment: For when ſhe came firſt out of this perſons houſe, and was examined by the Conſtable, ſhe proteſted ſhe had received no uncivil uſage from the Priſoner; but afterwardrs pretended a Rape: But the Fallacie being unvizarded, the Priſoner was brought in not Guilty.</p>
            <p>Two Gentlemen were Indicted for Murdering another Gentleman in <hi>Red-Lyon-Fields,</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 18<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> laſt. The ſum of the Evidence for the King was, they both were ſeen in the Quarrel, one of them to give the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed that Fatal Thruſt in the Breaſt which kil'd him, whilſt the other had his Sword drawn in the Defence of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106975:4"/>
him that did it. The Priſoner pleaded that the Deceaſed gave the Affront; that he that kil'd him, retreated many ſteps before he made a Paſs at him. But the Evidence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring as above, they were both found guilty of Man-ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>There was another man Indicted for having Carnal knowledge with a Young Girl about Nine years of Age; but none of the Evidence being able to prove the Fact; alſo the Chyrurgion proving the Childs Body had non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo much wrong as could make it a Rape, he was brought in not Guilty.</p>
            <p>A Young man was Indicted for Murdering a Woman in St. <hi>Margaret Moſes</hi> Parish <hi>Friday ſtreet,</hi> it appeared the Priſoner had been Bail for her, who had indeavoured to leave him in the Lurch; but he accidentally hearing of her Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, went with a Serjeant to apprehend her, but ſhe to avoid them, ran up to the Leads, and the Priſoner after her, which put her into ſuch a Fright, that ſhe jumpt off the ſaid Leads three Stories high into a Pav'd Yard, and dy'd with the Fall; But the Priſoner being not found to touch her, he was not found Guilty.</p>
            <p>Two Youths, the one about 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other about 13 years old, were Indicted for Robbing a Hoſier in St. <hi>Seulchers</hi> Pariſh of 15 <hi>l.</hi> the manner thus. Theſe light Finger'd blades having for ſome time had a deſign on this perſon, watcht their opportunity; on the 16<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> laſt, when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome urgent occaſion call'd out of his Shop, deſigning immediatly to return; the Leſſer of them ran to his Till or Caſhbox (which likewiſe happened to be unlockt) and took out of it Fifteen Pounds in ready Money, part of which he preſently disburſt in Apparel, and the Remainder kept to betray him; for as he was in an Ale-houſe boaſting of his Fortunate Adventures, it was his Misfortune to be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106975:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
over heard by a Souldier, who cauſed him to be Seiz'd by a Conſtable, and carried before a Juſtice who Committed him: The ſame Souldier had the Fortune to know the Party whom the had wrong'd, ſo that he and others who were then in his Company gave ſo ſatisfactory Evidence for the King, that the Jury could not but bring him in guilty of his Indictment.</p>
            <p>Two other Youths, were after theſe Indicted for Fellony, having in <hi>July</hi> laſt Stolen two Hogs, valued at 40 <hi>s.</hi> the Evidence againſt them was Evident, the Owner with ſome others having found them in the Priſoners Poſſeſſion, who had nothing to ſay in their Defence, but that they found them ſtragling in <hi>Pickadillie;</hi> but it being proved likewiſe by Subſtantial Witneſſes, that the Priſoners took them out of the Hog mans Yard, the Malefactors were without more ado pronounc'd Guilty.</p>
            <p>The perſon who as before I told you, was Indicted for making a Rape on the body of a ſmall Child of about 9 years of Age; being not found Guilty of that I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dictment, was notwithſtanding Arraigned again for a <hi>Treſpaſs:</hi> And though his Miſdemeanor could not reach the firſt Charge; yet it being found that he had much damnifi'd the body of the ſaid Child, he was therefore brought in Guilty of the Latter.</p>
            <p>The Maid who in <hi>July</hi> laſt was Arraigned for Preaching Blaſphemy, was then on her ſeeming Repentance, and Renouncing thoſe Blaſpemous Tenents <hi>that ſhe was God,</hi> &amp;c. which before ſhe fooliſhly affirmed; was on her bringing in Bale for her good Behaviour for the Future, reſtor'd to her Liberty: And as if ſhe had at the ſame time been Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed to Blaſpheme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fell to it a freſh, but not without ſome Alteration; for now being again Arraigned for the ſame Crime, ſhe had the Impudence before the whole

Court to ſay ſhe was indeed the Third perſonin the Trinity, and that her Father was that Chriſt, who was with God at the Creation; for which Impious Expreſſion, ſhe is likely to be Whipt into better Manners of Religion.</p>
            <p>There was a yonug man Indicted for ſtealing part of the Queens Plate out of her Dairy-houſe in S. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Park<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> he He confeſt the Fact before the Iuſtice; but in vain demed it here, for he had ſet his hand to it, and was deſervedly found Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In all were Condemned four men and ſix women, whereof one of the latter by a Jury of Women was found quick with Child. Sixteen men and one woman Burnt in the hand. Two women to be Whipt, and one to be Tranſported.</hi>
