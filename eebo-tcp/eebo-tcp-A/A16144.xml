            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is some time since (good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader) that lying in London, and preaching at Paules Crosse, as the feast of Easter drawing neer did admonish mee, I made choice to speake of the redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde by the death and bloud of Christ Iesus. And because that Citie then had, and yet hath, as manie learned and religious preachers; so some conceited and too much addicted to nouelties, who spared not in their Catechisings and readings, to vrge the suffering of the <hi>verie paines of hell</hi> in the soul of Christ on the crosse, as the chiefest part, and maine ground of our Redemption by Christ: I, finding how fast that opinion had increased, since it was first deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and doubting where it would end, thought it my dutie publikelie to warne them that were forward in defending this fansie, to take heed how farre they wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that late sprong speculation: For as these words of<note n="a" place="margin">Psa. 18. &amp; 116</note> 
               <hi>Dauid, The sorrowes of hell besieged me,</hi> and these of<note n="b" place="margin">Ionas. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Ionas, Out of the belly of hel I cried, &amp; thou heardest my voice,</hi> may be tolerablie applied to Christ, if they be metaphorically interpreted of Christ, as the scriptures meane them in <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ionas</hi>; so if wee grow from the figuratiue vse of the worde HELL, to the proper signification thereof, and rise from the degrees of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
<pb facs="tcp:2155:3"/>
and feares, which pursue the Saints in this life, to the highest sense and suffering of ALL, and THE VE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIE SAME paines and punishments which the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned do and shall endure for euer; freeing Christ from nothing but from the place and continuance of hell: vve make not a curious and superfluous, but an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and daungerous addition to the mysterie of our Saluation.</p>
            <p>The better to slacke their inconsiderate heate, I laboured to prooue these foure pointes vnto them. First that it was no where recorded in the holie Scriptures, nor iustlie to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Scriptures, that Christ suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the true paines of hell; and so the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of the faythfull coulde not iustlie bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the necessarie beleeuing of anie such strange assertion. Secondlie, that as the Scriptures describe to vs the paines of the damned and of hell; there are manie terrors and torments, which, without euident impietie, cannot be ascribed to the Sonne of God, as namely <hi>extreame Darkenesse, Desperation, Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, vtter separation, reiection and exclusion</hi> from the grace, fauour, and kingdome of God; <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> of sinne <hi>gnawing</hi> the conscience, <hi>horrour</hi> of Diuels tormented and tormenting, and <hi>flame</hi> of <hi>fire</hi> intolerablie burning both bodie and soule. Thirdlie, that the death and bloud of Christ Iesus were eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie, frequentlie, constantlie set downe in the writinges of the Apostles as the sufficient price of our Redemption, and true meane of our reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to God; and the verie same proposed in the
<pb facs="tcp:2155:3"/>
               <hi>figures,</hi> resembled in the <hi>sacrifices</hi> of the Lawe, and sealed with the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the new Testament as the verie grounde worke of our saluation by Christ; and so haue beene receaued and beleeued in the Church of God fourteene hundred yeares, before anie man euer made mention of hell paines to bee suffered in the soule of Christ. Lastlie, where the Scriptures are plaine and pregnant, that Christ <note n="c" place="margin">1. Corin. 13.</note> DIED: <hi>for our sinnes,</hi> and by his <note n="d" place="margin">Hebre. 2</note> DEATH, <hi>destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that had power of death, euen the Diuell, and reconciled vs, when we were strangers and enemies,</hi> IN THE<note n="e" place="margin">Colos. 1.</note> BODIE OF HIS FLESH THROVGH DEATH, (for wee are <hi>reconciled to God, by the</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Rom 5.</note> DEATH <hi>of his sonne, and sanctified by</hi> THE OFFERING OF THE <note n="g" place="margin">Hebr. 10.</note> BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIE <hi>of Iesus Christ</hi> once, who <note n="h" place="margin">1.

               <hi>himselfe bare our sinnes in his</hi> BODIE <hi>on the Tree</hi>: where hee <hi>was put to death concerning the</hi> FLESH;) Besides that the holie Ghost in these places by expresse wordes nameth the bodilie death of Christ as the meane of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reconciliation to God: no considerate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine might affirme or imagine Christ suffered the Death of the soule; for so much as the Death of the soule must exclude Christ from the <hi>grace, spirit,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of God; and leaue in him neither <hi>faith, hope,</hi> nor <hi>loue, sanctitie,</hi> nor <hi>innocencie</hi>; which God forbid anie Christian man shoulde so much as dreame. Wee shoulde therefore do well to reuerence the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest wordes of Gods Spirit in so high a pointe of Religion, and suffer our selues as schollers to bee taught by the leader into all trueth, what to beleeue and confesse in the mystery of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not to controle or correct the doctrine so
<pb facs="tcp:2155:4"/>
cleerelie deliuered in the Scriptures, so consonantlie retained of all learned and vnlearned in the Church of Christ, for so many hundred yeares. And if anie man to maintaine his deuise woulde inuent a newe hell and another death of the soule, then either scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or fathers euer heard or spake of, they shoulde keepe their inuentions to themselues; it sufficed me to beleeue what I read, and consequently not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue what I did not read in the word of God, which is and ought to be the foundation of our faith.</p>
            <p>Thus farre I purposed, when I first entered, by Gods grace to proceede in this cause, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> simple vnderstanding wherwith god hath endued me for the good of his Church. The article of the Creed, Christ DESCENDED INTO HELL I meant not to meddle with; choosing rather to leaue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vntouched, then to presse any sense as a point of faith, for vvhich I had not so full and faire warrant, as for the redemption of man by the death and blood of Christ Iesus; but the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of some contradicting that I taught, and the importunitie of others requesting to knowe what they might safelie beleeue of that article, made mee to alter my minde. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some vrged, others doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that if Christ did not suffer the paines of hell whiles he hung on the Crosse, that part of the Creed was added in vaine; and the wordes of <note n="i" place="margin">Psal. 16.</note>
               <hi>Dauid, Thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell,</hi> applied by <note n="k" place="margin">Acts 2.</note> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> vnto Christ in the second of the <hi>Acts,</hi> could hardly haue any good construction: (because it seemed farre fet, and altogither repugnant to the proper signification of the wordes, to take the <hi>soule</hi> for the <hi>bodie,</hi> and <hi>hell</hi> for the <hi>graue</hi>; and as for the locall descent of Christ
<pb facs="tcp:2155:4"/>
to hell after death, they counted that but a fable:) I was forced to promise that I would openlie deliuer, which I thought was the likeliest and safest sense, as well of that article in the Creede, as of those wordes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> fulfilled in the person of our Sauiour. This occasion drew mee to the next question of Christes descent to hell. Wherin I resolued as by perusing the later part of this treatise will better appeare, that Christs descent to the verie place of hell after his death, did best concord both with the Creede, and with the truth of Christian religion, so we tooke care not to swarue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Scriptures, in setting downe the cause why he went thither: which was to ouerthrow &amp; destroy the kingdom &amp; might of Satan in the place of his greatest strength, euen in hel, and as our head to free all his members from daunger and feare of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither: the sorrowes and terrors whereof hee loosed vvith his presence, treading them vnder his feete, and rose againe into a blessed and immortall life, leading captiuitie captiue, and taking from hell and Satan all povver to preuaile against his elect.</p>
            <p>Both these resolutions that Christ suffered <hi>not the true paines of hell in his soule on the crosse</hi>; and that hee <hi>personallie conquered</hi> and disarmed the <hi>powers</hi> and terrours <hi>thereof before his resurrection</hi>; some (as in such cases is common) misremembred, some miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued, and some misliked: vvhereupon I vvas both aduised and intreated by men of greater place then I vvill name, to put the effect of that vvhich I had deliuered in vvriting, that by mine ovvne vvords, and not by other mens conceits or reports, the learned might iudge of the doctrine. Which I did that verie
<pb facs="tcp:2155:5"/>
Summer, and had it readie for the presse before Bartle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewtide, but that the Parliament of States appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, wherein men shoulde be otherwise imploied; and a great hurle raised against it by certaine popular preachers in that citie, through whose mouthes the contrarie had often passed to the people as currant, I was desired by the same persons againe to staie, till that time of businesse were ouer past, that heat of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction somewhat alaied, and respite giuen that it might be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated into Latin, which also is now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as wel as published in English. To whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell I yeelded, referring the time wholy to their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, notwithstanding I were by many traduced in many places as a teacher of strange and false doctrine. But I haue beene and am the more willing to beare the reproches of maligners, because I seeke not my selfe heerein, but that the church of Christ heere in Englande should hold fast that ancient and sure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of faith which hitherto it hath kept; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that doctrine touching our Redemption by Christ, which as wel the publike lawes of this realme, as all the catholike fathers do vphold and allow.</p>
            <p>In setting downe the summe of that which I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, I neither do, nor can promise thee (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) the same words which I then spake; I wrote them not; but I assure thee before him that knoweth all things, that I haue not swarued nor altered anie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall point from the methode, propositions, proofes and conclusions, which I then vsed, nor from the wordes as farre as either my notes, or my memory vpon the fresh foote coulde direct mee; which I haue yet to shew. Manie proofes and authorities I omitted
<pb facs="tcp:2155:5"/>
in the pulpit, which the time shut me from; and some obiections I haue answered here more largelie, then the course of Sermons would permit: but here is the selfe same in effect, which then I vttered and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, if the time woulde haue suffered. The manner of handling this question, I alwaies wished might bee temperate and sober, as best became christian profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours and teachers; least by catching aduantages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the cause, wee increased quarrels, and so much regarded our credits that wee neglected the truth. I haue therfore in the Treatise it selfe touched no mans name, oppugned no mans wordes, traduced no mans iudgement; but admitting and retaining as much as I thought might stande with the truth, I haue pared off certaine extremities, and reiected certaine addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the first inuentors did refraine; for that Christ suffered the death of the soule, or all the same tormentes, which the damned do and shall, are posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions lately coined, and deriued from the proportion of Gods iustice as they call it, but as I thinke from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of mans reason intruding into Gods secrets. The doctrine which I defend, that we are sufficientlie redeemed by the death and bloud of Christ Iesus, (without adding of hell paines to bee suffered in the soule of Christ) hath the constant, full, and expresse warrant of the Scriptures, and the like approbation from al the fathers without exception. And therefore howsoeuer some men may despise all ancient writers, and frustrate the scriptures with their figures; al sober and wise christians will, I doubt not, beware how they admit this strange and late found nouelty into their Creede or consciences. The second point I presse nor
<pb facs="tcp:2155:6"/>
with like vehemencie, because it hath not like certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. So long as we confesse (which the Scriptures do confirme) that Christs humane nature after his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame humiliation on the Crosse, &amp; before his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, conquered &amp; spoyled not death only, but hell &amp; Satan also, of al their power &amp; right ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithful, &amp; ascending on hie <hi>lead captiuitie captiue,</hi> &amp; tooke the <hi>keyes of death and of hell</hi> into his owne hands; with the precise maner and hower I will not burden anie mans conscience, that cannot be perswaded by reading the latter part of this treatise; though I my selfe, after long &amp; diligent search, find no sense so agreeable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of the Creede, so answerable to the rules of the sacred Scriptures, and so fullie followed by all the Fathers, as Christs descent to the verie place of hell for the purposes aforesaid.</p>
            <p>Hauing premonished thee (Christian reader) of thus much, I am not willing to detayne thee anie longer from vewing and examining the booke it selfe, but onelie to tell thee that whiles I stayed the printing hereof, till others did like it, as wel as my self, one more hastie then either aduised or learned, calling himselfe H. I. would needes traduce it and confute it before he saw it, resting belike on such notes, as his angry mind and brickle memorie tooke at the time when I preached of these points. Wherein though others condemne his follie, yet I commend his pollicie, that least hee should trouble himselfe with more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he could answere, he thought it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best way to come into the field alone, and like a stout Champion fighting with his owne shadow, to say no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would be sure to deny or decline with one
<pb facs="tcp:2155:6"/>
shift or other. To make the easier conquest of that I preached, hee cleane changeth the state of the first Question, hee offereth to prooue that which I neuer denied, hee confuteth that which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer affirmed, hee runneth at Random no man can tell whither, hee peruerteth my wordes, hee may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth my reasons, hee skippeth all my authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; hee scornefullie reiecteth the iudgement of the Fathers when I alleage them, the Scriptures hee turneth and windeth at his pleasure, he wadeth desperately through thicke and thinne in matters of most importance, his best reason is euerie where his own opinion, outfacing the world with his ignorance; in summe, he sheweth vs by his example what it is for a man in matters of faith to despise both authoritie and antiquity, and trust onely to his own fancie. Such an opponent the wiser sort will thinke I were better neglect then encounter, which resolution I my selfe do retayne; onely lest my silence should augment his boldnes, I thought it not amisse in the conclusion se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the treatise, to giue thee a tast of the rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and weaknes of his enterprise, intreating thee in the meane time to reade aduisedly and iudge indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, for that the cause is weighty and toucheth thee as neere as mee. For if we suffer the mayne foundation of our faith and hope in Christ to be wrenched neuer so little awrie; the whole building is more endangered then wee are ware of. In Gods causes, let Gods booke teach vs what to beleeue, and what to professe. If thou thinke it thy duetie in matters of faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of vnwritten verities, in the greatest point of all, which is our redemption by Christ; take heede
<pb facs="tcp:2155:7"/>
thou easilie admit not vnwritten absurdities. This matter began in more generall and more tolerable tearmes, if they might bee rather soberly mitigated, then too vehemently pressed; but as when we runne downe an hill we can hardly staie; so in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion when we fal to inuenting beyond the scriptures we quickly misse and seldome recouer the truth. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well (gentle Reader) and pray that our thoughts and wits may be subiected to the truth of Gods word, and that wee loath not the simplicitie which is in Christ.</p>

The first is and must be in all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie; and chieflie in Christ himselfe: For the more we loue God, the more wee detest and shunne all separation from God. Hell therefore which is an vtter exclusion from the kingdome of God, is most iustlie abhorred of all his saints, and speciallie of his owne Son: who not onelie by will, but by nature is one with his Father. A conflict with Hell
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2155:12"/>
if it come not from the inward motion of the mind, is but a temptation to trie the heart, or shew the strength of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. So was <hi>Adam</hi> tempted in Paradise by <hi>Eue,</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> by the Serpent, to prooue howe mindfull they were, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full they would be for the blessings of God bestowed vpon them. So was Christ tempted in the wildernesse by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and all his life long by the wicked, which were to him but occasions to declare the innocencie and integritie of his humane nature. But the inwarde temptation of the heart and conscience, though it bee in all the children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> (the elect themselues not excepted,) by reason of their flesh lusting agaynst the spirite, their conscience accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them for sinne, and their fayth sometimes fainting; yet in Christ wee must graunt no such thing, because in him there was neither corruption of flesh, nor remorse of sinne, nor weakenesse of faith, that shoulde anie kinde of waie bréede or yeelde to the worme, that gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at our consciences. <hi>A desperate feare</hi> is when the wrath of God awaketh the wicked to knowe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, what vengeance is prepared for them, in the life to come, and so hauing lost both fayth and hope, they fall to an horrible expectation of iudgement, and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fyre, which shall deuoure the aduersarie. But yet euen these men, whose case is most despaired, are not while they liue heere on earth, in the true paines of Hell, but are as farre from that, as expecting is from suffering. The last I knowe not howe to call, but by the name of a damned, rather paine, then feare; which the wicked departed this life doe presentlie feele. For paine that is present, inflicteth rather torment, then feare; since feare is properlie the trembling at euill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come, and not the grieuing at it, when it is come. Of these foure impressions, yee see which I attribute vnto Christ, and which not. Despairing, or so much as doubting of his saluation, we cannot ascribe to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euident impietie. And as for Christes suffering the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2155:12"/>
same paines which the damned soules in Hell doe, to my simple vnderstanding, it is rather a dreame then a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to bee taught in the Church of Christ. Did they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende <hi>as great</hi> sense and anguish of paine to haue beene in Christes bodie or soule, as <hi>hell</hi> fire doth inflict to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, though that were a verie presumptuous and audacious position, yet is it not so impious, as when they affirme he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>the self same</hi> which the damned do. For the damned haue many sorts of paines in hel, which by no means could fasten on Christs person; and since there be degrées of paine in hell euen for the damned; these curious teachers must shewe vs which of these degrees Christ suffered, &amp; by what warrant of gods word, they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note>In the causes, why Christ should suffer the paines of hell, we may do well not to be too forwarde with the rules of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: as well for that there is no proportion betwixt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ and vs, as also for that wee may not sit iudges with God, and prescribe when or howe his iustice should bee satisfied. It is requisite in our selues to confesse that as both parts of man sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> so the wages of sinne, which is euerlasting death, is due to both: and as the soule shoulde haue principallie enioied God, which is her life, if shee had persisted in obedience; so in falling from God, her losse, and smart, must of the twaine bee farre the greater; though the bodie shall not wante both grieuaunce and vengeance intolerable: but if wee stretch these rules to Christ, and subiect his person, as our suretie, to the verie <hi>SAME WAGES</hi> of sinne, which we should haue suffered, I knowe not howe in fewer wordes a man maie couch more grosse and open impiety. For we should haue béene <hi>WHOLY SEVERED, IVSTLY HATED,</hi> and <hi>VTTERLY REIECTED</hi> from God, yea <hi>ETERNALLY CONDEMNED BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIE AND SOVLE,</hi> to hell fire.

But if death bee not fearefull to the seruants of Christ, as indéede it is not, they are the more bound to their Lord and master, who in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to make the waie easie for them, with the losse of his life disarmed death for euer, and brake the chaines in sunder wherewith death and hell were coupled together.

Then if out of these wordes we will infer, that Christes soule was truelie forsaken of God, it cannot bee auoided, but this inwarde perswasion in Christ (that his soule was forsaken) during from the time of his agonie in the garden, till his complaint on the crosse (which was aboue 18. houres) was manifest desperation: vnlesse wee saie Christ was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in so thinking, which is as great an errour on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side.

            <p>Then are there in the sacred scriptures neither anie <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi> that Christ shoulde suffer the paines of hell in his soule here on earth; nor <hi>causes</hi> why he must suffer them; nor <hi>Signes</hi> that he did suffer them; and consequentlie, whatsoeuer is pretended, no proofe that these sufferings must be added to the crosse of Christ, before the worke of our saluation can be perfect. And for my part, which moderation I wish in you all, <hi>What I reade in the word of God that I beleeue, what I do not reade that I doe not beleeue.</hi> In Gods causes wee maie not easily leaue Gods words, and with a new kind of speach make way for a new kinde of faith.

By Christs obedience I doe not meane the holinesse of his life, or performance of the lawe, but the obedience of the person vnto death, euen the death of the Crosse; which was volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarilie offered by him, not necessarily imposed on him, aboue and besides the lawe, and no way required in the lawe. For it could be no dutie to God or man, but onelie mercie and pitie towardes vs, that caused the sonne of God to take our mortall and weake flesh vnto him, and therein, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to pay the ransome of our sinnes, and to purchase eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life for vs. He must be a Sauiour, no debter; a redéemer, no prisoner; Lord of all, euen when hee humbled himselfe to be the seruant of all; his diuine glorie, power and maiestie make his sufferings to be of infinite force and value. And from this dignitie, and vnitie of his person, which is the maine pillar of our redemption, if we cast our eies on any

Fairer or fuller causes of our redemption we neede not aske, the holie Ghost doth not expresse, God cannot haue.

            <p>What was the true propitiatorie sacrifice which God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for the sinnes of the world,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The true sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for sinne was shadowed in the figures and sacrifices of the former testament.</hi>
               </note> if the new testament did not plainelie declare, the olde testament would sufficientlie witnesse vnto vs. For as well Patriarks as Prophets, yea all the godlie from <hi>Abel</hi> to Christ did by their sacrifices and seruice of God professe and confirme their faith to be this, that they looked for the Seede of the woman, who by his death and bloud should purge their sinnes, and make peace betwéene God and them. This was the promise of grace which God made in Paradise to our first parents, threatning the serpent with the séede of the woman in these words; <note n="t" place="margin">
                  <hi>Genes.</hi> 32</note> 
               <hi>He shall crush thine heade, and thou shalt bruise his heele.</hi> As the heele of man is the basest part of his bodie, and nearest the earth; so the Serpent shoulde bruise the weakest and earthliest part of Christ; but euen that bruized heele should bee of force enough to crush the Serpentes head. For by the flesh of Christ wounded, and bloud shed, the power &amp; pride of satan should be conquered and confounded. This sence of Gods promise made to his parents, <hi>Abell</hi> the first mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr by faith accepted, by sacrifice adored; and in that respect his <hi>bodilie</hi> and <hi>bloudie offering</hi> was preferred before his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2155:35"/>
brothers. This faith did all the Patriarkes testifie by their bloudie sacrifices, that they expected the bodie of the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to be bruized, and his bloud to be shed for the remission of their sinnes. And as they receiued it from their fathers, so they deliuered it to their children for the shoot anchor of all their hope. This God did ratifie by his lawe written, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his people to haue no sacrifices for sinne, but such as represented the bloudie offering of Christ on the crosse. So that <hi>all the sacrifices</hi> and <hi>sacraments</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> lawe were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but figures and <note n="u" place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebre</hi> 9</note> 
               <hi>examples of better thinges,</hi> as the Apostle calleth them, namelie of Christes bodie once to bee offered, and his bloud once to bee shed for the abolishing of sinne. The <hi>FIGVRES</hi> of Christ before and vnder the lawe, what else doe they point, but to the death, bloud, and crosse of Christ to be the redemption and saluation of all mankinde? <hi>Abrahams</hi> readinesse to offer vp <hi>Isaac,</hi> for which the blessing was annexed to him with an othe, what doth it import but the loue of God <note n="x" place="margin">

Christ hanging on the crosse to cure our soules from the poison of sinne, which is the sting of that deadlie serpent? The strength of <hi>Sampson</hi> pulling the house on his owne and his enemies heades, doth it not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the voluntarie death of Christ, to be the destruction of death and hell, which insulted at him on the crosse?</p>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2155:35"/>
But which of these two was <hi>beleeued</hi> of the Patriarks, <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed</hi> by the sacrifices, <hi>shadowed</hi> in the figures of the law, <hi>expected</hi> of the faithfull from the foundation of the worlde? The bloudie sacrifice of Christes bodie is so plainelie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by them all, that there can bee no question of their faith and expectation. And were they deceiued in the obiect of their faith, and hope? Did they all mistake the true sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for their sinnes? and did God by his lawe confirme them in that errour? And doeth the Apostle falselie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from the sacrifices of the lawe, that Christes offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring before it coulde take awaie sinne, must of force bee bloudie? These were verie strange positions in Christian religion, and yet I sée not howe wee shall auoide them, if we strictlie maintaine the suffering of hell paines to bee the <hi>chiefer</hi> and <hi>principaller</hi> part of our redemption, without which the rest is nothing. If their faith fastened on the death and bloud of Christ for the remission of their sinnes did saue them, then was the death of Christ of force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, without the paines of Hell to release them from their sinnes; and bring them vnto God. And if it wrought that effect in them, it is still of the same power and strength to worke the like in vs. If it were insufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease them from the rigour of GODS wrath, then are the Patriarkes perished in their sinnes, by mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the true price of their redemption. For that they knewe anie thing of Christs suffering Hell paynes, I thinke will hardlie bee prooued. But out of question their faith was right which was settled on the bloud of Christ to bee shedde for the redéeming of their sinnes; and themselues are Saintes in Gods kingdome: Wee must therefore take heede that wee doe not rashlie varie from the foundation of their faith and hope; which must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be ours, with this onelie difference, that they beléeued in him, which should take away the sins of the worlde by his death and crosse, and we in him that hath taken them away.

And in this sort Christ bought vs with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud from the daunger of sinne and hell; not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, but suffering Satan by the hands of the Iewes to take his life from him; neither compounding with his aduersarie, but repressing him in the middest of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, who assaulting Christ Iesus our head, as he had done all the members was ouerthrowne by him, and vanquished with an euerlasting victorie.</p>

            <p>The first is the verie same, which I haue alreadie handled, and refused as not consonant to the christian faith; but rather repugnant to the dignitie, certainty, sanctity of Christs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, coniunction, &amp; communion with God.

For they may be <hi>tossed</hi> with the <hi>waues</hi> of temptation, rising from the <hi>remembrance</hi> of sinne, &amp; <hi>remorse</hi> of conscience; but our Sauiour, as he was frée from all <hi>touch</hi> of sinne, so was he from all <hi>feare</hi> of heart, that hee should or might bee reiected from Gods fauour, or adiudged to euerlasting death. <hi>Smart, paine</hi> and <hi>griefe</hi> of bodie or minde, be it neuer so <hi>great,</hi> will commende his obedience and patience; but the <hi>SENSE</hi> of damnation or separation from God, or the <hi>FEARE</hi> or <hi>DOVBT</hi> thereof in Christ, as they quench faith, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish grace, so they dissolue the vnion and communion of both his natures; or else bréede a false perswasion, and sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full temptation in the soule of Christ.

bee no apprehension of hell paines as <hi>due</hi> vnto him, or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> for him, without renouncing his innocencie, and leauing the vnitie of his person; and consequentlie hee must <hi>find</hi> or <hi>feare,</hi> that God would be <hi>inconstant,</hi> and <hi>vniust</hi>; which are more then hainous impieties.

So also God the father now taketh vnto him the PERSON not of a father, but OF A TYRANT; though in heart hee were most louing vnto Christ.

               </note> for that <hi>SHEOL</hi> in the olde testament doth most commonlie, if not continuallie signifie the graue.

Though therefore this exposition cannot be charged with falsitie, for Christ was trulie buried; yet may it not bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by reason of the <hi>idle repetition,</hi> and <hi>strange circumlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quution,</hi> which troubleth and confoundeth the hearer; besides the improprietie and incoherence of the worde, that a <hi>deade corps</hi> should <hi>descend,</hi> and speciallie <hi>vnto hell.</hi>
            </p>

I see well enough what they woulde faine decline; but what if by their farre fet exposition they fall into that errour which they seeke to flie? Doe they not fairelie profer, and quite besides the marke? Let vs looke a little into their conceite. Christ <hi>descended into hell,</hi> that is, saie they, his soule after death, conuersed among the soules of the iust, that were dead before him. But where were the soules of the iust? In a place, or no? Without a place can nothing be, but onelie God. All creatures be they soules or angels are desined with place, though they doe not reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish their places as bodies do; yea what soeuer is <hi>not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed</hi> within a place, is <hi>infinite</hi>; which no creature can bee. The soules then of the righteous must of necesstie bee in a place. And what call you that place by your opinion? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth euen <hi>HELL.</hi> For Christs descending into hell, as you expound it, was his conuersing among the soules of the dead. Those soules then were <hi>in a place,</hi> and <hi>that place</hi> by your construction the Creed calleth <hi>Hell.</hi> Their state you will say, is called hell, but not their place. A wittie difference I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you. The place for soules after this life, is answerable to their state. If their state bee hell, their place can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee Heauen, nor Paradise. As is their <hi>receptacle,</hi> so is their <hi>rest</hi>; the place doth bring either <hi>ioy</hi> or <hi>paine,</hi> which is their state. So that if Christ descending into hell conuersed with the soules of the righteous; of force the soules of the righteous were in hell, which is the selfe same errour, that you woulde seeme by your newe founde

               <hi>Ne ipsos quidem INFEROS VSPIAM scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum locis IN BONO APPELLATOS potuireperire. Quod si nusquam in diuinis authoritatibus legitur, non vtique sinus ille Abrahae, idest, secretae cuiusdam quietis habitatio ALIQVA PARS INFERORVM esse credenda est: quanquam in ijs ipsis tanti magistri verbis, vbi ait dixisse Abraham, Inter nos &amp; vos chaos magnum firmatum est; SATIS VT OPINOR APPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RET, NON ESSE QVANDAM PARTEM, ET QVASI MEMBRVM INFERORVM, tantae illius felicitatis sinum: Chaos enim magnum, quid est nisi quidam hiatus multum ea se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parans, inter quae non solum est, verum etiam firmatus est? The name of Inferi I could no where finde in anie place of scripture vsed IN ANY GOOD SENSE: which if wee doe no where reade in the authorities of the scripture, surelie Abrahams bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, which is an habitation of secret rest, may not be thought to bee ANY PEECE OF THE LOVVER PARTS albeit in the words of so sufficient a maister</hi> (as our Sauiour) <hi>where he maketh Abraham say, betwixt vs and you there is a GREATE GVLFE ESTABLISHED, it is EVIDENT ENOVGH, as I take it; that the bosome of so great felicitie, is NO PART NOR MEMBER of hell. For what is a great gulfe, but a great distance separating those places, betweene which it lieth? Inferi</hi> are the lower parts where the deade remaine, which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew calleth <hi>Sheôl</hi>; and touching <hi>Inferi,</hi> which are the <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> or <hi>spirits beneath,</hi> we maie with <hi>S. Austen</hi> conclude two thinges out of the manifest wordes of our Sauiour. First that <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome is <hi>VPVVARD</hi> towards heauen, and therfore the soules of the righteous before the death of Christ
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2155:83"/>
               <hi>ascended</hi> rather, then <hi>descended.</hi> Next, that neither paradise, nor <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, (which was the receptacle for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soules of all the sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that held the faith, and did the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi>) was anie part or member of hell. So that <hi>CHRISTS DESCENDING INTO HELL</hi> cannot be expounded of his conuersing with the <hi>spirites of the iust and perfect men</hi> after his death; nor of his enduring the <hi>state of the deade</hi>; since the place, where their soules doe rest after death, is no where in the scriptures called <hi>HELL</hi> or <hi>SHEOL,</hi> or, as <hi>S. Austen</hi> speaketh, <hi>INFERI.</hi> And this I take to be so cleere, that neither Iewish <hi>Rabbines</hi> with their grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call obseruations, nor Gréeke <hi>poets</hi> with their fantasticall imaginations may be suffered to contradict it. Howe easie it is to wrangle with the words, <hi>NEPHESH, SHEOL,</hi> and <hi>HADES</hi> a meane scholar maie soon perceiue; but I hold it no sound course to fetch the explication of the mysteries of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion, either from such impudent impugners of it, as were the <hi>Rabbines,</hi> or from such ignorant deluders of it, as were the prophane <hi>poets,</hi> who talke euerie where of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and hell, according to the false and lewde perswasion of their own hearts. And therfore they may spare their paines, that promise vs so manie thousand deponentes both Iewish and heathen, that <hi>Sheol</hi> and <hi>Hades</hi> do not signifie hell. It wil trouble them more then they thinke, to bring vs but one good proofe out of the scripture, that the soules of the righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christs comming, were in <hi>Sheol</hi> or <hi>Hades</hi>; and till they doe, I rest on <hi>Saint Austens</hi> collection out of the wordes of Christ; that <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome is no péece nor part of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> or <hi>Inferi,</hi> which the hebrew calleth <hi>Sheol,</hi> as being deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from it with a mightie distance; and that the soules of the iust departing this life before Christs death, were <note n="y" place="margin">

It is then on all sides accorded, that hell and Satan must be fullie conquered by Christ, before the worke of our redemption can be perfectlie setled or assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but as well the <hi>time when,</hi> as the <hi>maner, how,</hi> are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what questioned, and that maketh the whole matter the more néedfull to he discussed.

It remained for the full effecting of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that man assumed of God without sinne, shoulde thither descend, whither man seuered from God fell by desert of sinne: that is, vnto hell, where the soule of the sinner was woont to bee tormented, and to the graue, where the flesh of the sinner was woont to bee corrupted; yet so, that neither Christes flesh shoulde bee corrupted in the graue, nor his soule bee tormented with the paines of hell; because the soule free from sinne was not to be subiected to that punishment, nor flesh cleane from the contagion of sinne shoulde suffer corruption. In so much as man sinning deserued by punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bee seuered from himselfe, who by his transgression woulde needes bee seuered from God, therefore it was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the death of the sinner should bring his sinfull flesh to the graue, there to rotte; and presentlie should send his soule to hell, there to be tormented.

The first is, <hi>THE PLACE, VVHITHER</hi> he desended; the next is, <hi>THE CAVSE, VVHY</hi> he descended. The <hi>place</hi> whither hee descended was <hi>hell</hi>; whither the soule of man sinning against God was adiudged for the wages of his transg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ession. The <hi>cause</hi> of his descent, was to free all the faithfull from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world to the ende thereof from comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And in both these, the Scriptures and fathers doe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie concurre; though some auncient writers doe swarue, and striue about Christes deliuering some from hell, that were there at the time of his descent, as they suppose. Which varietie and vncertaintie of opinions concerning the state of the deade before Christes comming hath verie much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled this question, and induced manie men of learning and iudgement otherwise, to reiect. Christs descent to hell as a fable, or to wrest it to an other sense, with newe founde expositions. Howbeit I see no cause, but the doctrine of the Scriptures confessed by all the fathers may stande verie cleare, whatsoeuer we resolue of this other assertion, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the state of the righteous departed this life before Christs death. I will therefore shortly discusse both the place and the cause, and so draw to an end.</p>
            <p>As for the place whither Christ descended, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gréedily hunteth after it, to heare of her Purgatorie; hoping, whence the soules of the righteous were by Christ deliuered, there to make a stand for soules, not perfectlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and absolued in this life; that she maie set to sale her praiers and pardons.

If these three bee not abolished by Christ, Satans kingdome is not destroyed by Christ; and speciallie if hell bee not vanquished; no part of our saluation is performed. The woorke of sinne is sweete, if the wages were not sower, which is hell fire. To raise our bodies from death, is no fauour, if Hell bee not ouerthrowen; it were more easie for them to lie in dust, then to burne in hell. Howe hath Christ restored vs to Heauen, if hee haue not yet freed vs from Hell? Or brought vs to God, if he haue not yet taken vs from Satan? Wherefore either Hell must bee destroyed, or wee are no waie redeemed, And in all these, when I speake of Hell, I speake of the place of the damned.

In this the whole church might consent, that <hi>Adams</hi> sinne was <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased,</hi> and <hi>Adams</hi> bandes <hi>loosed</hi> by Christs descent to hell; but other tradition, what soules were in hell, and thence deliuered at Christes comming, as it was altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to men on earth, and consequentlie most vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, so is it rather presumptuous to define, then religious to beléeue.</p>

gehennae, eras mecum eris? His duobus titulis subtilitatem falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae suae prodidit improuidus Satan, quia &amp; adorari se permisit sub habitu &amp; nomine Samuelis contra legem: &amp; virum peccatis pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum, cum magna distantia peccatorum &amp; iustorum sit, cum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muele iustissimo futurum mentitus est. Ad eum enim transmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit (Saul) quem adorauit. I take it to be a wicked act, if we acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge the storie according to the words. For how could it be that a man holie in birth, and iust in life should bee drawne</hi> (from the place of his rest) <hi>by the power of a witch? If he were not drawne</hi> (against his will) <hi>hee consented</hi> (to come;) <hi>both which are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to beleeue of so iust a person. And this is the sleight of Satan, that to deceiue the more, hee maketh as if the iust were in his hands. The storie doth describe the mind of Saul, and the shew of Samuel, expressing what was seene and said, but pretermitting how true or false either was. For what saith it? Saul hearing in what habite</hi> (the spirite) <hi>was raised, vnderstoode it to be Samuel. It reporteth what (Saul) conceiued, and because hee concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued amisse, hee adored another then God, against the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and thinking it to bee Samuel, worshipped the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, that Satan might reape the fruite of his fallacie. For if Samuel had indeede appeared vnto him, the iust person woulde neuer haue suffered himselfe to bee worshipped, which preached God alone to be worshipped. And how did the man of god, that was with Abraham in rest, say to that pestilent man, worthie of hell fire, to morrowe thou shalt bee with me? By these two wayes Satan afore he was ware betraied his fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent subtiltie, because he suffered himselfe to be worshipped vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the habite and name of Samuel, against</hi> (Gods) <hi>lawe; and lied, that Saul loden with sinne should after death be with righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Samuel, whereas there is a great distance betwixt the iust and vniust</hi> (after this life;) <hi>and Saul went hence to him, whom he worshipped.</hi>

His first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection is answered in the text it selfe.

               <q>This (<hi>saith hée</hi>) is not onely an obiection, but euen a foundation and principall ground of this errour, but so mistaken and forced as nothing may be more. <hi>My reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hée maketh to be this</hi>; Christs soule was not crucified but only his bodie; therefore Christs bodie onlie suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and not his soule.</q>
By this (gentle reader) it may plainlie be perceiued, how well this gainsaier obserued my proofs.

               </gap>ter after his forgetfull maner roueth at. The first in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was this. The true sacrifice for sinne, which the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer should offer, was shadowed and foreshewed by the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices which God commanded and accepted in the old testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but the sacrifices of the Patriarches and of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full appointed by <hi>Moses</hi> foreshewed and figured a bodilie, bloudie, and deadlie sacrifice, and no paines of hell; therfore the true sacrifice for sinne was made by the bodie, bloud and death of the Redéemer, and not by the paines of hell suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his soule. The second this; As the sacrifices of the law prefigured what the Sauiour of the world should do for the abolishing of sinne; so the sacraments of the newe testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confirme and scale that performed in the person of Christ Iesus, which was the true propitiation for our sinnes, and price of our redemption: but the sacraments of the new testament, and speciallie the Lordes supper, declare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vnto vs the bodie of Christ giuen for vs vnto death, and his bloud shed for the remission of our sinnes; therefore this was the true propitiation for our sinnes, and price of our redemption, and not the paines of hell suffered in the soule of Christ, as some imagine. To the first the Confuter answereth; <note n="r" place="margin">

               <q>The proposition is false taking it generally. The carnall sacrifices of the Iewes signified that which they were apt to signifie, but not anie further.

               <q>These are bodilie and earthlie Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therefore fitte to set soorth bodilie and apparant ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in Christ; they can not set out the spirituall and inuisible effects in him.

These I trust are your words; now heare my replie. I had no such proposition as you frame to your selfe, that either the sacrifices of the lawe, or Sacraments of the Gospel, were figures of our whole and absolute redemption, which is (as you expound it) of all the fruits and causes of our redemption. This is your eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, not my proposition; I tolde you that as God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, so the faithfull beléeued, that his owne sonne should be the Seede of the woman, and by his death and bloud should purge their sinnes. To continue this promise and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the faith of all before and vnder the lawe, God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed bloudie sacrifices, as continuall remembrances and figures, not of the person, nor of the function of Christ; but of the Sacrifice, by which hee shoulde abolish sinne; to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

My propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition then speaketh of the true sacrifice for sinne, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth that to bee the true sacrifice for sinne, which was shadowed and figured by the death and bloud of those beasts, that God comma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is no waie denied or doubted by mee, that the soule of Christ was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and tormented with sorrow and paine all the time of his passion; which this Trister so much laboureth to proue; and therefore if the holocaust did signifie the whole manhood of Christ suffering for our sinnes, it could not preiudice anie thing, that I did or doe teach, as anon thou shalt (gentle Reader) more plainlie perceiue; but yet whie the burning of the holocaust should signifie Christes affliction on the Crosse, either in bodie or soule, I see no proofe made by this Confuter; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No man euer burned with this fire comparable to Christ Iesus; whose loue towardes God and man flamed, as vnto death, so after death, most feruentlie. So that touching the holocaust the Confuter presumeth but proueth nothing; and yet if his supposall were granted, it weakeneth not the force of my reason, since by the bodily and bloudie sacrifice shado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in the law, I do not exclude the torments on the crosse imparted to the soule, or rather wholy discerned by the soule of Christ, but onelie the paines of hell which were neuer fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by anie sacrifice, nor scaled by anie Sacrament of the old or new testament, though now they bee made the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall part of our redemption, which indéede was purchased by the death and bloud of Christ Iesus.</p>
            <p>In auoiding the reason which I drewe from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the new testament, and namelie from the Lordes Supper, in the length of six lines (Sir refuter) you contradict the definition and institution of that Sacrament, as also the plaine resolution of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the principles of naturall reason. <q>The Sacraments (you saie) <hi>are earthlie elements, they cannot set out spirituall and inuisible effects in Christ.</hi>

               </q>Good Sir remember, Redemption from death is the point which I vrged; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our bodies in this life haue not, no more then the bodies of Infidels haue, but must expect it.
And therefore if our Soules be not redeemed by the blood of Christ from Sinne &amp; death, we haue presentlie no redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the bloud of Christ, but must staie for the time of our resurrection before we shall haue it.

Now then for the former, thus we saie and constantly auow: Christ Iesus did suffer in his whole manhoode for the redemption and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of our sinnes: yea he suffered properly and immediatelie in his soule and not in his flesh only. Therefore he suffered for vs the wrath of God. This consequent is manifest and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. The antecedent or first part of the former generall reason is denied and confidentlie reiected yet how falselie by Gods helpe shal

easily appeare.</q>
Touching the first part of this controuersie; were you awaked or a sléepe (Sir refuter) when I preached of these thinges, that you so constantlie auowe this was the question, whether Christ suffered for vs th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wrath of God or no? if you were present and not a sleepe, it is too much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to outface the world in print, that this was the position which I impugned. There were too manie witnesses there, for mee to denie, or you to belie, the question; you knowe it well enough, but you cannot tell how to proue that which I then reproued, and therefore you shrink from that, and dallie with generall and doubtfull termes, which according as they are expounded, may either make with you, or against you. The question proposed by me, was, <hi>whether it could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the scriptures, or by necessary consequent from them, that Christ in his soule suffered the true paines of hell such as the damned doe suffer, and wee shoulde haue suffered, had we not beene redeemed by him</hi>? I added, if we tooke the paines of hell metaphoricallie for great and extreame sorrowes and paines, as <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ionas</hi> did, she speach might be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated; but if wee tooke them properlie for the verie same which the damned doe and shall suffer in hell, as there is no proofe for it, so there is no truth in it. To this you saie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and so to all wise men make a confession that you cannot iustifie that, which I then disallowed. Ye bee come since to tell vs that certainelie Christ suffered the wrath of God for vs; which if it be granted you, I doe not see what it canne helpe your cause, or hurt mine. For the wrath of God extendeth to all paines and punishmentes as well cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall as spirituall, in this life and the next, be they tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall or eternall. So that no paine or punishment small or great coulde befall the bodie or soule of Christ, but it must néedes procéed from the wrath of God. Wherefore your idle discourse of 32. leaues, in which you labor to proue that Christ suffered the wrath of God for sinne, might wel haue bin spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Thrée lines directlie to the purpose had bin more worth
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:2155:129"/>
then so many leaues thus wastfullie spent.
But in the ende you conclude like a Clark, Christ suffered the wrath of God, <q>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 33.</note> 
                  <hi>which we affirme is equall to hell it selfe, and all the tormentes thereof.</hi>
               </q>
What you affirme I little regarde; what you can proue is that I intend. And out of this proposition Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for vs the wrath of God for sinne, you shall neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; <hi>Ergo</hi> hee suffered the true paines of hel. Were your proposition generall shal Christ suffered all the wrath of God for sinne, that is the whole wrath of God and euery part thereof due to sinne, you might well conclude; <hi>Ergo</hi> he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the true paines of hell; for hell indéede as it is the last, so is it the greatest effect of Gods wrath against sin; but from an indefinite proposition as yours is, which maie signifie the <hi>VVHOLE</hi> or <hi>SOME PART</hi> of <hi>GODS VVRATH</hi> due to sinne, you shall neuer inferre what part you list, as here you doe.</p>
            <p>Will you, to make your consequent good, amend your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent and make it generall; that Christ suffered the whole wrath of God, &amp; euery part thereof due to sinne? Then heare good Sir, mine answere. That proposition, besides that it no waie followeth vpon your first antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; Christ suffered properlie and immediatlie in his soule, therefore he suffered the whole wrath of God and euery part thereof due to sinne: besides I saie that there is no coherence, no consequence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these two propositions; the later of them, that Christ suffered the whole wrath of God due to sinne, and euery part thereof, is most <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>blasphemous.</hi> For so neither <hi>vtter desperation,</hi> nor <hi>finall reiection,</hi> nor <hi>eternal damnation</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, but Christ did and must suffer them all; since they are partes, yea the chiefest partes and effectes of Gods wrath against sinne. This is far from your meaning, as you often protest. Trulie I beléeue it; charitie leades me to thinke, though you be somewhat foolish in this cause, that yet you are not so diuelish as to fasten these things on the sonne of God. But you must also be so wise as to sée, that if your antecedent
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:2155:129"/>
be general these wil follow, whether you mean them or no: if your antecedent be not general, but indefinite, as, Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the wrath of God due to sinne, that is some partes and effectes of Gods wrath due to sinne, you shall neuer make choise in your conclusion which parts he suffered, as namelie the true paines of hel &amp; of the damned. Now choose which you will, either the inualiditie of your argument, or the impietie of your antecedent; the one will proue you to lack learning, that you sée not the difference; the other that you want chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, if you should not with mouth disclaim, and with hart detest that horrible blasphemie.</p>
            <p>You wil pretend I know, your conclusion is not general: no more indeed is it; your words are, <q>
                  <hi>therfore Christ suffered for vs the wrath of God</hi>;</q>but this conclusion beeing indefinite, and verie doubtfull, will do you no good in the fortifieng of your cause.
For Christ may suffer the wrath of God in his bodie, yea in his soule hee maie suffer it, and yet not the paines of the damned, or of hell: but because you make this the maine foundation of your whole matter, let vs looke somewhat better into it. You labour to proue by a long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse that Christ suffered the wrath of God for sinne. First then what meane you by the wrath of God?

               <hi>nomine irae intelligitur vindicta iniquitatis, by the name of</hi> (Gods) <hi>wrath is vnderstoode the punishment of iniquitie.</hi> It is then eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that by the name of (Gods) <hi>wrath,</hi> throughout the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is vnderstoode the vengeance or punishment prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or inflicted for the sinnes of men. Nowe what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar punishmentes God hath prouided for sinne as well in this life, as the next, to chastise and reuenge both the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and soules of sinners, woulde aske long time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse. The greatest and foarest are these iudgementes, which are executed on the wicked, in the worlde to come; to witte, reiection from the kingdome of God, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to hell fire, where not onelie darkenesse amazeth the eies, and remembrance of sinne committed afflicteth the conscience, but an intolerable flame of fire tormenteth both soule and bodie for euer. These terrible iudgementes of GOD against sinne the Scriptures publish and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce to men in this life, that if the loue of heauen doe not winne them to obedience, the feare of hell shoulde hold them from resisting and contemning God. The greatest torment that in this life canne befall a sinner is desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when the soule of man, conuinced in her selfe by the number of her hainous ofsences, loseth all hope of life to come, and casteth her eies wholie on the fearefull tormentes of hell prepared for her; the continuall thought and fright whereof doe so amaze and afflict the comfortlesse soule, that shee sinking vnder the burden feeleth in her selfe the horrour of hell before shee come to it. So that the losse of heauen, and feare of hell maie torment wicked and desperate persons in this life; but the execution thereof,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:2155:130"/>
after this life, shall breede an other manner of astonishment and torment, then they canne yet conceaue. If the thought of these iudgementes and punishmentes, ordayned by Gods power and iustice for sinners, so afflict men, what shall the sight doe? If the feare of hell bee so intolerable, what shall the flame bee? when therefore you saie (Sir Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer) Christ suffered for vs <hi>the wrath of God</hi>; wee must not content our selues with that generall worde, you must tell vs in particular what partes and effectes of GODS wrath Christ endured, before you canne auouch that which hee suffered, to bee equall to hell and all the tormentes thereof. Did hee suffer hell fire either in soule, or in bodie? the damned shall suffer it in both. Did hee finde or feare himselfe to be excluded from the kingdome of God? the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned doe see themselues shut out for euer. If hee neither felt nor feared the <hi>MYST,</hi> the <hi>VVORME,</hi> the <hi>FIRE</hi> of hell, nor so much as <hi>DOVBTED</hi> the <hi>LOSSE</hi> of Gods kingdome, what tormentes equall to hell canne you name vs? [The wrath of God you will saie, is equall to hell and all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof]. The wrath of God is hell, and so are all the tormentes of hell; yea they are the sharpest effectes of Gods wrath against sinne. And therefore neuer plaie with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities and ambiguities, but expresse plainly what other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes of Gods wrath you meane. For since the <hi>losse</hi> of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the <hi>darkenesse, worme,</hi> and <hi>fire</hi> of hell, and the <hi>feare</hi> of both bee the greatest and sorest iudgementes of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne, that are <hi>decreed</hi> by his <hi>iustice, reuealed</hi> by his <hi>word,</hi> and <hi>executed</hi> by his <hi>power,</hi> in this life or the nexte: wee plainelie and truelie saie you can name vs none other effectes of Gods wrath equall to these.
If then it be hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous impietie to saie, Christ suffered these, and none other are equall to these, take backe your lauishing vntruth, that Christ suffered the effects of Gods wrath, <q>
                  <hi>equal to hel and all the tormentes thereof</hi>; </q>for my part I see neither sense nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in it.</p>

As you haue begonne so you will goe on; talking is your profession, you did your selfe wrong when you came to writing. This Antecedent as you vtter it, (your meaning is secret to your selfe) doth neither good nor hurt to the Question. That christ suffered in his whole manhood for the Redemption of our Sinnes is a thing by mee neuer doubted, nor denied; the doubt is, what he suffered in his whole manhood; and what in ech part of his manhood; for that he suffered all that he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his <hi>whole</hi> manhood your selfe doe disclaime in the next page, when you saie, <note n="p" place="margin">

               <q>This greeuous Passion was in his soule properlie and immediatlie, seeing then his bodie was not touched with anie smart.</q>
And when I gaue sixe causes that might bee of Christs agonie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> garden, did I so much as pretend that anie of them then touched his bodie, when he was affected with this passion of mind? And except this be your meaning, that Christ suffered some things for our Redemption in his whole manhood, and some things properlie and immediatlie in his Soule, your Antecedent hath a flatte contradiction in it selfe. For if he suffered <hi>all,</hi> that he suffered, in his <hi>whole</hi> manhood, how could hée suffer anie thing properlie and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2155:131"/>
immediatelie in his soule? which is the second part of your owne Antecedent. And if that bee the drift of your generall reason, about which you spende 32. leaues, you maie sit downe and begin againe a newe pamphlet, that shall haue some more certaintie then this hath. For heere you roue, neither expressing, nor indéede knowing what you woulde haue; onlie you hide your selfe in this generall phrase, that Christ <hi>suffered the wrath of God for sinne</hi>; but vnlesse you speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie" what he suffered, I do not meane to brabble with you, or with anie other, about generall and vncertaine speaches.

by his rising he swallowed vp our death; by his intercession wee receaue all the giftes and graces of God, which wee haue or shall haue; by his sitting in heauen with our flesh, he giueth vs assurance that our mortall bodies shall bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, like to his glorious bodie; yea the verie vnion of our nature to his is an effectuall meane to make vs one with him, as he is one with God.

<hi>How prooue you your first proposition,</hi>
               <q> In which part <hi>Adam</hi> did first Sinne, by that part Christ must satisfy for sinne?</q>
Satisfaction for Sinne the Scripture acknowledgeth none but by death; because y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Iudge in prohibiting <hi>Adam</hi> to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse threatned death:<note n="y" place="margin">

                  </hi> 9.</note> 
               <hi>Christ is the mediator of the new testament, that THROVGH DEATH, which was for the REDEMPTION of the transgressions in the former Testament, they which were called might receiue the promise of eternall inheritance.</hi> If nothing might satisfie for sinne but death; then consequently the Soule of Christ which could not die, could not paie the satisfaction for our Sinnes, howsoeuer Adam did, and we still doe sinne, most properlie with our Soules. This is but a straw in your waie; for you stiflie, but absurdly, if not impiously defend, that Christ died the death of the Soule;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide page</hi> 79.</note> yet because the Scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with one consent auouch the contrarie, yea S. Austen is so peremptorie therein that he asketh, <hi>QVIS AVDEAT DICERE, VVHO DARE AFFIRME IT?</hi> you shall giue mee leaue to tell you that the Apostle denieth your <hi>Maior,</hi> till you can make it good, not by your own vnlearned frensie, but by good testimonie of Scripture, that Christ did die the death of the Soule.
Now by your assumption, that Adam <q>
                  <hi>most proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie committed sinne in his soule</hi>; </q>If you mean that Adams soule was the agent, his body the Instrument which the soule vsed as in all sins, so in this; that indéed is most true, but directly repugnant to your conclusion.
Put that for your <hi>Minor,</hi> that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:2155:134"/>
               <hi>Adams soule transgressed the commaundement with hir bodie and by hir bodie</hi>; the conclusion then followeth in spite of your hart; <hi>ergo</hi> in satisfying for sinne the Soule of Christ must be punished with hir bodie &amp; by hir bodie; which is the thing you labour to ouerthrowe with all the wits you haue. Meane you otherwise that <hi>Adam</hi> brake the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, not by his bodie properlie, but by his soule? Then is your assumption a manifest contradiction to the fact of <hi>Adam.</hi> For with his eares he heard the perswasion of the woman, with his eies he liked the forbidden fruit, with his hand he tooke it, with his mouth he did eat it, which was the fact that God preciselie did prohibit. God did not saie to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> thou shalt not <hi>like</hi> it, or <hi>desire</hi> it, which the soule of <hi>Adam</hi> did, but <hi>THOV SHALT NOT EATE THEREOF,</hi> which could not bee performed but by the hand and mouth of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> and therefore <hi>Adam</hi> transgressed the commandement not by his soule, but by his bodie, euen as in murder, theft, &amp; adulterie, these facts men commit by their bodies and not by their soules.</p>
            <p>[But in that and all other sinnes brought to effect, the soule, you will saie, is the principall agent, the bodie is but the Instrument.] I grant it willinglie; and thence I conclude, <hi>ergo</hi> in the satisfaction for sinne, the soule must be the principall patient and dolent, and the bodie by Gods iustice must be the instrument of her paine. And here marke I praie thée (Christian Reader) whether this one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument doe not vtterlie ouerthrow all that this idle discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser hath doone, and would doe in this whole pamphlet. For nothing is more proportionable to Gods iustice, then to ioine them in paine, that were ioyned in sinne; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the same order in punishing, which they kept in offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. But all prouocations and pleasures of sinnes the soule <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aketh from her bodie, all acts of sinne she committeth by her bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e: therefore the iustice of God both temporallie and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:2155:134"/>
eternallie punisheth the soule by the bodie; that as it hath beene the Instrument of her pleasure, so it shall bee of her paine.
And if GOD obserue this course as well in his temporall as eternall vengeance on the sinnes of men, whie then shoulde not the sufferinges of Christes soule by his bodie bee truelie and properlie a satisfaction for sinne, which this great Doctor a little before said,<q>

                  <hi>the Scripture speaking heere after the common vse, and custome of redeeming cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues taken in warre doth meane that Christ paid for vs THE SAME PRICE which else wee should haue paid.</hi>
               </q> First whoe told you that the Scripture speaketh here after the common vse of Enimies, since in our Saluation the sonne of God interposed himselfe as a mediator with his father, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere what the iustice of God would require at the hands of his sonne, for the pardoning of a seruant, that had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?
You and your friends cannot abide to heare, that the enimie who had vs in captiuitie should haue any price for our deliuerance; you condemne that as a Manicheisme;
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2155:138"/>
and doe you nowe for an aduantage vrge that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie must haue a price for his captiue? Secondlie the price that wee shoulde haue paide was eternall condemnation of bodie and soule into hell fire. If Christ paide the same, looke wel least with séeking helpe from an enemie, you light not on open blasphemie. Lastlie to ioyne with you in your owne similitude, is it not the common vse in warres to redeeme captiuitie with monie? The Captiue himselfe is tyed to perpetuall imprisonment or seruitude; hee that will ransome a prisoner is not bounde to bee a Prisoner himselfe, but to yéelde such recompence in money or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, as the conquerour shall demaunde. So that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by your owne comparison, it is euident, the sonne of GOD in redeeming vs was not tied to our captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but might yeelde his Father a greater recompence for our absolution, then our condemnation woulde haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted vnto.</p>

If you aske to learne, you may bee soone taught. If you aske to brag, you maie be soone cooled. The curse of God vpon the sinne of man proceedeth from the wrath of God against the sinne of man; howbeit God curseth not onelie sinners, but other his creatures, with whom he is not angrie, but only because they shoulde not serue the pride and lustes of the wicked.

Gods euerlasting curse which is most due to sinne, I hope you will free him from. Gods spirituall curse, by which he depriueth the wicked of his <hi>trueth,</hi> of his <hi>grace</hi> and other <hi>giftes</hi> of his spirite, you must likewise cleare the sonne of GOD from. Hee cannot be subiected to that parte of Gods curse without apparant impietie. Take from him trueth, you make him a lyar; take from him grace you charge him with a reprobate minde; take from him the Spirit of GOD, you giue place to Satan to worke in him as in the children of vnbeliefe. I trust (Sir Refuter) you bee neither so wicked as to thinke, neither so desperate as to defend, that the sonne of God might suffer any of these curses.

But that I thinke (Sir Refuter,) you sinne of ignorance, not meaning to maintaine these blasphemies, and yet including them within the largenesse of your words, through the weaknesse of your wit, I must by the duty which I owe to God, and his truth, haue giuen you other termes, then now I do; but I had rather fatherly warne you to take

<q>[<hi>How standeth the Apostles reason then that Christ was made a curse?</hi>] </q>where in sinne there are two thinges, the committing of it, and the reuenging of it by God or man in this life or the next;

And so concludeth that Christ
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:2155:144"/>
receauing a <hi>Iudiciall,</hi> and <hi>corporall</hi> punishment of death for our sinne, not onlie therein <hi>suffered</hi> the curse, but <hi>satisfied</hi> the force of the law, &amp; by that curse of his suffering redéemed vs from the curse of our transgressing. The place cited out of <hi>Moses</hi> is this; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deuter.</hi> 21</note> 
               <hi>if a man haue committed an offence worthy of death, and is</hi> (by the lawe) <hi>to die, and thou hang him on a tree: his body shall not remaine all night on the tree, but thou shalt bury him the same day; for the curse of God is</hi> (alreadie laid or executed) <hi>on him that is hanged.</hi> This most apparantly was a <hi>publike</hi> punishment <hi>executed</hi> by the <hi>magistrate</hi> vpon the <hi>body</hi> of the offender; and because by his open and shamefull death, which <hi>Moses</hi> rightlie calleth <hi>the curse of God,</hi> hee had <hi>satisfied</hi> the sentence of the Iudiciall lawe, God commandeth no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reproch to be offered his bodie, in suffering it to hang in all mens eies any longer, but to bee buried the same daie; For that <hi>by</hi> his <hi>death</hi> the <hi>curse</hi> of God <hi>ceased.</hi> The difference betwéene these two curses is soone perceiued. Euerie sinne receaued the first curse, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> spake before; fewe crimes receaued the iudgement of this seconde kinde of curse which was to bee hanged. The first was inflicted by God himselfe: the second was executed by the magistrate. The first touched bodie and soule, in this life and the next; the second ended with the death of the bodie. The first was committing of sinne, the seconde was suffering for sinne. And therefore <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> exposition is verie true, when hee saieth; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chrysost. in ca.</hi> 3. <hi>ad Galat.</hi>

               <hi>The people were obnoxious to another curse,</hi> which was this; <hi>Cursed is euerie one, that continueth not in that which is written in the booke of the lawe, for there was not one of them that had fulfilled the whole Lawe; but Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steede of that, tooke vpon him another curse, which said, cursed is euery one that hangeth on the tree. He that should take away the first curse, must not bee subiect to the same, but vndertake an other in place thereof, and by that dissolue the first. As if one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adiudged to die</hi> (for some crime) <hi>an other, no way guilty of the same, but willing to die for him, should deliuer him from the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2155:144"/>
punishment: So did Christ; not being subiect to the curse of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, insteede thereof he tooke an other curse, and dissolued the curse that laie on them.</hi>

               <q>[Before a man can be accursed by his death, hee must, you saie, be iustlie hanged; for manie <hi>Innocents and martyrs are hanged who are most blessed.</hi>] </q>Innocentes and martyrs, bee their soules neuer so blessed, maie beare in their bodies a shamefull death, as Christ did in his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that is a kinde of corporall curse, though by men vniustlie inflicted, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as death in the godlie is a remnant of Gods curse vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sinne, though their soules bee blessed before and after death.
Yea the worde <hi>KALAL</hi> whence the Hebrewes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue that which with them signifieth a curse, noteth also to <hi>make vilde and contemptible,</hi> as if shame, reproch, and contempt were the greatest outwarde curse, that coulde befall anie man in this life. The cause why wee suffer it, shall make it iust or vniust; but wee must call thinges by those names, which GOD first allotted them. Nowe death, shame, wrong, reproch, and such like, God orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at first to bee punishmentes of sinne, and so partes of the curse due to sinne. If wee suffer at mens handes for piety, that which God appointed to be the wages of iniquity, so wee bee patient and willing to abide the triall, which is righteous with God, though iniurious from men, the name is not altered, but the reward increased. Yea God it is, that causeth iudgement to beginne at his own house oftentimes, by the handes of persecutors; hee doth vs right, when men doe vs wrong; and dealeth not with vs according to our sinnes in the greatest wrongs that can be done vs. Therfore martyrs and innocents may do well to remember, that God hath cause enough, though man haue none; and so submit themselues as worthie of worse from Gods handes. But none of these thinges may be saide of our Sauiour, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone among all the children of men wanted sinne, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered wrong; and therefore his punishments with God were

               <hi>iust, not</hi> by his <hi>deseruing,</hi> but by his <hi>desiring</hi> to suffer for man. How then commeth it to passe, that martyrs, which are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners before God, are vniustlie hanged, because they deserue no such thing at mens handes; and Christ who was most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent before men, and most righteous before God, you wil needs haue to be iustly hanged?</p>
            <p>
               <q>[<hi>The suerty</hi> (you say) <hi>by his suertiship is a debtor to the creditor and to the law</hi>; and so Christ, though most innocent in himself, yet was hee iustlie hanged, as our suretie, by the iust sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the law.]</q>
You mistake, Sir Confuter, as well the <hi>sentence of</hi> the lawe, as the <hi>suertiship</hi> of Christ. For though mans lawe permit, which is the rule of charitie, that men should beare each others burdens, and vndertake one for an other in money matters, and such like things which God lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in each mans will and power; yet tell me I praie, what lawe, Gods or mans, permitteth a murderer or like offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be spared, and an other, that is willing, to bee hanged in his steede? I thinke mans law will allow you no such su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertiship, I am sure Gods lawe will not. <note n="u" place="margin">

Remorse of sinne committed, vexing and gnawing the conscience, is the first of their paines, which suffereth them night nor daie to take anie test. Secondlie, the feare that God, whome they haue despised, hath likewise reiected them and is become their enemie, and therefore from him they looke for nothing, but the iust vengeance of their sinnes both in this life and the nexte, so pursueth them, that they tremble and slie when no man followeth them. Thirdlie the griefe to forsee themselues excluded from the fellowship of that ioie and blisse, which is prouided for the saintes of GOD, which <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saieth is far <hi>more bitter</hi> then the <hi>paine of hel,</hi> doth make them sinke for sorrowe. Lastlie the continuall terrour of that dreadfull iudgement which shall be pronounced, of that horrible confusion which then shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelme them; and of those eternall and intollerable flames of fire in which they shall burne; the verie terrour I saie and horrour thereof doeth so afflict and torment them, as if they presentlie felt it. More wordes may bee vsed, and perhaps more vehement to amplifie their paine; but these are the partes and causes of that feare and horrour, which pursueth the wicked for their haynous offences. Can anie of these, (Sir Refuter,) bee applied to Christ? Dare you but offer so much as the mention of the least of them to bee founde in the sonne of GOD? I thinke you bare not; I hope you will not.

Sir Refuter, if your vnderstanding and memorie be not lost, I tolde you that the humane nature of Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it selfe before the maiestie of God in iudgement, there to suffer man euerlastinglie to perish, whome hee deerelie loued, or to vndertake in his owne person that burthen, which the iustice of God, displeased with our sinnes, should laie vpon him. And if you doe not thinke this a cause sufficient for the manhoode of Christ to feare and tremble, yea for the time to bee astonished at the number of our sinnes, and terrour of Gods vengeance, prouided for our eternall destruction both of bodie and soule, you bee so déepe in your hellish paines, that your wits and senses are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. Absurdities and contrarieties are so rife with you, that you thinke other men can hardlie auoide them; but first vnderstand your owne, and then you shall the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter charge others.</p>

To shewe himselfe learned as well in the Gréeke tongue, as in philosophie, hee vndertaketh an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason that I made, and sporteth himselfe somewhat handsomlie with it. Out of the fift to the Hebrewes where the Apostle saieth, <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebre.</hi> 5</note> 
               <hi>Christ in the daies of his flesh did offer vp prayers and supplications with strong cryes and teares vnto him that was able to saue him from death, and was heard in that he feared,</hi> or deliuered from his feare; I collected two things. First that Christ in his praiers made in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> garden (for to those the Apostle pointeth) did but feare, and not as then suffer that he feared. The nexte, he was deliuered from his feare; and consequentlie neuer came to suffer that from which hee was deliuered. This Confuter replieth, as hee thinketh, verie soundlie, and verie sufficientlie. Thou shalt heare the whole. My reason hee maketh to bee this. <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 74.</note>
               <q>That wherein Christ was hearde and deliuered from by praier, he feared but felt not. But Christ was heard and deliuered by prayer from the wrath which he feared, therefore he felt it not. <hi>His answere is.</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Nay euen therefore he felt it. Wee deny therefore the first proposition. For hee was in some sense of it, when hee praied against it, and was
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:2155:158"/>
heard. He had then some foretast but the extremity came after, which hee before feared. And finallie hee being in all this was heard (as the verie word (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Againe very the fearing of Gods wrath is a true feeling, I saie not a ful feeling, but a true feeling: but it is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that now in this Agonie hee feared the wrath of God: Therefore hee truelie felt it. Therefore the Question is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</q>
You wrote this in the morning, Sir Refuter, when you were fresh and fasting, it is so short and sharpe; but be like it was darke, or your eies were dull you could not sée neither what I said, nor what your selfe saie.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide Pag.</hi> 29.</note> The force of my reason consisted in this, that where feare goeth before suffering, and is no longer called feare when suffering com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth; if Christ at the time of his praiers in the garden were deliuered from his feare, much more from anie suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of that hee feared. And since by your owne positions you affirme hee feared in his agonie the paines of hell; I concluded hee suffered them not. Let vs now sée howe you impugne this reason.

               <q>For fearing is a true feeling, and if Christ feared the wrath of God, <hi>ergo</hi> he felt it.</q>
You recken a pace when you recken alone, but when you come for allowance you will lacke a faire deale of your reckning. If fearing wore suffering, which is most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd; if there were no kind of feare, but your amazed and all confounded feare, as there be more other kinds of feares; if there were noe more parts of the wrath of God, but hell paines, as there be sundrie more; if no man might feare but for himselfe, as in charitie wee may, and in duty we ought to feare for others, and Christ in loue might and did for vs; then had you some hope, that he which granteth the one, would admit the other: but if this be all you can saie, that feare is a kind of feeling, I am as farre from granting the Question, as I was in the first beginning. For though you dallie with doubtfull words, and thinke it enough to catch here and there at a likelihood, my course is not so. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede out of these words I reasoned vppon your owne prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: and supposing it for the time to be true which on this place some auouch, that Christ feared the paines of hell, I concluded, if Christ were deliuered from fearing, he was certainlie deliuered from suffering the paines of hell. And before you answere the argument, you triumph as if the Question were granted. But Syr remember it
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:2155:160"/>
is the suffering of hell paines that we talke of, and not of a Metaphoricall kinde of féeling; which you substitute in stéed thereof. Againe all the effects of Gods wrath Christ did not feele, nor feare, as namelie, neither reprobation, nor desperation, nor eternall damnation, which is the chiefest and sharpest effect of Gods iust wrath against sinne. Some partes thereof if hee did feare, and so in affection feele, howe doth it followe hee felt or feared hell paines? Thirdlie, hee did sustaine as well our person, as our cause; hee had not onelie compassion on vs, but coniunction with vs; and in that respect as our head hee might worthilie feare the euerlasting destruction of his bodie, if he did not interpose himselfe, and auert Gods wrath from them, by healing them with his owne stripes, and bearing their sinnes in his owne bodie. Fourthlie he might feare the power of Gods wrath, able to punish euen the bodie of Christ with farre more smart, then his humane flesh was able to endure. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, hee might carefullie shunne and decline both our sinne and the wages of our sinne, which is eternall death with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious feare, as content to redeeme vs, but not to destroie both himselfe and vs.</p>
            <p>And this commeth néerest the signification of the Gréek worde there vsed, which is no confused or amazed feare, such as you woulde cunninglie conuey vnder the name of <hi>a</hi>

               <hi>perplexed feare,</hi> but a carefull and diligent regarde to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware and decline that, which wee mislike or doubt. And therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Christ was quickned by the spirit, when in his Passion he was put to death in his flesh. What meaneth it, that he was quickned by the spirit, but that the same flesh, in VVHICH ONLY HE DIED, rose againe by the quickning of the spirit? For that Iesus DIED IN SOVLE, I meane in his humane spirit, VVHO DARE AFFIRME IT, where as the death of the soule is nothing</hi> (in this life) <hi>but sinne, from which he was wholie free? Surelie the soule of Christ was not onlie immortal by nature, as others are, but neither died by sinne nor was punished by any damnation, which are the two waies
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:2155:170"/>
how the soule maie possiblie die. And therefore Christ could not bee said to bee quickned in soule by the spirite: for in that part was hee quickned, in which hee died. Therefore it was spoken (by Peter) of Christs flesh. That reuiued when the soule retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, because that died, when the soule departed. Christ then is sayd to bee done to death in his flesh, for that hee died ONLY IN HIS FLESH, and to be quickned by the spirite, because that verie flesh rose againe being quickned by the working of the spirite.</hi> These learned and sound conclusions of S. <hi>Austen,</hi> are derectlie repugnant to your weake and false obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Syr Refuter. <hi>Christ died in the flesh</hi> (saith <hi>Peter</hi>) that is saith <hi>Austen,</hi> in <hi>THE FLESH ONLY</hi>; for the soule of Christ died not, since the death of the soule is either <hi>sinne</hi> in this life, or <hi>damnation</hi> in the next, both which were farre from Christ. You tell vs that Christs soule not onlie died, but was also crucified; and all the proofe you bring for it, besides <hi>Terence,</hi> is that <hi>Peter</hi> saith Christ died in the flesh. Now the flesh saie you, signifieth as well the soule as the bodie, and so Christ died in both: but such proofes, if you vse them often, will prooue you to haue a great deale lesse religion and learning, then you would seeme to haue.</p>
            <p>What death the Scriptures affirme Christ died for vs, if you bee now to séeke at these yeares, it is pittie your shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders haue beene so long troubled with your head. Can there bee fuller, or plainer words then those which the foure Euangelists vse in describing the death, buriall, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the bodie of our Sauiour?

               </gap> these woordes for defence of your fancie, and to take the flesh for bodie and soule, that you maie make the death of Christe to bee common to both? [It is one thing, you will saie, to take the fleshe for the whole man, and another to take the bodie for the soule.] I knowe it right well, but the one will not serue your turne without the other. By a part to name or note the whole man, is no newes in the Scriptures; but to ascribe the attributes of one part to the other, because the name of either part is sometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the whole, that is a generall subuerting of all the trueth of the Scriptures. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> tolde you euen nowe, that Christes dead flesh is called Christ; will you therefore referre the properties of Christes dead flesh vnto his soule, and not thinke you take the waie to dissolue as well the vnion as communion of two natures in Christ,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:2155:173"/>
and of the distinction of two parts in his manhood? The body indeede is more distinguished from the soule, then the name of flesh is, because the vnregenerate part of the soule is in the Scriptures euerie where called flesh; but this hath no place in Christ, by reason no corruption of sinne cleaned vnto his soule, and therefore the name of fleshe doeth no where signifie the soule in Christ, as it doeth often in vs; onelie by naming flesh in Christ, the scripture sometimes intendeth, that he disdained not the weakest and basest part of our nature, when he came to redéeme vs. And so Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <note n="x" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>The worde was made flesh,</hi> meaning the true and eternall sonne of God, vouchsafed to take not onelie our reasonable and humane soule vnto him, but euen our vilde and mortall flesh into the vnitie of his person, and so became man, that hee might restore man nowe fallen from God, and perished in his sinnes, to the fauour and life of God againe. But when the Scriptures saie, that Christ died for our sinnes, the auncient fathers and Councels with one consent applie that to the death of Christes bodie on the Crosse, and not to the death of the soule, or to anie paines of hell. And though in the Treatise before I haue cited such as sufficientlie witnesse that doctrine to be sounde and Catholike, yet will I not bee greeued to let thee see (Christian Reader) that there was nothing more commonlie, nor constantlie professed in the Primitiue Church, then the doctrine which I am now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to defende against the rage and reproch of this slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous impugner.</p>

The doctrine there taught is sound, true and plaine, that we are redeemed by the death and bloud of Christ Iesus; that such was the iust displeasure of God against our sinnes, that though he were his owne son, that vndertooke the cause for vs, the iustice of God pursued him with most painfull smart and anguish e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto death; and forced the weaknesse of his humane flesh to crie, <hi>my God, my God why hast thou forsaken mee.</hi> But you content not your selfe with this; you must haue him suffer the verie paines of the damned in Hell, or nothing.

The iudges of these matters, in Saturnes time, and in the beginning of Iupiters raigne were the liuing of such as yet liued, and gaue iudgement the same daie that each man should die, wherefore their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was corrupt.

To whome Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter aunswered, I will see it redressed. The iudgementes are therefore now amisse, because they that are iudged are couered round, for they are iudged aliue, and so many that haue wicked soules are compassed with beauty, nobility, &amp; riches, and manie come to the place of iudgement, &amp; depose they liued honestlie, and so the iudges are astonished; as also the iudges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues are clogged, hauing their soules wrapped with their eies, and eares, and the rest of their bodie. First therfore men must be kept from foreseeing the time of their death. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they must be iudged whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are naked from all these thinges, that is after death, and the Iudge likewise must be deade also, that he may be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these lets, and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I foreseeing this before you, haue appointed Iudges, two of my sons Minos &amp; Rhada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthus out of Asia, and a third which is Aeacus out of Europe.

            <p>

                  </note> First, that he vtterlie misliked the opinion of the olde Latines, that thought the world of the dead was vnder the earth, and therefore gaue this terme <hi>INFERI,</hi> to signifie the same: this hee openly misliketh, that the damned soules were beneath in the earth, or at least in such kinde of torments as many did imagine. How much more did he condemne them, that thought all the deceased soules were beneath, vnder, or in the earth? The blessed hee thought rather, as Plato did, to ascend vp to heauen. <note n="s" place="margin">Pag. <hi>108.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Secondly, you note,</hi> That although hee reiected the opinion of the former Latines, yet hee retayned the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine phrase, as being now common and familiar euery where; which rose of olde from that opinion, thinking all the dead af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life to be <hi>infra,</hi> beneath. He had learned to thinke wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, but yet he spake so, as the vulgar phrase had preuailed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Aristotles rule; we must thinke as the wise doe, but speake as the people doe. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Tullie saith of this opinion followed great errors.</q>
If a man would hire you to speake against your selfe, you cannot doe it in playner manner than here you doe. You confesse that <hi>Cicero</hi> was the first (for before him you bring none) that misliked the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the olde Latines (whose seate and tongue in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> was then 1200. yeares olde) <hi>that the world of the dead was vnder the earth,</hi> and to signifie so much, they vsed the worde <hi>Inferi</hi>; which had continued in the mouthes of all men learned and vnlearned, till <hi>Ciceroes</hi> time, to expresse the state of the dead.
Secondly, you say the phrase was so <q>
                  <hi>common and familiar euery where for the worlde of the dead,</hi> that <hi>Cicero</hi> himselfe, though hee thought
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:2155:201"/>
otherwise durst not depart from <hi>the vulgare phrase which had so generally preuayled.</hi> 
               </q>Then by your owne confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wée haue thus much, that <hi>Inferi</hi> for twelue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares in the mouthes of all men ignorant, and learned among the <hi>Latines</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> did signifie the state of such soules as were vnder the earth.
Now let <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> say what he can to the contrarie; his authoritie is no waie so great that it should ouerwaigh so long and setled a consent. <hi>Great errors followed hereof Tullie saith.</hi> And you affirme the like, but not so great as <hi>Tullie</hi> himselfe mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in reiecting that opinion. For he in some pride of his tongue and conceite of his wit brought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heauen and hell to be vtterly nothing.</p>
            <p>That the old Latines thought all men after death to go vnder the earth I sée no proofe; I find rather the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie confessed by your owne author. He alleageth out of <hi>Ennius,</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">

               <hi>Romulus in caelo cum dijs agit aeuum, vt fama assentiens dixit Ennius. Romulus leadeth his life in heauen with the Gods, as Ennius approuing the fame writeth.</hi> And againe; <hi>Abijt ad Deos Hercules. Vetera iam ista, &amp; religione omnium consecrata. Hercules is gone to the Gods. These things are ancient and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the religious consent of all men.</hi> So that <hi>Ciceroes</hi> words which you alleage, cannot import that they thought so of all men, for then they must so haue thought of <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> which <hi>Cicero</hi> confesseth all men acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be in heauen; but they supposed so of most men; which amongst Pagans, as they were, was no such great error, as you would make it, nor any way so great as that which <hi>Cicero</hi> laboured to establish in place thereof. For he through the insolencie of his opinion of himselfe, or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie of his disposition, or both, would somtimes haue an <hi>Inferi,</hi> or hell below; and sometimes he would haue none. Examples whereof are euident in his writings. In his spleene against <hi>Antonie,</hi> he saith; <note n="u" place="margin">

               <hi>Ciceroes</hi> world of soules and his heauen into the Creede, and in respect of him disgraceth all other writers as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the latine tongue, these words will playnly shew thée, what an audacious, irreligious, and heathenish at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that is; and how absurdly and lewdly he saith, <hi>Cicero</hi> had learned to thinke wiselyer then they, that said hell was below in the earth. For they deliuered a trueth, and this of <hi>Ciceroes</hi> is a false, foolish and wicked fansie. The English of his words is in effect this. <hi>These things being certain, it ought to be a cleare case, that our soules when they leaue the bodie, whether they be of an aerie or fierie nature, do mooue vpward. A good helpe for the soule with more ease to passe and breake through this grosse ayre heere below is this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nothing is swifter than the soule. Which remayning vncorrupt, and alwaies like it selfe, OF NECESSITIE MVST ASCEND, and pearce, and deuide all THIS HEAVEN</hi> (or ayre) <hi>in which the cloudes, windes, and rayne engender. Which region when the soule hath once passed, and touched, and perceiued a nature like to it selfe, mixed of a subtile ayre, and the temperate heate of the sunne; in that fierie region, IT STAYETH, and maketh an ende OF AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CENDING ANY HIGHER. For when it hath gotten like both heate and purenes</hi> (of the ayre) <hi>balanced as it were with equall waights, it moueth no way. AND THIS IS THE NATVRAL SEATE OF THE SOVLE, when it commeth to a like ayre to it selfe; in which needing nothing, IT IS NOVRISHED and fed with THE SELFESAME THINGS, VVITH VVHICH THE STARRES ARE NOVRISHED and sustayned. Ciceroes</hi> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is nothing but an heap of heathenish impieties. The first, that the substance of the soule consisteth of <hi>fier</hi> or <hi>ayre</hi>; the second, that of necessitie it <hi>ascendeth vpward</hi> as fier doth. The third, that when it commeth to a pure ayre and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate heate of the sunne, it <hi>stayeth</hi> there, and ascendeth no higher. The fourth, that this is the <hi>naturall</hi> seat for the soule, and thence it moueth no way. The fift, that it is there nourished and sustayned <hi>with the selfe same things,</hi>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:2155:204"/>
with which the starres are. The consequents to this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen are most horrible. First that all soules by necessitie of their nature being in this place, there are consequently none in <hi>HELL,</hi> nor none in heauen, and so both those places are vtterly emptied by your eloquent Master. Next that, when the starres &amp; skies shall be melted and dissolued with fier, then must the soules of all men be likewise dissolued, consisting of the same matter, which they doe, and so vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguish. Lastly, Gods promises, and threats are all frustrate, if he can doe his enemies no more hurt, nor his seruants more good, then this heauen affoordeth. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you bring the world of soules, or this heauen into the Créede, I must refuse the Article for open and euident points of Infidelitie, which I suppose, the Apostles, nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicke men neuer meant, when they made the Créede.</p>

            <p>[It cannot be denied, you wil saie, but the olde testament referreth <hi>Sheôl,</hi> as the Septuagint doe <hi>Hades,</hi> both to the godlie and to the wicked after death.] It is most true that <hi>Sheôl</hi> in Hebrew, and <hi>Hades</hi> in Greeke are applied in the olde Testament both to the good and bad; The Question is not to what men, but to which parts of men, good or bad, <hi>Sheol</hi> and <hi>Hades</hi> are referred. To the bodies of men, good and bad, lying deade in the graue they are sometimes applied; to the soules of the godlie, as detained in either, they are neuer applied. <hi>Sheol</hi> and consequentlie <hi>HADES</hi> with the Septuagint, importeth the whole death that is due to sinne, and euerie part thereof; but by no meanes heauen, where the soules of the saintes are, nor anie part of that blisse, which they possesse. Since then as well the death of the bodie in this worlde, as the death of the soule in the next worlde were the wages of sinne; <hi>Sheol</hi> and <hi>Hades</hi>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:2155:207"/>
doe sometimes signifie the generall state of deade bodies, as when the Scripture describeth <hi>rottennesse, silence, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnesse, senselessenesse, contempt, dishonour,</hi> and such like to bee in <hi>Sheol.</hi> And the same worde when it is referred to the soules of the wicked as there detained, or of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as thence deliuered; for so much as the soule cannot be inclosed in the graue; of necessitie the pit prepared for the soules of sinners must bee, by all such textes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, intended. But that <hi>Sheol</hi> or <hi>Hades</hi> shoulde sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the worlde of Soules, as well in heauen as in Hell, neither hath this Refuter brought anie Texte or reason for it, neither will hee euer bee able to prooue it. And howsoeuer one of late hath taken vppon him to talke of those thinges, like one of the <hi>Titanes</hi> with bigge and bombasted tearmes; I, seeing nothing in that fardell of his but Riddles and raylinges, meane not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my course.</p>
            <p>Then touching the sense of <hi>Sheol</hi> in the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I take it to bee cleare, that it sometimes signifieth the graue or the state of deade bodies; but neuer the world of soules, which phrase the Refuter hath caught by the ende, hoping at length to conueie it into the Creede. But hee must first shewe vs where hee findeth anie such thing in the Scriptures, before wee maie suffer him to make it an Article of our faith. Against it euerie place is a proofe; but for it none that I reade, or they haue yet alleaged. They shifte handes, and in steede of the worlde of soules they bring in the graue, or the state of deade bodies; which is but a vaine flourish, to propose one thing, and to prooue an other.
And though you (Sir Refuter) goe to varying of phrases which I thinke is your best skill; as, <q>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 97.</note> 
                  <hi>The state of the deade, the worlde of the deade, the worlde of soules departed</hi>;</q> yet I must let you vnderstande there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these speeches.
<hi>Sheol</hi> may extend to their bodies whose soules doe liue in heauen: to their soules it cannot; and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:2155:207"/>
therefore you must not chop in the one for the other, as your <hi>instructor</hi> doth, who when he would proue the world of soules, falleth vp aboue head and eares into the graue. The one you shall euerie where light on, of the other there is no mention. As when <hi>Iacob</hi> said to his sonnes, <note n="l" place="margin">
                  <hi>Genes.</hi> 42.</note> 
               <hi>you will make my hoare haires descend to Sheol with sorrow</hi>; and likewise when <hi>Dauid</hi> said to <hi>Salomon,</hi>

               <hi>thou shalt make (Shemeis) hoare haires de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scende to Sheol with bloud</hi>: are there <hi>white haires</hi> or <hi>bloud</hi> in the worlde of soules, as there are in the graue? this is the state of deade bodies, but not of soules departed. In the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Core, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiran,</hi> the Scripture saieth; <note n="n" place="margin">

                  <hi>Vide pag.</hi> 147.</note> where <hi>Sheol</hi> is named, that cannot bee reffered to the graue, I haue in the treatise before specified and handled such of them, as I thought sufficient, especiallie receauing no answere to my reasons, but the <hi>Sphingicall</hi> perplexities of an high minded Maister; whose wordes with mee, though they bee of the largest size, are but winde. And therefore I rest vpon the same groundes and proofes, which I make before, and stande to iustifie, that in no place of the olde or newe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, where <hi>SHEOL</hi> or <hi>HADES</hi> are named, their world of soules is, or canne bee vnderstoode; let them name mee the places, I will presentlie send them by Gods grace an answere.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>HADES</hi> (good Reader) by which worde the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint expresse the Hebrue <hi>SHEOL</hi>; in all these textes, where thou seest the worde <hi>SHEOL,</hi> thou maiest assure thy selfe the Septuagint vse <hi>HADES</hi> in stéede thereof, and the verie same reasons that serue for <hi>Sheol,</hi> serue for <hi>HADES</hi> in
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:2155:209"/>
euerie point without exception: And that maketh me who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to skippe the handling of <hi>HADES</hi> in the Septuagint; and to referre the discussing thereof till I come to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the newe Testament. Now the consequent of that I haue alleaged either heere or before, is this; that by <hi>SHEOL</hi> and <hi>HADES</hi> in the olde Testament must néedes be meante either <hi>HELL,</hi> the <hi>GRAVE,</hi> or their <hi>VVORLDE OF SOVLES,</hi> which they so much talke of; if no place in the olde Testament doe necessarilie enforce their worlde of soules to bee vnderstoode by either of these wordes, then it remaineth, that in what textes the graue maie not bee endured to bee the meaning of either of these wordes, there wee conceaue the place of the damned must bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in either of them. Peruse both the obseruations and allegations before,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide pag.</hi> 147</note> and thou shalt see both the textes and the proofes, whie the place of the damned must often bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode by <hi>Sheôl</hi> in the bookes of the law and the prophets. I hope thou wilt thinke it supersfluous for mee to defende it, or enlarge it, before anie man doe particularlie impugne it. So that whatsoeuer you prate (Sir Refuter) without waight or warrant touching <hi>Sheol,</hi> I count it lip labor; when you or your helpers bring anie thing worth the regarding, you shal find me readie to receaue it, or refute it; as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deserueth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sheol</hi> then in the olde Testament, and <hi>Hades</hi> in the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint signifiyng somtimes the state of deade bodies which is the graue; sometimes the place of deade soules, which is hell; but neuer the world of soules, whereof some are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; let vs see what force <hi>HADES</hi> hath in the new testament; or whether it can thence be proued, that <hi>HADES</hi> importeth the world of soules. As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mysteries of God were more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the gospel, then by the law; so the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen was more preciselie seuered from the kingdome of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan by Christ, then by <hi>Moses.</hi> What <hi>Moses</hi> darkelie sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed vnder figures, that Christ reuealed in plaine wordes;
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:2155:209"/>
and therefore hell fire, which is obscurelie mentioned in the law and prophets, is often and openlie named by the mouth of our Sauiour; and <hi>HADES,</hi> which before extended to good and bad, is nowe by the writers of the newe testament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to the place of the damned. So that <hi>Hades</hi> with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> signifieth hell, and the powers thereof, and not the death of the bodie, much lesse the world of soules. Examples hereof I haue giuen thée (gentle Reader) in the <note n="u" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide pag.</hi> 171</note> Treatise before; saue that I then reasoned the death of the bodie was not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by <hi>HADES,</hi> which now those deuisers haue changed into the <hi>VVORLD OF SOVLES.</hi> I must therefore nowe ouerrun all those places againe, and shewe that the <hi>VVORLD OF SOVLES</hi> cannot bee expressed by anie of those places.

               <hi>ô death where is thy sting? ô HADES where is thy victorie?</hi> what reason is there to exclude out of these words, Christs victorie ouer <hi>HELL,</hi> since the same Apostle witnesseth, that Christ had a glorious triumph against hell, and the word <hi>HADES</hi> in all the places of the new Testament, which we haue yet view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inferreth hell? [The Apostle (you saie) <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 117.</note> 
               <hi>speaketh not of the Damnation of the wicked; but of the resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the dead.</hi>] And so do I; and therefore inferre, that when the bodies of the saints shall be raised from death, whose soules be already saued from hell; then shall these words be openlie verified, ô <hi>death where is thy sting? ô hell where is thy victorie</hi>? For since by sinne hell gate possession of both parts of man as well of his bodie as of his soule; the full deliuerance of man must free both parts, and the full conquest ouer hell is the losse of both parts, which in the resurrection of the dead shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and not afore; and therefore then is the time for all the faithfull to thanke God, for their full victorie ouer <hi>DEATH AND HELL,</hi> and to saie with the Apostle <hi>ô death where is thy sting? ô HELL where is thy victorie</hi>? But what hath <hi>your world of soules</hi> to do with these words, or with anie other; where <hi>HADES</hi> is named in the new testament? All these places serue fitlie for hell, and the most of them neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarilie; since either is expressed as a diuerse thing from <hi>HADES,</hi> or not to bee comprised in the name of <hi>HADES.</hi>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:2155:212"/>
But your <hi>world of soules</hi> is most absurd and false in euery one of these, and can not stand with the circumstance of the text, the first of the <hi>Reuelation</hi> onelie excepted, where though there be no wordes to impugne it, yet are there none to approue it. For is it anie curse for <hi>Capernaum,</hi> to bee brought to the worlde of soules, except you meane hell? Doth your world of soules <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne</hi> the Church of Christ? or destroy the fourth part of the earth? or shall it be cast into the lake of fire? And what <hi>victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> shal the iust haue against the world of soules in the last day; since their owne soules reioice to receiue their bodies; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the soules of the wicked they neither may nor will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult? It therefore remaineth that though <hi>HADES</hi> with the Septuagint signifie either <hi>BODILIE DEATH</hi> or <hi>HELL</hi>; yet in the new Testament where <hi>HADES</hi> is described as a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing from <hi>DEATH,</hi> and following <hi>AFTER DEATH, HADES</hi> of necessitie, being <hi>NOT DEATH,</hi> must needes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>HELL.</hi> Of the place in question, <hi>Thou wilt not leaue my soule in HADES,</hi> I will yet saie nothing, but will come to the words of the Creede, <hi>Christ descended to HADES,</hi> and search what must be the meaning of <hi>HADES</hi> in that article.</p>
            <p>What I take to be the meaning of <hi>Hades</hi> in the Creede, where it is said, <hi>Christ descended to HADES,</hi> as also what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons lead me thereunto, thou hast, Christan Reader, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide Pa.</hi> 171.</note> treatise, thou shalt with more ease finde it there, then I repeat it here; howe much this Confuter confesseth or resisteth, that must I now examine. When I obiect that in a short sum of the Christian faith made for the simple and common people, to repeate one thing twice were néedlesse, and against the nature of the Creede: and to vse a darke and hard phrase after a plaine and easie, is vnreasonable and absurde; he answereth, <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 126.</note>
               <q>It is true. I hold it vnreasonable altogither in the short and vulgar Creed, appointed euen for the common Christians, to vse words darke and difficult. And when the same thing is by diuers words expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the later ought to be the lighter and cleerer. Therefore I fullie grant, in the Creede speciallie, the phrase must be familiar, triuiall, easie and plaine.</q>
               <hi>I vrged thrée things to be obserued in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:2155:213"/>
the Creede, the words to be proper and euident with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out figuratiue obscuritie, the things to be different without idle repetition, and the order to be consequent without anie confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
The Confuter agreeth with me in all these; and he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not but his exposition is such. Since then there be three expositions of that article, Christ descended to <hi>HADES</hi>; that is either to the <hi>GRAVE,</hi> or to <hi>HELL,</hi> or to the <hi>VVORLDE OF SOVLES,</hi> which in Christes case (you saie) was <hi>HEAVEN</hi>; which of these thrée, Sir Refuter, commeth neerest to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a short, easie, and orderlie summe of a Creede? The first you like not, because it expresseth that in darke and hard cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumloquution, which was familiarly and plainely said before, <hi>he was dead and buried.</hi>
The question then resteth betweene the two last, which of the twaine best expresseth the proper sense,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag. 125.</hi>
               </note> and vulgar vse of the worde <hi>HADES.</hi>

               </q>
If it bee so, then your expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, (Sir Refuter) is cleane thrust out of doores. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the auncient Maisters of the Gréeke tongue, which were the Poets, nor with the Septuagint, nor with the writers of the newe Testament, nor with the people of that time, in their vnderstanding, did <hi>HADES</hi> euer signifie the worlde of soules without anie limitation of state, or place. Againe that generall and indefinite worlde of soules, without respect of hell or heauen, is no point nor part of the Christian faith. For faith touching Christ must not be generall or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, but particular and certaine. It is no faith, much lesse an article of the faith, to saie, Christes soule after death went <hi>some whither</hi>; the Creede muste specifie the place whither it went before it can bee a matter of faith, that must bee beleeued. And therefore <hi>HADES</hi> doeth point out the particular place, as hell or heauen whither Christes soule went after death, before any man may chalenge it to be the true meaning of that article.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If anie doe aske particularlie whither is this? You aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi>

This in déede is a <hi>familiar, triuiall, easie,</hi> and <hi>plaine</hi> exposition, Christs soule <hi>DESCENDED DOVVNE TO HADES</hi>; that is, it <hi>ASCENDED VP TO HEAVEN.</hi> And so by taking <hi>heauen</hi> for <hi>hell,</hi> and <hi>ascending vppe</hi> for <hi>descending downe,</hi> you haue quickelie made an ende of this matter. Whie then goe on with your wise Maister, and make <hi>HADES,</hi> which is the chiefe <hi>Diuell,</hi> to bee <hi>God,</hi> and you haue made a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect exposition of the Creede, fitte for such as attribute to Diuels, what they shoulde attribute vnto GOD.

But, Sir, wise men that regarde their faith more then your follyes will aske; where you finde descending for ascending, and <hi>Hades</hi> for heauen?

You like a tyrant ouer the Scriptures, will haue what sense pleaseth you in euerie place; and then you saie it is plaine and common. In déede your ignorance and insolencie is verie plaine and common; but the interpretations which you make of Scripture, be absurde and more then foolish. A man liuing maie well be said to descend into his graue; liuing hee standeth, dying he lieth downe; and the face of the earth on which we are, is higher then the bowels of the earth where wee lie buried; but of a soule ascending vp to heauen, to say it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth to hell, is a phrase of your making, and fit for your faith; which is guided more by will then by truth.

Is this all you haue to saie (Sir Refuter,) then when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uender is deuided you shall haue a part for your good collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. You collect that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> later Synode by leauing out certain words of the former <hi>renounceth</hi> that <hi>CHRIST AFTER DEATH VVENT TO HELL</hi>; and that which it retaineth of the former Synode in expresse wordes is this; <hi>IT I TO BE BELEE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VED THAT CHRIST VVENT DOVVN INTO HELL.</hi> So in your iudgement by <hi>beleeuing that Christ wente downe into Hell, they renounce, that Christ went to hell.</hi> If it were a matter of sight I shoulde aske whether you had anie eies or no; nowe it is a matter of reason I must more doubte whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you haue your fiue wittes or no. Set your inference to the viewe of all men. The Synode in her Maiesties time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth, <hi>It is to be beleeued that Christ vvent downe into hell. Ergo they appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly renounce that Christ went to hel.</hi> This is your conclusion; shew it to any tapster or tinker in Englande and sée whether he will reward you with a mocke or no.</p>
            <p>[But they leaue out the latter part of the Article which the former Synode concluded.] So they leaue out <hi>that Christs bodie vvas in his graue vntill his resurrection,</hi> which are the wordes of the former Synode. Is the omitting of this a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest renouncing and abrogating of it? God forbid [But the first Synode in king Edwardes time added farther, you saie, <hi>that Christs spirit vvas vvith the spirits detained in Prison or in

But I wish him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and so I leaue him. Secondlie, (Sir Refuter) you maie see three thinges in the latter wordes of that Article in king Edwardes Synode, which are verie wiselie with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ouerskipped by the Synode in her Maiesties time; and wherein for my part I thinke they did verie well not to adde to this Article, anie time, purpose, or prisoners, when, why, or to whome Christ descended. But therein to imitate the wisedome of the best ages, who kept this Article as they founde it without enterlacing it with anie newe additions. For in the later wordes of that former Synode nowe left out are three thinges that cannot bee iustified by the Scriptures. 1. that the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the <hi>iust vvere in hell.</hi> 2. that <hi>Christ there preached</hi> vnto them. 3. that he <hi>staied</hi> there <hi>till</hi> his <hi>resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> These three pointes contained in the Article of that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node; were aduisedlie and profitablie suppressed by the Synode kept in her maiesties time; and these are the pointes which I my selfe impugne in this Treatise, as hauing no iust nor tolerable grounde in the Scriptures. But these thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drowned by omission, what is that to the rest of the article, which the later Synode imbraceth as a matter necessarie to be beleeued? for thus they resolue;<note place="margin">

But the same Bishops &amp; the same Clergie that were at the first Synode in the 5 of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, assembling again in the 13 yeare of her highnes raign, did themselues english it as I report it, and offered it to the Prince &amp; Parliament in those words to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that high Court did.
