         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Weapons that Gods Ministers should use in their Warfare,
was wont to be praiers and teares onely; all the persecuted and
Martyr'd Protestants that suffered in the bloody Raigne of
Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> had no other Armes to oppose Authority; noe
Imprisonment, Banishment, losse of goods, Fathers, Mothers,
Wives, Sons, Daughters, kindred or friends, could shake their loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty;
no Racks Tortures, or Tyrannicall Torments, nor Death
in most cruell waies of flame, fire and faggot, could alter the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
of Protestants in those times, so that there was not any one
of them did attempt at any time to raise divisions to disturbe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Queene or State; therefore if we be of the same ancient
Religion which they then profest, and hath bin since maintained
these 84 yeares in this Kingdom, then we have more reason then
they had to be obediently thankfull for it, because we do (or may)
enjoy the blessings and benefits of it in secure peace and tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which they could not.</p>
            <p>Love is the Livery which the servants of our Saviour doth
weare, for he saith, <hi>By this shall all men know that you are my Disciples
if yee have love one to another,</hi> Joh. 13. 35. Now love and peace
have no communion or fellowship with War, especially in one and
the same Kingdom, betwixt one and the same Nation, pretending
to professe one and the same Religion: nor do these men shew
themselves to be Christs Ministers or Disciples that stir up divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt us, <hi>for every Kingdom divided against it selfe shall be brought
to nought, and every City or House divided against it selfe shall not stand:</hi>
Mathew 12. 25.</p>
            <p>In the Raigne of King <hi>Richard</hi> the first, (surnamed <hi>Cor de Lyon</hi>
or Lions heart) there was a Bishop in this Land that Rebelled against
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61532:3"/>
the King who was taken in a Battell and clap't in Prison, the
Newes of the Bishops imprisonment being carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> the
Pope (<hi>Benedict</hi> the 2) sent a Letter to the King for the Bishops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement,
wherein hee declared that the Bishop was a servant of
God, a Reverend Father, and likewise the Pope wrote that hee
was his Sonne: to which Letter the King returned an answer to
the Pope to this effect, May it please your Holynesse, If this be a
Habit or Coate for a Church-man, and one of your Sonnes, I
pray you Judge, for I tooke him fighting in this Coat of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate
Armour: The King thus sending and the Pope seeing the
Armour sent this replie, May it please your Majestie, such a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as this belongs to no Son of mine, and therefore as he is in
prison, there let him lie for me.</p>
            <p>It were well if every man and woman were at deadly Warre with
their transgressions, such a Warr would make our peace with God,
and the God of Peace would give us the blessing of his peace,
which passeth all understanding.</p>
            <p>How can peace be expected if we continue in our wickednesse
and wallow in Impieties, esteeming peace at that low rate as if it
were not worth the praying for, or the desiring for without any
command from Authority, some strange opinioned men have
thrust out of the Church that needfull prayer, <hi>Give peace in our time
O lord; Almighty and most Merifull Father,</hi> is omitted and neglected,
the Creede is left out, and unbeliefe and Infidellity hath intruded
too much into the roome of it and the Commandements are not
repeated, and in the place of all these is crep't in a confused Masse
of Toutalogicall Long-winded Repetitions, with the fearefull In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigations
and Incitements to provocations of Hostility and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Iohn Stow</hi> relates in his Chronicle, <hi>pag</hi> 697, that in the 25
yeare of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> blessed Raigne, Anno 1583. on the 4 and
6 of <hi>Iune,</hi> one <hi>Elias Thacker</hi> and one <hi>Iohn Copizg</hi> were hang'd at St
<hi>Edmondsbury</hi> in <hi>Suffolke</hi> for dispersing Libells and Pamplets against
the Booke of Common Prayer, which were written by one <hi>Iohn
Browne</hi> one of the first mad Apostles of the Sect of the <hi>Brownists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are no Protestants but will confesse, that that Queene (of
happy and famous memory) was a true defendresse of the Faith
professed by the Protestants, that she hazarded her life for it divers
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61532:4"/>
times, in the bloody raigne of her Sister and in the whole course
of her 44 yeares Raigne many Romish Treasons were plotted and
attempted against her only because she maintained that Booke,
which was then no Masse-booke (though now it be esteemed so)
and if any Popery had bin then perceived to be in it, that glorious
and godly Princesse would never have protected it, neither would
two great Protestant Kings (since her Reigne) have profest and
maintained it 40 yeares, yet I am of opinion that somethings may
be omitted in it some things reform'd some things dissolv'd, but the
most correspondent to Scriptures manners and good life, I hope shall
be ever upheld and maintained by all understanding Protestants.</p>
            <p>Thus the vaine scattering opinions of some selfewill'd, some ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
some Ambitious, some Presumptuous, and some maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Turbulent spiriits have drawne the Church and State several
wayes, that the poore Common-Wealth (which is the body of the
Kingdome) is almost pulld in twaine, as is Emblematically shewed
in the Picture of the two headed Serpent.</p>
            <p>There are too great a number that have gotten the wisdom of the
old serpent but there are few that are possest with the Innocency of
the <hi>Dove,</hi> the old Serpent is a malitious breaker of Peace and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Laborer for Warre, his onely businesse is to make us wicked
and he knowes that for the sinnes of a people God sends War for
a punishment, 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 8, 35 37. He knowes Warre doth plunge a
Nation into misery and that the breach of all Gods lawes is At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
upon Warre, and Inseparably joyne with it; Pride (like a
Gentleman Usher) goes before destruction odious swearing Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Prophanation, damnable disobedience, execrable murders,
shamelesse adulteries, Incests, Rapes, and deflorations, Lawlesse
Stealing and plundering and all the Crimes and Calamities that
may bring poor and miserable mankind to distruction are Incident
to Warre, and continuall waiters on <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Bellona.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet there is nothing more uncertaine then the events of Warre
nor is there any thing more unsure then the successe of a battell
for though it be never so prudently pondered by the most wise and
valiant counsell of the best and most expert Leaders, though the
plot be contrived by the best Iudgments of the most knowing
Commanders, as how to gaine the advantage of ground wind,
sun, how the Front, Van, Reare, Flanks, Wings, and body of an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61532:4"/>
Army shall or may prevaile and be victorious; yet all these serious
consultations have found most strange alterations, and as a man
that presumes to reckon without his Hoste is quite out and must
begin againe, for.
<q>
                  <l>They are most blind, with ignorance besotted,</l>
                  <l>VVho think Warrs councell in a Chamber plotted,</l>
                  <l>Must be so acted with the dint of sword,</l>
                  <l>As it was wisely talkd of at the board</l>
                  <l>Me thinks the Proverbe should not be forgot,</l>
                  <l>The Warrs are sweet, to those that knowes them not.</l>
               </q>
But if there were any sweet content in Warre, it may rather be,
so either in a forraigne Warre abroade against Turkes, Infidels,
Iesuiticall Papists, or any of Gods and our Nations Enemies such
Warrs as those may not onely be Tolerable, but Commendable,
Profitable, and Honourable; But for Englishmen, for <hi>Brittaines,</hi> for
Protestants, to Warre against Protestants, the Fathers against their
Sonnes, and the Sonnes against their Fathers, when one Brother
shall sheath his sword in the Bowells of another, when a King is
against his Subjects; and Subjects against their Soveraigne, this
kind of Warre is unpleasing to God, and a good King, unprofitable
distastfull to true and Loyall Subjects, and dishonourable to all.</p>
            <p>God forbid that <hi>Prerogative</hi> of Kings should be too much stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
or diminished any way, or that Priviledge should shrink to
enslave or pinch the liberty of free-borne Subjects: Our King
doth know that if he defend the Faith the Faith will save him:
and he further knowes that he must maintaine his Lawes, or else
his Lawes cannot defend him: The King knowes, that though
Kings are called Gods on earth yet they are but Gods of earth (or
earthen Gods) and loyall Subjects do obediently love and honour
the King. Good Kings may be compared to Lightning because as
Lightning doth never hurt Wooll or any soft unresistable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
but it violently penetrates, breakes and melts Trees Rocks,
and Mettalls, so a good King doth never proceed in wrath against
milde and gentle natures. I would we could thinke upon the great
mischiefes that the divisions betwixt <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> brought
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the massacres that long continued in <hi>Italy</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61532:5"/>
betweene the <hi>Guelphes</hi> and <hi>Gibelines,</hi> or the unnaturall dissension
that bloodily embrewd this Kingdom 80 and od yeares betwixt
the Royall Families of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and as Brothers in one
House do often jarre and disagree, yet if one of them be injured
by a stranger, the other will take his part, so let all <hi>English</hi>-men or
<hi>Britaines,</hi> King and Subjects, great or small (like Brothers) take it
to heart how they are all abused (by the common enemy) the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and God grant that the King may be defended
