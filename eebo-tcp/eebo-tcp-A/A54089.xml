            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Penitent Murderer, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>MR <hi>William Ivy</hi> (the unhappy Subject of this following Diſcourſe) was a Gentleman, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the Ancient Family of the <hi>Ivies</hi> in Wiltſhire, his Grandfather Sir <hi>George Ivy,</hi> his Uncle Sir <hi>Thomas Ivy</hi> of <hi>Masbury</hi> in the County of <hi>Wilts;</hi> and his Father though a younger Brother, yet endowed with a Fortune plentiful enough to afford him liberal Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; But his own promptneſs and readineſs to learn, and his induſtry to improve that Learning, made him ſo little chargeable to his Friends, that after having been but a while at School at <hi>Weymouth,</hi> he grew capable of himſelf, and attained to an Imployment for his own Maintenance, after which he became Clerk to Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> (one of the late Surveyor-Generals of his Majeſty's Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms) with whom he remained till the death of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Blake;</hi> alwayes behaving himſelf ſo, as to deſerve the reputation of Diligent and Virtuous.</p>
            <p>This had been encouragement enough to any indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Parent to take a particular care of, and have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar delight in a Child; and his Father made as fair a ſhow of it as any man could do, and ſeem'd induſtriouſly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93186:3"/>
to labour for his ſettlement, who had taken hitherto ſo good a care of himſelf; he therefore conſidering him now come to the 25th year of his age, determined to marry him, and in that his choice agreed with his Son's, pitching upon and encouraging him to the hopes of gaining Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Rowland,</hi> late of the Three-Cups-Inn in <hi>Breadſtreet,</hi> againſt either whoſe Perſon, Virtue, or Fortune no exceptions were to be made.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore no wonder if the young Gentleman had eaſily directed to her his whole thoughts and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; and 'tis natural to Youth, when once they love, to affect the purſuing their Amours with all the Vigour and Gallantry they can, and any croſs that lights in their way eaſily diſcontents them, and their eagerneſs turns into a kind of Frenzy; and the brain, thus diſtracted, is ready to admit any impreſſion to arrive at its end; and ſo Natures, that were before perfectly pure and good, become the eaſier vitiated, and are hurried on to ſtrange and prodigious Violencies.</p>
            <p>Thus this unfortunate young Gentleman, finding ſome Friends falling off from their promiſes made to him in relation to his Marriage with the fore-named Mris. <hi>Elizabeth Rowland,</hi> began to think himſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Honour to find ſome ways to proſecute it, and the ſtudying upon it drove him into Malancholly, and Malancholly increaſed his diſcontent, and then is the Devils time of working, who never omitts the playing upon ſuch Engins.</p>
            <p>In this height of diſcontent he comes to Sir <hi>Robert Longs</hi> (where he had long been acquainted) and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93186:3"/>
for him, finds all the Family out of Town, but only one Young-man called <hi>William Pew,</hi> and a Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant.</p>
            <p>This Young-Man and Maid having before received their inſtructions from a Gentlewoman, Houſe-keeper to Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> and Countrywoman to Mr. <hi>Ivy,</hi> treated him with all manner of Civility and Reſpect, and they drank a bottle of Wine together, after which the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Mr. <hi>Ivy</hi> ſpent ſome time in ſurveying the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of the Houſe, and viewing the Pictures, till hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into a Room where ſome Guns lay, he took down one and ſhot at a Mark, and then putting the Gun in its place returned to his former divertiſement of ſeeing the Houſe, when coming into Sir <hi>Robert Long's</hi> Bed-Chamber he pull'd a Piſtol out of his pocket and ſhot the young-man through the Back; who thereupon turning about, cryed out, <hi>Mr. Ivy, how could you have ſo much cruelty to ſerve me thus?</hi> upon which Mr. <hi>Ivy</hi> having a Cane in his hand ſtruck him over the Head; on which he fell down and never ſpoke more.</p>
            <p>But here may be obſerved with what cunning the Devil works, who could put into the invention of man the taking down a Gun and ſhuting at a Mark, that the noiſe of his Piſtol might not afterwards be ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>The Youngman thus made ſure of, he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not ſecure whilſt the Maid who was gone to dreſs him ſome Eggs might poſſibly come too ſoon to call him, &amp; therefore dragging the Youngman into the Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and there covering him with what he could find, he makes haſte to the Kitchin, with a full reſolution to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93186:4"/>
have murdered the Maid likewiſe, at which he made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proffers, but was ſtill prevented by that good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel which protected her; ſo that in a little time came in another Maid, and then his evil Angel draws him off from that to Sir <hi>Robert Longs</hi> Money-Cheſt, whence he took ſeven hundred-pound baggs, two of which he never carried out of the houſe, the other five he carried into the Garden, four of which he laid within the houſe of office door, the other he carried away with him into <hi>London,</hi> and there changed it into Gold; the ſame night he came for two more which he likewiſe carried away with him, and the other two he buried under the ſtairs of the Water-gate, which could not be found. The next day he changed the reſt of his money into Gold, and took a reſolution to take his leave of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though he had ſo reſolved in his mind, yet it was not in his power to act it; and all the while he was in <hi>Southwark,</hi> whither he went with intent to take Poſt for the Sea-ſide, he felt the load of Blood and the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany of his Crime giving him a check, and infuſing into him (as himſelf expreſſed it) theſe kind of thoughts; <hi>If I do get beyond Sea, and there live ſome time more in ſins, in the midſt of them all I may be ſerved my ſelf, as I my ſelf have ſerved the young-man;</hi> and theſe conſiderations drew him again back to his Lodging, at one Mr. <hi>Naſh</hi> a Strongwater-man's in <hi>Little-Eaſtcheap,</hi> where the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of Juſtice found and ſeized him, and brought him to (as himſelf with all deſirable penitence confeſſes) his juſt and deſerved puniſhment. His free confeſſion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93186:4"/>
of the whole matter of Fact, and his admirable Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it before the Bench, immediately pleading <hi>guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and yielding up himſelf with a reverent ſubmiſſion to that puniſhment he confeſſed he had ſo juſtly deſerved, leaves no room for any more to be ſaid concerning his Tryal.</p>
            <p>But here it is to be noted, that he had behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alwayes with ſo much Civility and Regularity, that his Landlord thinking it impoſſible he ſhould ever be guilty of ſo heinous a crime as that wherewith he was charged, was ready to offer himſelf to be his Bail.</p>
            <p>From all which it may be obſerved, that neither Birth, Wit, Education, Induſtry, nor a habit of well living, can, without the eſpecial Grace of God, free us from the ſnares of Satan; and therefore a much better uſe may be made of theſe fatal Accidents, then the common one of reviling and railing at the lapſes of our Brethren, by a due conſideration had of the neceſſity and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of thoſe two ſhort Petitions of that Prayer taught us by our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Lead us not into Temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.</hi>
