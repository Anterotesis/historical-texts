            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere are three chief faculties, Law, Physick, and Divinity; the one respects the estate, the other the body, the third the soul. Every Englishman should labour for a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of knowledg in all three; First of the Laws of the Land, that he may not (through the ignorance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) prejudice his estate; Secondly, of Physick, as the Proverb saith, <hi>Every man is a fool or a Physician;</hi> that is, either knows what is good or hurtfull for his own body, or else is not so wise as he should be; Thirdly, of Divinity; a man may be a bad Christian not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this knowledg; but he
<pb facs="tcp:65537:7"/>
cannot be a good Christian without it.</p>
            <p>The study of the Law is <hi>multorum annorum opus,</hi> and it must needs be the more difficult to attain unto perfection in it, since, though there be Inns of Court (Colledges as it were for Students in that Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) yet the Law it self is not so well methodized (as other Sciences) nor are there Tutors or publick Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the same, as of other Arts; but<note place="margin">Qui sibimet discipulus est, stultum habet pro magistro.</note> every Student is to acquire knowledg in it by his own industry: most of the Cases which he reads, are to be commited to memory.</p>
            <p>Of all that have written systema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically as it were by way of Institutes, <hi>Littleton</hi> is most extolled, he being the <note n="*" place="margin">Cooks pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the 10 Report, and Tookers case 2 Rep.

            <p>And I hope that this little Treatise being in English, and digested into an Alphabeticall order, will be usefull for young Students in the Law, Iustices of Peace, and other Countrey Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whose benefit I especially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in the publication of it. But least any should object (as perhaps some may) that I have nothing here but what is already in the <hi>Terms of Law,</hi> and <hi>Cowels Interpreter;</hi> I shall intreat the Iudicious, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare what I have of the word Acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, Actions, Appeal, in the letter <hi>A.</hi> with what is in them, and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in any other Letter; (to instance in no more) and I doubt not but he will acknowledge, that there is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference enough between this and the others, though I do make use of them,
<pb facs="tcp:65537:142"/>
as I do of divers other Authors.</p>

                     <hi>Livery of seisin,</hi> is a solemnity that the Law requireth for the passing of a Free-hold, or Lands or Tenements, by delivery of sesin thereof. There be two kinds of livery of seisin, <hi>viz.</hi> a livery in Deed, and a livery in Law. A livery in Deed, is when the Feoffor taketh the ring of the door, or turf, or twig of the Land, and delivereth the same upon the Land to the Feoffee, in the name of seisin of the Land. A livery in Deed may be two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<note place="margin">Cook on Lit. l. 1. c. 7. sect. 59.</note> of waies by a solemn act and words, as by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the ring, or hasp of the door, or by a branch or twig of a tree, or by a turf of the Land; and with these, or the like words, the Feoffor, and Feoffee, both holding the deed of the feoffment, and the ring of the door, hasp, branch, twig, or turf; and the Feoffor saying, Here I deliver you seisin and possession of this house, in the name of seisin, and possession of all the Lands contained in this Deed; or enter you into this house or land, and have and enjoy it according to the Deed; or enter into the house or land, and God give you joy; or I am content you shall enjoy this Land, according to the Deed, or the like. A livery in Law is when the Feoffor saith to the Feoffee, being in<note place="margin">Cook on Lit. l. 1. c. 7. sect. 59. and 5 Rep.

And delivery within the view is good, where there is no deed of feoffment: And such a livery is good, albeit the Land lie in another Countrey.</p>

                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:65537:83"/>There is a diversity between the livery of seisin of land, and the delivery of a Deed; for if a man deliver a Deed without saying of any thing, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The first Grant and the last Will is of greatest force. <hi>Cook on Littleton ibidem, sect.</hi> 168.</p>
                  <p>A Testament is defined <hi>voluntatis nostrae justa sententia de eo quod quis post mortem suam fieri velit, cum executoris institutione,</hi> a declaration of our mind concerning that which we would have done after our deaths, with the ordaining of an executor thereof. <hi>Wests Presidents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every Testament is a last Will, but every last Will is not a Testament, a Testament is one kind of last Will, wherein the Executor is named, who is called <hi>haeres</hi> in the Civil Law.</p>
                  <p>Testaments ought to be proved before the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, unless it be in special Cases, where the Lords have probate of the Testaments of their<note place="margin">Perkins tit. of testam.</note> Tenants, before the Stewards, or themselves in their temporall Courts.</p>
