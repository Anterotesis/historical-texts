            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The moſt Humble Addreſs of the <hi>MAYOR, ALDERMEN, SHERIFFS,</hi> and <hi>COMMON-COUNCIL</hi> of the City of <hi>GLOUCESTER.</hi>

            </opener>
            <p>WE Your Majeſty's moſt humble, loyal, and obedient Subjects, out of a deep ſenſe of Your moſt Princely Tenderneſs, and tranſcendent Care, for us, and all Your good Subjects, as well in reſpect of our Religious as Civil Concerns; Do make this our moſt humble and faithful Addreſs, returning all poſſible Gratitude for Your Majeſty's moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious late Declaration, which hath like a Flood of Goodneſs iſſued from your Royal Heart toward all Your Subjects; whereby all Men that have not wilfully blinded their Intellects, may be abundantly ſatisfied of Your Majeſty's Fatherly Love to us all.</p>
            <p>We cannot but remember by what Frauds and Machinations the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Your Majeſty's Realm in the late Times were beguiled, and under pretext of Religion (and particularly this City, by which there was a moſt deſerved Infamy brought upon us by Men of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Principles, the Dregs of which ſtill remain always watching to diſturb our Peace) cheated into a Rebellion, the Conſequences whereof were a ſad Devaſtation of all, and the loſs of the beſt of Kings. And we have reaſon to believe the ſame deadly Poiſon was again preparing, and had certainly been given, had not GOD put it into Your Majeſty's Heart timely and moſt ſpeedily to prevent it.</p>
            <p>And therefore as we are bound to glorifie God for his Mercy, ſo we make our moſt humble and grateful Acknowledgment to Your Majeſty for Your moſt intent Vigilance to ſave us from ſo portentous a Storm; and do therefore with all Humility and Faithfulneſs proſtrate our ſelves at Your Majeſty's Feet, ſolemnly vowing before God and the whole World, that we are and will be ready to the laſt drop of our Blood, and Mite of our Eſtates, to ſtand by, and defend Your moſt Sacred Perſon, Your lawful Succeſſors, and the juſt Laws by which You govern, both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>The God of Heaven and Earth by whom Kings reign bleſs you with length of days, health, and all affluence of Wealth; eſtabliſh Your Sacred Perſon in the Hearts of Your People; diſſipate your Enemies, and confound their Devices; and let the Scepter of <hi>Great Britain</hi> be ſwayed by You, and Your lawful Succeſſors, to the end of Time.</p>
