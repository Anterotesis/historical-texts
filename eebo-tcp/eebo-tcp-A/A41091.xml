            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and relation here in Oxford: And in the firſt ranke muſt acquaint you, that the ſentence of Death is paſſed againſt the two Captaines that were taken priſoners by his Maieſties Army in <hi>Brainford:</hi> They were tryed for their lives before the Lord Chiefe Iuſtice Sir <hi>Robert Heath,</hi> and were indicted as guilty of High Treaſon, for that being ſubiecty both unto his Maieſtie, they took up rebellious Armes againſt him. They pleaded for their lives very boldly, eſpecially Captaine <hi>Lilborne,</hi> who being but a man of low fortunes, hath aroſe to the degree of a Captaine, by the boldneſſe of his ſpirit. He ſpoke much for himſelfe, and alledged he much wondred at the proceedings of the Charge againſt him, the Law paſſing upon him as he had beene a Felon, and not a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that he honoured his Maieſty as much as any there preſent, and that the preſervation of his ſacred perſon was as tender to him, that hee was ſo far from taking up Armes againſt his King, that the only end he made in all this ſervice, was by the loſſe of his bloud to procure ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his Maieſty, and peace unto the Kingdome, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring what in him lay to pluck him from the hands of thoſe who infuſed bad counſaile into his ſacred eares. Notwithſtanding all this, the Iurie paſſed upon him, and found him guilty of high treaſon, the ſentence of death was pronounced againſt him by the L. <hi>Heath:</hi> this is the day of his execution, in my next letter I will at full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the manner of it: in the meane time I muſt beſeech you to certifie us with the proceedings of your Citizens Petition for peace, which will bee very welcome newes unto us all, eſpecially unto him who is,</p>

            <p>GOD looking from Heaven, and beholding the miſerable eſtate of this Nation, which he in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for the delinquencie of ſinne had puniſhed with civill war, doth begin to pitty us again, and to ſhew that mercy is the direct attribute of his eſſence, he will ſoften the hearts of men to receive an accommodation of peace, that the ſword may no longer cut downe the youth and moſt generous ſpirits of this Land. There hath beene bloud enough, and too much already ſpent in a private quarrell, which by <hi>Plebeian wits</hi> was never hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto well underſtood; and <hi>Kenton field</hi> will be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by poſterity with much griefe, ſince ſo many there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in did loſe their fathers, husbands, brothers, nay the bloud of all ſorts of kindred was mingled together, and could not be diſtinguiſhed. And what was the cauſe of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall battaile? why the common people were led on by ungrounded opinions, and pay, to cut the throats of their brethren, the Proteſtant was expoſed to fight in maintaining the unlearned humorous conceits of the Browniſts and other Sectaries, being villianous people, and ſuch as have bin the great diſturbers of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; they endeavoured the fall of the true Religion, and to bring in new Doctrines, which with much impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they brayed out in Convinticles, and had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers enough, equall to themſelves for weake heads, and ſhallow underſtandings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62877:4"/>
The Citie and Countrey carried up their fancies with all the ſtrength they could make, and applauding new inventions, grateful to nature, they began to diſpiſe the Church, and Clergy, nay the Common prayer, as things ancient, and not fit for ſervice. Hereupon ſouldiers, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to maintaine any cauſe, flocked together, and being ready (for pay) to iuſtifie any quarrell, a great battaile was fought at <hi>Kenton,</hi> with much loſſe on both ſides, and pitty it was that ſo many of the Nobility and Gentry ſhould bee loſt in ſuch a battaile, where ſo much cruelty was acted in ſo ſhort a time. But though men prove more fierce then Tygers, and ready to ſheath their ſwords in one anothers bodies, yet the hand of God can ſtay their hands when they are lifted up in greateſt fury; and when his good pleaſure is, he can both perſwade and command a peace, and the warre cannot paſſe beyond the bounds which his his divine providence hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but as for other hopes to ſee peace, he will make us beholding to his divine bounty. For now after theſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious paſſages of a civill war, he doth make ſome hearts to fall off from the proſecuting this deſtroying work of ruine, by maintaining war within this land, which muſt needs eat up the fruits thereof, and bring it to a deſpiſed and wretched poverty, other nations with pleaſure look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon our calamities. And ſince it is a principle, that all things muſt move from ſome beginning to an end, the Citie hath begun to bring about this great deſired work of peace, and to ſet a mark upon ſuch as doe oppoſe the common vote of the people, and doe cry up warre, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by their violent faction; they have therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed a way to diſtinguiſh ſuch as bee deſirous of peace, from the other who are either cold to embrace it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain to oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62877:4"/>
But indeed who can oppoſe the inſcrutable works of God, plotted by many ſecret wayes, to manifeſt his Glorie; therefore if he will this worke of peace ſhall with a ſwift motion goe forward in deſpight of all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, let all the <hi>heads round</hi> about this Citie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to ſlack and ſtay thoſe intended propoſitions to the Parliament for peace, let the waves of tumult make the Shippe of the Church and Common-wealth worke to the Haven of ſafety, yet at laſt it ſhall conquer the tempeſt of ignorance, of ſcandall and envie, rayſed by thoſe mouthes of ignorance, that blow ſuch violent croſſe winds to caſt it away.</p>
            <p>Behold the King with his Scepter is ready to oppoſe theſe waves, to compoſe this ſtorme, and ſhall any date to be movers and diſturbers of this calme of happy <hi>peace?</hi> No, ſtand now for God, the King, the Parliament, and peace: You have now many good &amp; great cauſes, united in one, then let your hearts ſtand firme in contrarietie to thoſe Vipers, that would eare a paſſage out of their mothers Wombs; thoſe empty clouds of ignorance, that hover about till they are driven away by the cleare Sun ſhine of the Goſpell. Your City is wiſe, and full of grave Senators, that can with cleare iudgements looke into the Ambition and Bloudy thoughts of all Sects; therefore, now if your hearts bee inclinable to peace, perſwade your ſelves (as indeed it is) that nothing can be more acceptable to God, your King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, then a well grounded peace. Would you have this land, the ancient ſeat of plenty and proſperity, embrace peace? or if you deſire to ſee the King in his peaceable Throne againe, and enioy all happineſſe under his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb facs="tcp:62877:5"/>
reigne, embrace peace: Or doe you wiſh for the peace and quietneſſe of your conſciences, of the Church and State, embrace and moſt willingly yeeld to peace. But what need we doubt it, for if your wiſedome faile not, you will with all cheerefulneſſe ſeeke this peace ſo much oppoſed, if calamities may come within the view of of your underſtanding, there's ſorrow, griefe, bloud, loſſe, violence, murther, and all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of warre dayly extant and acted, and can there bee happineſſe in this? is there muſick in the groanes of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men? is it ioy to ſee teares ſtanding in the eyes of this father, this husband, this mother and that brother, for the death of their comfort in their ſeverall relations. Then you may roundly conclude, that war is to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to peace, murther and ſlaughter before life and ſafety, and the Kingdomes ruine before the generall good of the Kingdome. But if the contrarie bee true, (as all wiſe men doe acknowledge) then downe with thoſe ambitious, irreligious people, that cry down peace, and let all other people pray and endeavour for peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and all his true hearted ſubiects.</p>
