            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen this Play came first abroad into the World, it found the approbation of the most Excellent Persons, and best Masters of this Kind of Writing which were in that time, if there were ever better in any time; <hi>Ben. Johnson</hi> being then alive, who gave a Testimonie of this Piece even to be Envy'd. Nor doe I know more than One Objection, that was ever made against it, Which was, The indecorum that appear'd to Some in the Part of <hi>Cleander,</hi> who being represented a Person of seventeen yeares of age, is made to speak words, that would better sute with the age of thirty. But the Answer that was given to One, that cried out upon the <hi>Monsterousnesse</hi> and <hi>Impossibilitie</hi> of this thing, the first day of the Presentation of this Play at the <hi>Black-Friers,</hi> by the Lord Viscount <hi>Faulkland,</hi> may satisfie All Others; and if the Considerablenesse of the Answer, and Answerer, be duly weigh'd, may serve no lesse for an Ornament and Patronage to the Author. The passage was thus. This Noble Person, having for some time suffered the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and impertinent Dislikes of this Auditor, when he made this last Exception, forbore him no longer, but (though he were one he knew not) told him, <hi>Sir, 'tis not altogether so Monsterous and Impossible, for One of Seventeen yeares to speak at such a Rate, when He that made him speak in that manner, and writ the whole Play, was Himself no Older.</hi> I shall say no more of the Worth, or former Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion had of this Piece, it being in hand, to shew what it Merits, or Merits not.</p>
            <p>A few things I have to adde, concerning my present Publication, which are these. That this Play never saw the light in its true Shape till this day: a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Impression there has been of it, but One, not onely deform'd with all the Errors of an Uncorrected Presse, but what might else proceed from a false and imperfect Transcript; the Originall Coppy being then (together with the Writer of it) in <hi>Italy.</hi> Who was so farre from consenting to the printing of his Book at that time, that he had not then Corrected those parts of it, which he was forc'd to passe over with lesse care, by reason of the hasty calling of it out of his hands, by the Entertainment for which it was desig'nd. So that (I may say) the former Impression is no better than a <hi>Corrupted Fragment,</hi> or <hi>Foul Draught,</hi> of what this Play was intended, and differing so much from what it now is, that if the Corrections, Expungings, and Additions, be consider'd, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the one half otherwise. This hath made me likewise impose a New Name upon it: for it is a Creature now wholly at my Disposition, and belonging to me, not as to a Plagiarie, but a Susceptor, or Foster-father, that has taken up this Child long since Ejected by the True Parent. And my desire, is to have it shew as little Affinity and Resemblance as is possible to its Anti-type; whose Prejudices it can no way better remove from it self, than by shewing them False, and Despising them.</p>

                  <l>Like our Lands at first, is ty'd to the Crown.</l>
                  <l>Kings comes near unto the Gods, and are like them</l>

                  <l>Kings are more miserable, than they seem</l>
                  <l>Happy; flatter'd by themselves and others,</l>
                  <l>Into a joy that is not, and what they feel,</l>
                  <l>They rather do imagine than find so.</l>
                  <l>Yet I grant too, a King may be happy,</l>
                  <l>But not then as a King. Felicity</l>
                  <l>Is a Purchase, and no Inheritance,</l>
                  <l>Nor has the Prerogative more than one life</l>

Sir, have you any business with him? You need no other Orator than such as this; such a Mouth without a Tongue, will perswade any thing. Yet this is o'th least, fit onely for Physick-dayes, when he would not surfeit; a meer Toy that troubles the Wayters with often filling. But I have One, as high—Here's nothing to measure't by; but 'twas that made me so In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with him; I alwayes use to Petition him with it; 'tis bigger than any of his own, and pleas'd him above Measure. The first time he saw it, he commended the Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of my Mind, and said it was a Noble Emulation in me! He has a Daughter Sir, a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Lady, my Hopes, unless some Neighbour-Prince do Reel betwixt us. Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness comes the right way, he hates a dry, In-land Traveller; but that you Kiss the Cup, when you should Drink; and have too much Bounce, and Down-with-him in you; which are things he surfeited of, some sixteen years since, and still the very Names turn his stomack. Besides, your Navy and Attendants are too great, he'd have esteemed more of you, had they been fewer, enough onely to lean on, when you were Overtaken; or if you had wanted those, and borrowed his unto your Chamber, it had been better: Where he finds Worth, the Pomp delights him not.

                  <l>Me thoughts the King, and my Lord <hi>Timem,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Lookt like the Father, and the Son. The King</l>
                  <l>Had on his Old Councell Face, which all hope't</l>
                  <l>He had forgot, and this was the onely time</l>
                  <l>These many Yeares, he should not have worn it.</l>
                  <l>They both imbrac't the Stranger as coldly,</l>
                  <l>And carelesly, as I have seen our Common</l>
                  <l>Fencers doe, that are immediately</l>
                  <l>To Fight with one another after. This</l>
                  <l>Behaviour in the Great Ones, was presently</l>
                  <l>Observ'd like a New Fashion, and in</l>
                  <l>An instant the whole Court was in't, from the</l>
                  <l>Bravest, to those that follow a Fashion</l>
                  <l>Onely, when 'tis to leave off something, I mean</l>
                  <l>Our poorer Gallants that go in <hi>Quirpo,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And look not as if they were Hot, but wanted</l>
                  <l>A Cloak. Marry their wits were not so Changeable</l>
                  <l>As their Faces, and having but One Sute</l>
                  <l>Of Complement, and that now Unfashionable,</l>
                  <l>They were fain to supplie it with Leggs, and Silence.</l>

                  <l>Much above it, in my Opinion, two foot</l>
                  <l>Higher than my Lord <hi>Timem,</hi> though not</l>
                  <l>Altogether so tall. These sour Looks, were</l>
                  <l>All the Without-door Shew, which ended,</l>
                  <l>In a solemn March, they returned all into</l>

I see too, and more particularlie, that 'tis not Death, but a Dream of Death one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that hangs on me; Some ill Vapours of the Spleen, bred from Noise of Warre, hearing of Murders, Varietie of Danger, and no Feasting. The King, my bountifull and loving Master, was kill'd suddainlie; his Son deserted by the Armie and the whole Kingdome, on the Newes, scap't hardiie with his Life, a few friends and followers to this Fort: where, with as much adoe, we shut our Selves in, and our Enemies out; But Honour, a subtiler and more pernicious Adversarie than all the rest, shuffled it self into the Hold with us, and has never ceas'd one minute since, in its Own Name, and the Name of Honestie, of the Condition we have Lost, and the Disgraces we were to expect, to present us with Halters, Daggers, Poyson, any thing that might give us (as she term'd it) a Noble End. I must confesse, I am not for these Melanchollie Things, my Ends have still lain otherwise. 'Tis true, I bear on me the Dignitie of a Lord. But how? As a Pedler does his pack, upon my Shoulders, not in my Heart. And what is Honour at the best? But a bare Name onely; and not alwayes so much to me: the Title was never given me Seriouslie, but by Rascals; with my Fellow Peeres (if I pleas'd 'em in the Feast) I was my Lord <hi>Comastes,</hi> If not, <hi>Comastes-with-my-face-full-of-Sauce,</hi> and my Locks of Liquour, my hair and beard dropping like a Wine-presse, as if my being there were not to Drink the Wine, but Make it. But again, I have a Lordship in Land to loose, as well as Title. What then? shall I sell my Life for Dirt? My Soul for a few Acres? I'le batter the World too for a Grave, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain't I make as Wise a Bargain. But say this Land be taken from me, pray how came I by it? Was it the Inheritance of my Noble Father, or the Purchase of my own Wit? Good Yeoman-of-the-Bottles Sleep in peace; your Sonnes Being was from you, but his Well-Being, and his Dignities, from his proper Vertues. Which as the Philosopher wisely observes, <hi>in no fortune leave the Owner.</hi> And while the Sciences of Eating, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Fooling, and the like, are held in Estimation, I cannot want a Lordship. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well therefore all Dreames and Meditations of the Other World, my Making was for this; your <hi>Elizium</hi> with Sweet Shades, and purling Streames, does not one whit entice me, for when they have said all they can, 'tis still to be Dead, to be there. And having happilie broken from the Companie of my Noble Associates, I'le yoak no more with 'em, till I see what becomes of their Magnanimities: but thus as I am, alone, with warie steps I'le march unto the New Court; and doe not Despair, though the King and State be Chang'd, to continue still the same Man.</p>

               <lg>
                  <l>WHen petty Pleasures are procur'd with Gold,</l>
                  <l>When youth is gone, and we decrpeid old,</l>
                  <l>There's no more <hi>Gusto</hi> than a Tale twice told.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The greatest Monarchs, while they flourished,</l>
                  <l>Were honour'd and ador'd; but being dead,</l>
                  <l>Were soon forgot, and only pitied.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>So that whatever Marble Tombs pretend,</l>
                  <l>All their gay glories never can defend</l>
                  <l>Their pamper'd bodies from the Beggar's end.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> both became</l>
                  <l>The highest splendor of a glorious Name;</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>So that when Men have all the World subdu'd,</l>
                  <l>They may themselves, and all their Fame delude,</l>
                  <l>Unless they do in Piety conclude.</l>

                  <l>The idle Fancies of a busie Brain,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>These serious Thoughts are Caveats to despise</l>

                  <l>And captivate our Senses in disguise.</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For we are born to learn, and to express,</l>

               <l>PUre honest Poverty in former times,</l>
               <l>Was no disgrace; but now our latter Crimes</l>
               <l>Have introduc'd new kinds of punishments,</l>
               <l>To expiate our sins, for old Contempts</l>
               <l>In luxury, and such profuse expence,</l>
               <l>That we are now chastiz'd for that offence,</l>
               <l>With Penury, to make us own our shame,</l>
               <l>And free all present accidents from blame:</l>
               <l>Which from God's mercy now to us is sent,</l>
               <l>To make our most obdurate hearts repent.</l>
               <l>And yet there may such poverty proceed</l>
               <l>From wicked Men, whose malice have decreed</l>
               <l>Our ruine, to get wealth for their support,</l>
               <l>In spight of right, or their damnation for't.</l>
               <l>And such absurd, base scandals do invent,</l>
               <l>That no man's innocence can e'er prevent.</l>
               <l>From such Devils, good Lord, deliver me,</l>

               <l>Like gilded Fools, that only learn of late</l>

               <p>IT has been asked, How a Soul may know when her Sins are forgiven? and answered thus: When she finds the same affection to God, with his that said, <hi>I hate iniquity, and all false ways I utterly abhorr.</hi> Yet <hi>David,</hi> who said so, did die, and so must we. Tho' our Souls may, by the same grace, become of the same temper with his, and our sins be forgiven too; yet we may consider how few Men do slip out of this World into eternity, with a joyful hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty delight to be with God (through divine Love) which is the highest perfection of an holy life; and is our greatest assurance to manifest our sins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, when our Souls are by faith so fixed on God, as to know no joy so great as such spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts do raise, when we desire to be in Heaven; which taught <hi>David</hi> to hate iniquity, and to abhorr all false ways; and so reduced him from all his sins, to become a man after God's own Heart.</p>

But if we do believe in Christ's plenteous Redemption, with GOD's immense Mercy to deliver us from Hell's eternal Torments, and exalt us unto <hi>Heaven</hi>'s eternal Joy and Glory; it may be justly said, Happy is that Man who can obtain such a Reconciliation with GOD before he die (as daily to delight in the Meditation of a sudden Death, with inward assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his eternal Bliss the moment he expires) which is the highest Exaltation of Joy on Earth, and will be the greatest Comfort at the hour of Death; and ought to be the chief Business of all Men to live and die so, who do march every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from our Cradles, dying, towards our Graves.</p>

               <l>And all our meaner Objects we disown:</l>

               <l>Vainly thinking some diviner Grace</l>
               <l>May smooth afflictions with a smiling face;</l>
               <l>When sighs and tears (if they come not too late)</l>

               <l>And may expect to find more Penitents</l>

               <p>I Have read in a divine Author, That if God be with us, he will make us see that he is with us; and will not depart from our sight, until he has brought us never to depart out of his. Which is a Lesson of high concern to Men in this World; for Thus to enjoy God here, is to be in Heaven before we die. When our Souls are thus transported with a continual divine Conversation with Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, we may taste and relish his celestial Joys to some degree, so as to envite us to value his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Comforts above all carnal Fruitions. So that our great Business is to improve this Blessing to the highest reach of humane Fancy, by a daily practice of holy Meditations, to contemplate and observe how God doth infuse this joyful enjoying of Him into our Souls, by the secret working of the Holy Ghost; when we set our selves with zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous integrity to find him there, to converse with us on this great lesson of his immense Mercy, with our humble prayers to be enlightned from above, to participate of such angelical Delights, as far as our frail Nature will admit of; which by frequent use, will bring us to such an habit of holy living, that <hi>God</hi> will manifest his presence ever with us, by an inward Felicity of divine Comforts, to such an assurance of our Election unto eternal Bliss, as is ineffable to be described: So that when we raise our Thoughts with a divine Desire, to know as much of <hi>God</hi> as we can know, and of his being with us, he will add of his <hi>Grace</hi> to enlarge our Capacities to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59206:42"/>
such heavenly Trances in Devotion, that we shall be with him, and he with us, as we do wish, with such a joy as will dread all diverting Occasions that shall obstruct those Emanations of his holy Spirit working in us.</p>
               <p>And thus if we do entertain our selves by such frequent addresses to find <hi>God,</hi> he will daily meet, and ever dwell with us, if we unfelgnedly desire to dwell with him; and will give us such a glimpse of his eternal Bliss, as may fix our hearts on Heaven, and make us live every moment in a joyful Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Death's quickest Summons thither; and by this frequent entertainment of thy Soul with <hi>God,</hi> Thou, my Friend, wilt find such a communication with <hi>God</hi> on Earth, to be the highest Perfection of Piety, and a felicity much more delightful than all other Diversions, which can never reach such Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphick Joys, as I wish to thee my Friend.</p>

               <head>On the Fear of Death.</head>
               <p>IF we fully consider our manifold Sins, and the horrid Judgment due unto us for them, it may well be said, Happy is that Man who can obtain such a Reconciliation with God before he die, as daily to delight in the meditation of a sudden death, with inward assurance of his eternal Bliss the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he expires. Because all our <hi>Ideas</hi> of the divine Felicities above, do seldom invite Men to welcome Death with cheerful Hearts: Our fears are so much stronger than our Faith, that too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men do rather think, than find they do believe that Christ's plenteous Redemption will cancel all their Crimes, and bring them into Heaven; and therefore dare not really rejoyce to look on death; but start back from such angelick Happiness, as he brings good Men to participate of, in God's eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory; which natural infirmity of doubting, can only, by an illustrious Faith, be removed; and that Faith, by frequent Prayers, be obtained. Then, thus to live, and so to die, will make us live and die in great tranquility, though not to reach St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Faith, who saw <hi>Heaven</hi> open to him; yet to so great a degree of divine Raptures in Devotion, as to be filled with elevations of an inward assurance of our Election, which must come from God, when the Soul is in such a blessed Trance of celestial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that is ineffable to be described. How near such joy is to the joy we read of in Paradise; when fervent Zeal is by a lively Faith so raised, and sixed in God by frequent Meditations, it is a wonder that such Men can fear to die, or doubt togo to God with cheerful Hearts, when thus invited, and thus led by his holy Spirit, with such bright illuminations of surprizing joys, while those divine Flames last,

as cannot be related. When Men's hearts are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with such Seraphick high Transports of Love and Mercy from Almighty God, to give true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents some taste of their eternal Glory; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus enlightned, they may not fear to die; but rather welcome death, who comes to carry them to Heaven, which is the highest Exaltation of the Soul's joy, so to delight in God, that the expectation of Heaven may be more pleasant, than all the momentary Fruitions of this World are, compared unto a blessed incomprehensible Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</p>

               <p>IF all Men did our Christian Graces understand, That like good Heraulds we might rank them according to their antiquity and merit, <hi>Faith</hi> may claim the highest dignity and place, as of just right, to be the most fixed foundation on the blessed Rock of our Salvation, which will, unmov'd, withstand the greatest Storms, when lofty Structures built on Sand, are, with Wind and Rain, soon tumbled down. And if we mind those mighty Miracles of the first <hi>Ages,</hi> they all relate unto <hi>Faith.</hi> Our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour also used to say, <hi>Whosoever believeth in me, shall never die:</hi> (Do you believe that I can do this? and then, Be it done according to your <hi>Faith) Thy Faith has made thee whole.</hi> The Woman with the bloody Issue, had no other application for her Cure but <hi>Faith.</hi>

               <l>Without <hi>Faith,</hi> what signifies our Creed?</l>
               <l>And to what purpose did our Saviour bleed!</l>
               <l>If we all Doubting could from Faith divide,</l>
               <l>Pure Faith would then in greatest triumph ride.</l>

               <head>How to delight in GOD.</head>
               <p>THe Text says, <hi>Delight in the Lord, and he will give thee thy hearts desire:</hi> And no doubt but if we delight in him, with the highest faculty of our Souls (above all carnal appetites) with contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his glorious <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Attributes,</hi> in frequent fervent Prayers, with continual Gratitude for his daily Mercies. To adore him as we might, we should find such a rejoycing in God, to be the most voluptuous felicity that the heart of Man is capable of. But we mock our selves too often with a belief of this Felicity, by a careless searching short in our own Hearts, for a clear proof of the divine Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this delighting in God; which every Man must find in himself; for no Man can correct the unseen Errours of his Neighbour's heart. So that it must be every Man's concern to examine his own Conscience, how much he rejoyces in God, more than in all worldly Fruitions; and according to his proportion in excelling therein, his peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science will prove the more exalted joyful Feast, and will create in him the greatest hope of his heart's promised desire, and is the surest way to remove our natural Fear of Death, who only can lead us to glory; which all Men ought to think on, more than all other affairs in this World: For if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in God as we ought,</p>
               <l>We should the clear intrinsick value find,</l>
               <l>When Grace enriches a delighted Mind,</l>
               <l>That trusts in God; and by such bless'd converse,</l>
               <l>Excells all pleasures of the Universe,</l>
               <l>Which no Man's Faith nor Fancy can conceive,</l>
               <l>Till that delightful practice gives him leave:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59206:46"/>
Then Souls enlightned by that holy fire,</l>
               <l>Will pass to Paradise when they expire;</l>
               <l>An higher Bliss can no Man's heart desire</l>
               <l>Though worldly joys may all our Senses please,</l>
               <l>The Soul's joy makes them all but a disease.</l>
               <l>But when God's glory in our Souls doth shine,</l>
               <l>It shews those holy Raptures are divine.</l>
               <p>Yet we ought not to think, that every petty pleasing Object that assaults our Senses, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Name of a Delight, more than little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have for every new Baby they do see. But when the Soul's supreme delight is so fixed on God, that every address brings men as near to him as Souls can come while they are involved in Clay; yet by a flaming Zeal, and such high mounting Faith, as doth believe that God is every-where, and Heaven with him, and them, are altogether at that time there. Where such joys may grow up to such a divine Delight in God, as will come nearest unto his beatick sight (tho' few Men seek it by such practice as we might) and therefore cannot fansie such tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending Bliss on Earth, as those her metick Livers have, who daily do converse in Heaven, with great delight, in expectation of a quick Summons thither; and such Piety may be truly called, <hi>Delighting in God.</hi>

               <p>MY good Old Friend, why so sad? does thy Age decline so fast? that the <hi>Idea</hi> of thy Grave frights thee with fear to die. Are we not all dying? and none knows who shall go next, nor how soon be gone; if this occasion thy dismay, I will teach thee an Antidote that will dispell the Poyson of that Serpent's bite, and turn that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal curse of Death, into a State of Bliss; if thou can'st raise thy dejected Spirit to a quick sense of snaring the Eternal Joys of Heaven, with those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59206:50"/>
Saints, who by Faith, Prayer, and Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, are now exalted thither.</p>
               <p>Let thy melancholy Meditations and Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Grave, be changed from a Gaol deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; into a constant, chearful, zealous Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in thy Divine Retirements, with God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; by a total Resignation of thy Soul, and all thy concerns unto them; and think with pleasure how near thou art arrived to thy Journeys end, to be with them in Paradise. Then such Celestial Thoughts will be thy most pleasant entertainment, and surely meet with surprising joy from Faith in Christ's plenteous Redemption; which will beget a hearty, speedy welcome unto Death's arrival, who comes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct thee to Eternal Bliss; and thou wilt also find, that every devout step towards this felicity of thy approaching Salvation; will make thy heart dance with a Saint-like delight, to baffle the terrors of the Grave; with a serene prospect of thy Eternal Happiness at hand; and so make thy last hours full of Angelical transporting joy to be with God, the moment thy Soul expires; fix thy heart thus, and all sad Thoughts will vanish, when a sincere Faith becomes predominant.</p>
               <p>Thy Heart by practice, will delight in this Divine Elixir of Eternal Bliss.</p>
