            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>you'll hear of their departing.</l>
               <l>They walk together up and down,</l>
               <l>to tell each others mind,</l>
               <l>His Friend gave to him half a crown,</l>
               <l>there's twelve pence more behind.</l>
               <l>It is agreed betwixt them both,</l>
               <l>that they ſhould ſpend the ſhilling;</l>
               <l>Then Taffy ſwears a binding Oah,</l>
               <l>that he was not unwilling.</l>
               <l>It is agreed that they ſhould dine,</l>
               <l>both at a houſe together,</l>
               <l>They quickly call'd for bread and wine,</l>
               <l>as ſoon as they came thither:</l>
               <l>Each others health doth now go round,</l>
               <l>for they are void of care,</l>
               <l>The wine did Taffy quite confound,</l>
               <l>for he hath drank his ſhare.</l>
               <l>Some words between theſe Friends there paſt,</l>
               <l>about their noble blood.</l>
               <l>Then up ſtarts Taffy all in haſte,</l>
               <l>his Friend had croſt his mood:</l>

               <l>and then he knockt him down.</l>
               <l>This being done, the People came,</l>

               <l>but it was nothing ſo:</l>

                  <hi>His</hi> head was broke, as I may ſay,</l>
               <l>which to the heart did grieve him,</l>
               <l>It was not well the other day,</l>
               <l>if that you will believe him.</l>
               <l>Now Tafty knows not what to do,</l>
               <l>but he pays it off with thinking,</l>
               <l>It grieves him now I tell you true,</l>
               <l>to loſe his Friend by drinking.</l>
               <l>Well, by the Law it is agreed,</l>
               <l>that Taffy muſt reſtore</l>
               <l>Fall three and four pence for the deed,</l>
               <l>to pay the bloody ſcore.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>He</hi> pays it then with all his heart,</l>
               <l>was glad he eſcaped ſo,</l>
               <l>And he ſeeks for to depart,</l>
               <l>but e're that he muſt go,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>His</hi> Landlord then to him did ſav,</l>
               <l>Pav what thou oweſt me,</l>
               <l>For there is twenty pence to pay,</l>
               <l>which I expect of thee.</l>
               <l>Cots ſplut, was tell hur what was due,</l>
               <l>as hur may clear the ſcore,</l>
               <l>Was break hur head hur tell to you,</l>
               <l>and give her five groats more,</l>
               <l>For hur has broke hur Brother's head,</l>
               <l>and unto hur hath given</l>
               <l>Full three and four pence for the deed,</l>
               <l>'twixt nine groats and eleven.</l>
               <l>Then hereupon away he goes,</l>
               <l>he leaves the ſcore to pay,</l>
               <l>But where he is, there's no Man knows,</l>
               <l>for he is fled away.</l>

Now Taffy's ſilver is all gone,</l>
               <l>there's not a penny left,</l>
               <l>And he travels all alone,</l>
               <l>to ſeek another ſhift:</l>
               <l>Into a travern then he goes,</l>
               <l>to be a Servant there,</l>
               <l>Becauſe canary, Taffy knows,</l>
               <l>is better than ſmall-beer.</l>
               <l>It was agreed for him to go,</l>
               <l>a Drawer for to be,</l>
               <l>No wages unto him they give,</l>
               <l>becauſe he was not free:</l>
               <l>Now he is willing for to ſerve</l>
               <l>at any poor condition,</l>
               <l>That he might not with hunger ſtarve,</l>
               <l>was glad of that profeſſion.</l>
               <l>Yet he is ſubject unto jeers,</l>
