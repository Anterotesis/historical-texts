            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>3. For Example; Common places for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
* <hi>To prove any thing to be good,</hi> may be such as
these;—</p>
            <p>—Because tis the chief end, all men, or the wisest of
men, aim at—all, or the wisest commend—because
it produceth some good—preventeth or remedieth
some evil—procures us much pleasure,—profit,
—reputation,—honors,—things, we account good.
—is rewarded—is difficult to attain—is contrary to
all excess, &amp;c.—is dictated by nature—is followed
with content—other things for its sake accounted
good, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. * <hi>To prove any thing more good,</hi> such as these;</p>
            <p>—Because tis the end, and so more worthy than
the means—chosen for its self, and not for another
—conducing to a better, worthier end—conversant
about a nobler object—can better be without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than the other without it—is the cause of the
other—more beneficial—beneficial to more—more
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55317:6"/>
rare—more beautiful—more lasting—more reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
—more easie to be procured (for on both sides ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
are probable)—more pursued by wise
men—better, according to circumstance of person,
time, place, action, &amp;c.—Any of whichmediums,
<hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> is perswasive.</p>
            <p>5. The contraries serve, * <hi>To prove a thing evil, or less
good. * To aggravate a Crime,</hi> such as these, drawn</p>
            <p>—From the greatness of the dammage—the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
of reparation—from the quality of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
by whom; to whom—from doing it alone; or
first; or often—with no, with small, benefit to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
—with a determinate purpose, having no plausible
motive toit—not very feasible;—from its being a
thing contrary to nature—to express law—savour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of brutishness, and inhumanity—Done in a
holy place, in the court, &amp;c.—in such a time—against
a Kinsman, a Benefactor, a Magistrate—giving so
much scandal—so much encouragement.</p>
            <p>6. * To extenuate a fault;</p>
            <p>—That it was not done at all—not so done—
that it was done so; but that it was well done—
not well done; but yet of those things that are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
pardoned—that it was not an injury—but an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
a misfortune—not done with an ill mind—not
with deliberation—that not a part onely, but the whole
action be considered—not that action, but the whole
course of his life—what good, as well as what evil, he
hath done—not to regard the words of the Law, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55317:6"/>
the intent of the Law-giver—not the Law (failing in
particulars,) but equity.</p>
            <p>7. All Discourses are either

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55317:7"/>
to a Consequence
that all grant to be false; from
their <hi>Genus, Definition, Division,</hi>
&amp;c. Amongst which * Similitudes
(<hi>i. e.</hi> Like Cases resembling it:)
* Contraries (which much manifest
one another:)* Examples, Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Suppositions and Reduction
<hi>ad absurdum,</hi> are diligently to be
sought out; proving a thing many
times much more, than reasons to
our Auditory; who, when by the
one they see not how it can be
done; by the other they easily see
that it is done; and therefore <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplum</hi>
is not in vain made one
species of argumentation.</p>
            <p>8. Several Examples of Arguments drawn from
such Topicks. As; <hi>From effects, Scipio</hi> was a better
General then <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he conquered <hi>Hannibal.</hi>—He
is valiant, for he feared not death.—<hi>From the Instrument;</hi>
He killed him, for his weapon was found in the wound—
<hi>From the Antecedents;</hi> He killed him, for hethreatned
his death, went out by night armed, way-layd him.
—<hi>From Circumstances; Cic. Clodius</hi> laid wait for <hi>Milo,</hi>
and not <hi>Milo</hi> for <hi>Clodius: He</hi> went forth with lusty
servants armed; <hi>This</hi> with a few women; <hi>He</hi> mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55317:7"/>
on horse-back; <hi>This</hi> in a Coach.—<hi>From the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents;
Sylla</hi> took not up arms for ambition sake,
witness the resigned Dictatorship.—<hi>A majori;</hi> If
lawful to kill an Adulterer, tis so to beat him.—Who
hath committed sacriledge, will not scruple to commit a
theft.—<hi>A minori;</hi> If Theft a capital crime,
much more Sacriledge. <hi>From Similies;</hi> If Continency
be a vertue, then such is Absti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nence.—As Mariners
can do nothing without a Pilot, so neither Souldiers
without a Commander.—<hi>From Conjugates;</hi> an honest
thing it is to learn, therefore to teach.—<hi>From Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
If War be the cause of all evils, Peace is the
remedy of them.—If he deserve pardon who wrongs
one unawares, he merits a reward, who purposely
doth one a favor.—<hi>From Contradictories;</hi> When he
refused to entertain him having all mens approbation,
would the same entertain him with so many mens of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence?
—<hi>From Division;</hi> That any one be a Citizen,
he must either be born, or made so; but he neither of
these—<hi>So from Dilemmas;</hi> where either side chosen
evinceth the same thing:—Putting a man to the rack, no
sure way to discover truth: for either he can endure
the pains, and then he will lie amidst his torment; or
he cannot endure them, and then he will say any thing,
to end them. See concerning these Topicks <hi>Quintil.
Instit. l. 5. c.</hi> 10. &amp;c. and the first and second Book
of <hi>Aristotles</hi> Rhetorick.</p>
            <p>9. Now there being infinite other
places of Arguments besides these,
(especially where the subject is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55317:8"/>
more complexe) and many of these
not furnishing any one subject, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
with very trivial and common
matter (which is to be rejected)
they are onely set down to give
hints to your invention whilest yet
unpractised; which, when more
exercised, will presently repair to
those chiefly serviceable, and less
accommodable to other subjects,
without at all saluting the rest.</p>
            <p>10. Invention on most subjects is
to look two wayes. To prove in the
first place; in the second to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove:
to confirm, and then to
confute; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to state
first; and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to make
and answer objections. (There
being nothing, that so much can be
said for, but something also may
be said against it) which affords
a double field of matter to be
drawn from these, and such like
heads. The first part useth to be
more solid; the second, more acute.
Hence the natural parts of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
are, 1. an Exordium or P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55317:8"/>
2. Declaring and proving
our own Positions. 3. Refuting
the contrary; 4. A short recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and concluding, called <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oratio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. In all our Proofs we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to, either things of sense;
or common received Axioms, and
Truths, or Laws, and Customes,
or the Concessions of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
or of our Auditors. Neither
is it needful to ascend to the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Causes of every thing, but
to stay our Probation at our Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
grants.</p>

your fancy too much at first;
either in the quest of more curious
matter, or in setting it down in the
most exact form. For, besides that
the mind doth more heavily and
less accurately, perform many
things at once; the Wit especially,
is of so delicate a sharpness, that
any forcing presently turns the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55317:9"/>
edge; and where we make too
much difficulty, it becomes onely
amazed and astonished; and thus
circumscribed and limited to none
but extraordinary productions,
like a pent flame, it blazeth not
the more for this, but is rather
choked and put out. <hi>De ingenio suo
pessimè merentur</hi> (saith <hi>Quintil.)
qui diligentiam putant, facere sibi
scribendi difficultatem.</hi> The best
way therefore is, * to give it leave to
expatiate it self in its work, and
heat, and grow more active by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
* to take what it sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neously
produceth; and pass by,
what it doth not readily pass
through; which (like the deficient
memory) at another attempt, or,
by and by, at the same, answereth
of its own accord our formerly-frustrated
expectation. What order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
matter therefore, it shall (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced)
offer you, set down; that
by this, as a lower step, the Fancy
may ascend, and scrue it self up to
something more choice; which it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55317:9"/>
cannot so easily mount unto at the
first, without taking, by the way,
this meaner rise. But then we must
take the pains of twice writing,<note place="margin">But in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond copying to reject what is slight, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the order, expression, &amp;c.</note>
that the second Copy may cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
(according to its better Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
what is ordinary and common
in the former.</p>
            <p>13. <note place="margin">To expose them rude in writing, rather than burden the memory.</note>Rather than reserve your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
in your mind, till they are
exactly formed, write them down
at first without curiosity, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them after in your Paper: Tis
said of <hi>Virgil,</hi> that he drew out his
matter first in Prose, then compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it in verse at large; then again
contracted those verses to a smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
number, and better expression.
Many things are, as easilier, so
sooner, done severally, then at
once: as our strength, in parcels,
quickly takes up the weight, which
united in one it can never move.
For the mind travelling with many
conceptions at once (undisburdned
of any) must needs be much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55317:10"/>
retarded and confounded;
but she beholds them now much
more clearly and distinctly, when
thus by writing laid before her
face; by this she hath fewer busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
to attend at once, more
room to perfect, and ease to range
them, now not so easily skipping
and withdrawing themselves out of
her sight, or interturbing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as when they were all confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
floating in the fancy. * <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectus</hi>
(saith Sir <hi>Fr. Bacon) cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus

si literis mandentur. * Whosoever
hath his minde fraught with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thoughts, his wits and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

[by committing them to writing]
He tosseth his thoughts more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he marshalleth them more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
he seeth better how they look,
when they are turned into words;
finally he thus waxeth wiser than
himself.</hi> Though for some smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler

any one particular Argument too
far, and draw it out as it were to

one head, cannot be said well: but
if well, perchance, by some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant
wit; yet how much, upon
divers objects, will that wit say bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and by this advantage, go so
much beyond it self, as without it,
it doth beyond others? It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
therefore, often to break
off the thread you are spinning;
and set your imagination on work
afresh, upon some other new cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
as if nothing at all had
been meditated before. All which
variety of in-cohering matter is to
be joynted and set together in the

(and not before) use the help of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

find to have handled something
pertinent to it. For, if you exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
your own Meditation, after
you have read theirs, most-what,
the wit is not so active and loving
of trouble; but that, like other
bodies in motion, it will follow a
Track and Rote made before it,
rather, than its own Biass, and
Force; And as unlikely as it is,
before the seeing what others in
the first place have done, that your
inventions should coincidate with
theirs; so difficult it is, after, that
yours should vary from them. Be
wary therefore of accepting in the
first place the auxiliaries of your
Books or of your memory: which
(doing it without pains) is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ready with the tendering of
her provisions, though never so

upon all your Materials revised, a
Division, and distribution of them
under certain Heads, such as best
fits them, is alwayes to be cast, and
contrived; though not necessary
alwayes to be mentioned, yet in
many also not to be concealed.
Which Division as, by having the
several sorts of matter taken (as it
were) out of a confused heap, and
distinctly sorted by themselves, it
much cleareth the Discourse, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Auditors judgment, and
sheweth the Orators, so likewise

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55317:12"/>
guides the Oration steady from an
uncertain and unequal fluctuation
(like a weather-driven ship desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of her Pilot) and makes it
steer a certain and methodical
course to the Point, whither the
Orator designs it: By which also
the Oration is freed from tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>(Partitiotaedium levat,</hi> Quint. l.
4. c. 2.) Whilst the Auditors atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
more patiently passeththrough
many moderate discourses, than
one long: and it seemeth excessive
to him for one subject, which for
many, seems but short, and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
In which by the Orators
mentioning continually his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
from one part to another he
is refreshed to see, how much is
already finished, and the bounds
also of what is yet to come, (<hi>minus
longum videtur, in quo, quid ultimum
sit, certum est. Quint.</hi>) and proceeds
to a new subject with a more ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
attention. For the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
after a long discourse, Recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations
arenecessary, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor

            <p>2. Paucity of parts (not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily

a division: and as a partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

so that partition is better,
that doth not much recede from it.
(<hi>Neque prudentia auditoris confusione

            <p>It is but justice to exact of you; and perverseness it
is in you to deny, &amp;c. Your teachings we heard; we
read your writings.—Gross for men of this quality;
wise, and grave, men.—They thought it better, to be
somewhat hardly yoked at home, than for ever abroad
discredited.—the exercise of this kind of judgement
our Saviour required in the <hi>Jews,</hi> in them of <hi>Beraea,</hi>
the Scripture commendeth it.—wherein they which
did impose were holy, and they unrighteous, which did
bear the burden.—I need not give instance in any one
sentence so alledged, for that I think the instance in
any alledged otherwise a thing not easie to be given.—
They accuse you, and against you they plead—For one
kind as many reasons may be brought, as for another.—
Though in which we are, oftener, than they, mistaken.—
They will sell your bodies, your wives, &amp;c. all these
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55317:28"/>

these be the two fair supporters, &amp;c. either the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing

how gainful, how happy, it must needs be.—How shall
a man know to do himself this right, how to perform
this honorable duty.—None hath brought ceremony

            <p>For in a Civil State, more in-sight, and in those affairs
more experience, must needs be granted them.—Forced
to confess, that, with whom the truth is, they know
not.—That evil spirit, which is, even in his illusions
strong—As the simple sort are, even when they see no
apparent cause, jealous.—His vehement requests
herein, as touching both points, were satisfied.—Some
things are so plain, that truth, from falshood, is, most
easily discerned.—which thing though in it self most
ture, yet is, in your defence most weak.—Yea they are,
of their due and deserved sufferings, no less proud,
than &amp;c.—Be found, unto all kinds of knowledge, a
Step-mother.</p>
            <p>3. * Of placing the <hi>Accusative

To do as the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> did, the learned in
some other Churches must needs be more willing.—
somewhat needs ye must do—Dangerous it was, &amp;c.—

Wayes of peaceable conclusion there are but these two
certain—so that of peace and quietnesse there is not

            <p>5. * Of placing the <hi>oblique cases</hi>
with their <hi>signs</hi> or <hi>prepositions [of, to,

they commonly thrive better in

he infers his conclusion from
them; and, where the Discourse
is somewhat long, making a second
repetition of the premises [As in

from the constant course of the

to his <hi>Thesis</hi> or Conclusion.] The

confirm (and this as briefly, and as
immediately, as may be) what he
saith, by these <hi>Aetiologies,</hi> that he
may render the fabrick of his speech not onely beautiful, but
strong; to leave no dubitation in

to depart even from the right,
where they disallow it. (It was
<hi>Pomponius Secundus</hi> his saying

Ep. 17.) For none is an Orator to
himself, but others; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what is not writ agreeable to

themselves best determine? what
is writ for others, is either to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
or to delight them; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this kind profits much,
which doth not first please; and
what best pleaseth them, they best
judge. Therefore since a discreet
Orator would onely use what they
may like, it is also very requisite,
that he trie how they like what he
useth. Onely in this he is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
not singular opinions, but
some more general consent in their
judgement; which, when in many
the same, is seldom mistaken.</p>

Prose, but a perpetual change of the
feet? (the harmony of which, when
placed in such an order, being once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
made afterward a disposition of
them, a law for Verse) even the same
power these retain, * in the Orators
stile, as in verse, though it must needs
be more loose <hi>(non vacat exiguis)</hi> and
* in his <hi>pronunciation,</hi> as in a song;
though it must needs be less curious,
and affected.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now those words which the voice is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55317:64"/>
chiefly to stay upon, and give an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<hi>Emphasis</hi> to, are such, in which
there lies some figure, as all <hi>Antitheta's</hi>
and <hi>correspondents,</hi> and words relating
to another, and generally the <hi>mediums</hi>
(in which lies the greatest burden) of
our arguments. <hi>(Observandum quo loco

            <p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And amongst the rest alwayes the
cadence of the Period, which is most
observed, and accordingly by the voice
usually most varied, ought to be fitted
for a more tunable pronounciation <hi>(Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio

therefore the chiefest Orators, though
negligent of all the rest, have observed
certain measures and feet; <hi>placet
plerisque dichoraeus,</hi> saith <hi>Quintilian:</hi>
and <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>[esse videatur]</hi> is famous.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55317:65"/>
Yet this strictness extends not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
four or five of the last syllables.
A due and tunable clause therefore of
a Period after the last Pause that is
made before it (i. e. the Comma or
other Point that precedes &amp;c.) ought
to be ordinarily at least of four sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
because the voice begins its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
some Notes before the sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that concludes: (For who can
conclude handsomely that knowes
not of it, before he is enter'd into the
last word or syllable?) And these
syllables are better all <hi>long,</hi> than all
<hi>short<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> those having more stability and
weight; better <hi>long</hi> and <hi>short</hi> interchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geably,
than all <hi>long;</hi> the <hi>short</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
far more smooth and sweet, and
the voice also requiring by courses
some syllables, wherein to spare (as in
the <hi>short</hi>) and some again, wherein to
extend it self (as in the <hi>long.</hi>) By <hi>long,</hi>
I mean those whereon the <hi>emphasis</hi> of
the word resteth; and by <hi>short,</hi> those
which the voice usually toucheth more
lightly, as <hi>fa-</hi> in [<hi>favour</hi>] and <hi>-ward</hi>
in [<hi>reward</hi>] are to be accounted
long; <hi>-vour,</hi> and <hi>re-,</hi> short.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:55317:65"/>
And therefore in verse (wherein
there is more care of Euphony in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part) though the <hi>English</hi> doth not
strictly observe set quantities, yet
hath it a great latitude of roughness
or smoothness, according as these are
well placed; nor flowes it so grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
1. * unless ordinarily every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
syllable, or latter part of the
foot be <hi>long</hi> (especially the latter syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
of the first, and of the penultime,
foot). As this verse:</p>
            <p>[These in the Summer of thy favor grow]
<hi>runs better than this:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>In the Summer of thy favor these grow</hi>].
And note, that <hi>Iambicks</hi> are better
than <hi>Trochae's,</hi> and <hi>Spondae's</hi> than <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctyles.</hi>
As for terminations, those u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
<hi>short</hi> in the Latine (not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
position) are so in the <hi>English,</hi> as
the <hi>Liquids,</hi> &amp;c. And those again <hi>long,</hi>
which have <hi>long vowels, double conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi>
and endure a harder pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,
easily known to every ones
experience. And Secondly, * Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

               <hi>Monosyllables,</hi> harsh, and requiring, as
several words, some little pause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, conclude not so tunably.
<hi>(Monosyllaba, si plura sunt, malè conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuabuntur.</hi> Quint.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> As for the rest of our stile, 'tis suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
if the several clauses (any great
disparity of which sounds very harsh,
and unequal) be, as much as conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
may be, of a like and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
extension; and that, neither ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
short, nor very long; not under
four syllables ordinarily, nor exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ten, or twelve: for the voice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
vary under four, nor so tunably at
once pronounce above ten. Hence
five or six feet are the <hi>longest</hi> verse
usual in any Language; and two feet
the <hi>shortest.</hi> And by these metrical
members of Poetry (which were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
first used, because found more to
please; the Orators aim, as well as the
Poets) all our prose also is tacitely
modelled: though it must alwayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the appearance thereof, lest it
should seem to be more affected, less
natural, less masculine, by so much
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55317:66"/>
trimming; as also to be strict therein would
be too troublesome.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> That the voice may have its true compass,
both to notes higher and lower, as the
words and the passions do require, 'tis to be
placed in a middle key between both, to
rise and fall at pleasure. <hi>(Mediis inter acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

<hi>Base,</hi> how can it descend, or ascend, in a
<hi>Treble?</hi> As a singing tone, and a verse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
cadence are alwayes to be avoided, so
that composition and pronunciation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neerest them, is the best, and, that the
voice in speaking be rather elevated some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
than depressed; because we are more
prone, for our ease, or from our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
to a low tone; which yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too deep, and full, and less clear, and
making accordingly a weaker impression
upon the Auditor, is the worse, of the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes:
(<hi>Submisso illo murmure debilitatur

your pronouncing, Tardity is to be chosen,
rather than precipitancy, and a scanning as

all your syllables, rather than making per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<hi>Syneloepha's;</hi> and drowning that which
follows, by too much straining that which

ought to be distinct, and every syllable, to
