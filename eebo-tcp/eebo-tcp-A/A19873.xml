         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

he tooke vpon him, and

he made himselfe in case and

for the performing of it. All was to this end, that he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19855:3"/>
might restore the worke of God to his originall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
In the bringing of which to passe, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
by God in the beginning (as a thing necessarie)
that the head of the Serpent (by whose meanes it was
violated and defaced) should be brused. And <hi>For this
cause</hi> (saith Iohn)<note place="margin">1 Iohn. 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>appeared the Son of God, that he might
loose the workes of the Deuil:</hi> wherof this was the first.
For in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3 we read, that his first worke after his fal,
was enuiously to tempt our first parents, and thereby
to ouerthrow all man-kinde. And here, straight af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our Sauiour was baptized, hee with like enuy set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
on him. Christ therefore first beginneth with
the ouercomming of that: and for that purpose hee
is here led forth to be tempted, that so being tempted
he might ouercome.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour makes this question, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 7. vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their going out to see <hi>Iohn Baptist; what went yee
out to see?</hi> As if hee should haue said, They would
haue neuer gone out into the wildernesse, except it
had beene to see some great and worthy matter: and
behold a greater and a worthier matter heere. If
there be any thing in the wildernesse worthy the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out to behold, this is a matter much worthy of
it. Or if there be any matter worthy the hearing, it
is worthy our attention to heare; not <hi>Michael</hi> the
Archangell disputing about the body of <hi>Moses</hi> with
the deuill, <hi>Iude</hi> 9. but our owne matter, argued by
two such cunning aduersaries; to see the combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
our grand enemy, who goeth about like a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Lyon seeking to deuour vs,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 8.</note> and our Arch-duke:
for so he is called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. to see our King of old,
<hi>Psalm.</hi> 74. 12. the pawne of our inheritance, and our

craftinesse and subtilty of the old serpent, <hi>Reue.</hi> 12. 9.
to see the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apo. 5. 5.</note> combating
with the roaring Lyon, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. If any thing bee
worthy the sight, it is this.</p>
            <p>Though there should come no profit to vs by the
victory, yet were it worth the sight, in this respect,
only to behold how these Champions behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
that so we may bee warned before hand, by
seeing the strength of our Aduersary: and that also
seeing the manner of his fight, and of our Sauiours
defence, wee may be instructed how to arme our
selues, and how to ward accordingly. For let vs bee
sure, that since the Deuill spared not to tempt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
he will be much more bold with vs: If he haue
done this to the greene tree, what will become of
the drie? <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 31. If he haue sought our ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
in Christ, how much more will he doe it in
our selues? If our dayes here be but as the dayes of
an hireling, <hi>Iob</hi> 7. 1. and our whole life bee but as a

Here we may see the manner of his casting them,
that so Sathan should not circumuen vs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11.
Let vs marke how our Sauiour wardeth and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
himselfe, that so wee may be armed with the

the wildernesse to see it.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Then Iesus.</hi>] This is the description of the entrie
into the temptation, and it containeth (as a weighty
history) many circumstances importing great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19855:4"/>
which may be reduced to 7. branches or heads.
First, the two Champions, 1. Christ, and 2. Sathan:

the holy Ghost: 4. the end, which was the conflict

to it, that is, his fasting.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>1.</head>
               <p>First; for the partie defendant, Christ; who (as God)
giueth food to euery liuing creature, <hi>Psal.</hi> 136. 25. and
(as God and man) with fiue loaues and two fishes fed
5000. besides women and children, <hi>Math.</hi> 14. 11.
He that is said to be the very meat it selfe, whereby
we liue eternally, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. is here said to bee hungry.
He, before whom thousand thousands are said to
minister, and ten thousand thousands are said to stand
before him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 10. hath here for his companions
the wilde beasts: for so saith <hi>Marke</hi> Chap. 1. 13. He
to whom the Angels minister, verse 11. is here assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with deuils, which offer vnto him matter of great
indignity; and the indignity which hee suffered:
leads vs to the consideration of the greeuousnesse of
our sinnes, and of the greatnesse of his loue, both
which are measured by the greatnesse of those things
he suffered for vs; as that hee was cast out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the company of Angels (for so <hi>Marke chap.</hi> 1.
<hi>verse</hi> 12. hath it) into the Desert, to be a companion
of beasts, and so led forth to be tempted; where hee
suffered in his body hunger, in his soule temptation:
what is it else, but a proclayming of his great loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
vs? As if he should (exulting) say, What is it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19855:4"/>
that shall separate me from the loue of men? Shall
temptation? shall solitarinesse? shall hunger? shall
wearisome labour and trauell? shall watching? shall
anguish of minde, and bloody sweat? shall mockes?
shall whippes? shall nayles? shall speares? shall
principalities? That wee also might vse the same
challenge which <hi>Paul</hi> doth in the 8. Chapter of his
Epistle to the <hi>Romanes</hi> the 35. verse, <hi>What shall sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
vs from the loue of Christ? shall tribulation? shall
anguish? or persecution?</hi> These two profitable points
grow out of the consideration of the person of the
defendant.</p>

               <p>Secondly, the party assay lant is the Deuill, who is
so called, by reason of his foule mouth in defaming:
for so doth the word <hi>Diabolus</hi> import, whereby we
haue occasion to detest the sinne of infamy: and it
sheweth what name they deserue, and how to bee
estemed of, in whom that quality is found. S. <hi>Paul,
2 Tim.</hi> 3. 3. foretold, that in the latter daies there
should be men deuils, foule-mouthed men, euill spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers:
and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 11 he speaketh of women deuils,
because of their calumnious speeches. In the tongue
wherein Christ spake these words, namely, the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacke,
the fittest word that he could finde to signifie
the deuils name, is a word that signifieth <hi>Diuulgator:</hi>
so that a publisher of infamous reports, is good Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacke
for the deuill; as when a man lightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues
a reproach, either forging it himselfe by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construction,
or credulously receiuing it vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of others, and then is not sorry for his brothers
ill, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 22. but rather insulteth; not considering
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19855:5"/>
that he himselfe may fall into the like temptations,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. and so becomes puffed vp, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. and at
last; fals a blazing his brothers imperfections, 3. <hi>Iohn</hi>
10. These come right to the deuils qualitie, they take
vpon them the abetting of the deuils quarrell.</p>
               <p>It is the Deuils occupation to defame vs first with
God, as he did <hi>Iob,</hi> as if he had beene an hypocrite,
and had serued God onely for gaine, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 9. and so
stands he continually accusing vs, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. 10. and
he also defameth God with vs, as if hee were a God
that did enuy our good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. and so he here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fameth
God to Christ, as if he were carelesse in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding
for him, in suffering him to be hungry. And
from these two defamations proceeds all euill what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer,
aswell that which the Diuines call <hi>Malum
poenae,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 12. accusing <hi>Iob,</hi> that he would curse
God if he handled him roughly, and so got power
ouer his goods: as that which they call <hi>Malum cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae.</hi>
For his defaming God with vs, was the cause of
all sinne: and euery where still we see he laboureth
to perswade vs, that God is an vnkinde God; that so
we may burst forth into those termes, <hi>This good did
I get at Gods hand, 2 King.</hi> 6. 33. to wit, <hi>hunger.</hi> To
this doth he tempt Christ, <hi>verse</hi> 3. And as to despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
so sometimes to the contrary, presumption; as
<hi>verse 6. Cast thy selfe downe, &amp;c.</hi> by bringing vs to
haue a base conceit of God, defaming him as if he
were a God of clouts, not to be reckoned of, as if he
were a man to wait vpon vs, and to take vs vp as oft
as we list to throw our selues downe, that we may
say in our hearts, as they that were frozen in their

vs (as <hi>verse</hi> 9.) that he will giue vs all this, if we will
fall downe and worship him, as though he were very
liberall in rewards, and as though God were vnkinde
or vngratefull, not once regarding vs for all our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
but suffer<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

men to that passe, as to say, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14. that <hi>It is but in
vaine to serue God, what gaine is in his seruice?</hi> If he
cannot preuaile this way against vs, then he will try
another way: for, when (seeing that this temptation
succeeded not) the deuill left Christ, he departed not
for altogether, but went to come againe (as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in <hi>Luke 4. 13. he departed for a time.</hi>) Christ was
too cunning for him in disputing; he meant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to take another course: for as <hi>Iames</hi> noteth,
Chap. 1. verse 14. there be two sorts of temptations,
one by inticement, as a Serpent; another by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
as a Lyon: if he cannot preuaile as a Serpent,
he will play the Lyon. He had also another houre at
Christ in the Garden, the houre of darknesse, <hi>Luke</hi>
22. 53. there he brused his heele.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, we are to consider the leader, <hi>He was led
by the Spirit.</hi> In which we are to note fiue things: not
making any question, but that it was the good Spirit,
for so it appeareth in <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 1.</p>
               <p>First, that the state of a man regenerate by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
is not a standing still, <hi>Math. 20. 6. He found
others standing idle in the market place, and he said to
them, why stand ye idle all day?</hi> We must not onely
haue a mortifying and reuiuing, but a quickning and
stirring spirit. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. which will moue vs, and
cause vs to proceed: we must not lie still like lumpes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19855:6"/>
of flesh, laying all vpon Christs shoulders, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3, 16.
We must walke for wards, for the kingdom of God
consists not in words, but in power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as there must be a stirring, so this stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
must not bee such, as when a man is left to his
owne voluntarie or naturall motion: we must go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as we are lead. For hauing giuen our selues
to God, we are no longer to be at our owne disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or direction: whereas before our calling, wee
were Gentiles, and were carried into errors, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12, 2. wee wandred vp and downe as masterlesse or
carelesse, or else gaue heed to the doctrine of diuels,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1 4. or else led with diuers lustes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 6.
But now being becom the children of God, we must
be led by the Spirit of God: <hi>For so many as bee the
sonnes of God, are led thereby, Rom.</hi> 8, 14. We must not
be ledde by the Spirit whence the Reuelation came,
<hi>Math.</hi> 16, 22. from whence reuelations of flesh and
blood do arise; but by the Spirit from whence the
voice came, <hi>This is my beloued sonne, in whom I am wel
pleased.</hi> It came not by the spirit that ministreth wise
counsel, but by that which came downe vpon them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the manner of leading, is described to be
such a kinde of leading, as when a Ship is losed from
the shore, as <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 22. it is called launching forth:
so in the 18. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the 31. verse, <hi>Paul</hi> is saide to
haue failed foorth. The holy Ghost driuing vs, is
compared to a gale of winde, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 8. which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vs, that as when the winde blow<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>th, we must be
ready to hoist vp saile: so must we make vs ready to
be led by the Spirit. Our Hop<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> is compared to an
Anchor, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6, 19. which must be h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>led vp to vs;
and our Faith to the Saile, we are to beare as great a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19855:6"/>
saile as we can. We must also looke to the closenesse
of the vessell; which is our Conscience: for, if wee
haue not a good conscience, we may make shipwrack
of faith, religion, and all, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 19. And thus are
we to proceed in our journey towards our countrey
(the spirituall <hi>Ierusalem)</hi> as it were sea-faring men.
Acts 20, 22. <hi>Now behold, I go bound in spirit to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi>
to which iourny the loue of Christ must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
vs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 14.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that he was ledde to be tempted. His
temptation therefore came not by chance; nor as <hi>Iob</hi>
speaketh, chap. 5. v. 6. out of <hi>the dust,</hi> or out of <hi>the
earth,</hi> nor from <hi>the deuill,</hi> not onely ouer <hi>Iobs</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
but not so much as ouer his goods, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 12, 14.
He had no power of himselfe, no not so much as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Hogs of the <hi>Gergashites,</hi> who were prophane
men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8, 31. Hence gather we this comfort, that
the holy Ghost is not a stander by (as a straunger)
when we are tempted, <hi>Tanquam otiosus spectator;</hi> but
he leades vs by the hand, and stands by as a faithfull
Assistant, <hi>Esay</hi> 4, 13. He makes an issue out of all our
temptations, and <hi>will not suffer vs to bee tempted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
our strength, 2 Cor.</hi> 10, 13. And, he turneth the
worke of sione, and of the diuel too, vnto our good,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 28. so that all these shall make vs more warie
after to resist them: and hell (by fearing it) shalbe an
occasion vnto vs, to auoid that might bring vs to it;
and so they shall all be fellow-helpers to our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So that temptations, whether they bee (as the
Fathers call them) rods to chasten vs for sinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
or to try and sift vs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3, 12. and so to take
away the chaffe, the fanne being in the holy Ghosts
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19855:7"/>
hand: or whither they bee sent to buffet vs against
the pricke of the flesh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 17. Or whither they
be as matters seruing for our experience, not onely
for our selues, that we may know our own strength,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 3. and to worke patience in vs: but to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
also, that so his mouth may be stopped, as in <hi>Iob
2, 3. Hast thou marked my seruant Iob, how upright he is,
and that in all the world there is not such an one?</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they be, the deuill hath not the rod or chaine
in his hands, but the holy Ghost to order them, as
they may best serue for his glory and our good: and
as for the deuill, he bindeth him fast, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 20, 2.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, by the Greeke word here vsed, is set forth
the difference between the temptations of the Saints,
and Reprobates. In the Lords Prayer one petition is,
<hi>Lead vs not into temptation:</hi> but there, the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
another manner of leading, than is heere
meant. We do not there pray against this manner
of leading here, which is so to leade vs, as to be with
vs, and to bring vs backe againe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13, 20. but we
pray there, that hee would not cast or driue vs into
temptations; and when we are there, leaue vs, by
withdrawing his grace and holy Spirit, as hee doth
from the reprobate and forsaken.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
               <head>IIII.</head>
               <p>The fourth point is the end, that is, the Conflict,
as it concerneth Christ; insomuch, that he was <hi>led</hi>
to be tempted. In which temptation, <hi>Augustine</hi> saith,
<hi>Habemus &amp; quod credentes veneremur, et quod viden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
imitamur:</hi> There be two things for faith to adore,
and two things for imitation to practise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:19855:7"/>First for faith, that the temptations of Christ, haue
sanctified temptations vnto vs: that whereas before
they were curses, like vnto hanging on a tree; now
since Christ hath beene both tempted and hanged
on a tree, they bee no longer signes and pledges of
Gods wrath, but fauours. A man may be the childe
of God notwithstanding, and therefore hee is not to
receiue any discouragement by any of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, besides the sanctifying, it is an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so that now when we are tempted, they haue
not the force they had before: for now the Serpents
head is brused, so that hee is now nothing so strong
(as he was) to cast his darts. Also the head of his
darts are blunted, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 55. Death, where is thy
sting? Hell, where is thy victory?</hi> For as his death and
resurrection had a mortifying force against the <hi>old
man,</hi> and a quickning force toward the <hi>new man:</hi> so
hath his temptation a dulling force to the Deuill, and
a strengthning force to vs.</p>
               <p>For our life and imitation, there are also two.
First, <hi>Compassion:</hi> for Christ knowing in what sort
we were tempted, as hauing felt by experience, both
how strong the assaylant was, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 13. who,
thrust sore at him that he might fall; and how fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our nature is to make resistance, being nothing
but dust, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 14. he is moued thereby to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
seuerity, and to put on the bowels of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
So that, <hi>Now we haue not a high Priest which
cannot be tempted with our infirmities, but was tempted
in like sort. Heb.</hi> 4. 15. So we, (which were before
stonie Iudges, and too rough for Physitians) ought in
like sort (hauing beene tempted our selues) to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19855:8"/>
looke vpon others defects with a more passionate
regard.</p>
               <p>The second thing we are to imitate, Christ is our
<hi>fellow-helper</hi> in all our necessities and temptations;
who, as he sheweth vs his sleights and darts, <hi>Ephe.</hi>
4. 14. so he teacheth vs how to auoyd them. This is
no small comfort to vs, when we consider, that <hi>he is
with vs,</hi> and will be, <hi>till the end of the world, Math.</hi>
28. 20. who hath <hi>ouercome the world, Iohn</hi> 16. 33. and
<hi>the deuill:</hi> if any temptation happen, that hee will
beare vs out, we may be of good cheere. This was it
that did so animate <hi>Iob, Doe thou but take my part,
and who shall touch me? Iob</hi> 17. 3. When as both
Christ and wee draw together in one yoke, <hi>Math.</hi>
11. 29. what can hurt vs? Yet if wee be affraid for
that we see the enemy comming; let vs call for the
helpe of our assistant, &amp; as it is said in <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 1. we
shall see <hi>God will arise, and his enemies shall be scattered:
they shall vanish like smoke, and melt like waxe.</hi> When
they are ready to attache vs, let vs say, <hi>Saue me O God,
for the waters are entred euen into my soule, Psal.</hi> 69. 1.
When we are feeble, then let vs say with <hi>Ezekiel, O
Lord it hath oppressed me, comfort me, Ezek.</hi> 38. 14. Or
though they haue wounded vs, let vs say with <hi>Dauid,
Bring out thy speare, and stop the way against them that
persecute me. Psal. 35. 3. Say yet to my soule, I am thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi>
So that we haue not onely an <hi>example,</hi> but a
<hi>comfort</hi> too.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="section">
               <head>V.</head>
               <p>The fift point, is the day and time when this was
done, in which wee are to note, two things. The
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19855:8"/>
word <hi>[Then]</hi> relateth as well to the end of the
Chapter next going before, as to the present instant.</p>
               <p>First then, when as Christ was but newly come
out of the water of Baptisme, and immediately after
the heauens had opened vnto him, and the holy
Ghost descended vpon him in the likenesse of a
Doue, and while he was yet full of the holy Ghost;
did the Deuill set vpon him. When as the voyce
from heauen had pronounced, <hi>This is my beloued
Sonne, in whom I am well pleased;</hi> the deuill straight
addeth; In whom I am ill pleased: and so addresseth
himselfe against him. And it is Gods property to
looke for much at his hands, to whom he hath giuen
much. When he giues a man a large measure of grace,
hee giues the deuill withall a large patent. Our
Sauiour had great guifts, and the deuill is like a
theefe, that will venter most for the greatest bootie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in regard of the present, we are to note,
that in thirty yeeres, the deuill did nothing to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour:
but now when he goes about to gird himselfe
with our saluation, according to <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 3. then doth
the deuill gird on his sword also; that is as much to
say, as the better the worke is, the more resistance it
shall haue. Ten repulses did the <hi>Israelites</hi> suffer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could get possession of the promised Land
of <hi>Canaan:</hi> and as many did <hi>Dauid</hi> endure, before
he was inuested in the promised Kingdome. Many
lets came before the Temple was re-edified, as is to
be seene in <hi>Esdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemias.</hi> Yea, (saith the
deuill:) Hath God <hi>annoynted him with the oyle of
gladnesse aboue his fellowes?</hi> I will see if I can annoynt
him with the oyle of sadnesse aboue his fellowes.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19855:9"/>
Hath he beene <hi>baptized of water and the holy Ghost?</hi>
I will prouide another Baptisme for him, namely, of
fire. Hath God <hi>sent downe the holy Ghost vpon him in
likenesse of a Doue?</hi> I will cause tribulation, and a
crowne of thornes to light vpon his head. Hath a
voyce come downe from Heauen saying, <hi>This is my
beloued Sonne?</hi> I will prouide a voyce for him, that
shall ascend from the foote, that shall say, <hi>If thou be
the Sonne of God, come downe from the Crosse.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
               <head>VI.</head>
               <p>The sixt is the place, the Lystes, to wit; the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
that so he might be alone, and that there
might be no fellow-worker with him in the matter
of our saluation, that he alone might haue the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the wine-presse, <hi>Esay</hi> 63, 3. So, in the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration
in the Mount, he was found alone, <hi>Luke</hi>
9, 36. So in the garden in his great agonie, he was in
effect alone; for his Disciples slept all the while,
<hi>Math.</hi> 26, 40. that vnto him might be ascribed all the
praise.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we will note here, that there is no place
priuiledged from temptations. As there be some that
thinke there be certaine places to bee exempt from
Gods presence, (as was noted in the dreame of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob:)</hi>
so the Monkes and Hermites thought, that by
auoyding company, they should be free from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
which is not so. For, although Christ were
alone in the wildernesse, and fasting too, yet was he
tempted we see. And yet it is true, that he that will
liue well, must shunne the company of the wicked,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 19, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:19855:9"/>When the Angels had brought <hi>Lot</hi> and his family
out of the doores, they charged them not to tarry,
nor to stand still, nor once to looke backe. So after
the Cocke had crowed, and put <hi>Peter</hi> in minde of
his fall; he <hi>went out of the doores and weps bitterly,
Math.</hi> 26, 75. his solitarinesse was a cause to make his
repentance the more earnest, and helped to increase
his teares: and company is commonly a hindrance
to the receiuing of any good grace, and to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
and confirming vs in any good purpose. But
as true it is, that temptations are, and may as well bee
in the deserts, as in publike places: not onely in the
valleyes, but in the mountaines, <hi>verse</hi> 8 and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the countrey, but euen in the holy Citie, <hi>verse</hi> 5.
yea, and sometimes full, and sometimes fasting, yea,
in Paradise and in Heauen it selfe; for thither doth
the deuill come and accuse vs before God: we are
therefore alwayes to stand vpon our guard. For in
<hi>Luke</hi> 11, 24. he is said, to <hi>walke through drie places,</hi>
least happily some might bee escaped from him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and though we could goe whether hee could
not come, we should not be free: for we carry euer a
<hi>Tempter</hi> about with vs. And when we pray to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
from temptation, it is not onely from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil,
but from our selues: we carry fire within vs. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi>
and <hi>Basil</hi> were of that minde once, that by
change of the place a man might goe from temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but afterward they recanted it, affirming; That
it was impossible to auoyd temptation, yea, though
he went out of the world, except he left his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
him also.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW come we to the seuenth
and last circumstance. It may
seeme strange, that being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to present himselfe to
the world, as <hi>Prince, Priest,</hi>
and <hi>Prophet,</hi> that hee would
make his progresse into the
Wildernesse, and begin with
a Fast: for this was cleane contrary to the course and
fashion of the world, which vseth when any great
matter is in hand, to make a <hi>Praeface</hi> or <hi>Praeludium</hi>
with some great solemnity. As when <hi>Salomon</hi> came
first to his Crowne, he went to the chiefe Citie, and
gathered a solemne Conuent. So Christ, should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
first haue gone to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the holy City, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19855:11"/>
there should haue bene some solemne banquet. But
Christ from his Baptisme began his calling, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
fortie dayes and forty nights. This his Fast (by
late Writers) is called the entrance into his calling:
by the ancient Writers, it is called the entrance into
his conflict.</p>
            <p>The manner of the Church hath alwayes beene,
that at the first institution or vndertaking of any
great and weighty matter, there hath beene extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Fasting. So <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 9, 9. when hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into his calling at the receiuing of the Law, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
forty dayes. So <hi>Elias, 1 Kings</hi> 19, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>8. at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
of the same Law, did the like. And so when
they went about the re-edifying of the Temple, as
appeareth <hi>Esdras</hi> 8, 49. So in the new Testament, at
the separation of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 13, 3. And
(as <hi>Ierome</hi> reporteth,) Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> would not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to write the diuine worke of his Gospell, vntill
the whole Church (by Fasting) had recommended
the same vnto God.</p>
            <p>So likewise, at the entrance into a Conflict, for the
obtaining of some Victory, as <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> did when
he ouercame the <hi>Amorites, 2 Chron.</hi> 20, 3. So did <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
when shee went about the deliuerance of the
Iewes, as in <hi>Ester</hi> 4, ver. 16. And <hi>Eusebius</hi> reporteth,
that when <hi>Peter</hi> was to enter disputation with <hi>Simon
Magus,</hi> there was Fasting throughout the whole
Church generally. Whether at the entrance into a
Calling, or to resist the diuell, Saint <hi>Peters</hi> rule men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in his first chapter and fifth verse, ought to
take place, we must <hi>vse Prayer and Fasting.</hi> And as at
all times we are to vse watchfulnesse &amp; carefulnesse:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19855:11"/>
so then especially, when we looke that the diuell wil
be most busie; and the rather, for that in some cases
there is no dealing without Fasting, as <hi>Marke</hi> 9, 29.
there is a kinde of diuell that will not bee cast out,
without <hi>Prayer and Fasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the number of daies wherein he fasted, iust
forty; Curiosity may finde it selfe worke enough:
but it is dangerous to make Conclusions, when no
certainty appeareth. Some say, there is a correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie
betweene these forty dayes, and the fortie
dayes wherein the world was destroyed by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.
But it is better to say, As <hi>Moses</hi> fasted fortie
dayes at the institution of the Law, and <hi>Elias</hi> fortie
at the restauration; so Christ heere. And because
he came but in the shape of a seruant, he would not
take vpon him aboue his fellow seruants. Contrary
to our times, wherein a man is accounted no bodie,
except he can haue a quirke aboue his fellowes. But
it is more materiall, to see how it concerneth vs. It
is a thing rather to be adored by admiration, than to
be followed by apish imitation.</p>
            <p>This Fast heere, was not the fast of a day, as that
of <hi>Peter</hi> and of <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10, 9, 30. but such as
<hi>Luke</hi> 4, 2. describeth, <hi>He did eate nothing all that time.</hi>
Saint <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> though his life were very strict
did eate Locusts and wilde Hony, <hi>Math.</hi> 3, 4. Ours is
not properly a Fast, but a prouocation of meats; and
therfore there can be no proportion between them.
But as it is, what is to be thought of it? <hi>Socrates</hi> and
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> record, that at the first, the Church did vse
to celebrate but one day in remembrance of Christs
Fast; till after, the <hi>Montanists</hi> (a certaine sect of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19855:12"/>
who thereupon are called <hi>Eueratitiae)</hi> raised it
to foureteene dayes; the zeale of the Cleargy after
increased it to forty, after to fifty: the Monkes
brought it to sixty, the Friars to seuenty; and if the
Pope had not there staid it, they would haue brought
it to eighty, and so haue doubled Christs fasting.
When the Primitiue Church saw the Heretickes
(by this outward shew) goe about to disgrace the
Christians, by this counterfeit shew of holinesse;
they vsed it also: but (saith <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome)</hi>
they held it onely a positiue law, which was in
the Church to vse or take away, and not as any exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of godlinesse.</p>
            <p>Onely a doubt resteth now, because of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of mens hearts, whether it were better left or
kept Some would haue abstinence vsed, and one day
kept for the Sabbath, but left to euery mans liberty
what time and day, and tied to no certainty: but that
were (vpon the matter) to haue none kept at all Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
the reformed Church (as that of
<hi>France)</hi> haue vsed their liberty in remouing of it, for
that they saw an inclination in their people to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
who would thinke themselues holier for such
fasting; like the Pharisies, <hi>Luke</hi> 18, 12. The Church
wherein we liue, vseth her liberty in retayning it, and
that vpon good reasons: for sith God hath created
the fishes of the sea for man, and giuen him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in them also, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9, 2. as well as in the beasts.
Sith the death of fish was a plague wherewith God
plagued <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and so contrariwise the encrease of
fish is a blessing: God will haue fish to be vsed, so that
he may haue praises as well for the sea, as for the
land. <hi>Psal.</hi> 104, 25.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:19855:12"/>If wee looke into the ciuill reason, wee shall see
great cause to obserue it. See <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 22. the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of flesh that was consumed in one moneth.
The maintenance of store then is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and therefore order must be taken according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> had fish dayes, that <hi>Tyrus</hi> and such
like, liuing vpon Nauigation, might haue vtterance
for their commodities, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13, 16. (for <hi>Tyrus</hi>
was the maritine Citie, till after <hi>Alexander</hi> annexed
to it another Citie, and made it drie.)</p>
            <p>The Tribe of <hi>Zabulon</hi> liued by Nauigation, <hi>Gen.</hi>
49, 13. which is a thing necessary both for wealth,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9, 20. and made <hi>Salomon</hi> richer than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
King, and also for munition, as <hi>Esay</hi> 23, 4. that
Tribe therefore had neede of maintenance. And
therefore our Church and Common-wealth haue
taken order accordingly; and the rather, for that
ourtimes require it: (for the times that forbad mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and the abstinence of meates, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4, 3. are
past) we rather liue in the age of selfe-loue, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy,
and filthy pleasure, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 4. There is more
feare of a pottinger full of gluttony, than a spoone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of superstition. This is no Fast, but a change of
meat.</p>

               <head>Verse 3. Then came to him the tempter, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>BEfore wee come to the particular temptations,
we haue foure generall points to be considered.
First, the changing of the deuils name, from <hi>deuill</hi>
to <hi>Tempter:</hi> secondly, that it is said, <hi>He came vnto
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19855:13"/>
him:</hi> thirdly, that hee came when he was fasting:
fourthly, the diuersitie and order of the temptatious.</p>
               <div n="1" type="subsection">
                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>First, in <hi>Iames</hi> 1, 13. it is said, that <hi>God tempteth no
man;</hi> and yet in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13, 3. it appeareth, that <hi>God doth
tempt some;</hi> we must then make difference betweene
temptations; betweene Gods temptations, and the
deuils. The deuill indeed tempteth vs, but God (as
our English translation hath it) trieth vs. The latter is
to commend vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, 5. or rather that our tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may bring forth patience, and patience hope,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 3. It makes vs know that to be in our selues,
which before we knew not, as we see in <hi>Iob.</hi> So the
Lord proued the <hi>Israelites,</hi> to see if they loued him
or no, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13, 3. The deuils temptation is to know
our corruption: for knowing the innocencie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
he went about to corrupt him. It is like the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
prouing of <hi>Manna,</hi> to try conclusions. Gods is
like the triall of gold, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 7. which the oftner it is
tried, the puter it waxeth: the deuils, like that of
<hi>Manna,</hi> which stinketh and corrupteth by triall.
Gods is like the triall of the fanne, <hi>Math.</hi> 3, 12. the
deuils like that of the sciue, <hi>Luke</hi> 22, 31. which lets
go the flower, and keeps the bran.</p>

                  <head>II.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, the deuill hath two shapes; in the one,
he tempteth and allureth, (and in that he came now
to our Sauiour:) in the other, he assayleth vs. that is,
by assault and violence, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6, 11. The first is the
temptation of hypocrites, <hi>Math.</hi> 22, 18. <hi>Shall we pay
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19855:13"/>
tribute to Caesar?</hi> The second, of <hi>Iudas,</hi> who in the
garden assaulted our Sauiour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6, 70. So Sathan
sets on Christ by violence. He came vnto Christ by
casting sparkes of fire into him; for he was deuoid
of any wicked and vaine thoughts comming forth
of him.</p>
                  <p>Two wayes may a man bee tempted: either by
doubts arising in our hearts out of vs, <hi>Luke</hi> 24, 38. or
by a sop entring into vs, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13, 27. Christ could
not be tempted the first way: for he was deuoid of
any wicked and vaine thought, comming forth of
him. To vs the deuill needs bring but a paire of bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
for he shall finde fire within vs: but to Christ
he was faine to bring fire too.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="subsection">
                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee then came to him when he was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
which discouereth the deuils desparate bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as also his craftinesse, in that hee waited his
time, to stay till hee was hungry. Notwithstanding,
Christ was newly come from his Baptisme, and was
full of the holy Ghost, and euen now in his exercise
of mortification, yet had the deuill courage to set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. There is no place so holy, nor exercise so
good, as can represse his courage, or giue a stay to the
boldnesse of his attempts: as wee see, <hi>Marke</hi> 4, 14. The
word is no sooner sowen, but Sathan comes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
and takes it out of their hearts: which must
needs be done in the Church. For the word is out
before they be out of the Church: so that hee is not
affraid of hearing the word, but can abide it well
enough, yea, better than many. And though they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19855:14"/>
carry the word out of the Church, he will waite on
then home, and choake the word with cares and
riches, and voluptuons li<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ing, like the seede that fell
among thornes, <hi>Luke</hi> 8, 14.</p>
                  <p>And no more doth he care for the exercise of
prayer: for euen then immediately after the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of forgiuenesse, when we haue made euen with
all the world, when God hath forgiuen vs, and wee
others; then doth the deuill giue vs occasion to say,
<hi>Lead vs not into temptation,</hi> as standing by there ready
to tempt vs.</p>
                  <p>And as little cares he for the Sacraments: for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after they had receiued the Sacrament, and
sang the hymne, Christ tels them, they <hi>shall all be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
in him that night, Math.</hi> 26, 1. Thus we see his
courage serues him at all times, nothing is able to
quaile it.</p>
                  <p>As this ought not to discourage the children of
God, hauing so faithfull an assistant to take their part:
so it giueth them this caueat, that they bee at no
time secure, but alwayes to keepe a sure guard. Saint
<hi>Bernard</hi> in the middest of a Sermon was solicited to
vaine-glory, because he thought he pleased his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
and thereupon brake off his speech, and turned
it to the deuill, saying; <hi>Non propter te hoc opus coep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est;
nec propter te, nec in te finitur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as he is couragious, so is he subtile: for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his eager desire, he staid the fittest time,
wherein consisteth a chiefe point of wisedome. So
when he tempted <hi>Eue,</hi> he staied till her husband was
away, and till he could shew her the fruit which was
so pleasing to the eye. So when <hi>Dauid</hi> lay with <hi>Beth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19855:14"/>
sheba Vriahs</hi> wife, he tempted him in the euening and
after his sl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>epe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11, 12. a very fit time for the
purpose. So when they were asleepe, the enemy
sowed tar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>s, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>And as he is warie in choosing his time, so is he
as cunning in chusing the meanes, obseruing the
dispositions of men. For wanton and voluptuous
men, he hath the daughters of <hi>Moab,</hi> a bayte fit for
their humors, whereby to tempt them to idolatrie,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 15, 1. For men secure and carelesse, he hath a
net that sufficeth to throw ouer them, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 26.)
and snare them in. For others, that haue more care to
seeke and inquire into things, he hath quils to blow
them vp, as <hi>knowledge which puffes vp, 1 Cor.</hi> 8, 1. Yea,
euen the best things can hee make serue for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and to be occasions of temptations; so that he
may finde better entertainment, for the good exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
sake that come with him. He will come some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
shrowded in the necessitie of nature, as here;
for when a man is hungry, nature requireth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to asswage it.</p>
                  <p>Prayer, no man doubteth to be a godly exercise:
yet thereby he tempted them that loued to pray in
the Synagogues, &amp; make much babling, and repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Math.</hi> 6, 5, 7. In like sort doth he abuse the name
of good counsell, as in <hi>Peter</hi> to Christ, <hi>Math.</hi> 16, 22.
who (as a friend) wished him to spare hims<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

liue out his time.</p>
                  <p>Thus can he put on a faire shew, the sooner to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile:
and for good reason, for if he should come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked
in his owne likenesse, he would be rejected;
as if <hi>Iehoram</hi> the King of <hi>Israel</hi> had come himselfe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19855:15"/>
without <hi>Iehoshaphat, Elisha</hi> would not haue looked
on him: so by a good pretence, the temptation
shrowdes and insinuates it selfe: otherwise, it would
not be looked on.</p>

               <div n="4" type="subsection">
                  <head>IIII.</head>
                  <p>Now wee are to consider the diuersity and order
of the temptations, and then will we handle them
particularly. And first we are to note, that though
there are but these three recorded, yet he endured di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
others. His whole life was full of temptations,
as may appeare by <hi>Luke</hi> 22, 28. It is said, <hi>Luke</hi> 4, 2.
that he was tempted forty dayes of the diuel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
these three temptations heere set downe, were not
till after the end of forty daies. These only are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
but there were other not written, as diuers of
his miracles are vnwritten, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20, 25. Only, <hi>so much
was written as was expedient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These three are a briefe Abridgement of all his
Temptations. As it is true that <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>Christ
resembled Adam, and was made a quickening spirit, as
Adam was a liuing soule, 1 Cor.</hi> 15, 45. And the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of Egypt, by being
called out of Egypt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2, 15. So may Christ and
<hi>Adam</hi> be compared in these three temptations. For
they both were tempted with concupiscence of the
flesh, concupiscence of the eye, and pride of life, 1.
<hi>Iohn,</hi> 2, 16. In <hi>Adam</hi> the diuell first brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a conceit, that God enuied his good. As we see
Faulconers put hoodes ouer Hawkes eyes, to make
them more quiet and ruely. Secondly, he lulles him
on to a proud conceit of himself, by perswading him
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19855:15"/>
that by <hi>eating</hi> he should <hi>be like God.</hi> Thirdly, hee
sheweth the fruit, which was pleasant. So in Christs
temptation. First, hee would haue brought him to
murmure against God: secondly, to presume: and
thirdly, to commit Idolatry, all which are set downe
in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 5, 6, 7 verses. And vnder these three
heads come all temptations, <hi>Numb. 14 &amp;</hi> 21. &amp; <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus</hi>
32.</p>
                  <p>To some of these extreames will the diuell seek to
driue one. First, by distrust he will seeke to driue vs
to vse vnlawfull meanes, for the obtaining of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
things, as bread is when a man is hungry. Or if
we be in no such want, that that temptation cannot
take place, then (through superfluity) hee will tempt
vs to wanton and vnnecessary desires, as to throw our
selues downe, that the Angels may take vs vp: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
preuailed so farre, then he carrieth vs to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
and all. <hi>All this will I giue thee;</hi> there is his <hi>[All:]
Fall downe and worship me,</hi> there is the diuell with it:
so (that in this respect) may it well be saide, that <hi>The
way of a Serpent is ouer a stone, Prou.</hi> 30, 19. He goeth so
slily, that a man seeth him in, before he can tell what
way, or how he got in. First, he wraps himselfe in
necessity, and thereby windes himselfe in vnpercey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
then he brings vs to make riches our God.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs see his Darts. The first is, of making
stones bread: This may well be called, <hi>The hungrie
Temptation.</hi> The streame of the Doctors, make <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
offence the sinne of Gluttony: but <hi>Bucer</hi> thinks,
that this temptation is rather to bee referred to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
and dispaire. There is small likelyhoode, that
one should sinne in gluttony by eating bread onely.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19855:16"/>
The diuels desire was onely, that the stones might be
turned into bread, and that after so long a Fast: and
then, if the Temptation had beene to Gluttony,
Christs answer had bene nothing to the purpose; the
Deuill might well haue replyed against the insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
of it. For gluttony is to be answered by a text
willing sobriety: whereas this text which Christ
answereth by, containeth rather an assertion of Gods
prouidence: and therefore our Sauiour should haue
seemed very vnskilfull in defending himselfe. The
temptation therefore is to distrust.</p>
                  <p>This standeth well with the deuils cunning in
fight: for by this he shooteth first euen at the throat,
and at that which is the life of a Christian, to wit, his
faith; as a man would say, <hi>Iugulum petit,</hi> euen at that
which ouercometh the world, 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5, 5. He tempted
him to such a distrust, as was in the <hi>Israelites, Exod.</hi>
17, 7. when they asked if God were with them, or no?
So he made <hi>Adam</hi> thinke, God eared not for him: so
here the deuill premiseth a doubt to shake his faith,
wherein Christ made no doubt, <hi>Si filius Dei es.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed you heard a voyce say, you were the <hi>belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
Sonne of God,</hi> but are you so indeed? or was it
not rather a delusion? You see you are almost star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for want of bread: well, would God haue suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
you so to be, if you had beene his <hi>Filius dilectus?</hi>
No, you are some hunger-starued child. So <hi>Luke</hi> 22,
31. Christ prayed, that <hi>Peters faith might not faile.</hi> It
was that the deuil shot at. He is <hi>a roaring Lyon seeking
to deuour vs,</hi> whom we must resist by faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5, 8.</p>
                  <p>It is our faith that the aimes at, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3, 5. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ouerthrowne that, disobedience soone will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19855:16"/>
Hauing abolished the stablisher of the Law,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3, 31. the <hi>breach of the Law</hi> must needs follow.
He hath then fit time to set vs a worke, about making
stones into bread, that is, to get our liuing by vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means. First, shipwracke of faith, then of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>The Deuill here seeing him in great want and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
would thereby bring in doubt, that hee was not
the Sonne of God, which is not a good argument.
For whether we respect the naturall tokens of Gods
fauour, we see they happen not to the wisest and
men of best and greatest knowledge, as appeareth in
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 9, 11. or the supernaturall fauour of God.
We shall see <hi>Abraham</hi> forced to flye his Countrey
into <hi>Egypt</hi> for famine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10, 12. So did <hi>Isaac, Gen.</hi>
26, 1. and <hi>Iacob</hi> likewise was in the same distresse,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 43, 1. Notwithstanding that God was called,
<hi>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob;</hi> yet were they
all three like to be hunger-starued. Yea, not onely
so, but for their faith, many were burned and stoned,
<hi>of whom the world was not worthy, Heb.</hi> 11, 37. So fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it with the Apostles, they were hungry, naked,
and athirst, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 11. But what do we speake of
the adopted sonnes of God, when as his owne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Sonne suffered as much, nay, farre more? Here
wee see he was hungry, also he was wearied with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
and faine to rest: <hi>Iohn</hi> 4, 6. he had no house to
hide his head in, whereas <hi>Foxes haue holes.</hi>

               <head>If thou be the Sonne of God.</head>
               <p>THe Heathens haue obserued, that in Rhetoricke
it is a point of chiefest cunning, when you would
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19855:17"/>
out face a man, or importune him to do a thing, to
presse and vrge him with that, which hee will not or
cannot for shame denie to be in himselfe, As by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
If you haue any wit, then you will do thus and
thus: if you be an honest man or a good fellow, do
this. So here the deuill (not being to learne any point
of subtilty) comes to our Sauiour, saying; <hi>If thou be the
Sonne of God.</hi> (as it may be doubted, you being in this
case:) then, <hi>make these stones bread.</hi> No, no, it followes
not: a man may be the sonne of God, and not shew

Christ? they answered, <hi>If he had not beene a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
we would not haue brought him before thee, Iohn</hi>
18. 30. They were iolly graue men, it was a flat flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
and in <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. 23. there is the like. This ought
to put vs in minde, when we are tempted in like
manner, that we take heed we be not out-faced.</p>
               <p>In the matter it selfe wee are to consider these
points: First, the deuill sets it downe for a ground,
that (follow what will) bread must needs be had.
Therefore Christ first closeth with him. Admit hee
had bread, were he then safe? No, <hi>We liue not by
berad only:</hi> so that bread is not of absolute necessity.
Well, what followes of that? Bread you must needs
haue, you see your want, God hath left off to prouide
for you. Then comes the conclusion, Therefore shift
for your selfe as well as you can. First he soliciteth vs
to a mutinous repining within our selues, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 3, 8.
<hi>Harden not your hearts, as in the day of temptation, &amp;c.</hi>
whereby he forceth vs to breake out into such like
conceits, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 116, 11. <hi>I said in my distresse, that all
men be lyars:</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 31, 22. <hi>I said in my haste, I am
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19855:17"/>
cast off.</hi> Thus closely he distrusted God, in saying, his
Prophets prophecie lies, till at last, we euen open our
mouths against God himselfe, and say, <hi>This euill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
from the Lord: shall I attend on the Lord any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?
2 Kings</hi> 6, 33. Hunger and shame is all we shall
get at Gods hands. And so casting off God, betake
themselues to some other Patron, and then the deuill
is fittest for their turne. For when we are fallen out
with one, it is best seruing his enemy, and to retaine
to the contrary faction. Then wee seeke a familiar
(with <hi>Saul)</hi> to answer vs, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28, 7.</p>
               <p>But what did the deuill than tell him? did hee
bring comfort with him? No: he tels him, that to
morrow he and his sonnes should dye. So here doth
the deuill bring a stone with him. <hi>What Father</hi> (saith
Christ) <hi>if his Sonne aske him bread, would give him a
stone? Math.</hi> 7, 9. yet the diuell doth so; Christ was
hungry, and the deuill shewes him stones.</p>
               <p>Here is the Deuils comfort, here be stones for
thee, if thou canst deuise any way to make these
stones bread, thou art well; whereas we do not vse
to make bread of stones, but of wheate, to worke it
with the sweate of our browe: sto get it so, we learne
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3, 19.</p>
               <p>By extortion and vsurie we may make stones into
bread, that is the deuils Alchymistrie: or haply wee
may make bread of nothing, when a man gets a thing
by anothers ouersight, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43, 12. Or else, what and
if we can ouer-reach our brother in subtilty, and goe
beyond him with a tricke of wit or cunning? <hi>Let no
man defraud or oppresse his brother in any matter: for
the Lord is auenged of all such, 1 Thes.</hi> 4, 6. The one is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19855:18"/>
called, <hi>The bread of violence and oppression, Prou.</hi> 4, 17
The other, <hi>The bread of deceit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are indeed both made of stones, for they still
retaine their former property, as the euent will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
For though in the beginning such bread bee
pleasant, <hi>Prou.</hi> 20, 17. yet after, his <hi>mouth is but
filled with grauell, Prou.</hi> 20, 17. After
which will consequently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,

not liue by bread onely, but by euey word that
proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</q>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a good seruice that
<hi>Elisha</hi> (2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 6, 9.) did, to
tell the King of the traines
laid for him, when they lay
in ambush against him.
And euen this is the first vse
that wee haue of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Temptations.</p>
            <p>It warnes vs afore hand
of the deuils comming, so that we may haue time to
prepare our selues accordingly. For as at that time the
deuill came vpon Christ when hunger pinched him:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19855:19"/>
so where we are in any distresse, we are to looke for
temptations.</p>
            <p>This temptation hath two parts. First comes <hi>(Si,)</hi>
a distrust: Secondly followes vnlawfull meanes.
Hauing laid this foundation, that bread is necessary
to be had when one is hungry; hee inferreth, that
God helpeth nor, nor supplyeth the want: therefore
God is not the Father. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7, 9. and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
no longer on him, but shift for your selfe. This
is the eff<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>ct of the deuils argument.</p>
            <p>The Fathers vpon the words <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6, 16. <hi>(Take the
shield of faith, to quench all the fierie darts of the deuill:)</hi>
do note, that about euery one of the darts or temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the deuill, there are (as it were) balls of
wilde fire. For being to assault our obedience, and
knowing hat faith is our shield: to that end he vseth
the arrow-head, which is; distrust in God, about
which is fire, to wit; the vsing of vnlawfull meanes,
to consume our obedience, which will consume our
shield of faith, and so make way for the dark to kill or
wound vs. So that his drift is, to bring our adoption
or Son-ship to a <hi>Si.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt, but Christ was able to haue
turned stones into bread: but why would hee not
then follow the deuils aduice? The deuill by saying,
<hi>Say vnto these stones,</hi> seemeth to acknowledge, that he
had the force to haue done it, euen by his bare word:
for euen stones are said to heare the voyce of God,
and obey his commandement; and not onely Gods,
but euen Gods seruants, as 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 13, 5. when the man
of God had pronounced, that the Altar should rent
in sunder, it did so. And <hi>Math.</hi> 27, 5. when Iesus cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19855:19"/>
out with a loud voyce, the vayle of the Temple
rent in twaine, the earth did quake, and the stones
were clouen. The dead men are worse than stones,
yet they in their graues heard his voyce.</p>
            <p>And not onely was hee able to turne stones into
bread, but into men also: as Children to <hi>Abraham</hi>
of stones, <hi>Math.</hi> 3, 9. If therefore it had pleased him,
he was as well able at this time to haue turned stones
into bread, as after hee turned water into wine,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 2, 10.</p>
            <p>It was no lesse possible to him (no doubt) to haue
saued himselfe, when the <hi>Iewes</hi> scoffingly bad him,
<hi>Math.</hi> 27, 42. as to haue saued others; and to haue
come downe from the Crosse being aliue; as it was
after for him, not onely being dead and buried, but a
great stone being ouer him, to remoue it, and come
out of the graue, <hi>Math.</hi> 28, 2. He had power to both,
but not will alike to both.</p>
            <p>But why would he not here vse his power, for the
satisfying of his hunger, and follow the deuils ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice?
In setting downe the Historie of turning wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into wine, it is thus farther said, that he did it, <hi>that
his Disciples might beleeue in him, Iohn</hi> 2, 11. That was
the reason that moued him to the working of that
myracle: and because there was no such cause here,
he did it not. For the deuill would not beleeue in
him (he knew) though he had done it. The Deuill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
him, but to haue him shew what he could do,
for a need onely, for a vaunt of his power: wherein
we see the humour of pride, that made him at the first
to fall.</p>
            <p>It is the same temptation that his kinsfolkes vsed,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19855:20"/>
               <hi>No man doth any thing secretly, that seeketh to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous:
if thou dost these things, shew thy selfe to the
world.</hi> But see how vnfitly the Temptation hangeth
together. He should rather haue said, <hi>If you be hungry;</hi>
than <hi>If you be the Sonne of God:</hi> and then rather haue
bid him fast forty dayes more, than turne the stones
into bread. If it had beene to haue made a Sonne of
God, Christ would haue done it: but not to haue
shewed himselfe to be the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>But it may be asked, why did Christ vouchsafe to
giue him any answer at all; whereas he might haue
commanded him to silence, and <hi>tormented him before
his time,</hi> and haue punish<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>d him for his sawcinesse?
When <hi>Peter</hi> tempted him, he cut him vp very sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
saying; <hi>Come behinde me Sathan, Mark.</hi> 8, 33. Why
did he not answer the deuill so? He might haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
him, and throwne him into the bottomlesse
pit, <hi>Luke</hi> 8, 31. or at the least bidden him, <hi>Auoyd Sa\than, verse 10. Augustine</hi> answereth this doubt, that
Christ answered in the like time, to teach vs to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
willing vs thereby (as <hi>Abimelech</hi> did his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers)
to doe as he had done before, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9, 48. So
Christ is our example, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13, 15. and bids vs <hi>do</hi> as
<hi>he hath done.</hi> Christ is our Captaine, he hath gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs, and shewed vs how to behaue our selues in
fight: when the diuell assaulteth vs with distrust,
then are we to ward it off with a Text of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence;
and so to the rest, as hee hath done before
vs. Our Sauiours shield, whereby (we see) he beareth
off all the deuils darts, is couered all ouer with <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
est.</hi> We haue here a briefe view of the Churches
Armorie, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4, 4. of the Tower of <hi>Dauid,</hi> built for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19855:20"/>
defence. Heere be the shields wherewith <hi>Salomons</hi>
Temple was hanged, and which <hi>Paul</hi> calleth, <hi>The
weapons of our warfare, 2 Cor.</hi> 10, 4. not carnall, but
mighty (through God) to cast downe holds.</p>
            <p>They are in number fiue: First, a preparation of
our selues by the vse of Gods Sacraments, that wee
may bee the more strong to sustaine and beare off
temptations, and to hold out to the end without
fainting. Secondly, a withdrawing our selues into the
desert, or some other solitary place, there (by Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
to kindle good thoughts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39, 3. Thirdly,
fasting. Fourthly, watchfull prayer, <hi>Math.</hi> 26, 41. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the perfecting our selues in the Scriptures. These
be the fiue shields wherewith <hi>Salomons</hi> Tenple was
hanged.</p>
            <p>Now as for the Scripture, wee are to note, that
where God speaketh of any good that wee are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
out of it, it is commended to vs as a storehouse,
whether wee are to make our resort for the bread of
life, and the water of life, <hi>whereof he that tasteth, shall
neuer thirst, Iohn</hi> 6, 35. And from thence are we to
draw the waters of comfort, out of the fountaines of
saluation, <hi>Esay</hi> 12, 3. When there is any ill spoken of
which we are to resist, then it is commended to vs as
an Armory, whence wee may fetch any kinde of
weapon which we shall need, either offensiue, as a
sword, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4, 12. or defensiue, as a shield, <hi>Prou.</hi> 30, 5.</p>
            <p>The Scripture is the broad plate that is to beare
off the darts: our faith is the braces or handle wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we take hold, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6, 16. and lift it vp to defend
our selues withall. For the Scripture is a shield, <hi>Non
quod dciitur, sed quod, dicitur. Dicitur;</hi> there is the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19855:21"/>
strong and broad matter, fit to beare off: and <hi>Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
that is the handle or braces to it, <hi>God spake once or
twice, I haue heard it, power belongeth vnto God, Psal.</hi>
62, 11.
So that it sufficeth not that it be spoken onely
by God, but we must heare it too: neither must wee
heare it as the voyce of a man (as <hi>Samuel</hi> at the first
did; who when God called him, thought it the voice
of <hi>Eli:)</hi> but as the voice of God, that we which were
dead in our sinnes, he hath quickned and forgiuen vs
all our trespasses, 1 Thes. 2, 13. This is the perfection
of our faith.</p>
            <p>Generally of the Scriptures, this is Christs opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
confirmed by his owne practise; that if the diuell
come as a Serpent, here is a charme for him, <hi>Psal</hi> 58,
5. Or if he come as a Lyon, here is that is able to
preuaile against him, 1 Pet. 5, 8. And that the deuill
knowes well enough, as appeareth by bis malice that
hee hath alwayes borne it, before it was Scripture,
when is was but onely <hi>Dictum.</hi> For so soone as God
had said, <hi>Let vs make man in our likenesse,</hi> that word
was straight a whetstone to the deuils enuie. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fall, when the seed was promised, that was, and
is the cause of all the deuils enmitie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31, 15. So
when the promise was reitterated, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 18. that
was the cause he so turmoyled all the Patriarchs.</p>
            <p>But when the word was to be written, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Scripture, then his malice began to grow very
hot, insomuch that he caused it for anger to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 32, 19 For the Fathers are of opinion, that
all the deuils busie endeuour, in making the <hi>Israelites</hi>
to commit idolatry with the golden Calfe, was to
the end, that he might so heate <hi>Moses</hi> in his zeale, as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19855:21"/>
that in his anger he should breake the Tables of the
Law, by casting them hastily out of his hands. We
are to note therefore, that there is a forceable sound
in the word, which the Deuill cannot abide; and
not onely the sound, but the sight also.</p>
            <p>It is written of <hi>Augustine,</hi> that lying sicke on his
bed, he caused the seuen poenitentiall Psalmes to be
painted on the wall ouer against him, in great Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
that if after he should become speechlesse yet
he might point to euery verse when the deuill came
to tempt him; and so confute him. <hi>Blessed is he that
hath his quiuer full of such arrowes, they shall not hee
ashamed.</hi> Blessed is he that hath the skill to choose out
fit arrowes for the purpose, as the Fathers speake out
of <hi>Esay</hi> 49, 2. Christ saith affirmatiuely of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that <hi>in them is eternall life, Iohn</hi> 5, 39. Negatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the cause of error, is the not knowing of
them, <hi>Marke</hi> 12, 24. <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, it was that that
made him wiser than his enemies, than his teachers,
and than the Ancients, <hi>Psalm. 119, 98, 99, &amp;</hi> 110.
Knowledge of the truth, is the way to amendment
after a fall, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 26. There is much calling now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies
for the Word, and others finde fault as fast, that
it is no better harkned vnto. For as the want of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and all other abuses (which are so much cried
out against) proceede not onely from the not hearing
of the word, but as well from the not mingling of
faith with it, (without which mixture, it is nothing
worth) it profiteth not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4, 2. So the error of the
former times was, in yeelding too farre to the deuils
policie, by sealing vp the Scriptures, and locking the
storehouse and Armorie of the people. It is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19855:22"/>
Christ tels vs of in the 11. of <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospell 22.
A strong man puts the strong armed man out of his
house, and takes away his armour from him: then he
needs not feare him.</p>
            <p>The like policie we read of, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13, 19 when
the <hi>Philistims</hi> had taken away all Smithes and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
then they thought they were safe. So in the
time of darkenesse, the deuill might let them do their
good workes, and what they list, and yet haue them
still vnder his lure: that he might offend them at his
pleasure, that had no armour to resist him. All the
Children of God, had a right and property in the
Law of God, as appeareth by Christs words, <hi>Iohn</hi>
10, 34. he answered them, that is, the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Is it not written in your Law?</hi> As though hee
should say, the Scripture is yours. To the young man
(in the tenth Chapter of S <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospell, and 26.
verse) that asked Christ <hi>what he should do to be saued?</hi>
Christ answereth: <hi>What is written in the Law? how
readest thou?</hi> Whereunto the answer, that we cannot
read, or that the booke is sealed vp, <hi>Esay</hi> 29, 11. is as
the deuill would haue it. Then hath he a fit time to
offer vs stones to make bread of. But this answer
with our Sauiour Christ will not he allowed of.</p>
            <p>Now come wee to the speciall point of Christs
answer, <hi>It is written, Man liues not by bread onely, &amp;c.
Deut</hi> 8, 3. There is no better kinde of reasoning, than
that, when one grants all that hath beene said by his
aduersarie, and proueth it to make on his part; and
vpon a new conceit, auoyds all that his aduersarie
said. Here our Sauiour might confesse all that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
objected; as that he is the Sonne of God; and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19855:22"/>
admit the stones were made bread, and that bread
were of absolute necessity, and that it were so to be
come by (which is vntrue,) were we then in good
case?</p>
            <p>This indeed is the deuils position, wherewith he
would perswade all those that haue <hi>animam tritice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
(as the Fathers call it:) that those externall things
are necessary to bee had: and that if they haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
thereof, they are well enough; as we see it to
be the minde of the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12, 19. This man
hauing a wheaten soule, hauing corne enough, bad
his <hi>soule take rest,</hi> and liue merrily <hi>for many yeeres.</hi> But
Christ goeth further, and saith; Though the stones
be made bread, it will not auayle, except it please
God (by the blessing of his word) to giue vertue, and
(as it were) life vnto the bread, there is no difference
betweene it, and a stone.</p>
            <p>It is not the plenty or quality of victuals, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
some dote vpon such externall meanes, as they
did, which sacrificed to their net, and burnt incense
to their yerne, <hi>Abac.</hi> 1. 16. because by them their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was fat, and their meates plentuous. For what
saith <hi>Iob</hi> 31, 27. <hi>If I reioyced because my substance was
great, this had beene an iniquity.</hi> So that our life is not
maintained by bread onely, descended out of the
mould of the earth. The nature of bread and stones
are not much vnlike, they come both out of one bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
that is to say, the earth, <hi>Iob</hi> 28, 5, 6. and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
the one of them hath no more power than the
other vnto life: for we know that the <hi>Israelites</hi> died,
euen while the flesh of Quayles was in their
mouthes, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11, 33. and <hi>Manna</hi> (heauenly fare)
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19855:23"/>
being farre better than our bread. It is the deuils craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
policie, to burie a mans life vender a loafe of bread:
and (as it were) to fetter the grace of God to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
meanes; whereas they of themselues are of no
efficacie, without the operation and grace of the
word, than a hammer and a sawe, without a hand,
able to employ them.</p>
            <p>Dauid <hi>saith</hi> (Psal. 104, 28.) The eyes of all things
waite on God for their meat in due season, and thou fillest
them: <hi>With what? with bread? No, but</hi> with thy
blessing and goodnesse. <hi>Our hearts must be</hi> stablished
with grace, not with meats. Heb. 13, 9. <hi>It is Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue,
that as all things had their beginning from
him,</hi> Col. 1, 17. <hi>so he supporteth and sustaineth them,</hi>
Heb. 1, 3.</p>
            <p>This is a further point than all Philosophy tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs. For they hauing laid downe the foure ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
bare and simple essences, <hi>tanquam materiam,</hi>
by compounding and tempering of them, they bring
forth a cercaine quintenssence or balme full of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
But Diuinitie leadeth so to a quintessence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, all the quintessences and balmes in the
world can do vs no good.</p>
            <p>To the question that <hi>Ieremie</hi> propoundeth, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8,
22. <hi>Is there no balme at Gilead? Is there no Physitian
there?</hi> The answer may be, Mans health is not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
by balme or physicke onely, <hi>but by euery word
that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</hi> if wee weigh
Christs argument aright. For we may see, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
16, 12. <hi>Asa</hi> dyed for all his Physitians that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him. So if it be asked, Are there no horses nor
chariots in <hi>Gilead?</hi> we may answer, warlike victory
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19855:23"/>
consisteth not in warlike furniture onely, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
the name of the Lord God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 20, 7. A
horse is a vaine thing to saue, without the power of
this word. And so when a man thriues nor, or pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
not in his actions; it is not often for want of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
or care: <hi>Psal.</hi> 127, 1. tels him, <hi>Except the Lord
build the house, &amp;c. Augustine</hi> aduiseth his Auditorie;
to beleeue it in time, least (by wofull experience) they
finde it to bee true, when 'as they shall haue such a
consumption, that no meat shall do them any good;
or such a dropsie, that no drinke shall auayle them.
The power and vertue of this word is called, <hi>The
staffe of bread, Leuit.</hi> 26, 26. and it is meant of a chiose
staffe, such a one as is set in the middest, to beare vp
all the Tent. The plainest similitude I can vse, to
make you vnderstand the force thereof, is this:
When we goe to Physicke for any disease, wee are
bidden seethe such hearbs in running water, and
then to drinke the water, we know it is not the water
which helpeth, but the decoction of infusion, So it
is not the bread (considered barely in it selfe) that
nourisheth vs, but the vertue and grace of the word
infused into it. We are not therefore to sticke to the
meanes, like the Glutton, <hi>Luke</hi> 12, 19. but to pray for
this blessing. And to this end, God (in the establishing
of nature) hath thereout reserued foure speciall prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues
to his Word.</p>
            <p>As first, with a very little of the meanes, to go far
in operation, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 17, 14. with a little oyle and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
wheat, he fed <hi>Elias,</hi> the poore widdow, and her
sonne a great while. And <hi>Math.</hi> 17. 14. Christ made
fiue loaues &amp; two fishes serue fiue thousand persons.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19855:24"/>
The heathen man thought no certaine proportion
was to be set downe for a familie, because when a
heauenly hunger commeth on men, they eate more
at one time, than at another. But whatsoeuer the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
haue spoken wisely, we haue farre more wisely
vttered by the holy Ghost, in one place or other. In
<hi>Psal.</hi> 17, 14. this is set downe, where there is mention
made of a certaine hidden treasure, wherewith means
bellies be filled, and <hi>Haggi.</hi> 1, 6. saith, <hi>Men eat much,
yet haue not enough; drinke much, but are not filled.</hi>
This is the first prerogatiue.</p>
            <p>His second is, he takes order as well for the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as for the quantitie; course meates and fine are
all one with him; for the <hi>Israelites</hi> (notwithstanding
their <hi>Quayles</hi> and <hi>Manna)</hi> died: and <hi>Daniel</hi> and his
fellowes, that fed vpon course meates, looked better
than all the children that were fed with the Kings
owne dyct, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1, 15.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, without meanes he worketh sometimes.
Therefore <hi>Asa</hi> had said little or nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14, 1 1. If he had said, <hi>God helpeth by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or few</hi> (if he had not put in too) <hi>and sometimes by
none.</hi> For there was light before any Sunne or
Moone, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1, 3. though after (<hi>verse 14).</hi> it pleased
God to ordaine them as instruments. And so <hi>Gen.</hi>
2, 5. the earth was fertile, when as then no rayne had
falne on the earth, nor any such ordinary meanes.
Let <hi>Moses</hi> be on the Mount, and but heare God, and
he needeth no bread.</p>
            <p>The fourth is, that hee can bring his purpose to
passe, euen by those meanes whose natures tend to
contrary effects; as to preserue by stones. <hi>Colloquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:19855:24"/>
being ranke poyson, (in eating whereof is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
death) was (by the Prophet) made matter of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4, 40. So Christ, by those things
which were fit to put out a seeing mans eies, as
dust; made a blinde man recouer his sight, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9, 6.
And so doth hee make light to shine out of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 6. One contrary out of another. Thus
we see the deuill answered. Now let vs apply these
things to our selues.</p>
            <p>Christs answer doth import two words, and so
two mouthes, and two breaths, or spirits: and these
two be as two twinnes. He that will be maintained
by the one, must seeke after the other. The first word
is the same decree, whereby the course of nature is
established, according to <hi>Psal.</hi> 147, 15. <hi>Hee sendeth
forth his commandement vpon the earth, and his word
runneth verie swiftly: he giueth snow like wooll, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the other is that whereof <hi>Iames</hi> 1, 18.
speaketh: to wit, <hi>the word of truth,</hi> wherewith (of his
owne will) he begat vs. The one proceedeth from the
mouth of Gods prouidence, creating and gouerning
all things, <hi>Psal.</hi> 33, 6. <hi>he but spake the word, and it
was done.</hi> The other proceedeth out of the mouth of
Gods Prophets, who are (as it were) his mouth, <hi>Ier.</hi>
15, 19. <hi>Thou standest before mee, as if thou wert my
mouth.</hi> From the first word, all things haue their
beginning and being; as when he sent forth his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
or breath, they were created and had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
So <hi>Psal.</hi> 104, 29. he teacheth vs, that so soone
as God hides his face, they are troubled. And if he
takes away their breath, they dye, and returne to
dust. The other spirit, that is, the sanctifying Spirit,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19855:25"/>
ministreth vnto vs supernaturall life, <hi>Esay</hi> 56, 21.
Now therefore to set them together, euery man is
thus to thinke with himselfe. If I get my liuing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Gods word, that is, by any vnlawfull meanes;
surely Gods other word will not accompany such
gotten goods. That is, these two words be twinnes:
if we get not our goods by the one word, we shall
want the blessing of the other word, and then wee
were as good eate stones: it will bee but grauell in
our mouthes, or Quailes. We are then to vse the
meanes, according to the second word. <hi>Abraham</hi>
(we see) went forth to sacrifice, according to Gods
appointment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. the Word was his direction:
therefore when <hi>Isaac</hi> asked, <hi>Where was the Sacrifice?</hi>
he might boldly answer, <hi>God would prouide one;</hi> as
wee see euen at the very pinch he did: whereupon it
came to be a prouerbe, that euen <hi>In monte, Iehoua pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidebit.</hi>
The <hi>Israelits</hi> went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and appointment of Gods Word. How then?
First, they had <hi>away</hi> made them (where neuer was
any before) through the Red-sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14, 21. they
had <hi>bread</hi> downward out of the clouds, whereas it
vseth to rise vpwards out of the earth: their <hi>garments</hi>
in fortie yeeres neuer waxed old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8, 3, 4. they
had <hi>water,</hi> whence water vseth not to come; by stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Rockes, water gushed forth: So that it is
true which the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34, 9. <hi>There
is no want to them that feare God.</hi> Though (peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
he will not vse the same meanes he did for the
<hi>Israelites;</hi> yet the Children of God (walking after his
will) shall haue some way of reliefe alwayes. And
therefore Christ would not distrust the prouidence
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19855:25"/>
of God: for hee knew he was in the worke and way
of God. For we reade, <hi>that he was led into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
by the Spirit,</hi> and therefore could not lacke; as
indeed he did not, for the Angels came and minstred
vnto him: as it followeth in the 11. verse of this
Chapter. So either the Crowes shall minister to our
wants, as they did to <hi>Elias:</hi> or our enemies, as the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> did to the <hi>Israelites:</hi> or else the Angels
themselues, as they did here.</p>
            <p>But to grow to a conclusion, <hi>Let vs seeke the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God, and all other things shall be ministred vnto
vs.</hi> And in all like temptations, we may learne a good
answer out of <hi>Dan.</hi> 3, 17. <hi>That God that we serue, is able
to releeue and deliuer vs, euen the burning fire:</hi>
But, if it should not be his will so to do, yet wee will
not vse vnlawfull meanes, or fall to Idolatry, or turne
stones into bread. In this answer (againe) Christ
would teach vs here to be resolute, howsoeuer Gods
blessing doth not concurre with our gettings, as it
doth not when wee get them by indirect meanes,
contrary to Gods word. To goods so gotten, God
will adde sorrow: for <hi>The blessing of the Lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
rich, and he doth adde no sorrowes with it, Prouerb.</hi>
10, 22. When God giues riches, hee giues quietnesse
withall: but if God giue them not, we were as good
be without them, whether they be gotten by oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or violence, <hi>Prou</hi> 4, 17. or by fraud and deceit,
<hi>Prou.</hi> 20, 17. For these two be the quick-siluer and
brimstone of the deuils Alchymistrie. God will adde
sorrow to them: for though they be pleasant at the
first, <hi>Proueob.</hi> 20, 17. and money gotten by stinking
meanes, smels like other money (as an Emperour
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19855:26"/>
said:) and bread so gotten, tastes like other bread:
yet in the end a plaine conclusion and experiment
will make it manifest, that it was made of stones, and
had sorrow mingled or added to it. And therefore it
shall bee either an occasion or matter of the disease
called the <hi>Stone:</hi> or it shall turne his meate in his
bowels, and <hi>fill him with the gall of Alps, Iob</hi> 20, 14. or
as <hi>Asaes</hi> oppression by delicacie became an occasion
of the dropsie or gout: or else shall the executioner
catch all that hee hath, and the stranger spoile him,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 109, 11. or spend them vpon Physitians, <hi>Marke</hi>
5, 26. or on Lawyers: or else, though God suffer them
to enjoy them quiet all their life time, and euen to die
by their flesh pots; yet on their death-bed they shall
finde such a grudging and torment in their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that they will wish that they had starued for
hunger, before they had begun to vse any such means.
Or if God in his iudgement (for their greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
suffer them to die in their beds, without any
remorse of conscience, like blockes, or like an Oxe
dying in a ditch; at the last day they shall feele
a gnashing in their teeth, and then
they will know it was made
of stones.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>Then the deuill tooke him vp into the holy Citie,
and set him on a pinacle of the Temple,</p> 
                  <p>And said vnto him, If thou be the Sonne of God,
cast thy selfe downe: for it is written, That

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He manner is, after one hath
taken a foyle, his courage will
faile. The Angell would haue
beene gone, when he saw hee
could not preuaile ouer <hi>Iacob,
Gen.</hi> 32, 26. But it is not so heere
with the deuill. For when hee
saw that his first temptations would not preuaile,
he tryeth another. And euen so he played with <hi>Iob:</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:19855:27"/>
for when he could do no good vpon his first patent,
by taking away all that he had, he comes and sues for
a new Commission, that he might touch his flesh and
bones, <hi>Iob</hi> 2, 5. and thereby hee giueth vs to learne,
That it is not one foyle that can make him giue ouer.
He is one of those, whom a Father saith, to haue cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
aboue their strength; and of that nature be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in our daies, whose daring is aboue their skill;
and haue courage to vndertake much more than
their ability is to performe. Not like <hi>Dauid,</hi> who did
as much as he vndertooke in killing <hi>Goliah</hi>: nor like
him of whom <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh in the seuenth verse of
his third Chapter, that when they would haue made
him Prince, he had <hi>no bread nor cloathing,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
refused: but they will take it vpon them though
they haue not wherewithall, and thereby become
Authors of trouble, wanting abilitie to goe through
withall. But as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith; Is it not all one not to
be able to answer, nor to be able to hold their peace?
We see here the Deuill is a great vndertaker.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is not onely content to take a foyle,
but euen out of the same thing wherewith he was
foyled maketh hee matter of a new Temptation, a
new ball of fire. Out of Christs conquest, he makes a
new assault; that is, since he will needes trust, he will
set him on trusting, he shall trust as much as he will.
As the fo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>mer tempted him to diffidence; so this
sh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>ll tempt him to presidence. As before the diuell
brought him to the waters of <hi>Meribah (Exod. 17, 7.)</hi>
where the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> did murmure and tempt
God: so now he brings him to the temptation
of <hi>Massah, (Deut. 6, 16.)</hi> that is, to presumption, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19855:27"/>
and delicacie: for then with bread they
were not content, but they must haue flesh and other
dainties, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78, 20. As the first might be called the
<hi>hungry Temptation,</hi> so this may be called, <hi>The wanton
Temptation.</hi> That which was in the old Testament
the Temptation of <hi>Meribah,</hi> is here in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Temptation of the Wildernesse; and that
which was there the Temptation of <hi>Massah,</hi> is heere
the temptation of the Pinacle.</p>
            <p>In the first, by want of things necessary, he thought
to driue them to vexation and bitternesse of spirit,
and to distrust Gods power and goodnesse. In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
by vnnecessary matters, hee draweth vs on to
wantonnesse, and to put God to try what he can doe,
and to set him about base seruices; by the one, he
driueth vs vnto vnlawfull meanes, by the other, he
draweth vs from the vse of things lawfull: by the
one, he brings vs to this conceit, that wee are so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
of God, that if we trust in him, hee will in the
end faile vs; by the other, to thinke we are so deare
in Gods eyes, and such darlings, as throw our selues
into any danger, and he will not forsake vs. By the
one, he puts vs in feare (as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith:) <hi>Deum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futurum,
eatiam si promisit;</hi> by the other, in hope, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
adfuturum, vbi non promist:</hi> by the one, he slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
God vnto vs, as if he were a God of straw, of
base condition, and subiect to our becke; by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as if he were a God of iron, that would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
though we requested him.</p>
            <p>Now to the Temptation: wherein we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
three things. First, the ground the Deuill chose
for the working of this Temptation. Secondly, the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19855:28"/>
temptation it selfe; to wit, the deuils speech. Thirdly,
Christs answer to it. In the place, three things are
to be noted: First, the place it selfe: Secondly, the
deuill chose it: Thirdly, that our Sauiour followed
him thither. For a new temptation he makes choyce
of a new place. Indeed for a temptation to presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Wildernesse was not a fit place: first it was
not high enough, and then it was not populous
enough. It was a melancholly place: when a man is
vnder the crosse in affliction, or in some anguish and
sorrow for want, death of friends, or otherwise; and
generally for all solitarie men: the <hi>hungry Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is fitter than this of <hi>Presumption.</hi> As long as
<hi>Noah</hi> was in the Arke in the midst of the waters, hee
had in him no presumptuous thought: but sitting
vnder the Vine in his Vineyard, hee was ouercome
therewith. And iust <hi>Lot (2 Pet. 2, 8.)</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> had
no fit time or place to be presumptuous; but when
he dwelt in the mountaine in security, then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
incest with his Daughters, being made drunk
by them. <hi>Dauid,</hi> so long as he was persecuted by
<hi>Saul,</hi> and tossed vp and downe from post to pillar, had
no leysure to be presumptuous: but in the top of his
Turret, when hee was at rest in his Pallace, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
11, 2. presumption gaue him a blow. So here the
Wildernesse was no fit place, but the Pinacle is a
very fit place for one to be presumptuous on. It is as
good as a stage to shew himselfe vpon, to see and to
be seene.</p>
            <p>In the Wildernesse there was small warrant for
one that would be presumptuous: but from the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
he might discerne farre and neere, both the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19855:28"/>
Court and outward Court, and see a whole
Cloud of Witnesses, and haue some warrant of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of all estates, high or low, wise or noble. For
what abuse soeuer be in him, be hee neuer so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous,
he shall see some as proud, stout, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
as himselfe: be his hayre neuer so long, or
his ruffes neuer so great, he shall finde some as farre
gone therein as himselfe.</p>
            <p>If we marke the foure gradations that it hath, wee
shall finde it to be a very fit place. As first, before he
could come to the Pinacle, he must go out of the
Wildernesse into the Citie: Secondly, not any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but the holy Citie: Thirdly, into the Temple of
the Citie: And fourthly, out of the Temple vp to
the Pinacle. First, (hauing got him to leaue the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse)
he brought him into the Citie, that there he
might say vnto him: You see such and such graue
men, how they behaue themselues: why should you
seeke to be holier than they? This was a good ciuell
temptation: he brought him not to <hi>Cesarea</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi>
but euen to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the <hi>holy Citie:</hi> for that
addition is giuen it, <hi>Luke</hi> 4, 9. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 9, 24. Thirdly,
he brought him into the Temple, where euen the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ground was holy. Fourthly, not to any other
place of it, but the very top and Pinacle which was
ouer the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum.</hi> Who would not
tread hard there? and take vpon him, being in such a
place, where if a man will be carried away with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
he may see <hi>Ananias</hi> the high-Priest, renting
his cloathes, at the hearing of things that sounded
like blasphemy, <hi>Marke</hi> 14, 63. and yet buying his
Bishopricke for money? who will not then be bold
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19855:29"/>
to do the like? And <hi>Herod</hi> a Prince, such a one as
heard <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> preach; yea, and with <hi>much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi>
to commit adultery, <hi>Marke</hi> 6, 20. who would
feare to do the like? There he may see the Pharisie,
vnder shew of great holinesse, tything <hi>Mint</hi> and
<hi>Cummin,</hi> and vnder colour of long prayers, deuour
widowes houses, bringing in by extortion, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
out by excesse, <hi>Math.</hi> 23, 14, 21. And so in this
Citie, one may see some men, both great frequenters
of Sermons, and yet great vsurers; Gentlewomen
mishapen in their attyre. Seeing this, who will not be
as bold as they, the place being so holy? And being
thus warranted by example, surely we must needes
commend the deuils wit, for his choyce.</p>
            <p>Out of this, arise two notes. First, against some
phantasticall spirits, who say; Can that bee an holy
Citie, where there be dumbe dogges? There were
so in <hi>Ierusalem, Esay</hi> 56, 10. Where the leaders bee
blinde? <hi>Mat.</hi> 15, 14 They were so where <hi>Iudas</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
the Sacrament, where there is diuision and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
amongst themselues, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4, 2. Can this (say they)
be the holy Citie? And thereupon they forsake the
fellowship, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 25. Whereas they (not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the former abuses, and notwithstanding the
eleuen Tribes were Apostates) did yet name it the
holy Citie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, on the other side wee are to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
though a man be on the battlements of the
Church, yet hath he no sure sooting, or cause to be
secure; but rather to feare the more: for euen there
doth the deuill stand at his elbow, watching his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow.
There is no place (we see) priuiledged from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19855:29"/>
temptations, no Desert so solitary, but the deuill will
seeke it out: no Pinacle so high, but the deuill is a
Bishop ouer it, to visit and ouer-looke it.</p>
            <p>To conclude, though in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> sits the <hi>abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of desolation</hi> (whereof <hi>Dauid</hi> spake;) yet it is
the holy Citie still. And though the place be neuer
so holy, yet is that no cause of priuiledge; but euen
there may fit <hi>the abhomination of desolation.</hi> Both are
proued out of <hi>Math.</hi> 24, 15.</p>
            <p>The second thing that we obserued in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of place, is; that the Deuill assumpted Christ:
which, to those that are weake (as <hi>Gregorie</hi> also col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth)
may be offensiue, in giuing them to thinke,
that the deuill had such power ouer Christ, as to
carrie him whether he listed. But when they shall
consider, that euen the limbes of the deuill haled and
harrowed him too and fro, from <hi>Annas</hi> to <hi>Caiphas,</hi>
from <hi>Caiphas</hi> to <hi>Pilat</hi> from <hi>Pilat</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> and from
him backe againe to <hi>Pilat:</hi> and how spitefully and
contemptuously he was vsed in all these places, and
at last carried to execution: what meruayle will it
be to see him (as <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh:) <hi>In monte duci
Ã  capite, qui Ã  membris in additure, &amp;c.</hi> These things
do indeed (as all other his sufferings) set forth the
greatnesse of the loue of God towards vs. Of God
the Father, that he would giue his onely Sonne; yea,
appoint him this worke of out saluation, and giue the
deuill such a power oner him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22, 53. Of God
the Sonne, that he would be content to suffer such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity,
<hi>phl.</hi> 2, 7. as to be <hi>obedient to the death of the
Crosse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reason of all these his sufferings, as also that he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19855:30"/>
would be baptized of <hi>Iohn,</hi> a weake and sinnefull
man; was (as himselfe declareth it) to <hi>fulfill all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
Math.</hi> 3. 15. So here he was to suffer it, else
Gods righteousnesse would not haue beene fulfilled,
nor the worke of our saluation. And as he suffered
this Assumption, so afterwards, <hi>Luke</hi> 9, 51. his second
Assumption was, to go to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to suffer: and so
at the last he came to his third and last Assumption,
to be receiued vp into glory, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 16. And by the
very same steps and degrees, must we be assumpted.
And this is the assumption of suffering, which
brought him to glorifying.</p>
            <p>The third thing is, that our Sauiour followed;
whereby we are to marke, not so much his courage,
that he durst encounter with the Deuill, in any place
wheresoeuer he list to carry him: and that hee was
not onely the God of the valleyes, but a God of the
mountaines also, contrary to their surmise, 1 <hi>King.</hi>
20, 23. That (I say) is not so much to be marked, as
that our Sauiour would at all stand vpon a Pinacle.
There be some that would make vs beleeue, it is a sin
to stand vpon a Pinacle: but then if that had beene
so, Christ would neuer haue stood there. And since
Christ stood there, it is no more sinne for any man
else to stand there, than it is to stand in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
for it is lawfull for vs to follow his foot-steps,
and to tread wheresoeuer he hath trod before vs; yet
such places be not priuiledged. For, as it is true, that
many mens table and wealth is their snares, <hi>Psal. 69,
22.</hi> euen so the good gifts and graces of God, betur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to a mans hurt: as knowledge may serue for a
quill to puffe him vp, and make him swell, 1 <hi>Con.</hi> 8, 1.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19855:30"/>
Nay, euen that godly sorrow, which is so much to be
wished for, hath in it matter of temptation, least men
bee swallowed vp with too much heauinesse,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 7.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures themselues (we see) are subiect to
the abuse of the deuill: whereby it should follow,
that they are to be refused, if euery thing be refused
which brings matter of temptation. But as <hi>Augustine</hi>
saith, <hi>Non est laus stetisse in pinaculo, sed stetisse &amp; non
cecidisse.</hi> In euery place to answer the deuill, is praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.
Indeed it is dangerous for one that hath a
light and giddy braine, for such as are drunke, <hi>Esay
51, 22.</hi> (though not with wine) to stand so high. <hi>Iob</hi>
could stand there without falling, for he had a more
setled braine, <hi>Iob</hi> 31, 27. Such places are forthe wisest
and sagest men. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> stood not there, but yet he
could haue stood there, for he had the tricke or skill
of it, as himselfe confesseth, <hi>Phil. 4, 12. I can be abased,
and I can abound, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now come we to the Temptation it selfe, which
hath three generall heads. First, the ball of wilde
fire; which is to consume his faith. Secondly, the
dart, <hi>Cast thy selfe downe;</hi> which is to pierce the soule.
Thirdly, he tempereth the head of his dart with some
stronger mettall; which is, <hi>Scriptum est.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>FIrst, <hi>Si filius Dei es.</hi> This is a great mote in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
eye, hee vseth the same terme in the former
temptation, and here he is vp with it againe. And all
is to this end, that by often bringing it into question
whether hee be the Sonne of God; he may at last
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19855:31"/>
make it out of question or doubt, that we are not the
sonnes of God: that by and from <hi>Si sis,</hi> he may bring
it to <hi>Ne sis;</hi> and so we may be like hims<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>lfe. For to
this end is all his compassing of sea and land, to make
one Proselyte like himselfe, according to the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of the Pharisies, <hi>Math.</hi> 23, 15. who did in like
sort; and when he is made, yee make him (two-fold
more) the child of hell, then your selues. As on the
other side, Christ would haue vs the sonnes of God
like him. But see what a dexteritie the deuill hath, in
making things serue for his purpose: he maketh one
selfe same thing serue for two seuerall, yea, contrary
purposes. What a goodly grace he hath in the first
Temptation? He vseth it there to procure vs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparation:
he maketh it here to serue for presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But indeed there be two manner of <hi>Si es,</hi> or <hi>Ifs:</hi>
the one is a questioning or doubting, <hi>[Si;]</hi> as, <hi>If thou
be the Sonne of God, shew vs a signe,</hi> Marke 8, 12. <hi>Lord
if thou wilt, thou canst make me whole,</hi> Mat. 8, 2, The
other is a plaine affirmation, as <hi>Phil. 3, 11. If by any
meanes I might attaine to the resurrection of the dead:</hi>
where we are sure he made no doubt thereof. So
here the deuill saith, <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God,</hi> as I
now grant indeed. I was in some doubt, but now I
confesse thou art: I am of those voices minde, that
pronounced thee so at thy Baptisme.</p>
               <p>The deuill (in the former temptation) came out
like a malecontent, or a murmurer: here he comes
like a flattering parasite, he will <hi>pinguare caput eius
oleo,</hi> make his head euen swim in the oyle of osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
But though it be not the same temptation, yet
it is the same deuill in both places. For both by the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19855:31"/>
one and the other, he seeketh the downfall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of man: and though his two <hi>Ifs</hi> be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in themselues, yet are they both also contrary to
the will and word of God: for he would not in any
case we should distrust him, neith<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>r would he that at
any time we should cast our selues downe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath be caused battlements to be made on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
house top, that none might be slaine with falling
downe, <hi>Deut,</hi> 22, 8. Now he would haue him shew
himselfe (thereby) to be the Sonne of God, for he is
now in the sight of all <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is said, that Christ comes now to put too a sparke
of fire, that is of faith, and that his will was, it might
burne and be maintained. The deuill on the other
side, labours by all meanes possible to quench and
put it out: and seeing water would not do it in the
former temptation; he goeth now about to see, if he
can make the very oyle it selfe to put it out, euen that
very thing whereby it was to be maintained: as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it will, if we powre out too great a quantity.
Or if he cannot quench it, either with water or oyle,
he will see if he can blow it vp with gun-powder.
As, seeing the water of distrust will not extinguish
his faith, but that he would trust in God: he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth
now by Scriptures (that magnifie the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, and the confidence we are to put in
him) to set him as farre gone in the other extreame,
by presuming or trusting too much, that so the fire,
which before he would haue quenched, may now
so flame out, as not to keepe it selfe within the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
but to set the whole house on fire. This is
the ball of wilde-fire of this second Temptation:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19855:32"/>
and so both we seetend to the consuming and nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of our faith.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>II.</head>
               <p>THe dart it selfe is, <hi>[Cast thy selfe downe:]</hi> which
consisteth of two points. First, the casting down.
Secondly, that he himselfe was to cast downe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
For the first, it is generall, the neglect of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
meanes, as here. Whereas the ordinary way
was downe the staires, he would haue him leape, or
throw himselfe ouer the Battlements. And here a
man may see to what end the deuils halting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth:
he brings a man vp by little and little to some
high place, that so he may send him at once with his
head downward. All the preferments that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth
on a man, is not to any other intent, but that
he may do as the deuill himselfe did, (who being on
high, did cast himselfe downe) and so be like him,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 8, 23. that is, from beneath, not from aboue:
who fell from heauen like lightning, <hi>Luke</hi> 10, 18. So
that howsoeuer in outward shew he may seeme to
befriend vs, yet this is his inward intention and
scope. As the <hi>Edomites</hi> in time of the prosperitie of
the <hi>Israelites,</hi> pretended great good will to them: but
in the day of their great calamitie, they were they
that cryed, <hi>Downe with them, dawne weth them, Psal.</hi>
137, 7. Gods manner is, when he meaneth to exalt
a man, he will first humble him, and make him low,
<hi>Math.</hi> 23, 12. The deuils manner is (we see) cleane
contrary, <hi>Esay</hi> 14, 14. to lift them vp to the clouds,
that he may bring them downe to the graue, yea to
the lowest graue, <hi>Psal.</hi> 86, 13. He carrieth them the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19855:32"/>
higher, to throw them downe with the greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
He lifeth vp <hi>Adam</hi> with a conceit, to be like
God, to the very top of perfection, to the intent he
might be like the beast that perisheth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49, 20.</p>
               <p>The second hath some matter of comfort: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
is here a sutor to him, to do it himselfe. Why
doth not the deuill cast him downe? First, it was
not in his power; or if he had, yet would not that
haue serued his turne: then there had beene no sinne
of presumption in it. There must be two persons that
must concurre in our downfall: well may the deuill
induce and moue vs to it; but vnlesse we our selues
be consenting, and cast our selues downe, there can
be no down-fall to hurt vs. For as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith,
<hi>Nemo laeditur nisi Ã  seipso:</hi> so, <hi>Nullum precipitium nisi
voluntarium.</hi> The deuill did not cram <hi>Eue</hi> with the
forbidden fruite: but when she saw it, she tooke it,
and eate it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3, 6. So the deuill, when he entreth
into the soule of a man (which hee counteth his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace)
he doth not breake open the doore; no, nor so
much as draw the latch; but when he commeth, he
<hi>findeth it swept and garnished, Luke</hi> 11, 25. and so go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in.
There must therefore be a reaching out of the
hand, and an opening of the doore by our selues,
and so a casting downe of the selfe, or else, though
the deuill thrust sore at thee that thou maist fall, the
Lord will helpe thee, <hi>Psal.</hi> 118, 13. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 22, 8.
God hath caused battlements to bee made on euery
house top, by which we may stay our selues. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
tels God, that he had made a hedge about <hi>Iob,</hi>
Chap. 1, 10. so that vnlesse <hi>Iob</hi> step ouer it, or breake
it downe, he is safe.</p>

               <head>III.</head>
               <p>THe deuils dart is, <hi>Cast thy selfe downe:</hi> but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth
some great cost on this. With the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
armour that Christ bare off the other dart, doth
the deuill sharpen and harden this: he doth not so in
any other of the temptations, therefore wee are to
looke for some great matter: he bringeth Scripture,
that he may be the better credited. He speakes not
now <hi>after the manner of men, 1 Cor.</hi> 9, 8. so that it is
not he now that speaketh, but Scripture, as <hi>Paul</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth
there, <hi>You see</hi> (saith he) <hi>I counsell you to nothing,
but that the Psalmes will beare you out in.</hi> The deuill
knew well by his owne fall, how dangerous the sinne
of presumption is, it cost him dearely: and so did it
<hi>Dauid</hi> likewise, and therefore of all other, he praieth
God to <hi>keepe him from presumptuous sinnes: Psal. 19,
13.</hi> He knew also what it was to abuse the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
patience, and long suffering of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2, 4.
Therefore he auoucheth it by Scripture: he tels him,
it will be too long to go downe the stayres, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
teacheth him a neerer way, but to iumpe, or to cast
himselfe downe, and to feare no hurt, for the Angels
haue charge of him. And euen so he perswadeth men
now adayes; that they need not go downe faire and
softly, in feare and trembling, but to deferre all till
their dying houre, and then commend themselues to
God, and throw themselues vpon Gods mercy, and
that fiery Chariot that tooke vp <hi>Elias,</hi> shall come
and fetch vp them; or else, an Angell shall carry
them vp, let them be sure they shall haue no harme,
for they bee Gods darlings, and God doth so
dote on them, that hee will not suffer them in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19855:33"/>
any case to receiue the least hurt that may be.</p>
               <p>If euer the deuill came in his likenesse, it was here.
In the first of <hi>Sam.</hi> 28, 18. he came but in the guise of a
Prophet: so that in stead of saying, <hi>Is Saul among the
Prophets?</hi> it might haue beene said; What, is the
deuil among the Prophets? But here he hath vsed
himselfe so cunningly, that if euer he was transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>into an Angell of light,</hi> here it is verified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
11, 14. For he commeth here like a white deuill, or
like a Diuine; he comes with a Psalter in his hand,
and turnes to the place, and shewes our Sauiour the
91. <hi>Psalme, verse</hi> 11, 12. Wherein first we are to
note, that the deuill readeth <hi>Psalmes,</hi> as well as we,
and hath the words of Scripture in his mouth. And
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. he counterfeited <hi>Samuel</hi> so right, and vsed
the very words that he had vsed, that they could not
know him from <hi>Samuel:</hi> so here he counterfeited the
voice of <hi>Dauid, Acts</hi> 19, 15. This will make vs shake
off security, considering that God doth (for our triall)
sometime deliuer the aduersarie the okey of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
whereby he is able to hold argument with an
Archangell, <hi>Iude</hi> 9. yea, with Christ himselfe, as we
see here. How carefull therefore had we need to be,
to finde out a fit answer for him? For onely to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
vs doth he reade the Scriptures: yea, but not to
any good end, but euen thereby to deceiue the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie
of men; as heere to make them put their
soules in aduenture to the last houre. Hee hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a grace with some vaine youths of the Court,
and vngodly Atheists, to set them a scoffing at the
the Scripture, as <hi>Esay</hi> 28, 22. But with others, that
haue the Scriptures in more high reuerence, hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
another way to worke, making it to them the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19855:34"/>
of death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7, 10.</p>
               <p>The words which he vseth in the name of <hi>Samuel,</hi>
he vseth to make <hi>Saul</hi> dispaire: and here hee vseth
<hi>Dauids</hi> words to cause presumption, and to make
them our bane. And not euerie Scripture: but if
there be any Scripture more full of heauenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
than another, that of all other will the deuill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse;
as indeed the <hi>Psalmes</hi> are; &amp; of all the <hi>Psalmes,</hi>
this 91. especially: and in that part, if any one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
be sweeter than another, that of all other will
the deuill abuse. Marke the second verse here cited:
<hi>He shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee, to keepe thee in
all thy wayes.</hi> These last words the deuill leaues out,
because they make not for his purpose. <hi>They shall
beare thee in their hands, that thou dash not thy foote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a stone.</hi> And we shall see nothing can be spoken
more comfortable: as first, in that it is said, that the
Angels haue charge ouer vs in all our wayes, <hi>Exod.
23, 20. Behold I send my Angel before thee, to guide thee
in the way;</hi> &amp; to comfort, and confirme vs. As when
<hi>Iacob</hi> was in feare of his brother <hi>Esau,</hi> the Angel met
him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32, 1. and to defend vs in all dangers, and
succour vs in all necessities, spreading their wings o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vs, and pitching their tents about vs. <hi>Psal.</hi> 34, 7.
Secondly, this charge not onely concerneth our
head and principall members, but also our feet: yea,
Gods prouidence reacheth euen to the haires of our
head, for they are numbred, <hi>Math,</hi> 10, 30. Thirdly,
this charge of theirs is not onely to admonish vs
when danger commeth, but they are actually to helpe
vs, as it were putting their hands betweene the
ground and vs. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13, 14. They shall take the rubs
and offences out of our way. Fourthly, this do they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19855:34"/>
not of curtesie, as being creatures giuen by nature to
loue mankinde, but by speciall mandate and charge
they are bound to it, and haue a <hi>praecipe</hi> for it, yea,
the very beasts and stones shall be in league with vs.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Psalme,</hi> and these verses containing such
comfort, hath the Deuill culled to perswade men,
that being such sweete children of God, they may
venture whether and vpon what they will; for the
Angels attend them at an inch. He bids them put the
matter in adventure, and then but whistle for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
and they will come at first: he carrieth them vp
to the top of the Pinacle, and shewes them their own
case in <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Herod;</hi> and tels them God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
no more of them, than he did at their hands:
and all the way as they go vp, hee singeth them a
Psalme of the mercies of God: he carrieth them vp
with a song, that <hi>Gods mercy is aboue all his workes,
Psal.</hi> 145, 9. And with <hi>Psal. 103, 8. How gracious and
long-suffering God is, who rewardeth vs not according to
our deserts.</hi> And <hi>Psal. 136. That his mercy endureth for
euer:</hi> God therefore being so full of mercy, will take
all things in good part. But this mercy the deuill tels
them of, diffeteth from the mercy <hi>Dauid</hi> meant. For
the mercy <hi>Dauid</hi> speaketh of, is coupled with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Psal. 101, 1. 1 will sing mercy and iudgement to
thee O Lord:</hi> and <hi>Psal. 85. 10. Mercy and truth are
met together, Iustice and peace haue kissed each other.</hi>
Thus I say they shall haue musicke all the way, and if
any at the height thinke it a great way downe: no
(saith the deuill) you neede but a iumpe from your
baptisme into heauen, you shall need no stairs at all.</p>

speaketh nothing in vaine:</hi>
and that as our Sauiour
Christ saith, <hi>Iohn 10, 35. No
Scripture can be disappointed;</hi>
it may seeme strange that the
deuill comming armed with
<hi>The sword of the Spirit,</hi> (for
so is the word of God termed, <hi>Ephes. 6, 17.)</hi> Christ
giues not place, but opposeth himselfe to answer.
Wee see that a message comming in the name of the
Lord, this very name abashed <hi>Nehemias, (Neh. 6,
10.)</hi> at the first hearing, till he perceiued it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the law of God, and so came not from him:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19855:36"/>
which here we see to be the cause, why Christ doth
not yeeld by and by, vpon the hearing of the Word,
but sets himselfe to make answer: forsomuch as the
word is not of, <hi>Quia dicitur</hi> onely, but <hi>Quia ireditur,</hi>
as <hi>Augustine</hi> noteth. If there bee not the mixture of
faith with it, (whereof <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, <hi>Heb- 4, 2.)</hi> it is
nothing worth. And therefore the bad spirit was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
abashed or daunted at the hearing of the bare
names of <hi>Iesus</hi> and <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 19, 15. but answered,
<hi>I know them, but who are ye?</hi> They did not beleeue,
and therefore could do them no good, but were
wounded themselues: glorious names would not
serue the turne. So was it here vsed without faith.
When the Scripture is here vrged against one, a man
would thinke it were not to bee answered by citing
another place of Scripture, but by some tradition of
the Elders, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7, 1. or some glosse, or other shift;
but we see our Sauiour answereth here no other way
but by Scripture. Because, the Woolfe comes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
disguised in a sheeps skinne, it is no reason that
therefore the very sheepe should lay away their flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
so here, because the deuill vseth the Word, as
the slaying letter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 6. or as the sword to kill
men with; it is no reason why Christ may not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vse it in his owne defence. Why then (will some
say) one of these two inconueniences will follow;
that hereby wee shall thinke the Scripture is of the
deuils side, aswell as of Christ side, and so diuided;
as in like sort they make a diuision of Christ, when
one holds with <hi>Paul,</hi> another with <hi>Apollos,</hi> 1 Cor 1, 13.
No, it is not so, Christ alledgeth not this Scripture in
that sort, as one nayle to driue out another: but by
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19855:36"/>
way of harmonie and exposition, that the one may
make plaine the meaning of the other. For, albeit the
deuill sheweth himselfe to bee the deuill, in citing
that Text so, as might best serue for his purpose: in
that, whereas the <hi>Psalme</hi> whereout he taketh it, hath
it thus; <hi>That he might keep him in all his wayes;</hi> which
words he leaueth out. For if he had cited that, hee
could not thereby haue enforced any casting down.
For the Angels haue no charge ouer a man, but in
his wayes; and from the top of the Pinacle there
was no way, but downe the staires on his feete. He
was not (relying on the Angels) to cast himselfe
downe with his head forward. But the deuill hath a
wrest to make the string sound hye or low, as he list;
or if that will not serue, hee hath a racke to stretch
them out, as some did Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistiles, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3,
16. Hee can set them on the tenters, to proue, that
downe the staires, or ouer the battlements, all is one,
the Angels shall safe-gard him. Though this (I say)
be the deuils corruption, which the late writers haue
well spyed: yet Christ (we see) is not willing to take
aduantage of that, but vseth a wiser course; for so
are we to thinke, that he went the best way to work,
that is, the conference of Scripture with Scripture,
which Christ here practiseth, and commendeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs.</p>
            <p>In euery Art, all propositions are not of a like cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
but some be grounds and principles so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
as that no exception is to bee taken against
them. From them are others deriued, by a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
called <hi>Deduction,</hi> not so certaine as the other:
from these againe others, to the twentieth hand. So
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19855:37"/>
is it in Diuinity. Christ here reduceth the deuils argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and place, to a place most plaine to bee confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
For the Iewes valewing of the meaning, had to
consider, that God fed them with <hi>Manna,</hi> which they
knew not, to teach them, that <hi>Man liueth not by bread
onely, Deut.</hi> 8, 3. contemning the same: and in <hi>Deut.</hi>
6, 16. bad them, <hi>They should not tempt their Lord their
God,</hi> as in <hi>Messah,</hi> when they cryed for bread. The
Lord curseth him, that maketh flesh his arme, and
with-draweth his heart from God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17, 5. They sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
vnto their yarne, because their portion was
plentifull, <hi>Abac. 1, 16. Iob</hi> condemneth the making
<hi>gold our hope,</hi> or the <hi>wedge of gold our confidence,</hi> Chap.
31, 24. As then we must not defie the meanes, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
all-sufficiency to them: so we may not nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
them, &amp; thinke too basely of them, but vse them
that we tempt not God, according to his word.</p>
            <p>Out of these two grounds, may euery question be
resolued: for euery proposition must bee proued out
of the ground. So that, as wee way not thinke the
arme of God to be so shortned, that he cannot helpe
without meanes: so are we not to thinke basely of
God for ordaining meanes. Secondly, we heard, that
the deuils allegation was taken out of the <hi>Psalme,</hi> and
one of the most comfortable places of the <hi>Psalme.</hi>
Christ by not standing in Disputation about the
words and meaning of the Text, commendeth to vs
the safest and wisest way to make answer in such
like cases. Our Sauiour would warne vs, that the 91.
<hi>Psal.</hi> is not fit matter for vs to studie on, when wee
are on the top of the Pinacle: he therefore chuseth a
place of a contrary kinde, to counterpoise himselfe,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19855:37"/>
standing in that fickle place. The <hi>Law</hi> (we know) is a
great cooler to <hi>Presumption.</hi> If one tamper much with
the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> being in case of confidence, hee may
make the fire too bigge. Faith is the fire which
Christ came to put on the earth, and it is seated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two extreames, <hi>Distrust,</hi> and <hi>Presumption.</hi>
Distrust is as water to it, which if it be powred on in
abundance, it will make it to bee smoaking flaxe, or
vtterly quench it. Presumption (on the other side)
is a Gunpowder to it, which being throwne into it, it
will blow it vp, and make it flye all about the house.
Christ was to take heede of ouer-heating his faith.
<hi>Luther</hi> vpon the <hi>Galathians</hi> saith, the 91. <hi>Psalme</hi> is no
meete studie for many mens humors in our dayes:
they had more neede of a corrosiue, to eate out the
soare from the roote and bottome.</p>
            <p>Now to the answer, which consisteth of sixe
points. First, what it is to tempt God: Secondly,
wherein: Thirdly, the manner how: Fourthly, this
proposition, <hi>Thou shalt not tempt:</hi> Fiftly, the reason
why we may not: Sixtly, though hee be our God,
and we on the Pinacle, these be no arguments for vs
to presume.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>FIrst, whosoeuer will not vse such ordinary meanes
as God hath appointed, tempteth God: If hee vse
extraordinary, (as here the deuill would haue Christ
do) when no body went about to thrust him downe,
wilfully to haue cast himselfe downe, were great
madnesse: or when a man hath a faire paire of staires
to go downe by, to call for a <hi>Cherub</hi> to carry him,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19855:38"/>
or for the <hi>winde to fly downe, Psalme</hi> 18, 10. were a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>
great wantonnesse.</p>
               <p>There is an humor in man, that wee are all giuen
vnto by nature; to bee meruailous desirous to try
conclusions in matters that are rare and vnknowne
vnto them; contemning things common, and to be
fond after strange nouelties. It was told them as
plaine as could bee, that they should not reserue of
the <hi>Manna till morning,</hi> and they needed not to haue
reserued it; they had <hi>fresh euery day:</hi> and yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
they would needs keepe it, if it were but for an
experiment sake, to try whither it would stinke or
no, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10, 20. And though they were forbidden
togather on the Sabbath day, and on the Eeuen had
enough for two dayes, and it was told them <hi>they
should finde none;</hi> yet they must needs try. When a
thing cannot bee had without great difficultie, it is
our manner to haue a vehement longing after it: as
when <hi>Dauid</hi> was in a Hold, and the Garrisons of the
<hi>Philistims</hi> were in <hi>Bethelem,</hi> then being thirsty, no
water would serue his turne, but that in <hi>Bethelem,
2 Sam.</hi> 23, 15. But when three mighty men had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into the host of the <hi>Philistims,</hi> and had brought
him of it, he cared not for it.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>II.</head>
               <p>FOr the second, we are to know, that where neede
is (as the Heathen speaketh) there a man may
commit himselfe to the prouidence of God, and rely
vpon him. For we haue heard, that where the means
faile vs, God hath yet in store his foure prerogatiues:
therefore when it comes to a dead lift (as wee say)
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19855:38"/>
then to haue a strong confidence in God, is thanke
worthy: and it is the practise and propertie of faith,
to say boldly with <hi>Abraham</hi> when hee saw nothing
present, that euen on the <hi>hill God will prouide, Gen. 22,
14.</hi> When our enemies are behinde vs, and the red
Sea before vs, then to looke for a way through the
Sea, and to expect <hi>Manna</hi> out of heauen, and water
out of the Rocke, is much worth. So our Sauoiur,
when he and his company were in the desert, where
no meat was to be had, fed them miraculously: but
being neere to the Towne where they might haue it,
he dismissed them. When <hi>Elias</hi> was in distresse, and
all meates failed him, then the Angell brought him
meate, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19, 6. When <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Ismael</hi> were in
the wildernesse, and the water in the bottle spent, and
she in great heauinesse, then God comforted her from
heauen, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22, 17. When the <hi>Israelites</hi> were in the
desarts, then they had an Angel to lead them, <hi>Exod.</hi>
22, 20. When <hi>Sydrach, Meshach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> were
cast bound into the fierie Furnace, then God sent
them an Angel to be their deliuerer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3, 25. And
so when <hi>Daniel</hi> was throwne into the Lyons den,
(not when he put himselfe in) God sent his Angel
to stop the Lyons mouth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6, 22. When we are
<hi>deserti in deserto,</hi> and all meanes faile, it is time to
trust in God, as <hi>Iob</hi> did. Our conuersation therefore
must be without couetousnesse, and we must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with those things that wee haue: for hee hath
said, <hi>He will not faile vs, nor forsake vs, Heb.</hi> 13, 5. This
is out of the compasse of tempting God, and this is as
much as the <hi>Psalme</hi> could warrant him to looke for.
Looke vpon it, and you shall see, that it expresseth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19855:39"/>
such dangers, as could not bee preuented by mans
care and industrie. As, <hi>from the snare of the hunter,
ver.</hi> 3. who vseth to lay it so as wee cannot see it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde
it. <hi>Vers. 5. Thou shalt not feare the arrow that fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by day.</hi> An arrow (we know) will reach a man far
off before he bee aware. And so throughout the
<hi>Psalme,</hi> they are things out of our defence, therefore
they had neede Angels helpe: but when wee haue
meanes to helpe our selues, Gods omnipotency is
for the time discharged. <hi>Eutychus</hi> that fell out of a
window by heauinesse of sleepe, was restored to life
by <hi>Paule, Act.</hi> 20, 9. This then is Christs answer. If
their were no stayres, and he must needs go downe, it
were a good Scripture to meditate on.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
               <head>III.</head>
               <p>THirdly, as it is a point of Gods power to helpe
without meanes: so hath hee in his wisedome
appointed meanes: there be degrees, whereby wee
ascend to the effect: they are as a paire of stayres.
Where these are, we must vse them; but when hee
offereth as a strange signe, it is scrupulous and foolish
nicenesse to refuse it. As when God bad <hi>Ahaz</hi> aske
a signe, <hi>Esay</hi> 7, 21. and he would not for tempting
God, he was too precise, he was but an Hypocrite.
<hi>Moses</hi> asked a signe and had it, and God was well
pleased with it. And so did <hi>Gedeon</hi> also, to assure him
selfe of deliuering <hi>Israel</hi> by him, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 6. 36. In great,
weighty, and extraordinary callings, it was allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to request a signe: but, when there is no need, or
when there bee otherwise sufficient, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 1.
where many miracles were daily done before their
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19855:39"/>
eyes, and where (though they had neuer so many
more) yet they would not haue beleeued on him.
Such were the Scribes and Pharisies, that for euery
trifling occasion, they must haue a signe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Thus to grate vpon Gods omnipotent proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
is saucie malepertnesse. For ordinary matters,
there bee ordinary meanes to serue our turnes: and
for extraordinary, there be extraordinary wayes and
meanes reserued, that we need not let fall our trust in
matters corporall. We all confesse there be meanes,
as they which <hi>will not worke, may not eate, 2 Thes. 3,
10.</hi> In warfare there is no victory to be hoped for,
without fight, building of rampiers, and making of
darts and shields, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23, 5. onely in spirituall
matters we thinke to do well enough, though we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
put too our endeauour; wee lay all vpon God,
and trouble not our selues.</p>
               <p>There is but one degree or step in all Christianity;
it is no more but out of the Font to leape straight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heaven; from <hi>Predestination,</hi> wee leape straight
to <hi>Glorification:</hi> it is no matter for <hi>Mortification,</hi>
there be no such meane degrees. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels vs, it
is so high, that we had need of a ladder, in which be
many steps: insomuch, as he puts a <hi>[How shall]</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
step, <hi>Rom. 10, 14. How shall they call on God on
whom they haue not beleeued? &amp;c.</hi> There must be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
on God, beleeuing on him, hearing his word.
There must be ordinary meanes; and there is a lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of practise, aswell as of speculation or contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
2 <hi>Pet. 1. 5, 6 Ioyne vertue with your faith, and
with vertue knowledge, and with knowledge temperance,
and so patience, godlinesse, brotherly kindnesse, and loue.</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:19855:40"/>
If these things be in you, you shall not bee idle and
fruitlesse in the knowledge of Christ: for hee that
hath not these things, is blinde: he goeth blindfold
to the wood, and may chance hap beside heauen, or
step besides the ladder. A great many say as <hi>Balaam</hi>
did, <hi>O let my soule dye the death of the Righteous:</hi> but
they care not for liuing the life of the Righteous. He
we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t but blindfold, he knew not the Angel that stood
with a sword drawne in the way, but would haue
gone vpon it, if his Asse had beene so foolish. A
great many thinke, that presumption in being secure
of their saluation, is good Diuinity. <hi>Balaam</hi> thought
he went well, when hee went on the poynt of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
sword. So, one entised by the flattery of a harlot,
thinkes he goes to a place of great pleasure: but hee
goeth as one that goeth to the slaughter, and as a
foole to the stockes, <hi>Prou.</hi> 7, 22. Those whom it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
God to haue partakers of his kingdome, he puts
them in minde <hi>to remember their Creator in the dayes
of their youth, before the euill dayes come:</hi> hee giueth
them the grace of timely repentance, and suffereth
them not to deferre it till the last cast, and then to
thinke, that with the turning of a pin (as it were) they
shall with a trice be in heauen, with <hi>Elias</hi> in a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde.
<hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>We may in some cases aduise
men to haue great hope that they shall bee saued: but in
no case giue them warrant of securitie.</hi> So, in <hi>Ephes. 5, 6.
This we know, that no whoremonger, nor vncleane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
hath any inheritance in the king dome of heauen. Let
no man deceiue you through vaine words, hee that doth
righteousnesse is righteous, and he that doth vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
is of the deuill. Iohn</hi> 3, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:19855:40"/>Now therefore, to neglect the hearing of the
word, or when he commeth to heare it, to clap down
in his place without desire or mind to beare it away,
thereby to be bettered in his life; and without pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
after by meditating on it, to chew it, and so to
kindle a fire within himselfe, whereby it may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,
and turned into the substance of the minde:
this is to tempt God. So also, to beare a greater coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and make more shew of holinesse, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is in one, is to lay a greater yoake on himselfe
than he need, as <hi>Acts</hi> 15, 10. is a tempting of God.
Againe, hee that sinneth, must looke for euill to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 91, 10. He therefore that sinneth, and yet
thinketh to escape punishment, tempteth God. They
that by often experience haue found, that such and
such things haue beene to them occasions of sinning,
and yet will presume to vse the same againe, tempts
God. And those which set vp their Idols in their
heart, and put the stumbling blocke of iniquity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their face, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14, 3. and thinke not they sin.
such tempt God. He that comes to aske forgiuenesse
of God, and will not performe the condition of the
Lords prayer, that is, <hi>Forgiue others,</hi> tempts God. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
he that seeketh for good of God, and will not
preforme that which he is to do; or doth euill, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to escape scot-free, without endeuouring to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd
or resist it, both these tempt God: and to these
two, may all other be referred.</p>

               <p>THe fourth is, we must not at all tempt God at no
hand: wee must not thinke but God is able to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19855:41"/>
bring water euen out of a rocke, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20, 11. when
there is nothing but rockes and stones: but when
we may hope to finde it, we must dig for it. So when
the soile will beare corne, we must till it. When <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha</hi>
was in a little village, not able to defend him
from the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> he had chariots and horses of fire
to defend him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6, 17. but when he was in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi>
(a strong walled Citie) then when the King of
<hi>Israel</hi> sent to fetch his head, hee said to those which
were with him, <hi>Shut the doore, verse</hi> 32. Christ in the
Wildernesse miraculously fed many: in the Citie he
sent his Disciples to buy meate, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 4, 8. In the
beginning, when the Gospdll was published, there
wanted sufficient men for the purpose: the Apostles
had the power, as appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> 8, 29. that on
whomsoeuer they layd hands, he receiued the holy
Ghost, &amp; was straight able and meete to preach the
Gospell: but after, euery man to his study, 1 <hi>Tim.
4, 5. These things exercise, &amp;c.</hi> We see, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<hi>Paul</hi> was told by an Angel that there
should be no losse of any mans life in the ship, yet he
caused the Mariners to cut the ropes, and to cast
Anchor, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 23, 24, 29, 30, 31, 32. Nay, when
some would haue gone out by boate, he would not
let them: so here Christ answereth, that howsoeuer
Angels attend on him, he may not tempt God.</p>

               <head>V.</head>
               <p>NOw follow the reasons why we may not tempt
God. There be two sorts of tempting: the
one, by ignorance; the other by vnbeliefe. It is the
manner of Surgeons, when they are to dresse a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19855:41"/>
wound, and know not how farre, nor which way it
goeth, to tent it: In the same manner is God (after
the manner of men) said to tempt vs, sometimes to
proue what is in our hearts, and whither wee will
keepe his commandements, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6, 2. as he did the
<hi>Israelites</hi> fortie yeeres. To this end he both <hi>made
them hungry,</hi> and <hi>fed them with Maenna.</hi> We some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
tempt God, as if the arme of his power had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
a wound, or his eye a hurt; as if he could not
helpe or discerne our wants aswell as before, because
he brings vs not water out of the rocke, <hi>Num.</hi> 20, 10.
but such miracles now are not agreeing with his wil,
which content vs. <hi>He will haue mercy on whom hee will
haue mercy, Rom.</hi> 9, 19. And we must not <hi>despise the
riches of his bounteousnesse, and patience, and long suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
which leadeth to repentance, Rom. 2, 4. The Lords
hand is not shortened, that he cannot saue; nor his eare
heauie, that it cannot heare:</hi> because hee doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
vs, <hi>we thinke him like vs, Psal.</hi> 50, 19. When
God holds his peace, we thinke his tongue is cut:
<hi>but I will not alwayes hold my peace,</hi> saith God, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>

But how shall I know this, say men now adaies? as
<hi>Zacharias</hi> knew his wife was with child, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1, 18.
who (when hee would not beleeue the Angel th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

told him so, but would needs haue a signe, was striken
dumb. <hi>Behold thou shalt be dumb till the day.</hi> Here is a
signe for incredulitie: hee had beene as good haue
beleeued without a signe.</p>
               <p>The second kinde of tempting, proceedeth of
ouer-much familiarity, when as we thinke wee may
be hold with God, and that he will take it in good
part, and therefore we will put him to it, (as we say:)
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19855:42"/>
we will try both him and his Angels, what mettle is
in them, and what they can do. We are to thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the name of God, as of a heauie and weightie
thing, that is not vpon euery small occasion to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vp and remoued. We are not to accompt it as a
feather, that we may lightly tosse vp and downe at
our pleasure: and euen so are we to esteeme of the
mercy of God. It is not to be aduocated vpon euery
vaine trifle, for that were to vse God as we are wont
to vse our luglers. Come on, let vs see what you can
do, shew vs a miracle, say they, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7, 11. So <hi>Herod</hi>
desired to <hi>see Christ,</hi> that he might see some miracle
of him, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 13, 8. It is a heauy case when men
stand thus affected toward God: when afterwards,
in <hi>Luke</hi> 22, 64. they <hi>blindfolded him, &amp; bad him reade
who strucke him.</hi> We our selues would not be so vsed,
we could not endure to see our friends vsed so: how
much lesse ought wee to vse God in that manner?
especially, that attribute, quality, or property of God,
which of all others, he would haue to be most mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
that is, his mercy? He must needs take it very
hainously to see that abused, since (of all the rest) he
makes most accompt of it. Howsoeuer he could be
content to serue, yet would hee not be a seruant to
our sinnes in any case, <hi>Esay</hi> 43, 24. especially not to
be made a pack-horse (if I may so say) for our sinnes,
to lay load on, euen till his backe ake. He saith, <hi>Amos</hi>
2, 13. that <hi>he is prest vnder vs, as a cart is prest that is
vnder sheaues.</hi> Let vs not make a dung-cart of Gods
mercie, let vs forbeare him that seruice of all
other.</p>

               <p>THe sixt is, that none of these <hi>Dominum Deum tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
neither <hi>Lord,</hi> nor <hi>God,</hi> nor that he is thine,
are fit arguments to proue, that we may presume vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. The deuill belike had perceiued, that there
was some acquaintance betweene Christ and God,
and peraduenture had said vnto him; You may bee
bold with him, and with his Angels. What? he is
your Father, and (as <hi>Caesars</hi> daughter answered) that
though he forget himselfe to be <hi>Caesar,</hi> yet doe not
you forget to be his sonne. No saith Christ, these be
no good arguments to make one presume. As for
<hi>Dominus</hi> we will all grant (I am sure) there is small
matter of presumption in that. In <hi>Deus</hi> there may be
some more colour: but yet very little. It is no good
dealing with one that is mightier than our selues,
least he happen not to take it in good part, but fall to
earnest, and so we feele the smart. We were not best
to make sport with <hi>Sampson,</hi> least he pull the house a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
our eares, and so make vs pay dearly for our
pastime. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Do we prouoke the Lord to anger?
Are we stronger than he? 1 Cor.</hi> 10, 22. If wee will
needs tempt, we were b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>st tempt with our matches.
There is no dealing with fire, for it will burne all that
toucheth it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1, 7. his Angels and Ministers are a
flame of fire: but <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 29. it is said, <hi>Our God is
euen a consuming fire.</hi> Indeed, if he were like <hi>Dagon,</hi>
the <hi>Philistims</hi> god, hee might be set vp and taken
downe, and we might breake his necke and hands
at our pleasure: but being the strong and mighty
God of hoasts, we were best take heed how we deale
with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:19855:43"/>
                  <hi>Tuum,</hi> what say we to that? Anvngracious childe
might make that an argument of presumption: but
whosoeuer is of any good nature, will make it an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the contrary. <hi>Isaac</hi> was <hi>Iacobs</hi> father, but
was <hi>Iacob</hi> more bold to abuse him for that? No, but
rather more timerous, <hi>Gen. 27. My father</hi> (saith
he) <hi>may chance feele me; and so I shall seeme to him a
mocker, and so bring a curse on me, and not a blessing.</hi> Is
God mercifull? yea truly, <hi>Mercy is with thee,</hi> but
<hi>that thou maist be feared, Psal.</hi> 130, 4. We may not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
his mercy, as <hi>to sin, that grace may abound, Rom.</hi>
6. 1. Is he bountifull and long suffering? We must
therefore the more feare to displease him. When the
Pharisies tempted him, and would aduenture their
soules in seeking a signe, it is said, <hi>Math. 8, 11. Christ
sighed:</hi> and why did he sigh? Because God <hi>sware in
his wrath, that they should neuer enter into his rest, whose
fathers tempted him in the wildernesse. Psal.</hi> 95. What
rest? He doth not meane the rest in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>
onely, but that which shall be in the kingdome
of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3, 10. These two temptations of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
may fitly be compared to those two rockes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
which <hi>Ionathan</hi> was to passe, which are said,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14, 4. to be sharpe. One is called <hi>Borez,</hi> which
signifieth dirt; the other <hi>Seneh,</hi> which signifieth a
bramble, or some sharpe pricke; betweene which, he
and his Armor-bearer were faine to clamber vp,
<hi>ver.</hi> 13. Betweene two such rockes lyeth our way,
that is, <hi>Presumption,</hi> and <hi>Desperation:</hi> therefore bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
is he that so loueth God, that he can be content to
creepe on hands and feete to him.</p>

the kingdomes of the world, and the glory of
them.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the first ouerthrow, wee
had the first <hi>Againe:</hi> and
when Christ ouerthrewe
him then also, yet would not
the deuill leaue then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but he commeth with
his second <hi>Againe:</hi> he comes
<hi>Againe,</hi> and <hi>Againe.</hi> The first
<hi>Againe,</hi> was an argument of his courage and stomack:
this second, is an argument of his importunitie.
The first repulse could not driue him away, nor the
second neither; no, nor this third for altogether:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19855:44"/>
for <hi>Luke</hi> saith, <hi>He departed for a season, Luke</hi> 4, 13. So
that as Christ saith, <hi>Iohn 16, 16. After awhile ye shall
see me, and after awhile you shall not see me:</hi> so saith
the deuill also, <hi>After awhile you shall not see me, and
againe after awhile you shall see me.</hi> Which teacheth
vs this lesson; that it is not enough to haue preuailed
against his temptations twice or thrice, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
secure; but wee are alway to stand vpon our
guard, knowing how the deuill will successiuely, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
turning of a hand, be with vs; and that while wee
liue, we shall neuer be at rest with him: or if hee
tempt vs not, we shall be in as bad or worse case. For
so long as the Lord left other Nations among the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rielites</hi>
to proue them by, and to be prickes to their
sides, it went well enough with them, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 3, 1. but
when they began to liue in some security (hauing for
the most part subdued them) then grew they to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
dissention. It is the greatest temptation, to bee
without temptation. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> had the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Sathan to buffet him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 7 for then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
the pressing of God by prayers. But whether
we ioyne hands with Sathan, or resist him, we shall
be sure he will set vpon vs, and try by faire meanes
what he can do; or if we say nay, yet in the end hee
will weary vs, as <hi>Dalila</hi> did <hi>Sampson, Iudg.</hi> 16, 16. who
because she was importunate, his soule was pained to
the death, and then he told her: or if we will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
in relecting his temptations, giuing him at the
first a peremptory refusall; then he will go another
way to worke, as to imagine some deuise against vs,
and smite vs with the tongue, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 18. he will be
rough with vs. If none of these will preuaile, he will
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19855:44"/>
perswade vs, we must be like other men, and that is as
profitable or pleasant to vs, and then say <hi>Samuel</hi>
what he can, we will haue a King, <hi>I Sam.</hi> 8, 19. And
when we haue yeelded once, then goes hee to fetch
company, and takes vnto him seuen whose spirits than
himselfe, <hi>Luke</hi> 11, 26. So the last state of that man is
worse than the first. Giue but an inch, and he will
take an Ell: if he can get in but an arme, he will make
shift to shoue in his whole body. As we see, if the
point of a nayle haue once made entrie, the rest will
soone in. We see an example of his encroaching
euen in <hi>Dauid, 2 Sam.</hi> 11, 4. after hee had once made
him commit adultery by some meane degrees with
<hi>Bethsheba,</hi> see how he drawes him on from one wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse
to another. She was with child, her husband
being in the seruice of God and the King, was by the
King murthered to hide her shame, and satisfie his
lust. So did he draw on <hi>Peter;</hi> first, he made him
follow aloofe off; secondly, flatly to deny Christ;
thirdly, to forsweare him; and fourthly, to curse
himselfe if he knew him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers note, that the Deuils name
<hi>Belzebub,</hi> signifieth a great flesh Flie, or a master Flie;
flap him away neuer so often, he will still flye thether
againe. So the deuill will neuer cease molesting vs,
till the smoaking flaxe bee quite quenched, and the
brused reed clean<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap> broken, <hi>Esay</hi> 42, 3. First, he twists
certaine small threds together, and so makes a little
cord of vanity, to draw vs vnto him: afterward with
a cart-rope or cable of iniquity, he seekes to binde
vs fast vnto him for starting; either by the v<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>ce of
lust, or of enuy, or at least couetousnesse. But if all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19855:45"/>
should faile, pride is sure to hold; <hi>Oh Lord, I thanke
thee, I am not like such and such, nor like this Publicane</hi>
(a degree further,) <hi>nor like this Pharisie, Luke</hi> 18, 11.
This may be a good caueat vnto vs, that we stand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
vpon our guard, and that we be sure that wee
make strong resistance in the beginning, and breake it
(if we can) while it is but a whip-cord. And to vse
the like policie in a good matter, that the King of
<hi>Egipt</hi> did in a bad; who tooke order that euery male
childe should be killed, to keepe the <hi>Israelites</hi> downe
betimes: and against the succession of temptation,
to entertaine the succession of prayer.</p>
            <p>Now to the matter. The Deuill deales as with a
Citie. In the first, he tels him he must be famished, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he can turne stones into bread. Secondly, he
comes to make a traine of Scripture to intrap him.
Now he comes to the ordinary meanes of dealing,
that is; when men striue about any thing, and both
parties are loa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>h ro yeeld, there will be some parley
of composition and sharing betweene them. So here,
the deuill seeing that hee cannot ouer-throw his
faith, offereth him to compound: and (on his part)
he is content to giue Christ all the Kingdomes of
the world, if our Sauiour (for his part) will but fall
downe, and worship him. The deuill before came
disguised in the shape of a male-content, as that
Christ should be in such hunger. Next, he came in
the habit of a Diuine, and that very demurely, with
his Psalter in his hand. Now he comes in all his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
like the Prince of this world, as he is so called,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 4, 30. He doth not stand pedling with Christ,
but goes roundly and frankely to worke: hee offers
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19855:45"/>
all that he hath, (and that is no small matter) to bring
Christ but to one sinne, that so he might ouer-throw
all mankinde. He comes no more now with <hi>Si filius
Dei es:</hi> for that we see is here left, he would not haue
him thinke on it: he would haue him now, <hi>filius secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li.</hi>
This is called by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the bewitching temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereby men become so foolish, as that after they
haue begun in the spirit, they will end in the flesh,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 3. Where the deuill cannot preuayle, either by
our owne concupiscence, or by his enticings. he will
see what he can do with his Dragons taile, and by
that meanes (say the Fathers) he did more hurt, than
by the other. Secondly, his tayle is said to draw
downe <hi>the third part of the starres of heauen, and to cast
them to the earth, Apoc.</hi> 12, 4.</p>
            <p>We are here to consider: First, the preparation
that the deuill makes, by taking him vp to an <hi>high
hill,</hi> to make the offer, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. Secondly, the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it selfe, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. Thirdly, our Sauiours answer, and
the shield he opposeth to it, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. Fourthly, the
issue of the conflict, the victorie, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. In the
first we are to consider: first, the deuils method: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the place and ground: thirdly, his policie, in
not onely telling what he would giue; but in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof: fourthly, the things themselues which
he offers, which are two; <hi>the kingdome of the earth,
and the glory thereof.</hi>

               <p>FIrst, of his method. <hi>Ephes</hi> 4, 14. we are warned not
to be wauering, <hi>and carried about with euery winde
of doctrine, by the deceit and craftinesse of men, whereby
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19855:46"/>
they lye in waite to deceiue.</hi> Craftinesse and deceit
then, be the instruments which the deuill vseth; hee
brings Christ from the Wildernesse to the Temple,
and from the Temple to the Mountaine, to destroy
the Temple, which Mountaine is prosperity. So in
aduersitie wee vow to God, that we will serue him;
but after helpe, we breake it.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>II.</head>
               <p>SEcondly, the lysts where this temptation was
vsed, was the <hi>Mountaine.</hi> The reason why hee
chose this place rather than any other, is the fitnesse
of it, in regard of the prospect. The wildernesse (we
know) was a melancholy place, and in no wise fit
for this temptation, so, neither was the Pinacle: for
besides that it might haue hindred the working of
this temptation, being the Pinacle of the Temple;
the prospect was not good enough. For though it
were high, yet there were diuers hils about <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
which would haue hindred the sight of many
things. And though <hi>Sion</hi> were a Mountaine, yet in
respect of Mount <hi>Hermon,</hi> and <hi>Lybanus,</hi> it is said to
be a little one, <hi>Psal.</hi> 42, 6. And <hi>Psal. 68, 16. Basan</hi> is said
to be the great Hill. Therefore as good chuse a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
hill, both for height and neerenesse, where
he might behold the whole Land of <hi>Canaan, Deut.</hi>
32, 49. So here the deuill chose an exceeding high
Mountaine, where a high minde might best take
view and contemplate: such, where his horizon
might be as spacious as was possible, and where his
sight might not be hindered by any meane object.</p>

               <p>THirdly, be sets before his eyes, <hi>all the kingdomes
of the earth.</hi> There is nothing so soone entised
and led away, as the eye: it is the Broker betweene
the heart, and all wicked lusts that bee in the world.
And therefore it was great folly in <hi>Hezeehias,</hi> to
shew his robes and treasure, <hi>Esay</hi> 39, 2. as hee was
told by the Prophet: it stirred vp such coales of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
in them that saw them, as could not bee quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
till they had fetcht away all that he had, and
all that his Ancestors had laid vp euen till that day.
It is the wisedome that is vsed now adayes, when
men would haue one thing for another, to shew the
thing they would so exchange: as the buyer sheweth
his money, and the seller his wares in the best man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that he can, each to entice the other (by the eye)
to the define of the heart. It is the deuils ancient
sleight, hee would not go about to perswade the
matter in words, till hee might withall present the
thing to the eye. So he dealt with <hi>Eue, Gen.</hi> 3, 6. First,
he shewed her how pleasant the fruite was, and the
woman saw it. So the cause of the deluge was, <hi>Gen.</hi>
6, 2. that <hi>the sonnes of God saw the beautie of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of men. Achabs</hi> seeing of <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard,
1 <hi>King.</hi> 21, 2. for that it lay neere his house, was the
cause of all the mischiefe that followed. This same
foolish vanity of apparell, (whereof I haue giuen so
often warning out of this place,) comes from hence:
<hi>I saw a fine Babilonish garment, and desiring it, I tooke
it</hi> saith <hi>Achan, Iosua.</hi> 7, 11. So the seeing of the bribe,
<hi>blindeth the eyes of the Iudge, Deut.</hi> 16, 19. So still the
sight of the eye, allureth the heart to desire. The
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19855:47"/>
Heathen man therefore wished, that vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
might as well be seene with bodily eyes: for
then he thinketh, that <hi>Admirabiles amores excitarent
suo.</hi> So if we could as well see that which God hath
for vs, as that the deuill here offereth vs: we would
not regard the deuils largesse. <hi>Moses</hi> and the other
Patriarchs saw him which is inuisible, which had
prouided a better thing for them: <hi>therfore he refused
to be called the sonne of Pharaohs daughter, Heb. 11, 27.
and to enioy the pleasure of sinne.</hi> But you are not so to
take it, as though it were a thing simply ill to behold
such things, or to looke on a cup-boord of plate, or
to stand on a Pinacle, it is dangerous, but no sinne;
especially, it is vnfit for an vnstayed and an vngo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
eye. Therefore <hi>Lot</hi> and his wife were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to looke backe at the destruction of <hi>Sodome,
Gen.</hi> 19, 17. To <hi>Abraham</hi> it was l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>ft at large, without
any restraint; for that he was a man of better ruled
affections. For as there must be one without, to take
view and to entice; so must therebe one within, to
hearken to it, and to condiscend. Be sure of that
within, that it be vpright; and then thou maist the
better looke with that which is without. But euer be
warie, for the tinder of thy nature will soone take
fire. <hi>Iob</hi> said Chap. 31, 1. <hi>He made a couenant with his
eyes: why then should he thinke on a maid? and that he
had not beene deceiued by a woman,</hi> vers 9. <hi>and that his
heart had not walked after his eye,</hi> vers. 7. <hi>Paul knew
how to vse want, and how to vse abundance or plentie,
how pouertie: both to be full, and to be hungry:</hi> he had
stayed affections, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4, 12.</p>

                  <hi>Omnia Regna.</hi> This was no small offer, but euen
all the wealth and honour that may be: two
such things as are most vehemently desired of all
men. So that as <hi>Terome</hi> saith, <hi>Prae auri sacra fama nihil
sacrum.</hi> The desire thereof also is so vnsatiable, that it
is like the dropsie; which, the more liquor is mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
to it, the more it thirsteth; it is perpetuall and
vnnaturall. The lessetime a man hath to liue, and so
needs thelesse; the more he couets to abound. These
two do neuer waxe old; of all vices, gray haires do
neuer grow on these. This is the baite the deuill laid
for Christ, and layes for youth, and mindes lasciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
giuen, he laies a baite on liue flesh; to chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke
natures, hee ministreth matters that may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
their wrath; for melancholie, he laies baites of
enuy: and so for euery one, according to their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
inclinations and humours, such baites as may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
them soonest. Which if he can get them once to
swallow his hooke that is within, it will hold them
sure enough, and by his line hee will draw them to
him when he list; so that hee cares not to let them
play with the line: then though hee go to twentie
Sermons, it is no matter: with an Apple he caught
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> and all their posterity. Well, wee
must be as children, weaned from this world, though
it bring weeping with it. <hi>Psal. 131, 2. Gen.</hi> 27, 38.
When <hi>Eue</hi> was Lady and Mistresse of all the world;
yet, because there was a Godship, a higher degree
than hers, she was not content. Princes, because they
can go no higher by any earthly dignity, aspire to be
Gods, and so would bee accounted; as was said to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19855:48"/>
                  <hi>Herod,</hi> that it was the voyce of God, and not of man.
But, as they that are aboue, can abide to haue no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals,
but will be alone by themselues; so they that
be below can abide no superiour. As when <hi>Saul</hi> was
chosen by lot from amongst the <hi>Israelites,</hi> to be King
ouer them, some wicked men said, <hi>There is a goodly
wise King: nay, I would I were King, I would they might
come to me for Iustice, 1 Sam. 10, 27. 2 Sam.</hi> 15, 4.
Euery one hath this conceit of himselfe, that hee is
worthier to beare rule, than they which are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
not so much as the silly Fur-bush, but it
thought it selfe a fit person to make a King, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9,

the kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> to be restored.</p>
               <p>The diuell did not shew all his kingdome to <hi>Saul,</hi>
when hee was comming from keeping his fathers
sheepe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9, 24. and <hi>Samuel</hi> feasted him: nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Saul</hi> was chosen King, 11, 5. <hi>and he followed his
cattell:</hi> Neither did he shew them to the King, bidden
to <hi>Absolons</hi> sheep-shearing, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13, 24. nor at such
times as Princes withdraw themselues to be priuate,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19855:48"/>
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 6, 18. But he shewes them at such times as they
are in their greatest glory and ruffe, when kingdomes
were growne to the top of iollitie and Maiesty, as the
kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> was in <hi>Salomons</hi> time: and
chooseth such a time, as when they were in most tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
and pompe, as they were wont to be at the day
of the Kings birth or inauguration, <hi>Hosea</hi> 7, 5. Cant.
3, 11. or at a Coronation, or at the receiuing of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours;

1 <hi>King.</hi> 10. To conclude, he sheweth them not when
they are in base estate, but when they are in greatest
pompe, <hi>Acts</hi> 25, 23.</p>
               <p>NOw come we to the second point: to wit, the
Temptation it selfe: <hi>En haec omnia tibi dabo,
verse</hi> 9. Hauing prepared Christs minde (as hee
thought) by shewing him that he would giue him:
now hee comes in with a short and pithie Oration;
<hi>[All this will I giue thee]</hi> Here thou seest all thou canst
wish for; without thee sha'l no man lift vp his hand
or his foot in all <hi>Egipt,</hi> as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said to <hi>Ioseph, Gen.</hi>
41, 44. so as he might make all Captaines, and giue
to euery one fields and vineyards, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22, 7. that
he might say to euery one what he list; <hi>Speakest thou
to me? seest thou not that I haue power to crucifie thee,
or to let thee go? Iohn</hi> 19, 10. that his fauour might
raise a man so high, as <hi>Haman</hi> was exalted aboue all
the Princes, <hi>Hest.</hi> 3, 1. and his disfauour, or the least
word of his mouth quite ouerthrow him, as <hi>Haman</hi>
was, <hi>verse</hi> 7, 8. by picking some small quarrell against
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19855:49"/>
him. But this is not all neither: for the same garish
apparell, wherein many do delight, is contayned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this <hi>Haec omnia:</hi> Not onely embroydered with
gold, but euen gold it selfe, and smels of the finest
scent, <hi>Psal. 45. 8. and</hi> 9. And as for the delights of the
flesh, if he can see any that delight him better than
other: it is no more than with <hi>Dauid, 2. Sam.</hi> 11, 4.
to send for her, and haue her, she was straight at his
command. Neither must any say, it was vnlawfull:
no, not <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> if he loue his head, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6, 17.
He may command what he list; if any gainesay it,
he may dispatch him out of the way: for hee may
kill and wound whom he list, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5, 19. Hee may
command all mens tongues, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14, 10. that they
dare not once open their mouth to speake against
him. Nay, he shall haue all mens tongues and pens
ready to extoll all that he doth, and say; <hi>The King is
like an Angell of God, 2 Sam.</hi> 19. or that <hi>it is the voyce
of God, and not of man, Act.</hi> 12, 22. Why, then to haue
all mens hands, feet, bodies, faces, tongues, and pens:
this may bee well said <hi>All,</hi> to haue not onely one
kingdome, but all: to haue all the power and glory
of those kingdomes: here is euen all the kingdome,
the power, and the glory. He comes not after a pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
manner, he shewes himselfe a franke chapman:
he saith not, that <hi>Godlinesse is great gaine, and a minde
content with his lot, 1 Tim.</hi> 6, 6. and wils him to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with <hi>food and raiment, ver.</hi> 8. He comes not with
<hi>Illae,</hi> which we shall not once behold, till another
world come; and whether there be any such or no,
many doubt. He shewes him a mount that may bee
touched, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 18. he comes with <hi>haec,</hi> that is, with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19855:49"/>
ready money in his hand: he not onely offers, but
stakes downe: And whereas God faith, that in the
<hi>Sweat of our fore-head we shall eate our bread, Gen.</hi> 3. 19.
the Diuell requires no such thing. This is a dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
<hi>Haec omnia dabo.</hi> What say ye now? Shal Christ
take it, or no?</p>
               <p>The Heathen man saith, If a man be to violate his
faith for any thing, it is for a kingdome. Christ hath
here offered him all kingdomes, a very enticing
bayt: but is there neuer a hooke hidden vnder it?
The woman was fine and braue, and had a cup of
gold in her hand, but it was full of abhomination,
<hi>Apoc</hi> 17, 14. So here, for all these faire shewes, if you
will gaine any thing by the deuill, you must worship
him; that is the condition annexed to the grant, it is
no absolute gift, the deuill is not so kinde, as to part
from all that for nothing. It is such a gift as the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
call <hi>Excambium,</hi> that is, Exchange: I will giue
you this, if you will giue me that. But yet one would
thinke it a very large offer, to giue so great a lieu for
so small a seruice; it is but a little externall reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
the bowing of the knee; you may (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing)
in heart thinke what ye list. Well, we may
thinke there was some what in it, that the deuill offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
so much for so little, and yet Christ refused it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Christ had great reason to refuse it: for hee
should haue beene a looser by the bargaine. I will
stand to it, he had beene better to haue yeelded to
either of the two former temptations, than to this:
hee should full deerely haue bought all his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
hee had beene better to haue cast himselfe
downe from the Pinacle. For that which the deuill
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19855:50"/>
here demaundeth in lieu, is as much worth, as both
the glory of God, and the redemption of man. Of
his glory, God saith, <hi>That he will not giue it to another,
Esay</hi> 42, 8. If to no other, then not to the deuill of all
other. And therefore the Angel would not haue a
burnt offering offered to him, but to God, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 13,
16. The Angell would not let <hi>Iohn</hi> fall downe and
worship him, but bad him worship God, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 19, 10.
For hee knew that God was very iealous of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
&amp; stood precisely vpon that point. If he would
not impart this honour with the Angels, much lesse
would hee with the deuill: for there are degrees in
idolatry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 23. It is not so ill to turne the glory
of God into the image of a man, as into birds and
beasts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we looke into the desire that he had
to satisfie his ancient enuy, by the destruction of
mankinde: wee must needs commend the deuils wit,
in making such a bargaine. It had been the best peny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth
that euer was bought. For if we marke how
Christ rateth one onely soule, we may see, how he
that to gaine all the kingdomes of the world, shall
loose his owne soule, <hi>Math.</hi> 16, 26. makes but a foolish
bargaine. Then what rate shall be made of all mens
soules, if one bee worth kingdomes; all which had
beene lost, if Christ had consented to that which the
deuill here requireth: for then hee could not haue
said, <hi>I restored that which I tooke not, Psal.</hi> 69, 4. By his
death he paied the price for the sinnes of the whole
World; he should then haue had a score of his owne
to haue payd, and his death could haue beene suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
but for himselfe onely. If he had fallen downe,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19855:50"/>
and worshipped him: he could no haue sayd, <hi>That
the Prince of this world had nothing to say against him,
Iohn</hi> 14, 3.</p>

               <head>Now let vs apply this to our selues.</head>
               <p>BVt wee will peraduenture say, the deuill neuer
made vs any such offer; and therefore what
needs any dmonishment in this behalfe? But I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
though the deuill come not in person to vs, as
he did to Christ, yet hee comes by his instruments.
When <hi>Balaac</hi> sent to <hi>Balaam,</hi> to come and curse the
<hi>Israelites,</hi> and promised him great rewards, <hi>Numb.</hi>
22, 17. it was not <hi>Balaacks</hi> messengers that spake, but
the deuill vsed them as instruments to speake. So
when <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would haue bought the holy
Ghost with money; the Diuell there in tempted the
Apostles with Symonie, <hi>Simon</hi> was but the trunke,
through which the deuill spake, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Againe, there be some that will say, they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
tempted with Kingdomes: it may well be, for it
needs not, when lesse will serue. It was Christ onely,
that was thus tempted: in him lay a heroicall mind,
that could not bee allured with small matters. But
with vs it is nothing so, we esteeme farre more base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of our selues: wee set our wares at a very easie
price, he may buy vs euen dagger cheape, as we say:
he neede neuer carry vs so high as the Mount, the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
is high enough, yea the lowest steeple in all the
Towne would serue the turne. Or let him but carry
vs to the Leads or gutters of our owne houses, nay,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19855:51"/>
vs but stand in our window, or in our doores; if
he will giue vs but so much as we can there see, hee
will tempt vs throughly, we will accept it, and thanke
him too. He shall not neede to come to vs with king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
one kingdome is too much, what say ye to
halfe a one? <hi>Marke</hi> 6, 23. No, will the diuell say, I
will giue ye halfe of one? If hee would come to vs
but with thirtie pence, <hi>Math</hi> 26, 15. I am afraid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of vs would play <hi>Iudas.</hi> Nay, lesse than so would
buy a great sort, euen handfuls of barley, and peeccs
of bread, <hi>Ezec.</hi> 13, 19. and <hi>Prou.</hi> 28, 21. Yea, some will
not sticke to buy and sell the poore for a payre of
shooes, as <hi>Amos</hi> speaketh, Chap. 8, 6.</p>
               <p>When he commeth then to tempt vs, he may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
a great deale of this that he offers Christ; hee
may strike out <hi>Omnia,</hi> and <hi>Haec</hi> too, &amp; in stead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
put in <hi>Hoc,</hi> and say; Holde, ye shall haue this to
worship me, I will giue ye no more; I feare me wee
will make short worke, and take it, <hi>Hoc aliquid, a</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of halfe a crowne or ten groates, a paire of
shooes, or some such trifle, will bring vs on our knees
to the deuill. Is there a pretie commodity to be h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d?
It makes no matter for breaking faith and promise.
This is that that makes the deuill so good a husband
and thriftie, and to go neere hand: what neede he
giue more, when so little will serue? Whereas, if we
will stand hucking with him, wee might get a great
deale more.</p>
               <p>In this temptation (as in the former) there is both
fire to consume our faith, and a dart to wound our
consciences. The fire is the motion of discontent,
that God is either a poore God, not able sufficiently
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19855:51"/>
to reward those that serue him: or else an vnkinde
God, that will not reward the duties that are perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by those that serue him. By this we come to say:
<hi>Who is the Almighty, that we should serue him? Iob</hi> 21,
15. The wicked are they that prosper and encrease
in riches. <hi>I haue cleansed my heart in vaine, for daily
haue I been punished, Psal.</hi> 73, 12. Then this dart makes
vs weary of well doing; and then followes, that we
will serue the deuill Being discontent with Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
we vndertake the seruice of his enemie: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
nothing but a little falling downe, and then if
<hi>Simon</hi> shall come, and require any vnlawfull thing at
our hands, we are ready (with <hi>Iudas</hi>) to meete with
him, and say; <hi>What will ye give me, and I will do it?
Math.</hi> 26, 15. though it be to the betraying of Christ.
The Deuill here opens his meaning in this Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
plainly, <hi>(that he would haue him fall downe and
worship him)</hi> with a bare and bold face: before, hee
came disguised, and spake in Parables. His meaning
is not when he saith <hi>Dabo,</hi> to giue them; but to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or exchange one thing for another. It is no gift,
but a flat bargaine: men vse not to account it a gift,
except it be without rendring backe either money or
seruice. I he render here seruice backe, he may well
thinke I haue sold my soule for <hi>Hoc aliquid, Math.</hi> 16,
76. He may thinke, as <hi>Esau</hi> sold his birth-right for a
messe of pottage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 16. so hath hee sold his
soule, his birth-right, and freedome: for we were all
bought with a price, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 23. the same great high
Priest redeemed vs all with his blood. No sinnes are
so carefully to bee taken heede of, as these, that haue
annexed to adoration, donation: hee hath <hi>Malum</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:19855:52"/>
with a ioynter. If he should haue cast himselfe downe
from the Pinacle, here is all he should haue had: they
would haue talkt of it, &amp; haue wondred a while at it.</p>
               <p>Well, we must be thus perswaded, that God is as
well able and willing to reward vs for any seruice,
as the Deuill, and better too. It is hee indeede that
reigneth ouer the kingdomes of men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5, 21. and
placeth in them w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>om pleaseth him: but when hee
giueth or disposeth, he giueth indeed freely, exacting
nothing backe againe, vnlesse it be such things, as hee
were to haue without any such gift: such things as are
due of meere right, with out any stipulation or hyre.
<hi>Iam.</hi> 1, 5. The Diuels <hi>Dabo,</hi> is, as Offices &amp; Parsonages
are giuen amongst vs; that is, as vsually sold as horses
in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> But if wee could be content to giue
indeed, let that heroicall minde that was in <hi>Abraham</hi>
be in vs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14, 23. that as hee would not take any

<hi>Bethlehom, Math.</hi> 2, 16. So that <hi>Gregory</hi> might well
say, <hi>Ambitio est vita, cui etiam innocentes nocent,</hi> such
is the vehement desire of a kingdome. So that a great
many would haue made no scruple at the matter, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would they haue counted it a temptatin, but
good counsell: Neither would so haue cut vp <hi>Peter</hi>
as Christ did, to bid him go behinde him, and turne
their backes on him; but they would rather haue
turnd their backes to God, and their faces after Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
<hi>Ier. 2, 27. 1 Tim.</hi> 5, 15. And indeede it must
needs be, that either our Sauiour was vnwise in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19855:53"/>
so good an offer, or else the World (in these
daies) is in a wrong byas.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour (we see) doth not onely refuse the
thing, but also giues him hard words, for making the
offer and motion. For hee doth not onely confute
him here, by saying, <hi>Scriptum est:</hi> but he addes words
of bitter reprehension, saying; <hi>Auoyd Sathan.</hi> Hee
might haue giuen faire words, as he did before: but
here he seemeth to haue left his patience. The reason
why he was more hot in this, than in the former, lis:
for that this toucheth the glory of God, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of mankinde: the former Temptations
touched but himselfe in particular, as the turning of
stones into bread, but for miracle: and the casting
himselfe downe, was but to try God, what care hee
had of him. But this so much toucheth the glory of
God, as he can hold no longer. Also, his longing to
redeeme man, caused the same. Neither did he onely
answer the deuill so; but when his blessed Apostle,
who meant friendly to him, moued him to the like
matter, he rebuked him sharply.</p>
            <p>Two causes there are, wherein Christ is very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest;
one in counsell ministred to him, tending to
the impairing of Gods glory; the other in practises,
tending to the impairing of Gods Church, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2, 15.
there he was not only vehement in words; but made
a whippe to scourge them out. And so in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
it is said of <hi>Moses, Numb. 12, 3. That he was a
meeke man, aboue all the men of the earth:</hi> yet when he
came to a case of Idolatrie, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32, 19. it is said. <hi>He
threw the Tables out of his hands, and brake them.</hi> And
so farre did he loose his naturall affection to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19855:54"/>
and Country men, that he caused a great number
of them to be slaine And so in a case of the Church,
when <hi>Corah</hi> rebelled, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16, 15. then <hi>Moses</hi> wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very angry: for <hi>Glory be to God on high, and peace
on earth,</hi> is the Angels song and ioy, and the deuils
griefe: as on the other side, the dishonour of God,
and dissention of the Church, is the deuils ioy, and
griefe of the Angels.</p>
            <p>Now, besides that he doth in words rebuke him
sharply, hee doth no lesse in gesture also; as by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his backe vpon him, (as it is most like he did, in
saying, <hi>Anoyd Sathan:</hi>) which is such a despightful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
as if that one should offer vs the like, we would
take it in very great disdaine. Which is to vs an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
that as there is a time, when we are to keep
the decill before vs, and to haue our eye still vpon
him, and his weapon or temptation, for feare least vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares
he might do vs some hurt: so is there a place,
a time, and a sinne, that we are to turne our backes on,
and not once to looke at his temptation. In affliction,
patience is to be tried; there resist the Deuill, stand
to him, and he will flie from ye, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4, 7. Here we are
to set the Deuill before vs. But in a case of lust, or fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
desire, then do ye fly from him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 18. So
in 2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 2, 22. we are exhorted to flye from the lusts
of youth, and to follow iustice: there is no standing
to gaze backe on the deuill, and his temptations.</p>

that is, whether the Kingdomes of the earth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19855:54"/>
were his to giue or no, Christ stands not vpon; nor
vpon this, whether the deuill were a man of his word
or no. Indeed, it might well haue beene doubted,
whether the deuill be as good as his word: his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are not <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> as the promises of God
are. We may take example by <hi>Eue,</hi> to whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
that if they did eate of the forbidden fruite,
that they should be like Gods; but were they so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
after they had eaten? No, but like the beasts
that perish. And as true it is, that the Kingdomes are
his. If the Kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> had beerie at his
disposition, we may be sure <hi>Dauid</hi> should neuer haue
beene King; as well appeareth by the troubles hee
raised against him. No, nor <hi>Hezechi as</hi> neither, of all
other he would neuer choose such. We may see his
good will in <hi>Iob</hi> Chap. 2, 7. hee could not onely be
content to spoyle him of all that he had, but also hee
must afflict his body: and so vpon the <hi>Gergashites</hi>
hogges, <hi>Math.</hi> 8, 30.</p>
               <p>The Kingdomes are none of his, but they are
committed to him in some sort to dispose, as himselfe
faith, <hi>Luke</hi> 4, 6. He hath (as it were) an Aduowson of
them, to present vnto them; but yet, not as he there
saith, to giue to whom he list, but to whom he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
God must first put all that <hi>Iob</hi> hath in his
hands, or else he can do nothing. <hi>Abimelech, Iudg.</hi> 9.
and <hi>Herod, Mat.</hi> 2. came to their Kingdomes by the
deuils Patent, they be the deuils Officers. So we see
daily in our daies, that he bestowes Offices, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to Churches. So that as <hi>Brentius</hi> saith, Many
haue <hi>Panem quotidianum,</hi> that cannot come by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobis:</hi>
they come not to it by Gods gift: yet all the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19855:55"/>
interest that the deuill hath, is but to present <hi>Pro haec
vita tantuns.</hi> As therefore it may be true, that in some.
fort they may be giuen him: so yet, not to dispose as
he will. It is God onely that can say so; for his
onely they are absolutely. <hi>The earth is the Lords, and
all the fulnesse thereof, the round world, and all that dwell
therein, Psal.</hi> 24, 1. It is he (the most high God) that
diuided to the Nations their inheritance, <hi>Deut. 32,
8. By him Kings reigne, and Princes haue dominion,
Prou.</hi> 8, 15. He brought <hi>Nebuchaednezzer</hi> to know,
<hi>That the most high God bare rule ouer the Kingdomes of
men, Dan.</hi> 5, 21. He indeede may well say, <hi>Cui volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ero,
doea:</hi> and to whomsoeuer God giueth, <hi>he giueth
liberally, and reproacheth no man. Iam.</hi> 1, 5. The deuill
(we see) exacteth more than the thing is worth, and
straineth the benefit of his grant with vniust coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.
But Christ goes not about to answer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
that way: but by flying ro the Scriptures, as to
his surest hold. Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> prayers, that his
minde may bee enclined to Gods Law, and not to
Couetousnesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119, 36. For there is a medicine
for euery disease, and power as well against this
Temptation of Couetousnesse, as against the former:
the Law of God can as well keepe a man from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse,
as from Desperation: <hi>Heauen and earth
shall passe, but no one iote of this,</hi> Let therefore <hi>Haec
omnia</hi> giue place to <hi>Scriptum est:</hi> marry <hi>Omnia illa,</hi>
which both we now enjoy, and which are layd up
for vs here after, are come to by <hi>Scriptum est.</hi> So
that <hi>Omnia haec</hi> is not all we must care for; there be
things to come (besides these things which wee lay
hands on) farre more precious. Though here be all
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19855:55"/>
the Kingdomes of the earth: yet they are said, to be
shewed in the twinkling of an eye, so cannot the
other Kingdome of exceeding glory. All the power
of all the Princes on the earth, haue not power ouer
one silly soule to destroy it, <hi>Math,</hi> 10, 28. All the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of them, is called but a great big fannes, or pompe,
<hi>Acts 25, 23. Salomon</hi> was the most glorious Prince
that euer was, yet he was not cloathed like a Lilly,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 6, 29. Nor all the Lillies in the field, nor Starres
in heauen, nor the Sunne and Moone it selfe, are
comparable to one soule.</p>
               <p>The Scripture whereby Christ answereth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
is in <hi>Deut. 16, 13. Thou shalt feare the Lord thy
God, and serue him.</hi> If any fantasticall spirit oppose it
selfe against <hi>Moses,</hi> let it be accursed. There is in this
answer two things set downe; <hi>worship,</hi> and <hi>Seruice:</hi>
both which are due to God onely. Couetousnesse
endeth in Idolatry, and fitly is so termed: if Christ
had beene couetously minded, then hee must needs
haue fallen downe and worshipped the Deuill, for
Couetousnesse and Idolatry being ioyned together,
wee would not haue parted from so great a benefit.
Christ hath heere changed a word, which the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginta</hi>
Translator hath; which signifieth, a seruice
with an open testimony. So that, wiil ye know if a
man do b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>leeue? <hi>Hee beleeueth vnto righteousnesse
with the heart, that with the mouth confesseth to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Rom.</hi> 10, 10. Such as glorifie God as well in their
members, as in their spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 20. As S. <hi>Iames</hi>
faith of Faith, <hi>Shew mee thy faith by thy workes:</hi> so
may in be said of feare. You say you haue feare, can
you shew me your feare? If it be not a dead feare, it
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19855:56"/>
is to be seene: as <hi>Dan.</hi> 3, 5. it must be shewed by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
downe, and worshipping. The seruant that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
fell downe and besought his master, <hi>Math.</hi> 18,
26. Do you feare? then where is the outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence?
The inward affection must appeare by the
outward action: Religion is outward, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
I <hi>Kings</hi> 19, 18.</p>
               <p>There be two wayes whereby we may haue traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
with the deuill, either of both will serue his
turne. first, homage: secondly, seruice of the body;
and both these doth God require, euen when we are
in the darke, or in our chamber, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 8, 12. Indeede
might the deuill say, this Mountaine is very open;
but how say ye? will ye be content closly in a corner
to worship me? If ye will not weare my cognisance
on your fore-head, yet yee may take my marke in
your hand; then shutting your hand, no body can
perceiue it. If ye will not take the marke, yet take the
number of the Beasts name, that is, <hi>six hundred three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and six, Apoc.</hi> 13, 17, 18. Will ye do none of
these? What then? Will ye serue me? <hi>Rom.</hi> 16, 18.
Thus ye see what glorious termes hee vseth: but if
one should seeme to do one of these on curtesie, hee
will not be content till he do it of duty.</p>
               <p>NOw let vs see first what it is to <hi>Worship.</hi> It is that
which <hi>Cornelius</hi> did to <hi>Peter,</hi> he met him, fell
downe at his feet, and worshipped him, <hi>Acts</hi> 10, 25.
And that which <hi>Iohn</hi> did to the Angell; that is, he
fell downe before his feet to worship him, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19,
10. It is, when one on the knees doth a bodily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19855:56"/>
I will shew it you in <hi>Dauids,</hi> words: for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell it ye better. When <hi>Michol</hi> scoffed at <hi>Dauid,</hi>
for being bare-headed before the Arke, he saith; <hi>I
will be more vile than thus, and will be low in mine owne
sight, 2 Sam.</hi> 6, 22. A man can neuer be too reuerent
to God: we thinke it a great disgrace and debasing of
our selues, if we vse any bodily worship to God. It
may be said to them, as it was to him, that feared to
do too much reuerence to <hi>Caesar, Hic homo times ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere
Caesarem.</hi> Our religion and <hi>Cultus</hi> must be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered,
and a bare-faced religion: were would not
vse to come before a meane Prince, as we do before
the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, euen the God
of heauen and earth. The foure and twenty Elders
fell downe before him that sate on the Throne, and
worshipped him that liueth for euer, and cast their
crownes before his Throne. The wandring eye must<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learne
to bee fastened on him, <hi>Luke</hi> 4, 20. and the
worke of iustice and peace, <hi>Esay</hi> 32, 17. the worship
of the <hi>Knees to how, Ephes.</hi> 3, 14. and <hi>kneele before the
Lord their Maker, Psal.</hi> 95, 6. Our feet are to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his face: <hi>For the Lord is a great God, and a great
King aboue all Gods, Psal. 95, 2, 3. Iacob,</hi> though hee
were not able to stand, or kneele: yet (because hee
would vse some corporall seruice) leaned vpon his
staffe, &amp; worshipped God, as appeareth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49, 33.
and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11, 21. This must be done as duty due vnto
God, and in regard of those that be strangers.</p>
               <p>SEcondly, what it is to <hi>Serue.</hi> This is to bow the
soule, as the other is to bow the body. For the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19855:57"/>
King to serue and speake kindly to the people, that
they may serue him for euer after, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12, 7. is not
the seruice he meaneth, nor to do all that the King
commands, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15, 15. For God must be aboue
all: and of whomsoeuer a man is ouercome, to him
he is in bondage, 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 2, 19. Wee must serue God
with our sacrifices, but not with our sinnes, nor wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
him with our iniquities, <hi>Esay</hi> 43, 23. We may not
make a dung cart of him, to load him with our sinne
and filth, <hi>Amos</hi> 2, 13. and when he comes againe, to
haue as much more for him.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Onely.</hi>] The Deuill himselfe would grant, that
God is to bee serued, his meaning was, that a man
might serue God, and him too: but Christ saith,
<hi>God onely.</hi> But it may be said, this word [<hi>Onely</hi>] is
not in the Scripture whence Christ citeth this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and so Christ hath added to the word of God:
Indeed, in <hi>Deut. 6, 13. Alone</hi> is not, but in the next
verse it is said, <hi>Do not follow after other gods,</hi> which is
in effect, <hi>God onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Papists aske, where we finde <hi>Onely</hi> in siustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by faith? Indeed we do not finde it, but wee
do finde, that by faith and nothing else we are iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3, 28. and so we may well collect it, by faith
onely. <hi>By grace we are saued through faith: and that not
of our selues, it is the gift of God, Ephes.</hi> 2, 7. And on
this warrant haue many of the Ancient Fathers been
bold, to adde the word <hi>Onely:</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> vpon <hi>Rom.
3, 28. Hilarie</hi> vpon <hi>Math.</hi> 8. and diuers others say,
<hi>Faith onely instifieth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God is onely to be worshipped and serued, and
none besides him. <hi>Zephaniah</hi> prophecieth against
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19855:57"/>
them that serue the hoste of heauen vpon the house
top, and sweare by <hi>Malcham, Zeph,</hi> 1, 5. But <hi>Iacob</hi>
sware by the feare of his father <hi>Isaae:</hi> and it is said,
<hi>They feared the Lord, and serued their Idols also, Gen.
32, 53. 2 Kings</hi> 17, 41. It is the property of <hi>Arons</hi>
rod, that being turned into a Serpent, if the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
turne theirs also into Serpents, <hi>Arons</hi> will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure
the rest, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7, 15. Bring the Arke into the
Temple of <hi>Dagon, Dagon</hi> will fall downe and breake
his face, and though it were lifted vp againe, yet it
fell downe againe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5, 3. The stories beare
witnesse, that the god; of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> would not
come into <hi>Pantho. Samuel</hi> bad the people, <hi>if thuy
were come againe to the Lord with all their hearts, to put
away their strange gods from amongst them, 1 sam.</hi> 7, 4.
If there were any other (beside him) that were able
to helpe vp, wee might haue some reason to serueo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
but since it is her that must helpe vs in all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
we must worship him alone: otherwise, when
we pray to him, he may send vs <hi>to the gods which wee
haue chosen to serue for our helpe, Iudg.</hi> 10, 14. If we
could finde an equall, or a better then God, we had
some reason to make him a partner in his worship:
but if none be worthy once to be named with him,
(so farre is all beneath him,) wee shall offer him too
much disgrace and injury in so doing. It is an emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of gold to haue any other mettall ioyned with
it: yea, though it be siluer; <hi>the sonne</hi> (saith <hi>Malachi,</hi>
Chap. 1, 6.) <hi>honoureth his father, and the servant his
Lord: if I be your father, where is your reuerence?</hi> Whether
we account of God, as of our Lord and master; or
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19855:58"/>
whether wee take him for a father, a man can haue
but one father, except he be a bastard, <hi>Esay</hi> 2, 14. and
so be <hi>Filius Populi:</hi> if for a husband, not two hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
for he is a iealous God, and cannot abide that.
<hi>No man can serue two master; but he must loue the one,
and despise the other; no man can loue God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>

                  <hi>BLessed is the man</hi> (saith <hi>Iames,</hi> Chap. 1, 12.) that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
temptation: for when he is tried, he shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the crowne of life. Christ hath endured the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

let the Angel depart (with whom he stroue,) before

<hi>My grace is sufficient for thee.</hi> So here at last, when

there was no good by him to be done, he leaues our
Sauiour: But yet hee went not away willingly of

a comfort to vs, to thinke we stand not at the deuils
