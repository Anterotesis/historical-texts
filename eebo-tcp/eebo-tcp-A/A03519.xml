            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

perfectly &amp; throughly: and vpon our part, true and liuely faithe in the merites of Iesu Christe, whiche yet is not oures, but by Gods workyng in vs. So that in our iustificacion, is not onely Gods mercie and grace, but also his iustice, whiche the Apostle calleth the iustice of God, and it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth in paiyng our raunsome, and fulfillyng of the lawe: and so the grace of God, doth not exclude y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iustice of God, in oure iustificacion, but onely excludeth the iustice of man, that is to saie, the iustice of our woorkes, as to be merites of deseruyng our iustificacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And to bee shorte, the summe of all Paules disputacion, is this: that if iustice come of woorkes, then it commeth not of grace: And if it come of grace, then it commeth not of woorkes.

            <p>These be the verye woordes of sainct Basill.

Consyder diligently these woordes: without woorkes, by faythe onely, freely, we recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue remissyon of oure synnes. What can be spoken more plainlye, then to saye: that freely, withoute woorkes, by fayth onely, we obteyne remission of oure synnes?

But this proposicion, that we be iustifyed, by faith onely, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without workes: is spoken, for to take away clerely all merite of oure workes, as beyng insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, to deserue our iustificacion at Gods handes, and thereby moste plainly to expresse the weakenes of man, and the goodnes of God, the great infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of oure selfes, and the myght and power of God, the imperfectnes of oure awne workes, and the moste aboundaunt grace of our sauior Christe.

            <p>First, you shall vnderstande, that in our iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion by Christ, it is not all one thinge, the office of God vnto man, and the office of man vnto God.

So that the true vnderstandyng of this doctrine: We be iustified freely by faith, without workes: or that we be iustified by faithe in Christ onely, is not, that this our awne acte to beleue in Christe, or this oure faithe in Christe, which is within vs, dooth iustifie vs, and merite oure iustificacion vnto vs (for that were to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pte our selfes, to be iustified by some acte or vertue, that is within oure selfes): But the true vnderstandynge and meanynge thereof is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we heare Gods woorde, and beleue it: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we haue faith, hope, charitie, repentaunce, dread, and feare of God within vs, and do neuer so many good woorkes thereunto: yet we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the mertte of all our saied vertues, of faith, hope, charitie, and all our other vertues, and good dedes, which we either haue doen, shal do, or can do, as thynges that be farre to weake, and insufficient and vnperfecte, to deserue remission of our synnes, and oure iustification, and therefore we must trust, onely in Gods mercie, and in that sacrifyce, whiche our high prieste, and sauior Christ Iesus, the sonne of God, once offered for vs vpon the crosse, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein therby Gods grace, and remission, aswel of our originall synne in baptisme, as of all actuall synne, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by vs after oure baptisme, if we truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente


<pb facs="tcp:10564:19"/>
and conuerte vnfainedly to hym agayn. So that as sainct Ihon Baptiste, although he were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so vertuous and Godly a man, yet in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of forgeuyng of synne, he did put the people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym, and appoynted them vnto Christ, saiyng thus vnto them: Behold, yonder is the lambe of GOD,<note place="margin">Ihon. i.</note> whiche taketh awaye the synnes of the world: Euen so, as greate and as Godly a vertue as the liuely fayth is, yet it putteth vs from it self, &amp; remitteth or appointeth vs vnto Christ, for to haue only by him remission of oure synnes, or iustification. So that our fayth in Christ (as it were) saieth vnto vs thus: It is not I, that take awaye your synnes, but it is Christ onely, and to him onely, I send your for that purpose, renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cyng therein all your good vertues, woordes, thoughtes, and woorkes, and onely put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng your trust in Christe.</p>
            <p>Thus you do se, that the very true sense of thys proposicion: We be iustifyed by faythe in Christe onely: (accordyng to the meanyng of the old aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent aucthors) is this: we put oure faithe in Christe, that we be iustifyed by hym onely, that we be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Gods free mercie, and the merites of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior Christe onely, and by no vertue or good worke of our awne, that is in vs, or that we can be able to haue or to do, for to deserue thesame, Christ hymself onely, beyng the cause meritorious thereof.</p>

And least any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should be deceyued, for lacke of right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding thereof, it is diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be noted, that faythe is taken in the scripture, two manes of wayes.

And this faith, by the holy Apostle sainct Iames, is compared to the fayth of deuilles,<note place="margin">Iames. ii.</note> which beleue, God to be true, and iuste, and tremble for feare, yet they do nothynge well, but al euill. And suche a maner of fayth, haue the wicked and naugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie thristian people, whiche confesse God (as saincte Paule sayeth) in their mouthe,<note place="margin">Tit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes harte, wherby he knoweth that there is a God, and assenteth vnto all trueth of Gods moste holye worde, conteyned in holy scripture. So that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth onely, in beleuing of the woorde of God, that it is true. And thys is not properlye called faythe: But as he, that readeth Cesars Commentaries, beleuyng thesame to be true, hath thereby a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Cesars lyfe, and noble actes, because he


<pb facs="tcp:10564:23"/>
beleueth the history of Cesar: yet it is not properly saied, that he beleueth in Cesar, of whome he loketh for no helpe, nor benefite: Euen so, he that beleueth, that all that is spoken of God in the Bible, is true, and yet liueth so vngodly, that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not loke to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the promises and benefites of God: although it maye be saide, that such a man hath a faith &amp; belief to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes of God, yet it is not properly saied, that he beleueth in God, or hath suche a fayth &amp; truste in God, wherby he may surely loke for grace, mercy, &amp; eternall lyfe at Gods hand, but rather for indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion &amp; punishment, according to the merites of hys wicked life. For as it is written in a boke, entituled to be of Didimus Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drinus: forasmuch as faith without workes is ded, it is not now faith: as a ded man, is not a man. This ded faith therfore, is not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sure and substancial faith, which saueth synners.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A liuely faith.</note>Another fayth there is in scripture, whiche is not (as the foresayde faith) idle, vnfruitfull, and dead, but worketh by charitie (as S.

Thys is the true, liuely, and vnfayned christian faith, and is not in the mouthe and outward profession onely: but it liueth, and stirreth inwardly in the hart. And this faythe, is not without hope and truste in God, nor without the loue of God and of our neyghbors nor without the feare of God, nor without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> desyre to heare Gods worde, and to folowe thesame, in es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewyng euill, and doyng gladly all good workes.</p>
            <p>Thys faith,<note place="margin">Hebre. xi.</note> (as sainct Paule describeth it) is the sure ground and foundacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the benefites, whiche we ought to loke for, and trust to receyue of God: a certificat &amp; sure expectacion of them, although they yet sensiblie appere not vnto vs. And after he saith: he that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to God, must beleue, both that he is, &amp; that he is a mercifull rewarder of wel doers. And nothyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth good men vnto God so muche as this assured faith, &amp; trust in him. Of this faithe, iij. thinges are specially to be noted. First,<note place="margin">Thre thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are to bee noted of faith</note> that this faithe, doth not lye ded in the hart, but is liuely and fruitful in bringing furth good workes.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Faithe is full of good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</note>For the first, as the light cannot be hid, but will shewe furthe it self, at one place or other: So a true faith cannot be kept secret, but when occasion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, it will breake out, &amp; shew it self by good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. And as the liuyng body of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer exerciseth suche thinges, as belongeth to a naturall &amp; liuyng body, for nourishement &amp; preseruacion of thesame, as it hath nede, opportunitie and occasion: euen so the soule, that hath a liuely faith in it, wyl be doyng alwaye some good worke, whiche shall declare that it is liuyng, and will not be vnoccupied. Therfore, when men heare in the scriptures, so high co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cions of faythe, that it maketh vs to please God, to liue with God, and to be the children of God: if then they phantasie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that thei be set at libertie, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doyng all good workes, and may liue as thei liste, thei tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle with God, &amp; deceyue themselfes. And it is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest token that thei be farre from hauing the true and liuely faith, &amp; also farre from knowledge, what true faith meaneth. For the very sure &amp; liuelye chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith is, not only to beleue al thinges of God, whiche are conteyned in holy scripture: but also, is an earnest trust, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in God, that he doth regarde vs, and hath cure of vs, as the father of the child, whom he doth loue, and that he will be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto vs, for his onely sonnes sake: and that we haue our sauior Christ, oure perpetuall aduocate &amp; priest, in whose onely merites, oblacion, &amp; sufferyng we do trust, that oure offences be continually was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and purged, whensoeuer we, (repentyng truly) do returne to hym, with our whole harte, stedfastly

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and neuer to turne backe again to synne. Such is the true faythe, that the scripture doeth somuche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende, the whiche, when it seeth and considereth, what God hath doen for vs, is also moued through continual assistence of the spirite of God, to serue &amp; please hym, to kepe hys fauor, to feare hys displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to continue his obedient childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, shewing tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Thys true faythe will shewe furthe it selfe,<note place="margin">Abac. ii.</note> and cannot longe be idle. For as it is written: The iuste man doth liue by his fayth.

And God by his prophete Hieremie sayeth:<note place="margin">Hiere. xvii.</note> that he is a happy and blessed man, whiche hath fayth and confidence in God. For he is lyke a tree, sette by the water syde, that spreedeth hys rootes abroode to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the moysture, and feareth not heate when it commeth: his leafe will be grene, and will not cease, to brynge furth his fruite: Euen so faithefull men, (puttyng awaye all feare of aduersitie) wyll shewe furthe the fruite of their good workes, as occasion is offered to do them.</p>
            <p>The Wisema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saieth: he that beleueth in God,<note place="margin">Eccl. xxxii.</note> wil harken vnto his commaundementes. For if we doo not shewe our selfes faithfull in oure conuersacion, the faith which we pretend to haue, is but a fayned

not auailyng to the eternall life. Thei bee but sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and shewes of liuely and good thynges, and not good and liuely thynges in dede. For true faith doth geue life to the workes, and out of suche faith come good woorkes, that be very good woorkes in dede, and without it, no worke is good before God: as saieth saincte Augustine:<note place="margin">In prefati. Psalme. xxxi.</note> wee muste set not good workes before faithe, nor thynke that before faithe, a man maie do any good worke: for suche workes, although thei seme vnto men, to bee praise worthy, yet in deede thei bee but vain, and not allowed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. Thei bee as the course of a horse, that ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth out of the waie, whiche taketh great labor, but to no purpose. Let no man therefore (saieth he) recke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon his good workes before his faithe. Whereas faithe was not, good woorkes were not: the intent (saieth he) maketh the good workes, but faith must guide and order thintent of man. And Christ saith:<note place="margin">Matth. vi.</note> if thine iye be naught, thy whole body is ful of dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenesse. The iye doth signifie the intent (saith sainct Augustine) wherwith a man doth a thyng.<note place="margin">In prefati.

For good deedes bee not measured by the factes theimselfes, and so disseuered from vices, but by the endes and intentes, for the whiche thei bee doen.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10564:31"/>Faithe is it, that dooth commende the woorke to god: (for as s. Augustine saith) whether thou wilt or no, that worke that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not of faithe, is naught: where the faith of Christ is not the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dacion, there is no good worke, what buildyng soeuer we make. There is one worke, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which be al good workes, that is, faithe, whiche worketh by charitie: If thou haue it, thou hast the ground of all good woorkes. For the vertues of strength, wisedom, temperaunce, &amp; iustice, be al referred vnto this same faith. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this faith, we haue not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but onely the names and shadowes of them, (as s. Augustine saieth.) All the life of them that lacke the true faithe, is syn: and nothyng is good without hym, that is the aucthor of goodnes: where he is not, there is but feined ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, although it be in the best workes. And s. Augu. declaryng this verse of the psalme: the Turtle hath found a nest where she may kepe her young birdes: saith, that Iewes, heretiques, and pagans, do good workes: thei clothe the naked, fede the poore, and do other workes of mercy, but because thei be not doen in the true faithe, therfore the birdes be loste. But if thei remain in faith, then faith is the nest and saue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their birdes, that is to say, safegard of their good workes, that the reward of them be not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost.<note place="margin">De vocati Gentium.

You shall finde them full of pitie, compassion, and geuen to iustice, and yet for all that, thei haue no fruite of their workes, because the chief worke lacketh. For when the Iewes asked of Christ,<note place="margin">Ihon. vi.</note> what thei should do to worke good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, he aunswered: this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worke of God, to beleue in hym whom he sente. So that he called faithe the worke of god. And assone as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath faith, anone he shall florish in good workes: for faith of it self is full of good workes, and nothyng is good without faith. And for a similitude, he saith, that thei whiche glister and shine in good workes, without faithe in God, be like dead men, whiche haue goodly &amp; preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bes, and yet it auaileth them nothyng. Faith may not be naked without good workes: for then it is no true faith: and when it is adioyned to workes yet is it aboue the workes. For as men that be very men in dede, first haue life, and after be norished: so must our faithe in Christe go before, &amp; after be nori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with good woorkes. And life maie be without norishment, but norishment cannot be without life. A man must nedes be norished by good workes, but first he must haue faithe: he that doth good deedes, yet without faith, he hath no life. I can shew a man that by faith without workes liued, &amp; cam to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but without faithe, neuer man had life. The thiefe that was hanged when Christe suffered, did beleue onely, and the moste mercifull God did iustify hym.

And because no manne shall obiecte, that he lacked tyme to doo good woorkes, for els he would haue doen them: truthe it is, and I will not contend ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: but this I will surely affirme, that faithe onely saued hym.

For euery Christian mannes worde (saieth sainct Hierome) should be so true, that it should bee regarded as an othe. And Chrisostome witnessyng thesame, saieth: It is not conuenient to sweare, for what nedeth vs to sweare, when it is not lawfull for one of vs,<note place="margin">An obieccion.</note> to make a lye vnto another.

And if his credence bee so muche loste in deede, that he thynketh no man will beleue hym, without he sweare, then he maie well thynke, his credence is cleane gone, For truthe it is (as Theophilactus writeth) that no manne is lesse trusted, then he, that vseth muche to sweare. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, by the wiseman saieth:<note place="margin">Eccle. xxxiii.</note> that man whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che sweareth muche, shalbee full of synne, and the scourge of God, shall not depart from his house.</p>

Wherewith, almightie God was so sore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, that he sent an vniuersall famyne, vpon the whole countrey, whiche continued by the space of three yeres.

Thus the promise, whiche he made moste foolishly to God, against Gods eternall will, and the lawe of nature, moste cruelly he performed, so committyng against God, double offence.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of hys awne deuocion and mynde, which to him seme better, &amp; more to gods honor. Whiche thyng to be true, we be taught and admonyshed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holye scripture, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example of Kyng Saul, who beyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded of god by Samuel,<note place="margin">i.

Wherwithal god beynge displeased high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, sayd vnto the prophete Samuel: I repente, that euer I made Saul a kyng, for he hath forsaken me, and not folowed my wordes: and so he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded Samuel to shewe hym. And when Samuel asked,


<pb facs="tcp:10564:50"/>
wherfore (contrary to Gods woorde) he had saued the cattail: he excused the matter, partely by feare, saiynge he durst do none other, for that the people would haue it so: partely, for that they were goodly beastes, he thought God would be content, seynge it was done of a good intent and deuocion, to honor God, with the sacrifice of them.</p>
            <p>But Samuel, reprouyng all suche intentes and deuocions (seme they neuer so muche to Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, if they stande not with his woorde, whereby we maye be assured of hys pleasure) sayde in this wyse: Would God haue sacrifices and offeringes? or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hys word should be obeyed? To obey him, is better then offerynges, &amp; to listen to hym, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then to offre the fatte of Rammes: Yea, to repine agaynst hys voice, is as euil as the sinne of diuina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and not to agre to it, is like abhominable ydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. And now, forasmuche as thou hast cast awaye the worde of the Lorde, he hath cast awaye the, that thou shouldest not be Kynge.</p>
            <p>By all these examples of holy scripture, we maye knowe, that as we forsake God: so shall he euer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake vs.<note place="margin">The turnyng of God from man.</note> And what miserable state doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequently and necessariely folow therupon, a man maye easely consider, by the terrible threatenynges of God.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10564:50"/>Fyrste the displeasure of God towardes vs, is commonly expressed in the scripture, by these twoo thinges: by shewynge hys fearefull countenaunce vpon vs, and by turnyng his face, or hiding it from vs. By shewyng his dreadful countenaunce, is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed his great wrath, but by turnynge hys face or hidinge therof, is many tymes more signified, that is to saye: that he clerely forsaketh vs, &amp; geueth vs ouer. The whiche significacions be taken of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of mens maners: For men towardes them, whome they fauour, commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly beare, a good, a chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull, and a louing countenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: so that by the face or countenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a man, it doth commonly appere, what wyl or minde he beareth towardes other. So, when God doeth shew hys dreadfull countenaunce towardes vs; that is to say, doeth send dreadful pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, of sword, famyne, or pestilence vpon vs, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth; that he is greatly wroth with vs. But when he withdraweth from vs hys woorde, the righte do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctryne of Christe, hys gracious assistence and ayde, (which is euer ioyned to hys worde) and leaueth vs to our awne wit, our awne wyll and strength: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth then, that he beginneth to forsake vs. For where as God hath shewed to all them, that truely beleue his Gospel, his face of mercy in Iesus christ, whiche doeth so lighten theyr hartes, that they (if they beholde it, as they ought to do) be transformed to hys Image, bee made partakers of the heauenly light, and of hys holy spirite, and bee fashioned to him, in all goodnes, requisite to the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God: so, if they after do neglecte thesame, if they bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull vnto hym, if they ordre not their lyfes,


<pb facs="tcp:10564:51"/>
accordynge to hys example and doctryne, and to the settyng furth of hys glory, he wyll take awaye from them hys kyngdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his holy word, wherby he should reigne in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because they bryng not furth the fruit therof, that he loketh for.

But when we beginne to shrinke from his worde, not beleuing it, or not expressing it in oure liuinges: firste he doeth send hys messengers, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true preachers of his worde, to admonish vs of our dutie, that as he for hys part for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great loue he bare vnto vs, deliuered his awn sonne to suffre death, that we, by hys death, myghte be deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, &amp; be restored to the lyfe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, euermore to dwel with hym, &amp; to be partakers, and inheritors with hym, of hys euerlastyng glory, and kingdome of heauen: so agayn, that we for our partes, shoulde walke in a godly lyfe, as beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth hys chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do.

This state &amp; condicion, is called the second death, whiche, vnto all suche, shall insue after this bodily deathe. And this is that death, whiche in deede ought to be dread &amp; feared: for it is an euerlasting losse without remedy, of the grace &amp; fauor of God, and of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng ioy, pleasure, and felicitie. And it is not onely the losse for euer of all these eternall pleasures, but also it is the condempnacion, both of body &amp; soule, (without either appellacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or hope of redempcion) vnto euerlastynge paynes in hell. Unto this state death sent the vnmercyfull and vngodly richeman,<note place="margin">Luke. xvi,</note> (that Luke speaketh of, in his Gospell) who liuyng in all wealthe and pleasure in this worlde, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishyng himself daily with daintie fare, and gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apparel, despiced poore Lazarus, that lay piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully at his gate, miserably plagued, and full of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and also greuously pined with hunger.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, he cried for comforte, complainyng of the intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable payn that he suffered in that flamme of fire, but it was to late. So vnto this place, bodily death sendeth all them, that in this world, haue their ioye and felicite: all them, that in this world, be vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto God, and vncharitable vnto their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, so diyng without repentau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; hope of Gods mercie. Wherfore it is no maruaile, that the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man feareth death, for he hath muche more cause so to do, then he himself doeth considre.</p>

Thus is this bodiely death, a doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, or entrynge vnto lyfe, and therfore not so muche dreadfull, (if it be rightly considered) as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, not a mischief, but a remedy of all mischief, no enemy, but a frende, not a cruel tyrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but a ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le guide, leadyng vs, not to mortalitie, but to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie, not to sorow and payne, but to ioye and pleasure, and that to endure for euer, if it be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kefully taken and accepted, as Gods messenger, and paciently borne of vs, for Christes loue, that suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red most paynfull death, for oure loue, to redeme vs from death eternall.<note place="margin">Roma. viii.</note> Accordynge hereunto, saincte Paule saieth: our lyfe is hidde with Christ in God, but when our lyfe shall appere, then shall we also appere with hym in glorye.

Let vs repent our syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, amend our lyfes, trust in hys mercy and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and death can neyther take hym from vs, nor vs from hym. For then, (as s. Paul saieth) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we lyue or dye,<note place="margin">Roma. xiiii.</note> we be the Lordes awne.

king Saules subiect, though he wer in great fauor with God, &amp; his enemy king Saule out of gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor. Therfore, though he wer neuer so much prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yet he refused vtterly to hurt the lordes anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. He durst not, for offending God, &amp; his awne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, (althought he had occasion &amp; opportunitie) once lay his handes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods high officer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did know to be a person reserued (for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice sake) onely to Gods punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

Dauid (beyng named in scripture a man after Gods awne hart) geueth a general rule and lesson, to all subiectes in the world,<note place="margin">Psalm. lxxx. and .viii.</note> not to resist their liege lord &amp; king, not to take a sweard by their priuate aucthoritie, against their king, gods anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who onely beareth the sweard, by gods auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, for the maintenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the good, &amp; for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euil: who onely by Gods law, hath the vse of the swearde at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; also hath all power, iurisdiction, regiment, &amp; coercion, as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernor of all his realmes &amp; dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and that, euen by the aucthoritie of god, &amp; by gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces. Yet another notable story &amp; doctrine, is in the second boke of the kynges, that maketh also for this purpose. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an Amalechite, by king Saules awn co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, had kylled kyng Saul,<note place="margin">ii.

<pb facs="tcp:10564:69"/>
that was vpon his arme, to perswade his tidynges to be true. But godly Dauid was so farr fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng at these newes, that immediatly he re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes of his backe, he mourned &amp; wepte, and sayde to the messenger: how is it, that thou wast not afraied, to laie thy ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des on the lordes anoynted, to destroy him? And by &amp; by, Dauid made one of his seruaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to kil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> messenger, saiyng: thy bloud be on thine awne hed, for thy awn mouth hath testified against the, grauntyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou hast slain the Lordes anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. These examples being so manifest &amp; euident, it is an intollerable ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, madnesse, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for subiectes, to make any murmuryng, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, resistence, commocion or insurrection, agaynst their moste dere &amp; most dread souereigne lorde and kyng, ordeined and appoynted of Gods goodnesse, for their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, peace, and quietnes.

Christes doctrine and s. Peters, He ought therefore rather to be called Antichriste, &amp; the succcssor of the Scribes &amp; Phariseis, then Christes vicar, or s.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; liuyng. For we rede, that they both paied tribute to the kyng.

For that ye shal so shew your obedience, it is the wil of God. God will that you be in subiection to your hed and king. That is Gods ordinaunce, Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; Gods holy will, that the whole body of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry realme, and al the membres &amp; partes of thesame, shalbe subiect to their hed, their kynge, and that (as S.

In an other place we also reade, that God commaunded Moyses, to take all the heade rulers,<note place="margin">Num. xxv.</note> and princes of the people, &amp; to to hang them vpon gybbets openly, that euery man might see them, because they eyther committed, or dyd not punishe whoredom. Agayne, dyd not God sende suche a plague emonge the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for fornication and vncleannes, that they dyed in one daye, three and twenty thousande?

Certes, this extreme pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshment appoynted of God, sheweth euidently, how greatly God hateth whoredom. And let vs not doubte, but that God at thys present, abhorreth all maner of vncleannes, no lesse then he did in the olde lawe: and wyll vndoubtedly punishe it, both in this worlde, and in the worlde to come.

            <p>And here are all degrees to be monyshed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be maryed, or vnmaryed, to loue chastitie, and clennes of lyfe.

Luke. i.</note> whiche hath promised to reste vpon them, that bee humble and lowe in spirite. If we bee good and quiete Christian men, let it appere in our speache and tongues. If we haue forsaken the deuil let vs vse no more deuillish toungues. He that hath been a railyng skolder, now let him be a sober coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailoure. He that hath been a malicious slaunderor, nowe let hym bee a louyng comforter. He that hath

been a vain railer, now let him be a ghostly teacher. He that hath abused his tongue in cursyng, now let him vse it in blessyng. He that hath abused his tong in euill speakyng, now lette hym vse it in speakyng well. All bitternesse, anger, railyng, &amp; blasphemy, let it be auoyded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you. If you may, &amp; it bee possible, in nowise be angery. But if you maie not bee cleane voyde of this passion, then yet so temper and bridle it, that it stirre you to contencion and braulyng. If you be prouoked with euil speaking, arme your self with pacience, lenitie, and silence, either speakyng nothyng, or els beyng very soft, meke and gentle in aunsweryng. Ouercome thine aduersaries with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites and gentlenes. And aboue all thynges, kepe peace and vnitie, bee no peace breakers, but peace makers. And then there is no doubt, but that God, the aucthor of comforte and peace, will graunte vs peace of conscience, and suche concord and agreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that with one mouthe and mynde, wee maie glorifie God, the father of our Lorde Iesus Christe: to whom bee all glory now and euer.
