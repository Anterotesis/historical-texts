            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>IT was my chance not long agoe,</l>
               <l>abroad as I was walking,</l>
               <l>I heard two louing Siſters,</l>
               <l>that ſecretly were talking;</l>
               <l>The youngeſt to the eldeſt ſaid,</l>
               <l>why doeſt thou not marry?</l>
               <l>In faith (quoth ſhe) Ile tell to thée,</l>
               <l>I meane not long to farry.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When I was fiftéene yéeres of age,</l>
               <l>then had I ſuiters many,</l>
               <l>But like a wanton wily wench,</l>
               <l>I would not ſport with any:</l>
               <l>Till at the laſt, ſléeping faſt,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cupid</hi> came vnto me,</l>
               <l>And like a Lad that had béene mad,</l>
               <l>he ſwore that he would woo me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then he lay downe by my ſide,</l>
               <l>and laid his armes vpon me:</l>
               <l>But I being 'twixt ſléepe and wake,</l>
               <l>did ſtriue to thruſt him from me.</l>
               <l>But then he ſo kiſſed me,</l>
               <l>as I was kiſſed neuer;</l>
               <l>If he had ne're left kiſſing me,</l>
               <l>I ſhould haue ſlept for euer.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then he hug'd and tug'd me ſo,</l>
               <l>I could not get him from me,</l>
               <l>But I with all the ſtrength I had,</l>
               <l>did thruſt him who came on me:</l>
               <l>For <hi>Cupid</hi> like a Suiter bold,</l>
               <l>did uſe both time and leaſure,</l>
               <l>And in the circle of his armes,</l>
               <l>enchanted me with pleaſure.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then me thought the world run round,</l>
               <l>when <hi>Phoebus</hi> fell a skipping,</l>
               <l>And all the Nymphs and Goddeſſes,</l>
               <l>came round about to ſtrip him,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Neptune</hi> lowred, &amp; would have powred</l>
               <l>his Ocean cup upon us,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Boreas</hi> with his bluſtring blaſt,</l>
               <l>did ſtrive to thruſt him from us.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then limping <hi>Vulcan</hi> he came in,</l>
               <l>like one that had béene iealous;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> follow'd after him,</l>
               <l>and ſwore ſhe'd blow the bellowes.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Mars</hi> call'd <hi>Cupid</hi> Iackanapes,</l>
               <l>and ſwore he would him ſmother;</l>
               <l>Quoth <hi>Cupid</hi> then, did I ſay ſo,</l>
               <l>when thou didſt love my Mother?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Me thought that <hi>Orphaeus</hi> with his Lute</l>
               <l>ſtood at my bed ſide playing,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Pan</hi> too with his oaten Flute,</l>
               <l>did kéepe his Flocke from ſtraying:</l>
               <l>And while that they did ſweetly play,</l>
               <l>in ſuch a trance they laid me,</l>
               <l>That to the pleaſant Fields below,</l>
               <l>I thought they had convey'd me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then <hi>Iuno</hi> and great <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>came marching with <hi>Apollo,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Saturne</hi> came with <hi>Mercury,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>and all began to hollow:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cupid</hi> ran and hid himſelfe,</l>
               <l>and ſo of ioyes bereft me:</l>
               <l>Then ſuddenly I did awake,</l>
               <l>and all theſe fancies left me.</l>

                  <l>Good Siſter, I your counſell like,</l>
                  <l>which ſhall not be denyed,</l>
                  <l>For though that I have alwayes béene</l>
                  <l>ſo coy in outward carriage,</l>
                  <l>Yet being eldeſt, as 'tis fit,</l>
                  <l>I will take place in marriage,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The other Siſter then replyed,</l>
                  <l>quoth ſhe, though I am younger,</l>
                  <l>Yet will I not in love give place,</l>
                  <l>for my deſires are ſtronger:</l>
                  <l>And therefore ſince that both of us,</l>
                  <l>againſt our wills have tarried,</l>
                  <l>Like loving Siſters let us both,</l>
                  <l>upon one day be married.</l>
