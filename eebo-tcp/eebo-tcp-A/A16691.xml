            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For ſo haue theſe matters, vpon the occaſion of the Admonition, growne ſomewhat large at length, as now appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. By my former writing I had ſtirred (as it

It may be, you haue alredie heard ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, of the courſe and behauiour of this people.

For which cauſe, (mee thinkes) I haue reaſon yet ſo much the more to bee confirmed in this choyce of my dedication, ſith ſo, the rather, as by your hand and meanes, this benefit of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering their iniquitie, and making knowne their poiſon, may more readily be communicated vnto many in thoſe parts. And as you are now in the ſeruice of your prince, eſteemed a worthy man to haue the leading &amp; training of ſo many, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the defence of your countrey and of this land, againſt the bodily enemy, ſo may that fauour

be manifoldly greater, which the king of kings ſhall in this ſeruice vouchſafe you, by making you moreouer, as an vpholder and deriuer of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of his truth, into thoſe weake parts of your countrey.

And thus alſo, if in the mids of your weapons (as it were) you ſhal allot your times like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to the preparing &amp; attaining skil, weapons, and ſtrength to fight the Lords battails against your ſpiritual aduerſaries, happy &amp; happy again ſhal you be.

And the labour nowe accompliſhed, I am ſo farre from repenting, that I am in good aſſurance, through the mercie God, of a two-folde benefite to ariſe thereby: the one is, of ſtopping that violent ſtreame of ſeducing, wherein daily ſuch numbers of the yonger and weaker ſorte of Chriſtians are caryed out of our aſſemblies: principally becauſe the zeale of ſuch, being greater then their knowledge, becommeth an apt pray and bootie, for the inſtruments of deceit to practiſe vpon. And this agreeth with the exhortation of the Church,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:6732:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnto perfection, in one liuerie, with theſe ſchiſmaticall ſpirites, that ſo they might purchaſe vnto them, both from magiſtrate and common people equall hatred and auoydance. This booke ſhal by the grace of God, teſtifie vnto all that make any conſcience to diſcerne truth from lyes, that there is as much difference betwixt thoſe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they in their bitterneſſe, woulde thus match together, as is betweene that childe, that in tender affection, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth and laboureth the refourming of his mother, whome hee ſeeth by her vndiſcreete behauiour, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a reproche among women: and him that vnder pretence of the hate of her vncomely behauiour, ſhoulde plucke out her bowels, and forſake her In this my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, I haue cared, as much as I could, to husbande the time vnto the reader, and therfore haue both cut off ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny idle diſcourſes (which the aduerſarie woulde haue drawne mee into) and alſo haue ſo ſounded the matters that I haue delt with, by al the writings, printed or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that are probably vouched theirs, as that, I hope, the godly ſpirit ſhall find me no trifler, but ſuch a ſerious and ſincere diſputer as the weight of the cauſe hath required. I was (I graunt) in compariſon of others, as a woman of too weake a conſtitution to conceiue and bring forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch child: but the Lord hath had his way &amp; purpoſe herein. And as (I proteſt before the Lord &amp; his holy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels) with much feare and trembling, I haue from the beginning applied my ſelfe vnto this worke: ſo yet in the doing thereof (through the mercifulneſſe of my God) I haue bin aſsiſted with much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, and great aſſurance, euen in ſome things, that ſeemed at the firſt, ſo in wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, by Satan, with ſo many intricate folds &amp; knittings, as could hardly or neuer by me (for I ſhame not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my weakneſſe herein) bee brought to any cleare triall and expedite diſſolution.</p>
            <p>Of mine aduerſaries I rather knowe the nature then the number. Although (as it hath beene obſerued) ſundrie among them, from time to time, haue laboured
<pb facs="tcp:6732:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be leaders, and ſo vpon the ſpurre of emulation haue gallopped as hard as they could: yet without all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is none among them that can iuſtly take the garland from <hi>Rob. Browne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">That this ſchiſme may worthily take the name of Browne.</note> His writings doe foreiudge the cauſe agaynſt all his competitors.

Let them not diſdaine (therefore) that he ſhould beare the name, as the father of that familie and brood, which, of late yeares in a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell for the Diſcipline, haue made that rende in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of Englande. But ſome will obiect, that theſe that I name, agree not among themſelues: and therefore cannot be accounted of one familie. I am not ignorant, that they are at oddes betweene themſelues, but yet ſo, as that neither partie will ioyne member-like with our Churches in the woorde and Sacraments. In doctrine I knowe they differ, but diuerſitie of practiſe was cauſe thereof. <hi>Barow</hi> and <hi>Greenewood</hi> nakedly diſcouered their profeſsion, and are priſoners. <hi>Browne</hi> cunningly counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiteth conformitie, &amp; diſſembleth with his owne ſoule, for libertie. They fullie beleeuing, the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to be no Church of God, but vtterly to be auoyded in al things, as his writings haue taught them, made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to ſeparate themſelues at all poynts, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He, though hee haue contriued that cup, whereby he hath thus transformed them, as into beaſts, yet himſelfe taking better delite in humane ſhapes, liketh not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with them into their lot.

Concerning the diſputation of both parties in this matter if I bee asked my iudgement, this muſt I ſay: Browne hath ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrowne the maine aſſertions of his young mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as hee calleth them, in proouing <hi>our preachers to haue a calling, becauſe they bring the woorde: that they preach the woorde, becauſe they beget fayth:</hi> For examples: <hi>in him and themſelues they haue done it, ergo, &amp;c.</hi> And that, <hi>The knowledge of reformation and diſcouerie of Church cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions came firſt to them by their preaching, ergo, &amp;c.</hi> And as they number vp all the euils they can finde in the doctrine and practiſe of our preachers, to prooue <hi>they can doe no good, nor beget faith</hi>: hee contrariwiſe by a full floud of <hi>their true doctrine, and good fruits</hi> (whereof he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a copious catalogue) woorthily quencheth the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious flame of their ſlaunderous tongues. Alſo by the <hi>ſitting of the Scribes and Phariſees in Moſes chaire, and the commaundement of hearing them,</hi> he verie ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that wicked men may preach Gods worde, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch office, charge and calling, ought to be heard. The cauils they make againſt theſe things, are ſuch, as ſhew them wilfully to ſtoppe their eares, leaſt the ſounde of truth ſhoulde ſmite their hearts. In theſe pointes I teſtifie, that <hi>Browne</hi> hath well confuted their furie. But if one for <hi>Barow</hi> and <hi>Greenwood</hi> ſhoulde ſay theſe wordes vnto <hi>Browne, Though they haue well deſerued to bee thus qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and conuinced for their follie, yet not at your handes</hi>: I knowe not what he might well replie: for I am ſure, if they had beene ſo well aduiſed, as to haue preſſed him through all their controuerſie, with his owne bookes &amp;

For as for <hi>Browne,</hi> the maſterworkeman of all their mad building, notwithſtanding that in this place, vpon this preſent occaſion, there want not further matter to decipher him: who maketh his religion alwayes propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to his owne humour and neceſsitie: and ſo hath euer vſed, to propound his owne laſt, to make all his diſciples ſhooes by: yet will I referre the reader to the gathering of the proofe of theſe thinges, out of other places in this booke: &amp; ſpecially (amongſt the reſt) where I lay open his honeſt and well meaning ſubſcription. Onely I will produce a teſtimonie or two of maſter <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons,</hi> who in his life time was bewitched by <hi>Browne,</hi> to his euident vndoing, partly, by fleeing with him into the lowe Countreys, and partly, by ſtretching his purſe ſo wide, to the printing of his booke. In a certaine letter he writeth to one of London thus, concerning the diuiſion that fell among <hi>Browne</hi> and them beyond the ſeas. <hi>In deede the Lorde hath made a breache amongeſt vs, for our ſinnes haue made vs vnwoorthie to beare his great and woorthie cauſe. M. B. hath caſt vs off, and that with the open manifeſting of ſo many and ſo notable treacheries, as I abhorre to tell, and if I ſhould declare them, you could not beleeue me. VVhich becauſe this ſheete and many moe woulde not ſuffice to rehearſe, I will meddle with no particular thing, to declare it. Onely this I teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vnto you, I am well able to proue, that Caine dealt not ſo ill with his brother Abel, as he hath dealt with me.</hi> Againe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ende of that letter, hee writeth thus. <hi>Alſo I would admoniſh you to take heede howe you aduenture your ſelfe to be a meane, to ſpread abroade any of that parties bookes, except it were more tending to the glorie of God then it is. For in the firſt booke there is manifolde hereſie: and the other vpon the</hi> 23. <hi>of Matthewe, is a patterne of all lewde frantike diſorder, whoſe haue eyes to ſee it.

And here perhaps the moſt of his ſect will anſwere that they doe indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſuch thinges in him, and therefore doe alſo worthily ſhunne him for a ſlidebacke. O, but why doe they not withall, forſake the whole courſe, which God hath ſo curſed? yea, vpon the which, he hath ſet from the beginning, ſo leageable a print of horrible ſucceſſe? not onely in the outward things thereof, which were indeede (of it ſelfe) too weake an argument, but alſo in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ruines and downefall of iudgement, to the dayly corrupting of ſound doctrine, euen from worſe to worſe, as I haue ſhewed.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording to Chriſtian dutie, I require you in Gods behalfe, that you will reſolue mee of theſe doubts following, by good euident proofe and warrant out of the worde, as it is your duetie to doe.</p>
            <p>For, where as in doubtes that may ariſe concerning any thing in the booke of common prayer, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face annexed to the ſame booke, by permiſsion of her Maiestie, not onely giueth all men free libertie, but willeth them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the reſolution of ſuch doubts, of the Biſhop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or of the paſtor of the pariſh. I therefore, for the quieting of my conſcience, doe deſire to be reſolued, for he that doth any thing in religion with doubt of conſcience, is condemned,<note place="margin">

            <p>Among the reſt, I will at this time, deale with you, but with two things: the one is, the want of gouernement and diſcipline, according to the rule of Gods worde. And the other is, the abuſe and pollution of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, for want of

But on the contrary, you muſt haue ſworne men, after the inſtitution of the Papiſts, Firſt to go tel the Biſhop, or ſome of his hirelings, or Courtkeepers, &amp; they without admoniſhion, will alone excommunicate, and for money will reſolue by the cannon law of the Papiſts, before we ſee repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and amendment of life. Thus I ſee the commandement of God reiected and broken, through their traditions, which is ſinne.</p>
            <p>And alſo for the Lords Sacrament of the Supper, trial ſhould bee made by the gouernement of the Church, of a ſanctified people, &amp; ſo to be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of Saints, &amp; ſo worthy receiuers, by tryall of their faith and repentance, and by the rule of Gods worde: the other refuſed for their wicked life, vntill they repent, and amend their liues. But in your aſſemblies or Church, from <hi>16.</hi> or <hi>18.</hi> yeeres old, or vpward, all are compelled by lawe to come, though he be a couetous perſon, a proud perſon, a drunkard, a defrauder of right, or oppreſſor, or blaſphemer, which in contempt of God, in his life, and manners, maketh but a tuſh or a light matter of ſinne, and of Gods iudgement for ſinne: of which ſort, are the greateſt number in your pariſh, beſides railers, and liars and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>And nowe I demaund, whether Christians are to ioyne, and partake as one body with them in the Sacrament, being vnrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yea, or no.

Now, that the very preſence it ſelfe of the wicked hindreth not, it is clere, by the ſtorie of the inſtitution of the Supper by our Lord Ieſus himſelf: who would not haue ſuffred that wicked Iudas to haue bene preſent at the celebrating of the feaſt, if the very preſence of a wicked man could haue depriued the reſt of the benefit of the action.

I returne them therefore againe to your better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, proteſting vnto you in the feare of the Lord, that if you examine them in the humilitie of your heart, with a ſimple deſire of the truth, you will ſee and teſtifie, that without great wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g doing to the word of grace, you cannot conclude fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe places, that either we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the outward ioining at the Lordes table, or elſe haue libertie giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs in worldly affaires (as you terme it) to vſe familiar conuerſation with inordinat brethren. For it is moſt certain &amp; euident that in all thoſe places (read

them who will) the precept and admonition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is concerning priuate conuerſation and behauiour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards inordinat profeſſors: there being not a ſyllable ſet downe touching our dealings in publike Churches mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings &amp; exerciſes. But here although your euidence haue thus failed, it wilbe required perhaps at my hands, that I ſet down ſome profes to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, to the ouerthrow of this your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to make my laſt argument the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger: which was, that a particular member hath no further to deal in this caſe than by proces of admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1.

               <hi>Know you not, that a little leauen leaueneth the whole lumpes?</hi> I anſwer, the Apoſtle doth there vrge them to the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of the inceſtuous perſon, but ſtirreth no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to depart from the Church, no not in caſe of ſo ſecure a negligence as the Corinthians had committed. It is one thing, that we being humbled and afflicted at the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous examples of euil me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers amongſt vs, muſt labour to ſeparat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the better helth of the whole bodie: (and this in deed is the purpoſe of S. Paul to teach the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians in that place) but it is farre another thing to ſay as you meane, <hi>That all the ſounde members must ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelues, if the vnſounde remaine vnſeparated:</hi> and of this the Apoſtle there giueth no inkeling, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely had bene neceſſarie, if the daunger to euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber ſhould be altogether ſuch as you pretend. For whereas you vnderſtand the compariſon of the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to be ſuch, as that the remaining of vnſounde mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Church, ſhould be accounted of as great force to infect the whole Church, as the leauen in leauening a whole lumpe,<note place="margin">The likeneſſe is in qualitie, not in equalitie.</note> you are greatly deceyued. For thoſe two things in that caſe, are compared in likeneſſe of nature, not in there equalitie of effecting. Like as you ſhould ſay, the conuerſation of two or three righteous men conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a whole companie, euen as a little ſalt ſauoureth a whole pot full of liquor: we know it were a trueth that you ſhould ſpeake, but if I ſhould therof gather that you make thoſe two cauſes of equall force, in reſpect of their matter, to worke their effect, ſhould I not doe you great wrong? No doubt I ſhould. For the liquor neuer faileth to be ſeaſoned of the ſalt, but it is commonly tried that the greateſt number of a companie remaineth wicked ſtill, notwithſtanding the righteous. Such alſo, if you marke it, is the ſimilitude of the leauen: for the effect of it followeth neceſſarilie in the maſſe of meale: but it is not of ſuch neceſsitie that in a whole congregation all become vnſanctified for ſome. Let the Church at Corinth be an example hereof. If the whole congregation had
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6732:13"/>
bin infected, and ſo vnſanctified, through the remaining of that wicked man amongeſt them, woulde the Apoſtle (thinke you) haue ſtill intituled them, <hi>The Church of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1.</note> 
               <hi>and ſanctified ones in Chriſt Ieſu?</hi> there had bene no reaſon in it. What then (will ſome ſay) to what ende did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle put them in minde of the effect of leauen, when he chalenged them for their negligence? euen to the ende that they being put in minde of the reſemblance that is betwene the nature of leauen, &amp; the wicked, in that both are diſpoſed to infect that which is neere them, might haue more care to vſe all the meanes that God hath put into their hands to auoide the daunger. For as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining with the godly tendeth to the reforming of the wicked: ſo the remaining with the wicked, tendeth to the deforming of the godly, yet doeth neither of both fall out alway neceſſarily, eſpecially vpon a whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie or congregation. Therefore,<note place="margin">Out of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces quoted before.</note> ſeeing a Church is as the bodie of Chriſt, and the ſame bodie conſiſteth alſo of many members, euerie of which is ſo to exerciſe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his place, as that all may concurre to the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and encreaſing of the whole vnto a perfect body, it followeth neceſſarily, that no true member ought to ſeparate it ſelfe, for any cauſe, ſo long as there is life in the bodie, and abiding with the head. For I truſt you wil not ſay that the remaining of a knowne wicked one doth <hi>ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo facto</hi> extingiſh life in the bodie, and ſeparate the ſame from the heade Chriſt. Neither may you thinke to auoide me by obiecting, that you ſeparate not your ſelf from the bodie by going from one congregation to another, in that euerie faithfull congregation, in reſpect that Chriſt is the head thereof, hath this ſame reſemblance of a bodie. For if that be a good reaſon, then Paule ſaide not well to the Corinthians, that,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.13.</note> to addict themſelues ſo ſeuerally to diuerſe teachers of the ſame Goſpell, tendeth to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Chriſt. We knowe well they all helde Chriſt the foundation (vnder which teacher ſoeuer, they profeſſed it) yet in that, ſome choſe Paule with neglect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6732:14"/>
Apoſtles, ſome Apollo, others Cephas, and others held Chriſt, without eſteeming the meanes of teachers, they were iuſtly charged to be in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of ſchiſme, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt they ſo continued. Howe then can they be excuſed, that forſaking the congregation, whereunto through the prouidence of God, by their dwelling, they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and ioyned, doe conſort themſelues with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as the affection of their ſpeciall liking leadeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Howe can they (I ſay) bee excuſed for beeing guiltie of parting Chriſt?</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore (for this time) ſince it is (as I hope) plainly prooued. Firſt, <hi>That the preſence or remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the vnworthie in a Congregation, cannot keepe backe the benefite of Chriſt from the faithfull of the ſame. Secondly, That particular members haue from the Lord no further power &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in caſe of offences than by admonition: and that their chiefe regarde muſt be, by vnitie to prouide for the continuance of the whole congregation, which in this caſe is conſidered as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ. Thirdly, That the practiſing and proceeding of particular members, beyond the limittes of admonition, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſome offences, to depart from one Congregation (where the reaſon of their dwelling requireth them to be) and ioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to another, breedeth ſchiſme, and diuiſion of Chriſt.</hi> It followeth of the firſt point, that you may ioyne with vs: and of the two latter, that you ought not to depart from vs of this Congregation, vnleſſe you will ſhewe your ſelfe to bee a rebellious member to the bodie, and bee found guiltie of diuiding Chriſt. Of which things now I beſeech you, by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, to haue a due conſideration.</p>

Which I prooue wee may and ought to ſuſteine, not ſecurely and careleſſely (as hee taketh mee) but with this condition vnderſtoode (<hi>if wee can-not remoue them</hi>) which I ſuppoſed my whole drift and reaſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing muſt needes haue made you perfect in. So my firſt reaſon is, not as hee hath ſhaped it, but thus: if the preſence of the wicked cannot hinder the celebrating of the remembrance of Chriſt, nor the effectuall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his body and blood to the faithful ones, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may we (hauing faith,) effectually comunicate notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their preſence. But the firſt is true, therfore the latter followeth. Herehence he gathereth many abſurdities and groſſe errors, with bringing in Traitors, infidels, Turkes, Popes to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But he miſrekoned in three points which cauſed him to erre in the ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me. Firſt, in that hee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6732:17"/>
vnderſtandeth mee to ſpeake of a careleſſe communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which he could not haue done, if the Lord had not ſmitten him with blindnes, ſith I afterwards plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what dueties hath bene done of vs before commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating: The ſecond, what I anſwere to your queſtion concerning dueties of vs, that is to ſay particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to do in this caſe, hee receiueth as though I ſpake of the body of the congregation, how it ſhould be caried &amp; ordered in the Sacraments. The third, he putteth an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible caſe, as though Infidels, Turkes, Popes, remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch, ſhould come to our communion. In all which you may ſee him full of that ſame vaine Philoſophie, and Sophiſticall cauilling, which you feared to find in your anſwere. Such is the ſtuffe of his third page, mingled with the moſt odious compariſons and ſpitefull collections that his heart could deuiſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5 But here if he ſay, I haue then pared the queſtion, &amp; made it more particular then it was propounded. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, it was moſt expedient, &amp; for your better inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to vnderſtande, and ſo to vſe your queſtion as it might beſt fitte, and be applyed to the particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a congregation, and ſo of our Pariſh, whereof by your dwelling you ſhould be a member. Beſides, to haue vnderſtood it of a whole congregation, I had no reaſon, becauſe I could not ſuſpect you doubted my iudgement in that, to witte, whether a Church ought to debarre the knowne wicked from the communion: eſpecially (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you might doubt) hee that replied, had no reaſon at all to doubt it, ſeeing what high account I made of the ordinaunce of God in that behalfe. Againe, conſider the buſines is with you, you I ſay, who dwelling in our Pariſh do moſt vnkindly (as we take it) ſeparate your ſelf from vs. On the other ſide you ſuppoſe you haue cauſe ſo to do, till you can be reſolued of ſome thinges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at your conſcience ſticketh. You chooſe to declare your greeuances by writing. In your writing you complayne of lacke of order amongſt vs to diſcerne of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6732:17"/>
and there-hence you require to bee anſwered. <hi>Whither it bee lawful for Chriſtians to ioyne in the Sacraments with vnreformed ones.</hi> Whereby, who ſeeth not, that you propound the caſe for your ſelfe, as though if there can be a courſe ſhewed, whereby a carefull Chriſtian may ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his conſcience to communicate, although ſome wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ones be preſent, and partake in the ſignes with vs, that then you would be content to ioyne with vs, or elſe not. Thus taking the queſtion (whether beſt for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or no, I nowe referre it to the iudgement of all men:) I anſwered vnto it (I hope) cleerely, I am ſure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely. Whereunto if this your leader would haue repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with like affection to do you good, he muſt haue done it, taking the queſtion in the ſame ſenſe. Elſe if hee had nothing to ſay to the queſtion ſo taken, what needed this prodigall expence of time? when as hee might in a worde, haue onely admoniſhed, that I miſtooke the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and ſo an ende. Nowe (to ſtoppe vp theſe ſtarting holes) knowe you, that if in the queſtion, you meane by the worde, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the whole body of a Church or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: I anſwere that they ought to diſcerne of the vnworthy, and ſeparate them to the vttermoſt of their power: and that by howe much the more they are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in this duetie, by ſo much the greater is their ſinne. So that herein I ſuppoſe, you and I differ not in iudgement. On the other ſide, if the worde, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> be taken (as I vnderſtoode it) for particular members of a congregation, as you one, and I another, in this congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or Pariſh, then doe I anſwere, as before I did, which was this in effect, <hi>That wee may and ought to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, and not goe away,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The playne ſenſe of the queſtion.</note> 
               <hi>or with-drawe our ſelues from the Lordes Table, though wee ſee ſome that wee knowe to bee notorious offenders, at the ſame time partake in the ſignes with vs.</hi> This was prooued by the argument a little aboue rehearſed, namely, becauſe <hi>thoſe wicked can-not hinder the celebrating of the remembrance of Chriſt, nor the communicating of his body and blood to vs that come with faith.</hi> My reaſon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6732:18"/>
for that is this. If the preſence of the wicked ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs, that muſt it doe, either ſimply in it ſelfe, or elſe in reſpect of vs that knowe them to be wicked: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe waies can wee bee hindered by them, and therefore not at all. That the preſence of the wicked in it ſelfe hindereth not, I ſhewed in a worde, as a thing which needed no great proofe. And that it hindereth not in reſpect of vs that knowe them (if wee haue borne our ſelues wiſely and charitably towardes them by proceſſe of admonition which I vnderſtoode to bee ſuch as our Sauiour appoynteth) I proue,<note place="margin">

And heere in deede wee growe to the iſſue of that whole controuerſie. I ſay, a particular member ought to admoniſhe, and at length to tell the Church, but not to with-drawe him-ſelfe, though the Church ſhoulde not ſeparate the ſame vnworthy one. You I perceyue holde the contrary, namely that a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar member ought to with-drawe and go away from the congregation in ſuch a caſe. Howe this poynt is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, commeth hereafter to bee ſpoken of.

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 7.</note> If you inferre, that <hi>in this ſort alſo I may goe to Maſse, if I will,</hi> you are wyde. For the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of the behauiour of a member in that body, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is a member, and not in a ſtrange body, whereof it is no member. And ſo it followeth not, that becauſe I holde my ſelfe bound to keepe the vnitie of that liuing body, (whereof I am a member) euen with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience of ſickneſſe and vnſound partes, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may as well ioyne my ſelfe to a ſtrange body, and ſo become a member of Satan.

Now for the arguments which he forceth vpon the Apoſtle, I ſay, he is too bold to ſnatch that which the Apoſtle neuer meant to giue him, and that in two points. For neither doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle affirme, that the eſſentiall fourme of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was violated, nor yet that the foule abuſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, were done by them all. The firſt I prooue thus: When Paule had ſaid, <hi>VVhen you come together in one, this is not to eate the Lords Supper,</hi> immediatly he ſheweth them the reaſon why: For (ſaith he) <hi>Euerie one in eating, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth firſt his owne Supper, and ſo one is hungrie, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther druncken.</hi> Heere is nothing controlled touching the ſubſtantiall fourme of the inſtitution (which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the conſecration and diſtribution of the bread and wine) but onely the diſorder that was among them in diſpoſing of themſelues and vſing it, againſt which he oppoſeth the repetition of the inſtitution, as he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the ſame vnto them before, and that being done, in the 23.24.25. verſes, he therehence deducteth that thing in the 26. verſe, which he would afterwards, and doth apply to their reproofe, euen to the verie ende of the cauſe. Now, neither is that ſame thing any whit of the fourme of the inſtitution, but onely touching the vſe and end, wherevnto they ſhould haue prepared and applied themſelues in that action. Like as the moſt cleere ſtroke of that ſentence, plainely, and onely ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in theſe words: <hi>For as often as you ſhall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, you ſhall declare the Lords death vntill he come.</hi> The things in them diſagreeable to this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be blamed, he declareth to be, that there was of the riche of them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſes</hi> 21.22.28.</note> which reſpected chiefely to feaſt and feede their bellies in that comming together, and made no difference by their behauiour, betweene the holie Supper of our Lord, and ciuill banquettings. Now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtle thus particularizeth theſe offences of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6732:22"/>
the Corinthian communicants, and withall, ſpecifieth nothing to be reprooued in the Miniſters, touching the fourme of the inſtitution: who is he that dares beleeue this preſumptuous ſpirit, who careth not what he faceth vpon the word of God, to mainteine whatſoeuer his corrupt braine hath once conceiued?</p>
            <p>The ſecond point which I ſayd he ſnatcheth, is, that he auoucheth theſe abuſes among the Corinthian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, to haue beene committed by them all. Which thus I refell. To retaine all the Apoſtle his tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, euen as he had deliuered them to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: and yet all thoſe ſame Corinth, to tranſgreſſe them in no leſſe matter, then in celebrating the Lords Supper, are two things directly contrary. But the Apoſtle teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth for them in the firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> 1.</note> therefore he chargeth them not with the latter. That he teſtifieth the firſt, appeareth, where he beginneth with this exhortation. <hi>Be yee follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of me,</hi>

               <hi>euen as I am of Chriſt,</hi> and immediatly ſubioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <hi>I praiſe you brethren that you remember all my things, and retaine the traditions as I deliuered them vnto you.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is manifeſt, that the Apoſtle addreſsing himſelfe to thoſe points, whereof he was informed touching the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely behauiour that was among them at Praier, and at the Lords Supper, firſt confirmeth the minds, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of ſuch brethren, as had ſoundly vpheld the truth in thoſe things, and afterwards deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that, which the guilty ſhould find themſelues repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in. 2. That ſome withſtood that prophane diſorder, &amp; polluted not themſelues with the reſt,<note place="margin">That is, by the like euill beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</note> in their behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our at the Lords Supper, it is neceſſarily inferred vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Paule ſaith:<note place="margin">

               <hi>There were diſſentions among them, euen at their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming together at the Lords Supper.</hi> This is the firſt thing in that matter, whereof he ſheweth his diſlike, but withall, confirmeth ſuch as held the truth, affirming that greater matters then thoſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> 19.</note> yea, euen hereſies ſhould grow among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by which they ſhould be ſo far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being damnified, that contrariwiſe, they ſhould become more manifeſt &amp;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6732:22"/>
famous by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And as the Apoſtle in this verſe voydeth theſe of the feare of that concluſion he had ſet down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to wit, <hi>that they came together not with profit, but with hurt,</hi> pointing the ſame now directly to be applied to that part which gaue the occaſion of diſſention. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doth he therby as manifeſtly declare, that he inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not all the Corinth. in the reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that follow. 3. If they were all alike in this offence, then were they all a diſordered &amp; wicked co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, and ſo (in all mens eyes) ten times worſe in euery point of celebrating the Lords Supper, then the aſſemblies of <hi>England</hi> are, from which notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he laboureth thus with all his ſtrength to draw &amp; hold you. Now, if the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church was fallen wholy to be a groſſe diſordered co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany,<note place="margin">Pag. 3. of his reply.</note> and your leader holdeth plainly, <hi>that open groſſe wickednes breaketh the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> it followeth that they had alſo broken the couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; ſo by flat co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence, could not be a Church of God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paul thus wrote vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which (me think) ſhould be clearer then any candell, to make you ſee your leaders impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy: who bluſheth not, by this meanes, to giue the Apoſtle the lye to his teeth.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2.</note> Hence (as by the way) this may be deducted, which I aduiſe you well to conſider.<note place="margin">The Corinthian Church more diſordred in communicating, then the English aſſemblies.</note> Either the Corinth Church was now no Church of God, nor brotherhood for faithfull men to reſort and keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to, or elſe a Church of far greater diſorder, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming together to the Lords Table, then ours of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of this congregation is, ought yet to be holden a Church of God, &amp; brotherhod for faithful me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to reſort &amp; keepe vnto. But the firſt is falſe, ſaith the ſame Apoſtle in the place laſt quoted, therefore the latter ſtandeth firme, &amp; cannot be denied of any that with the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pareth our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating with theirs.

conuince you. But I returne againe to my former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I hope I haue made it manifeſt, that neither the forme of the inſtitution was violated by the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, nor yet the abuſes committed, were done by them all. And now I ſuppoſe it will not be hard to prooue, that the moſt vnworthie among them did alſo eate the outward ſacrament. Firſt, if thoſe had not eaten the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament at all, they could not haue beene charged with <hi>eating the bread, and drinking the cup of the Lord vnwoorthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, without diſcerning his bodie,</hi>

               <hi>and ſo to their condemnation</hi>: But they are charged ſo: therefore we muſt needes graunt they did eate it. The aſſumption is prooued in the 30. verſe, ſaying: <hi>For this cauſe many among you are weake and ſick, and many ſleepe.</hi> Wherein the Apoſtle by theſe effectes, leadeth them to acknowledge the cauſe, namely, their ſinne, ſuch and ſo as he had propounded it in the 27. &amp; 29. verſes. Whereby behold, and if you will ſuffer the point of truth to pearce into your heart, caſt out that furious ſpirit that ſaith: <hi>The Communion can not be good to one partie, and bad to another,</hi> and acknowledge by this caſe of the Corinthians, that manifeſt indignities may be committed by ſome, and apparant vnworthie ones may communicate with others (when they cannot be remoued) and neither diſanull the ſacrament, nor yet infect or make guilty all the Communicants with their ſinne. Neither doth this place alone affoord this inſtruction for you,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iude.</hi> 4.7.8.10.</note> but euen that place of Iude alſo, where inueying againſt ſuch filthy profeſſors, as whoſe groſſe ſinnes could not be altogether ſecrete in any Church, whereſoeuer they liued, yet doth he graunt it might come to paſſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 12.</note> that they ſhould impudently thruſt themſelues into the Church feaſtes of charitie (wherein alſo the Lords Supper then vſed to be celebrated) though ſo alſo they ſhould be but as ſpots and ſtaines therein. In the which place neither doth the Apoſtle once inſinuate, that the action ſhould thereby be diſanulled vnto them, nor all to be made wicked by their meanes in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6732:23"/>
yea contrarywiſe implyeth (to the comfort of the godly) that they might by prayer through the holie Ghoſt, in the circumſpect obſeruing one another,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſes</hi> 20.21.22.23.</note> keepe both themſelues and others from the contagion of all ſuch. Now I woulde wiſhe you (W. F.) and all of your learning, to fixe your eyes heere a little in the meditating of theſe two places, and amongſt other things bethinke you, what was the cauſe, that neither Paule in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that great diſorder in the Church at Corinth, nor yet Iude in reſpect of thoſe wicked ones, which he calleth ſpots in the Church feaſtes,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9.10.</note> no nor Iohn (that I may touch you vtterly to the quick) in teſtifying that Church to be ambitiouſly vſurped vpon, ouerweyed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore corrupted in the diſcipline, do yet in the leaſt ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, directly, or indirectly, account thoſe aſſemblies thoroughly leauened, or the couenant broken, or yet perſwade any of them to withdrawe from the reſt, and to gather a part. And after you haue diligently ſought and conſidered, it may be you ſhall finde no cauſe but this, namely, that the Apoſtles were as farre from your leaders minde and iudgement in this matter, as Heauen and Hell are diſtant and deuided aſunder. Now againſt his odious repetitions, and ſenſeleſſe collections, I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the plainenes and ſimplicitie of mine anſweres: but where I call our dealings by admonition and labouring for the Church cenſures,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 8.</note> a kind of proteſting againſt the ſinne of the vnworthy: he miſtaketh me, as though I meant, an open excepting againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the Lords table.</p>

Your replier vrgeth me with diuers Scriptures, which he ſuppoſeth, warrant me ſome further proceeding. The firſt is. <hi>Giue not that which is holy vnto dogs.</hi> Inaſmuch as this may be brought to Church aſſemblies, it belongeth to the practiſe of the whole ioyntly, not to a particular member ſeuerally, and alone, like as other precepts alſo of Church gouernement.

The like I anſwere to his other two places out of Timothy. He quoteth Ierem. 1.17.18. If he meant that euery priuate man ſhould take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, as with Ieremies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsion, either for the parts of his duty towards the Church, or the manner of cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe in his place, he ſeduceth you dangerouſly, for ſo euery priuate man may publikely denounce the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God againſt Princes, Miniſters &amp; people, &amp; contend with them all, if they faile in their duty, yea, if they but iudge them to faile in their duty (for I trow he wil not aſcribe to them ſuch ſure reuelations, as had the Prophet) and ſo what ſhould an Elderſhip do in the Church, yea or any other gouernors, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not according to my expectation in any thing, I, &amp; ſo any priuate man may diſanull their doings.

Alas, alas, that euer you ſhould beare your ſelfe vpon ſuch a rotten prop. Conſider now againe the compariſon, and you will euidently ſee the error.

The ſix places of Scripture which you quote, I ſayde doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our priuate conuerſation and behauiour towardes inordinate brethren, and haue not a ſyllable touching our dealings in publike Church meetings and exerciſes. Here he thinking me to lie wide open, runneth violently

When your leader is ſo groſſely ouerſhot in ſuch playne points, it lieth you vppon carefully to conſider, whether the hand of God be vpon him in as heauy a iudgment, as fell vpon <hi>Elymas</hi> the ſorcerer, for peruerting the ſtraight wayes of the Lorde. By this that is ſayd,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 13.10.11.</note> I truſt it is cleere ynough, that the doctrine which he calleth ſo ſeditious, is not mine, but the Lords, and therefore if it haue any ſuch dangerous conſequences, as your replier reckoneth you ſee that his accuſation muſt reach higher then mee. But (alas) how doth it grieue me in your behalfe, yours (I meane) with the reſt of your company? I would (if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God) that you knewe, or could diſcerne rightly, with what ſorowe I am ſundry times affected for you when I conſider (which I doe often) what numbers (as I heare of you) whereof many haue otherwiſe good partes in them, are ſo intollerably abuſed and ouer caryed by that wretched man. For (euen in this) doth it follow (thinke you) that if wee tye our ſelues to this rule of ſorting our company in priuate conuerſation, that then the knot of marriage ſhould bee looſed, the bondes of obedience broken and outward acquaintances quite ſhaken of &amp;c. Is there no meane betwixt theſe two extremities, but that we muſt be either vnnatural or careleſſe? Surely if we ſhould take this courſe in all the Scriptures, wee ſhould make a ſtrange religion by and by; I meane if we receiue ſome generall ſayings of the Scripture, without their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar exceptions and declarations in other places. As for example. <hi>Thou ſhalt doe no manner worke on the ſeuenth day, and thou ſhalt not kill</hi>: what ſhould the ſeruice and ceremonies doe in the Church, or the Magiſtrate in the common wealth, if theſe bee not limitted and declared by other ſpecial places and exceptions?

And thus at length it will fall out, being as from both ſides reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that touching Magiſtrates, parentes, maried folkes, and maſters, the general prohibitions of not eating, nor keeping company, muſt bee vnderſtood of ſhunning the malice of ſinne and ſeducing, yea that our doings muſt be with a kind of mourning, and afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their ſakes, but not forbidding neceſſary dueties, which other bonds of commandements, doe ſtraitly bind vs to. Touching other acquaintances and dealing with brethren, thoſe prohibitions reach not beyond their inward familiaritie, &amp; delightful accompanying, which is euer ſtained with fowle tolerations and neglect of Chriſtian reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

And thus he diſputeth. <hi>What places enforce an outwarde vniting in the Sacrament with the members of Christs body only, the ſame inforce a deuyding or refraining in the Sacraments, from thoſe that outwardly are manifeſt to bee no members of his body: But all theſe places enforce ſuch an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vniting with members onely: Therefore they inforce a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayning and diuiding in the Sacrament from open wretches, which are knowne to be: no members.</hi> I may graunt you this argument in ſome ſort, and yet you are as neere your purpoſe, as you were at the firſt. For if hee vnderſtand <hi>by deuiding and reframing,</hi> the action of the whole body of the Church, then is it that, which they ought ioyntly to execute againſt the vnworthy, and that is nothing to the queſtion: but if hee meane, <hi>this thoſe places which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an vniting in the Sacrament with the members of Chriſts body only,</hi> do by the ſame reaſon command particular me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

that what members ſo euer, ſeparate themſelues from their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall body or Church, the ſame doe ſeparate them-ſelues from the life of Christ thereby: But the firſt is true, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly prooued, by thoſe places I quoted (whereas vnitie and holding together of the members, is made the eſsentiall fourme of the body.</hi>

            <p n="23">23 I ſay, that as corrupt and vnworthy members, can be no cauſe why thoſe that are whole ſhould forſake the body: ſo no open groſſe communicantes, can bee any cauſe, why wee that are faith-full ſhoulde forſake the Church. Your leader makes you beleeue, that you hold not this queſtion. I thinke (in deede) he knoweth not what hee holdeth. But I ſay vnto you, (marke it well, as it lyeth you vppon, for in your ſtanding vppon this poynt, <hi>that particular members of a Church may depart or refraine from the Lordes table, if vnworthy ones remaine there vnſeparated,</hi> it doeth neceſſarily fall out thereupon, that eyther you holde <hi>that particular members may forſake a Church of God,</hi> (which now I perceiue your leader renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But withal I truſt there appeareth good hope of victory to this ſide, when as the aduerſary (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much labour to keepe the aduantage thereof) hath nowe flatly forſaken one of his holdes: and that which remaineth for him to flee vnto, is able to kill him with the ſtench thereof, though no man ſhould purſue him any further.</p>
            <p n="24">24 He foloweth the compariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of a natural body, with the members of a Church. And firſt hee ſaith <hi>that as euery particular me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of a body, may ſhake of the rotten,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6732:31"/>
and yet not forſake the bodie: ſo may euerie particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Church.</hi> This is plaine beggerie: for no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar member of a bodie can doe that of it ſelfe, and if it could, his concluſion therby ſhould make but for ſole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, His ſeconde compariſon is thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded &amp; applied: <hi>As the members of a natural bodie, refuſe to vſe the ſeruice of the rotten ones: ſo ought the members of a ſpirituall bodie, refuſe to communicate in the ſacraments with ſuch.</hi> Euery man that conſidereth what I haue ſaid, ſeeth that he fighteth here with his ſhadow, and not with me, for I imploy no ſuch members in any ſeruice. But to cleare his eyes, it may bee, God ſhall make this a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, when he ſhal giue him to meditate, that it is quite contrarie to his ordinance in the naturall bodie, for the whole members to forſake their places, or to refuſe to nouriſh themſelues in the vnitie of their bodie, becauſe of ſome rotten ones that doe indaunger them. Neither haue his other comparings, any more worthie thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, though too much to bewray his owne vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedneſſe. For whereas he eſteemeth that euerie member of a natural bodie withholdeth and keepeth away blood and nouriſhment from the rotten, it is manifeſt that hee is as ignorant in naturall things, as in diuine. For blood commeth plentifully inough to rotten members, ſo long as they are vnſeparated, onely it nouriſheth them not as of olde, but is peruerted by them to the increaſe of their rottenneſſe. Let him follow this <hi>veine</hi> no longer, if hee haue any wit in his head.</p>
            <p n="25">25 After this, he beareth you in hand, that hee fully ſatisfieth a queſtion, which I ſhould be readie to make in theſe or ſuch like wordes: <hi>VVhat if the Church, or the reſt of the bodie, will not withdrawe themſelues from that dead and rotten member neither will caſt it off, what ſhall one member doe?</hi> To this he anſwereth, Firſt, <hi>That if one member doe caſt it off, the reſt will not be angrie.</hi> Which is the ſame begging he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed euen now. Secondly, that <hi>it is a token, the reſt of the members are not ſo liuely, &amp;c.</hi> which is a verie colde anſwer.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6732:32"/>
If he had ſaide, it is a token, the reſt of the members are dead with it, ſo as you may ſafely depart from them, hee had ſatisfied the queſtion. This he would haue you to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, but he durſt not vtter it. For it is the faſhion of an heretique, to keepe more poiſon in his heart, than he vttereth with his mouth.</p>
            <p n="26">26 The firſt part of his next point is beggerly. That a member cannot forſake one congregation of Chriſt, &amp; goe to another, without guilt of ſchiſme, and forſaking the bodie of Chriſt, I prooued in my firſt anſwere, which yet remayneth vntouched by him. His obiection that <hi>one Congregation is not the whole Church of Chriſt,</hi>

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is an vnlearned cauill. For euery particular Church, touching the knitting together of the members, &amp; partaking with Chriſt the head,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27.</note> through that ſame bodily vnitie, is in the ſame ſort to bee conſidered, as the whole Church, and we can no more forſake a particular Church, and yet bee of the whole, than can a finger forſake his hand, and yet be of the bodie. Take heede therefore vnto your ſelfe: braunches broken off doe ſhortly wither, and after that become fit for nothing but for the fire.</p>

The next is a pretie dialogue of woordes, which becauſe hee made it for his owne recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will not hinder him. His oppoſitions are but his owne vnprooued and vnſauerie ſuppoſitions. How tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he chargeth me therein with diuerſe iniquities, let the godlie conſider my writing, and ſo iudge. Whereas he ſoweth the ſeedes of newe queſtions, to drawe in other diſcourſes, I am not one for his toothe, to nouriſhe them.</p>
            <p n="28">28 He would make you beleeue, that hee prooueth our Church a monſtrous and falſe bodie, ſo that you may hold it ſafe to forſake vs, and this he will do out of mine own words, becauſe (forſooth) I confeſſe it may haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound &amp; corrupt members vnſeparated, yea which we are not able to ſeparate. By which reaſon, if you haue a fello<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But here ought to be no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of deformitie, but of the being of a church. Then he chargeth me to ſay, that it may be <hi>a church of God, though it haue the diſcipline and gouernement of Antichriſt, in ſtead of Chriſts, and that I confeſſe, we haue offices, rites orders, &amp;c. after the popiſh inſtitution.</hi> I know what I haue ſaid, he is readie to ſnatch before any thing fal to the ground. But nowe vpon good cauſe of the queſtion, this I anſwere freely. It may be a true Church of God,<note place="margin">That it may be a true Church of God, though diuerſly corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in doctrine and maners.</note> though therein diuerſe rites be corruptly inſtituted, and the cenſures and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces popiſhly caried and ordered. If you doubt that, I will prooue it thus. <hi>VVhatſoeuer hath the eſſentiall partes of a Church of God, the ſame muſt needes be confeſſed to be a Church of God: But a Church of ſuch gouernement and orders, may haue the eſſentiall parts of a Church of God. Therefore a Church of ſuch gouernement and orders, may be a true Church of God. The firſt part no man that hath vnderſtanding can doubt of. The ſeconde is alſo manifeſt thus: that whereas there are but two eſſentiall partes of any thing, to witte, matter and fourme: the matter of a Church is Chriſt the heade-corner ſtone, and a people who are as liuing ſtones to bee layde vpon him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4.5.6.</note> 
               <hi>the fourme, is the comming vnto him, and beeing builded vppon him by faith</hi>: It is certaine there may be other wants and deformities, where theſe eſſentiall partes are. Now thoſe deformities and wantes may bee both in pointes of doctrine and practiſe, as may plainely bee prooued by examples of the Churches of God eſtabliſhed in all ages.

Of wants and diſabilities in the practiſe of Church gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let vs marke whether they may not be found, euen in ſome Church, which that moſt painefull Apoſtle Saint Paule, laboured ſo plentifully to make perfect: conſider (I ſay) diligently, and you ſhall finde that ſame famous Church of Rome (where not long after Paule died for the teſtimonie of Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.15.16.</note>) ſo weake and defectiue, in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of gouernment, as that they could not ſeparate from them ſuch as preached Chriſt contentiouſly, and with ſo ſpitefull minds againſt Paule, as tended to the cutting off of ſo good and faithfull a guide from amongeſt them. You will not ſay, they deſerued it not, nor yet that the better ſort woulde not doe it, for then alſo their faulte was worſe. You cannot ſay, they knewe it not, or it was ſecrete, for Paule was in priſon, ſo as the knowledge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of coulde not come to him, but by the information of brethren:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.20.21.</note> yea it is manifeſt by the ſame Epiſtle, that the greater number of that Church, did corruptly demeane and carrie themſelues in the ſame. Againe, that peſtilent chaire of ambitious vſurpation ouer the aſſemblies, was crept into the Church, whereof Saint Iohn maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theſe wordes.<note place="margin">3. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9.10.</note> 
               <hi>I wrote vnto the Church, but Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes, who ſeeketh the prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce among them, receyueth vs not, wherefore if I come, I wil declare his deedes which he doeth prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt vs,</hi>

vs of. Secondly it is plaine, that the ſame Church, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then vnable to remedie it: which the Apoſtle ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, by purpoſing a time to come &amp; rebuke him, which needed not (if the Church according to his demerite, could haue chaſtened him.) Thirdly, hee yet intituleth them <hi>the Church,</hi> whereby all men may ſee, the Apoſtle was farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Brownes mind. For he neither inſinuateth, that the Church was now diſanulled by ſuch corruption, nor giueth any caueat for men to withdraw or withhold themſelues from ioyning with the ſame, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had bene neceſſarie, both for that time preſent, and all poſterities enſuing. Conſider likewiſe, what I haue before obſerued vpon the 11. to the Cor. in the 11. ſect. So that turne you which way you will, this ſhall bee ſufficiently proued alwayes, that a Church, that is to ſay, an aſſembly conſiſting of the eſſentiall partes of a Church of God, may bee chargeable of diuerſe other wantes and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities both in doctrine &amp; gouernment, which being ſo, the other bulwarke alſo which your leader had builded for you, to perſwade you boldly to go from vs, is beaten downe to the ground: namely that the failing of any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie point in the publique practiſe of gouernement, breaketh the couenant of a Church. Yeld your ſelfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for here muſt you needes be taken.</p>
            <p n="22">22 But nowe let vs come to applie this ſame generall queſtion to our particular congregation,<note place="margin">The Church of England hath the eſſentiall parts of a church of God.</note> which if it bee tried in the eſſentiall parts aforſaid, ſhall vndoubtedly be found a Church of God, howſoeuer in ſome other things impure and defectiue.

Alſo I haue ſaide before, that we both may, and doe diſcerne of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, and debarre the vnworthie. And I brought places of his owne writings that teſtifie the ſame.

His ſophiſticall fetch in making this diſcipline all one with Chriſts power &amp; gouernment, is bowlted out in another place. To holde the church of Englande to bee without Chriſts diſcipline, is they vnaduiſednes of him that putteth all vpon the ſpurre, and neuer looketh at his way. To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the worthy and vnworthy in the aſſemblies: to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the inordinate, to ſuſpend &amp; finally excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the vnruly ones (which is the diſcipline wherof our queſtion is) all men know the church of England by law profeſſeth and dayly practiſeth: therefore it cannot bee ſaid to be without the very diſcipline of Chriſt: this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcipline (I ſay as touching all the parts and duties of cenſuring, although not ordered &amp; adminiſtred by ſuch a courſe as the worde appointeth. Which if he conſider better,<note place="margin">The Church of England not without the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: but doth adminiſter the ſame in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt courſe.</note> hee may more truely hereafter affirme, that the church of England adminiſtreth the diſcipline corruptly, then that it wanteth the ſame: &amp; that the outward forme and ordering of the diſcipline is popiſh, but not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſo. How much we labor according to our places, to recouer that libertie the word giueth to euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for executing the diſcipline, as it is vnpoſsible for you to report of it, that come not among vs: ſo it is a ſhame for him to define of it, that otherwiſe knoweth vs not.</p>

Your leader therefore, hauing ſuch a particular feeling of ſo great a charge and bond of duty, to venture his liuing &amp; life in this caſe (and ſpecially hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the diſcipline ſo deare aboue vs, as he pretendeth) cannot keepe backe himſelfe in this caſe, but with ranke cowardlineſſe, and being guiltie of betraying the good

            <p n="31">31 In my firſt anſwere, I ſhewed you the right vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of that compariſon of the leauen which S.

I gaue you to vnderſtande, that the compariſon is there of qualitie, not of quantitie. I ſpeake not of like force and like nature, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of like woorking. I knowe we conſider of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of things by their effects, and therefore I ſaide alſo, that <hi>Paule putteth vs in minde of the effect of leauen.</hi> The leauen in ſowring the meale wherwith it is mingled, and the vngodly in corrupting thoſe with whom they keepe companie, haue herein both a like nature, yea and their effectes when they doe come to paſſe, are both alike.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6732:35"/>
were not ſo, the effect is like to the ſowring of the meale, which before was not ſo: but now the meaſure of working of the one, and of the other, is not the ſame in both ſubiects. Which that I may helpe you the better to vnderſtand, conſider that the matter ſubiect to the ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the leauen is meale, a thing altogether and wholy diſpoſed to receiue the impreſsion thereof without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. But the matter whereon the wicked doe worke (in this compariſon is a company conſiſting of two ſorts of men, contrarily diſpoſed and tempered, the one apt to be infected, &amp; the other hauing a ſupernatural power to hold out their contagion. So that though the ſowring that the one maketh, &amp; the corrupting that the other worketh, be alike, yet are they not equal. For of the meale, all is infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but not all of ſuch a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie, and ſo is it in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon that I gaue you.

But the Apoſtle cleereth the firſt in many places of thoſe his Epiſtles, ſo as (I hope) no man will aske me particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar proofes thereof: therefore the latter muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be graunted of all ſides.

Your leader ſayth, <hi>He was not conuinced:</hi> belike, he had vowed the number of fiue, and ſo this muſt fill vp tale.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6732:38"/>
I meane that Heretick is taken. Fifthly, he ſayth, <hi>They refuſed not to ſeuer him, but onely neglected it.</hi> Yes, it muſt be ſayd (except when we ſpeake fauourably) that <hi>they,</hi> in effect, <hi>refuſed to ſeuer him,</hi> elſe could there haue beene no iuſt complaynt made agaynſt them to the Apoſtle. They refuſed perhaps not in playne words, but in len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the deafe eare to the complaynings, and ſecurely neglecting the meanes of theyr healthie ſtate. Howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it was, in ſuch ſort it ſeemes to be, as that they that infourmed it to <hi>Paule,</hi> had no hope elſe to get reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.

Thus you ſee, what extremities error bringeth you into, when it is traced out to the end. If you take the comparing of the wicked, with leauen to be in quantitie, that is, that the Apoſtle ſhould vnderſtand the wicked to haue as thorow power and force, to make wicked a whole Church, being ſuffered amongſt them, as hath leauen to make ſowre a whole maſſe of meale, in which it lyeth: then was the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church now leauened throughout, and conſequently, become no Church of God, when <hi>Paule</hi> wrote his firſt Epiſtle.</p>
            <p n="32">32 Of all the other cauils of your leader, at my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the compariſon of leauen, becauſe (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) you are little capable of them, and they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily iudged by all that haue ſome giftes of learning (both as concerning my ſpeeche, wherein he hunteth for contrarietie, and alſo my Logick, which he told you <hi>would not fadge.</hi>) I aunſwere heere no further, but free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue it vp to the verdict of the godly learned.

For this cauſe do I ſo direct and proſecute my admonition to the followers of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</hi> as that the firſt place conteineth their errours in proper from <hi>Glouer,</hi> and the ſecond, ſuch as they haue in common from <hi>Browne.</hi> In which laſt part, as I make their caſe all alike, ſo by the firſt, I do manifeſtly diſſort them. Alike is their condition in this, that they both haue forſaken the brotherhood of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for the matter of diſcipline, and therein hold of <hi>Browne</hi>; and againe vnlike in this, that ſome of them onely, in their wilde wandring, meete with the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie iudgement of God vnto Apoſtacie. Which hard eſtate of theirs, beeing ſhewed in the firſt part of the admonition (leaſt they ſhould thinke themſelues ſafe, hauing gotten out of <hi>Glouers</hi> briars, to lye out ſtill wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring with the diſperſed companies of <hi>Browne</hi>) the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part therefore declareth the euils that haue come vnto them by him, and that in the eares of all his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers alſo, if ſo be the Lord would vouchſafe vnto any of them likewiſe the grace of a happy conuerſion. Neither is the handling heereof ſo obſcurely caried, but that any of wiſedome might eaſily perceiue it: firſt, let the tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the former to the latter part be conſidered, which is in theſe words, immediatly after <hi>Glouers</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies were committed to their conſideration. <hi>But now to come vnto the man that firſt led you out into the wilde feeld of errour, are you made wiſer by him, &amp;c.</hi> This (I ſay) doth ſhew, that now only I went about to remember them of ſuch things as they were directly abuſed in by <hi>Browne,</hi> the firſt author or beginner of their danger. And therfore it alſo argueth, by the proportionable law of contraries, that <hi>Brownes</hi> cauſe, &amp; the venome they had receiued by him, was not touched at all in the firſt part. Secondly, dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion, after I had proued the iſſues of both their waies to be euil, I gathered the ſumme in this ſort. <hi>Now therefore beloued in Chriſt Ieſu, ſith your going out with this man hath had ſo hard euent in many of you, as to bring you

Becauſe ſome men haue frenſies through extremitie of feuers, doth he that ſayth ſuch frantick men are feueriſh, conclude on the contrarie that all feueriſh men are franticke? let no man therefore whome God hath kept cleere from ſpirituall frenſies (which corrupt the true vſe of reaſon, no leſſe than the bodely) yeeld captiue theyr ſenſes and vnderſtanding to ſo immodeſt a man as <hi>Browne,</hi> that he in this tempeſt of his diſturbed and ſtormie affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſhould by ſo lewd a libell, transforme them (as it were) into his iudgement. And this I meane, not onely touching the iniquitie that he chargeth me withall, for ioyning in ſome ſort, his company with <hi>Glouers,</hi> but for the other points of my admonition alſo, which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his ſeduced ones beleeue, to be falſe &amp; ſlanderous.

Secondly, where hee ſayth. <hi>The vnregenerate part is condemned, though the man bee iustified in Chriſt,</hi> it is all a like abſurde, but much more dangerous. The abſurdity that it hath equall with the former, is in this, that if his phraſe of ſpeech bee graunted ſound, yet the diſtinction he offreth thereby, is in deed no diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a playne axiomaticall contradiction.

Plentifull confirmation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of haue wee in the Scriptures, from the practiſe of the Lordes chiefe inſtrumentes, in the planting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourming of his Churches. Thoſe three thouſand ſoules, that were gayned at one proſperous preaching of Peter,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41.42.44.45.46.47.</note> may not bee denyed the name of a Church of GOD, ſith of thoſe things, that are there recorded to bee done of them, ſome are onely proper to a Church, and haue no place at all in other meetings. For theſe being nowe baptized, are ſaide to haue <hi>continued in the dayly exerciſe of the worde, prayer, thankeſgiuing, breaking of breade, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of their ſubstance.</hi> Nowe if the cenſuring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in queſtion, had bene eſſentiall to their beeing of a Church, ſo as without it they coulde not haue done thoſe thinges which onely perteyned to a Church, as the Apoſtle woulde firſt haue bene mindfull to eſtabliſh the ſame, ſo the holy Ghoſt would not haue failed the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe thereof, eſpecially addreſsing himſelfe in that ſtorie, to deſcribe the memorable beginnings and framings of the Churches, as a patterne in ſuch caſes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all ages enſuing. Therefore whereas the holie Ghoſt, voucheth it a Church, apt to exerciſe the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whoſe very being it defineth by the onely ioynt <hi>and willing receiuing of Chriſt Ieſus,</hi>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6732:46"/>
accounteth not of diſcipline as a thing without which, thoſe conuerts could not be made a viſible Church. The like is of the congregation in Samaria, Act. 8.5.6. and 12. called a Church of God. cap. 9.31. The maner of Paule, Barnabas, and others in the planting of the Churches at Antioch, Iconium, and Lyſtra,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 11.20.21.26 <hi>Act.</hi> 13·43.48. <hi>Cap.</hi> 14.1.21.22.23.</note> doe yet further enlighten this that I haue ſaid in the other. For, firſt they gathered congregations vnto Chriſt by the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in thoſe cities, after that as they found them growne to a fitneſſe, at other returnes vnto them, they furniſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Elders orderly elected among them. This their order (I ſay) declareth, that the erecting of diſcipline and ordeyning of Elders therefore, doth not make a Church of Chriſt: for that if the Apoſtles had ſo iudged, they would neuer haue deferred the eſtabliſhing of it, to times after the gathering and planting of them. Yet further to confirme this thing, Paule writing thus to Titus: <hi>for this cauſe left I thee in Creta,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5.</note> 
                  <hi>that thou ſhouldeſt redreſſe the things remayning, and appoynt Elders in euerie Citie, as I commaunded thee,</hi> teacheth vs, both that the Apoſtles gathered Churches without this diſcipline, and alſo helde them in the accounte of the Churches, before that was added to them. Which thinges prooue diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, not to bee of the eſſence of a Church, as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as can bee wiſhed. Nowe touching reformation of declined Churches, let vs ſee what ſome examples, in that courſe doe afoord vs. When Aſa the firſt renowmed reformer of the declining Churches of Iudea began to ſet in hand ſo glorious an enterpriſe, he that conſidereth the hyſtorie ſhall ſee, that among other things, the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church, lay as a thing caſt downe, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, as appeareth by the reformation thereof, which immediately I ſhall ſpeake of. If then <hi>diſcipline</hi> had bene of the eſſence of the Church, there had not beene at that time, nor in the dayes of Abija his father, anie Church of GOD remayning at Ieruſalem: but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:6732:47"/>
the latter is falſe, and is prooued by the proteſtation of Abija, alittle before he ioyned battell with Ieroboam, and the teſtimony of the ſpirit of God in deliuering that hyſtorie,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 3.4.18.</note> who ſayth. <hi>That the Iſraelites were depreſſed the ſame time, and the children of Iuda ſtrengthened, becauſe they ſtayed vpon the Lorde the God of their fathers.</hi> Therefore the former alſo is falſe, namely that <hi>diſcipline is of the eſſence of a Church.</hi> Alſo if <hi>diſcipline</hi> ſhoulde make it a Church, or bee neceſſarie to the beeing thereof, it appeareth that notwithſtanding all Aſaes reformation, yet, was it as then no Church for the godly to reſorte vnto, ſith the reedification of diſcipline is aſcribed, not to Aſa, but to his ſonne Iehoſaphat,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 19.8.11.</note> after him. Neither may any with probabilitie coniecture, that Aſa ſet vp diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.17.</note> and let it fall againe. For, <hi>to haue an vpright heart all the dayes of his life</hi> (which thing the holie Ghoſt teſtifieth of him) and to ſuffer that which the Lorde had made him ſee to bee woorthie reformation, to goe downe againe, are two thinges contrarie, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee verifyed of one and the ſame ſubiect. But nowe all men that ſauoure the woorde of the Lorde, muſt needes acknowledge, that the Church of Iudea in Aſaes dayes, was a glorious habitation of the Lorde, and the Temple at Ieruſalem, a place then for his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruantes, to doe their ſacrifices and ſeruices vnto him:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.8.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> inſomuch as that <hi>many of the Iſraelites fledde from their owne coastes, to dwell in Iudea, ſeeing thus the Lorde to bee amongeſt them</hi>: So muſt they of like neceſsitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that which therehence firmely is concluded, to witte, <hi>diſcipline</hi> not to bee of the eſſence of a Church. Laſtly, to come to the woorthie Iehoſaphat, who feared no ſlaunderous imputation of arrogancie, or ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie to himſelfe, neither accompted it anye im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment to the dignitie of his father Aſa, though in repayring and beautifying the houſe of GOD, hee ſhoulde exceede him in ſome poyntes: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:6732:47"/>
(I ſay) his courſe of proceeding, if diſcipline were neceſſary to the being of a Church, then all that he did in the beginning of his raigne, was worthy no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 17.5.6.7.8.9.</note> For what good could hee bee ſaid to haue done to the Church, when as all that he had done, could not (by this mans ſaying) gaine it the worthy name of a viſible Church? for as touching the reformation of the diſcipline, it appeareth to haue bene about the latter end of his raigne, after the Lord had by his Prophet,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 19.5.11.</note> rebuked him for yelding wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> aſſiſtance in his enterpriſe. Wherfore, as I hope to heare of no man ſo impudent as to ſay, that the Church of <hi>Iudea</hi> was then no apparant Church of God (I meane in his time before the reuiuing of the diſcipline) ſo am I ſure, that none but ſuch as are growne to that impudency, will hereafter affirme <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> to be of the eſſence of a Church.

Men of meane vnderſtanding knowe, that there are propper accidents to thinges which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated from them, and yet are not of their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. For example, heate cannot bee ſeparated from the fire, nor mouing from the ſunne, yet are neither of thoſe properties any part of their eſſence, nor doeth hee that ſaith, heate is not of the eſſence of fire, nor motion of the eſſence of the ſunne, deny therefore the fire to be hote, or the ſunne to haue his motion. And concerning theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in queſtion, touching which <hi>Browne</hi> ſo arrogantly challengeth M.C. to anſwere whether <hi>they be of the eſſence of the Church</hi>: I would the reader ſhould aſke of him,<note place="margin">

I feare not (vnleſſe you take him in ſome deſperate fit) hee will anſwere, no. Why then, if a thing may truely be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from the eſſence, and neuertheleſſe neceſſarily admitted in the Subiect, howe followeth it, that they that deny the kingly power or authoritie of <hi>Christ,</hi> to bee of the eſſence of a Church, doe there-fore make or feyne a Church that is without it. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voyded, let vs nowe trye, whether <hi>Chriſts power authoritie and office of gouerning,</hi> bee of the very eſſence of a Church, as hee woulde haue it.</p>

Meane time, <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20.21</note> faith is as the engrafting of the braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches into the ſtock, whereby they are vpholden, whileſt that by the ſappe and ſpirit of life proceeding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, they be growne and eſtabliſhed. And as the braunch to be ingrafted, needeth thoſe his enwrappings and bindings, to ſupport and defend it againſt ſundrie inconueniences, till it be able to be without them, and afterward they are of no vſe vnto it: ſo doth faith ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and deſend the tender conſcience, againſt all the ſtormes of temptations, till there be that perfect growth in Chriſt, that is vtterly freed from them, at which time, in like ſort, faith doth ceaſe. But heere withall, thys faith muſt be vnderſtood to admit a twofold conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: the one in reſpect of Gods, the other in reſpect of mans beholding and iudging thereof.

               <p>Yet for to ſtop importunate mouthes whatſoeuer, and to make cleere to the world the confutation of <hi>Brownes</hi> falſe concluſion heere in hand, it is requiſite, that after the large labour of others, I alſo point at ſome profes for this purpoſe, ſhewing that viſible Churches, in as much as they ſtand in the accompt of viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,<note place="margin">Viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are vnited vnto Chriſt by faith only.</note> are vnited vnto Chriſt by faith only.

a reaſonable ſoule) although it be but potentially, and not in acte or outward geſture. If they be not elect, and ſo haue not the annoynting of the ſpirit, nor therefore any faith in the ſight of God, yet receiue they ſo much from the faith of their parents, as to be by it accepted of the viſible Church for a holie ſeede, and partakers of the promiſes, becauſe they, iudging but as men, haue no cauſe at all to doubt thereof.</p>
               <p>This man vrgeth out of <hi>Habacuck,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Habac.</hi> 2.</note> that <hi>The iuſt ſhall liue by his owne faith,</hi> but there was no cauſe: for it is not ſayd, that infants ſhall be ſaued, or liue in the ſight of God by their parents faith, but onely, that by it, they are of men to be reputed within the couenant, and of the viſible Church. Yet he ſtandeth to it, that <hi>Not by the faith of the parents, but by the promiſe made to the righteous and their ſeede, the children are reckoned in the Church.</hi> O trifeler: how are the parents within couenant, and partakers of the promiſes, but by faith? And how doo the promiſed bleſsings deſcend vnto the children, but in regard that their parents beleeued? Wherefore, this foundation will ſtand vnmoued againſt all Papiſts and Apoſtates, that particular viſible Churches are vnited vnto their head Chriſt by faith, and by faith do they ſtand. And certainely it is ſtrange, how this ſhould be doubted of by any that eſteeme themſelues iuſtified by faith, ſith one member hath not a ſeuerall lawe of life by it ſelfe: but looke by what lawe and tenure one by himſelfe enioyeth the ſtate of being in Chriſt, by the ſame alſo doth another, and conſequently many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen till you haue reckoned the whole number of the Church militant.</p>
               <p>Now for the kingly authoritie and gouernement of Chriſt, ſith no corner of the world, no not the vttermoſt borders of his enemies are without it: how can his Church (whereof himſelfe is the head) be imagined to be without it?

from hys rule and gouernment, that therefore hys rule, authoritie, or gouernment, ſhould be of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence thereof.

Agayne, if it followe, that where Chriſtes gouernment and authoritie is not made thus eſſentiall, there it may be concluded, Chriſt is not made eſſentiall: it followeth equally on the contrarie, that where hys authoritye is ſo made eſſentiall, there he is graunted to be eſſentiall alſo: and then ſeeing <hi>Browne</hi> will haue it to be of the eſſence of the aſſemblyes where it is admitted, he moſt vnwarely maketh Chriſt of the eſſence of Popiſh and Heatheniſh companyes, as I ſayd before: for as much as they are all vnder hys kingly authoritye and gouernment: and as well ſitteth he to direct the courſe of hys enemies in all poynts of theyr rage and malice to theyr owne deſtruction, as hys elect in the waye of righteouſneſſe to theyr ſaluation: euen ſo the Scriptures in all places, and namely, the laſt quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, do apparantly teſtifye.</p>
               <p>By thys that is ſayd, I hope, it is cleerely proued, that Ma.

               <p>Alſo, hauing found the eſſence of a Church, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that all thyngs elſe attributed therevnto (and namely Chriſtes gouernment as occupyed in that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect) are referred by the learned to the place of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and ſo was it well ynough gathered by <hi>Browne</hi>

him ſelfe, ſaue that where he interpreteth the word ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, by the word <hi>hang by,</hi> he rather poynteth at the deſert of an Heretick, then noteth out the nature of ſuch an accident. Thus much to hys propoſition.</p>

His reaſon is ſophiſtical, in that he maketh it leſſe probable for a church to faile in matters of diſcipline, than for a chriſtian, in his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of moniſhing his brother: when as contrariwiſe it is more probable, becauſe to the <hi>diſcipline of a Church</hi> is required a conſent: and conſent is neuer free from the clogges &amp; croſsings of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictorie iudgements, which a particular Chriſtian being leſſe ſubiect vnto, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leſſe likelie, equall or probable, that hee ſhould faile. And for more proofe, experience teacheth this euerie where. For in Churches where the diſcipline of Chriſt is either not wholy, or not ſoundly eſtabliſhed, you ſhal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes find ſome particular members diligent and ſound in their duties this way. And I referre to the reader the conſideration of many particular members of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh aſſemblies in this behalfe. I ſaid there was popiſh he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie in the conſequence, and the reader ſhall teſtifie no leſſe, when he conſidereth, that if the reproouing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding brethren bee of the eſſence of a Chriſtian, and no man can denie the doing thereof to be a worke, it folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that works are of the eſſence of a Chriſtian, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of a church, as I haue iuſtly charged him other where. Behold ſtil, whitherto his inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderate courſe doth carie him?

It is true, that ſuch a chriſtian, is a weake chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according to the proportion of his wants and errours, and ſuch a Church is a diſeaſed Church, and that according to the meaſure of her imperfections, but yet ſtill a Chriſtian, and yet ſtill a Church, for the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall cauſes aforeſaid.<note place="margin">

Thirdly, if they had cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſed their children as they ought, at 8. daies old, &amp; not deferred it vntil they were of age, al men may know, that the children caried of their mothers, could not haue bene hurt by their mothers trauaile with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

In this respect alſo, certaine aſſemblies of our profeſſion, which hauing the vſe of the diſcipline permitted vnto them, and not ſuffered to haue the vſe of the Sacrament of the Lordes ſupper, are not therefore when the Lordes Churches are muſtered, and their names written and enrouled vp, caſt out as vnfit to be in any account of the Lordes hoste.

To ſay therefore it is none of the Church of God, becauſe it hath not receiued this diſcipline, me thinkes it is all one with this, as if a man woulde ſay, It is no Citie, becauſe it hath no wall: or, that it is no vineyarde, becauſe it hath neither hedge nor ditch. It is not, I graunt, ſo ſightly a Citie or vineyarde, nor yet ſo ſafe against the inuaſion of their ſeuerall enemies, which lye in wayte for them: but yet are they truely both Cities and vineyardes.</hi> Agaynſt this, <hi>Browne</hi> trifleth beyonde all meaſure. And firſt, as if M. C. had ſayde,<note place="margin">Pag. 43.44.45.</note> that the walles of Hieruſalem, by preciſe teſtimonie out of the Scripture, ſignified <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> whereas hee draweth the ſimilitude but indifferentlye as from anye Citye, though Hieruſalem bee named as a famous inſtance, in ſteade of all others in lyke caſe: and that hee doeth touching the vſe of a wall, which is moſt apt to ſet foorth the effecte and fruite of the <hi>Diſcipline</hi>: becauſe, as the one is the defence of a citie whereby it is continued, ſo the other preſerueth a Church in health and ſtable ſtanding. And it is moſt ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh that vpon ſome places of Scripture (and the chiefe of them touching onely the Catholique Church, and ſo
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:6732:63"/>
quite from the queſtion of a particular) by which the Church may be ſaid to be builded in the walles of a city, to reaſon as though it may not therefore in any wiſe be compared alſo with the Citizens &amp; Burgeſſes of a Citie, which are compaſſed with diſcipline, as with walles: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Saint Paul</hi> doeth tearme them citizens of the Saintes.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.19.</note> So is it more then childiſh, that he citeth the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> for the praiſing of the citie by the walles and gates thereof, ſith euery Grammar boy coulde haue tolde him it to be a trope of <hi>Synecdoche</hi>: a part for the whole.

The praiſes of Ieruſalem therefore taken from the walles and gates thereof, is (as I haue ſaid) a ſpeach, wherein the leſſe is taken to note the greater, &amp; is more effectuall then if he named the whole, or the greater parts thereof. For ſeeing the Lord loueth the wal ſo much, or the gates more then other cities, how much more the whole citie? and although he thinke it is no Church til the walles be builded, yet the reader ſhal obſerue, that the people of God ſacrificed, as in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (which was the place only appointed for the ſacrifice) when only the foundation of the temple was laide,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezra.</hi> 3.</note> and found therein that mercie &amp; comfort from the Lord, for the which they ſolemnly praiſed his holy Name. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly is it meet for Chriſtians in a careful endeuour of further building, to be thankful euen for the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: though <hi>Browne</hi> can find no matter of thanks vnleſſe we had all. whereas if he ſtil withdraw, til he find ſuch a church, yea as that hath the walles of diſcipline made vp in all the parts that he reſpecteth, &amp; as his beſt writings intend, he ſhall neuer ioyne with any Church, if he could liue whileſt the world endureth. But to proceede to the reſt of his cauils, there needeth no great remembrance to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:6732:63"/>
bring forth what a citie may be without a wall, and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard without a hedge.<note place="margin">Pol. Ariſt. lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> And if he had conceiued of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; definition of a city, any whit more ſcholerlike than a waterbearer, he would with the learned, &amp; all that be ſkilful in the ſtate of things, haue defined it, by the lawes and policie, and not by the walles thereof. For if it ſhould happen to be diſmantilled, it ceaſeth not therefore to be a citie. When as therefore a number of men may meete together to aſſociate themſelues by certaine lawes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements amongſt themſelues, without hauing a wall, it is euident that a citie may bee without a wall. Likewiſe let al indifferent men iudge, whether a ſpace of ground ſet and furniſhed with plants, or hearbs, hath the ſubſtance of a garden, orchard, or vineyard, and is rightly to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo. I ſpeake not of what courſe we take, in making or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards or vineyards, but of what courſe may be taken in this buſines, in regard of the ſubſtance of the things. And ſo, if a man not fearing, or not foreſeeing ſuch outwarde violences, as a fence might keepe out, doe repleniſh, as is aforeſaide, his ground adioining to his houſe or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, for the vſes of orchard, garden or vineyarde, ſhall they not in deed be ſuch things, and ſo truely called of him? And if afterward, finding or conceiuing a diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the want, wil he not ſay, I muſt ſenſe in my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard-garden or vineyard? If Browne ſcorne to be taught theſe things of the learned, or of common ſenſe, yet (at leaſt) let him lay his hand on his mouth, and hearken to the prophet, by whom the Lord ſaid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zecha.</hi> 2.4<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

Now to become of a citie no citie, is no mending but declining caſe, but the Lord ſpeaketh thereby, of their bettering and happier ſtate: and therefore the want of a wall taketh not away the being of a citie. And I pray you, in a citie beſieged, the walles in many breeches, through the batterie, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, tell me what it is, that the ſouldiors afterwards are

                     <hi>Eſay.</hi> 5.</note> muſt you not ſay, they ſacke the citie? Alſo Eſay doth manifeſtly declare, that the Lord planted his vineyard, yer euer he hedged it, or did other coſt vnto it. And when he magnifieth his mercy thus towardes his church, in ſaying that by this means, he had left nothing vndone which he could do to his vineyard, he therby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that he had done more to it, than many that haue vineyards vſe to do. And therfore more than was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the very being of it. Again, by the ſame reaſon that they denie it to be a vineyard, becauſe it hath no hedge, they might denie it to bee a vineyarde becauſe it hath no watchtower, winepreſſe, and ſuch other. Moreouer when the Lord tooke away the hedge, as there he threatneth he would, I would knowe, what the enemies of the Church did tread vnderneath their feete, did they not treade the the Lords vineyard? But it may bee thought a ſhame to ſtand ſo long in the proofe of this which <hi>Browne</hi> is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed with tedious ſtrife of words to denie.</p>
               <p>When as theſe things, by the grace of God, are thus eſtabliſhed, the contrarie miſtes diſpelled, which the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie had caſt in, to darken the trueth, and diſcipline founde, not to be of the eſſence of a Church, which is the verie knife, whereby al the ſinewes of the Browniſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious arme againſt the Church of Englande (from which they draw their diſciples,) are cut aſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der: yet in the knitting vp of this point, there be two things, which in as fewe wordes as I can, I woulde admoniſh the reader of.

The Iewes ſo pleaded the prerogatiue of the Temple, to confute the Prophetes threatning of iudgements, for their ſinnes and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: as though it could not be true, that by any means God ſhould forſake them, to whom hee had made ſuch plenteous promiſes, &amp; that ſo long as they kept the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal worſhip which God had appointed, they thought themſelues not ſo far chargeable with their wicked ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Directly contrary both in iudgement and affection, are wee vnto them (by the grace of God) in all this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. We eſteeme the ſtate of our Church in ſome reſpects grieuous and lamentable ynough, full of prouocations of the heauie diſpleaſure and indignation of the Lorde, which as wee acknowledge to bee moſt iuſt, if they had bene powred downe vpon vs now long ago: ſo wee are out of doubt they wil come, if we find not grace to turn and ſeeke the Lorde more dutifully, while the day of his long ſuffering yet endureth. And for this cauſe we ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſeech thoſe rhat are the Lordes remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, not to keepe ſilence, neither to giue him reſt,<note place="margin">

If we will knowe what he meaneth by <hi>the bondage of the Church,</hi> let other places of his giue the interpretation.

In the 15.

where they dwell. Neither doe I by that word <hi>onely</hi> adde any thing that is not his.

ſorts of corruptions, the firſt, of ſpeculations, the ſecond, of he himſelfe cannot tell what, ſaue that he ſayth, it ſtandeth vpon custome and fayned inſpirations: the third was of ioyning the Lawe worſhip with the Goſpell. Thus he would poynt at Paules meaning, and doth driue another way. For Paule nameth the vanitie and deceiptfulnes of Philoſophie, and ſheweth, that that is after mans traditions, or the rules and principles of this world, and not after Chriſt: and ſo he doth ſtrike at that ſtrong tree of vanitie, which is Philoſophie, and the roote thereof, which is mans traditions, or the rules and principles of their worldly artes. But Beza for one tree, hath got himſelfe three, namely, ſpeculations, customes, and inspirations, and the ceremoniall worſhip. In ſtead of philoſophy, which Paule calleth vayne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, he nameth curious ſpeculations; as if one ſhould aske a Hatchet, and he ſhould giue him the helue. Paule would roote out all their philoſophie; and Beza but ſome part, &amp;c.</hi> A man would thinke there needeth no great labour to prooue out of theſe words, that <hi>Browne</hi> holdeth both lodgick and all philoſophy to be forbidden in the Scriptures: but heare him further, for ſoone after, he taketh vpon him, out of Timothy and Iob, to reiect euery part of lodgick by name, and therevpon follow theſe words: <hi>But what, ſay they, is there no vſe of lodgick? what ſay you then to a thing and the cauſe thereof? for the effect is knowne by the cauſe, and the cauſe by the effect: ſo they giue vs four ſorts of cauſes, but we returne them vpon them as the ſpillings of their drunkennes.</hi> Againe, <hi>They demaund heere, whether definitions be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, we anſwere, that to name the kinds and ſorts of things, and to name their natures, is not vnlawfull, but their idle arte of defining is vnlawfull: and to thruſt their definitions as miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into our boſomes, or to tearme the naming of things, or their natures whereby they are called, by the words of their vaine arte is wholly vnlawfull.</hi> It is manifeſt that when he wrote theſe things, he diſſembled not (as now he doth) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the condemning of lodgick: elſe let euen his next words following the laſt rehearſed (wherein he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to anſwere an obiection againſt him) be called to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:6732:70"/>
witneſſe. <hi>If they aske</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>why me then vſe the names, and haue laboured alſo ſo much in defining, we tell them, that we returne their owne weapons vpon them, not that we care for ſuch weapons, but becauſe they feare them ſo much, we haue tryed if they may diſmay them in their folly, and turne them to the truth.</hi> Heere by the manner of his anſwere, (you ſee) is nothing leſſe, then a denyall of condemning the arte, which is now all the refuge the ſnared Foxe can finde. If he could haue enioyed his ſuppoſed reſt, within the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of that anſwere, there ſhould his Ship haue remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtill, but when he perceiued by the admonition, that there was a rocke for his eſtimation to periſh vpon (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this cannot be denyed, that whatſoeuer things are vnlawfull, Chriſtians ought not vſe) he rather choſe this ſhameleſſe denying of that which cannot be denied, then that he would giue glory vnto God, in acknowledging his fault, and forſaking his errour: wherein let all true Iſraelites iudge, whether it appeare, that the loue of himſelfe and prayſe of men, be more pretious in his eyes, then the loue of God, and prayſe of his glorious name.</p>

Yet leaſt his dealing in this manner ſhould encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage others to deale in worſe manner, he openly preached againſt the calling and authorizing of preachers by Biſhops, and ſpake it often alſo openly in Cambridge, that he taught among them, not as caring for, or leaning vpon the Bi. authority, but only to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his duty and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience.</hi> Alſo in the ſame diſcourſe he hath theſe words, <hi>This he</hi> (that is himſelf) <hi>iudged not only to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wickednes of the Bi. but alſo againſt their whole power and authority: for if the authority of the Church, and of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt brethren or elders therein, be aboue the Bi. how ſhould it not follow, but that the Bi. may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, accuſed &amp; char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Church, yea alſo diſcharged and ſeparated as is their deſert? but now becauſe of their popiſh power and canon lawes, they haue lift vp their authority more high, then the Church ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take accompts of them: and not only by force do thruſt out and trouble whom they liſt, but alſo raigne as Lords &amp; Dukes in their dioces, their authority muſt needes be vſurped.</hi> And a little ſpace after he ſaith thus of them, that <hi>They rule by three ſorts of lawes, as by the ciuill, the canon, the common lawe, which

This I ſo lay downe, that the ſlipperie ſhifter ſhould not thinke to eſcape me, by drawing an interpretation from theſe wordes, to his conuenticles at his pleaſure. There be 3. notes of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that will not ſuffer theſe wordes, <hi>this church,</hi> to be vnderſtoode of his conuenticles. 1. That the title of <hi>the Church of Englande,</hi> can not without great inſolencie, be attributed to any other, then that which is eſtabliſhed by the law of the land: and that, he ſheweth him ſelfe to ſee well ynough in his 62. ſection of his Anſwere to my Admon. where, for the ſame reaſon (though it helped his cauſe neuer a whit) he quarelleth with me, for calling the church at Corinth, <hi>The church of Corinth.</hi> 2. Their conuenticles can not be ſaid to be <hi>frequented according to the lawe,</hi> without the like inſolencie of ſpeach, as in the former note. For by this forme of wordes, is alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>the lawe of the land</hi>: &amp; whenſoeuer the law of God is ſpoken of, it is euer ſet downe with thoſe or the like plaine wordes of difference? els let them ſhewe one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the contrary. But the third difference is moſt cleare: for hauing bound him ſelfe to frequent and hold the peace of <hi>our Churches,</hi> he is taken faſter, then that any ſtruggling can giue him hope of eſcape. Thus hauing voyded the doubtfulnes of his ſubſcription, let vs nowe come and try, how well his heart &amp; his hande haue gone together, &amp; that I may rake no further in his filthie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, (whereof I ſuppoſe the reader would be as wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as my ſelfe) let the former cited places of his writings, be here likewiſe called to witneſſe, what a friende he is to the church of England, and what peace he entertaineth with our aſſemblies. As for his practiſe euen ſince his ſubſcription (omitting all that was before, and namely
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:6732:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his runnning ouer the ſea, and carying many with him) the pariſh where he dwelt of late, doeth teſtifie, as is ſaide before, that it is farre from a peaceable and quiet beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour towardes the Church: but much more the pariſh of <hi>Olaues in Siluerſtreete,</hi> a poore woman in the which, he hath ſo ſtrongly ſeduced, that whereas my ſelfe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had hope, by ſatiſfying her propounded doubts in writing, to haue wonne her into our aſſemblies, &amp; church exerciſes, which of many in that pariſh was greatly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he hath againe, by ſo large a writing and heape of wordes, ouerwhelmed the ſeelie woman (who belike thinketh v. or vi. ſheetes of paper muſt needes confute one) and confirmed her in her ſottiſh ſeparation, ſo as at this day in reſpect of inferiour meanes, we ſee vtterly no hope of her recouerie. As for excommunication gone out againſt her, ſhe altogether contemned it, before halfe a ſcore of the pariſh: and boaſted of <hi>Bro.</hi> ſpreading of his writings againſt me, to a hundreth miles diſtance from <hi>London.</hi> Beſides this, &amp; ſomewhat later, he hath diſturbed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at <hi>Dertford,</hi> drawn away ſome, railed ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; diſperſed writings, as of chalenge againſt the lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer there,<note place="margin">M. Edmondes.</note> for diſcouering vnto his auditorie the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of that ſchiſme. Beholde, is not this quiet behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and tending to the peace of <hi>this Church</hi>? the latter part of his laſt interrogatorie, being this, <hi>that he ſhoulde not preach, nor exerciſe the ministerie, vnleſſe he be lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereunto,</hi> is aſwell obſerued and kept by him, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you. I thinke hee dares not (for the euidence of proofe that he knoweth to be againſt him) deny, that he hath ſince his ſubſcribing, preached in priuate houſes: &amp; namely amongſt the reſt, one <hi>Lordes day,</hi> &amp; not farre from <hi>Ludgate</hi>: hauing a litle before in the ſame houſe earneſtly conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded againſt, in reaſoning, &amp; diſſwaded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> publique hearing. He was at the ſame time by one M. W. ſoundly reſiſted in the ſame his ſchiſmatical dealing: who rightly iudged it not meete, in a time of the great aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies of the church, to the publike exerciſes of the worde and prayer,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6732:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to make priuate meetings for the ſame at our pleaſure. And M. W. after he had ſpoken in this matter, what the Lord then gaue him, departed with ſome others that went with him to the next ſermon, and left <hi>Browne</hi> with the reſt that liked better to tarrie, to their curſed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Wherin <hi>Bro.</hi> tooke vpon him to exerciſe the miniſterie of preaching: howbeit (he ſaith) he was earneſtly reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted vnto it by thoſe that were preſent. Now that poynt therfore wil I leaue to the lerned to decide: namely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this was a lawful calling to that miniſtrie, yea or no.</p>
               <p>Beſides the ſubſcribing to theſe interrogatories, hee furthermore wrote his ſubmiſſion: a point or 2. whereof I will likewiſe ſet in the vewe of the Reader. <hi>Fiftly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I refuſe not to communicate in the Sacraments. For I haue one childe that is alreadie baptized, according to the order and lawe, and by this time in mine abſence, if God haue giuen my wife a ſafe deliuerance, and the childe doe liue, I ſuppoſe it is alſo bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in like maner. Further, my ſeruants being three, doe order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to their owne Pariſh Church, according to the lawe, and communicate alſo according to the Lawe.</hi> Hereupon hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>To all theſe poyntes that they are true, I do ſubſcribe with mine hande and name, this</hi> 7. <hi>of October, Anno Dom.</hi> 1585. Here I obſerue, that he teſtifieth it to be orderly done, to come to our owne pariſh Churches: which is more then his writings can well beare, howſoeuer he thinke to ſhift it. Alſo in that he ſayth, he <hi>refuſeth not to communicate in the Sacraments</hi>: perhaps he ſtoppeth the crye of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, (which telleth him, he communicateth not in the Sacraments with our congregation) by this fooliſh and deceitfull perſwaſion: namely, that he ſatisfieth his promiſe by communicating in the Sacraments, though but in his owne conuenticles. But his argument of fact, that he giueth to bring credite withall vnto the ſame aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, as in theſe wordes: <hi>For I haue one childe thas is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready baptized according to order and Lawe, &amp;c.</hi> this (I ſay) ſtoppeth vp that ſtarting hole againſt him. And then it woulde bee ſhewed in what congregation of ours,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:6732:79"/>
hee hath communicated in the Sacraments, ſince the day of his running ouer ſea. Nay if his behauiour bee truely obſerued, when hee commeth into our congregations, I doe not thinke, it can bee proued, that hee hath ſince that day, ſo much as ioyned with them in their prayers.<note place="margin">Brown the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> To this laſt place of the matter of <hi>Brownes</hi> ſubſcription, I haue reſerued one thing, which is good for al to know, and ſome to prouide for, and that is this. Anſwering to my Admonition for that point of his ſubſcription, which I had obiected againſt him, as a proofe of a vile conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he graunteth that he had ſubſcribed, but he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he had ſo ſubſcribed, as that he ſhould be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againſt himſelfe thereby, in anie thing. Thereupon he ſetteth me downe (though vntruly as you haue heard) certaine fourmes of the pointes whereunto hee did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, and there withall telleth mee, what handſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of his owne wordes he can make: whereby giuing one hand, to the ſatisfying of the authoritie, that then dealt with him, with the other hee ſtroketh the eyes of his fooliſh followers, that they might ſleepe ſtill in the opinion of his good meaning. As though the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of <hi>Rob. Browne,</hi> had not otherwiſe bene vile ynough, except he had by this means ſhewed, that he hath not one haire of an honeſt man about him. Read (beloued) and then teſtifie. The firſt article of his ſubſcription he repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thus. <hi>The biſhops ciuill authoritie Browne did acknowledge lawfull in his ſubſcription, and their magiſtracie to bee obeyed.</hi> Well, how doe you thinke he maketh this agree with his bookes? euen thus hee telles you, that <hi>hee doeth by thoſe wordes, neither iuſtifie thoſe for brethren which doe perſecute, nor allow an idle and Lordly miniſterie in the Church as a part of the brotherhoode.</hi> How the reader can conceyue this, that he denieth vpon his ſubſcription, I knowe not: but thus much I am ſure, this his explication certifieth, that the BB. being by the Queene and her lawes, allowed the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of <hi>Lordes,</hi> are accounted of Browne not to bee mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church. And by this anſwere it appeareth, he
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:6732:80"/>
coggeth this imagination into his diſciples, that hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the BB. ciuill authoritie, but therewithall denied them their eccleſiaſticall miniſterie. Howbeit, in plaine wordes he ſubſcribed to their authoritie. To couer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the 2. article, hee is faine to hide the trueth, as I haue before diſcouered. For the third, though he vſe the ſame craft, yet in that hee cannot but confeſſe that hee ſubſcribed, <hi>that his childe was baptized according to order of lawe,</hi> to ſalue his credite with his companions in this, hee ſaith, <hi>But yet it was done without his conſent, and contrary to an order he had taken and appointed: for it was baptiſed in England he being beyonde the ſea.</hi> If it were contrarie to his purpoſe, howe coulde it argue his not refuſing to communicate in the Sacrament? On the other ſide, if hee tell his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples true of his meaning herein, that hee had taken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order for his childs baptizing, but that his being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſea, croſſed his purpoſe: how agreeth that with his neglecting of the ſame order taking, for his later childes baptizing, which euen at the time of his ſubſcription, he alledged (by way of coniecture, as <hi>if God had giuen his wife ſafe deliuerance) to be baptized alſo according to lawe.</hi> He was nowe in Englande when hee might haue taken bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter order, if the firſt were ſuch an errour. But becauſe he had no ſuch colourable excuſe for this, he tooke a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way, though no leſſe ſhamefull, in ſtepping ouer that part of the article, as though there had beene no ſuch thing. Alſo for his alleaging his <hi>ſeruants comming to Church according to lawe,</hi> whereby he perſwaded vnto the BB. his owne conformitie that way, he excuſeth this to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to be, <hi>for that he was not to force his ſeruants agaynſt their conſcience and custome, being newly come to him.</hi> Adding this beſide, that he <hi>neuer came to the ſame Church with them, the parſon beeing a common drunkard, and infamous by ſundrie faults.</hi> Againe, confeſsing he promiſed the BB. on the one ſide, that <hi>he would come to Church according to order of lawe,</hi> On the other ſide, hee perſwadeth his diſciples, that hee might well ynough doe ſo, <hi>for that there was no lawe to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:6732:80"/>
force him to take ſuch a parſon for his lawfull miniſter, neither to ioyne with him in the prayers and Sacraments.</hi> Thus hath hee firſt manifeſtly mocked authoritie,<note place="margin">Iude verſ. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> ſo as that place of Iude which hee had wrongfully writhen towardes mee, returneth nowe againe with full force vppon his owne heade. And ſecondly, hee apparantly ſheweth that hee continueth his olde courſe of ſeducing the ſeelie ſheepe, euen as heretofore. In ſumme, if all that is here ſayde, touching his ſubſcription, bee melted together as in one lumpe, where ſhall wee find a more perfect image of a peſtilent ſchiſmaticke, and one more voide of all conſcience, than is this Browne, though Rome it ſelfe be raked through to find him? Howe well doe theſe notes (which were long agoe obſerued to be the verie proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all heretikes) agree with this mans maners:<note place="margin">Clemens Stro. lib. <hi>7.</hi>

Theſe are they that come in ſheepes clothing. Sheepe they are in ſhew, foxes for craft, but wolues in act and crueltie.

I knowe the office and the officer is not all one: but where the officer wanteth, there the office alſo wanteth, as touching the execution thereof.

                     <hi>Def.</hi> 51.53.</note> is wanting. For whie elſe doth he ſay, the Church of England is without this diſcipline, if the ſame may bee graunted to be, where the Elderſhippe is not? Nowe his anſwere explicating his ſeconde enunciation, which I vrge agaynſt the firſt, ſayeth, <hi>His meaning was, that a Church remayneth ſtill, though all the officers of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline should die at once, becauſe</hi> (forſooth) <hi>yet ſtill the office and right of gouernement ſhoulde remaine.</hi> I replie: that the gouernement which hee ſpeaketh of, in this caſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſayde to bee actually, but potentially. And if he holde it ſufficient, to auouche the apparancie of a Churche (whereof is and was the queſtion in the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence alleaged) by a potentiall hauing of diſcipline, wee ſhall ſoone ende the controuerſie for the aſſemblies of Englande. But I may not heere omitte to note the dealing of this double faced <hi>Ianus.</hi> In the conference which the Admonition citeth againſt him: through the occaſion of his writings agaynſt the Church of England, it was obiected to him, that it ſeemed hee had condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our Churches, in that they were not guided by <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteries.</hi> Hee denied his writings to import any ſuch thing. Hereupon they demaunde, whether (then) hee woulde graunt that there may be a true Church of God without the <hi>Presbiterie.</hi> He anſwered, yea. Nowe in his writing agaynſt mee, hee denieth not that hee anſwered ſo, but declareth his meaning to bee otherwiſe than they tooke it. So that if they had further vrged his writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt his anſwere, it nowe appeareth, that he could cunningly haue turned the table vpſide downe, as the painter did: who beeing hired to paint a tumbling horſe, made him running: which when hee that ſet him a woorke found fault withall, the painter turned the table
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:6732:81"/>
vpſide downe: and then the horſe which before appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red running, ſeemed plainely to lie tumbling. But what dealing was this for a diuine, to a queſtion propounded, of the conſtitution of a church, neceſſarie to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of it, (as appeareth by this occaſion of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion before rehearſed) to make anſwere concerning an accidentall caſe of a conſtituted Church? And this anſwere beeing but as the lining of his wordes, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſeeming altogether correſpondent to their purpoſe. So dealeth hee generally in all his writings and actions for this his ſchiſmaticall courſe: and namely in moſt of the points of his ſubſcription: as that no childe can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repreſent the viſage of his father that begot him, than this man doeth the ſpirit of him that gaue thoſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full anſweres at <hi>Delphos,</hi>
