            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER FROM A Gentleman in <hi>London</hi> to his Friend in the Countrey, on the Occaſion of the late <hi>Tryal</hi> of STEPHEN COLLEDGE</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen I had the Happineſs to ſee you laſt, I remember (upon our Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing concerning the <hi>Popiſh Plot)</hi> you ſeem'd to have a more Charitable Opinion of the <hi>Phanatical Party</hi> than ordinary; for that they appear'd ſo mighty ſolicitous for the Security of His <hi>Majeſties Perſon,</hi> and of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> by Clamouring for a Strict Proſecution of that <hi>Damnable Conſpiracy:</hi> But by this time, and upon this new Face of Affairs, you are Convinc'd, (no doubt,) that they deſerv'd not your good Thoughts, and hold their Deviliſh Practices in juſt deteſtation; for <hi>Colledg</hi>'s <hi>Tryal</hi> is a Clear Proof, (I wiſh it were the onely one they had afforded us) that when they pretend the greateſt Loyalty to their <hi>Prince,</hi> 'tis only for a Cloak to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome <hi>Exeorable Deſign</hi> they have in hand. They are moſt certainly, <hi>(Sir,) Wolves</hi> in <hi>Sheeps Cloathing,</hi> Men that will <hi>Judas-</hi>like betray with a <hi>Kiſs.</hi> But if it happens that their <hi>Perfidious Practices</hi> come once to be detected, and any One <hi>Criminal</hi> brought to the <hi>Bar of Juſtice;</hi> with what Zeal does the whole Faction appear in His Defence? They Impeach the <hi>Credit</hi> of the <hi>Kings Evidence;</hi> Expoſing them by the Names of <hi>Papiſts, Iriſh Tories,</hi> &amp;c. and Exert their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt all that dare believe what is <hi>Atteſted;</hi> or that Pretend to Maintain the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Authority</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> againſt the <hi>Deſigning Contrivances</hi> of theſe <hi>Indefatigable Workers of Iniquity.</hi> They will at any rate procure Perſons to <hi>Oppoſe</hi> and <hi>Confront</hi> the <hi>Kinks Evidence,</hi> by poſitively aſſerting any thing that may tend to invalidate their <hi>Teſtimonies.</hi> and rather than appear deficient, will produce Witneſſes, only to make a <hi>noiſe</hi> in the World, or thereby to inſinuate into the Minds of the <hi>too-Credulous Vulgar</hi> a belief of their <hi>Innocence.</hi> And theſe forſooth muſt all be heard, though perhaps they ſpeak ſcarce One word to the purpoſe. This is wonderfully apparent in <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi>'s <hi>Tryal,</hi> in which, beſides the many Remote Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances multiplied by <hi>Colledg</hi>'s <hi>Witneſses,</hi> a Plain and Groſs Falſhood appears by Comparing the <hi>53th. 54th</hi> and <hi>55th.</hi> Pages with the <hi>56th.</hi> Page 53. Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> affirms that the whole time of Alderman <hi>Wilcox</hi>'s <hi>Treate</hi> at the <hi>Crown-Tavern</hi> without <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> was ſpent in a <hi>Philoſophical Diſcourſe</hi> betwixt <hi>himſelf</hi> and Mr. <hi>Savage,</hi> and for the Truth of it Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of Mr. <hi>Thomas S.</hi> and his <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> The former, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> Concurrs with the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and ſays P. 54. that all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was about ſome Points in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> concerning the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> of the <hi>Soul;</hi> and was confident that nothing of <hi>Treaſon</hi> could come from <hi>Colledg,</hi> for that he fell aſleep. All which, and much more was oppoſed to Mr. <hi>John Smith</hi>'s Teſtimony; and from thence <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> inferrs <hi>[Thus you ſee, My Lord,</hi> Smith's <hi>Teſtimony is falſe.]</hi> And that he might make the thing more Conſpicuous, he calls in Mr. <hi>Samuel Oates,</hi> who <hi>P.</hi> 56. out of his Extraordinary Zeal to the Cauſe peremptorily undertakes to illuſtrate the Point, and gives a Relation of all the Diſcourſe above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which he ſays (and is very confident in it) was about. Matters of <hi>Common Diſcourſe,</hi> Matters of <hi>Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Drinking,</hi> &amp;c. and that there was not a word mention'd of the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Immortality of the Soul:</hi> which plainly Contradicts, and gives the lye to both Dr. <hi>O.</hi> and the ſaid <hi>S.</hi> From whence it is Evident, how much theſe men prefer the Intereſt of their <hi>Party</hi> before <hi>Loyalty, Truth</hi> or <hi>Juſtice.</hi> And yet theſe are the men that Applaud themſelves ſo much upon their <hi>Religion</hi> And to ſet the fairer Gloſs upon their <hi>Pernicious Enterprizes,</hi> they ſhelter their <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Conſpiracies</hi> under the Notion of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> and <hi>True Proteſtantiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It now is, (as it formerly was,) their Work and Endeavour to <hi>Leſsen</hi> the <hi>Kings Authority,</hi> which is the only way to make it <hi>void;</hi> and they Act and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the <hi>Firſt,</hi> out of a Deſign to make it ſubſervient to the <hi>Latter.</hi> It is not Policy (you know) for People to Declare their Deſigns at firſt; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a plauſible pretence for the carrying them on, thereby to Blind the Eyes of the <hi>Adverſe Party,</hi> it's improbable they ſhould prove any otherwiſe than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual. 'Tis a proverbial ſaying <hi>Ingenium vires ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat.</hi> And a War cannot be maintained, if it be not as well upheld by Stratagems as by Force. In our <hi>late Troubles</hi> the pretence was to <hi>Reſcue</hi> the King out of the hands of <hi>Wicked Council.</hi> But having once done that (as they ſuppoſed) they not only afforded him no <hi>better,</hi> but took away his <hi>Authority,</hi> clap't him up in <hi>Priſon,</hi> and there kept him ſecure, till they convey'd him to the <hi>Scaffold.</hi> And which was an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation to their Wickedneſs, they did not do this only to make themſelves <hi>Supreme,</hi> but looking upon themſelves as the <hi>Higheſt Authority,</hi> they
<pb facs="tcp:56404:2"/>
thought they might thereby lawfully do this, and far more; fancying the <hi>King</hi> to be more <hi>ſubject</hi> to their <hi>Wills;</hi> than ever their <hi>Allegiance</hi> bound them to His <hi>Sovereignty.</hi> Nay and to ſo great a height is the <hi>impudence</hi> and <hi>inſolence</hi> of ſome <hi>Hot-Headed Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks</hi> now grown, that they are ſo far from dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and repenting of that <hi>Barbarous Villany,</hi> that they ſtill juſtifie it; impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> Tryal. <hi>pag.</hi> 31.</note> reflecting on that <hi>Sacred Martyr.</hi> And others of them that are more wary, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhift off that <hi>abominable impiety</hi> by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſtrong enough (perhaps) to work upon the <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi> and <hi>credulity</hi> of a fort of <hi>ignorant People;</hi> who yet are not now (ſurely) any longer to be blinded with ſuch <hi>ſpecious pretences,</hi> ſince it does ſo evidently appear that they want not a <hi>Will</hi> to act a ſecond part of that <hi>diſmal Tragedy.</hi> They rail with open mouth againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ('tis true) and with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſhew of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> for the preſervation of His <hi>Majeſties Perſon,</hi> do ſeemingly deteſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr their <hi>depoſing</hi> and <hi>King-killing doctrine;</hi> But then at the ſame time (you ſee) they are ſecretly undermining the <hi>Eſtabliſhed Government,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring and deſigning the <hi>utter extirpation</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> and conſequently the deſtruction of the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family.</hi> They ſtick not to accuſe the <hi>Kings beſt</hi> and moſt <hi>eminent Friends</hi> (nay the King himſelf) of a Deſign to introduce <hi>Popery,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>pags</hi> 29.</note> and <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> And at the ſame time are doing their beſt to diveſt His Majeſty of His <hi>Regal Power</hi> ſo to introduce a <hi>Republick.</hi> Theſe are the men that take ſuch care for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of His <hi>Majeſties Perſon</hi> &amp; the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> againſt the <hi>Deſigns</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> And (truely) they had pitch'd upon a ready way to effect it. For <hi>Firſt</hi> (as has been depoſ'd upon oath) they intended to <hi>ſeize</hi> His <hi>Sacred Perſon:</hi> And <note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 29. 30.</note> And then (if He would not comply with their unjuſt Deſires, (or the <hi>Prieſts</hi> that herd amongſt them did not do this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) to ſerve him as they did His <hi>Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 30.</note> So that tho' His Majeſty had through the <hi>unparalell'd care</hi> of this <hi>Godly Party</hi> eſcap'd the ſnares of <hi>Popery,</hi> yet he had been obnoxious to the ſame <hi>Depoſing</hi> and <hi>King-killing Principles</hi> only in terms convertible from DEPOSING and KIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LING to a BRINGING TO JUSTICE. Neither are the <hi>unreaſonable deſires</hi> of theſe <hi>inſatiable Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants</hi> ever to be ſatisfied, They muſt have the <hi>Duke of</hi> York <hi>totally excluded,</hi> or elſe their <hi>Religion, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Properties, Lives and Fortunes</hi> are <hi>unſafe,</hi> and in danger of being ſacrific'd to the <hi>Popes Supremacy.</hi> So they give out. Whereas it is now clear that they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd to remove that obſtacle, only to the intent that they might be the better able to take a fairer aim at the <hi>Kings own Perſon.</hi> And indeed it is the <hi>Preſent</hi> yoke of <hi>Monarchy</hi> that lyes ſo heavy upon their Backs: not the fear of <hi>Popery to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee <hi>(Sir)</hi> that what His <hi>Majeſty</hi> lately Declar'd touching the <hi>Excluſion</hi> of His <hi>Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was upon great <hi>Foreſight</hi> and <hi>Judgment [We can not</hi> (ſays His Majeſty, Kings Decl. <hi>p.</hi> 7.) <hi>after the ſad experience we have had of the late Civil Wars, that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd our Father of bleſſed memory and ruin'd the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, conſent to a Law that ſhall eſtabliſh another moſt unnatural War, or at leaſt make it neceſsary to maintain a ſtanding Force for the Preſerving the Government and the Peace of the Kingdom. And we have Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that if we could have been brought to give our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a Bill of Excluſion, the intent was not to reſt there, but to paſs further, and to attempt ſome other great and important Changes even in preſent.]</hi> For could ſuch Wretches as theſe have had their wills, they meant not only to <hi>exclude</hi> His R. H. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 30.</note> but to <hi>extirpate</hi> the whole Family of the <hi>Stuarts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies</hi> they ſo much pretend, are firſt created chiefly by the great <hi>Donns</hi> of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and then moſt impiouſly infuſ'd into the minds of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> and <hi>Ignorant,</hi> who believe what the <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> of the <hi>Faction</hi> deliver to them with as ſtedfaſt a faith, as the <hi>Heathens</hi> of old did their <hi>Oracles;</hi> and are as verily perſwaded that their <hi>own Principles</hi> are <hi>Divine,</hi> as are the <hi>Papiſts</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>infallible.</hi> Upon the leaſt Exerciſe of His <hi>Majeſties Prerogative,</hi> there are amongſt them that poſſeſs the People with <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies</hi> of their <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> being invaded, and of the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach'd upon; while their deſign is of a far larger extent; for their <hi>devouring appetites</hi> will never be <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated</hi> till the <hi>Kings Royal Prerogative</hi> ſhall be totally <hi>ſwallowed up</hi> by the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Subject;</hi> and then indeed His <hi>Majeſty</hi> is in a fair way (according to the <hi>Phanatical Loyalty)</hi> of being made a <hi>Glorious Prince</hi> like His <hi>Father.</hi>

            <p>Now let any <hi>ſober, ſerious</hi> and <hi>unbiaſsed man</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether theſe are <hi>ſuitable Returns</hi> to ſo <hi>merciful</hi> a <hi>Prince,</hi> who (out of His <hi>Royal Clemency</hi> to <hi>mercileſs</hi> and <hi>bloudy Traytors)</hi> has paſſ'd an <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi> upon their <hi>execrable impieties</hi> in the <hi>late Rebellion,</hi> freely giving them their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes,</hi> which by the Law of <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> were forefeited to His <hi>Juſtice.</hi> What a notorious piece of <hi>Ingratitude</hi> is it for men to <hi>Conſpire</hi> to take away that <hi>Life,</hi> which freely gave them their <hi>own?</hi> To abuſe a Mercy ſo <hi>great</hi> and <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent,</hi> that tho' they ſhould have endeavour'd to gain a <hi>good reputation</hi> by a ſincere and ſtedfaſt Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to their <hi>Prince,</hi> yet would it have been impoſſible for them to have made him a ſufficient Requital? But indeed it is no more than verefying the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Save a Thief from the Gallows, and he'le cut your Throat.</hi> But methinks it ſeems wonderfully ſtrange that the <hi>ignorance</hi> of the Multitude (after the ſad experience they have had of that <hi>Dire Rebellion)</hi> ſhould be ſo much wrought upon, as not to have ſo great a <hi>horrour</hi> as they ought, for involving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves afreſh in the ſame <hi>unhappy Troubles;</hi> eſpecially conſidering, that when the <hi>Rebels</hi> had brought the <hi>late Kings Head</hi> to the <hi>Block,</hi> the <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> was utterly loſt; the pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of which was the chief ground of that <hi>Fatal War.</hi> But ſuch is the obſtinacy of ſome, that the moſt learned of Pens cannot bring them to a better <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> (at leaſt to a better <hi>obſervance)</hi> of their <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> to their <hi>Prince;</hi> And therefore I ſhall not in the leaſt pretend to it: only I ventur'd to mind you (eſpecially now you cannot but be well diſpos'd to hear it) how <hi>vigilant</hi> that Party is upon all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and occaſions to propagate their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth Principles.</hi>
