            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of
the family of the houſe of Saul, whoſe name was Shimei, the ſon of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah:
he came forth, and curſed ſtill as he came.</p>
               <p>6. And he caſt ſtones at David, and at all the ſervants of king David: and
all the people, and all the mighty men were on his right hand, and on his
left.</p>
               <p>7. And thus ſaid Shimei when he curſed, Come out, come out thou bloody
man, and thou man of Belial:</p>
               <p>8. The Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the houſe of Saul: and
behold, thou art taken in thy miſchief, becauſe thou art a bloody man.</p>
               <p>11. And David ſaid to Abiſhai, and to all his ſervants, &amp;c. Let him alone,
and let him curſe; &amp;c. It may be that the Lord will look on mine affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and that the Lord will requite good for his curſing this day</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ODS ſtrict injunction obliges us all, to reprove ſin,
whereſoever we finde it: and as far as reproof has any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
in it, to endeavour the reducement into the right
way of all ſuch as wander from it through ignorance.
I being therfore to direct this my reprehenſion, and cenſure to you,
deſire you to accept of it, as injoyned by God himſelf: For I have
read the relation of your Arraignment in <hi>Octob:</hi> laſt, (the ſame as is
verified, and avowed under your own hand) and my conſcience tels
me, I ſhould deal unfaithfully with you, and neglect Gods command,
if I ſhould not ſtrive to convince you, of the great ſcandall, that has
been given by it to all good, and wiſe men. If I my ſelf erre, or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
my bounds in this cenſorious, redargutory addreſſe of mine:
I deſire the like freedome from you; well knowing that in many
things, we offend all: and therfore, God forbid, but I ſhould be as
readie to ask pardon, where I give offence, as to grant pardon where
I receive any. Nay I am not more forward in begging your pardon
when I know I have offended, then I am in challenging your cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
wherein I have offended, when I know not the ſame my ſelf.
Alas, it is a wofull obſtinacy in ſome men that they will not hear,
and it is as wofull a timidity in others, that they will not give juſt,
and due reprehenſions. I doubt you are hardned in your errors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſo few declare againſt you: yet I hope, this will eaſily ſink into
you, that other mens ſilence, when you are really become a publick
ſcandall, will neither be able to acquit you before God, nor diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them. This man pretends you are a ſtranger to him, that man
intimates you are belowe his reprehenſion: a third, objects, that you
are mordacious, and ſo wilfull, that you are beyond the benefit of
any ingenuous reprehenſion: but ſure, Gods command of an office
ſo juſt, and charitable, as Chriſtian objurgation is, is not ſo to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded,
or eluded. Your ſin becomes mine, upon my ſilence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I endeavour not to cure you: and my ſinfull ſilence addes to
your treſpaſſes, becauſe it renders you the more incurable. For, firſt,
All <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants are to regard you as a brother within Gods
command, and not as a ſtranger without it, for our common Mother
the State of <hi>England,</hi> and our common Mother the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:117320:3"/>
has a ſhare in you: and neceſſarily muſt ſuffer loſſe by the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of you, or gain by the reduction of you: and ſo in both theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
or conſanguinious relations (religious, and politick) you are
to be tender'd as a brother, though perhaps your face be ſtrange to
us. Nay Gods command of reprehenſion is ſo large, that he that
may be made my brother by it, though he be not ſo as yet, is capable
of, and may require at my hands all faithfull brotherly offers from
me. 2ly, If you were bred a man of Trade, and not of letters: no man,
how learned ſoever, can therfore alledge, that tis too inglorious a
task for him, to conteſt with you. Your want of literature at the
laſt day will not make you uncapable of charity, or abſolve them,
who fail in the offices of charity towards you; the duty of reproof
was not impoſed upon us by God, that we might gain victory to our
ſelves, but that we might recover ſouls to him: wherfore if any man
make uſe of reproof only for triall of his wit, and affect therein a
garland above truth: that man ſetting himſelf on work is to receive
wages from himſelf: he remains ſtill a debtor unto God, but tis not
to be expected that God ſhould be made a debtor unto him. 3ly:
others teſtifie not againſt you for fear of your maledicency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibility:
but neither are theſe ſo to be acquitted before God. For
God does not call all men in the forenoon, nor in the third, nor
fourth houre of the afternoon: it belongs to us, early and late to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh,
and advertiſe, and with patience to expect Gods time, and
good pleaſure whether he will proſper our firſt, or our latter endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
Beſides if Gods call has preceded, yet we ſtill muſt wait with
patience, for his call does not alwayes work a ſenſible change in
the firſt moment, eſpecially in men of rugged diſpoſitions, and in
thoſe things which are moſt congeniall to the ruggedneſſe of their
diſpoſitions. Laſtly, if a ſenſible, apparent change has been wrought
by Gods call, yet ſtill more patience is required of us, foraſmuch as
there is ſo much inſtability, and lubricity in the beſt men, that none
of us are abſolutely free from temporary relapſes, and ſtrange defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
at ſometimes. Theſe things therfore will charge juſtly all of
want of charity, or puſillanimous deſpondence, who ſee other mens
deviations, yet ſeek not to reclaim them, and receive ſcandals often
times, yet uſe no endeavours to amend them.</p>
            <p>But I haſten to the principall ſcope of this Letter, and to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
heads of thoſe things, for which you are lyable to reproof.</p>
            <p>1. The firſt thing, which in reading the manner of your Triall
gave me ſcandall was: your prolix urging, and repeating of very
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117320:3"/>
many impertinent things, and yet complaining withall, that a juſt,
and due freedome of ſpeech was taken from you; tis moſt evident,
(though you were not ſatisfied with your own vain loquacity) that
a multitude of frivolous things fell from you too unworthy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the meaneſt and idleſt of your Auditors, much more unworthy
to entangle a Bench of ſuch honorable, and ſage Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond was: your laying hold of divers ſhifting cavils,
and ſhufling exceptions in Law which were only fit to waſte time, and
procure trouble to the Court, (they were far from making any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
for you at all) and yet complaining at the ſame time, that the
Law was forced, and violented to your deſtruction.</p>
            <p>3. The third which convinced me of your ignorance, if not of
your impudence, was the utmoſt ſtrength of your moſt formal pleas,
and reaſons in Law: for in my minde even thoſe, though you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned
your ſelf ſtrangely preſumptuous upon the juſtice of your
cauſe, and upon your knowledge of the Law, were exceeding defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
and inſufficient.</p>
            <p>4. The 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> thing which gave me deep offence, and left you total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inexcuſable in my judgement, was your bitter raylings againſt the
Judges, nay your moſt filthy reproachings againſt all Law, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
I might almoſt ſay againſt humanity, and Divinity too; and
yet ſtill whileſt you treated your Judges as the moſt deſpicable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in the world, your complaint was, that you were moſt villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly
treated your ſelf.</p>
            <p>5. The 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> thing which deſerves a keen reproof from all honeſt
men, was your aſſayling the ſincerity of your Jurors ſo diverſly, it
was very plain that by the inſidious clamors of your diſciples, you
attempted them one way, and by other ſubtill blandiſhments you
ſeemed to winde your ſelf into their favours another way. For
though you had the hap to amuze your 12. men, there is ſcarce any
honeſt man in <hi>England,</hi> that is not moved to a great deal of diſdain
at the groſſe attempts which you made to deboſh them both wayes.</p>
            <p>Of theſe in this order.</p>
            <p>1. In your Arraignments firſt entrance being call'd upon to hold
up your hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ding to the old cuſtome and Law of <hi>England,</hi>
by way of anticipation you demand freedome of ſpeech: a thing
you could not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ubt of, provided you would not extend the bounds
of your freedome too far. But it ſhould ſeem your demand was for
freedome of ſpeech void of all bounds, and that your Judges might
put no difference betwixt matters alleaged proper for the time,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117320:4"/>
place, and triall in hand, and matters utterly improper: you muſt
have it as free for you to waſte time away, and to abuſe the Courts
patience by trifling, as to defend your ſelf by opening the true ſtate
of your cauſe, and giving judiciall anſwers to your Indictment. You
begin therfore with long harangues of what had paſſed at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
and <hi>Oxford,</hi> at ſome Arraignments of yours before the Houſe of
Peers, and Judge <hi>Heath:</hi> and then making no juſt uſe thereof: you
deſcend as cauſleſly to ſpeak againſt clandeſtine Trials, and upon
that occaſion you inform the Court, what had once been debated
betwixt M: <hi>Miles Corbet,</hi> and your ſelf at a Committee for Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
From thence you ſlide to the great exploits that were done at
<hi>Brainford</hi> againſt the Kings Army by your ſelf, and ſome few others.
From thence you digreſſe to ſome conference betwixt the Lieutenant
of the Tower, and your ſelf, wherein is laid open what faith you had
given him to be his true Priſoner. You next rove further from thence,
and inform the Court what the L: Preſident <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> and M. <hi>Cook</hi>
had pleaded for you in 1641. againſt the rigorous urging of Oaths
by the Lords of Star-Chamber: likewiſe, what your City friends
formerly had ſuggeſted for you in their Petition: what eſtate of
yours had been ſeiz'd upon by ſome Miniſters of the Parliament:
what incivility the Souldiers had ſhewed in apprehending you:
what Coll: <hi>Walter Long</hi> had ſpent the King during his impriſonment
in the Tower: what you had read in the Law-books againſt ſpeciall
Commiſſions of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer:</hi> how requiſite it was that your
Judges ſhould expoſe their Commiſſion to your exception, that their
power of judging you might ſo be ſubmitted to your power of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them.</p>
            <p>To conclude, (though you concluded not ſo) after much more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreperous
conteſtation about ſo many ſeverall impertinences, you
vouchſafe at laſt to arrive at your Trials Introduction, to wit, the firſt
ceremony of holding up your hand to the Court, and even that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
alſo muſt afford you a larger field for your eloquence to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate
in. This was your <hi>preludium</hi> in the forenoon of your firſt day:
and to trace you further through all your extravagancies, for two
entire dayes would be endleſſe: but by this <hi>preludium</hi> any man may
eaſily diſcern what leſſons were played afterwards, when your pipes
were once throughly tuned. You will perhaps ſay, though theſe
and ſome other paſſages (by you repeated more then once,) were
forrein to the main iſſue of guilty, or not guilty, yet inaſmuch as they
did ſome way tend to move commiſeration in the people, they were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117320:4"/>
not altogether unſeaſonable, or improper. But this ſuppoſes that
you were brought to the barre aſwell to work upon the multitude,
and catch the affections of the injudicious, as to ſatisfie your ſworn
Judges and Jurors in matter of Law, or Fact: which is a thing not at
all to be ſuppoſed. For you muſt needs grant, that it belongs not to
the common people that are admitted to ſee and hear, to paſſe any
judgement at all: that it belongs not to the Judges to ſee or hear, as
the common people do: that publick perſons are to deveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of private affections: that if your Judges might not look upon
you with private eyes, or acquit you of preſent guilt in regard of paſt
merits, or former ſufferings (which is not allowed to them) yet they
are not to be ſwayed at all with your bare averments of your own
merits, and ſufferings without ſufficient teſtimony, and examination
of others. You know the old Theorems of Law: Judges are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and paſſe ſentence not <hi>ſecundum allegata,</hi> bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

are in the ſame predicament, as things not exiſtent. It appears
therfore, that all theſe diſcourſes of yours, wherein ſo many houres
were conſumed, were improper, and extrajudiciall; and this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo cleerly: with what front could you pretend, and clamour as
you did, that freedom of diſcourſe was taken away from you, and
that all that was due to an Engliſh man was denyed you? Is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is it reconcileable to ſence, that you could be abridged of juſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in pleading things pertinent, and yet at the ſame time range
abroad ſo wildly, and profuſely laviſh away your oratory in things
ſo impertinent? Two entire dayes were ſpent in your Triall; and yet
it is moſt evident by the ſhort iſſue you were put upon, <hi>(viz:</hi> whether
you were the Author or no of ſuch, and ſuch Pamphlets) that as
much buſineſſe of other mens uſes commonly to be diſpatcht in a
quarter of the ſpace, as was diſpatcht then of yours. Your own Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
alſo ſet forth by your own approbation (if not order and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection)
ſhews, and ocularly demonſtrates, that in your long Triall,
neither the Commiſſioners on the Bench, nor the Counſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> at Barre
took up half ſo much time in ſpeaking, as you your ſelf did. There
can be no error in this, if we will but number your leafs, and lines of
your own panegyricall, oſtentatious Relation. Beſides not only the
prolixity, but alſo the acrimony of your language teſtifies againſt
you: for men that are reſtrained from ſpeaking, are much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
from ſpeaking inſolently, maliciouſly, and abuſively: and
the ſame Authority that checks modeſt language, wil ſerve to choak
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117320:5"/>
up, and obſtruct all immodeſt expreſſions. Sure, you were not wel
adviſed, when you ſuffered this book of your Triall to paſſe the
Preſſe: for it either contradicts you, or it ſelf; inaſmuch as in ſome
places it contains very paſſionate complaints to yours againſt the
Court, as if it triumph'd over you, and debarr'd you of a free de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
yet the whole tenor of it from one end to the other declares
amply, and pregnantly, that your Judges were by you treated as the
moſt abject captives in the world, and, as it were, dragd up and down
before the vulgar only to grace your chariot wheels. In due place I
ſhall inſtance to you, and give in particulars how inſulting you
were, how the ears of your Judges were alwayes deafned almoſt
with their own reproaches, and all other mens mouthes ſtopped with
your hyperbolicall boaſtings. Such odious ſhameleſſe things were
ſcarce ever vented by any brawler whatſoever, in any place what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
much leſſe did ever any priſoner at Barre preſume to ſpit ſuch
things in the face of Juſtice it ſelf. But my order leads me next after
your meer impertinences to your frivolous cavillations.</p>
            <p>2. I ſhall here only recite, with much brevity, ſome of your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
ſubterfuges, and demurring pretences, and then let the world
judge, whether ever any Tribunall before would ſuffer Juſtice to be
ſo bafled: or any Priſoner before ever thought it worth while to lay
hold of ſuch poore advantages. The ceremony of your hands ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
muſt firſt be explained to you; and when by its explanation it
appears harmleſs, and of a reaſonable ſignification, you will agree
to do ſomething equivalent, and <hi>tantamount,</hi> but the ceremony it
ſelf, and its ancient Authority you will not ſubmit to. For your
Judges Commiſſion, you muſt firſt be adviſed whether it be generall,
or ſpeciall: and when you are adviſed that it is not ſpeciall: yet you
muſt have leave a great while to ſhew your learning and reading
againſt ſpeciall Commiſſions. When you are to plead to your Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Treaſon (Guilty, or not Guilty:) you muſt firſt ſpend time in
pleading againſt ſuch pleading: and when that will not prevail, you
give in a conditionate, deluſory plea, ſuch as you think is good
enough for the triall to proceed upon whileſt you pleaſe, but may be
revoked at your pleaſure. When your Indictment is read, you muſt
have a copie of it, you muſt have ſpace for eight or nine dayes to put
in exceptions againſt it: you muſt have Counſell aſſigned you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
thoſe exceptions: and if theſe things be granted, (which you
know were never granted in <hi>England,</hi> or elſewhere) you will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
to make an abſolute, binding plea. When the queſtion is put,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117320:5"/>
by whom you will be tried: you will not ſay by God and your
Countrey, becauſe that is a form anciently preſcribed, but after
ſome time wrangled away, you will yeeld to the ſame in ſubſtance:
that is, you will be tried in the preſence of God by a Jury of your
Equals, according to Law. When you ſee your ſophiſms are not able
to blinde your Judges, you carp at the very Honour of your Triall:
you repine at the Bench for being adorned with ſo much learning,
and for being filled with ſo great a number of Judges, Aldermen,
Knights, Eſquires, &amp;c. no leſſe then fourty in all: nay neither your
Judges, nor the Grand Jury (though they were choiſe men alſo)
could eſcape the brands of ſuborned perſons, and conſpirators
againſt your life. When the Judges, to pacifie your impetuous noiſe
for Counſell, promiſe you ſhall have it, as ſoon as matter of Law
ariſes out of matter of Fact, and in the mean time aſſure you they
(according to their duty) will be faithfull Counſell to you, you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that your Indictment is nothing elſe but matter of Law. When
a ſecond day is granted you to produce witneſſes (a favour not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
by other Delinquents, who at their perils are to be alwayes
readie with their witneſſes to purge themſelves of any crime) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of bringing witneſſes, you begin that ſecond day with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowing
of your Plea. When you have uſed all art your ſelf in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming,
and dallying away time, you demand leave for your Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor
that he may come in upon the Court, as a freſh Reſerve of
yours. When the Petit-Jury appears to be ſworn, you are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to except againſt them your ſelf upon your own diſcretion;
you deſire your friends may be admitted alſo to except againſt
them, becauſe perhaps ſome of your Friends may know ſome of
them better then you do. When witneſſes appear to prove you the
Author of ſuch a book, you preſcribe them to ſwear to this indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall
book, <hi>viz:</hi> that this identicall book was delivered to the
Printer, and this identicall book is intimated in the Indictment.
When a ſingle witneſſe appears againſt you, though he be ſeconded
with never ſo many pregnant circumſtances, and ſtrong preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yea though others conteſt alſo to the ſame thing, only not act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ſame place, and at the ſame time; you then waive the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipall
Law of <hi>England,</hi> and prefer the Civill Law before it: tis in
vain for your Judges to cite Statutes againſt you: for either you are
wiſer then the Statutes of <hi>England,</hi> or you are a wiſer Interpreter of
the Statutes of <hi>England,</hi> then your Judges. When three competent
witneſſes depoſe againſt you as to the ſame ſeditious book, you ſay
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117320:6"/>
thoſe books were not without <hi>errataes,</hi> and tis poſſible that the ſame
book had had no ſeditious paſſages in it, had it not been for thoſe
<hi>Errataes</hi> of the Printer. When ſome of the books carried the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of your own hand upon them, you put the Atturney Generall
to his proofs that that was your hand: and if that be proved by the
Atturney, you tell him plainly, He gains nothing by it, for except
the book be proved yours otherwiſe, the ſignature of your hand
proves it not ſo. When the Printers <hi>Errataes</hi> will not help you, you
ſay the book perhaps might be miſdated, for if the book was made
and dated before the Act of Parliament (which condemned ſuch
books as ſeditious) it was not ſeditious. When the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is proved precedent to the date, you ſay, perhaps the Act was
not duely proclaimed, or elſe the copie of the Act read now, was not
examined duely by the Clerks book at <hi>Westminster,</hi> or elſe the Clerks
book at <hi>Westminſter</hi> was no true Parliament Record. Let it be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
alſo that you are proved the Author of ſuch books, and the ſame
to be treaſonable; yet ſtill you defend your ſelf with this, that in
thoſe treaſonable books, you had no treaſonable intent, and then
you are ſtill upon this guard: <hi>Mens, non Actus facit rem:</hi> The Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
none for a Treaſonable Act, except his intent be proved trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.
Alas, what is there, that can eſcape your exception? From
the Judges, and the Laws, and the Witneſſes, and the Informers,
and the Jurors, you proceed at laſt to except againſt the Door-keeper
of the Jurors. You pretend, forſooth, that the very Door-keeper has
expreſt ſomething of bitterneſſe againſt you: and therfore you move
that the Doore of the roome where the Jurors are to agree of a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
may be kept by ſome other man more impartiall towards you.
Who ever heard of ſuch dallying capritioes before in any Court of
Juſtice? who ever heard of any Judges hands bound up before by
the like nugatory cavillations of any Priſoner whatſoever? You
think your life a ſtrange prey, that all the world ſhould be ſuch
greedie hunters of it: but I think your ſoul a ſtrange Purgatory ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that ſo many jealous, uncharitable thoughts, like <hi>Zim,</hi> and
<hi>Ohim,</hi> ſhould be diſquieting haunters of it. The Parliament is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
and conjured againſt you, becauſe ſome Members of it have
been provoked by, and put at a diſtance with you by ſome enmity of
yours: The Atturny Generall is no competent Proſecutor againſt
you, becauſe he is a Burgeſſe of Parliament: The Judges are except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt, becauſe they are created by the Parliament: and all the
reſt of the Bench are to be ſuſpected, becauſe, forſooth, they may be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117320:6"/>
miſlead, and over-born by theſe creatures of the Parliament. Thus
to you juſtice can never be adminiſtred, till the world be new mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nay nor yet ſo, except you have the new moulding of it. But I
pray tell me, do all theſe objections, and prolongations of yours ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of a dejected, oppreſſed ſpirit, or could they proceed from an
impriſon'd, over-awed tongue? <hi>Judicet Orbis.</hi> Surely you did direct
theſe futilous, empty umbrages of reaſon either to ſway wiſer judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or onely to infect, and trump the ruder multitude: if the firſt,
you render your ſelf a very deliring man notwithſtanding all your
reading of the Law, which you vaunt ſo much of: if the ſecond, you
merit the brand of a frontleſſe impoſtor, and ſeem to prefer <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi>
politicks before <hi>Machiavels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. I come now from your impertinencies, and cavils to the more
rationall, and formall part of your defence: but what true ſtrength
there was in your beſt arguments, and pleas; let the world judge,
and decide.</p>
            <p>You begin with the Commiſſion, by which the Court ſits upon
you, and is qualified to abſolve or condemne you. You argue ſtifly
that you ought to hear it read, and paſſe your cenſure of it; nay
you pretend all other Commiſſions, beſides thoſe ordinary ones,
wherby the Countrey Aſſizes, and Quarterly Seſſions are held, are
againſt Law.</p>
            <p>By this, it ſhould ſeem, the Judges come upon the Bench to be
judged of by Priſoners at the Barre, aſwell as Priſoners at the Barre
come to be judged by the Bench. For if the partie arraigned may
freely queſtion, and diſpute the Authority before which he is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned,
there muſt be ſome other Court to determine betwixt him,
and his Judges, or elſe he and his Judges being both cloathed with
equalty of juriſdiction, muſt depart upon equall terms, without any
judgement paſſed on either ſide. And if ſo, what iſſue, what effect
can Juſtice have? I do not deny, that a Priſoner may be wrongfully
condemned, I do not denie that a priſoner ſo wronged is remedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
I onely deny, the Priſoner to be a competent Judge of ſuch
wrongs. Upon this reaſon it ſtands, that a Priſoner may appeal to
a higher Judge from the lower, but his right of appeal derives to
him no right of Judgement: nor can appeals lie but onely from infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Courts. For if there were a freedome of judging due to Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
aſwell as of appealing, all impeachments, and criminall char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
would be endleſſe, and utterly uncapable of determination.
Commiſſions hereupon are directed to the Judges, not to Priſoners,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117320:7"/>
and being Warrants for the Judges to proceed upon, and to juſtifie
their ſentences, not rules, or Laws by which Priſoners are to ſtand
or fall, they ought to be read, and examined by the Judges, but not
ſo by Priſoners. Beſides, though it may be proper for a Priſoner in
ſome caſes to appeal at laſt from his Judges, where they have not
rightly purſued their Commiſſion: you he cannot plead at firſt to the
vertue of the Commiſſion, foraſmuch, as in ſo doing he appeals not
to, but from the Supreme Authority: nor can he plead want of legall
form in the Commiſſion, foraſmuch as that pertains to the danger,
or indemnity of his Judges, not of him: and if he were as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in it, as his Judges (which he cannot be) yet twere abſurd
that his judgement ſhould be made equall, or ſuperior to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Commiſſioners. Tis by you taken for granted, that the
ſpeciall Commiſſions of <hi>Oier,</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> in the North (which were
firſt granted by <hi>Hen:</hi> the 8th: and after continued by all his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors)
were illegal, and unformall: if we ſhould grant this too (as we
do not) you may conclude, that the Commiſſioners which acted
thereupon, were anſwerable for acting without a ſufficient warrant:
but you cannot conclude notwithſtanding, that any Delinquent, or
Defendant ſuffered unjuſtly therby, or was condemned contrary to
Law therupon. Moreover, it is high arrogance in you to condemne
all extraordinary Commiſſions of <hi>Oier,</hi> and <hi>Terminer;</hi> and to ſay that
the Stat: of <hi>Weſtmiſt:</hi> the 2d. (where the Supreme power of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
King, Peers, and Commons, was preſent, and did cooperate) by
which ſuch extraordinary Commiſſions were eſtabliſht, was an irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
innovation. You may as juſtifiably ſay, that <hi>Ed:</hi> the 3d. and
all the Kings, and Parliaments ſince to this day have deſerved your
correction, and ſubjected themſelves to your vile exprobration, for
that they alſo have confirmed, and kept in force the ſame irrational
innovation. What an unlimited liberty do you take to your ſelf?
ſuch things are irrationall Innovations, becauſe you affirm, they are
contrary to <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> and yet you know well, the power and
Majeſty of <hi>England,</hi> the ſame as created <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelf, by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Statutes, and by a continuall confirmation of practiſe for the
ſpace of above 300. yeers, have declared them neither to be innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
nor contrariant to <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> Wherfore ſince your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot bow to any, nor can pay a reverent ſubmiſſion to the
Authority of ſo many Parliaments, or to the prudence of ſo many
ages, what ſatisfaction are you capable of? You will ſay this Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
in 1641. when it conſiſted of 4. or 5. hundred Members, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117320:7"/>
when it was an undeflowred Counſell condemned, and aboliſht the
Northren Court. Let it be ſo: that particular Court had declined
from its primitive inſtitution, and ſo was thought fit to be diſſolved:
but you know after much debate about the abuſes of extraordinary
Commiſſions in generall, and after a full poizing of all that could be
urged on both ſides, nothing was concluded further againſt them;
and ſo the Parliaments reſolution at laſt makes as much againſt
you, as its debate at firſt makes for you, <hi>Exceptio in non exerptis firmat
regulam.</hi> More was delivered at your Triall by the Atturny Generall,
and the Judges touching this ſubject: and that this Commiſſion by
which you were to be judged, was not ſpeciall but generall: I ſhall
not therfore adde any more at preſent upon the ſubject, but refer you
to your own memory. I ſhall onely ſupply this advertiſement, that
whatſoever illegality can be objected againſt ſpeciall Commiſſions,
it more befits and imports the Commiſſioners, then their Priſoners
arraigned before them, to diſpute the ſame. And wheras you appeal
(as it were) from this preſent devirginated Parliament, to that
which ſate in 1641. which acted ſo gallantly, as you ſay, for univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
liberty; and not for ſelf-intereſt: you muſt be reminded, that
none but Parliaments ought to judge of Parliaments: and that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
become no Parliaments when they are liable to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of private perſons. You may be alſo further reminded, that
the Parliament of 1641. which was ſo pure, yet in 1642. afforded a
great number of revolting Members to the King: ſuch as you your
ſelf then judged revolters. Nay the ſame Parliament in 1647. afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
yet many more revolters in your conſtruction, for your firſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
againſt the Parliament was, that it did not then purge it ſelf of
the degenerate Members that aſſembled with <hi>M. H: Pelham.</hi> This is
therfore a contradictorious humor in you to decry the Parliament
in 1649. that you may extoll the Parliament in 1641, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your own former judgement, the Parliament of 1649. is
only the unrevolting remainder of the Parliament in 1641.</p>
            <p>The next thing you complaine of, is: that you are not arraigned
in your own County at the Aſſizes, and that you were not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by the Civill Officer, although the Nation be now in peace,
and you one that neither ſought to flie, nor make reſiſtance. Here you
ſuppoſe that you are an ordinary perſon, that theſe are ordinary
times, that the crime you are Indicted for is an ordinary crime, and
ſo you infer, that this apprehenſion, and arraignment of yours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extraordinary is againſt the common right and Freedom of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117320:8"/>
Nation. But. 1. for your perſon, you are not a common malefactor;
you are preſumed, upon no light grounds, to be the Head, or one of
the heads of a dangerous, and deſperate faction; and faction that has
already been in Arms, and is ſtill watching new opportunities of
riſing again in Arms; a faction that has uſed all endeavours to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
divide, and deboſh the Army, and to effect the ſame is willing
to combine with Royaliſts, or any forreigne Invaders whatſoever:
the Crime charged upon you is as hainous as can be, tis vigorouſly
attempting by all manner of practiſes, and correſpondencies, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by ſeditious Pamphlets, to imbroyl this Nation in a third Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
war, and ſo to ſubvert the ſettled Form of Government. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Wars have been exceeding bloody, and long it was before the
Nations wounds could be ſtanched, wherfore another tearing open
of the ſame wounds, would in probability make them more mortal,
and more hard to be healed, then they were before. 3. For the times
they are not ſo calm, and ſecure, as your party, together with the
Royaliſts, would fain make us to believe they are, to the end that
you might the better incenſe the people againſt Taxes and Exciſe,
and ſo wreſt our Arms out of our hands: We have not indeed En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
flouriſht againſt Enſignes in the field, nor weapons openly
drawn againſt weapons, but every Summer almoſt we have new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections,
and even now we keep our Colours unfurl'd, that we
may keep yours furl'd: and our Swords remain unſheathed to daunt
you from unſheathing yours. <hi>Non recurrendum est ad extraordinaria in
iis quae fleri poſſunt per ordinaria:</hi> we grant you ſo much: but you muſt
then as freely grant to us; that where ordinary remedies are not ſo
ſafe, and available, we muſt have reſort to ſuch, as are extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.
Judge <hi>Jenkins</hi> never read this maxime of the Law to you, that
a private miſchief is rather to be choſen, then a publick inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
For certainly neither he, nor you would ſo confound perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
all perſons, caſes, and times, and be ſo oblivious of all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and reaſon of State, as to put a private mans liberty in ballance
againſt publick ſafetie, and to value ſome formalities in practiſe
equall with the higheſt of all Laws, if ever you had ſeriouſly ſtudied
this incontroulable, unerring maxime. Beſides, were that Law by
which you challenge an ordinary Trial at the Aſſizes in <hi>Surrey,</hi> every
way equivalent to the Empreſſe of all Statutes, Cuſtomes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
<hi>(Salus Populi):</hi> yet neither ſo would your challenge hold:
foraſmuch as your Treaſon (if proved againſt you) was committed
not onely in <hi>Surrey</hi> where perhaps your books were written, but in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117320:8"/>
               <hi>London</hi> alſo where your books were Printed, yea in every County of
the Land where they were publiſht, and diſperſt amongſt the people.
There is not a Pariſh in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> but may appear to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
you for a generall diſturber of Peace, and mover of ſedition, and
one that has moſt deſperately conjured againſt his whole Countrey,
and every part of it.</p>
            <p>The 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>: thing you argue againſt is the plea of Guilty, or not Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
tis againſt the Petition of Right, you ſay, that any man ſhould
be compell'd to anſwer Interrogatories againſt himſelf: that the
Star-Chamber Court was aboliſht for forcing ſuch Interrogatories
upon us: laſtly, that the practiſe of Chriſt himſelf, and his Apoſtles,
diſcharges us from anſwering to ſuch Interogatories. You run here
into a groſſe miſtake, for that you diſtinguiſh not betwixt the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
framing, and inforcing of ſome ſpeciall Interrogatories upon
oath, where the crime is not of publick concernment, and where
other proof is failing, and where they extend further then to the
point in iſſue: and demanding an affirmative, or negative without
oath to the direct point in iſſue, where according to valid evidence
a legall charge of publick concernment is preferred. If theſe things
were diſtinguiſht, you would not finde any thing in the Petition of
Right repugnant to the old Interrogatory of Guilty, or not Guilty.
For ſince the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>: of K: <hi>Charls</hi> Delinquents have been tryed, and held
to this old plea, as well as before in all ages, and none of our Judges
ever yet ſprung any ſuch new interpretation, as you now ſpring,
contrary to the cuſtome of all times, and all Nations. The odium
that now lyes upon ſome Interrogatories has been contracted either
by the fraud of the party interrogating, or obſtinacy of the party
interrogated: wherupon the ſweet-temper'd Law of <hi>England,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the miſchief that might ariſe from either of theſe parties, that
neither the one might ſtrain queſtions too high, nor the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
them too far, finds out a channell in the midſt of the ſtreame,
neither totally abandoning them, nor giving too wilde a licenſe to
them. The civill Law is very rigorous, and in many places uſes
racks to extort evidence from ordinarie Delinquents, where there is
but moderate preſumption againſt them: and yet doubtleſſe this
rigor is more ſalubrious, then ſuch a fondneſſe as you now contend
for, when you would reject all Examinations in all caſe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
The Star-Chamber was grown to a great abuſe of Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
in private Suits and differences, and was therfore wiſely abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht:
but this proves not, that the firſt inſtitution of the ſame Court,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117320:9"/>
yea and its long continuation after under ſo many wiſe Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
was unpolitick. For in times of Reformation it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
that even good things, when they have been far deboſhed, are
prudently layed aſide, and ſometimes juſtly burnt, yea ground to
powder, and made ſubjects of our deteſtation. Well therfore might
the Lord Preſident (whom) I ſhall alwayes mention with as much
honour, as you with contempt, nay whom your contempt confirms
to me to be the more honorable) well might He deteſtate Star-Chamber
Examinations, as they had been abuſed in the late Kings
dayes, and yet not declare himſelf now an abſolute enemy to all
Examinations whatſoever. The obſtinate ſilence of Delinquents,
when they will not confeſſe, nor deny their guilt, is ever taken for a
Confeſſion not onely by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> but by the Laws of all
other Nations: and 'twas more favour to you then you could chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
from your Judges, that your plea, which you would not allow
to be negative, was not taken for affirmative againſt you. Tis true,
if it were ſin in a priſoner to confeſſe his guilt, it would be ſin in a
Magiſtrate to preſſe him to ſuch a Confeſſion; but ſince tis rather a
ſervice to the God of truth, to affirm a truth in the midſt of danger,
I mean ſuch a truth, as is of more advantage to juſtice, and to the
ſafety of a State, then it is of diſadvantage to the party confeſſing,
what rigor is in the Law, or in the Judge, that requires ſuch a plea
from the priſoner? For the objection, that evill minded men will
deny guilt contrary to truth, of which untrue denyall the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
by this means becomes the occaſion: tis anſwered eaſily: in as
much as he which is no proper cauſe, though he be an occaſion of
offence, offends not therein: in as much alſo as the Magiſtrate is not
to prevent an uncertain offence by declining a certain duty: nor will
the Law preſume all men falſe, becauſe many are not true. As for
our Saviours example, who you ſay being examined before <hi>Pilate,</hi>
would not by his own confeſſion, or aſſerting of a truth, make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
obnoxious to judgement: It ſhews you as pſeudodox in Divinity,
as you are in Law. I ſhall by and by make it appear, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
who neither had any guilt to confeſſe, nor did refuſe to give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to any pertinent, judiciall queſtions of the Magiſtrate, nor had
any hope of eſcaping condemnation by being ſilent, is very much
blaſphemed by you.</p>
            <p>A 4th. thing, for which you conceive your arguments are valid,
and concludent, is allowance of Counſell, as alſo time for eight or
nine dayes to conſult with them, before you anſwer your Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117320:9"/>
Your reaſon is, becauſe you know not the formalities of Law,
as neither having Latin, nor French to read the books, and you ſay
tis a great deal of nicity and danger for an ignorant man to be lockt
up to ſingle formalities. The Judges tell you, that when matter of
Law ariſes out of matter of Fact, you ſhall have Counſell aſſigned
you; that till ſuch matter ariſe, they are your ſworn Counſell, and
are bound to be indifferent betwixt the State, and you: and they
will take care that no niceties, nor ſingle formalities ſhall overthrow
you. You do as good as reply, that becauſe you are void of Latin,
and French, you muſt have Counſell; and becauſe they are partiall,
and you dare neither truſt their Offices, nor Oaths, you muſt have
Counſell ſuch as you dare truſt: the ſumme is this: becauſe you are
ignorant of the practiſe of Law, you may rail at your Judges, and
becauſe you may rayl at your Judges, you may claim time, and
other Counſell beſides them, of your own chooſing: if you were not
as unskill'd in the theory, as you are in the practiſe of the Law, you
would not upon all occaſions ſo often infiſt upon inconveniencies
likely to enſue to your ſelf, and take no notice of publick miſchiefs.
You would then be ſatisfied, that your Judges ought rather to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of a miſchief to you, then of an inconvenience to the State: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
you perpetually urge them to admit of miſchief to the State,
rather then inconveniences unto you. You pretend in the next place,
that your Indictment is long, and conſiſts wholly of matter of Law:
and therfore time and Counſell ought to be aſſigned you. Your
Judges anſwer you again, that though the Indictment be long, yet
you need not charge your memory with every part of it, the main
matter of it is very brief, and no other but matter of Fact: <hi>viz:</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or no, you were the Author of the ſeverall books therein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated.
Now no ſtudie of Law in <hi>England,</hi> neither that which is
publiſht in Engliſh, nor that which is lockt up from the vulger in-Latin
and French, can avail you in this matter, you may perfectly
inform your Counſell whether you compos'd thoſe books, or no,
but your Counſell can inform you nothing at all therein. You ſtill
alledge, that after proof of the fact, it may bee too late for Counſell
to aſſiſt you: and you are not able now to give anſwer without
Counſell, becauſe you knew not before what would be the matter of
your Indictment. I wiſh you would at laſt remember, that the Judges
are not to conſider onely, what is moſt behoofull for you, but what
is moſt behoofull for you, and the State: but ſtill you continue your
error in this, that, you ſuppoſe your Indictment to be meer matter
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117320:10"/>
of Law, when as you might as well have pretended that it was all
Mathematicks, or Metaphyſicks, as all Law. For is there any impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
at preſent for you to anſwer without Counſell whether theſe
were your books, or no: becauſe you knew not before, what you
were to anſwer to? When you ſay, your Counſell may come too
late after confeſſion of the Fact, your meaning is plain: tis inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thereby, that when you have diſowned, or owned a thing, they
cannot procure you a new liberty to own, or diſown it the ſecond
time, and ſo not being able to nullifie your anſwer; they cannot
procure you new Counſell, or new reſpite for eight or nine dayes
more to give in a new Anſwer: but when you ſay tis impoſſible for
you upon the ſudden, and without advice of Counſell to own, or
diſown books, you ſeem very dark to me, I cannot dive into your
meaning. You come now to precedents, and ſay firſt, that Ju: <hi>Heath</hi>
at Oxford allowed you Counſell before pleading. The Judges An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
might give you full ſatisfaction herein. For, 1. <hi>Heath</hi> well
enough underſtood that your charge was not Treaſon: 2ly, if it were
Treaſon, He underſtood, as well, that the Parliament had more
priſoners of the Kings, then the King had of the Parliaments, and
ſo the retaliation would turn to the diſadvantage of the King. 3ly,
The proceedings at <hi>Oxford</hi> are no fit rules for our Courts at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
nor is it congruous that you who then fought againſt <hi>Heath,</hi>
and his confederates, for ſubverting Law, ſhould now cite his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
at <hi>Oxford</hi> for Law, and bring us to relye upon him as a main
pillar of Juſtice. For another precedent, you cite the Parliament in
the Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> Caſe, who, you ſay, had Counſell aſſigned him
before pleading, but this is contradicted by Juſtice <hi>Jermyn:</hi> and He
better informs you, that the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> before pleading had
no Counſell granted Him: and if He had, the Parliament was not
ſo ſubject to the common rules of Law, as inferior Courts are. Your
3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>: precedent alledges that Major <hi>Rolph</hi> had Counſell allowed him
by the Lord Ch: Baron <hi>Welde</hi> in a Charge of Treaſon before the
Grand Jury had paſt upon Him. But the Anſwers of your Judges
clearly avoid the force of this allegation; for firſt, it is no more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to this Court what was done by the Lord Ch: Baron in <hi>Rolphs</hi>
Caſe, then upon what reaſon it was ſo done. If Counſell was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
it may be <hi>Rolph</hi> confeſſed the Charge, or there might be ſome
other difference in the Caſe: and ſo the allowance of Counſel might
be legall. But 2ly, ſuppoſe it to be illegall, and then it has no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
force upon this Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Court which is ingaged to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117320:10"/>
juſtice according to the form of the Common Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
may not ſo ſafely follow one example varying from the old
uſage, as they may a thouſand keeping more cloſe to the ſame.</p>
            <p>In the 5th. place, you ſtrive to invalidate the States witneſſes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there are none but ſingle witneſſes now produced againſt you:
and the validity of ſingle witneſſes is taken away by 2. Statutes of
<hi>Ed:</hi> 6. To this the Judges anſwer, that the Statutes of <hi>Ed:</hi> 6. are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
by a later Stat: of 1. and 2. of <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> That alſo by the
Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> where Treaſons are triable thereby, one
witnes is ſufficient, eſpecially when there are ſeveral facts of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
nature, and ſeverall teſtimonies given in to each reſpective
fact. But if ſingle witneſſes be not ſufficient, yet ſtill in this caſe of
yours, beſides a concurrence of circumſtances, and a triplication of
witneſſes to ſeverall facts of the ſame nature; and other ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions,
there wants not the compleat number of 2. or 3. witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to one, and the ſame matter, and ſuch as lie under no juſt or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
exception.</p>
            <p>In the 6th. place therfore ſuppoſing the books proved to be yours,
yet you ſay, there might be <hi>Errataes</hi> either in the dating, or Printing
of them: and you are not to ſuffer for other mens errors. Here is a
great weight hang'd upon a ſmall threed: you muſt not be admitted
to be the Author of ſuch, and ſuch treaſons, becauſe there is a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
a very remote poſſibility, that you were not the Author of
them. You ſtrike, and wound a man that dies immediately, and
have nothing to plead for your ſelf, but a meer diſtant poſſibility
that the man might have ſome other mortall inward diſeaſe, of
which he would have falne down dead at the ſame inſtant, though
your hand had not been upon him. This plea will not hold good,
you are here the affirmant, and the proof lies on your ſide, you muſt
make it appear by Chirurgions, and Phyſitians, that your blowe
was not mortall, and that there was indeed ſome other mortall
cauſe, or elſe your meer alledged poſſibility will advantage you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all. And if one poſſibility in that caſe will not acquit you,
how ſhould you be acquitted in this Indictment, where many ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
paſſages in many ſeverall books are charged againſt you, and
you have nothing to ward them all, but poſſibility upon poſſibility
that all thoſe ſeditious paſſages might be cauſed by ſo many ſeveral
miſtakes of the Printers? You having no proofs, nor colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions
to offer, that there were indeed any ſuch miſtakes? He
that affirms (whether he be Plaintiffe, or Defendant, if the matter
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117320:11"/>
affirmed be very important) muſt prove, ſo far as he affirms, this is a
rule in Law, and Logick not to be diſpenſed with. And thereupon
the Defendant, if by good ſpecialty it has been proved by the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe,
that money was lent, ſhall not avoid the Action, by pleading
payment, and ſatisfaction given, unleſſe he prove, and make the
ſame evident. Away then with theſe toyes of your Printers poſſible
<hi>Errataes:</hi> away likewiſe with the poſſible miſdating of your books.
For the Act of <hi>July</hi> laſt did not ſo much make, as declare your books
treaſonable: and you know in my L. of <hi>Straffords</hi> Caſe, when he inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon this, that where there was no Law, therewas no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion:
twas ſoon returned to him for anſwer, That endeavours to
ſubvert ſettled Government, was againſt an internall Law, if there
were none written againſt it, being <hi>malum in ſe,</hi> not <hi>quia prohibitum:</hi>
and for that reaſon every man in ſuch tranſgreſſions without writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Law, is a Law to himſelf. It was alſo further preſſed to him, that
after the Statute of the 25. <hi>Ed:</hi> 3. wherein Treaſons were ſpecially
enumerated, the Parliament nevertheleſſe had attainted divers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents,
whoſe Treaſons were not enumerated in that Satute, &amp; it
was no relief to the offendors to plead, that they had offended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
warning, and were made the firſt examples of publick ſeverity.
There is nothing more notorious then this, that the Peoples ſafetie
is ſupreme to all Judiciall Laws, as well in order of time, as in order
of Nature: and that as it was, the prime judiciall Law ingraven in
our breaſts at the Creation: ſo it ought to be the moſt fundamentall
Law inrolled in our publick treaſuries.</p>
            <p>The 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prop of our cauſe is, that you are only acouſed, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
for words, and by ſeverall Statutes, you ſay, of <hi>Hen:</hi> 4. Q.
<hi>Mary,</hi> and Q. <hi>Eliz:</hi> it is manifeſted, that they in thoſe dayes deteſted
the making of words, or writing to be Treaſon. He that rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes,
rightly delivers, and teaches truth: but you relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a contrary art, an art of confounding things, not of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
render your ſelf juſtly ſuſpected, that your aime is ſubtilly to
infuſe, and inſpire falſhoods into your diſciples, not to hold forth,
or teach truths. You cannot but know there is ſometimes a wide
difference in words, yea in the ſame words; that ſome words ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
more then others, and at ſometimes ſound forth greater matters
then at others. For example, words in writing are more permanent,
then words ſpoken: and words written are of a more tranſient na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
then words printed, foraſmuch as they intimate leſſe of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and premeditation: and the ſame words ſpoken, written, or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117320:11"/>
printed by a diſcontented man, or at the point of death, or directed
unto perſons aggrieved, carry much more weight in them, and uſe
to make deeper impreſſion, then they would if they had been utter'd
by another perſon, upon another occaſion, unto men of another
condition. Therfore the Prophet, who regards ſome mens words no
more then the crackling of thorns under a pot, or croaking of frogs
in a pudle: yet likens other mens words to ſharp arrows, and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd
darts, yea, and other mens counſels to the venome of aſps, and
to the eggs of cockatrices. <hi>Adonijah</hi> had a requeſt to preſent to his
brother <hi>Solomon,</hi> and for the more reverence ſake He would uſe the
mediation of <hi>Solomons</hi> mother therein: the matter alſo of his requeſt
was onely for a wife, for a wife of ordinary parentage, who in Law
could have no pretenſion to the Crown: Howſoever <hi>Solomon</hi> who
found a great danger wrapped up in this plauſible ſupplication, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes
further nevertheleſſe, and by the ſentence of his oraculous
breaſt, that ſame deſigne which deſerved death, and was treaſonable
in his brother ſupplicating, was ſimple, and altogether inoffenſive
in his mother interceding. <hi>Achitophel</hi> was onely of Counſell with
<hi>Abſolom,</hi> we finde not that He furniſht Horſes and Arms, or raiſed
men with his manifeſtoes, yet doubtleſſe his words were more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
to <hi>David</hi> at ſuch a time, then the ſwords of ten thouſand other
Revolters; and <hi>David</hi> was more earneſt with God to diſappoint the
inductions of <hi>Achitophels</hi> tongue, then to rout and defeat all the
other brigades, and ſtratagems of his Son <hi>Abſolom. Tarquin</hi> when his
Son conſulted with him about the deſtruction of a neighbour State,
conveighed his fatall, ſubverſive plots by ſignes, and dumb geſtures:
for even by doing execution with his ſtaffe upon the higheſt grown,
and faireſt Lilies in the garden, He ſufficiently taught, and inſtructed
a young Traytor to deſpoil a Common-wealth of its moſt potent,
and moſt politick Grandees. What <hi>Tarquin</hi> did without words, or
writings againſt a forrein Enemy, may be practiſde neerer at home
by an inteſtine conſpirator to the ruin of his own Countrey, and
ſhall we ſay that no Law ought to take hold of ſuch a conſpirator,
becauſe his treaſons did not amount to ſo much as words, or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings?
Good Sir, ſtudy the ſuperior Laws more, and the inferior leſſe,
at leaſtwiſe when you have attained skill enough to render to every
private man what is his due in chattels reall, and perſonall, make a
further progreſſe, and ſtrive to ſatisfie your ſelf in that which is the
due of the whole State, and concerns our generall preſervation.
<hi>Mounſiur Du Bartas,</hi> as He is Engliſhed, advertiſes well (you may
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117320:12"/>
finde Law in verſe ſometimes, as well as in <hi>Litleton)</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Treaſons are like the Cockatrices eye,</l>
                  <l>If they foreſee they kill, foreſeen they dye.</l>
               </q>
The ſtory of the Baſilisk perhaps is not to be credited in Phyſicks,
yet it affords us this wholſome mythologie in Politicks, that when
we come within any neer diſtance of Traytors (where their deſigns
like poyſonous beams of the eye may poſſibly reach us) we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to ſurprize, or be ſurprized, to anticipate, or be anticipated.
Away then with all your niceties in Law, wherby you retard juſtice,
if our ſafetie cannot be provided for without ſome incommodity of
yours, nor the abſolute Empreſſe of all Laws be ſerved, and obeyed
without infringing ſome priviledge of yours: you muſt give us leave
to prefer the being of <hi>England,</hi> before the well-being of any Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
nay the well-being of <hi>England,</hi> before the being of any Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman
whatſoever. Two whole dayes are now conſumed in one
iſſue of yours, (whether ſuch books were yours or no) and 2. whole
months had been conſumed, if all your Arguments of dilation and
reſpite had been hearkned unto: but if ſuch a priviledge be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to every priſoner in caſes of Treaſon: what unprofitable, unef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
things will juſtice, and judgement become in <hi>England?</hi> how
will Treaſons like Hydraes-heads ſpring forth? whileſt one Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
is upon his triall, ten more will ſtart up in his place: and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there will not be found Judges enough, or the Judges will not
find time enough to arraigne any conſiderable part of them. If words
could not amount to Treaſon, <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and <hi>Adonijah</hi> would as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
purge themſelves, as you can, and ſo will a thouſand other delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents:
but if you will grant that <hi>Adonijah</hi> might couch Treaſon in
an humble Petition for a wife, and <hi>Achitophel</hi> do the like in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to his Maſters ſons, grant alſo that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> may
be as ſevere againſt ſuch Traitors, as the Laws of the Jews were. And
for all your other ſubterfuges, except you think your ſelf a better
pleader then that <hi>Gilonite</hi> was, you may well think, his would have
been as legall as yours are: grant him ſuch a Triall, as you claim,
and as much prolongation of time, and he will make his cauſe as
fair as yours: nay leave him to be his own Judge (as you in effect
challenge to be) and he will juſtifie <hi>Abſoloms</hi> defeated Army, and
prove them, as holy Martyrs, as you do your <hi>Burford</hi> brethren. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
alſo, that there is now more Law againſt you for ſeditious
books, then there was againſt <hi>Adonijah,</hi> for petitioning his brother:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117320:12"/>
and conſider withall that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> now, are not therein
more rigid then they were in former times. You profeſſe your
ſelf exact in all the body of our Engliſh Law (except only in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
formalities of it) therfore I queſtion not, you have read <hi>Burtons</hi>
Caſe in the 10th: of <hi>H:</hi> 7. the Duke of <hi>Norfolks</hi> Caſe in the 13. of <hi>Eliz:</hi>
together with <hi>Owens</hi> Caſe in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of K: <hi>James:</hi> and you know
theſe (with divers others cited againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> ſince the
beginning of this Parliament) do inform you ſufficiently, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have ſuffered for meerly traitrous words, even when no further
traitrous act, or intent was proved againſt them. Correct therfore at
laſt your own impudent arrogance, by taking notice that there is
nothing due to you, but what is due to every man in <hi>England:</hi> and
that if every man in <hi>England</hi> ſhall baffle Law, as you do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
accuſe the preſent Government, of Tyranny, and uſurpation,
becauſe it refuſes to be baffled: there remains nothing but that we
all diſſolve into our firſt chaos of confuſion.</p>
            <p>Your 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>: help, or ſtrength upon which you reſt, is the power of
your 12 Jurors. For you firſt pull down the Judges from their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall
as meer ciphers, and as Clerks that have nothing to do, but
to cry, Amen: and then into their ſeats you promote your 12. men,
wherupon you grow confident, that this gratification of yours, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with your condiſcending to be their City brother, will bring
them to your devotion, and cauſe them to imploy their new given
juriſdiction only to the advantage of the giver. We perceive hereby
plainly the ſubſtance of your Levelling philoſophy to be briefly this:
The Judges becauſe they underſtand Law, are to be degraded, and
made ſervants to the Jurors: but the Jurors, becauſe they underſtand
no Law, are to be mounted aloft, where they are to adminiſter ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to the whole Kingdom. The Judges becauſe they are commonly
Gentlemen by birth, and have had honorable education, are to be
expoſed to ſcorn: but the Jurors, becauſe they be commonly Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,
bred up illiterately to handy crafts, are to be placed at the
helme. And conſequently Learning and gentle extraction, becauſe
they have been in eſteem with all Nations from the beginning of the
world till now, muſt be debaſed; but ignorance, and ſordid birth
muſt aſcend the chair, and be lifted up to the eminenteſt offices, and
places of power. Coblers muſt now practiſe Phyſick inſtead of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters;
Tradeſmen muſt get into Pulpits inſtead of Divines, and plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
muſt ride to the Seſſions inſtead of Juſtices of the Peace. The
pretence of levelling is to put all men upon an equall floore, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117320:13"/>
to the inferior ſo much as may match him with his ſuperior,
and taking from the ſuperior ſo much as may match him with his
inferior: and this is ſufficiently heretical in policie. But the intention
of our Levellers, we ſee, is more diametrically oppoſite to the order
of Nature, for it leaves an inequalitie amongſt men as great as ever;
It does not partially alter, but totally croſſe Divine Providence,
whileſt it elevates that which was depreſſed, &amp; depreſſes that which
was elevated: and ſo makes that the Head which was the Foot; and
that the foot, which was the Head. The turbulent Kentiſh ſpirits that
followed <hi>Cade,</hi> and <hi>Tyler,</hi> as they intended the ruine of all men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
born, and qualified, ſo they profeſſed their intention, and upon
all occaſions fell foule upon any, whom they found guilty of Ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns
and pens: but our modern perturbators intend one thing, but
profeſſe another; their myſtery is to deſtroy Law under pretext of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
and to ſupplant Liberty under pretext of Law. You which
ſometimes would appear the grand Patron of Law, yet at other
times deride the whole profeſſion of Lawyers, revile all the Benches
of Juſtice at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> ſpurn at Statutes more then 500. yeers old,
ſet at nought the wiſeſt of our Kings, and Parliaments, yea and the
moſt ſalubrious Acts that ever our Kings and Parliaments paſſed.
If any Law croſſes you, you break through it as great flies uſe to do
through copwebs: tis ſufficient for you to ſay 'twas a part of the
<hi>Norman</hi> yoke, or an irrationall innovation: nay ſome of our ancient
cuſtomes, ſuch as holding up of hands at the barre, are ſo beyond all
exception, that no man can ſee why they ſhould be unſuitable to
your phancie, but onely becauſe they are ancient, and bear the ſtamp
of Authority. You a priſoner judge, and condemne your Judges for
going againſt Law: and yet nothing can be more againſt Law, then
for Judges to be ſo judged, and condemned by priſoners; eſpecially
when the ſenſe of the Law alſo is manifeſtly diſtorted by ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
for upholding things illegall, and oppoſing things moſt legal.
The like may be ſaid of Liberty, that alſo as well as Law finds you a
propugner in ſhew, but an impugner indeed; you bear a buckler in
one hand to defend it ſeemingly, but a ſword in the other hand to
wound it really. You had the breeding of an Apprentice to inable
you for Trade, and want Latin and French to inable you for Law,
or for the true underſtanding of its terms: yet you nevertheleſſe
muſt interpret Law to the Judges, and by your interpretation make
them meer Ciphers; and this is your birth-right due to you, as an
Engliſhman: when as the Judges notwithſtanding, becauſe perhaps
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:117320:13"/>
you deny them to be Engliſhmen, or to have any ſhare in your birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
have nothing to do but to ſubmit to your magiſteriall Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation;
by your doctrine the Flower of the Nation muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to the bran, or elſe Libertie cannot proſper: the Gentleman
muſt be order'd at the pezants diſcretion, the Judge muſt do the
mean office of a Clerk, and cry Amen to the Juryman, (which all hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
have judged villanous, and ſervile) or elſe villanous ſervili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is introduced amongſt us. But if Liberty be a publick, common
benefit, does it not appertain to the Gentleman, as well as to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zant,
and to the Judge as well as to the Juror? nay does it not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the ſecuring, and preſerving (as far as is poſſible) of every
man in every due right? or is there not ſomething that is the proper
intereſt of a Gentleman <hi>quatenus</hi> a Gentleman? and of a Judge <hi>quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
a Judge, as well as there is of a pezant <hi>quatenus</hi> a pezant, and
of a Juror, <hi>quatenus</hi> a Juror? That moſt excellent, harmonions eutaxie
in Heaven which God himſelf ſettled from the beginning amongſt
the Angels, is a thing more perfect then that which we call Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
liberty on earth; yet even amongſt the Angels there are different
thrones and Preeminences, and though all oppreſſion be excluded,
all ſubordination is not. How Levelling therfore ſhould ſtand with
Liberty amongſt men, when it ſtands not with that more perfect
Order which is amongſt Angels, I canot ſee: and yet Levelling it ſelf
is far more tolerable, then that extreme Ataxie which our Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
ſeek to introduce under that more plauſible name. But you
bring Authorities for what you ſay, concerning the Juriſdiction of
your 12. Men, and cite <hi>Litleton</hi> and <hi>Cooke</hi> for that purpoſe. All that
is affirmed by <hi>Litleton,</hi> and <hi>Cooke</hi> is this, that in ſome Caſes the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
may render a verdict at large upon the whole matter: that
they may have cognizance of the condition of a Leaſe, where they
have cognizance of the Leaſe it ſelf: that a ſpeciall verdict may be
given in any Action, whether the iſſue be ſpeciall, or generall: that
where the Inqueſt may give a verdict at large, if they will take upon
them the knowledge of the Law, they may give their verdict gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.
In the application of theſe Authorities, you ruſh haſtily upon
three groſſe errors. For firſt you ſtrain theſe your Atthorities to all
caſes and queſtions of Law, whether eaſie or uneaſie whatſoever, and
this cannot be done without manifeſt violence to the words of your
Authors. 2ly. You ſtrain theſe Athorities to all Jurors whatſoever,
whether they have knowledge of the Law, or not: and yet the
words themſelves cry out againſt ſuch a torture. For both <hi>Litleton</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:117320:14"/>
and <hi>Cook</hi> are expreſſe in this, that the Jurors muſt be ſuch, as take
upon them the knowledge of the Law. Now we know well that ſome
Caſes are ſo plain in Law, that the meaneſt men may underſtand
them: and that Jurors at ſometimes have been ſo choſen, that they
might well take upon them the knowledge of the Law in matters of
greater difficulty. But he that ſhall conclude from hence, that all
Jurors in all caſes underſtand Law, or that their verdicts ought to
ſway, though they underſtand not Law, ſhall ſhew himſelf ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ridiculous. For we all know, that of common Tradeſmen, and
Husbandmen, ſuch as ordinarily uſe to be impannell'd, there is not
one of a thouſand that underſtands Law in a point of any intricacy:
and we know as well that ſcarce any thing in the world could be
more miſchievous in a State, then to leave differences, and Suits in
Law to Judges utterly ignorant, and unlearned. I make no doubt, but
if our Levellers could obtrude this impoſture upon the world, and
procure any favourable reception for it, it would advance their
cauſe much, and exceedingly haſten that generall confuſion and
diſorder, which they aime at, I know nothing more conducing to
their ends. 3ly, You ſtrain the word Verdict here beyond <hi>Litleton</hi>
or <hi>Cook,</hi> for they only ſay they may give their judgement upon the
whole matter; but you infer, therfore the Judges are meer ciphers,
therfore the Judges have no right or power to deliver their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
therfore the determination of the Judges is no way forcible,
or obliging. This is a <hi>Non ſequitur.</hi> For though the Verdict be given
in upon the whole matter, and ſo incloſe Law as well as Fact, yet
the binding Force of the Verdict, as to matter of Law, may be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the ſanction, and ratification of the Judges, not from the
juriſdiction of the Inqueſt. And it may well be ſuppoſed, that the
Jurors may erre in matter of Law, in which caſe the Judges muſt
alter the erronious verdict by a contrary judgement; and that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
queſtionleſſe ſhall nullifie the erronious verdict, not the erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
verdict the judgement. Whereby it plainly appears, that in a
verdict upon the whole matter there is no new juriſdiction acquired
by the Jurors in matter of Law, nor loſt to the Judges, foraſmuch
as the Judgement ſtands good, and obliges not as it is rendered by
the Jurors, but as it is confirmed by the Judges.</p>
            <p>But in caſe all your Forces ſhould be routed, you have yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place of ſtrength to retreit to; you ſay, <hi>Mens non Actus facit reum;</hi>
if the books be found yours, if the matter of the books be found
treaſonable, yet you having never had any treaſonable intention
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117320:14"/>
in thoſe books, ought to be judged according to your guiltleſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
not according to your guilty books. This rule of yours can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denyed to hold in caſes where the intention is as manifect as
the Act; but in other dubious caſes, where the Delinquent hath no
evidence for his guiltleſſe intention, beſides his own averment,
Judges, and Juries obſerve it not. God therfore before whoſe all-piercing
eye nothing is obſcure, to whom the inward intention is as
viſible as the outward act, judges of the Act by the intention: but in
humane Courts it is otherwiſe, for man cannot judge the ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
but by the overt act; and ſo where any doubt is of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
he leaves that, and ſafely paſſes his judgement upon the
act, which proof has put out of all doubt. And therefore by Gods
own Law, in caſes of Chance-medly, where one neighbour unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
and unwillingly had ſlain another by the fall of an ax, &amp;c. the
caſuall delinquent was abſolutely free before Gods unerring Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
above, but not ſo before his earthly, deceivable Judges here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
for if he made not haſte to exile himſelf from his own habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
he remained obnoxious to the ſword of the Marſhal. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the innocency of the minde did no further abſolve in contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
tranſgreſſions, where no teſtimony but the act it ſelf came in
againſt the tranſgreſſor: you have little reaſon to expect abſolution
in ſuch ſtudied, premeditated crimes as you are arraigned for,
when no teſtimony of innocency but your own comes in for you.
I have now done with all your more plauſible, and ſpecious juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
and if I have proved moſt of them to be ungatory, ſinew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
cavilations, having only the ſhadow of reaſon, but nothing of
the ſubſtance in them, blame me not for handling them under both
Notions. I come now to your ſcurrilous, opprobious, unchriſtian
language, wherein the deteſtable eructations of your mouth (being
but the envenomed, imbitter'd ejections of your proud heart) have
violated Heaven, as well as earth, conſparcated Laws, as well as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
and denigrated the actions of our Forefathers, as well as
ours of modern times. A man would think, that the abyſſe of Hell it
ſelf had been ranſackt, and rummaged for the making up of ſome
railings, that iſſue almoſt daily from your mouth, and of ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
paſſages that flow almoſt weekly from your pen: howſoever
I will not ſay as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Magus,</hi> you are in the gall of bitternes,
I will only ſay (as I may ſafely) the gall of bitterneſſe is in you. He
that was the Recorder of your ſtory, as if you had been too ſhort in
your incivilities, has made his Margin a ſupplement to help out
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117320:15"/>
what was wanting, and therefore to confute Mr. <hi>Nutleys</hi> teſtimony
againſt you, He addes, This as an arrant lie. pag: 81. and to confute
Judge <hi>Nicolls,</hi> He adds, What a lying Judge is this Mr. <hi>Nicolls?</hi> p. 34.
alſo to caſt an odium upon our Laws, He cals our Terme Judges the
intolerable bondage of <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> and all proceedings in Law
there, <hi>Outlandiſh, the meer introductions of the Norman Tyrant.</hi> p. 20. But
you were not the penman, you onely approved of this ſtory thus
being penned, and ſet your hand as a Licenſe for its publication.
You ſay well, you need not to be loaded with more then what you
muſt needs avow to be your own. Some that were abſent, as the Lo:
Preſident, p. 12. ſome that were dead, as the King: p. 36. did not
eſcape your laſhes: nay the whole Army, p. 145. though not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at all in this buſines, eſcaped not without this brand from you,
that they had twice rebelled againſt their Creators, Lords and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
But I haſten to thoſe that were preſent in Court, or that were
intereſſents in the Courts proceedings. The Atturny Generall,
though a Member of the Parliament, and a ſervitor to the State in
place, and truſt very eminent, is more then ten times abuſively treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by you. You ask him, p. 143. <hi>What baſeneſſe is this in you to uſe me
thus falſly.</hi> p. 114. you ſay He uſed you, as the Scribes and Phariſees
did our Saviour: p. 60. You call him <hi>Your Proſequutor,</hi> and that in an
extreme foule, and diſhoneſt way. Upon divers occaſions you tax
him of notorious, groſſe, impudent untruths. See p: 145. 142. 141.
99. 52. 17. &amp;c. The L: Commiſſioner <hi>Keeble,</hi> told you no priſoner had
ever ſuch favour as you; to which you anſwered immediately, that
to diſprove what He ſaid, you could ſhew an hundred precidents to
the contrary. p. 49. the Margin has this tante alſo: <hi>Take notice the
Judge ſtood up, and ſpake out an appeal to the people.</hi> Moreover, p. 121.
when He told you the Commiſſioners could not bear any further
delays from you, you return'd preſently, <hi>Will you not give me breath? if
you thirſt after my blood, and nothing elſe will ſatisfie you, take it preſently.</hi>
your unreverence to the whole Bench is incredible, ſometimes you
ſingle out the Judges, as the principall members, and ſometimes you
diſcharge your rancour againſt the whole aray of your Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners.
P: 34. You ſay tis the unjuſteſt thing in the world, that you for
your life ſhould have to do with all the Judges (who are all engaged
men) that have had above ſix months time, with the aſſiſtance of
divers Parliament-men your enemies, to beat their brains together
againſt you. P: 35. O Lord, was there ever ſuch a pack of unjuſt and
unrighteous Judges in the world. My life is before you, you may
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:117320:15"/>
take my blood if you pleaſe. P: 40. You make the Judges greater Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans
then the King, and pray God to deliver you again, and again
from all ſuch Juſticiaries. P: 44. I am willing to die the object of your
indignation, and malice. P: 46. Contrary to your ſolemne promiſe
you make my ignorance in the formalities of Law, to be the means
of my deſtruction: you divers times call them faith-breakers, cruell,
bloody men, <hi>Norman</hi> intruders; and wiſh your innocent blood may
be charged upon them, nay and upon their poſterity for divers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
You frequently tax them of ſurprizing, circumventing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring,
murthering you with nicities, and puntilioes. I could cite
more then 20. more paſſages to this purpoſe. As for the whole Court,
you handle them alſo no leſſe ruggedly. P: 146. you oppreſſe me firſt,
and then go about to hang me as a Traitor, for crying out of your
oppreſſion: the Lord deliver me, and every honeſt man from you the
vileſt of men. P. 148. There was never ſuch a Triall upon Engliſh
ground as this, where all the legall rights of an Eng: have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
P: 31. All the proceedings hitherto have been ſo abſolutely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary,
that twas impoſſible for me to come provided. P: 64. You
make your Proteſt againſt their unjuſt and bloody proceedings, and
in other places you ſometimes appeal from them to the Jury, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to your Auditors, ſometimes to all mankinde, ſometimes to
God. Many quotations might be to this effect. Next after the Court,
your ſpightfull, exulcerated minde breaks forth extreamly againſt
the Parliament, the ſupreme Power of <hi>England.</hi> P. 146. you ſay you
were impriſoned moſt unjuſtly by their Power, without any the leaſt
ſhadow, or colour in Law many months before their Acts were made.
P. 117. Tis very hard for me to conteſt with the preſent Power,
whoſe Agents have free liberty to ſay any thing againſt me, whileſt
I am denyed all the priviledges of an Engliſhman. P. 86. when the
Parliaments Act of Treaſon was preſſed againſt you, you ſay, as
there may be counterfeit money, ſo there may be Statutes too, and
for ought you know this may be one too; and then you deſire proof
that theſe are true Acts of Parliament. P. 79. you except againſt the
teſtimony of Coll: <hi>Purefoy,</hi> becauſe a Parliament-man, and ſo a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
againſt you. P. 47. <hi>Impriſonment, and many provocations were long ſince
put upon me, to make me cry out of oppreſſion; but to hang me therfore by a Law
made after the pretended crime, is not juſt.</hi> P. 34. <hi>You and the Parliament ſet
us long ſince together by the ears with the Caveleers, to fight pretendedly
againſt their injuſtice.</hi> P. 31. <hi>I have been impriſoned ſeven months for nothing.</hi>
P. 14. <hi>All my enemies baſe, wicked Petitions, Papers, and books preferred
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:117320:16"/>
againſt me were hugged, and embraced by the Parliament: but my friends,</hi> p.
13. <hi>could get no Anſwer to their Petitions, but received ſlights, abuſes, and
ſcorns.</hi> P. 11. <hi>Contrary to the Petition of Right, and other wholſome Laws
(though there hath been eight yeers wars in England, pretendedly for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Law, and Liberty) was I by force of Arms apprehended, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
againſt.</hi> Thus raſh, and harſh you are againſt this preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
and yet not onely againſt this preſent Parliament, for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Parliaments alſo, as often as they ſide not with you, finde you
the ſame man. <hi>Ex: gratia</hi> all the Parliaments that ſettled, or eſtabliſht
Terme Judges, and Commiſſions of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> you charge
of bringing in upon us intollerable burthens, and irrationall inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.
And thus in taking upon you a cenſorian, and Pretorian
Power over all Laws and Law-makers, you raiſe your ſelf above all
that is called God upon earth; and in ſo raiſing your ſelf, you affect
a tyranny over us not ſo truly unchriſtian, as Antichriſtian. Give me
leave now hereupon freely to expoſtulate with you, and lay aſide all
partialitie. 1. Why will you, being a private perſon, riſe up ſo fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt the government of a State, when you ſee you muſt either
periſh in the deſigne, or compaſſe the ſame with ſo vaſt an effuſion
of other mens blood? By Gods Law, every ſoul is to be ſubject to the
higher Powers, and whoſoever refuſes to ſtand to the finall ſentence
of the higheſt Power, is puniſhable by death. Upon this account the
Magiſtrate is owned by God, as his anointed Vicegerent; and the
good King of <hi>Judah</hi> giving a charge to his Judges before they went
forth to execute his ſpeciall Commiſſion of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
preſſes them to integrity, becauſe they were to judge for God,
and not man. Our Law directs you alſo to be tryed by God and
your Countrey, but you except againſt that direction purpoſely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you conceive God is not in the Court preſent to paſſe upon
you, but has onely an ordinary preſence there, ſuch as he has every
where. But if the judgement-ſeat be Gods, and not mans, and if
the ſentence which the Judges ſpeak upon that ſeat be Gods, and not
mans, (as we muſt needs beleeve it is, if we will beleeve the expreſſe
words of Gods book) how can you deny God to have an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
judiciall preſence in the Court? a preſence to try and paſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you? for this is moſt plain, if God were not judicially, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily
in the Court, the Judges then ſhould be ſaid to determine
for man, and not for God, to give ſentence in their own names, and
not as Gods miniſters. You will anſwer, that the men in preſent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
now at <hi>Westminster,</hi> which granted this Commiſſion are U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117320:16"/>
and we are not to look upon Uſurpers, or imagine that they
ſo repreſent God, and do Gods buſineſſe, as other legall Magiſtrates
that are rightly inveſted by God himſelf. Hereunto I ſhall reply,
that judgement in this caſe (whether the preſent Parliament be
rightly the Supreme Authority of <hi>England,</hi> or no) belongs not to
you being a private perſon, more then it does to me, or any other
man in <hi>England.</hi> You know alſo, that when ſuch judgement belongs
not to one private perſon more then to another, and the judgements
of all private perſons are ſo apparently divided, as now they are,
that no one can decide without indangering the peace of all; that
private perſon can never diſcharge himſelf of ſedition, and Treaſon,
which breaks the common Peace out of a fond preference of his
own phancie before other mens. In <hi>England</hi> there are now ſome that
hold the Supreme Authority to be in the laſt Kings Heir abſolutely,
and their endeavours are to bring him in upon his own terms; you
and your party, hold it lawfull to joyn with him, upon your terms,
but till you joyn with him, and He ſubmit to your terms, the ſupreme
Authority is not in him: We, and our ſide, which is now prevalent,
after a long diſpute in Arms, hold this to be a true Parliament, and
that the true Parliament is ever the Supreme Authority of <hi>England;</hi>
and we have not onely the deciſion of the Sword (which in ſuch like
dubious caſes after the laſt appeal hath been made to it, is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
plea) but alſo the ſtrongeſt reaſon, and majority of ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of all the people throughout the Land on our ſide. Tis your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
regret that your party, and the Royaliſts, though they corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond,
and conſpire together, cannot both counterpoize the third
greater, and better party, that ſtands for the Majeſtie of Parliaments.
You, and the Royaliſts, have divers times endeavoured to perſwade
the people, that they are generally againſt the Parliament, and by
ſeverall acts, and attempts againſt the Parliament, you have put it
to the triall, whether the people would adhere to you, or the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
yet ſtill the major and better part of the people have declared
againſt you, and continued their loyalty to the Parliament. The
City of <hi>London,</hi> if it had been ſo adverſe to the Parliament (as was
preſumed by you, and the Royaliſts both) was ſtrong enough to
maſter the Army, (the onely advantage of the Parliaments you
cry out upon) yet when it came to proof, would not draw a ſword
againſt the Parliament: if theſe demonſtrations will not ſatisfie you,
but you will ſtill plot new commotions, and ſtudy to ingage the
people in new bloody broils, you ſhew yourſelves to be thirſty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117320:17"/>
blood, and all your endleſſe cavilling pretenſions will not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
you before God. <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> the Prieſt of the royall line, and a
publick perſon, affords us an excellent example; his part was to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
a manifeſt Uſurpres, and Idolatreſſe, and to reinthrone a true
Prince, of whoſe title there was not one man in the whole Nation
that could make any doubt, yet to avoid bloodſhed, and the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifs
of a dubious, open war, He divers yeers concealed the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Title, and ſubmitted to the yoke of a heatheniſh murderous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranneſſe,
making no inſurrection at all, till he was ſure to do right
to the young King, without cauſing any deſtruction of the people.
How unlike are your actions to <hi>Jehoiadahs,</hi> who being no publick
perſon, nor intereſſed extraordinarily in the preſent differences
above any other man, will needs hazard the peace of the Land
againſt a lawfull Authority, when you have little hopes of effecting
what you ſtrive for, without a vaſt expence of blood? But in the
next place, ſuppoſe the power of the Parliament were indubitably
uſurped, as you can never prove it, (for it is ſtill but the Nations
power, and what Nation ever uſurpt over it ſelf?) yet by what Law
of God, or man, is it lawfull for ſuch a common perſon as you are to
machinate againſt it? <hi>Herod</hi> had uſurped over the Jews, the Romanes
had uſurped over <hi>Herod, Caeſar</hi> had uſurped over the Romans, yet our
Saviour ſhews himſelf ſubmiſſive upon all occaſions to all theſe
Powers. When He is brought before <hi>Annas,</hi> he comports himſelf
humbly, and as becomes a priſoner when he is lead to <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and
preſented before the Jewiſh Counſell, he yeelds to be examined,
and makes there ſuch anſwers as He knew would be adjudged blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous,
and capitall. When he was turned over to the Tribunall
of <hi>Pilate</hi> the Romane Deputy, and tranſmitted from thence to <hi>Herod</hi>
the Deputy in Galilea, He ſtill made reverent dutifull confeſſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all legall Interrogatories, though to the eminent forfeiture of his
own life. Yet no man will ſuppoſe all theſe had a proper juriſdiction
over our Saviour, or ſuch power as was free from all force, and uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.
All the Apoſtles alſo walked in our Saviours ſteps, for we
read that they though innoent were examined, ſcourged, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and did ſuffer martyrdome by Magiſtrates in all Nations under
Heaven, and we read not that any one of them at any one time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverently
treated, or declined any Court, or Counſell, except it
were by appeal from the inferior to the ſuperior Judge: yet we may
ſafely beleeve that ſome of all the States, and Potentates before
whom they were convented, might be liable to this exception of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117320:17"/>
yours. You will ſay, all men in juſtice ought to be enemies to Uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and Friends to ſuch as are unduly depreſſed. I reply on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that private men, let the caſe be what it will, of their own
heads, or upon their own conducts, are not to riſe againſt a ſettled
Uſurper, or enterprize any thing that may diſturbe the common
Peace: nay even publick perſons are to prefer the ſafetie of the
people, before any lower intereſt, or right, or Law whatſoever. The
ſtory of <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> juſtifies this, during ſo many yeers as He ſuffered
<hi>Athaliah;</hi> and the ſtory of <hi>David</hi> alſo, who by right, and Law, was to
proceed againſt <hi>Joab</hi> for murther; but the ſuperior right, and Law
of Common ſafety bounds his hands many yeers from doing juſtice:
and yet we cannot ſay therein, that the not doing of juſtice was the
doing of injuſtice, inaſmuch as He obeyed the ſuperior Law rather
then the inferior, and choſe to ſpare one guilty murtherer, rather
then to expoſe thouſands of innocent men to the chance of war. But
in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>: place, if you will needs ſuppoſe you have a right to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
this Government uſurped, and ſo juſtly lyable to your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
yet why do you not then circumſcribe your ſelf within the
bounds of this Government? how is it, that you aſſume to your ſelf
as great a prerogative of cenſuring the acts of other Parliaments, as
you do of this, and the ordinances of our Anceſtors as imperiouſly
as you do ours? If you did ſeem wiſer in the Laws of <hi>England</hi> then
all the Judges, and Lawyers of the Land, you did arrogate too much
to your ſelf: but when you will pretend to be wiſer then the Laws
themſelves, when you will with opprobrious terms revile the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative
power of this Nation, and ſay, that for ſix hundred yeers
together our Anceſtors, aſſembled in Parliament, were the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
or continuers of fooliſh and ſlaviſh Acts; you arrogate more to
your ſelf, then any man till this day ever arrogated. In this you
challenge the obedience due to ſome great, new-rais'd Prophet, ſuch
as <hi>Mahomet</hi> pretended to be amongſt the brutiſh <hi>Arabians;</hi> or that
Vice-God at <hi>Rome,</hi> who amongſt a more dementated, obdurated ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
changes times, and cuſtomes at his pleaſure. In the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>: place
alſo if you will beleeve that you have a Dictatorian power over all
times, and Laws paſt, and preſent, and ſo may juſtifie all that you
act againſt them: yet why do you not act againſt them without ſuch
deteſtable curſings, odious raylings, and unſavoury deriſions, as
your mouth is perpetually defiled with? <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel
when He was in the liſts ingaged againſt Gods moſt rebellious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
broke not out into any diſtemper'd expreſſions, nor thought it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:117320:18"/>
beſeeming his holy cauſe to paſſe the bounds of juſt reproof. Tis
likely Satan which found no matter in <hi>Michael</hi> worthy of reproof,
was diverted by his malice into blaſphemous provocations; but
<hi>Michael</hi> notwithſtanding all the bitter provocations, and all that
matter of ſcandall, which abounded in his traytrous adverſarie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
himſelf from foule retortions. So our Saviour in the Goſpel
died praying for his murtherers, that they might obtain remiſſion,
even for that deſperately flagitious cruelty, which made the earth
tremble, and the Sun contract his beams. <hi>Stephen</hi> alſo the firſt diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of our Saviour that expoſed himſelf to Martyrdome, yet in the
very agonie of death recommended his ſanguinary perſecuters to
mercy. Wherfore if the Son of God, if Angels, if all the Apoſtles uſe
bleſſing inſtead of curſing, and if all holy men ſtill pray for their
moſt mercileſſe executioners, inſtead of rayling where guilt is never
ſo evident: what is it for you to imprecate heavie judgements upon
Gods Judges ſitting on his Bench to ſpeak his ſentence? and from
what kinde of ſpirit do your filthy upbraidings, and ſarcaſms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
when you powre them not onely upon Magiſtrates, but upon
righteous Magiſtrates, ſuch as offer you no wrong, but ſuffer much
at your hands? Certainly if theſe things proceed from a right Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſpirit, we muſt beleeve that the milde white Dove which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
upon our Saviour in the river of Jordan, has now changed
wings with the black, carnivorous raven. <hi>Paul</hi> once out of a ſudden
paſſion, and incogitancy call'd an high Prieſt <hi>painted wall</hi> (a term
not undue to the man, though ill applyed to the Ruler) but being
preſently returned to Himſelf, He recovered his wonted meek, and
patient temper; and though he had ſuffered a moſt unparralleld
peece of injuſtice from a wicked man, He was not aſhamed after to
retract, and check himſelf publickly for deriding a wicked Ruler.
Tell me then ſeriouſly, is this contumelious ſpirit that rages in you
the ſame that poſſeſſed Chriſt and his Diſciples? can you imagine,
that you who not onely defie Gods Miniſters of Juſtice, in the place
of Judicature, and ſpeak vilifyingly of the higheſt of Powers, but
alſo harden your ſelf therein, and trumpet it forth to the world, as
if you had atchieved thereby ſome glorious conqueſt, are of the
ſame ſpirit, as thoſe which went like ſheep to the ſlaughter, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
opened their mouthes before their ſhearers? St. <hi>Paul</hi> condemnes
in himſelf an unwitting, precipitated taunt againſt a Judge very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
and ſcandalous, but you think you may juſtly pride your ſelf
in blaſpheming many righteons Judges, and this you do at ſuch a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117320:18"/>
time, in ſuch a place, and before ſuch an Auditory, that your blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
muſt needs reach God mediately, though it ſtrike his anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vicegerents immediately. I can ſay no more but this, the ſame
thing which in your own practiſe makes you boaſt, makes me being
practiſed by another, tremble. Laſtly, if you muſt have a licenſe to
oppoſe Authority; to oppoſe all manner of Authority, ancient as
well as modern; and further, if you muſt be licenſed to joyn all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of reproaches, execrations and blaſphemies to your oppoſition:
yet what means this, that you ubraid other men moſt of that, which
you are moſt apparently guilty of your ſelf, and for the moſt part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe,
and columniate thoſe whom you take for enemies with ſuch
things, as all men know to be moſt apparently falſe? when you have
inſolently tyranniſde over our ancienteſt Laws, and Cuſtoms, and
the Powers from whence they were derived; when you have purſued
our high Court of Parliament with bitter exprobrations; when you
have entertained the whole Bench of your Judges with ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
as is onely due to the baſeſt, and worſt of men; when you
have obſtructed the proceedings againſt you with the moſt trifling
nicities, and ſcruples in Law that everwere invented; when you
have ſpent your ſtrength, and tired your lungs (as your ſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains)
not by pleading, but by ſeeking an exemption from plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and therfore have ſcarce allowed any freedom to the Court to
anſwer you; you nevertheleſſe complain, that all Law, and right has
been denied to you: that tis the ſworn deſigne of the Parliament to
compaſſe your life by indirect means: that your Judges have inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
over-awed you; that you have been inſnared with meer pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilios,
and formalities of Law; that freedome of pleading hath been
taken from you. Never was caſe more cleer in the world then yours
is: if there were no Court to judge your books ſeditious, nor no te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
to prove the books yours, yet I am perſwaded there is ſcarce
a man in <hi>England</hi> that doubts of either; That very Jury that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
you not guilty of compoſing thoſe books after proof by
witneſſes, I am moſt confident did in their hearts beleeve you unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably
the Author of them, before they heard any witneſſe ſpeak
at all. Violent preſumptions heretofore were held ever ſufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,
and as good as legall teſtimonies, and yet though all mens
conſciences in your caſe are ſatisfied with violent preſumptions, and
violent preſumptions are now ſeconded with competent, pregnant,
abundant teſtimonies, that you are the Author of theſe books: and
though you your ſelf think not fit to deny them, yet you are not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117320:19"/>
aſhamed to inveigh againſt them, that judge you to be the compoſer
of them. I cannot indeed imagine that thing of which you are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
if you are aſhamed of any thing, tis the abſolute deniall of
your books, for which you are Indicted; but I am perſwaded tis
ſome other reſpect, and not ſhame that makes you abſtain from that
deniall. You ſeem frontleſſe enough, when you cry out upon your
eaſie, contemned Judges for intrapping, and oppreſſing you: but
when you cry out upon their ſnares, and oppreſſions at the ſame
time that you call them ſhadows, and non-entityes, ubraid them as
<hi>Normane</hi> Intruders, denounce againſt them as willfull, perjured mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,
and in very deed make yourſelf a Judge at the Barre, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
them as your priſoners on the Bench; you ſeem more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
then Impudence it ſelf: your want of bluſhing is enough to
make not only Friends, but even ſtrangers, and oppoſites to bluſh
for you. But you that acknowledge no Law, unleſſe it be conſonant
to your own humour, and unleſſe it receive its obliging force from
your ſanction, how can you offend? and you that cannot offend, why
ſhould your face be ſtained with that ordinary tincture of modeſty
that abaſhes other men? Humane rules and precedents are all liable
to your condemnation: if you ſay they are irrationall, or ſavour of
innovation, thats ſufficient to over rule them: and as for Divine
Authorities, tis in your breaſt to interpret them, and no mans elſe,
whereupon they are made <hi>Lesbian</hi> rules to you, and they muſt not
conform, but muſt be conformed to your judgement. <hi>Ex: gra:</hi> The 4.
Evangeliſts teſtifie, that our Saviour being preſented in judgement
before divers Tribunals, made ſuch pleas, and confeſſions as drew
on upon himſelf a capitall ſentence, and were the only evidence, that
either the Jews had to condemne him of blaſphemy, or the Romans
of ſedition. You nevertheleſſe ſay, that our Saviour by ſilence avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the danger of his Examiners, and left you a warrant thereby to
conceal your guilt from the Judges, and to evade that danger of
condemnation which the preſcription of our Laws would elſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
you in. When the States Atturney Generall preſſes you for
an anſwer to his proofs, and not meer allegations, which make you
the Author of ſeditious books: you more then once aver, that our
Saviour ſhook off his Interrogators with an eluding anſwer; and
therefore in imitation of Chriſt you ſay, <hi>Thou M:</hi> Prideaux <hi>affirmeſt,
I am the Author of ſeditious books, but prove it if thou canſt.</hi> This is ruffe
handling of humane Magiſtrates, and Laws, but this is worſe hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Inſpired Writers, and worſt of all is the falſe gloſſe you ſet
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:117320:19"/>
upon our Saviours actions. Our Saviour being demanded by <hi>Caiphas</hi>
in the Counſell of the Jews, whether he were the Son of God, or no,
according to <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> returned anſwer, <hi>Thou ſaidſt it:</hi> and
<hi>Mark</hi> repeating the ſame Anſwer, makes it a pure affirmation, or an
aſſent confirming what the high Prieſt ſaid. For <hi>Marks</hi> relation
which muſt be the ſame as the other Evangeliſts was, anſwers poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
and fully to the queſtion: <hi>I am the Son of God.</hi> 2ly, All theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts
record this further of our Saviour, that immediately after
his anſwer to the high Prieſt, He proceeded to tell the Counſell, that
they themſelves ſhould one day ſee him ſitting on Gods right hand,
and ſo be convinced of that now they would not beleeve. 3ly, The
Counſell underſtood our Saviours Anſwer to be affirmative, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive,
for upon that Anſwer, according to all the Evangeliſts, He
was inſtantly condemned of blaſphemy from the confeſſion of his
own mouth. Neither did our Saviour, being examined before <hi>Pilate</hi>
concerning his regall intereſt, give an evading Anſwer: <hi>Pilates</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
was, <hi>Art thou a King?</hi> our Saviours anſwer was, <hi>Thou ſayeſt it:</hi>
but to ſhew that this Anſwer was a poſitive affirmation of the thing
queſtioned, our Saviour added immediately, <hi>To this end was I born, and
for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſſe unto the truth:</hi>
And we finde that <hi>Pilate</hi> doubted not of our Saviours meaning, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were affirmative, or eluſive. This is therefore an high viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Divine Authority, that you ſhould call thoſe Anſwers, and
pleas of our Saviour dilatory, and fallacious, which the Evangeliſt
makes to be ſo plain, and the Jewiſh, and Romane Magiſtrates both
entertained as ſo poſitive: and that you ſhould flatly ſay, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
patroniz'd obſtinate ſilence in all Delinquents, and therefore
would not reveal truth, when He ſaies directly of Himſelf, that He
was born, and ſent into this world to bear witneſſe to the truth.
4ly, How can you imagine, that our Saviours ſilence to ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet
queſtions, was any juſtification of your not pleading, when
our Saviour had not the ſame reaſons of ſilence, as you, and other
Delinquents have, and pretend for? For firſt, our Saviour was guilty
of nothing, which in juſtice could take away his life, or expoſe him
to any other the leaſt laſh of the Law. If you will beleeve the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Judge, before whom he was tryed, He was convinced, and
thrice labour'd to ſave him, knowing that the Jews of envie proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
againſt him; and being driven to waſh his hands of ſo foule,
and murtherous ſentence, argued with the Jews, that He had not
onely examined him himſelf, and found no capitall delinquencie
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117320:20"/>
in him; but had alſo ſent him to <hi>Herod,</hi> and by <hi>Herod</hi> He was alſo
ſent back acquitted: this makes our Saviours caſe very different
from yours. 2ly, Our Saviour knew his doom was unavoidable, and
ſo He could not make uſe of ſilence upon the ſame grounds as you
do. 3ly, Our Saviours ſilence was not obſtinate, againſt any clear
Law, as yours is. 4ly, It was not generall, or continuall: when he
was queſtioned either about his Divinity, or regallity (things que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable
in Law) He gave direct anſwers: and even when He was
queſtioned extravagantly about his Diſciples, or the nature of truth,
or his doctrine, after ſome ſpace of modeſt ſilence, He gave reaſons
of his ſilence; He told them they were reſolved before hand not to
believe him: and that he had alwayes taught openly, and not in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
ſo that the teſtimony of his auditors, and ſpectators, would be
more proper in matters of that nature, then his own. Hereupon <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
received ſatisfaction, as alſo <hi>Herod,</hi> though all their impertinent
queſtions were not preſently anſwered: and when <hi>Pilate</hi> waſhed his
hands before the people in token of his innocency, and pleaded ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
for his inlargement more then once, or twice: He told the
people plainly, that <hi>Herod</hi> to whom He had ſent him to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
had ſent him back again, being of his judgement, and finding
nothing worthy of death in him. Laſtly, if our Saviour had refuſed
to anſwer <hi>Caiaphas, Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> who had not due juriſdictions
over him, this affords no plea, nor patronage for your peremptory
ſilence: foraſmuch, as our Saviour was a King <hi>de jure,</hi> though He
would not take upon him the office of a King <hi>de facto:</hi> and it may be
beleeved, that in ſome acts of his He did tranſcend the capacity, and
condition of a meer private perſon: in which He is not imitable by
you. I ſhall infer therfore, that you, when you cite our Saviours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and practiſe to juſtifie your oppoſing Judges and Laws, and
to ſmother Treaſon, and fruſtrate judgement, contrary to that which
is aſſerted by all the Evangeliſts, you do blaſphemouſly, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
make God the countenancer of ſin, that you may make man
the apter to ſin againſt God.</p>
            <p>The 5th: and laſt matter of ſcandall in your book, is, your double
dealings with the Jury: for though your 12. men are moſt religiouſly
obliged to bring in a verdict without favour or fear, you neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
endeavour both wayes to force them from their religious obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
aſwell by terror, as by arts of embracery. On one ſide, you
are their brother Citizen, a great honourer doubtleſſe of your City
matriculation: ſome of them you know to be honeſt men, as you are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117320:20"/>
a profound metapoſcopiſt, there are lineaments of honeſty drawn in
their very faces, and the whole aray of them has this preferment
from you, that they were the only ſupreme diſpencers of juſtice in
<hi>England,</hi> and that the Judges that ſit aloft in ſcarlet robes, are but
Clerks to ſay Amen to their verdicts: and this you pronounce as a
more profound Juriſt. On the other ſide, leſt theſe gentle ſtroakings
ſhould not ſufficiently win upon them, you place ſome hundreds of
your Myrmidons behinde in ambuſcado, who are ready to break
forth with mighty hums, and acclamations, at the cloſing of your
defence, and before the Atturny Generall enters upon his reply. You
did conjecture doubtleſſe that your 12. Jurors (half of them being
congregated out of <hi>Chicklane, Pickt-hach,</hi> and the other Suburbs of
<hi>Smithfield,</hi> without one Butcher amongſt them all) would be apt to
ſhrink at ſuch a new, unexampled impreſſion. Former times would
have lookt ſtrangely upon ſuch attempts, and ſuch divers aſſaults
made upon a Jury: but in you all frauds, and riots are pious and
plauſible, ſo they may acheive to you a conqueſt over your oppoſites,
nay in all your ſurpriſals and oppreſſions of other men, you muſt
have leave to complain, that you are ſurprized, oppreſt, and cut off
from all right by a State of conſpirators.</p>
            <p>Sir, I could now let the rains of my diſcourſe looſer, and take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to range further, (for ſince the writing, and Printing of this
Letter, I have ſeen ſome other Additions, and ſupplements of yours,
or your Friends, about your Triall, and I may perhaps hereafter
animadvert upon them: But I will not at preſent purſue you too
far, I will rather chooſe to give my ſelf a ſudden ſtop.</p>
            <p>The Angels that fell from Heaven had nothing to ſeduce them
unto ſo deſperate a revolt beſides their own excellent Natures; there
was not in Heaven any other object that could tempt, or pervert
them. Had they dutifully, and piouſly limited their contemplations
to the tranſcendent bleſſedneſſe, and infinite perfection of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
they had not ſo fondly inamoured themſelves, upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
nor dazeled their own eyes with their own created beauty:
but when their eyes were once dazell'd with objects leſſe amiable,
their devotions were eaſily alienated from objects more amiable,
and that alienation in them was moſt ungracious, and damnable.
Neither did exceſſive, doting ſelf-love onely exile the Angels out of
Heaven, but alſo, men out of Paradiſe; for <hi>Adam</hi> likewiſe, judgeing
himſelf neereſt to himſelf, and ſo thereupon confining all his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or the ſupreme ſway of his affections to himſelf, erroneouſly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117320:21"/>
thought himſelf worthy of an equality with his Maker: and ſo not
laying to heart the greatneſſe, and goodneſſe of God, but blinding
himſelf with an undue zeal to his own perſon, he moſt unnaturally
made himſelf Gods rivall, as if he himſelf were capable of Divine
knowledge, or God deducible to humane imbecillty. Tis not worth
inquiry, whether <hi>Adams</hi> will firſt darkned his underſtanding, or his
underſtanding firſt captivated his will: we know <hi>Adam</hi> had the
principle of knowing, and the principle of affecting good in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
degree: and that He ſinned againſt both thoſe principles when
he valued a finite, derivative, obliged excellency in himſelf above
infinite, originall, obliging excellency in his God. For in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
and birth of ſins, it often happens, that at the ſame time the
underſtanding contracts darkneſſe from the factious vehemence of
the will: and the will contracts obſtinacy from obſcurity in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
And I think, we may ſafely beleeve that <hi>Adams</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
was too unactive, and remiſſe at the ſame inſtant, for that
it did not further improve, and feed the will by ſublime, reſtleſſe
contemplations: and at the ſame inſtant that his will (having al|
readie received ſo much light from the underſtanding) was too cold
and unaſpiring, for that it did not ſtill covet ſolid ſolace from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
more glorious, and to that end reſollicite eagerly the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
for profounder illuminations. Such was the origination,
and ſemination of ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; ſuch is ſtill the traduction and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of ſin in <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity: there is no difference but this:
we now are not guilty of our own ſins only which we daily commit
our ſelves, as we naturally pertake of <hi>Adams</hi> frailties, and are left
obnoxious to a thouſand new temptations thereby; but alſo of his
firſt tranſgreſſion, as we were morally ingaged in the ſame Covenant,
and ſo left obnoxious to the ſame puniſhment. We remain therefore
all far more apt now, then He was to adore our ſelves, and to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribe
our own blinde affections within the circle of our own
excellencies: and this is ſo eminent in ſome men, that ignorance no
ſooner begets arrogance in them, then arrogance begets impudence:
and impudence begets wilfulneſs, and an outragious hardneſs in
malice. Sir, if you who know your ſelf to be of <hi>Adams</hi> race, would
deal ſtrictly with your ſelf, and impartially inquire into the cauſe
that makes you ſo far to poſtpone all Powers, Laws, profeſſions of
men to your ſelf, and moſt immodeſtly to boaſt of thoſe things in
your ſelf, which you would diſdain in other men, and which other
men think as diſdainable in you: you would ſoon diſcover your
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117320:21"/>
ſelf-love had quite put out your eyes, and then betrayed you into
the ambuſcadoes of all thoſe daring ſins that uſe to fight under the
banners of violent inſolence, and of uncontrouled impudence. The
main canker that feſters inwardly, and infects your moſt retired
thoughts is this, that you ſee other men promoted in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
to places of honour, and power before you, whereas you in
worth, and value promote your ſelf far before them, nay, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whatſoever: and this groſſe error does not only ſwell you into
diſdain, and malice implacable againſt other men, but alſo inflames
you towards your ſelf with arrogance intolerable, and arms you
with immodeſty moſt unmalleable. You ought here to conſider, that
as to other men you are no competent Judge of their parts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments,
more then every other private man in <hi>England</hi> is: and
when you ſee ſo many other men in <hi>England</hi> give a contrary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to yours, you ought to ſuſpect your own judgement, rather
then to deſpiſe theirs. Tis well known who thoſe men are, that are
moſt obnoxious to your emulation: and let but their enemies judge,
let their moſt conjured foes give ſentence is this cauſe, whether
they deſerve your emulation, or no: and even they will contradict
you herein, and tell you that they fear, and admire what you deride,
and rail upon. Then as to your ſelf, whom you adore, and court as
the moſt exquiſite peice of mankinde, and upon that account cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
whole profeſſions, whole States, nay and whole Ages not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
with your phancie: you ought to conſider, that of all men,
you are the moſt uncompetent Judge in your own caſe. Omit thoſe
whom you repute now your diametricall enemies, though they are
the major, and better part of the Nation, and ask the Royaliſts,
(whom you look upon as your late adopted Friends) or any others
unconcerned, if you conceive there are any ſuch: ask them what
value they ſet upon you, and doubtleſſe they will be bold to tell
you, that you are an Incendiary and Innovator; as far ſhort of
<hi>Perkin Warbeck,</hi> as you are beyond <hi>Wat. Tyler.</hi> I know there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of your Adherents, that ſeek to foment theſe prodigious high
conceits in you: and they perhaps may amount to ſome ten, or
twenty thouſand heads in all: but if my intelligence fails not excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
the greateſt part of them conſiſts of women, boyes, Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,
and the moſt ſordid ſediment of our Plebeians, and onely
ſome few are Royaliſts, or turbulent Levellers, who rather make uſe
of your furie, the admire your policie; and imploy you as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
rather then follow you as a head. But if you think men
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117320:22"/>
whether Friends, Enemies, or Neuters, are apt to deceive, and as apt
to be deceived, and therefore unfit witneſſes, or Informers in this
caſe, fix your thoughts more ſtudiouſly upon things: conſider your
own wayes, and poſitions, as I have here more nakedly preſented
them to your view. You ſee your main endeavour is, to open a way,
and maintain, that any private, ſingle perſon may diſpute, nay
damne any Command, Law, Cuſtome, or Power whatſoever, and
lawfully frame parties to abet him in his diſturbance of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
peace by any means whatſoever: that the diffuſive, or rather
confuſive body of the people may be appeall'd unto, by malcontents
in any common cauſe, although it be ſo vaſt a body that it is ſcarce
to be congregated, or rightly ordered, or conſulted with in any one
place, or at any one time, when ſome one fundamentall point is to
be aſſented unto, or diſſented: and muchleſſe is it fit for the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
adminiſtration, and exerciſe of rule in ordinary caſes, as often
as private men ſhall finde themſelves aggrieved: that all ſtudy of
Law and Policy is miſchievous, and therefore the judgement of all
difficulties, and difference ought to be expected from unletter'd me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks,
Plebeians, not from ſuch as are nobly deſcended, ſuch
as have been verſt in State-buſineſſe all their dayes, and ſuch as
have made Law their ſtudy from their youth: that the Nation ought
not to have any one common place of reſort for juſtice, ſuch as <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Hall</hi>
is: but for the better cautonizing of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and diſſecting it into ſeverall independent (and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
repugnant) bodies, in each County there ought to be a ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Tribunal: in which Tribunall the ignoranter and meaner ſaeces
of the multitude ought to poſſeſſe the higheſt Chair: that popular
liberty ought to be inlarged beyond all rationall politicall bounds,
ſo that no private Subject ought to pay any tax for defraying the
publick charge, unleſſe it ſtand with his own liking: nor ought any
Fellon, or Traitor, be examined, or held to any form of triall, further
then it ſhall pleaſe his own humor. Theſe are the crude traditions
which your levelling ſect abides by: now let not onely thoſe which
have been bred under <hi>Eng:</hi> Laws, but let all other Nations that
imbrace the Romane Civill Juſtitutes imbodied by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> nay let
Heathens, Turks, Jews, let all men of former ages, as well as of this
preſent declare, if any thing can be invented more deſtructive to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and the congregative diſpoſition of mankinde, then theſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
are. No more need be ſaid, if you profeſſe the ſubverſion of
your Countrey, and a generall emnity to the kinde of man, your
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117320:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
philoſophy muſt be held impious, though not ſtolid: but if you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
theſe things for the good of your Countrey, and your kinde,
you will be held, as ſtolid, as impious: but what ſhall I ſay? in caſe
ſelf-love has wholly dementated you, all that I can preſſe will be to
no purpoſe, neither can the various teſtimonies of men, nor the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable
evidence that ſhines out of common <hi>maximes,</hi> nor the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of all ages convince you, that you are to credit any thing
beſides your ſelf. What your preſent temper is therefore, whether
flexible by counſell, or inflexible I cannot tell: but I muſt needs tell
you this: for a cloſe of all:</p>
            <p>Since you have acted your part ſo outragiouſly, it leaves an offence,
and a regret too upon me: that your Commiſſioners ſhould act ſo
tenderly: that the Jury ſhould act ſo diſloyally; and that <hi>London</hi>
ſhould be the Scene, where hands ſhould be clapt ſo unworthily.</p>

               <p>Sir, I had ſooner dreſt, and ſpeeded theſe my plain, freindly Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions,
had I been in <hi>England</hi> at your Arraignment, or if I had
ſooner recovered my health after my coming into <hi>England:</hi> therfore
let not delay, and the interpoſition of ſo many moneths expoſe me
to your miſ-interpretation. I had alſo kept theſe Papers from the
Preſſe, had you onely been concerned in them: but when my ſecond
thoughts ſuggeſted to me, that I was bound not to reprove you
alone, but your abettors, and partakers alſo, and that the charity
of my reproof ought not onely to extend to the conviction of you,
and yours, but alſo to the confirmation of all your diſſenters, I was
induced to make them publick: wherefore pray, let this apologize
for me in that behalf. <hi>Adiu.</hi>
