            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO' I do not at all know who are the <hi>Authors</hi> of the <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional Papers,</hi> yet I think so well both of the <hi>Performance,</hi> and of the <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Seasonableness</hi> of the <hi>Design,</hi> as to be highly pleased to find 'em so acceptable to you. Since I sent you the last, which was <hi>Numb.</hi> VIII, there is come out a small Pamphlet called <hi>Remarks</hi> upon it <hi>in a Letter to the Author.</hi> Which I here send you, not for any thing considerable, that I see in it, but to gratifie your Curiosity.</p>
            <p>There are a few things in it which I think sit to take a little notice of: And the first is his blaming the Author of that <hi>Paper</hi> for charging the <hi>Vindicator of the deprived Bishops</hi> a little <hi>severely</hi> on the account of his Notions and Practice. The <hi>Remarker</hi> tells ye, that what <hi>the Vindicator has said and writ in defence of the Rights of the Clergy, might, one would have thought, have secur'd him from the Pen of a Clergy-man. The Temper of the Laity in this Age and Nation is such, that few of 'em appear very forward to defend even the just Privileges of the Clergy; and therefore when a Lay-man will write on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, they ought to be so true to their own Interests, as at least to stand Neuters the mean while.</hi> If the Learned <hi>Vindicator</hi> has writ any thing in defence of the <hi>Rights</hi> of the Church, and the <hi>Just</hi> Privileges of the Clergy, we own our selves much obliged to him. But the Question is, what are their <hi>Rights,</hi> and what their <hi>Iust</hi> Privileges? Did I see one of the best of my Friends endeavour to <hi>Rob</hi> another on my account, I am a <hi>Knove</hi> if I stand <hi>Neuter</hi>; and a greater if I side with him to deprive another of what is rightfully his. I am oblig'd in <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> to take his part, whom my Friend would <hi>Wrong,</hi> tho' it were for my own Profit. It is no less honourable in a <hi>Clergy-man,</hi> and no less his Duty, to vindicate the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Laity,</hi> when others would invade them, than it is in a <hi>Lay-man</hi> to vindicate the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> in opposition to Secular <hi>Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> And as it his Duty in the Point of <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Honesty</hi>; so it is also in the Point of <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Prudence.</hi> For to <hi>grasp</hi> at more than one can well hold, what is that but the ready way to lose what one has?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49469:3"/>I must here observe how little the Clergy are oblig'd to Mr. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> for promoting this as one of their <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Iust Privileges,</hi> That for the sake of a Depriv'd <hi>Bishop,</hi> they ought to bring a Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Church, go a begging themselves, and ruine their whole Families. This is one of Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s very great <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and the chief of all those which with so much <hi>Kindness</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> he endeavours to lay upon us. If it be one of the <hi>Rights</hi> of the Church, that a <hi>Bishop</hi> ought not on any account to be Depriv'd by the <hi>Secular Power</hi> (which I take to be utterly untrue) Mr <hi>D.</hi> were he truly our Friend, would allow us also this Privilege, That when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a <hi>Bishop</hi> is once so Depriv'd, and we cannot avoid it, we may peaceably submit to his Successor, to secure <hi>our selves</hi> from that Ruin, which must otherwise fall upon us, and the <hi>Church</hi> from such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion, as would probably dissolve the whole Frame. If he is not pleased to grant, and to defend, this <hi>Right</hi> of the Church and <hi>Iust Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege</hi> of the Clergy, I must freely profess my Opinion of his Services: We have very little reason to thank him.</p>
            <p>One notable piece of Service which the Learned Mr. <hi>D.</hi> has <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously</hi> done both the Clergy and the Church, I cannot here in Justice pass by; and that his bestowing so <hi>sublime</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> a Character upon our first <hi>Reformers</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> particularly upon Arch Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> to that Book<note n="*" rend="inter">The <hi>Preface</hi> was not seized, but was published by it self under the Title of <hi>The Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England <hi>concerning the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the Clergy on the Lay-power.</hi>
               </note> which was sometimes since seized and suppressed by the Government. A sort of Service, which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Enemies of our Church and Reformation will thank him heartily for. Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sanders</hi> will hereafter have the honour to stand both together as Witnesses against the <hi>Reformers</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I desire it may be Recorded, and forever Remembred, That as one was an open Enemy, so the other, when he wrote those black Declamations, was no Member of our Church, but was actually engag'd in a <hi>Schism</hi> against it.</p>
            <p>What Thanks or Respect can that Man deserve from the Church, who, professing himself one of its Members, does not study to maintain the Peace of it, but only to advance his own Notions; and prefers his <hi>Fondling</hi> Opinions to its Welfare and Tranquillity; and endeavours to fix a black Character on its worthy <hi>Reformers</hi> and <hi>Martyrs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The mention I made of a Book of Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s, which was seiz'd and suppress'd by the Government, brings me to consider another <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49469:3"/>
of the <hi>Remarks,</hi> which wants a short <hi>Comment,</hi> and ought to be set in a True Light. <hi>I don't at all doubt</hi> (says the <hi>Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker) but that the Government had good Reasons to seize and suppress the Pamphlet you mention. There were possibly some things in it, which the Person by whose order it was suppressed, did not think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient should be expos'd to Publick view. But yet since there was a Promise from one engag'd in the Controversie, That he would secure whatever should be printed in that kind; and since after it was seiz'd, and before it was suppress'd, there were offers made of striking out whatever was offensive, and printing those Sheets over again, it seems something hard it should after all be condemn'd to the Lining Trunks and Paper Boxes.</hi> I confess I should scarce have understood this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, if it had not been explained by another Book of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> call'd, <hi>Historical Collections concerning Church Affairs</hi>; In the Preface of which there are these Words: <hi>Why may we not suspect that these Papers will be seiz'd, as well as the Learned Vindicators Answer was t'other day, though Dr.</hi> Hody <hi>had dared him to make a Reply, and promis'd him the Liberty of the Press, in an unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Letter which he sent him about</hi> August <hi>last, and it was the only stroke in it, which savoured of Decency and goods Manners: I am apt to think that so great a Rudeness has not been offer'd to so Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Man before: And if the Dr. does not make amends to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, by finding some ways that the Sheets may be restored, or by publickly declaring that it is not in his power to have it done, he must, his best Friends being Iudges, leave it in a very low and forlorn condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis (you see) on Dr. <hi>Hody</hi> that this Charge chiefly falls; and this is that which determin'd me to trouble you with these Reflections. I shall give you, Sir, a full account of this matter, as I have had it from several, who are intimately acquainted with the Dr. and to whom he has frequently related it with the most serious and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Protestations. In their Conversation in the <hi>University,</hi> when Mr. <hi>D.</hi> excus'd his not Answering the <hi>Case of Sees Vacant,</hi> upon pretence that it was difficult to print, the Dr. told him, that if he would take care to leave out all manner of Reflections, which might offend the Government, he himself would assist him to the utmost of his power in the publishing of it: This he still pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests he would readily have done: And he thought at that time that it lay in his power to obtain a <hi>Connivance</hi> for it. Two years and half after <hi>The Case of Sees vacant</hi> was published,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49469:4"/>
there came out a Pamphlet, Entitl'd, <hi>Discourses upon Dr.</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net <hi>and Dr.</hi> Tillotson, in which Dr. <hi>Hody</hi> is <hi>earnestly desired to reserve his</hi> Vindication of the Authority of the Civil Power in depriving a Bishop, <hi>no longer, that the most Learned and Pious Vindicator of the depriv'd Bishops, who had long expected it, might return an Answer both to that and the Case of Sees Vacant.</hi> 'Twas a great surprize to the Dr. to find after so long a time such a Reason as that given for Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi>'s not Answering his Book, remembring very well that in all the Conversation, which he had formerly had with him, he never pretended that Reason, but the difficulty of Printing; and having often told him, that he did not design to publish his <hi>Second Book,</hi> till he saw some Answer to the <hi>First.</hi> This was the occasion of his writing that <hi>unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi> Letter to Mr. <hi>D.</hi> which the Collector speaks of, the design of which he wholly mistakes. He blam'd Mr. <hi>D.</hi> for pretending such a Reason, and that he might not pretend to it any longer, he gave him a fresh Assurance, that till he had seen some Answer to his <hi>First</hi> Book, he was resolved not to publish his <hi>Second.</hi> About half a Year after this, upon the Discovery of the intended <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassination</hi> and <hi>Invasion,</hi> there being a search made for <hi>Conspirators,</hi> and <hi>Declarations,</hi> and the like, the <hi>Sheets</hi> of Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi>'s Book, fell accidentally into the <hi>Messengers</hi> hands. So far were the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours either of the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> from ordering them to be seized, or the Dr. from contriving or desiring it, that neither one nor the other knew any thing at all of their being in the Press: Tho' Mr. <hi>D.</hi> has been pleas'd to report that it was by the Dr's means and procurement that his Book was seized. Three days after the seizure of it, the Dr. receiv'd a Letter from an unknown Person, and without a Name, concerning it; and this was the first notice he had that there was any such in the World. He was desired in the Letter to make use of his Interest to have the <hi>Sheets</hi> restored; and immediately he applied himself to such in whose power he thought it might be to obtain a Retrieve for them. But the Answer was, That it could not be done, because the Book was written <hi>against an Act of Parliament</hi>; And to restore it, when once seiz'd, would be in effect to <hi>License</hi> it. After he had procured a <hi>Copy,</hi> and had perus'd it, tho' he met with certain Strictures, that discovered some <hi>Rancour</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and prov'd the Writer to be a little too much under the power of <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Spite</hi>;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49469:4"/>
yet they made no Impression; and a second time he signified his desire to have the Sheets remitted. But the Reason being such, his desire could not be granted: Which he took all occasions to let the <hi>Party</hi> know, by acquainting many with it. This, Sir, is a true and full account of the matter. And by this time you are able to judge, which of the two has acted generously and Fairly, Dr. <hi>Hody</hi> in endeavouring to Retrieve his <hi>Adversaries</hi> Book, or Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> in wrongfully accusing him. I cannot but here tell you, that I have had my self a sight of this Book of Mr. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi>: And upon the perusal of it, I assure you, I think it very much for that worthy Gentlemans Reputation, that his Book was so seiz'd and not permitted to come abroad. You fancy now, that there was something very considerable in it; had you seen it, you would have been convinced, that the Learned Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is in this Dispute very far from being a formidable Adversary, and far from giving a just Answer to the Dr's Treatise: I hope they will be pleas'd to Reprint it, if they cannot at last Retrieve it. I am sure this is what the Dr. himself heartily wishes.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Learned Mr. <hi>D.</hi> that, of all the Men of this Age, has lain under the <hi>Misfortune</hi> of writing a whole Book, and <hi>mistaking the Question</hi>: As it plainly appears he did when he wrote his <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> against the <hi>Barocian</hi> M.S. Though in his <hi>suppressed</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise he a little mends the Mutter, yet even in that too he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently falls back into the very same Error. How unhappy he is in his <hi>Reasoning,</hi> is more than enough evident from that strange and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing lustance, which the Dr. takes notice of in pag. 14. of <hi>The Case of Sees Vacant</hi>; He pretends to justifie the present <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> from our being <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and yet makes us <hi>Hereticks</hi> for this very Reason, because they separate from us. A more <hi>Illogical</hi> and <hi>Unweighed</hi> thing never dropt from the Pen of any Learned Writer! You do not at all doubt but that in his <hi>suppressed</hi> Treatise, he offers at some Excuse, or at least confesses his <hi>Frailty.</hi> No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No such matter. He takes no notice of it, but wisely passes that by, as he does other things of the same kind. You do not at all doubt but that he has endeavoured to defend himself in those several Points of History, for which the Dr. has impleaded him (as, if he had thought fit but to step a <hi>fost</hi> or two out of his way, he might have shewn him to be guilty of a great many Errors more:) No such thing as that neither, I assure you. All these he passes by as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49469:5"/>
indefensible, without taking the least notice of them. All this I could have forgiven him, had I found in his Book any Answer to that which makes up the main part of the Dr's Treatise, <hi>The History of the Churches behaviour</hi> in such a Case as ours is. No, this too he perfectly gives up, and does not so much as pretend to answer it. Instead of all this, he is wholly taken up in disputing against a part of the <hi>Doctors</hi> first Chapter, and in laying down certain Conjectures, <hi>videtur</hi> upon <hi>videtur,</hi> (as you know his Way is) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Abiath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi>; which signifie nothing.</p>
            <p>I would not be thought, from what I have said, to Insult and Triumph over that worthy Persons Failings and Infirmities. He that wisely and impartially looks down into Himself, will rather desire to Triumph over his own, than over other Mens <hi>Frailties.</hi> But I could not but take notice of these Omissions in Mr. <hi>Dodwels</hi> Reply, which render it so extreamly defective and insufficient.</p>
            <p>I do not intend to weary you with a Confutation of what he has been pleased to say in that Treatise. Wrangling, you know, is infinite, and you cannot but be sufficiently acquainted with the Learned Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s particular way of <hi>Thinking</hi> and <hi>Reasoning.</hi> 'Tis the unhappiness of some Mens <hi>Notions,</hi> that they are <hi>founded</hi> wholly on <hi>Guesses</hi> and <hi>Conjectures.</hi> They resemble a <hi>Pyramid inverted:</hi> When first you look upon them, they appear perhaps pretty great, but the more you look down towards the <hi>Foundation,</hi> the less and less they appear, till at last they end in a <hi>Point,</hi> which is next to <hi>Nothing,</hi> and is <hi>Something</hi> only in the <hi>Fancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall only take notice, that whereas the Dr. had urged, that to avoid so great an <hi>Evil</hi> as that of a <hi>Persecution,</hi> it is reasonable to submit to the present Possessor; in Answer to this Mr. <hi>D.</hi> denies a <hi>Persecution</hi> to be an <hi>Evil.</hi> If it be not, why then do they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain? But a little after <hi>Nature</hi> returns, and there he is pleased to <hi>contradict</hi> himself: <hi>That our late Common Body</hi> (says he) <hi>is now divided, that his late Brethren upon Principles of Conscience are now</hi> persecuted; <hi>if he could not otherwise believe, he would feel if he had the compassion of a living Member; if he had the Zeal of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, when he used that passionate Expression,</hi> Who is offended and I burn not? <hi>If he had any sense of the afflictions of</hi> Joseph.</p>
            <p>In a word, since I have perus'd his Answer, I must needs say, I have been more satisfied, even than I was before, of the reasonableness of submitting in all such Cases of necessity. And it must be confess'd that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49469:5"/>
the great insufficiency of the Answer of so learned a Man, adds much to the Credit of <hi>The Case of Sees Vacant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it happend, as I was writing those words, there was sent me Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s Book just now Reprinted, with this Title, <hi>A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Vindication of the Depriv'd Bishops</hi>; which is word for word the same with that which I have hitherto spoken of. I am glad, Sir, to find my wishes so soon and so happily answered. You will now be satisfied (for I have sent it here together with these Papers) that what I have said of it is true. You your self will see, what little reason the Dr had (if he were not of a Spirit far above such an Action) to endeavour to have it suppress'd.</p>
            <p>And here for some time we will leave Mr <hi>D.</hi> and return to the <hi>Remarker.</hi> He tells ye, that <hi>as for the Learned Dr.</hi> Hody'<hi>s share in this Controversie, it is certain he has said nothing in his long Book, which the most impartial and judicious of his own side can judge to be capable in any tolerable measure either to satisfie the doubtful, or convince those that are of the contrary opinion.</hi> Who those <hi>most impartial and judicious</hi> Gentlemen of the Dr's own side may be, the <hi>Remarker</hi> best knows. These are <hi>Words of Course,</hi> and they signifie only thus much, That <hi>he has nothing to say.</hi> How well the <hi>Case of Sees Vacant</hi> has been receiv'd by the <hi>most impartial, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious,</hi> and the <hi>greatest Men</hi> of his side, his Adversaries know but too well for their own ease and satisfaction. I shall here for the great honour of <hi>The Case of Sees Vacant,</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> of it, produce you the Words of one of the most <hi>raging</hi> and envious of his Adversaries the Author of a Pamphlet Entitled, <hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Second Canon.</hi> Instead of lessening the Reputation of the <hi>Treatise</hi> and its <hi>Author,</hi> he has even against his will added much to their Credit. <hi>I had here concluded</hi> (says he) <hi>but as I was penning these few Considerations, News was brought me that after so long consulting and caballing, Stillingfleet-Hody was come abroad, laying about him like</hi> Goliah, <hi>knocking down no less than</hi> 6 <hi>or</hi> 7 <hi>at once, and making bolder Challenges than ever did that mighty Philistine.</hi> After a great deal of <hi>foaming</hi> Rudeness, with which he gives vent to his Gall and Envy, (such as the Dr is used to meet with from his <hi>Mild</hi> and <hi>Well-bred</hi> Adversaries, and which always falls back upon themselves) having laid down the Dr's Proposition and Opinion, he adds: <hi>Now this, tho' in other Words, is the main Principle which the Author of</hi> The Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of the new Separation, <hi>founds his Discourse upon, by which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49469:6"/>
any Man may guess at the Genius that runs through the whole Book.</hi> Again, <hi>I should wrong these few Considerations if I should further wander after a Treatise, in the contriving of which more Persons have been concern'd, than Mr.</hi> Hody'<hi>s Name hath Letters,</hi> &amp;c. What can be said more for the Dr's Honour and Reputation, than that his Adversaries cannot believe, but that his Book was compos'd by a <hi>long consulting and cabassing</hi> of the greatest Men of his side, and chiefly by one, who is by all acknowledg'd to have no Superior? <hi>Stillingfleet-Hody?</hi> I do not at all wonder, if the Dr has some inward <hi>Exultations</hi> upon so <hi>vast</hi> a commendation of his Book. Had the Title of <hi>Stillingfleet-M</hi>— been bestowed upon <hi>Me</hi> by my Adversaries on the account of any Book which I had written, I should have had, I believe, within me a certain <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> which, without a supernatural Assistance, would have <hi>mounted</hi> very near to something of a Fault. I am apt to believe the Dr will as long as he lives esteem this <hi>Nick-Name,</hi> as one of the most honourable Titles that ever can be given him, next to that of a <hi>Christian.</hi> I am sure I should, were I in his Case.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Remarker</hi> goes on, concerning the second part of the Dr's Treatise: <hi>What shall we say to the Matters of Fact, those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Things, as my Lord of</hi> Sarum <hi>is pleas'd to call them, that do not admit of Sophistry? What shall we admire most? The Doctors great Skill and Reading in Ecclesiastical History, or his wonderful Iudgment in producing so many Examples, some from the most degenerate times of Christianity, to prove only this, That in all Ages since the Empire became Christian, and the Profession of our Holy Religion was not only safe but honourable, there have been found some Men, who possibly to get or keep Preferment, have been guilty of unwarrantable Compliances.</hi> Can those many and <hi>Illustrious</hi> Examples, which the Dr. has produced in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, be look'd upon by any Man of Sense and Probity, to be nothing but the Examples of <hi>some Men, who to get or keep Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment have been guilty of unwarrantable Compliances?</hi> The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which the Dr. produces, are not of <hi>some Men,</hi> but of <hi>Churches, general Councils,</hi> and the <hi>whole Catholick Church</hi>; not of one Age only, but of several Ages, in several Cases, and in extraordinary provoking Circumstances: Not of Men that <hi>to get or keep their Preferments would be guilty of unwarrantable Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,</hi> but of Men, who in other Cases most stoutly oppos'd their Emperors, and were ready to sacrifice all they had in the World
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49469:6"/>
to the honour of Religion. No; it is for Mr. <hi>Dodwel,</hi> and the Men of the <hi>Remarkers</hi> Party, to produce only <hi>some few Men</hi>: What sort of Men, they know: <hi>some Men,</hi> who through <hi>Crossness</hi> and <hi>ill Humour</hi> do not care tho' they <hi>rend</hi> the Church, and disturb'd the Peace of it: 'Twill be worth our while to look a little on those Examples, which the Dr. has produced, and see who these <hi>some Men</hi> were, who <hi>to get or keep their Preferments were guilty of such ill Compliances</hi>: Lest you should not have the Dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Book by you, I shall take so much pains, as to draw out these <hi>ill Men</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. The sight, I dare say, tho' it makes our Adversaries so apt to <hi>fall</hi> into <hi>Fits,</hi> will in you raise the highest <hi>Respect</hi> and <hi>Veneration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He begins with <hi>Abiathar,</hi> the first High-Priest that appears to have been depos'd by the <hi>Lay-power</hi>; and observes, that after he was depriv'd by King <hi>Solomon, Zadok,</hi> who was put into his place, was received as the true High-Priest by the Jewish Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his Services accepted of God. Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi>'s Evasion, that <hi>Abiathar</hi> was not the <hi>Supream</hi> High-Priest, but <hi>Zadock</hi>; is sufficiently confuted by the Scripture it self, which tells us, that <hi>Abiathar</hi> being depriv'd, <hi>Zadock</hi> was <hi>Anointed</hi> in his stead: Not to mention other things.</p>
            <p>He has shewn, that in after Ages, when the <hi>High-priests</hi> were <hi>commonly</hi> depos'd by the bare Authority of the <hi>Secular Power,</hi> their Successors were readily acknowledged as true High-Priests, and that too, tho' in other Cases the Jews were at the same time most zealous Defenders of their <hi>Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He has shewn that our Saviour himself, and his Apostles acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd and communicated with those, who succeeded such as were depos'd by the <hi>Secular</hi> Governours, as true High-priests. This our Saviour would never have done, if he had design'd that his Followers in after Ages should not do the same in Relation to their <hi>Bishops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had he shewn but only thus much; he had sufficiently vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the present Practice of our Church. But his History does not end here; He has also shewn, that the same was the Practice of the Church of Christ in all Ages, whensoever a Bishop, that was put into the place of another depos'd by the <hi>Civil</hi> Power, was <hi>known</hi> to be <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and otherwise <hi>unexceptionable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He has shewn that <hi>P. Felix</hi> II. the first <hi>Orthodox</hi> Bishop that succeeded another depriv'd by the <hi>Secular Power,</hi> was receiv'd and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49469:7"/>
own'd by all the whole Church who <hi>accounted</hi> him <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and is honoured to this day as a <hi>Saint</hi>; tho' <hi>Liberius</hi> his Predecessor, was not only depriv'd by the <hi>Secular</hi> Power, but by a <hi>Heretick,</hi> and for <hi>defending</hi> the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Faith.</p>
            <p>He observes, that when <hi>Lucius</hi> was made Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the room of <hi>Peter,</hi> whom the <hi>Heretical</hi> Emperor <hi>Valens</hi> had depriv'd; the Reason why he was rejected by the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Party, was only because he was an <hi>Arian,</hi> not because he succeeded ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom the <hi>Emperor</hi> had violently depos'd. <hi>The People having been nourished</hi> (says <hi>Theodoret</hi>) <hi>with the Doctrine of</hi> Athanasius, <hi>when they saw that quite contrary Food was offered them, kept off from the Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He observes that <hi>Peter,</hi> the rejected Bishop, in the <hi>Epistle</hi> which he wrote to the <hi>Church-Catholick</hi> concerning his <hi>Deprivation,</hi> tho' he endeavours with a great deal of Rhetorick to set forth the Crimes of his Successor, and to excite in all the Church an Abhorrence of his Actions, yet he raises no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection against him on this account, because he was made Bishop in his place, whom the <hi>Emperor</hi> had violently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.</p>
            <p>Those Instances are of the 4th Age. He has shewn in the 5th, that S. <hi>Briccius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tours,</hi> being violently depos'd and driven away by his <hi>People,</hi> tho' he did not give up his Right, but endeavoured to be restored, yet <hi>Iustinian</hi> and <hi>Armentius,</hi> who were successively put into his <hi>Place,</hi> were own'd by the Church as true Bishops of that <hi>See,</hi> and there was not any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance in the Church on his account: That <hi>Gregory</hi> the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian, who himself was Archbishop of that See, and afterwards a <hi>Saint,</hi> acknowledges them as true Bishops, and ranks them in the List of the Bishops his Predecessors: That St. <hi>Briccius</hi> himself, though he look'd upon himself to be still the <hi>Rightful</hi> Bishop, yet he own'd them to be true Bishops; and he gives <hi>Armentius</hi> the Title of <hi>his Brother; the Bishop of</hi> Tours.</p>
            <p>He observes, that when <hi>Theodosius</hi> had got himself to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Patriarch of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Murder,</hi> in the room of <hi>Iu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enalis,</hi> who had never been at all depriv'd, the only Objection that the Great and Orthodox Abbot St. <hi>Euthimius,</hi> when urged to Communicate with him, was, That he had been guilty of many <hi>Murders</hi>; and was also a <hi>Heretick.</hi> His Answer was no more than this, <hi>God forbid that I should approve of his Murders and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49469:7"/>
evil Opinions.</hi> He observes withal, that those Bishops, that had been ordain'd by the Usurper <hi>Theodosius,</hi> were never theless acknowledged by the Church as true Bishops, and if their Predecessors were not still living, were contained in their Sees.</p>
            <p>He observes that <hi>Timotheus Aelurus</hi> being constituted <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the room of <hi>Salofaciolus,</hi> whom <hi>Basiliscus</hi> the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> and withal a <hi>Vsurper,</hi> had depos'd, was rejected by <hi>P. Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicius</hi> and <hi>Acacius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>C P.</hi> for this only Reason, because he was a <hi>Heretick</hi> and <hi>Parricide.</hi> When <hi>Simplicius</hi> had heard that <hi>Acacius</hi> had forbid <hi>Timotheus</hi> to enter into any of his Churches in the City of C P. he sent him his Thanks in these Words, without taking any Notice of <hi>Salofaciolus's</hi> Unjust and Uncanonical Deprivation, <hi>Thy constancy,</hi> says he, <hi>is praise worthy both in the sight of God, and in ours, in that thou wouldst not suffer that condemned Person to enter into any of the Churches of</hi> C P. <hi>not only because he was a Heretick, but only because he was a Parricide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He has shewn, that <hi>Iohannes Talaias,</hi> the Orthodox Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> being depos'd by the bare Authority of the Emperor <hi>Zeno,</hi> tho' after he was depos'd, he still laid claim to his Right, yet <hi>Mongus</hi> who was put in his place, was own'd as a true Bishop of that See by as many as accounted him no <hi>Heretick</hi>; particularly by <hi>Acacius,</hi> that great and brave Patriarch of <hi>C P.</hi> and his Successor <hi>Fravitas</hi>; as also by <hi>Martyrius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> with all the <hi>Eastern</hi> Bishops in general. That the Bishops of <hi>Dardania</hi> and <hi>Calendion</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in their Allegations against him, take no notice of his being put into the place of one so Depriv'd, but only that he was a <hi>Heretick.</hi> That <hi>Euphemius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>C P.</hi> and the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Party of <hi>Aegypt</hi> Communicated with him till they discovered him to be <hi>Heretical</hi>; then broke off from his Communion. That <hi>Simplicius</hi> himself, <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> having received a Letter from the Emperor <hi>Zeno,</hi> touching his design to depose <hi>Talaias,</hi> was well enough satisfied, and nothing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased him, till he found that one, whom he accounted a <hi>Heretick,</hi> was designed his Successor. That the same <hi>Simplicius</hi> writing after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Patriarch <hi>Acacius,</hi> concerning the Deprivation of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical</hi> Bishops, desires him to intercede with the <hi>Emperor,</hi> That <hi>either the rejected Orthodox Bishops might be restored, or at least new Orthodox Bishops created.</hi> Whether <hi>old ones</hi> or <hi>new ones</hi> was to him upon the matter indifferent, provided they were <hi>Orthodox.</hi> That <hi>P. Felix</hi> III, in his Synodical Epistles to the <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>Acacius,</hi> concerning <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>'s his Promotion, takes no notice at all of his being put into the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49469:8"/>
place of one whom the Imperial Authority had depos'd, but only complains of his <hi>Heresie.</hi> That the same <hi>P. Felix</hi> in another Epistle, in which he Excommunicates the Patriarch <hi>Acacius,</hi> gives this as the chief Reason for it, because he communicated with the <hi>Heretick Mongus.</hi> And tho' at the same time he charges him with other Crimes, yet he does not obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct it to him as a Crime, That he Communicated with one who was put into the place of another <hi>Unsynodically</hi> depriv'd. Lastly, That <hi>Talaias</hi> himself did not think it Unlawful for the People and Clergy of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to acknowledge another for their Patriarch, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he were a Professor of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Faith. He fled, says <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius,</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and raises there very great stirs, affirming, what? not that another could not be own'd in his stead, because he had not been <hi>Synodically</hi> depriv'd, but that <hi>it was for his defending the Council of</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>that he had been depos'd; and that he, that was put into his place, was an Enemy of that Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He observes, that <hi>Calendion</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd without any <hi>Synod</hi> by the same Emperor, they that refus'd to acknowledge <hi>Gnapheus,</hi> his Successor, pleaded nothing at all for their so doing but his <hi>Heresie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He shews that <hi>Macedonius</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>C P.</hi> being violently depos'd by the <hi>Heretical</hi> Emperor <hi>Anastasius,</hi> because he refused to condemn the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> his Succsseor <hi>Timotheus</hi> was by all, that did not reckon him a <hi>Heretick,</hi> acknowledg'd as a true Patriarch; as particularly by the two great B shops and <hi>Saints, Elias</hi> and <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vianus</hi> Patriarchs of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> tho' at the same time they declared <hi>Macedonius</hi> his Deprivation to be <hi>null</hi> and <hi>invalid,</hi> and could not be induced by any Threats of the Emperor to subscribe to it. That the Orthodox Party of <hi>C P.</hi> Communicated generally with him, and that he was acknowledged by the Orthodox <hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Palestine,</hi> no less than 10000 in number, tho' they too at the same time condemn'd what was done against <hi>Macedonius</hi> as invalid. That the great Abbot of <hi>Studium</hi> refused to be consecrated by him, whilst he thought him a <hi>Heretick,</hi> but assoon as he had an assurance that he was not so, without the least scruple concerning the <hi>Unjust</hi> and <hi>Unsy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical</hi> Deprivation of his Predecessor, he readily yielded to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated by him.</p>
            <p>He further observes, that <hi>Flavianus</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> being violently depos'd by the same <hi>Heretical</hi> Emperor, the only Reason assigned by the Orthodox Party, why they would not communicate with his Successor <hi>Severus,</hi> was his being an Enemy to the Orthodox Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49469:8"/>He likewise shews, that <hi>Elias</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> being depriv'd by the same Emperor, his Successor <hi>Iohn,</hi> because he prov'd to be an Asserter of the true Faith, was by all the Orthodox readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; by all the People of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> tho' they extreamly hated him, as looking upon him to be one of the chief Instruments in <hi>Elias</hi>'s Expulsion; by those two great <hi>Saints, Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Sabas,</hi> with the rest of the <hi>Monks</hi> and Inhabitants of <hi>Palestine</hi>; by <hi>Io. Cappadox</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>C P.</hi> with all the Bishops that were under him: That his Name was preserved in the <hi>Diptycks</hi> of the Church together with that of <hi>Elias,</hi> and that he was honoured as well as he, by that Church as a <hi>Saint</hi>: That <hi>Cyrillus</hi> of <hi>Scythopolis,</hi> speaking of him, says, <hi>he was adorned with a Divine Prudence</hi>; and that in the Acts of the Council <hi>Sub Mennâ,</hi> he is stiled more than once, <hi>Archbishop of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>of holy Memory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may see it there prov'd, that tho' St. <hi>Silverius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was so violently and unjustly depos'd by <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s General <hi>Belisarius,</hi> yet his Successor <hi>Vigilius</hi> was own'd as true Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> by the whole <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, particularly by the 5th <hi>general</hi> Council; and is reckon'd by all to this day as one of the true Popes.</p>
            <p>That tho' <hi>Macarius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was depos'd by the bare Authority of the Emperor <hi>Iustinian,</hi> yet his Successor <hi>Eustochius</hi> was own'd as a true Patriarch by the same 5th <hi>general</hi> Council, and the whole Church <hi>Catholick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That after that, when <hi>Eustochius</hi> himself was depos'd by the same Authority, <hi>Macarius</hi> being restor'd, was acknowledged again as a true Patriarch.</p>
            <p>He shews you, that tho' <hi>Eutychius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>C P.</hi> was so unjustly deposed by the Lay-power, and tho' he still laid claim to the <hi>See,</hi> yet his Successor <hi>Iohn,</hi> was received by all the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> particularly by the Clergy and People of that City, tho' at the same time they exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly lov'd <hi>Eutychius,</hi> and accounted him unjustly depriv'd: That <hi>Eustratius,</hi> who wrote the Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e of <hi>Eutychius,</hi> though he was a great Enemy to the Patriarch <hi>Iohn,</hi> and speaks very angrily of him, yet he no where reflects on any for owning him as a true Patriarch: That the Emperors <hi>Iustin</hi> and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> tho' they had a great Veneration for the rejected <hi>Eutychius,</hi> yet they did not think themselves obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him by deposing his Successor, but stayed till his Successor was dead, and then restored him: That <hi>Eutychius</hi> himself, tho' he never gave up his Right, but look'd upon himself as the <hi>rightful</hi> Patriarch, yet he did not break the Peace of the Church, but continued to Communicate with those that acknowledged his Successor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49469:9"/>He shews you likewise, that tho' St. <hi>Anastasius</hi> was depos'd from his See of <hi>Antioch</hi> by the Emperor <hi>Iustin,</hi> without any <hi>Synodical</hi> Procedure; and tho' he never gave up his Right, but always look'd upon himself as the <hi>Rightful</hi> Patriarch, yet this Successor <hi>Gregory</hi> was unanimously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the whole Church, by <hi>four</hi> of that Age, who are honour'd by the Church with the Veneration of <hi>Saints,</hi> St. <hi>Symeon Stylites,</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> St. <hi>Eulogius</hi> Patr. of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn Nestutes</hi> Patr. of <hi>C P.</hi> That St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> communicated fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ely with him, tho' he own'd at the same time that St. <hi>Anastasius</hi> was <hi>invalidly</hi> Depriv'd, and that he was still the <hi>Rightful</hi> Patriarch: that he gives <hi>Anastasius</hi> the Title of Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and yet at the same time own'd his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor <hi>Gregory</hi> to be a true Patriarch of the same See, and gives him the same Title, looking on the one as the <hi>Rightful</hi> Patriarch, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the other as the Patriarch in Possession. He sends a <hi>Synodical</hi> Epistle to 'em both together, with this Title, which is very remarkable; <hi>Gregorius Ioanni Episcopo C P no, Eulogio Alexandrino Gregorio Antiocheno, &amp; Anastasio Patriarchae Antiocheno à paribus.</hi> And this is likewise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable that the Patr. <hi>Anastasius</hi> is placed the last of all, and after <hi>Gregory,</hi> who stands in his proper place, because he was a Patriarch only <hi>de jure,</hi> and not <hi>in Possession.</hi> And here I shall transcribe those words, which Dr. <hi>Hody</hi> observes, of the Learned <hi>Annotator</hi> on <hi>P. Gregory's Epistles; Non satis hoc advertere videntur, qui ad summos juris apices de re qualibet decernentes, Schismatibus &amp; contentionibus viam parant zelo</hi> PRAECI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PITI NEC SATIS CAUTO.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi>'s History adds, that when St. <hi>Martin</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was violently Depos'd by the Emp. <hi>Constance</hi> because of his adherence to the Orthodox Faith, his Successor <hi>Eugenius</hi> was receiv'd by all as a true Pope. And tho' he was put into the place of one so Depos'd, and who never had given up his Right; yet he's honour'd by the Church as a Saint. A <hi>Saint</hi> is Depos'd, and a <hi>Saint</hi> accepts of his place. And so far was that holy Man St. <hi>Martin,</hi> from thinking it unlawful for his Clergy and People to submit to another Bishop, that when he heard that there was another constituted in his Room, he offer'd up to God his prayers both for <hi>Him</hi> and his People, that their hearts might be established in the <hi>Orthodox Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To these he adds many more Examples of the following Ages, to shew that this was <hi>universally</hi> the Practice of the Catholick Church. He shews how great and how worthy a Person the Patriarch <hi>Photius</hi> was, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s See, whom the Emp. <hi>Michael</hi> had unjustly Depos'd: And observes, that the <hi>Metropolitans</hi> of the Province of CP. tho' they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49469:9"/>
own'd that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was unjustly depriv'd, and had still a great honour for him, and desired he might be restor'd, yet because the Emperor would not suffer it to be done, they peaceably yielded to Necessity, and submitted to the present Possessor.</p>
            <p>Such as these are those <hi>Sacred</hi> Instances, with which Dr <hi>Hody</hi> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd us. He has also shewn us, that the same was the practice of the Antient Church whensoever any Bishop was unjustly Depriv'd by an <hi>Uncanonical</hi> or <hi>Heretical</hi> Synod, if their Sentence was enforced by an <hi>uncontroulable</hi> Authority of the <hi>Secular</hi> Power.</p>
            <p>By this time you see what those <hi>some Men</hi> are, who, <hi>to get or keep their Preferments were guilty of such Compliances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us hear now what is said by a very great <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> of our Church concerning this History of the <hi>Drs,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi>'s Vind. p. 52. 146, &amp;c.</note> and the Instances he has given. <q>Dr <hi>Hody</hi> says he, has fully ended the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he had begun, from the Practice of the Church; and that in so convincing a Manner, that matter of Fact seem'd not capable of a clearer proof. But the not answering his Book, is now excus'd upon this pretence, Because he had promised another <hi>Treatise, Of the Power of the Magistrate in such Cases</hi>; which he has not thought necessary to enter upon, till he sees what is said to his Book, in which he has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

'<hi>In another place, says the same great Man</hi>; We challenge them to shew us where ever a Schism was formed upon the Lay-Deprivation of a Bishop, even when the grounds that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on were visibly unjust, if the Faith of the Church was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be concerned in the Matter. — The Intruders into the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Priesthood</hi> under the <hi>Iewish</hi> Dispensation, and the many Instances in Church-History, that Dr. <hi>Hody</hi> has cleared beyond a possibility of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Matter of Fact, are so express and full on our side, that their avoiding to answer them, is plainly a giving up the Cause. Their leaving the general Argument from the constant and uninterrupted Practice of the Church, and betaking themselves to the Methods of <hi>Slander</hi> and <hi>Defamation,</hi> is such an evident indication of a bad Cause and of a worse Management, that it is not possible but that the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of indifferent Men will soon discern how weak their Reasons, and how strong their Passions are. They have in all their other Writings built
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49469:10"/>
too much on the Authority and Practice of the Church to be able with any <hi>shame</hi> to reject this Argument, and to say that they ought to be govern'd by <hi>Rules</hi> and not by <hi>Examples.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We must here take our leave of the <hi>Remarker,</hi> and return again to the Learned Mr. <hi>Dodwel.</hi> It is certain that these Words of the Bishop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> and the challenge he gives them to Answer Dr. <hi>Hody</hi>'s Book, was that which <hi>awakened</hi> him, and put him upon publishing those Papers which were casually seized, and are now Reprinted.</p>
            <p>It was necessary (they saw) that something should be published, that at least might be <hi>called</hi> an <hi>Answer</hi>: and they knew that that <hi>Name</hi> alone would do at least some good, since the greatest part of Men look no deeper than the <hi>Title.</hi> The <hi>challenge</hi> is to Answer the History; and yet not a word in Mr. <hi>Dodwel's Answer,</hi> concerning those Instances of the Practice of the Church, which the Dr. principally insists on. As I have already said, he does not so much as pretend to Answer it. And what is this avoiding to Answer it after such a challenge from so great a Man, but <hi>more plainly</hi> a giving up the Cause?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi>'s Talent is <hi>History</hi>; And if a Man of his Learning and Diligence, is forced to give up the Cause, as it plainly appears that he is, we know not from whom to expect it. As St. <hi>Austin</hi> says of St. <hi>Ierome, Quod Hieronymus nescivit, nullus mortalium unquam scivit</hi>: so say I of the worthy Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi>; What he cannot do in a matter of <hi>History,</hi> and after so long a time (it is now somewhat more than <hi>five Years</hi> since <hi>The Case of Sees Vacant</hi> was published) the rest of the <hi>Party,</hi> tho' they are some of them Men of great Abilities and Learning, will not think it a disparagement to themselves, if we conclude it cannot be done.</p>
            <p>I cannot but take notice that He is so far from undertaking to Answer the Dr's <hi>History,</hi> that he presumes to tell the World, that the Dr him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self does not look upon those Instances, which he has produced, to be of any considerable Authority; that the Dr. himself does not value 'em. What? The Dr himself not value the Instances which he has produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced! This must needs have been great News to him. Lest you should suspect I might possibly mistake Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi>'s meaning, I shall give you here his own words. <hi>The Dr.</hi> (says he) <hi>professes beforehand his own unwillingness to be concluded by such Instances as himself has produced, tho' they should appear to be against him. Why so, if there had been any reason that he should have been concluded by them. Why so, if he did not thereby own that the Reasons given by the Vindicator against the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49469:10"/>
Argumentativeness of such Facts</hi>
               <note n="†" rend="inter">The <hi>Vindication</hi> excepts against ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving of Bishops by the Lay-power, not against such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples as the Dr urges, which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a quiet sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. But Mr D. frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Questions.</note> 
               <hi>were solid and concluding. And how can he find in his heart to insist principally in his following Book on that very kind of Facts, which he has acknowledged so unsafe to be relied on in his Preface? He cannot pretend to argue</hi> ad Hominem, <hi>when the Vindicator had so expresly enter'd his Exceptions against that whole Argument. He cannot do it in his own Person, when he professes himself unwilling to stand by the Consequences of it. And how can he have the confidence to obtrude that upon us, which he does not believe himself?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ground (in the Name of God!) could he have for all this strange <hi>Talk?</hi> He cites in the Margent these words out of the Dr's Preface: <hi>Should our Adversaries be able to produce such an example (as I think they will never be able) 'twill advantage their Cause but little, especially if it be one of the later Ages, since it is not agreeable to the Practice of the Church in general.</hi> Is it really Mr <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s mistake, this? Or did he intend to impose upon his Reader? For my Life I cannot imagine how it was possible for a Man but of a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Capacity to be guilty of such a Mistake. For all those Examples of the Church's peaceable Submission to the present Possessor, in so many several Ages, which are prov'd in <hi>The Case of Sees Vacant,</hi> the Dr challenges Mr <hi>Dodwel</hi> and his whole Party (and again the same challenge we here give them, and desire they would take notice of it) <hi>to produce him any one single Instance from the time of</hi> Aaron, <hi>the first High-priest of the</hi> Jews, <hi>to this very day, of a High priest disown'd by the</hi> Jews, <hi>or a Bishop disown'd by the generality of the Catholick Church, for this Reason, Because put into the place of another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the Civil Authority.</hi> And then he adds those words which you have read. By which it is as clear as the Sun at high Noon, that his meaning was no other than this, That since the present Practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is warranted by the <hi>general</hi> Practice of the <hi>Church Catholick,</hi> our Adversaries cannot be justified or excus'd by any <hi>one</hi> Instance on their side, if they could produce one; especially if it were one of the later and more degenerate Ages. If the Dr does not look upon <hi>one</hi> Instance, and that too in the more degenerate times, to be conclusive against the <hi>general</hi> Practice of the Church, and in the purer and more Learned Ages; does he therefore not esteem the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Practice of the whole Church in <hi>general,</hi> to be <hi>Conclusive</hi>? To conclude this point, and to satisfie Mr. <hi>D.</hi> how willing the Dr. is to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49469:11"/>
be <hi>concluded</hi> by such a constant <hi>Vniformity</hi> of Practice in the Church, I have leave to tell him, That he prefers the Example of the Church, which is so clearly made out in his Book, to the <hi>Iudgment</hi> and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ten — tho' I <hi>have</hi> leave to tell him, yet I will not say how many <hi>Vindicators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Question</hi> betwixt Dr <hi>Hody</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> is this; Whether <hi>our</hi> Practice, or the Practice of the <hi>Party,</hi> be conformable to that of the Catholick Church in Ancient times. 'Tis expected that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> should either prove all the Instances which the Dr has produced to be <hi>false,</hi> or produce as <hi>many</hi> and as <hi>good</hi> on his own side. If he cannot do this, much more if he cannot produce so much as <hi>one</hi> on his own side, whatsoever he publishes with the Title of an <hi>Answer,</hi> will be nothing but a Publick <hi>Declaration,</hi> That they <hi>are not able</hi> to justifie themselves.</p>
            <p>Time was, as Mr <hi>D.</hi> well knows, when the Practice and Example of the Church was of greater Authority with him. When the <hi>Bishops</hi> were first depriv'd, and their Sees fill'd, all places that were honour'd with Mr <hi>Dodwel</hi>'s presence, as well publick as private, rung aloud of Examples. I have been often told by such as were at that time at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and did themselves the honour to be often in Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that till Dr <hi>Hody</hi> published his <hi>Baroccean</hi> Treatise, Mr <hi>Dodwel</hi> constantly appeal'd to the Example and Practice of the Church. It was this, as I am very well assur'd, that first put the Dr upon publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing that Treatise. As soon as that was done, then the usual Plea was quite alter'd. Mr <hi>D.</hi> who before was so full of his History and Examples, begins now not to esteem them. And <hi>The Case of Sees Vacant,</hi> when that was published, made him utterly out of love with them. He is now for <hi>Rules,</hi> not <hi>Examples</hi>: And he has good Reason for it; for <hi>Rules</hi> he makes of his own, but <hi>Examples</hi> he cannot.</p>
            <p>When <hi>The Case of Sees Vacant</hi> first came out, it was very well known, that Mr <hi>D.</hi> and his whole Party presently fell upon a nice Examination of it. I know my self a very intimate Friend of Mr <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels,</hi> who examined the <hi>Quotations</hi> of a <hi>Chapter</hi> or two for him. Who has freely acknowledged, That he could not find any thing but what was rightly cited, and fairly represented. Had the <hi>History</hi> been found <hi>wrong,</hi> the Examples and Precedents of the Church had been still looked upon by the Party as very good things: But their great fault is, They all make against them. The Case is plainly this; We are so much in love with our own Notions, that we will not value any thing, no not the Authority of the Catholick Church it self, in opposition to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49469:11"/>Of a piece with his other mistakes (so I chuse to call them, rather than <hi>disingenuitie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>) is that which he tells his Reader in several places in his last <hi>Treatise,</hi> that Dr <hi>Hody</hi> owns the <hi>Invalidity of all Lay-depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</hi> Tho' the Dr had expresly told him in his Preface, that he <hi>reserv'd the Vindication of the Authority of the Civil Power in such Cases for a particular Treatise. I grant at present</hi> (says the Dr) <hi>that all Lay deprivations are Invalid.</hi> The Learned Mr <hi>D.</hi> has (it seems) forgot the difference between <hi>dare</hi> and <hi>concedere.</hi> It was not the Dr's business in <hi>The Case of Sees Vacant,</hi> to concern himself with the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Civil Power.</hi> His only business in that Treatise was to assert the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of submitting to the present Possessor, whether the other were <hi>validly</hi> depriv'd or not, where the Power that depriv'd is <hi>irresistible,</hi> and the Possessor otherwise <hi>unexceptionable.</hi> It is easie to observe, how desirous Mr <hi>D.</hi> and the Men of his side are, to have <hi>another Cause call'd,</hi> and to shift off that weight thet lies so pressingly upon them. But to this the Dr keeps them. And I think he does very well to hold them fast where he has them. To what purpose should we, who were not concern'd in the Deprivation of the <hi>Bishops</hi> concern our selves so much about that Question, <hi>Whether it be lawful for the Civil Magistrate to deprive a Bishop or not?</hi> since whether that be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or not, this at least we know to be lawful, <hi>The acknowledging the present Possessor, if on all other accounts unexceptionable</hi> Whether it were the Doctrine of the Church that <hi>Bishops</hi> may be depriv'd by the <hi>Lay-power</hi> for <hi>Political</hi> Crimes, or not, we are not obliged to know. 'Tis enough for <hi>us</hi> that we know, that this at least was the Doctrine of the Church (and we know it from it's constant and uniform Practice throughout all Ages) That when once they are depriv'd (tho' never so unjustly) and we cannot avoid it; it is lawful for peace-sake to own the Possessor. Dr <hi>Hody</hi> may publish, if he please, his <hi>Vindication of the Authority of the Civil Power,</hi> for the sake and satisfaction of those, who concur'd in the Deprivation of the <hi>Bishops</hi>: But we of the lower <hi>Form,</hi> who were not at all concern'd in the matter, we want no such Treatise to justifie our Practice: Our Practice is sufficiently justified by what he has already written. I will read it, if it comes out, as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Speculation.</hi> If it can have any influence on <hi>my</hi> Practice, it will be only to <hi>vindicate</hi> those, by whom the Bishops were depriv'd, against the <hi>Ragingness</hi> of such as discharge their Choler in so liberal a manner against them; which always turns back on themselves.</p>
            <p>I ought not here to omit, that that Book, which I mentioned above, called, <hi>Historical Collections,</hi> &amp;c. was design'd as a <hi>part</hi> of an Answer to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49469:12"/>
               <hi>The Case of Sees Vacant.</hi> Its business is to shew, that the Catholicks of the <hi>fourth</hi> Age, who refused to Communicate with <hi>Felix</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was put into the place of <hi>Liberius,</hi> and with <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who were substituted in the place of St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and with <hi>Meletius</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Eustathius</hi>; did not refuse to acknowledge them on the account of <hi>Heresie,</hi> but because their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors had been Unjustly and <hi>Vncanonically</hi> thrust out. And how is this prov'd? Why, they tell us, that the Catholicks of that Age did not look upon the <hi>Eusebians</hi> as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but continued to Communicate with them till after the Deprivation of St <hi>Athanasius,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore when after that, they refused to Communicate with them, it must be upon the account of the <hi>Uncanonical Deprivations</hi> and <hi>Successions.</hi> I shall not wander after the <hi>foul-mouth'd</hi> and <hi>raving</hi> Collector in his long wild <hi>Maze</hi> of <hi>Impertinencies,</hi> but shall give a full Answer to the whole in half as many Words as he has trifled away Pages.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eusebians</hi> of that Age, who are commonly called <hi>Semi-arians,</hi> were by some of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> accounted more tollerable, by others downright <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> though they sometimes pretended to imbrace the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith. Sometimes the same <hi>Catholicks</hi> entertained a favourable Opinion of them; at other times, according as their <hi>Heresie</hi> shewed it self more visibly in their Practice, they declined their Communion. This was generally the case after the Persecution and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion of St <hi>Athanasius.</hi> 1. <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself calls the <hi>Eusebians,</hi> his Persecutors, every where,<note n="(a)" rend="inter">Apolog. p. 692.

Thus the good old <hi>Abbot</hi> lived lovingly and contentedly with his <hi>Successor</hi> to his death, and was very useful to the <hi>Monastery.</hi>

            <p>I have only a word or two more to add, and that is to put you in mind, that when-ever you meet with any thing that may be published as an Answer to <hi>The Case of Sees Vacant,</hi> the Dr desires you would be pleased to Read both together. If you think he is at leisure, or of an inclination, to Answer every little thing (and especially of their <hi>Vnderworkmen</hi>) that shall be published against him, you will find your self mistaken. The <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of History (if I may use that word) are so fully comprehended and <hi>solv'd</hi> in that <hi>Treatise,</hi> that you will not need or desire any Reply, if you compare and weigh one with the other. As for those, that are of such <hi>pliant</hi> Understandings, as to fancy that which they read last, to be always the best, or to think that every thing is an <hi>Answer,</hi> that is so called in the <hi>Title page</hi>; His Judgment is that they are not worth <hi>Instructing,</hi> much less <hi>gratifying.</hi> You ought not to forget what he tells you in his <hi>Preface,</hi> That <hi>he hates everlasting wrangle, and an Adversary that Cavils, and excepts against things not material (or refuses to answer the main points) he shall think de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves</hi> a Reply <hi>as little as one that Rails.</hi> He often reflects on those Words of that <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Man, his late Lord, A.B. <hi>Tillotson,</hi> and desires to regulate his Life and Studies according to them; (it were well if all others would do the same.) <q>
                  <hi>A good Man should not be very willing,</hi> when his Lord comes, <hi>to</hi> be found <hi>as it were</hi> beating his Fellow-servants; <hi>and all Controversie, as it is usually managed, is little better. A good Man would be loth to be taken out of the World reeking hot from a sharp</hi> Contention <hi>with a perverse Adversary, and not a little out of countenance to find himself in this temper, translated into the calm and peaceable Regions of the</hi> Blessed, <hi>where nothing but perfect</hi> Charity <hi>and</hi> Good will <hi>reign for ever.</hi>

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49469:16"/>He is not so ignorant of the nature of <hi>Humane Passions,</hi> as to hope that his Adversaries can, at this time of day, be convinced by any thing that may be written. For, as the <hi>Collector</hi> himself owns, <hi>Men once dipt in Schism are hardly ever after brought to their former Consistency and Integrity.</hi> 'Tis TIME only that can do this. And to that the Dr leaves them.</p>
