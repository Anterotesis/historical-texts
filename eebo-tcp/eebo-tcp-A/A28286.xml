         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the love which springs forth from everlasting bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels
of Divine Love, which onely is known in the pure nature

in the Adultery and Transgression of that life and love! E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Lord God Almighty bring you to his fear, faithful
and obedient to his Witness, that his voice you may hear in
you, which calls to you daily to return, that to his help you
may all come, even you who from it are departed, his help
you know not, who are running further and further from his
Witness, into the many pathes, imbracing the many things,
and offending in all; and so the one thing is lost which is onely
needful, in which you might be made to wear the garment
which is unchangeable, and to walk in the path which is pure
and equal, and know the eye to be opened again, which the
god of this World hath blinded; which eye as it is opened,
sees <hi>Jacob</hi> which inherits the blessing, and brings savoury
meat, such as the Father loves, even while <hi>Esau's</hi> Garment he
did wear, yet <hi>Jacob's</hi> voice was known. So now the voice hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
diligently to hear, which calls out of the earthly, out of
the changeable, out of the mortal, that to the Immortal Word
all may come, where the immortal birth is known, and the
Babe of glory seen and enjoyed, and man by him, and in him,
come to possess the power of God, by which power the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of death comes to be destroyed, and all which hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
man under it, and man by it brought to be free again,
in the pure life which is endless; And truly sadness often pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses
my heart when I behold the World in the alienation,
out from the power and pure life, driven from the presence
of the living God, into the earthly nature and carnal mind,
there labouring and seeking, professing, getting into Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowships,
and all acting in that which adulterates from
God, both Priest and people.</p>
            <p>Oh deaf people! For the Seed's sake, which is Christ, are
many made to cry aloud, and not to spare, but give up their
bodies, and suffer cruel whippings, stockings, all manner of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104508:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
scoffings, scornings, and despiteful usuage, imprisonments in
stinking holes until death, and for no other cause but because
that love which we our selves have been beloved of, hath laid
a necessity upon, and constrains many to hold forth the good
will of God to mankind, and to declare the everlasting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
(the Word of God) hid in the heart, and that (in every
conscience) may be manifested, that all men may know again
the kingdom of God in them, and that near them, and not
a far off from them, but hid in them, which leads into the
kingdom of God; and truly this I know to b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the breathings
of Eternal Love in man, which checks and reproves him in
secret, even for things which no eye sees, nor no ear hears,
nor no tongue reproves (which are visible;) but there is no sin
so secret, but that spirit (which searcheth the heart, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the reins) findeth it out, and will pursue by checking and
reproving all things that is done or acted in that nature where
the transgressor lives: And this is the free gift of the pure
God to man, that thereby man may come to know his call by
his reprovings, his pure gift; and though it be the first and
least manifestation of Divine Love in the creature, yet is it
distinct from the creature, not of him, though in him, pure
as God is pure, who is the giver of it, and as unchangeable as
he is.</p>
            <p>Therefore you who have been long wording of it, Oh that
there were an heart in you to answer to the Lords love, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to his Witness! the long-suffering of God, the slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the holy and just One, the piercing and wounding,
oppressing as a Cart with sheaves, the pure life &amp; love (which
is God) you are not come to know, who live in the pride, in
the vanity, in the pleasures, who answers not to the Witness,
and you that are not come hither, knows nothing, nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
the Call of the Lord, though you may profess it in
words.</p>
            <p>Now honestly consider, What testimony bear you to Christs
death? Are you dead with him? What, and your iniquity
alive? And you who are ministring forth to others, what te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
bear you to these things before mentioned? Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104508:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when you have been tryed by any of the Lords people,
either you run away, or cause the people shamefully to hale
away them that come in Christs Spirit to demand a reason of
the hope that is in you, which shews you are ashamed of your
testimony, and afraid to be tryed.</p>
            <p>But many there be (sons and daughters) who witness his
death and resurrection, who hold forth a true testimony of
Jesus to the World, whose Ministry stands in Christ (the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of God) and is come to try you; your Testimony, and
Ministry. Now be patient, and flie not, and do no more as
you have done, to betray the holy Seed Christ, and lose that
which should be able to make you stand in the day of trial;
truly my heart is grieved for you, to see how you involve
your selves and others into that which leads you, and layes
you under eternal Woes, and yet you are pleasing your selves
with a false hope, which clothes you with vails of darkness,
and a faith vvhich makes not perfect, and purifies none, but
hath its ground in that vvhich is exalted above purity, and
oppresseth him vvho is the pure unspotted life, the Rock of
Ages, vvhich the true Faith vvhich makes perfect, is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in; and this the just lives by; and all they vvho vvitness
this, are not afraid to be tried, nor are ashamed of their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie,
neither do they manifest such an impatient spirit to
turn their back, or run away, or be impatient or wrathful,
but can willinglie (in the true fear of God, vvith meekness
and love) be readie to give an answer to every one that ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and in the same spirit (and mind which was in Jesus) calls
to all you who are bringing forth your ovvn begettings, and
that vvhich the comprehender hath formed in your ovvn
minds, every one bringing forth that conception vvhich the
povvers of darkness forms; but they that lives in Gods pure
light, sees all this and you in the pit, carrying your graves
about with you, and your clothing is death; and sees all that
vvhich led you thither, and sees vvhat is doing in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
He that can receive it, let him.</p>
            <p>Now Christ Jesus the light of the World, is vvitnessed to
be the Word of God, in vvhom is life, and his life is the light
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104508:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of men: Therefore now all you vvho are busying your
minds, and carnallie reasoning what it should be, some cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it a natural light, others saying that it's not sufficient
to shew every sin; I say, Cease your quarrelling against that
which should lead you to the help of the Lord, <hi>John 14. John</hi>
knevv vvhat it vvas he did bear a true Testimonie, he said he
vvas not that light, but came to bear vvitness of that light,
and h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Testimonie is true. Many are now Witnesses of it
with him, (praised by the Lord) and he said, <hi>That the life of
Christ was the light of men;</hi> [mark] It is the life of Christ is the
light of men, and this is it that lighteth every man that comes
into the World, (according to the measure of life received)
and I bring in my Testimonie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (though one of the least who
witness life) according to the measure of life received, That
it is light, and doth enlighten, and gave light to me, in which
I saw all things that acted in me contrary to the life of Christ;
and being believed in, and obeyed, it hath led me out of the
Devils Kingdom, into Christ, and so to God the Father of
Spirits, and truly people, there is no other way to Christ, but
by owning that vvhich checks and reproves you in secret;
therefore I beseech you return to the light every one who are
quarrelling against it, living in the careless mind so long until
you say you know no such thing in you; that is a dreadful
state, near the Reprobate who knows not Christ in thee; for
they that knows not that which reproves or shews sin, knows
nothing of Gods gift, nor of his good will to man, and so
are walking in the beastly state, without bit or bridle; the
love of God cries Wo, Wrath, and Vengeance to such a one,
and that man hath shut himself out from the salvation of
God, and hath no way to come near it again, but by waiting
to feel God's reproof by his Witness; for man being given
over to the power of the Devil, and his Vessel being filled
with his spirit, can easily sin against Gods Witness, and with
his will and great delight, easily join himself to the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor,
against the light, the life of Christ, and willingly lye
down in Transgression, and in this state the God whom he
serves (which is the Prince of the Air) will furnish him with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104508:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a hope which must perish, and give him a faith which may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
his tongue to talk of, but will never make him perfect
as pertaining to the conscience. And here lies all the World,
(who are found in the wickedness) out of Gods Wisdom,
out of his Fear, and found in the iniquity, in the alienation
from God, denying the light, and transgressing the life, out
from the help of the Lord, not answering his call, but giving
up themselves to the Devil, and answering to him and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up all that they have, and are, to him, both in their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and in their daily practise; and now being run far from
God, that call cannot be heard, nor that voice which calls to
him to return; yet something there is which lets men in this
state know, and convinces them that they are sinners, and
lets them see that they are weak, and have no power to do
well, (though they know not what it is) because the beastly
nature hath covered them with gross darkness.</p>
            <p>And though God hath made his dwelling-place in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that so he might come near to manifest his love to man;
yet man being shut up in unbelief, cannot believe that he is
so near him, or that this is he who visits him every day, and
afflicts him every moment; and this is Gods visitation in man,
which pursues man with reproofs, Gods good will to the
creature. Now all who slights this, hardens their hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the reproof of the Lord, and are found despisers of
his counsel, and will none of his reproof; therefore he that
made them, will not save them; he that formed them, will
shew them no favour; when ye call, he will not answer; and
when ye cry, he will not hear nor help; and so all your cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that spirit, doth but tempt the Lord to pour down
vengeance and wrath upon you: Yet doth the good will of
God to man follow him with reproofs again, and herein he
manifests his long suffering and forbearance, though he be
pressed as a Cart with sheaves, yet still his good will ceaseth
not, and his mercy and love waiteth to be gracious; and all
this he doth that man might return, or be left without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse;
for a sufficiency there is in Gods gift to let man see what
is good, and what is evil; therefore fear and tremble you wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton

ones, who are walking at ease in iniquity, dreadful will
your sentence be, when he shall swear in his Wrath you shall
not enter into his rest; and that be pronounced, <hi>My spirit shall
no longer strive with man.</hi> Therefore now consider while you
have time, and know that that spirit shall strive for its time,
and bear its testimony in you against all the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
for though the Devil be strongly seated in mans heart,
yet the weakness of God is stronger then that; for though
that that checks is the least manifestation of God in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the lowest and weakest that can be in appearance,
yet is it so strong that all the powers of sin and the Devil
cannot hinder it from bearing it's testimony, until it hath
left the creature without excuse; and you who are not found
faithful to improve the one Talent, are not found worthy to
receive any more. And so let the Lord be clear of the blood
of all men, and whether you receive this, or no, yet a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
hath he begotten to himself, who will bear witness to
his gift, and sing <hi>Halelujah</hi> for evermore.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A word unto you Rulers, Justices of
Peace, Constables, and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</head>
               <p>IN the fear of the Lord you are warned by one who stands
a true Witness to the Lord amongst the generation which
the living God hath raised up in his power to bear witness to
his perfect Gift which is now to be held forth to Kindreds,
Tongues, and Nations, by a despised people to be lifted up,
that so he might draw man unto him; even this is he who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the generation of them that are saved, is become
Lord over all; even he who is the light of the World, who
must be lifted up among the Nations, that so healing every
one may witness who comes to him, looks upon him, believes
in him, power they may receive to become the sons of God;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104508:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore be ye warned (who are before-mentioned) how you
seek by your Power or Authority to hinder the Testimony by
suppressing the Meetings of the Lords People, his Sons and
Daughters, who are made in Christs spirit to declare to all
people how they come to witness Christ Jesus the Saviour, (as
near to deliver, as the Devil is to tempt and destroy) glad
tydings to the thirsty, weary soul, and a possibility to all men;
The blood of souls shall cry vengeance upon that in all men
which seeketh to suppress this our Testimony And you Priests
who preath for money, and prepare war if you have it not,
the blood of the innocent ones who have dyed in stinking
holes and dungeons, (thrown in there by you because they
could not deny Gods Witness in them, to pay you your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney)
that blood cryeth loud, <hi>Vengeance, Vengeance:</hi> And also
that blood which hath been shed by cruel whippings for no
other thing but declaring Christ the light in all men, with
the blood of souls which cryes loud in the ears of the Lord,
who will render vengeance in the day when he makes inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for blood upon you who are found in such practises.</p>
