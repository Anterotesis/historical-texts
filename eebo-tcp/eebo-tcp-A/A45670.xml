            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The People expect a Confeſſion always at the time of any Mans Execution: Therefore at that hour when it ſhall pleaſe God to call me to it, that I may have nothing more to do than to recommend my Body and Soul to him that gave it, I have writ this, which has a little taken my thoughts from my Duty to God, for which I emplore his Pardon.</head>
            <head type="sub">I beg of the Reader to make no Nice Conſtruction of my words, but to take the real honeſt meaning.</head>
            <head type="sub">I have writ this merely, and only for the ſatisfaction of my Relations, Friends and Acquaintance. I have not had time to digeſt it into Method, becauſe Time is precious with me now.</head>
            <p>IN the firſt place I will give an Account of my firſt Acquaintance with that Gentlewoman Mrs. <hi>Vauwick,</hi> for whom the World believes I committed this bloody inhumane Murther, and for which I now ſuffer.</p>
            <p>About two years ago I was brought acquainted with her, being a Widdow, by a Gentlewoman of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and had not been above 2 or 3 times in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, till I was Arreſted for 40 l. at that time I having got a Commiſſion for Cornet in my Lord <hi>Danbies</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereupon my Friend came to ſee me in Priſon, and with her this Gentlewoman: I told them I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65954:3"/>
for I had but juſt got my Commiſſion, and if my Lord ſhould hear of it, I ſhould loſe it; and my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would never do any thing for me, who were able to furniſh me with ſuch a Sum as was fitting for that Poſt. Whereupon this Gentlewoman took pity of that my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and truſting to my Honeſty, became bound for that Debt, by means whereof I had my Liberty: But in a Months time the Regiment was quite off; and ever ſince I have been quite out of Employ. But after this I ſeveral times viſited the Gentlewoman, and found her very Melancholy, I then not knowing any of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; but at laſt prevail'd with her to tell me the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was to this effect: (I will but hint juſt on the heads of thoſe Matters that were her Ruin and my Death. I could have writ a whole Volume on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, had it not been at this time, which is precious to me, and ought to be employed in nothing elſe, but in Prayers to Almighty God for the forgiveneſs of my ſins, and to prepare me for my latter end; but I hope God will forgive me, becauſe I write nothing but Truth, to the beſt of my knowledg.)</p>
            <p>This Gentlewoman had left her 500 l. to be laid out in a Purchaſe for her ſelf during Life, and afterwards for the uſe of her Children. This money lying for ſome time dead in Dr. <hi>Edisburies</hi> hands, one of the Maſters of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, She applied her ſelf to one Mr. <hi>Samuel Hartlib</hi> to find her out a Purchaſe for the ſaid money. This <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lib,</hi> as I was informed, was a Man formerly of very good buſineſs and Credit, but at that time was very poor and needy. He brought her acquainted with one Mr. <hi>Row,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> who were the ſole Actors of a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Houſes in <hi>Buckingham-Court,</hi> tho there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral concerned, as Mr. <hi>Royor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Royley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chambers,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bayley,</hi> who had Mortgages of the ſaid 2 Houſes. But in ſhort, the purchaſe was made, and Mr. <hi>Row</hi> got in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65954:3"/>
to be Truſtee, by the help of his good Friends Mr. <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lib</hi> and Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and was confirmed ſo by a Decree in Chancery. Pray obſerve, that this 500 l. was all this poor Woman had in the World; and the Purchaſe was made for 550 l. for which fifty pounds one of the ſaid two Houſes was Mortgaged to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> at that very time: But pray note, that before the Purchaſe, ſhe told Mr. <hi>Row,</hi> that ſhe had taken up 50 <hi>l.</hi> in Houſhold Goods, and owed ſome 15 or 20 l. more, and unleſs ſhe could have an Hundred Pounds more out of her own money, (to pay off her Debts) ſhe would not meddle with it: They promiſed her faithfully that ſhe ſhould have it at the Sealing of the Writings, at which time the money was to be paid for the ſaid Purchaſe. But pray now obſerve, Here was the immediate Ruin to the poor Widdow, and alſo had been to her 4 ſmall Children, if her Relations had not taken them when they were juſt a going to the Pariſh, and in the long run is my unhappy End, God forgive them.</p>
            <p>At the time of receiving the money, her Truſtee Mr. <hi>Row,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> his Confederate, and Mr. <hi>Royley,</hi> and ſome others, being at a Tavern, they ſeemingly quarrelled amongſt themſelves, inſomuch, that ſhe thought they would have fought; but it was about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the money, which was over and above the real Value of the Purchaſe; and the poor Woman expecting ſtill her Hundred Pounds according to the promiſe made her, ſhe began to examine Mr. <hi>Row,</hi> on whom ſhe relied, having put all ſhe had in the World for her ſelf and four Children to live upon, into his Truſt, Where is my Hundred Pounds, that I may carry it home and pay my Debts? Whereupon Mr. <hi>Row</hi> ſaid, Do you ſee Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam what Rogues theſe are? they have received the money this Morning; Hang them, Hang them, never trouble your ſelf, as I am your Truſtee, I'le ſerve you,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65954:4"/>
and indeed he has ſerv'd her, and me too, as you will find in the Sequel of this unhappy Paper. Says <hi>Row, Madam, I have Fifty Pounds in my Trunk which has not ſeen day this Seven Years, you ſhall have that to morrow; and my Credit can raiſe you Fifty or an Hundred Pound more in a day or two's time.</hi> This was about <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi> 1690. but on what day I cannot tell, becauſe I have not the Writings: But from the day of her paying the money, ſhe could ſcarce ever ſee Mr. <hi>Row;</hi> but when ſhe did, he made frivolous Excuſes of paying away a great Sum of money, and ſuch like; but that he was a raiſing money, which ſhe ſhould have this day, and the other day; but alas his Credit could not raiſe Five Pounds in the whole World at that time, as I was credibly informed; and as all perſons that knew him do know to be true, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame time either a Priſoner at large in the Kings Bench, or a Soldier in one of the Companies of Kings-Guards for his Protection. This is moſt certainly true, when the Widdow, and others of her Acquaintance informed me of the truth of this, ſhe then intreated, and begg'd of me with Tears and Prayers, to aſſiſt her in this her deplorable Condition. I could not refuſe it her, conſidering the great Obligation ſhe had firſt laid on me: Therefore out of Gratitude I could do no leſs than help her. Now for what paſt after, I can affirm to be Truth of my own Knowledg: As I am a dying Man I will not ſay any thing but what is Truth, to the beſt of my knowledg. Now ſhe being deluded by him and his Confederate Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and ſhe not having the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds according to promiſe, out of her own money, ſhe was preſently ruined, loſt her Credit with her Creditors, to whom ſhe promiſed payment at that time when ſhe made the Purchaſe, and ſo day after day, and week after week, as he promiſed her ſhe ſhould have it by his procurement, which he could not perform, by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65954:4"/>
reaſon of his baſe dealing in the World. At this time ſhe had a Houſe very well furniſhed in the City, and was forced to abſent her Houſe, and leave her Children and Servants only there; and ſhe was forced day after day to take Goods out of her Houſe, to diſpoſe of to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her Children, and follow him up and down from Tavern to Tavern, in expectation of his raiſing her the Hundred Pounds, which ſhe could not do her ſelf, by reaſon the Eſtate in Law was in him: But now pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the two Houſes were ſold her as well Tenanted then at 40 l. <hi>per annum</hi> each Houſe, out of which there was 30 <hi>l. per annum</hi> Ground-Rent to be paid; but no ſooner was the Purchaſe money paid, but the Tenants left the Houſes, being only Tenants at Will; ſo that the Houſes lay empty all this while, and the Ground-Rent and Kings Taxes running on, ſhe was head and ears up in Debt; and no body would take the Houſes, becauſe Mr. <hi>Row</hi> was concerned: So that ſhe was forced to quit her Houſe ſhe then lived in in the City, and live in one of her own Houſes.</p>
            <p>Now comes the diſmal Story of the Hundred Pounds borrowed of Dr. <hi>Clinch,</hi> which was the occaſion of her Ruine, and my unhappy Misfortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Row</hi> not performing his promiſe of ſupplying her with the Hundred Pounds, ſhe applied her ſelf to Dr. <hi>Clinch,</hi> who was her very good Friend, and her Husbands before her. He furniſhed her with the money, and paid it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly; but would not lend it, unleſs Mr. <hi>Row</hi> would joyn with her in a Leaſe or Mortgage of one of the two Houſes, and be bound with her for the money, becauſe ſhe could make no Security her ſelf; which he readily did, that he might the better defraud her. But at that time, Counſellor <hi>Fairbeard</hi> being out of Town at <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> the Dr. would do nothing till his return, only in the mean time he ſupplied her with 30 l. at three ſeveral

times, and paid it thus, 15 <hi>l.</hi> at one time, and 10 <hi>l.</hi> at another, and 5 <hi>l.</hi> at another; which Mr. <hi>Row</hi> received to redeem her Goods which ſhe had pawned to ſupply her neceſſities. It is true, he did redeem ſome of her Goods, but ſhe could not have any Account of the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of her money, till at laſt Mr. <hi>Fairbeard</hi> coming to Town, and the Writings were drawn by him, and afterwards ſealed, and this was not till <hi>November</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; the remainder of the money was paid by Dr. <hi>Clinch</hi>'s Order at Sir <hi>Francis Child</hi>'s Shop at <hi>Temple-Bar;</hi> but at the receiving of it, there a diſpute aroſe betwixt Mr. <hi>Row</hi> and the Widdow, Mr. <hi>Row</hi> not permitting her to receive the money, unleſs he had 20 <hi>l.</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that there was ſo much due to him by a Bill he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered her the Night before; which was a baſe, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Bill; and withall, that there was Monies rather due to the Widdow from Mr. <hi>Row,</hi> upon a fair Account betwixt them; but nevertheleſs the Widdow ſaid in my hearing, Mr. <hi>Row</hi> take ten or fifteen pounds, and let us go to the next Tavern, and take you one, and I will take another, to adjuſt the Accounts betwixt us: No ſaid <hi>Row,</hi> Madam you ſhall not receive a penny, unleſs I have 20 <hi>l.</hi> and then I will meet you at the Tavern, which he then had: So ſhe and I went to the Tavern, Mr. <hi>Row</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed he would come to us to ſettle the Accounts, we ſtay'd two hours for him, and then he ſent word, he had met with ſome perſons about other buſineſs, and could not come, but would wait on her another time at her own Houſe; but he never came at her, tho ſhe ſent for him ſeveral times, but kept out of the way, all her Concerns lying at Random; her hands being tyed ſo, that ſhe could do nothing without him, as to the letting of the other Houſe, and ſeveral other matters too tedious now to mention.</p>
            <p>Now pray obſerve, That the Dr. at the time the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65954:5"/>
were Sealed, or thereabouts, aſſigned over the ſame Security, or made ſome other Security, or Mortgage to <hi>Row</hi> of the ſaid Houſe; <hi>Row</hi> giving the Dr. Bond to ſee the Covenants performed in the Deeds made from Mr. <hi>Row</hi> (being Truſtee) and the Widow, to Dr. <hi>Clinch;</hi> which Covenants were theſe, That the Dr. ſhould be paid Quarterly 6 <hi>l.</hi> odd Money, and ſo continue till the Doctor's whole Money was paid, which would be in Five years time or thereabouts: Now pray alſo obſerve, That the laſt Money was but paid in <hi>November</hi> 1690, and the firſt quarterly Payment became due at Quarter-day next following. For the Dr. expected that quarterly Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the time he had lent the firſt 30<hi>l.</hi> at 15<hi>l.</hi> one time, 10<hi>l.</hi> another, and 5<hi>l.</hi> another; as I firſt mentioned: Tho the Caſe is intricate, I would make it as plain as I can, that the Truth may be underſtood: For <hi>Row</hi> ſeveral times ſaid he had done that which would puzzle 20 Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, That Mr. <hi>Row</hi> made it his Buſineſs both to the Widows Relations, and other People concerned with her, that I had ruined her, and ſpent all ſhe had, when as you may find by this, that all ſhe had was but 500<hi>l.</hi> and it was every Penny of it paid away for the Purchaſe; and that ſhe only had Forty One Pounds Fifteen Shillings, moſt of which, was paid away at the receiving of it, to ſome of her Creditors. And that for 3 Months I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported her and her Children, partly with my own Money, and by getting in Debts that were due to her, beſides an endleſs Trouble I had in bringing Mr. <hi>Row</hi> to an Account, which is not yet done.</p>
            <p>It is deſired that her Relations will take notice, that at the time of the Purchaſe, and at the payment of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, after Mr. <hi>Row</hi> got in to be Truſtee, he got her to ſign a Deed, particularly a Covenant in the Deed was to this or like effect, That after the Death of Mrs. <hi>Vauricke</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65954:6"/>
and her 4 Children, the Eſtate to come to him and his Heirs. Upon which I often uſed to ſay, That he deſigned to break the Widdows Heart, and Starve the Children, that the Eſtate might come to him and his Son.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Row</hi> being Truſtee, and alſo having a Deed from the Dr. for which he was glad; he domineered and ranted about, ſaying, That he had Houſes in <hi>Buckingham</hi> Court, and kept the poor Woman under, that ſhe durſt not do any thing, neither could ſhe, by reaſon of his being Truſtee, and alſo having that Deed from the Dr. But now I knowing the abuſes done the poor Woman, and that ſhe could never get him to come to any Account, ſhe applied her ſelf to me again to right her, if I could by any means: Upon which I went to Mr. <hi>Fairbeard</hi> and told him what had paſt; and that Mr. <hi>Row</hi> was an ill man; and that we could never get him to come to any Account, as he promiſed he would do in his hearing at Sir <hi>Francis Child's</hi> Shop, he being then preſent: Mr. <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beard</hi> ſaid he could not believe it, for Mr. <hi>Row</hi> was a man of Credit and Reputation; and as he told him, he was an Attorny of the Common-Pleas. I made anſwer, that he was no ſuch man, but an Impoſtor and a Cheat: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he adviſed me to go to Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> the Prothono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary at the Temple, and ſearch whether he was an Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the Common-Pleas or no; and if he was not, I ſhould take a Summons from my Lord Chief Juſtice, and he would come and juſtifie he own'd himſelf to be an Attorney of the Common-Pleas, and ſo by that means have him turned out from being Truſtee: Now I finding him not to be ſo, I did take out a Summons from my Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common-Pleas, and Mr. <hi>Row</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me according to the Summons, deſired me to let him alone, and he would come to an Account, and deliver up his Truſt, and do any thing elſe I would have him; and this he promiſed before Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> of the Temple, an
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65954:6"/>
Attorny of the Common Pleas; but for 3 weeks or a month after, we could neither ſee nor hear of him, till one came and informed us that he was to be a Witneſs in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and there we had a Summons from my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt,</hi> to appear before him; which was done: And being before my Lord, we had a ſmall hearing of the Cauſe, as I may call it; for we had there Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> of the Temple our Counſel, and my Lord hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was alledged againſt him, told him, that he was an ill man, and ſaid thus to <hi>Row, You are a fine Fellow to be a Truſtee.</hi> My Lord finding that he was a Truſtee made in Chancery, adviſed us to make an end, and ſpoke thus to Mr. <hi>Lloyd, As you are her Counſel, let Mr.</hi> Row <hi> take another, and make an end; for the poor Woman will be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined,</hi> or to this effect. Mr. <hi>Row</hi> readily anſwer'd he would, and that he would bring Mr. <hi>H.</hi> (any one may judge the meaning of that.)</p>
            <p>The time and place being appointed, Mr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> the Widow, and my ſelf, went there, where we met Mr. <hi>Row,</hi> and 2 or 3 Fellows of his Gang, but no Mr. <hi>H.</hi> was there; Mr. <hi>Row</hi> ſaid, what ſhould I have Counſel, I can do my buſineſs my ſelf; Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> told him, he was not to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the Caſe with him but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and they two were to make an end, if they could agree; whereupon Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> was angry with him, and went away: So that he was then upon the Hide and Seek again, putting us every day to great Expences; for he did not care to part with his Truſteeſhip: And for us to come to my Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice again, would put the Widow to more Charges, and that my Lord could do nothing in it, becauſe he was a Truſtee in Chancery.</p>
            <p>Now what to do we could not tell, but we then peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the Lords Commiſſioners, and Mr. Serjeant <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne</hi> our Counſel: Upon hearing what was alledged againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Row,</hi> the Lord Commiſſioner <hi>Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:65954:7"/>
ſaid, it was the moſt barbarous Caſe he ever heard. Pray note, That <hi>Row</hi> was to appear that day but durſt not; knowing the Villany that he had committed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by an Order of Court, a Meſſenger was ordered to take <hi>Mr. Row</hi> into Cuſtody; (the Petition and Orders ought to be inſerted here, but that my little time I have to live ought to be otherwiſe employed.) Now after the Meſſenger was awarded againſt him, he abſconded himſelf from his Dwelling-houſe, and all other places he then uſed; ſo that the Meſſenger of the Chancery <hi>Mr. Buſh,</hi> and my ſelf, daily hunting after him for near the ſpace of a month, but could not take him. Pray obſerve here, that this was in <hi>April</hi> 1691. and alſo obſerve, that from <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> before till that time, <hi>Mr. Row</hi> daily and hourly threatned to ſeiſe her Goods, and take poſſeſſion; and ſhe did leave her Houſe for fear of it, for ſome little time, expecting to be relieved by the Lords Commiſſioners, but ſhe left her Children and Maid in poſſeſſion: Now <hi>Row</hi> by force entred, without any manner of Law; for he turned the Children out of Doors, and ſold the Bed from under them, and took the reſt of the Goods that were in the Houſe. Now is the time that Dr. <hi>Clinch's</hi> Name comes to be mentioned, and I beg of you obſerve, I will make it as clear as I can, and ſpeak nothing but the Truth to the beſt of my Knowledg, and as I hope to ſee God in Glory. Now when <hi>Mr. Row</hi> had turned the poor Fatherleſs Children out of Doors, &amp;c. Then the Widow applied her ſelf to the Dr. and told him what had paſt, and wondered why he would not keep the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in his own hands, but make it over to <hi>Row:</hi> Said ſhe to the Dr. I dare truſt you with all I have in the World. I am now uſing endeavours to get <hi>Row</hi> turned out of his Truſteeſhip, and bring him to an Account for the money he owes me, and the Goods he has wronged me of; for he twice robbed the Houſe of the Locks, Keys
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65954:7"/>
and Bolts, under pretence of his being Truſtee. I hope no body can call it any thing elſe but Robbery, when ſhe owed him nothing, but he was in her Debt 50 l. or thereabouts, and ſhe could not take the Law of him, becauſe he was her Truſtee. So that the Widow ſolicited the Dr. ſeveral times with a great many Prayers and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, to ſtand her Friend till ſuch time as he was righted in Chancery.</p>
            <p>And now was the time that <hi>Row</hi> applied himſelf to the Dr. and inſinuated himſelf ſo far into the Doctors favour as to make him believe that it was all falſe; and that he was the wronged man, and that ſhe owed him a great deal of moneys, and withall told him, that it was not he that had ruined the Widow and Fatherleſs, but one <hi>Mr. Harriſon,</hi> who was a Gameſter, and ſpent and play'd away all her money; and ſo <hi>Mr. Row</hi> and his Agents made it their buſineſs to make him believe ſo, and every one elſe that was concerned, but more particularly her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, fearing leſt they ſhould undertake her juſt Cauſe, being monied People, and perſons of great Note and Credit; and he did effect his deſign, for from that time till now her Relations would not look upon her, nor hear any thing of her, becauſe he had ſo beſpattered her concerning me.</p>
            <p>Now was the time I told her, that I would uſe my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and intereſt with the Dr. who was my very good Friend, and for ſeveral years had known him; for he had been my Phyſitian; and many times when he ſaw me, told me he would come Day or Night to ſerve me, if I had need for him. Nay further than that, at the time the Duke of <hi>Norfolks</hi> Regiment was to be raiſed, he told me, if I would have a Commiſſion in that Regiment, he had that Intereſt with the Duke, that he believed he could do any thing with him; but I told him I was engaged to a Perſon of Quality already. Now let the Reader
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65954:8"/>
judge, whether or no I had any reaſon to injure the Dr. or much more to Murder him. Now was the time alſo I ſolicited the Dr. upon the Widows Account, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhewed me Civility and Reſpect, and never an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry word paſt betwixt us. And alſo about this time the Dr. imploy'd one <hi>Mr. Johnſon</hi> of <hi>Furnivals-Inn,</hi> to look after the buſineſs: Says the Dr. <hi>Mr. Harriſon,</hi> I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Law, and beſides that, I have a great deal of buſineſs otherwiſe, I cannot trouble my ſelf; but I have left it all to <hi>Mr. Johnſon:</hi> Upon this, I told the Widow what the Dr. had done, That he had left it all to one <hi>Mr. Johnſon;</hi> whereupon ſhe replied, That ſhe was got out of the Frying-pan into the Fire, for her Relations knew who he was; but I was altogether a Stranger to <hi>Mr. Johnſon.</hi> Now pray obſerve, that at that time all our Applications to the Dr. or <hi>Mr. Johnſon,</hi> was to let her have a little more money, till ſhe had made an end in Chancery, and got <hi>Row</hi> out from his Truſteeſhip; for ſhe intended to undertake ſome Imploy to maintain her ſelf and Children, and that the Dr. ſhould have poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both the Houſes for his Security; and we would endeavour to get a Decree in Chancery for that purpoſe. The Dr. and I many times argued the Caſe, and once or twice, computed the In-come of the Eſtate, and what might be lent upon it: The Dr. was ſenſible of the Wrongs done the Widow, and would have helped her in any thing, if Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> had not prevented him. Now you muſt underſtand the Widow could do nothing to help her ſelf as to raiſing of Mony, for theſe 2 Reaſons: Firſt, Becauſe <hi>Row</hi> was Truſtee, and not then turned out, nor is yet; as you will underſtand by the Sequel of the Story: So now to come back to Mr. <hi>Row,</hi> where I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned him as to his abſconding himſelf; that the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger could not take him, whereas by an other Order, made the Twenty Sixth day of <hi>May,</hi> 1691. It was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65954:8"/>
one Mr. <hi>Royor</hi> and <hi>Royley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and Dr. <hi>Clinch,</hi> were to attend Sir <hi>John Hoſkyns,</hi> about the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in queſtion; for you muſt know, that we had the wole Buſineſs on the Stage, as to all the Perſons concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in putting that Purchaſe upon her, and by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and means <hi>Mr. Row</hi> got in to be Truſtee. Now this was the time that Dr. <hi>Clinch</hi> firſt began to be diſpleaſed, and ſo was <hi>Mr. Fairbeard</hi> his Counſel, and <hi>Mr. Johnſon,</hi> for bringing his, Name in queſtion, where ſo black a Caſe appeared to the Lords Commiſſioners, on <hi>Row</hi>'s Account, ſaying, <hi>Have not I lent my Mony, and paid it honeſtly?</hi> Yes, Sir, I know it; but <hi>Row</hi> received the moſt of it, and the Widow cannot get an Account of it; and it was by our Counſel's Advice that we did it; for by the Dr's appearing before the Mr. in Chancery, all was made clear, how Mr. <hi>Row</hi> and his Confederates were the Perſons that had ruined the Widow and her Children, as by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port does appear, which ought to be inſerted here. But no more of that. I hope now her Relations will have pity of her diſconſolate condition, being the moſt wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Widow in the World, to whom I have ordered the Papers of the Proceedings of her Cauſe to be carefully delivered. Only thus much of the Report made by Sir <hi>John Hoskyns,</hi> which I ſhewed my Lord Chief Juſtice at my Tryal. But he told me, it would ſignifie nothing to my Tryal; which is thus <hi>verbatim.</hi> And as for Dr. <hi>Clinch</hi> his matter, I find that the ſaid Dr. <hi>Clinch</hi> was deſired by the ſaid <hi>Mrs Vauwick</hi> and <hi>Mr. Row,</hi> preſently after the ſaid Purchaſe of the ſaid 2 Houſes, to lend the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Vauwick</hi> an Hundred Pound to furniſh one of the ſaid Houſes; and there being a Debt of 14 <hi>l.</hi> that was due to Dr. <hi>Clinch</hi> from the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Vauwick</hi>'s late Husband Deceaſed, and about 3 <hi>l.</hi> 17 <hi>s.</hi> for Intereſt thereof, the ſaid Dr. <hi>Clinch</hi> did lend the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Vauwick</hi> Two Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas more, which made it up Twenty Pounds; and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65954:9"/>
ſaid Mrs. <hi>Vauwick</hi> ſecured the ſaid Twenty Pounds by her Bond; and the ſaid Dr. <hi>Clinch</hi> at their, the ſaid <hi>Row</hi> and <hi>Vauwick</hi>'s Deſire, did undertake to lend it, upon his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecured the ſaid 100 <hi>l.</hi> and the ſaid 20 <hi>l.</hi> in all 120 <hi>l.</hi> by a Mortgage of one of the ſaid Two Houſes, to be paid at times in the Deeds for that purpoſe mentioned, the which 100 <hi>l.</hi> I find was paid, and diſpoſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thus, 41 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s.</hi> to the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Vauwick,</hi> 5 <hi>l.</hi> to Mr. <hi>Fairbeard</hi> and his Clerk for Writings, 3 <hi>l.</hi> for the enſuring Mrs. <hi>Vauwick</hi>'s Life, and 50 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Row</hi> for the uſe of Mrs <hi>Vauwick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we having got this Report, all our buſineſs was done with Dr. <hi>Clinch,</hi> and this Report was Signed, <hi>8th of Auguſt</hi> 1691. by Sir <hi>John Hoskyns.</hi> By this Report it appears, who wronged the Widow, as you will find alſo by a Petition here inſerted, upon which the Widow was to have an Hearing.

Now pray obſerve, that the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was Arreſted about Two Months, or thereabouts, before the Dr. was murdered, and not at his Suit. Pray take notice, and withal obſerve the part of the Report
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65954:10"/>
inſerted here, relating to Dr. <hi>Clinch,</hi> and alſo the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and likewiſe who it is that was in the wrong, and who had ruined the Widow, whether Dr. <hi>Clinch</hi> or <hi>Row.</hi> And now to whom any Malice or Revenge ought to be done, whether to the Doctor, who had honeſtly paid the Mony, or to <hi>Row,</hi> who had not only, with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, (the Perſons formerly mentioned) cheated her above an Hundred Pounds in the Purchaſe, and alſo 2 Quarters Rents, as the reſt of the Report makes out, and alſo as you find by the Report here, 50 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſhe being Arreſted, and in the Compter Two Months before the Drs. Death, and not at his Suit, let all the World judge, whether or no the Dr. was murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her Account or no. And I do proteſt in the Preſence of Almighty God, and as I hope for Salvation, I had not ſpoken to the Dr. in 3 Months time before his Death, the laſt time being at his own Houſe, to my beſt remembrance. And Dr. <hi>Clinch</hi>'s own Coachman owned to me, That he believed it was about 3 Months. And pray let the Reader conſider, that there was no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage could be had, and that it would be nothing in the Widows way, if it had pleaſed God that Dr. <hi>Clinch</hi> had died in his Bed. And alſo obſerve, that the Widow had not Five Shillings at that time, nor could not tell where to get one Guinea in the World, if it could have procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her Liberty: For at that time her Acquaintance were making a Purſe for her, to bring her <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus;</hi> for the Marſhal told me, he would take my Word for her Liberty: Therefore you muſt know by this ſhe had no Mony to give me to hire a Ruffian. Now it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God that Dr. <hi>Clinch</hi> was moſt barbarouſly murdered, on the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> betwixt 9 and 11 at Night. I need not mention the manner, becauſe 'tis too well known. Now it being ſuch a barbarous black Deed, ſtartled all the Town. It ſeems, before the next Night it was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65954:10"/>
given out that Mr. <hi>Row</hi> and my Self knew the 2 Ruffians that committed this Fact; but the next Day after it was done, being <hi>Tueſday,</hi> it was 2 a Clock before I heard of it, which was at <hi>Joe</hi>'s Coffee Houſe going into <hi>Salisbury</hi>-Court, where I was told of the Murther, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of it, as they heard it was done: I remember very well what I ſaid, Theſe were the boldeſt daring Villains I ever heard of; What, to Murther a Man in the open Streets, and at that time of the Night, and carry him through the City in a Coach when all the Watch was ſet? And I do remember that I took Pen and Ink, and writ a Letter to the Widow in the <hi>Compter,</hi> which was to this or the like Effect: <hi>Madam, I juſt now have heard of the blackeſt inhuman Murther that ever was known; but before this I ſuppoſe you have heard of it, becauſe it is all over the Town, if not, it's thus: Doctor</hi> Clinch <hi>was laſt Night barbarouſly Murthered in a Coach in</hi> Leaden Hall-<hi>ſtreet.</hi> And ſo writ, as I heard how it was done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſame Night I was at one <hi>Clinch</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe in <hi>Mitre</hi>-Court, where every one was talking of it, for it was a general Diſcourſe. The ſame Night I was to ſee for a Gentleman there who ow'd me Mony, and he came in whilſt I was there, and told me, that he had received a Bill out of the Country, and deſired me to meet him at the <hi>Sugar-Loaf</hi> in <hi>White Fryers,</hi> and dine with him the next Day; which Words were ſpoke publickly. Upon which, I ſuppoſe, the Conſtable was directed; for the next Day I came there, and enquired for the Gentleman, and they told me he was at <hi>Clinch</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe; and going there, I met the Conſtable, who as ſoon as he ſaw me, ſaid thus, or to the like Effect; Mr. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> I am ſorry to meet with you, I have my Lord Chief Juſtice's Warrant againſt you: For what? ſaid I. Go to the <hi>Sugar-Loaf</hi> and I'll tell you, ſaid he; yes, with all my Heart. When we came there, ſeveral of Dr. <hi>Clinch</hi>'s Friends
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65954:11"/>
were there; what paſt is not material: So they carried me to the Conſtable's Houſe in <hi>Grays-Inn-Lane,</hi> where we ſtaid about 2 Hours, becauſe my Lord was buſie there: We diſcourſed about Mr. <hi>Row,</hi> and the Buſineſs on which I have writ before, and I told them, I had not ſeen Mr. <hi>Row</hi> this long time, nor the Dr. to my Knowledg, for <hi>Row</hi> and I were perfect Enemies, not knowing then he was ſuſpected to be one with me; but being brought before my Lord, <hi>Row</hi> was there; and he brought Witnesſes where he was, and Bail with him: But now pray obſerve my failing, I being ſurprized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examin'd w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere I was, I told my Lord; That I was at ſuch a Place fhrom 7 or 8 or thereabouts, till 11 or thereabouts; but not having the Perſons there to juſtifie it, I was ſent to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and <hi>Row</hi> Bailed. Now pray obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Row</hi> and my ſelf were ſuſpected then to be the 2 perſons; now I being committed, and a ſcandalous Libel coming out the next Day, made all the World believe I was the Man that committed it. I was almoſt Diſtracted, and I thank God that he did not give me over to Deſpair; but at laſt I was a little ſetled in my Mind, and began to conſider, That it was for my Sins, my former Sins, he ſuffer'd this Judgment to come upon me, and I became calm and conſidered, and did, and ever ſince have, bleſſed be his Holy Name for this his Fatherly Chaſtiſement; and he has ever ſince given me Patience under all my Sufferings, and ſupported me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all my Afflictions till this time; and I truſt and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, he will not forſake me at the Hour of my Death. After a day or two being in Priſon, I ſent for the People of the Houſe where I was, and deſired them to recollect themſelves what time I came there, and how long I ſtaid there; and ſent to thoſe Perſons that were in Company, to know certainly the time, for they were all partly Strangers to me: I had an Account given
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65954:11"/>
me, for I could not recollect every thing my ſelf; but you will underſtand in my Caſe following: And when my Witneſſes had given me the ſatisfaction, the Seſſions coming on about 10 days after, I had all my Witneſſes there, and Petitioned for my Tryal; but was put off, becauſe the Coroner had not brought in his Inqueſt. Now pray obſerve, that the Coroner had been with me, and took my Examination, before that Seſſions; and promiſed me he would let me have two days notice of my Tryal; but he did not: So that I tired my Friends with wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and my Witneſſes being Strangers, that Expence was all loſt. Now knowing my Innocency, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Proſecutors deſired nothing more than to find out the Truth, I frankly ſent them a Copy of my Caſe, and alſo another to the Coroner; the doing of which was my ruin: And I told my Lord the ſame at my Tryal; and he made Anſwer, "I was to blame in that: And thus it was <hi>Verbatim.</hi>

            <p>Now let any one judge, whether it looks like as if I were guilty, to give my Adverſaries an Account of my Witneſſes, and what they could teſtifie for me: But my Deſign in this, was That when they had found what I ſaid to be true, I was in hopes they would have ſuffer'd me to Bail: But inſtead of that it turned to my ruin; for Dr. <hi>Clinch</hi>'s Coach man went to them, and abuſed them all, and every Body elſe that took my part; but however the ſecond Seſſions coming on, all my friends and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes attended two Days in hopes of my Tryal; my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes being in the ſame Houſe where theirs was, and they ſeeing me ſo well provided, my Tryal was put off till the third Seſſions, upon pretence that they had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſomething more. Now I being in Priſon, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mony, and had given them all this trouble, and waiting two Seſſions, all the time of the Seſſions, they were very uneaſie; beſides being abuſed by Dr. <hi>Clinch</hi>'s Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, they would not trouble themſelves any more. But this I had forgot, that moſt of them denied coming, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaid they ſhould be abuſed and vilified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Murther was ſo black that was laid to my Charge. Whereupon I was forced to Petition the Lord Chief Juſtice for <hi>Subpoenas,</hi> which was granted me, which was both a great Charge and Trouble, I being confined, that I could not look after it my ſelf; tho' I was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I ſhould either be Tryed or Balled; but inſtead of that I was more ſtrictly confined. Now From the laſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65954:13"/>
Seſſions till this, my Enemies were at work how to bring their Deſigns about; the firſt thing I heard was, That there was a Boy made away, and, as it was reported, by my Contrivance; and then he was put in the Gazette; but not being found out, at my Tryal his Examination was produced as an Evidence, which was allowed of as good, according to Law, and I believe it might be ſo, becauſe my Lord Chief Juſtice ſaid it was Law. Now I do proteſt I never heard of any Boy an Evidence againſt me, till it was told me in the Preſs-yard, That a Boy was made away that was an Evidence againſt me; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I anſwered, Why did they not try me laſt Seſſions, for then they had the Boy? But I found there was no occaſion for him this Seſſions, conſidering the two young Maids this Seſſions, one concerning the Handkerchief and the other ſeeing me in the Coach at <hi>Brownlowſtreet</hi>-end, as you will hear anon; God forgive them and thoſe that put them upon it. Now this Seſſions coming on, I was forced to have Subpena's, and the ſame Charge and Trouble again as I had been at before: But now it was too late, for Mr. <hi>White</hi> and his Wife kept out of the way, and ſo that they could not be found, nor did appear: I know not the Reaſon, but God forgive them, I fear there was foul Dealing. Mrs. <hi>Whiple</hi> did not appear, and the Maid could not come, becauſe the Houſe could not be left alone. Now the Day of my Tryal being come they would have put it off again, but that my Lord Chief Juſtice would not ſuffer it, and I preſſing for it, it was granted me; and I muſt own my Lord had all the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence imaginable, ſo that I can find no Fault with Judges or Jury. I will now mention the moſt remarkable Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages that I can remember as to the Evidence againſt me. The firſt was, to ſatisfie the Court the occaſion of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuſpected to be one of the Perſons that committed the Fact, about the Hundred and twenty Pounds lent by the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65954:13"/>
Doctor to the Widow, my Acquaintance; but what he ſwore I cannot remember; but as I was informed, he was the Perſon that gave the firſt Suſpicion of me to be the Man; if ſo, God forgive him, for I had not ſeen him in three Months before the Doctor was murthered. The next that ſwore (for I cannot remember every thing, but this Paſſage) That I came to his Chamber, and laid my Hand upon my Sword, and ſaid, I would be reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Doctor: It is falſe, as I am a dying Man; for there was no Diſcourſe of the Doctor, but Matters relating to himſelf; for the Doctor was always willing to do any thing for the Widow's Good, but was prevented by him. As for the two Witneſſes at the Coffee-Houſe, that ſwore that I ſaid, That I ſhould ſay, <q rend="margQuotes">God D—him, he ought to have his Throat cut.</q> And the Woman more particularly ſwore this, that I ſaid, <q rend="margQuotes">What, would he have a Woman of your Quality go to Service? G.D. him, he ought to have his Throat cut.</q> Pray obſerve, this Woman comes to <hi>Newgate.</hi> I coming to her, ſaid, Mrs. <hi>Joe,</hi> I wonder you can ſleep in your Bed, knowing the Wrongs you have done me; ſhe preſently anſwered, <q rend="margQuotes">Lord! Captain <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> all I ſaid was, That you ſaid he ought to be hanged, but I believe it was in your Paſſion, and I really think you are as Innocent as I am:</q> Which was the reaſon why I asked in Court, What ſhe had for ſwearing that? This is true upon my Salvation.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry that I have not the Trial, and then I could better anſwer it: And I will not tell a Lye, now I am going out of the World, therefore would only hint at thoſe things I am ſure are falſe, and will not name any Perſon, but leave it to God to touch their Hearts in his due Time, for it cannot be expected I can remember all that was ſaid in Court; I will only mention the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sayings, and let them remember it after my Death. As to the Witneſs that ſaid, I was at his Lodgings at nine
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65954:14"/>
a Clock exactly, and that I had a Gentleman ſtaying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for me, and that I had urgent Buſineſs to do that Night, and ſeveral other Diſcourſes about the poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that Night: God forgive him for being poſitive to an Hour; I might have believed it might have been that Time he ſwore, if Circumſtances relating to the Gown, which he may know (by reading the Account of my Defence before mentioned) muſt ſatisfie him to the contrary, though I fear the World cannot underſtand my Meaning; but I write this meerly for himſelf, that he may recollect himſelf of what he has done; when he knows in his Conſcience my Buſineſs was another thing.</p>
            <p>Now as to that Man in the <hi>Compter,</hi> who ſwore that the Night before the inhuman Murther was done, I was there, and being in Diſcourſe with the Widow, he hearkned at the Door, and heard me ſay, G. D. me, I would have the Blood of <hi>Hinch</hi> or <hi>Clinch.</hi> This, or to the like effect, was what he ſwore; I never ſaid, I would be the Death of <hi>Hinch</hi> or <hi>Clinch</hi> in my Life, as I muſt appear at the Judgment Seat of God to anſwer it. As to that poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I pity her, whoſe Evidence was, That I was at her Houſe on S. <hi>Thomas Day</hi> laſt, and had on a Black Shabby Sute, I think, were her Words. Upon my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation it is falſe, for I have not had a Black Coat on in three Months Time, before the Doctor was murthered, as ſeveral can Teſtifie, nor never wore any Coat but that I had on when I was brought before my Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which was the ſame I had on at my Tryal, in three Months Time before the Murther: I ſhall anſwer her Evidence no more.</p>
            <p>As to the 2 Maids, I never heard of them as Evidences againſt me till I ſaw them in Court; therefore you will think I had a hard Task to go through; but God be thanked he ſupported me then, and believe he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65954:14"/>
it to me, and alſo aſſiſt me at the Hour of my Death.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt Maid or Girl, about fifteen or ſixteen Years old, as I take her to be, ſhe keeps her Mother's Apple-ſhop: Her Evidence was, I told her, That I was a Parliament Man, and that one Day being out of the Room, ſhe ſaw a Handkerchief there, and went to the Maid below, and ſaid, Can this be a Parliament Man, and have ſuch a Handkerchief as this? of ſuch a like Piece the Maid had an Apron, and they compared them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they were almoſt alike. Now the Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that was about the Doctors Neck, when he was Murthered, was produced in Court; and ſhe ſwore that was the Hankerchief, or very like it: This was her Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. To the beſt of my Knowledg, or to the ſame Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, upon my Salvation, it is falſe, for I never in my Life ſaid I was a Parliament Man: or ever had I ſuch a Handkerchief in all my Life as that was, to the beſt of my Knowledg.</p>
            <p>As to the other Maid who ſwore, That ſhe ſaw me by the glimmering of a Lamp in the Coach, at the end of <hi>Brownlow</hi> Street, and heard me talk, and was with me in Priſon, and heard my Voice before ſhe came into the Room where I was, and ſaid, That was the Voice that I heard in the Coach that Night when the Doctor was Murthered. And I asked, Why ſhe did not declare it before? Which my Lord Chief Juſtice obſerved; but the Gentleman who was Council againſt me, as I take it, put into her Head, and ſaid, it was Scruple of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and that her Mother, or ſome Body elſe, would not let her meddle in ſuch a dangerous Buſineſs. God forgive her, ſhe did my Buſineſs; and God forgive them that put her upon it.</p>
            <p>As to that Perſon who ſwore I ſaid I was but juſt come out of <hi>Kent,</hi> and had been out of Town a Fortnight or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65954:15"/>
three Weeks: God forgive him, I leave it to his own Conſcience, and pray to God that he would reform his Courſe of Life. I do not ſay this as a Reflection, God forbid I ſhould, but rather as an Exhortation, that if he reads this, he may repent himſelf of the Wrongs done me.</p>
            <p>And as for the Perſon who ſwore againſt me, of my being at his Lodgings exactly at 9 a Clock, which was the occaſion of my unhappy Death, being falſe; for it was at 8, which I convinced him of in Priſon upon Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. God Almighty pardon him, and lay it to his Heart, that he may truly repent himſelf; and withal let him remember the Bond: He knows my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>I have writ theſe Remarks upon my Tryal, which will be inſignificant to Strangers; for they will be ſcarcely underſtood by any but the Parties concerned, who have falſly ſworn againſt me: And God in his due time touch their Hearts, that they may ſincerely repent themſelves; and I freely forgive them, as I hope God in his Infinite Mercy will do me at the laſt Day. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have one thing to add, That after my Condemnation, the next day a moſt ſcandalous Pamphlet came out, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>An Impartial Account of the Notorious Wicked Life of Captain</hi> Harriſon: One Paſſage in it I muſt take Notice of, which is this, My Raſcally Behaviour towards the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> when he ſuffered on <hi>Tower Hill.</hi> I thank my God no one could be more ſorry than my ſelf for his unhappy end: As to the reſt of it, being ſo ſcandalous, that all my Friends, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Acquaintance, know to the contrary: But it is hard that for the Lucre of a Penny, a Man dares write ſo many Lies; but God forgive them that did it; for he would have writ the ſame upon his own Brother upon the like Occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65954:15"/>I have writ this chiefly for my Relations, Friends and Acquaintance, who I do not fear but that they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me: And as for the reſt of the World I leave it to them to judge as they pleaſe, till it ſhall pleaſe God to bring to Light this black Deed of Darkneſs, which he certainly will at his good appointed time; <hi>Not our Will but his be done.</hi> And now to conclude, The greateſt thing that grieves me, as to this World, is, My Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but let this be their Comfort, as well as my Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, That I am Wronged, and that I am Innocent; and I do heartily beg of God to forgive thoſe that falſly Swore againſt me; and more particularly that Perſon who was the firſt Author of the Suſpicion: For I do bleſs the day wherein I was falſly Accuſed; for by that means I was brought to a ſight of my former Sins, and do acknowledge it is God's Juſtice and juſt Judgment, for which I give Praiſe to his Holy Name, that I have this time to bewail, and repent my ſelf of all my Sins, begging Pardon of all thoſe I have any ways wrong'd, forgiving heartily every one that has wronged me; even thoſe I do moſt heartily forgive who are the occaſion of my Death; as I hope God will forgive me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me unto his Everlaſting Kingdom, through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, his only Son, my Lord and Saviour. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            </opener>
            <p>NOw accept of any hearty thanks for all your and your Wife's Services, and loving Kindneſſes, and God Almighty reward you: I am now preparing my ſelf for another World, and do heartily forgive all my Enemies. There were four of my Witneſſes that did not appear, one Mr. <hi>White</hi> and his Wife, the Maid of the Houſe where I was, and one Mrs. <hi>Fairlace;</hi> let not God lay my Blood to their Charge, and God forgive all thoſe that ſwore falſly againſt me. And whether before my Execution or after God is pleaſed to bring to Light this Murder, I am ſure he will do it; then the World will know my Wrongs: In the mean Time I reſign my Soul and Body to him, who is a juſt God, and by this Means will bring me to himſelf. This Affliction is a great one, and more than Human Nature can bear; but I truſt in him, that he will not lay more on me than he will give me the Grace if his Holy Spirit to undergo, and indeed I look upon it as a Fatherly Chaſtiſement; for whom he loves he chaſtiſes: For if I had my Deſerts he might have taken me in the midſt of all my Sins, and have rewarded me with the Puniſhment of the everlaſting Priſon (Hell) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for all impenitent Sinners; but I hope he will give me the Grace of his Holy Spirit, to repent my ſelf of all my Sins, which I have and do, and ſhall with the Help of him, with an Humble, Lowly and Obedient Heart, and not in the leaſt Cloak or Diſſemble them, before my Heavenly Father, who gave up his only begotten Son to die for Sinners, and me the greateſt: And I hope he will give me his Grace to follow his Example, who was falſly Accuſed, Condemned and ſuffered a ſhameful Death upon the Croſs, I being now falſly accuſed, and to ſuffer a ſhameful Death; at which Time I ſincerely and heartily

beg of him, to ſupport me, which I truſt in God he will, humbly begging Pardon, and confeſſing the Sins I have been guilty of. Now, one thing I beg of you, for Chriſt his ſake, That you will take it from me, a dying Man, without the leaſt Hopes of Pardon here, from any Mortal Man, That I am Innocent, Clear and Free in Thought, Word and Deed of this Bloody, Barbarous, unheard of Murther, the which ſeveral Times I have proteſted to you my Innocence, and for which I do ſuffer; ſurely knowing and certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, no Salvation can be had from Almighty God, the Searcher of Hearts, to any one who at the Hour of Death dies with a Lie in his Mouth; therefore deſire your Prayers for me (being really Innocent) and all other good Chriſtians Prayers, <hi>That God Almighty will be pleaſed to bring to Light this Bloody Deed, not when we would have him, but at his own appointed Time; not our Will, but his be done.</hi> And I beg of you, let me ſee you, for I have deſired, That you and Coſen C—, and a Divine or two (and no Body elſe) may come to me, for I will not now Diſcourſe any Perſons relating to Worldly Affairs, but what may tend for the Salvation of my poor Soul. So recommending you to God, I reſt,</p>
