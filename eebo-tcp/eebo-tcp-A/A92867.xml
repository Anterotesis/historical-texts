            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Sad and Lamentable Caſe of the Tenants of the late Deane and Chapter of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> (conſiſting of about One hundred Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies) briefly Stated.</head>
            <p>THat the Tennants and their Anceſtors have for many hundreds of years en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed their reſpective Farmes under the Prior and Covent of <hi>Durham,</hi> and after the diſſolution in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight his time, under the Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Durham,</hi> by certain Cuſtomary Tenures and Services to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them upon the Borders of <hi>England,</hi> againſt the Frontiers of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time they were prevailed withall to take Leaſes, which was ſetled by Decree by Conſent, between the then Dean and Chapter, and the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Tennants of <hi>Durham,</hi> That they ſhould receive Leaſes according to the form preſcribed in that Decree, paying Three years Fine at the renewal of their Leaſes, after the expiration of One and twenty years.</p>
            <p>That when the Surveyors came down to Survey their Eſtates in purſuance of a Bill of Sale, the ſaid Tenants made their right as aforeſaid unto the premiſſes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; whereupon the Surveyors made a large and ample Certificate on their behalf, and returned the ſame in the Survey of their reſpective Farms.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Tenants did addreſſe themſelves to the Committee for Removing Obſtructions in the Sale of Deane and Chapters Lands, who upon mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, did allow of the ſaid Tennants Claim as aforeſaid, and Ordered a Reprize to the ſaid Tennants in the purchaſe of their ſeveral Farmes, in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Decree, as by the Order of that Committee more fully appears; which Order of Allowance was left at <hi>Gurney-houſe</hi> for the Contractors and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers to take notice of.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Tennants being miſerably impoveriſhed by reaſon of the late Warrs having Armies quartered upon them for the moſt part of five years, and moſt of their Farmes being not above the value of three pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> were not able to come up to <hi>London,</hi> and to bear the Charge of paſſing Conveyances for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Farms, and therefore reſolved to ſubmit to whoſoever ſhould purchaſe their Eſtates, and become their Landlords, reſting confident that according to their ſaid Claims and Orders of Reprizal, they would allow the ſaid Tennants to renew their Leaſes under them, as formerly they did in the time of the Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; But the ſaid Tenants do find the contrary; and notwithſtanding that they and their Anceſtors have for theſe 400 years enjoyed their reſpective F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rmes upon the Tenures and Services aforeſaid; and notwithſtanding that their Caſe is different from the Caſe of all other Tennants to Deane and Chapters in other parts of the Nation, yet are many of them thrown out of their antient Poſſeſſions, and left in the Streets in a miſerable Condition, with their Wives and Children to begg their Bread; there being ſuch inſtances to be given of the Inhumanity of ſome of the Purchaſers to the ſaid Tennants, that it is incredible what unchriſtian-like hardſhip hath been done unto them.</p>
            <closer/>
            <postscript>
               <p>The Tennants do moſt humbly pray, That their Petition (remaining in the hands of a Member of Parliament) Remonſtrating their Sad and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Condition, may be Call'd for, and Read in Parliament; that the Oppreſſed may be relieved, and that ſo many Families may not be left to periſh, for want of ſeaſonable relief.</p>
