         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In lyke maner Tobias the auncient father, and faythfull ſeruaunt of <note place="margin">Toby.</note> God, taught his yong ſonne Tobias euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der age, to feare God, and to refraine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al ſin. His admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious which he gaue to his ſonne, are ſo Godlye and profitable, ſo aduauncing vertue and repreſſing Vyce, that they may iuſtly ſéeme worthy to be written in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Golde. The Parentes of <hi>Suſanna</hi> broughte her vp from her youth, that ſhée was ſo Godly, ſo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, <note place="margin">Dany. 14,</note> and ſo honeſt, that God would not ſuffer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Iudges to preuayle againſt her. <hi>Phillip</hi> the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, <note place="margin">Act. 21.</note> which was one of the ſeauen Deacons, had fower Daughters Virgines, &amp; he brought them vp ſo Godly and learnedly, that they were able to Prophecy

Take it therefore, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéech your Worſhips with ioyfull hartes, as a good wil towardes you, for other gyfte haue I not to giue you, and I ſhall moſt humbly beſéech God to be your defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and to giue you his holy ſpiryte, which may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne you all in your doinges, that you maye walke blameleſſe in his ſight, and be fonnde in the number of Gods elect. The euerlaſting peace of God in Ieſus Chriſt, the contynuall ayd, ſtrength, ioy, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte of his moſt pure, holy, and mighty ſpirite, with the increaſe of fayth, be moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wroughte in your hartes, to your owne commodities, eternal ioy and comforte.</p>

               <p>Forſooth good maiſter, I am a Straunger hereabouts, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willing I am to go to London.</p>

               <p>To go to London (alas) what wouldſt thou do there?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Puer.</speaker>
               <p>Here in the countrey, they ſay it is a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly famous Town, and very gladly I would ſee it, if I knew the way thyther.</p>

               <p>How da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou go abroade now, the world is ſo hard, on this order? the Conſtables and other Offy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as thou goeſt, will apprehende and haue thee before ſome Iuſtice for a Rogue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>I truſt they will not doe ſo, for I neuer dwelte with Mayſter nor Dame.</p>

               <speaker>Puer.</speaker>
               <p>It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo, for in the countrey wheras I did dwell, they looke very ſtraightly vnto thoſe that are ſuſpected perſons, and haue them vnto ſome Iuſtice, and they bee not onely puniſhed with impriſonmente, but with whipping and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the eare.</p>

               <p>It is a thing chiefeſt to be loked to, for if they doe not, they ought in all

               <p>I am ſure they will not examine me ſo ſtraightly, if they doe, I muſt declare vnto them the troth, and the effecte of my matter, for I dwelte al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with my Father, and Mother, I haue come a good way, and yet I haue not bene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</p>

               <p>Then I perceyue that you did dwell with your father.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Puer.</speaker>
               <p>Yea in deede, I dwelt with my mother, but my father is dead, and lyeth buryed in the bodye of our Churche, almoſt three yeares paſt, but my mother I truſt is alyue.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Puer.</speaker>
               <p>Marye I did go to Plough and Carte, and kepte the Crowes out of the fielde, and fetch home the Kyne and other ſuch lyke thinges, which appertayne vnto huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ciuis.</speaker>
               <p>In ſo doing thou didſt well, for Adam did worke in the Garden of Eden: Cayn <note place="margin">Gene, 2.</note> was a Plough man and tilled the earth: hys <note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note> brother Abell was a Sheaphearde, and kepte Sheepe: Noye was a planter of Vyneyardes, <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> and canſt thou not liue as thy father hath done before thee?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Puer.</speaker>
               <p>What will I doe? I will tell you, I will be a Seruingman, and wayghte on a Gentleman, and then I ſhall goe a Hawking and Hunting and haue my delight as Gentlemen hath, I ſhall haue two new coates a yeare, I will haue my ſutes of Hoſe, my Hats with feathers, and be all in the brauerye, after the newe faſhyon, and ſometyme I ſhall wayght vpon a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, who woulde deſyre to lyue a merryer lyfe? or elſe I will to London to be a ſeruaunt.</p>

               <p>The old Prouerbe is true. A yong Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer, an old Begger, for they ſay ſeruice is none heritage, and if thou ſhouldeſt be vſed as Eſop doth declare in a fable, what wouldſt thou then <note place="margin">Eſop.</note> ſay to thy brauery?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Puer.</speaker>

               <p>He was a man by whome there is a booke made, that I haue read, and is caled Eſops fables, wherin he likeneth a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingman to a Greyhound.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Puer.</speaker>
               <p>He was a hore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in deede, that would liken a man to a Dog. Why there is a great ſort that be Seruingmen and doth liue well ynough, and ſo I trowe I will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ciuis.</speaker>
               <p>Yea I wil not deſpyſe ſeruingmen, for they are men neceſſary. But Eſope ſayeth, as long as a Greyhound is youthfull, and can follow his game, he ſhall be much made of, and as long as you are yong and luſtye, ſo maye you be, but when age commeth on you, as dyd on the Greyhound, then you ſhall not bee ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb facs="tcp:18315:7"/>
but ready to be ſet at liberty without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Puer.</speaker>
               <p>Why then I praye you tell me your mynde, what your aduyce is for me to doe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ciuis.</speaker>
               <p>My counſell is to haue you go home agayne to your Mother, conſydering you ſay ſhe is an old woman, and your Father dead, ſhee is without friendſhip or comforte, and you ſhall be a good ſtay and a helper vnto her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Puer.</speaker>
               <p>I mynde not ſo to doe, for I know a way better then to doe ſo, ſhe hath geuen me Gods bleſſing and hers, and is well contented withall, and hath geuen mee Money in my Purſe, I may be bolde to ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, beſydes that I take you to be an honeſt man, and a true man, elſe I woulde not haue tolde you, for there be ſo many men now a days of dyuers ſortes, I knowe not well whome to truſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ciuis.</speaker>
               <p>Thou ſayeſt truth in deede, the more is the pittie, for one man cannot truſt another, <note place="margin">What wee ought to doe to our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes.

Heare me your Father (O my deare Chyldren) and doe thereafter that ye may be ſafe, for the Lord will haue the father honoured of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Honor thy father and Mother, this is the fyrſt commaundement that hath any promyſe, that thou mayeſt be in good ſtate, and lyue long on the earth. And looke what a Mother com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth her children to doe, he will haue it kepte. Who ſo honoureth his Father, his ſinnes <note place="margin">And why?</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18315:7"/>
ſhall be forgeuen him, and he that honoreth his mother, is one that gathereth treaſure togither, who ſo honoureth his Father, ſhall haue long life, and he that is obedyent for the Lords ſake, his mother ſhall haue ioy of him.

               <speaker>Puer.</speaker>
               <p>You are verye ſcripulous with mee to honour my mother, I doe not denye it, but I confeſſe my duetye is vnto my mother, yet may I doe that which I purpoſe to doe, for I am ſure you cannot tell me of any that doth practiſe ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Father or mother. Of my parte I promiſe you, I knowe not what obedience is, for it was neuer taught me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ciuis.</speaker>
               <p>Then will I teach you eſpecially concerning our communy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Fyrſt, I will ſhew you that obedience is <note place="margin">What is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</note> a lowly and harty ſubmiſſyon of our ſelues to God, and afterwardes to our Parentes, to the Maieſtrates, to our ſuperyours, and to al thoſe to whome GOD hath committed the rule and gouernaunce of his Flocke and people in this worlde, or in iuſt cauſes, to all them to whome we be by any tytle inferyour.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Puer.</speaker>
               <p>I am therewith content, I perceyue you haue had ſome intelligence &amp; knowledge of Scriptures, that can remember ſuch thinges vpon a ſodayne, yet I may loue both father and mother, and ſhew my duety and obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, although I doe not dwell with them: For I muſt ſeeke how to behaue my ſelf, when God calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away from me, out of this vale of miſery, to get my liuing as they haue done, for if I ſhould do as the Prouerbe is, loke after ded folks ſhoes, I might tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to go barefote.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Puer.</speaker>
               <p>Mary ſyr there is ſuch moyling and toyling, and taking of great paynes, with harde fare, that I muſt needes to London to be a Townſeman, thereto liue more at eaſe.</p>

               <p>If euery one were of thy mynde, and ſo permitted to haue their owne wils, we might chaunce to faſt for lack of bread, Corne, and ſuch other neceſſaryes for mans body. But the truth is, at London thou mighteſt learne
<pb facs="tcp:18315:8"/>
ſome honeſt and profitable occupation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou mayeſt be able to get thy own liuing in tyme to come, and to make prouiſion for ſuch as ſhall belong vnto thee hereafter, for if thou ſhouldſt be brought vp ydely, thou ſhouldeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an vnprofytable member in a common weale, and for lack of liuing, fal into many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, for it is written. Send him to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <note place="margin">Eccle. 33.</note> that he goeth not ydle, for ydleneſſe brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth much euill. And agayne. Let no laborious <note place="margin">Eccle. 7.</note> worke be tedious vnto thee, neyther the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrye which the almightye God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. As the Byrds of the ayre are created to flie, <note place="margin">Iob. 5. Prou. 29.</note> ſo man is borne to labour. He that Tilleth his Land, ſhall haue plentiouſneſſe of bread, but he that followeth ydleneſſe, ſhall haue pouertie. Thou ſhalte eate the laboure of thy hands, <note place="margin">Pſal. 128.</note> ſayeth Dauid: O well is thee, and happy ſhalt thou be, wherefore be not weary in well doing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Puer.</speaker>
               <p>Although that theſe ſentences affyrm that labour is a thing neceſſary, I doe not denye it, for if a man eate or drinke, it is labour: if he goe abroad in the fields, it is labour: if he worke at any Science it is labour: al this I know.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ciuis.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, but there is further labour then that, there is a labour fyrſt to ſerue God, and remember howe much bounde thou arte vnto him for hys bountious and lyberall good giftes, whiche he doth beſtow on thee, thou muſt labour how to feare him, how to obay the Prince and her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
<pb facs="tcp:18315:9"/>
and beſydes I wil ſhew you ſomewhat what commeth of ydleneſſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Puer.</speaker>
               <p>I pray you let me here what ydleneſſe is, and the daunger thereof.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ciuis.</speaker>
               <p>I will mingle labour and ydle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe togyther, and as the Scripture alledgeth for them both, I will ſhew you.
