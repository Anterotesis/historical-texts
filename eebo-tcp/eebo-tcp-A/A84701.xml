         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>In his Childhood, the weakneſſe of his lower parts which made him unapt for exerciſes and feats of activity, rendred him more retired, and ſtudious, and more intent upon his Book then perhaps he had been otherwiſe.

For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown in years, and ſtate, he ſhook off his former retiredneſs, and betook himſelf to all manner of man-like exerciſes, as vaulting, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the great Horſe, running at the Ring, ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Croſs-bowes, Muskets, and great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, in which he became ſo expert, that he was ſaid to be the beſt Marks-man, and the moſt comely Manager of a great Horſe, of any one in his three Kingdoms. Nor were theſe excellencies <hi>ill-houſed,</hi> but his fair Soul was tenant to a lovely and well proportioned body.

Kings Speech, God at this time of his extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo looſed his tongue, that he delivered his thoughts without the leaſt ſtammering or hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation; enough to have convinced any but a <hi>Pilat,</hi> and a <hi>Jurie</hi> of <hi>Jewes,</hi> that by that mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle God ſeemed to ſay to them, in the language of that dumb man, <hi>Rex eſt, ne occide.</hi> But it was argument enough to them to cut off that head, that it wore three Ctowns. A thing ſo ſtrange and unheard of before our times, that though they made a <hi>Preſident,</hi> they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find an <hi>Example</hi> for it in all the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of the world. So ſacred and inviolable was the Perſon of the <hi>Prince</hi> amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> that when <hi>Nero</hi> (made valiant by his own fear) ran himſelf through, <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his Secretary, at his requeſt, helping to diſpatch him the ſooner, for that ſervice was afterwards put to death by <hi>Domitian,</hi> who thought it not meet to ſuffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man to live, who had in any ſort lent his hand to the death of a Prince.</p>
                  <p>The Kings of <hi>Peru</hi> were ſo reverenced by their ſubjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo faithfully ſerved, that never any of their ſubjects were found guilty of Treaſon. Indeed the people of <hi>Nicer a gua</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> had no law for the killer of a <hi>King,</hi> but it was for the ſame reaſon that <hi>Solon</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed none for a mans killing of his Father; both of them conceiting that men were not ſo unnatural, as to commit ſuch crimes. But ſuch is the miſerable condition of Princes, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Domitian</hi> complained, <hi>that they cannot be credited touching a Conſpiracy, plainly detected, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they be firſt ſlain.</hi> More ſtrange and ſad it is,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113670:18"/>
that men ſhould commit <hi>murther</hi> with the ſword of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>treaſon</hi> execute <hi>juſtice</hi> as a malefactor. Such actions ſeldome want their reward, and many times receive it from the Actors <hi>own</hi> hands.</p>

                  <p>At the Solemn Coronation of the Prince, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Peer</hi> of the Realm hath his ſtation about the Throne, and with the touch of his hand upon the Royal Crown, declareth the perſonal duty of that honour which he is called unto, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to hold on the Crown on the Head of his Soveraign, to make it the main end of his greatneſſe, to endeavour the eſtabliſhment of his Princes Throne.

Pardon my plainneſs, and think never the worſe of the Truth for my bad lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; Truth may many times have bad cloaths, yet has ſhe alwayes a good face. It is a good mark of the moral Philoſopher, that ſheep do not come to their ſhepherd, and ſhew him

how <hi>much they</hi> eat, but make it appear by the <hi>fleece</hi> that they wear on their backs, and the <hi>milk</hi> which they give. I will not wrong the ſharpneſs of your judgment by applying the Moral. I have read of two famous Painters, who, to ſhew their skill, the one drew a <hi>bunch of grapes</hi> ſo lively, that he cozened the <hi>Birds;</hi> the other drew a <hi>veil</hi> ſo perfectly over his <hi>grapes,</hi> that he deceiv'd the <hi>Artificer himſelf:</hi> Could we draw the colour of our good works never ſo lively, as to cozen every mortal eye, and draw ſo fine a <hi>veil</hi> over our <hi>evil deeds,</hi> as to conceit our ſelves into a conceit we had none, yet is there an All-ſeeing eye, to whom the darkeſt <hi>ſecret</hi> is moſt <hi>appar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, 'Tis my care not too much to indulge my body, as knowing that thoſe things the body inclines to moſt, are of the <hi>world,</hi> which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with <hi>God;</hi> and what the Spirit prompts to moſt, muſt needs be beſt, becauſe the <hi>Spirit is heavenly,</hi> and more of kin to the Deity. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtum ei vile eſt, cui corpus nimis charum eſt;</hi> ſaid one, that knew well what he ſaid: 'Tis not for nothing that our <hi>inward ſpirit</hi> is alwayes moſt <hi>ſad,</hi> when our <hi>outward man</hi> is moſt <hi>merry.</hi> In the ſecond place, 'Tis my deſie to avoid <hi>ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> becauſe, as 'tis ſaid of the Tyrant <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zantius, Corpora corporibus jungebat mortua vivis.</hi> In that the <hi>Living</hi> rather <hi>putrefied</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Dead,</hi> but the <hi>Dead</hi> did not <hi>revive</hi> by the <hi>Living.</hi> Such is the nature of man ſaith St. <hi>Gregory, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t quoties bonus malo conjungitur, non ex bono malus meliocriter, ſed ex malo bono contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netur.</hi>

It is a good caution therefore St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> gives (in his 48th.

Now, if this be the thing is meant, I thank God, I bear no man in the world the leaſt grudge or ſpight; therefore, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, I am no <hi>Malignant:</hi> But, if this be not their meaning, for my part, I doubt of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, whilſt they are ignorant of it themſelves.

                  <p>OF all pleaſures, reading is the beſt: of all readings, thoſe <hi>Antelucanas Lectiones</hi> are to me the moſt pleaſant and profitable. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is ſomething in it, that <hi>Lectus</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio</hi> are of near affinitie.

Weighing the arguments of both ſides, my reaſon holding the <hi>ballance</hi> with an equal hand, the arguments for the <hi>Traduction,</hi> in my eye ſeem to be moſt weightie. Perhaps becauſe I know not how to anſwer them. When I conſider the births of <hi>baſtards,</hi> and other ſuch
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:113670:139"/>
like irregular productions (the <hi>Anomalies</hi> of nature) I cannot (me thinks) ſalve Gods <hi>juſtice,</hi> who, if the ſoul be not <hi>ex traduce,</hi> muſt favour thoſe irregularities, ſo much againſt his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> And what hath the poor innocent ſoul done, to be impriſoned in a ſinful polluting bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die? For, if the ſoul be not <hi>propagated,</hi> then the <hi>bodies</hi> of Infants <hi>onely</hi> have ſinned, and are <hi>onely</hi> liable to the puniſhment of <hi>Original ſin.</hi> Now certainly, it cannot be properly ſaid that the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> ſinneth, for the bodie is but the <hi>ſouls</hi> inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what evil hath the ſoul of a young dying Infant committed, if his ſoul were not <hi>derived</hi> from <hi>Adam?</hi> And if the ſoul be <hi>infuſed,</hi> who doubts but that it comes <hi>pure and unſpotted</hi> from the hands of God? It was an errour rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned upon the ſcore of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> that our Saviour took onely <hi>fleſh</hi> of the Virgin, but not the <hi>ſoule:</hi> But it is the opinion of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that Chriſt took <hi>mans nature</hi> upon him in the Virgins womb; whence it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow, that he took <hi>both body and ſoul,</hi> ſince either, without the other, make not perfect man. Yet, if this be evaded, as extraordinary, in the Hiſtorie of the Creation, when God took <hi>Eve</hi> out of <hi>Adams</hi> ſide, it is not ſaid, that He <hi>breathed into her</hi> the breath of life, as before He did to <hi>Adam:</hi> Perhaps (and if ſilence may be interpreted conſent) to intimate that her <hi>ſoul</hi> was derived with her <hi>body</hi> from the man. But, that the ſoul, which Philoſophers call <hi>Anima,</hi> compoſed of the <hi>vegetative</hi> and <hi>ſenſitive</hi> facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is <hi>ex traduce,</hi> is yielded; the onely queſtion being about the <hi>Spiritus,</hi> which, they ſay, is the

breath of God, infuſed in the third, or four th' or ſixth moneth; or, to ſay truth, they know not when.

now I ſadly ſee, and ſigh to ſay, our <hi>Rents</hi> are like to prove our <hi>Ruine,</hi> and our <hi>diſtractions</hi> our <hi>deſtruction.</hi> I remember a Storie of a <hi>knaviſh Painter</hi> (ſo my Author calls him) who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make the Picture of ſome goddeſs for a Citie to worſhip, drew the <hi>Counterfeit</hi> of his own <hi>Miſtris,</hi> and ſo cauſed her to be <hi>courted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> that (perhaps) better deſerved to be <hi>carted.</hi> I wiſh this <hi>tale</hi> were not too <hi>true</hi> of our times. It is too obvious to conceal the <hi>Parallel.</hi> Do we not daily ſee <hi>Religion</hi> dreſt up in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſhapes of every ones fancie, and obtruded upon the eaſie multitude, as the onely Deitie for their adoration and obſervance? our <hi>faith</hi> made as changeable as our <hi>faſhions?</hi> And, what's the miſerie of our miſeries, none are ſo eaſily deluded, as the well-meaning, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-hearted, honeſt Chriſtians; who, out of an <hi>exceſſe</hi> of Charitie, are ready to believe all men mean truly, becauſe they doe ſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>If this be your caſe (and I am to ſeek if it be not) let me give you this Caution, Beware of that evil which commeth <hi>near</hi> to the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of good; none can ſo eaſily deceive you, as thoſe <hi>Hyaena's,</hi> who have learn'd your voice, to draw you out of the way. Take heed of thoſe ſerpents of the colour of the ground. Let St. <hi>Paul</hi> beſeech you to mark them which cauſe diviſions and offences: <hi>Contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which you have learned, and avoid them.</hi> I am miſ-inform'd, if the ſame word which we read <hi>Contrary,</hi> doth not alſo import <hi>near.</hi> There are no opinions ſo dangerouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:113670:145"/>
to the truth, as they that ſeem very near it.</p>
                  <p>Let me aſſure you, it is the <hi>old way,</hi> which is the <hi>good way,</hi> wherein you ſhall find <hi>reſt.</hi> There ſhall you find a direct road, without any turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and windings of private intereſt or facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: No briars and thorns of quarrelling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; no ſoul-deſtroying doctrines, under the oſtentious titles of ſoul-ſaving truths. It is no ſuch long and melancholy way, as we ſee now chalk'd out by thoſe who have found out new paths to heaven, that our Fathers never dream't of. There ſhall you find <hi>gravity</hi> without <hi>moro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and <hi>mirth</hi> without <hi>madneſs;</hi> Chriſtian cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe as well commanded, as commended. Religion is no ſuch frowning fury: <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> ar her daily practice, as well as <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>teares.</hi> The ſame Holy Spirit that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to <hi>pray alwayes,</hi> enjoyns us alſo to <hi>rejoyce evermore.</hi> We ſin, if we rejoyce not: There is not more errour in falſe mirth, than in unjuſt heavineſs. Can they be ſad, who have a <hi>God to defend,</hi> a <hi>Chriſt to ſave,</hi> and an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt to comfort them.</hi> It is for thoſe that know not God, or know him diſpleas'd, to droop, as men without hope.</p>
                  <p>An humble practice of thoſe <hi>Common truths,</hi> alone neceſſary to ſalvation, is far more ſafe, more happy, than all the towring and lofty ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of unquiet Heads, and too buſie Brains. There is ſome reaſon in the old Scotch Rithme.</p>

It was the ſaying of the D. of <hi>Rohan,</hi> a great <hi>Stateſ-man, That</hi> England <hi>was a mighty Animal, and could never die, unleſs it kill'd it ſelf.</hi> Certainly we have no worſe enemies than our ſelves, as if we had <hi>conſpired</hi> our own ruine: For <hi>Plutarch</hi> calls the ardent deſire of the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> to make <hi>Civil Wars</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> a <hi>Conſpiracie againſt themſelves.</hi> But well may the winds and waves be Pilots to that ſhip whoſe inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Mariners have thrown their Pylot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board. <hi>Dum ille regnabat, tranquillè vivebamus, &amp; neminem metuebamus,</hi> ſaid the people of the Emperour <hi>Pertinax.</hi> We remember the time when we lived in peace and plenty, till we ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited of our happineſs; and as our peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat plenty, ſo our plenty begat pride, and pride brought forth animoſities and factions, and they, if not prevented, will be delivered of our ruine and deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>In times paſt (ſayes <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> of our Countrymen) they lived under a <hi>Monarchy;</hi> now, that they are ſubject to divers Maſters, one can ſee nothing but faction and diviſions amongſt them. This was ſpoken of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers; and our Poſteritie will think it meant onely of us. The God of union re-unite us, and out of this <hi>Chaos</hi> of confuſion, create an happy concord amongſt us, before our rents prove our ruine, and our diſtractions our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.

                  <p>I Muſt tell you, you are not <hi>juſtly</hi> troubled at the <hi>injuſtice</hi> of our new Judges, ſince they have thereby rendred thoſe brave men <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> which otherwiſe had died as <hi>Criminals.

went to heaven, but the firſt man that went to heaven died a Martyr, ſuffered a violent death by the hands of a cruel and unmerciful <hi>brother.</hi> We have lived to ſee that politick prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Periander</hi> put in practice, who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with how to preſerve a <hi>tyranny,</hi> bid the meſſenger ſtand ſtill, whileſt he, walking in a garden, topt all the <hi>higheſt</hi> flowers, thereby ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the cutting off, and bringing low of the <hi>Nobility.</hi> Yet will not this do with us; it is but like <hi>Cadmus</hi> his ſowing of ſerpents teeth, which will raiſe up <hi>armed men</hi> to revenge the quarrel of thoſe brave ſpirits: For though our <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feu-bell</hi> hath been rung out, and the fire of our zeal rak'd up in the aſhes of <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> yet it is not extinguiſhed: Witneſs thoſe <hi>Sparks</hi> who have revenged the <hi>death</hi> of their Sovereign with the hazard of their own <hi>lives.</hi>
