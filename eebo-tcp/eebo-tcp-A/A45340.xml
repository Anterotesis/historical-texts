         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by the wisest of men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 23, and 25.
11. Yea, it is made one of Christs excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
that <hi>hee had the tongue of the Learned,
and knew how to speak a word in season.</hi> Isa. 50.
4. Such words are not onely profitable, but
also powerful, and carry abundance of convincing strength
and force with them, <hi>Iob</hi> 6. 25. This principally hath em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened
mee to dedicate this Treatise to you. Had I
searched for five verses thorow the whole Bible, I could
hardly have found five together (all things considered)
more suitable and seasonable for the present times wee live
in.</p>
            <p>In them wee have an Alarum for the Drowsie, a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasive
for the Impenitent, a Cordial for the Penitent, and
many quickening Considerations to move us all to a speedy
preparing to meet our God in a way of unfeigned Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before the Decree bring forth, and the fierce anger of
the Lord ceize upon us.</p>
            <p>Here wee may see <hi>Ephraims Dignity,</hi> and <hi>Ephraims Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96885:3"/>
and those sins which helpt to bring him down; and in
him wee may read <hi>Englands</hi> condition; the Lord hath made
us his <hi>Ephraim,</hi> hee hath laid his right hand upon us, hee
hath made us the head of the Tribes, hee hath set us above,
when for our sins hee might long since have laid us in the
dust. <hi>Ephraims</hi> sins were <hi>Ephraims</hi> ruine; and if those sins
bee found in <hi>England,</hi> which were found in him, what can
wee expect but the like judgements? for God is the same
to the same sinners. If <hi>Samaria</hi>'s sins bee found in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
London</hi> must look for <hi>Samaria</hi>'s judgements. God
will not spare sin, where ever hee findes it, bee it in City or
Country. Sin hath brought down greater Cities than yours;
as they had their times of rising, so of ruining; as of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
so of burning; witness <hi>Nineveh, No, Tyrus, Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
and <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> Sin hath made them all a desolation. For
my own particular, I shall never expect that City or State
should prosper, till Gods Church prosper; or that our houses
should continue, when Gods house lies waste; all our build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
will bee but <hi>Nods</hi> and <hi>Babels,</hi> that is, unsettlement
and confusion, till Gods house bee setled and exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, <hi>Hag. 1. 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, &amp;c.</hi> It is the sins of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that I fear more than all the enemies in the world. It
is not <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> it is not <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Turkey</hi> that I fear;
though all Nations should compass us about, yet were wee
but an obedient people, I should not doubt, but that in the
Name of the Lord wee should destroy them. But it is the
Atheism, Heresie, Blasphemy, Security, Impenitency, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy,
Prophanation of holy things, Formality, Hypocrisie,
Unrighteousness, Division, Witchcraft, and contempt of
the Gospel. These, even these, are the enemies that I fear;
and if any thing destroy us, it is these abominations that
reign amongst us. <hi>Bee instructed therefore, O England, and
thou, O London, the chief City thereof, lest the Lords soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

God hath bornelong with our provocations, but hee will
not alwaies bear, but will at last reconcile his patience
with the fierceness of his fury. Let not therefore Satan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
any, as if these were but some melancholy conceits,

            <p>It is true, wee have many Priviledges that others want,
but no Priviledges can preserve an impenitent people
from ruine; <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was highly priviledged; and had
the choicest Preaching a little before its downfall. The
sins of a City and Nation may bee so great, that though
<hi>Noah, Iob</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> (three men that could do very
much with God, <hi>Ezek. 14. 14.)</hi> Should stand before the
Lord for them, yet they shall not prevail for a hardened,
Apostatizing people; where such spiritual judgements go
before, there temporal judgements alwaies follow, <hi>Isa. 6.
9, 10, 11, 12. Sinning is worse than suffering;</hi> better see a
people bleeding, than blaspheming; for by our Sufferings
God is glorified, but by our sinns hee is dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Wee are a people that are much for <hi>Liberty;</hi> wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure a yoak, no, though it bee Christs easie yoak,
yet wee will not have him to reign over us; wee will not serve
him with gladness, and singleness of heart in the abundance
of all things; and therefore hee may justly make us serve
our enemies in the want of all things, <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 28. 47,

proclaim a Liberty for us to the Sword, Pestilence and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,

            <p>God hath <hi>humbled</hi> many in your great City, by sickness,
poverty, and decay of Trading, &amp;c. But have you been made
<hi>humble</hi> thereby? Hee hath sent the choicest of his Ministers
amongst you, and fed you (in a spiritual sense) with the
finest of the Wheat, but have you answered Gods cost and
care? and are you bettered by all his dispensations to you?
Have you heard the voice of the Rod, and who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
it? or have you not rather fallen away more and
more, and grown worse and worse? if so, how can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
peace, when your Apostasies, witchcrafts, and spiritual
fornications are so many? 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 17, 18.</p>

Commentary was defective, and that Mr.

died before hee had finisht the Chapter;
whereupon I perused the remainder of the Chapter, and
finding it to bee very pat and pertinent to these present

had set upon it this twelve years (for so long hath Mr.

Their sins had turned God their great Benefactour
into a Lyon, a Leopard, a Bear; and imbittered his soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. They dreamt they should finde him a God all
of mercy, he tells them they are mistaken; for now they
should finde him a God full of fury.</p>
            <p>3. Whereas they might think to escape because God had
so long forborne them; the Prophet by a Prolepsis prevents
this conceit, <hi>Ver. 12, 13. The iniquity of Ephraim is bound
up, and his sin is hid,</hi> q. d. <hi>Ephraim</hi> thinks now he may take
his pleasure since his iniquity lyes hid, and he hath so long
escaped; but mark what follows, <hi>ver. 13. The sorrows of a
travelling woman shall come upon him.</hi> As the pleasure of
conception hath the pangs of child-birth attending it; so this
secure and pleasant people shall certainly meet with sorrow
in the end, and therefore <hi>Ephraim</hi> is but an unwise son, and
guilty of great folly, in that he doth not speedily make his
peace with God.</p>
            <p>4. Lest they should be despondent and despair, he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixeth

            <p>In this twelfth Verse we have briefly set forth the desperate

               </note> they were come to
that height of wickedness, and grown so stupid under Gods
stroaks, that now they must expect no more pardon, nor look
that God should bear any longer with them. So that in these
words the Lord meets with the vain conceits of the loose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of those times, who soothed up themselves in their evil
wayes, and because the Lord suspended his judgements for a
time, therefore they never suspected them, but thought that
the Lord was such a one as themselves, that is, no way dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with their sins, but since he connived at them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96885:6"/>
they conclude he slept, &amp; took no notice of them, but had
utterly forgot them. But they are much deceived, saith the
Lord, for I have seen all their wickedness, and have sealed up
all their sins till the due time of revealing them (which is now
at hand) be come. 'Tis true, I have borne long with them
(let that offend none) for I have not forgot their provocations,
they are all bound and bundled up so that not one of them
shall be lost, but they shall dearly reckon for them all together.
As God hath a book of remembrance wherein he records the
good deeds of his people, which shall one day be publisht to
their everlasting praise, (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16.) So he hath a book of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
wherein he records the wickedness of the wicked,
which shall ere long be publisht to their everlasting shame.
As the sin of <hi>Iudah</hi> was written with a pen of iron, and an
adamantine claw, so that it should not easily be blotted out,
(<hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 1.) So all the sins of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> from the time of
<hi>Ieroboams</hi> reign, to their going into captivity, were bound up
and sealed, that they might not be lost. Papers that lye loose
and unbound are scattered with every wind, but when they
are fast bound up and sealed, then they are safe and sure.
Mony that lyes at random is lost, but that which is lockt up in
Coffers is safe, and will be brought forth when need requires.
So God had not forgot <hi>Ephraims</hi> sin, but had hid and sealed
it up till the determined time to punish him was come, and
lockt them up in his memory for a day of reckoning.</p>

            <p>Such pangs the Scripture oft makes the emblems of extream
anguish and distress, <hi>Psal: 48. 6. Esay</hi> 26. 17, 18. and 37. 3.
<hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 28. and 22. 23. and 49. 24. <hi>Micai 4. 9, 10. Gal.</hi>
4. 19. So the calamities which were coming upon this people,
were not slight sorrows, but such as brought desolation with
them. 2. The longer a dead birth is concealed and carried
in the womb, the more dangerous and difficult is the travel:
<hi>Ephraim</hi> had for a long time concealed his sin, and therefore
now his pangs are like to be so much the more grievous.
3. If the birth be living, the greater the birth, and the longer
they go with it, the sharper are the pangs: so the longer God
bears with a people, and the more his Patience is a bused, the
more terrible will his wrath be.</p>
            <p>3. Inevitable and irresistible. There's no escaping when
once the time of travelling is come. <hi>Cum adest hora, non da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur

peace with God, that hee might by his mercy bee delivered fully
from those miserable straights where in hoe is: if there were but one
drop of true wisdom in him, yea if hee were not utterly stupified,

in his sins, that hee rests content with his carnal condition, never
once striving or desiring to come out of this darkness into light,
or to be brought from under the power of Satan unto God.</p>
            <p>So that in these words the Prophet doth notably inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the stupidity and folly of Gods people, in that they had
rather stick and bee stifled in the filth of their sins, lye in the
mouth of death, and under the pressures of Gods wrath, to

the world of sin,</hi> John 16. 8. A man must
by the Law bee convinc'd of his misery, before
ever hee will beg for mercy: and though all
are not converted, who are convinced, yet all
are convinced who are converted. Men will
not come to Christ till they see no other remedy. The Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
cries not for a Psalm of mercy, till hee bee cast. The

               <p>This then is the first and great work of the Spirit, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
men throughly of their lost and undone condition. This
is virtually and fundamentally all; till this bee done, no good
can bee done; wee shall never bee truly humbled, nor prize
a Saviour, nor bee fit for his service, nor bee intrusted by him.
Men must bee convinced in themselves, what they are in
themselves, before Christ will reveal himself unto them. Christ
will not powre the oyl of mercy, but into broken hearts; nor
bee a Physitian to any, till they bee sick of sin. Such will bee
ductible and tractable to his will. <hi>Paul</hi> when unhorsed and
humbled to the ground, then is ready to do whatever Christ
commands him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 6</p>
               <p>Naturally, men have covers, false colours, cavils and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
for sin; but when the Spirit comes with convincing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
it stops their mouths, and puts them to silence, so that
they have nothing to say for themselves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. they
see themselves to bee guilty, and such as cannot plead their
own cause without an Advocate. Whil'st men are in their
natural condition, they are full of self-righteousness, and
filled with false notions. Like spiders, we are full of poyson,
and yet not sick of it, because 'tis their nature. But when
the Spirit comes, it undeceives men, it rectifies their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and confutes those vain conceits which before had
possest them. It now clearly convinceth them of the vanity
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96885:14"/>
of the creature, of the hatefulness of sin, and the necessity of
a Saviour. Conviction, is a clear and infallible demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which takes away all a mans shifts, and doth so non-plus a
man, that hee hath nothing to say for himself. When Christ
had confuted the Pharisees (<hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 22.) hee took their
cloaks from them: now I have spoken to them, they have no
cloak for their sins. Every natural man hath some cloak and
cover for his sin; but when the Spirit comes, carnal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are confuted, and the devils strong holds are battered,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. now hee confesseth hee's poor and naked,

of some dreadful judgement upon a person or nation.</p>
               <p>Many love to hear of Priviledges, but nor of Duties; of
Salvation, but not of Sanctification; of Heaven, but not of

                  </gap>her. Like the
<hi>Israelites</hi> that liked well of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but they would not go
thorow a wilderness to it. But a gratious soul is thankful for
humiliation, as well as for consolation, and blesseth God,
when by his Word and Spirit he convinceth him of his misery,
that so hee may bee fit for mercy. The sinner convinced of
sin, is nearer heaven than the best natural man in the world
Publicans and Harlots, that have no excuse nor Apology for
their gross sins, are in a more hopeful way of cure, than Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
that think themselves righteous enough; <hi>Better</hi> (saith
Austin) bee an humble sinner, than a proud innocent.</p>
               <p>2. Take heed of <hi>Ignorance and Unbelief,</hi> which are two
great hindrances of conviction. When men know not their
misery, nor yet beleeve the curses which yet are due to them,
no wonder if such be unwrought upon.</p>
               <p>3. Take heed of <hi>quenching the motions of the Spirit</hi> in you,
for if ever you be convinced, 'tis the Spirit must do it, <hi>Iohn
16.</hi> 8. all the men and Ministers in the world cannot do it
without the Spirit. We may tell you long enough of this and
that sin which you have done, and all to no purpose, till the
Spirit sets in with the work, and make you sensible of sin, then,
and never till then it becomes effectual. Mark therefore
when the Spirit moves in thee, and improve those opportunities
for thy souls advantage. For as when children are come to
the natural birth, 'tis God that must and can give strength to
bring forth; so much more in this supernatural birth, is his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
assistance requisite.</p>
               <p>Oh then follow on convictions till they come to conversion,
bee no longer unwise children, that stick in the place of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth. Bee not almost, but altogether Christians. Rest
not content with a name of living, but live indeed. Beseech the
Lord to bring thy soul out of this prison, tell him that Christ
hath proclaimed liberty to captives, and thou art one; thou
hast been long in captivity to sin and Satan, beseech him now
at last to free thee, and thy soul shall praise him. Bee earnest,
let God see that thy desires are real, and then he that hath
brought to the birth, will give strength to bring forth.</p>
               <p>Lastly, consider if a man may attain conviction, and yet
miss of conversion and salvation, what will become of those
that were never yet convinc'd of their sin, nor had so much as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96885:15"/>
the faith of devils to beleeve and tremble? if <hi>Iehu</hi> that was
zealous for God, and <hi>Ahab</hi> that humbled himself, and <hi>Iudas</hi>
that lived unblameably, and the <hi>Pharisees</hi> that prayed and
fasted, and <hi>Herod</hi> that reformed many things, and <hi>Ananias</hi>
and <hi>Saphira</hi> that gave their goods to pious uses; if all these
came short of heaven; where, oh where will thousands amongst
us appear, that come short of those who come short of heaven?
Rest not then in thy dead and formal condition, but get a
sound and thorow conversion.</p>
               <p>To quicken you, consider, 1. In so doing you will bee <hi>wise
children.</hi> Naturally wee all desire to bee accounted wise, the
title of fool is odious to us, but wee are never wise indeed,
till convictions go on to a thorow conversion. The Prodigal
when hee returned, then and not till then did hee come to
himself, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 17.</p>
               <p>2. You shall have <hi>Gods Spirit to assist you;</hi> the work indeed
is hard, but such assistance will make it easie. The Spirit of
God loves to bee employed in such noble work, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of sin, and the exalting of Christ in the soul. Hee is
the Spirit of comfort and Peace, but he layes the foundation
of it, in convincing us of our sin and misery.</p>
               <p>3. 'Twill make you <hi>profit more by Sermons, Sacraments, Prayer,
&amp;c.</hi> When the soul is thus plowed up with a sense of sin, then
'tis a fit soyl to sow the seed of Gods Word in.</p>
               <p>4. This will <hi>prevent abundance of sorrow. If Ephraim</hi> had
not stuck so long in the place of bringing forth, it had been
better with him, and hee had prevented those desolations that
after ceized upon him.</p>
               <p>5. By coming off fully to Christ, you will enjoy abundance
of Peace and comfort, which otherwise you will miss of. A
thorow conversion brings joy, as a woman that is once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of her birth, forgetteth her sorrow for joy that a childe
is born into the world. <hi>The wise Merchant</hi> that sold all, and

made a wise bargain. The Spirit layes the foundation of
comfort, first, in convincing men of their sin and misery, and
then of an all-sufficient righteousness to free them from that
misery, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 8, 9.</p>

so as to make a right use of it, and to repent, (Hos. 7. 9.) but
still we remain incorrigible and incurable, growing worse for
beating. The more pains God takes to cure us, the more we
revolt both in doctrine and manners; and therefore since in
our filthiness there is leudness and wee will not be purged, wee

folly and stupidity. Ephraim</hi> is a son, though an unwise son.
The ten Tribes under <hi>Ieroboam, Ahab</hi> and the rest of those
wicked Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> were sadly over-grown with Idolatry,
Security, Impenitency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet God owns them for his
people to the last, and their circumcision as valid still. <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
that killed the Prophets, yet were owned by Christ for the
Church of God; and hee preacht unto them, even when hee
wept over them for their sins, and for the fore-seen calamities
which were coming on them. The Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> what
carnality, divisions, drunkenness and profanation of holy
things were amongst them? and yet still stiled the Church of
God. Great then is the uncharitableness of those people, that
cast off Churches and people, whom God hath not cast off; and
unchurch those, whom God hath not unchurched. The bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Prodigal was angry at his Fathers kinde reception

O grave I will be thy destruction, Repentance shall be

            <p>THis Verse is a kinde of Parenthesis, and being taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
in it self, the context will run more smoothly.
'Tis full of knots and difficulties, it hath almost as many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations,
as there be Interpreters, and as many various
Lections, as words.</p>
            <p>Some read the words conditionally, and put in the word, if,
and put the Verb in a different Mood and Tense, thus, <hi>if
Ephraim</hi> were wise and <hi>Would</hi> but repent, <hi>I would</hi> have ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed
him from death, <hi>I would</hi> have redeemed him from the
power of the grave, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) I would either have preserved him
from captivity, or else I would have delivered him thence.
This is true, but not from the Text, for the word is <hi>Ephdem</hi> in
the future Tense, <hi>liberabo,</hi> I will ransom, I will redeem: and
wee may not change Mood and Tense to make a sense of our
own, though never so good. The words therefore are to bee
taken simply in themselves for a singular support to Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in their deepest distresses; as containing in them a preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cordial, and a most comfortable Evangelical promise, of
a mighty Redemption and glorious Resurrection to the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
according to the election of grace, whom God would
have comforted in times of distress. 'Tis usual with the Prophets
to intermingle comforts with their threatnings) to keep Gods
people from despaire. (So <hi>Hos.</hi> 1. and 2. and 11. <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 8
to 15.) Before he had threatned destruction to the wicked, now
he comforts the Penitent.</p>

in all these, for Christ hath Redeemed us from them all, and
triumphed over them on the Cross, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
            <p>2. Here is a Promise of their Redemption from this their
misery, <hi>I will ransom them from the power of the grave.</hi> What
is that? why exegetically 'tis added, <hi>I will redeem them from
death,</hi> (i. e.) I will bring my Elect out of their captivity,
where they lay for dead as 'twere; and this deliverance
shall bee to them a pledge of their Resurrection to eternal
life.</p>
            <p>3. Here is the manner how this shall bee done, set forth by
a Prosopopeical Apostrophe to death and the grave, whom he
brings in as some living enemy, and therefore calls to him,
saying; <hi>O death I will bee thy death, O grave I will bee thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi>
q. d. O death, thou seemest to be mighty and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but I will disarm thee of it all; I will not only bite thee,
but destroy thee; 'tis not <hi>morsus</hi> (as the Vulgar) but <hi>exitium,</hi>
an utter destruction of these enemies of our salvation.</p>
            <p>4. Here is the certainty of this deliverance, drawn from the
constancy of God in keeping his Promise, and from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability
of his decree. <hi>Repentance shall be hid from mine eyes,</hi>
q. d. I will never repent of the mercy which I have promised
them, but my goodness to them shall be firm and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
This sense suits best with the Original and with the
context, wherein God promiseth a choice mercy to his people.
The Vulgar and the seventy render it,<note place="margin">Notham, paeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo consolatio.</note> 
               <hi>consolation is hid from
mine eyes:</hi> 'tis true, the word in the Original signifies conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
as well as repentance; but to render it as a threatning
here, as if God should say, I am fully determined to destroy
my people, for consolation is hid from mine eyes; This is very
improper here, for it confounds the context, and the scope of
the Verse, which is to comfort, and not to disquiet Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
In it the Prophet, the better to strengthen the faith of
Gods people, doth highly extol Gods Almighty power; for
when wee are in straights, wee are very apt to question that,
<hi>(Num. 11. 13, 21, 22, 23. Psal. 78. 19.)</hi> To an eye of sense,
Gods people lying in captiviy, were as dead men, and past all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96885:18"/>
hope of recovery; I but saith the Prophet, though ye were
dead, yet God can raise you again, for hee's Lord of death
and hell, and hath a sovereign power over them all; though
death conquers all, yet hee conquers death; though it be
mighty, yet God is Almighty, and there's nothing too hard for
him; he will be the death of death, and if none will redeem
you thence, yet he will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> The Question is, of what Redemption and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
doth the Prophet here speak, whether of a corporal or
spiritual Redemption?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Of both. 1. Literally the Lord promiseth to free
his Elect and penitent people from the grave of their capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.
Banisht men are counted as dead men, especially in
a civil sense, and the place of their banishment is as the grave.
Now many of the remainders of <hi>Israel,</hi> after the destruction
of their Kingdom, joyned themselves to the Jews, and with
them came out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Though for their Idolatry and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
hee threatned perpetual banishment to them, yet
for the comfort of his people that then were, and after should
arise, hee promiseth a Redemption for them, (Hos. 1. 10.)
which was fulfilled about two hundred years after that <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
was taken, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> proclaimed liberty to the Jews to
go build the Temple, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>2. Typically it alludes to our Spiritual and eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
by Christ, and our conquest over death and hell by
him. By <hi>Adams</hi> sin, death came upon all men (Rom. 512.) but
Christ by his Resurrection hath freed us from the power of death
and hath led it captive, which formerly led us captive, Ps. 68. 18.
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. This is the Redemption (saith <hi>Zanchy</hi>) which is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
and properly here meant: for though the people of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
after seventy years captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> did return again out
of it; yet the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> after that <hi>Samaria</hi> was taken,
never returned again to their own land, for it was laid waste,
and inhabited by strangers. 'Tis usual with the Prophets, to
use such Metabases, sudden digressions and passings from their
history, to Christ, who was their scope, delight and love; so
that every hint and shadow in the Old Testament, brought
him to their remembrance: and then from Christ, they fell
to the continuance of their history again. Thus 'tis here; and

Or as the Apostle from the Septuagint (though in this Text,
the Apostle in some things varies from the present Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint,
and so do the allegations in the New Testament; which
shews the folly of those, who do equalize it with the Original
Hebrew) O death where is thy sting, O grave where is thy
victory? The first <hi>Adam</hi> brought death into the world, but
the second <hi>Adam</hi> hath abolish'd it.</p>
            <p>There is some difficulty in the words, and therefore I shall

<hi>(Mat.</hi> 21. 13. alludes to <hi>Esay</hi> 56. 7. and <hi>Ier. 7. 11.)</hi> So here
the Apostle cites one text out of Esay 25. 8. <hi>he will swallow up
death in Victory.</hi> The other is <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 13. The seventy ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it thus; <hi>devorabit mors praevalens.</hi> Death devours all, but
this is contrary both to the sense of the Prophet and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
who speak not of the prevailing power of death, but of
the power of Christ over death. Death is swallowed up in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96885:20"/>
Victory, and that great devourer of all, is by Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured.
This promile is now fulfilled in the death of Christ,
who hath already destroyed the power of death for his
people; and shall bee compleatly fulfilled at the Resurrection
of the dead, when all corruption and mortality shall bee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
taken away, and death shall bee swallowed up in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
for ever. In the sense of this mercy the Apostle breaks
forth ravished as it were with the contemplation of this
conquest over death, into a triumphant song, which all the
Saints shall sing at the last day; when they shall bee totally
freed from the captivity of death and the grave, then shall
they insult over subdued death, and say, <hi>O death where is thy
sting,</hi> wherewith thou hadst wont to wound all creatures? <hi>O
grave where is thy victory,</hi> by which thou hast hitherto kept the
dead under by force, which now thou must render again, as
not being able any longer to hold them under thy power?
<hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 13, 14. It is onely sin by which death hath power
over us; and it is the just rigor of the Law which inflicts death
upon us for sin. But thanks bee to God who hath given us
the victory over sin, which is the cause of death, and over
death which is inflicted for sin, through Jesus Christ our
Lord, by whom wee obtain an immortal and incorruptible
life. Thus the Apostle hath faithfully given us the sense of the
Prophet, though not his very words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The summe and substance of all is this,</hi> Though <hi>Ephraim</hi>
hath been an unwise Son, and hath delayed his returning unto

my faithfulness and truth unto my people, I will never repent of

with <hi>I Cor. 2. 9. And hath not entred into the heart of man:</hi>
These words are added by way of illustration by the Apostle.
So <hi>Isa. 22. 13. Let us eat and drink, for to morrow wee shall dye.</hi>
But the Apostle puts it in the present tense, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 32. To

children are confederates, and in Covenant with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,

and that Infant-baptism now, is as lawful as Infant-circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision

read it in so many letters, Thou shalt baptise Infants. So the

               <p>4 Obs. <hi>There is an holy harmony, and sweet consent in the
Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no repugnancy, no real contradiction there. Like
stones in an Arch, they mutually uphold, and strengthen each
other. The Doctrine of the Prophets gives light to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and the Apostles again illustrate and explain them. In
both there is one, and the same Spirit of truth, who at sundry
times, and in sundry manners, hath published one and the
same truth to his people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2. They must not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bee opposed, but composed; Not made to contradict, but
to confirm each other, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 44.</p>
               <p>5 Obs. <hi>Gods people, whilest they are in this world, may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
deep distress and misery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They may bee brought so low, that to a carnal eye they
may seem dead and buried, past hope and help, not onely in
their own eyes, but also in the eyes of others. Wee have a
notable instance for this, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 1. to 15. the desperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Gods people in their Babylonish captivity, is there
set forth, by dead, dried bones, to an eye of sense past all
hope or possibility of recovery; in so much, that Gods own
people whose faith should not fail, cry out, vers. 11. <hi>Our bones
are dried, our hope is lost, and wee are cut off.</hi> Yea the Prophet
himself staggered, and was non-plust, verse 3. the Lord asked
him, <hi>Son of man, can these bones live?</hi> Is it possible that ever
such dry bones should live again? The Prophet answers, <hi>Lord
thou knowest,</hi> q. d. it passeth my apprehension to conceive
how this should bee; I know not how it should bee effected,
but Lord thou knowest what thou hast to do, and to thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96885:22"/>
thing is impossible. This the Lord doth in his wisdome, to out
us of our selves, and all creature-confidences; that in an holy
desperation wee may say with repenting <hi>Israel, Ashur shall
Not save us, neither will wee ride upon horses, nor say any more to
the work of our hands, Yee are our gods, for with thee the fatherless
finde mercy,</hi> Hos. 14. 3.</p>
               <p>6 <hi>Obs.</hi> God in his due time will deliver his people out of the
deepest distress.</p>
               <p>Hee is Omnipotent, hee can, and will redeem <hi>Israel,</hi> not
out of one or two, but out of all his troubles, <hi>Psal. 25. ult.</hi>
Art thou weak? Hee can strengthen thee. Art thou sick? Hee
can heal thee. Art thou dark? Hee can insighten thee. Art
thou dead? Hee can inliven thee. Hast thou lain in thy grave
till thou stinkest again? so did <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Hast thou lain till
thou art rotten? so did <hi>Israel</hi> in their Babylonish Captivity,
and yet were restored, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 11, 12. So in desertions wee
are apt to bee despondent, when wee walk in darkness, and
can see no light, neither Sun-light, nor Moon-light, neither
Star-light, nor Candle-light, but are like unto dry bones in a
Sepulchre, without life, without spirit, without strength, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
comfort, and see no way of deliverance. Aye, but now
is a time to live by faith, and not by sense, <hi>Isa. 40. 27, 28, 29,
30,</hi> 31, and 50. 10. Such is our weakness, that wee are apt to
limit the holy one of <hi>Israel,</hi> and to think that hee can help us
in lesser trials, and bring us out of petty crosses, but when
some <hi>fluctus decumanus,</hi> some great waves of Tentation come,
then wee are apt to question Gods power and promises, and
to say with <hi>David, I shall one day perish by the hand of Saul,</hi>
1 Sam. 27. 1. Wee are apt to say with <hi>Martha,</hi> If Christ had
come a little sooner, hee might have raised <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but now
(saith she) he stinks, and is past help, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 39. Aye but it is
the better for that, for now Christs power will bee the more
manifested, and his Father the more glorified. The more
grievous thy disease, the greater will the praise of thy Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
bee in thy cure, and wee shall love much, when wee see
how much is forgiven; and therefore <hi>David</hi> makes it an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to move the Lord to pitty him, because his sins were
great, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25 11. Remember, it is Gods usual course to let
men bee dead and buried (as it were) in misery, and to bring
things to extremity, and then appear; <hi>Gen. 22. 14. Psal.</hi> 461.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96885:22"/>
when trouble comes, then hee comes too. Wee read of three

if some had not medled with it.</p>
            <p>1 Some make the words a promise of great blessings to
<hi>Ephraim</hi> after all his sorrows, <hi>Yet hee shall bee fruitful amongst

yet by the might of him that ransometh men from the
grave, they shall bee raised up. But this is a forcing of the
words contrary to their genuine sense and meaning.</p>
            <p>2 Others apply it to Christ, and say, Hee shall increase and

multiply his Elect both in number and glory at the last day.<note place="margin">Qui ad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The very rehearsal of this is confutation sufficient.</p>
            <p>3 The Vulgar Latine, leaving the Hebrew to follow the
Septuagint, read it, <hi>Ephraim dividet, Ephraim</hi> shall divide
amongst his brethren, and make a schism amongst them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God will send the <hi>Assyrian</hi> against him. But the word is
<hi>Iaphri, crescet,</hi> not <hi>Iaphti, dividet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 <hi>Lyra hic delirat,</hi> when hee takes, or rather mistakes the
word for a division and separation at the end of the world,
when the evill shall bee separated from the good, and the
Goats from the Sheep. Quite contrary to the scope of the
Text, which speaks of increasing, not of dividing; and of
Brethren, which Sheep and Goats were never yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted.</p>
            <p>In the words wee have <hi>Ephraims</hi> Dignity, and <hi>Ephraims</hi>
Downfal; or Gods Mercy, and <hi>Ephraims</hi> Misery.</p>
            <p>1 Here is <hi>Ephraims</hi> Dignity, Hee was fruitful amongst

the fruitfulness of the earth, and the fruitfulness of the

the blessing, which <hi>Iacob</hi> his Grand-father gave him on his

but what pleaseth God should please us, wee should quiet our
selves in such dispensations as our Saviour did, <hi>Matth. 11.
25, 26. Even so O Father, because it pleaseth thee.</hi> q. d. since
it is thy good pleasure to hide the mysteries of salvation
from the wise men of the world, and to reveal them to simple
men and women, it pleaseth mee well, because it is thy good
pleasure so to have it. Wee are apt to confine Gods grace to
the order of nature, and external accomplishments. Amongst
all the sons of <hi>Iesse,</hi> even <hi>Samuel</hi> the Seer would not have

<hi>Abinadab,</hi> the proper persons, great Souldiers, and prime

spiritual grace and choice. Hee is wiser than the wisest, and
often chuseth where man leaves, and leaves where man

of his Prophets,</hi> Hos. 12. 10. This is an excellent way of preaching,

Plain preaching is the best teaching, it is the best way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
and convert men; and if plain familiar preaching will
not work, certainly, dark, mysterious preaching will never do
it. Hence Christ tells <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that if when hee had spoken
of earthly things they beleeved not, how will they beleeve
when hee shall speak to them of heavenly things? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 12.
This made <hi>Paul,</hi> that he had rather speak five words in a known
tongue to edifie others, than ten thousand in an unknown

indeed. Hee hath made us as hee did <hi>Ephraim</hi> here, the head
of the Nations, when for our sins, wee might have been the

hideous Blasphemies, hee might justly have have laid us beneath.
Hee hath made us the terrour of the Nations, and given us

               <p>All these things make us deeply indebted to our God; but
had wee ten thousand times more Priviledges than wee have,
yet if wee walk not up unto them, and answer them with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
wee are an undone people. The greater our Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
the nearer to Judgement, if wee abuse them. <hi>Shiloh</hi>

it hath done of late, and proceed in its Hypocrise, Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

and abuse of Gods favours, &amp;c. wee must certainly expect
some sweeping judgement. It is not Priviledges, it is not

Prerogatives, that make us acceptable to God, but a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

Let us then become an holy people, and wee shall bee an

hearts and lives, that as God hath done more for us,
than for others, so wee may do more for him than others;
that as hee hath given us distinguishing mercies, so wee may
answer them with distinguishing manners, not living like the

and State; Hee hath broken the power and policy of many
subtil <hi>Achitophels</hi> and great <hi>Zanzummims,</hi> Giants, and sons of
<hi>Anak.</hi> Hee hath made Mountains a plain before us; and
though fierce men have rid over our heads, yet hath hee
brought us through fire and water into a wealthy place. For
<hi>Englands</hi> sake hee hath sent to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and brought down all
their Nobles: Hee hath bound even Kings and Princes in
chains, and their followers in links of iron. Hee hath made
the wicked to bow before the good, and the evil at the gates
of the righteous. No Nation so blessed of our God as wee,
and no Nation that hath worse requited the Lords blessings than
wee have done. As hee hath loaded us with mercies, so wee
have loaded him with Blasphemies, Heresies, Apostasies; no
favours can win us, no benefits binde us; if God had been our
deadly enemy, wee could not have acted more ignobly and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuously
against him than wee have done. It is a Miracle
of mercy that hee yet continues his mercies to us, and that
he hath not long ago stripped us naked, as in the day when wee
were born, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 3. Wee have rendred evil to the Lord for
all his goodness to us; and therefore wee may justly fear that
evil should pursue us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 13. if hee shall bee punished
that renders evil for evil to man, what shall bee done to him
that renders evil for good, and that to his God who never did
him hurt? The good Lord humble us for all our ungrateful
and dis-ingenuous walking before him, who hath been so good
and gracious to us; and grant, that at last wee may know and
acknowledge the God of our mercies, lest an East-wind come
and bereave us of all; for though at present wee have peace
and plenty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fresh springs of mercy round about us, yet
God can suddenly dry up all our springs, and bring a plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring

will have done, <hi>Gen. 20. 6. Iob</hi> 1. 12.</p>

               <p>1 This may fear us, since in war wee have not to do with

when God pursues, <hi>Ier. 11. 11. The wind of the Lord will
peirce into the most secret places, and finde out you, and all your
hid treasures,</hi> Psal. 21. 8. and 139. 7, 8, and <hi>Isa. 13. 16, 17. Amos

treasures, <hi>Isa.</hi> 10. 13, 14. and 45. 3. <hi>Obad.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Let us then wean our hearts from those flying,<note place="margin">See the Vanity of the creature in my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on 2 Tim. 3. 2. p. 38.</note> fading,
transitory things. What the Prophet said of riches, <hi>If they
increase, set not your hearts upon them;</hi> may bee fitly applied to
all creature comforts, if friends increase, set not your hearts
upon them; if children increase, or honours, or armies, or
pleasant habitations, &amp;c. yet set not your hearts upon them,
but look upon them as things that have wings to flye from us
in our greatest need. Lye loose therefore in your affections
to all earthly enjoyments, that so when ever the Lord shall
call for them by fire, sword, or any other way, it may not
trouble you to part with them; make not Idols of them in
over-loving them, lest you lose them. It is great folly gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to lay up treasures for wee know not who, <hi>Psal. 39. 9. Ier.
17.</hi> 11. it may bee for an enemy, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> here; little did
hee think that the merciless <hi>Assyrian</hi> should bee inriched with
his labour, and that the men whom their souls hated
should bee masters of all their desireable and pleasant
things.</p>
               <p>2 Since earthly things are so uncertain and fading, <hi>Lay not
up for your selves treasures on earth, where moths corrupt, and
theeves break thorow and steal, but lay up for your selves trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
in heaven,</hi> Matth. 6. 20, 21. Lay out your estates for
God,<note place="margin">See more fully in <hi>Trapp</hi> on Mat. 6. 19, 10.</note> his truth, his cause, his people, and the spiritual good
of you, and yours. This is to lay up treasures in heaven. Get
grace, that is durable riches which will never leave you,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96885:35"/>
and that better part which shall never bee taken from
you.</p>

So that the Prophet doth not here begin any new Sermon, but
onely confirms what hee had spoken before of the destruction
of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the overthrow of the whole Kingdome. So
that the words are a clear exposition of the former similies,

it is sin. To see every base lust preferred before him, to see
Satan in the Throne, the heart, and the Spirit of God kept
out, must needs imbitter his Spirit against us. The Lord that

               <p>2 It is a spiritual bitterness, now wicked men have no

               <p>3 The Devil that Prince of darkness, keeps wicked men in
darkness and ignorance, so that they know not the terrours of
the Lord, nor what a fearful thing it is to fall into the hands
of an angry God, and this makes men so fearless of sin. As
wee cannot desire what we know not <hi>(nihil volitum nisi prius
cognitum)</hi> so wee cannot fear it. A childe that knows not
what a terrible thing a Lion or a Bear is, will venture to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
them; but a man of understanding will run from them.
It is fools who make a mock of sin, who never knew the

spectacles, and then no wonder if they call Drunkenness,

for Christ; when Christ sees of the travel of his soul in our
souls, it delights him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 10, 11. This sense of sin argues
some spiritual life in the soul. Nature will not complain of
Nature, nor will corruption complain of corruption; it is
onely grace that makes us truly sensible of the bitterness of
sin.</p>

fathers upon the children but onely in the second,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Love</hi> in his I. Ser, on Lam. 5. 7, 8. p. 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 5.
It is well observed by a pious and precious Divine, that there
are <hi>eight sins</hi> which do more especially bring Judgements on
a mans Posterity, whereof the first is <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Adultery, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
               <p>3 Covenant-breaking, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 13.</p>
               <p>4 Persecution of the godly, <hi>Matth. 23. 31. to 36. Psal.
137.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>5 Murder, 1 <hi>King. 21. 21. Jer.</hi> 15. 4.</p>
               <p>6 Oppression, <hi>Job 20. 19, 26. Hab.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
               <p>7 Contempt of Magistracy and Ministry, <hi>Num. 16. 32. 41. 49.
1 King.</hi> 13. 33, 34.</p>
               <p>8 When men <hi>pretend</hi> Reformation, and <hi>intend</hi> themselves,
as <hi>Iehu did,</hi> Hos. 1. 4.</p>
               <p>God is very pittiful and tender over Infants, as appears
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96885:47"/>
in that hee would not destroy <hi>Nineveh</hi> for the Infants sakes
that were in ti, <hi>Ionah</hi> 4, 11. and in the sacking of Cities, hee
commands them to spare Infants, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 14. but it is the
sin of Parents which many times hardens Gods heart against
them, and makes him to delight in the destruction both of
them and theirs; yea and it hardens mens hearts against them,
so that they cannot but act such cruelty against them, as they
never intended, as wee see in <hi>Hazael,</hi> 2 King. 8. 11, 12, 13.
when the Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> wept, and told him what mischief
hee should do to <hi>Israel,</hi> viz. <hi>that hee should kill the young men,
and dash the Infants against the stones, and rend in peeces the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
with childe; Am I a dog</hi> (saith <hi>Hazael) that I should do
such things as these?</hi> Hee then thought it a base and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
thing, when hee was King <hi>Benhadads</hi> servant, to act such
inhumane villany upon the mothers with their infants; the
Prophet onely tell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him that hee shall bee <hi>a King,</hi> vers. 13.
and then when hee had changed his condition, hee would
also change his manners, and commit all the abominations
which hee mentioned. Let Parents then labour for grace,
that they may leave a blessing, and not a curse to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
<hi>Gen. 17. 7. Exod. 20. 6. Psal.</hi> 112. 2. If you will not
pitty your selves, yet pitty your little ones, let not them fare
the worse for you.<note place="margin">V. <hi>Carylon</hi> Job 21. 19. p. 730, 731.</note> It is ill-being a wicked mans childe, yea

was stoned, and his <hi>cattel</hi> with him. Wicked <hi>Egyptians</hi> bring a
Murrain upon their cattel, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 3. As a good man is a
publick good, the Family, City, Kingdome, fare the better
for him, yea his cattel are spared for his sake, <hi>Exod. 9. 4. The
Lord shall sever between the cattel of Egypt, and the cattel of
Israel, there shall nothing dye of all that is the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels.</hi>
God blesseth the very cattel of his people, and if the
creature could speak, it would desire to serve those that serve
God. Most Parents provide Inheritances for their children,
but oft-times they leave their sins with them too. It was a sad
Legacy that <hi>Ioab</hi> left to his children, that one should bee a
Leper, another a weakling, a third beg his bread, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 29.
So many a man, to one childe hee leaves his Murder, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Adultery, to a third his Usury, to a fourth his Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>Gehazi</hi> left a Talent of silver behinde him to his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but hee left the Leprosie with it. Better want such
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96885:47"/>
mens lands and inheritances, than thus to inherit their sins
too.</p>
               <p>2 Let children bee humbled then for their forefathers sins,
that they bee not imputed to them, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ch. 1. 6. and <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 79. 8. <hi>Remember not against us
(iniquitates praecedentium,</hi> saith the Original) <hi>the sins of our
forefathers.</hi> Hee that sees the sins of his Predecessors, and is
not humbled for them, approves of them, and so becomes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to them. Hence the Lord blames <hi>Belshazzar</hi> for not
humbling himself for his fathers sin and punishment which
hee knew of, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 22. Let us therefore acknowledge our
selves to bee the children of sinful parents, and say with him,
<hi>Deut. 26. 5. A Syrian was my father, ready to perish;</hi> and with
<hi>David, Wee have sinned with our fathers,</hi> Psal. 106. 6. and with
<hi>Daniel,</hi> ch. 9. 8. <hi>Deprecate the punishment which is due to u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> for
their sins.</hi> So <hi>Ier.</hi> 14. 20.</p>
               <p>3 Admire the patience of the Lord, that hath born so long
with us who have been sinners from the womb. If little ones
who never sinned against the patience of God as wee have
done, indure such pangs, sorrows, sickness, and death; what
may men of years look for, who have added to original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
a numberless number of actual transgressions? If this
bee done to the green tree, what shall bee done to the dry?
If Infants (who are Innocents, and righteous comparatively)
shall scarcely bee saved, where shall the ungodly and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
sinner appear? If hee spare not little ones that lye in
their mothers bowels, but suffer wicked men to drag them
thence; where, oh where shall those wicked parents appear,
that have been the primary cause of all this mischief and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to them, and have been the authors and actors of that
wickedness which hath brought this misery on them? It should
therefore bee matter of great humiliation to us all, when wee
see the sharp and sore judgements that oft light upon little
ones for their original sin.</p>
               <p>As Gods people were wont in extraordinary cases to bring
their infants and sucklings with them to keep Fasts, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 16.
the better to affect their hearts, and break them with sorrow
for sin, which threatned destruction to them and their little
ones. Even this use should wee make of the miseries of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,

                  <hi>Samaria</hi> shall bee made desolate, for shee hath rebelled.
When Gods heritage is as a Lion that roars and rageth against
him, then hee gives it into the hands of its enemies, <hi>Ier. 12.

their land, carries the people into Captivity, and makes slaves
and exiles of them in a strange Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rebellion</hi> is a capital sin, it is not every sin (though every
sin more or less hath something of rebellion in it, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against that allegiance wee owe unto God by the Law
of Creation) but it is an habitual obstinacy and stubbornness in
sin; hence such are said <hi>to have necks of iron, and brows of
brass, hard and uncircumcised hearts;</hi> they are called <hi>a froward
generation, lying children which refuse to obey the Law,</hi> Isa. 30. 9.
<hi>rebelling against the light,</hi> Job 24. 13.</p>
               <p>It is reckoned amongst the greatest sins, and is compared to
<hi>Witchcraft,</hi> I Sam. 15. 23. which is the highest and most hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Idolatry in the world; it is a renouncing of God, to follow
the counsel of the Devil. It is a sin that God will certainly
visit for, his Justice will not suffer it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And for this the Lord threatens to destroy them, <hi>Hosea 5.

               <p>And is not this <hi>Englands</hi> sin? Are not many, too many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

preferring the chaffe of mens inventions, before the
wheat of Gods word. Let the ablest Minister in the land
preach in some Towns, yet how many are there that prefer a

of his own brain, before the faithful servants of God
that dispense his word sincerely?</p>

So great was the Lords care over them, and so loath was hee
that they should perish, that hee sent <hi>extraordinary Prophets</hi>
to them, more in number than hee did to the Kingdome of
<hi>Iudah,</hi> and by them hee supplied the defect of the ordinary
Ministry of Priests and Levites. They had <hi>Elijah, Elisha, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,
Amos, Micah, Ioel,</hi> and <hi>Hosea,</hi> who prophesied about
seven and forty years unto them, besides these Prophets,
<hi>Ahijah, Semaja, Iehu, Iddo, Amani, Azariah, &amp;c.</hi> yet
such was their obstinacy and perversness, that no wooings, nor
warnings could work upon them: instead of hearkning to those
Messengers which the Lord in great compassion sent unto

These Priests, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> (in his carnal policy) chose out of
the meanest of the people (fit servants for such gods, Calves

               <p>2 What is the Matter of their Speaking? why, it is against

Churches complain against us for it; and what cause wee

black Devil, every one cries shame of; but it is the preaching,
praying, professing Devil, who pretends to extraordinary san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
and mortification that deceives even many a good soul by
its over-much credulity. These are more dangerous (in some
sense) to us, than the very Devil himself; for if the Devil
should appear to us in his own likeness, and ugly shape, wee
should run from him for fear, no man would hearken to him;
if the Devil should come in person, and call men to the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,

when hee comes to us in a friend, a wife, a bosom-companion,

and therefore our Saviour doth not say, Beware of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
but, Beware of those men who are the Instruments of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;
if they should come like Angels, wee should suspect
them, if like Beasts, wee should shun them, if like fiends,
wee should fear them; but coming to us like <hi>men</hi> of the same
profession with us, and professing great kindness to us, how
soon are poor plain souls deceived by such? and therefore <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of men;</hi> for as God loves to work upon men by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of man, and sends them to such: So the Devil, who is
Gods Ape, loves to draw men from God, by men, <hi>viz.</hi> by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers
and deceivers, who are inspired, fitted and filled by
him for that purpose; if <hi>Ahab</hi> will not hear <hi>Micaiah</hi> the true
Prophet of the Lord, the Devil hath four hundred false
Prophets at hand to deceive him. When hee would seduce
<hi>Adam</hi> from his obedience, hee doth not appear himself, but
hee sets <hi>Eve</hi> his wife upon him, and so prevails. When hee
would have innocent <hi>Abel</hi> slain, hee doth not do it himself,
but hee hath a malicious <hi>Cain</hi> that will do it. When the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

Great men many times are great sinners, they have their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

Caution were in season, it is now, when there are so many
Juglers and chearers gone forth into the world. Their number
is greater than formerly, and they act more subtilly and mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,

if they had no bodies, and live so lewdly, as if they had no
souls; hence it is that wee are so oft admonished to take heed
of them, <hi>Rom. 16. 17. 2 Tim. 3. 5. 2 Iohn</hi> 10.</p>

the Devils usual practice, to mix some sugar with his poison,
to make it go down the better; and to mingle some truths
with his errours; as the Fowler mingles corn with his chaff,
that hee may catch the sooner. You will shun those that poison
your bodies, Oh take heed of those that would poison your
souls. No murder like soul-murder. Shun a seducer, as you
would shun the Devil himself, whose factor hee is; and when
hee speaks fairest, and pretends most love, then fear him most;
when <hi>Herod intended</hi> Christs destruction, hee then <hi>pretended</hi>

they could even slay them all, as <hi>Cain</hi> did <hi>Abel,</hi> I John 3.

oft-times doth us more hurt, than by our open enemies; and
therefore when one was praying, <hi>Lord deliver mee from my

mee from my friends.</hi> Wee usually shun our foes, and take

Time discovers mens tempers; the heart of man is so deeply
deceitful, that it requires some time to know it; and if it bee

that the Scripture calls wicked men <hi>Wolves</hi> for ravening, <hi>Dogs</hi>
for greediness, <hi>Lions</hi> for cruelty, and <hi>Foxes</hi> for subtilty. Any

Never was the Land so full of praying and preaching, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,

not in so much danger of <hi>Papism,</hi> now, as of <hi>Atheism;</hi> how
hath this God-provoking, Land-ruining sin over-spread, the
whole Island! wee have all sorts of <hi>Atheism</hi> amongst us,

                     <item>Vocal,</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Wee have <hi>close</hi> Atheists, and <hi>gross</hi> Atheists; wee have A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists
contemplative, and Atheists practical; some are closer
Atheists, they do not directly and plainly cast God out
of the world; yet these fools (who are the worlds wise men)
say in their hearts, <hi>There is no God,</hi> Psal. 14. 1. This kinde of
Atheism is not so easily discovered, nor reproved, and so it
wants that help which gross Atheism meets withall.</p>
               <p>2 Many that confess God in their <hi>words,</hi> yet deny him in
their <hi>works,</hi> and by consequence deny his All-seeing eye and
Being, as if God took no notice of things below; these are
<hi>practical Atheists,</hi> Titus 1. 16. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> sets the brand of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness
upon the fore-head of this sin, <hi>Iob</hi> 22. 5, 13, 14. and
God threatens to search, as with Candles, for such Atheistical
ones, <hi>i. e.</hi> Hee will search narrowly, and sift them thorowly, as
the woman that lighted a candle to search for her lost groat,
<hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 12. yet Atheism is frequently acted in the world in
one degree or other, <hi>Psal. 10. 4. The wicked in the pride of his
heart will not seek after God,</hi> i. e. hee thinks hee hath no need
of him, but hath enough in himself, and therefore hee will not
go to God: <hi>God is not in all his thoughts,</hi> i. e. hee is in none of
his thoughts, no not in one of his thoughts or wayes. It is an
Hebraism. The Devil would fain make men not beleeve that
which himself cannot but beleeve, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a God.
This is one of the highest degrees of wickedness in the world.
To deny God is so high a sin, that it takes away all at once,
the Devil needs not come a second time. This is to sin against
the greatest light, it is not onely a sin against the light of
Christianity, but against the light of nature, against the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the creature, and the whole Creation. Such sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Providence of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and against the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96885:60"/>
of all Nations. <hi>Tully</hi> could say, <hi>There was never any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so barbarous, as to deny that there was a God. I have seen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

City without walls. but never any City but acknowledged a God.</hi>
I have heard of some that have denied that there was a God,
yet never knew the man, but when hee was sick, hee would
seek unto God for help; Therefore (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) They do
but lye, that say, there is no God; they sin against the light
of their own consciences; they who most studiously go about to
deny God, yet cannot do it, but some check of conscience
will flye in their faces; hence Heathens have condemned
some to death, that denied there was a God. This is a Mother-sin,
and the root of all abominations, yea, In every sin there
is a virtual, tacit, interpretative Atheism; they say, as it were,
in their hearts, that God doth not see, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3.
&amp; 73. 11, 12. &amp; 94. 5. to 9. This sin ruined <hi>Ierusalem,
Ezek.</hi> 9. 9. and if it spread in <hi>England,</hi> as it hath done of late
years, it will certainly ruine us also.</p>
               <p>Wee all carry the root of this Prolifical sin about us, and
in every sin there is a grain a least of <hi>Atheism;</hi> when wee
are charged with it, wee are apt to say, as <hi>Hazael, Am I a
Dogg?</hi> hee would not beleeve that there was so much wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in him: Thou shalt bee a King (saith the Prophet) and
then thy corruptions will soon appear, when thou hast power
and opportunity to act them: So say I, thou art a Son of
<hi>Adam,</hi> lapsed and fallen in him, thou hast the seed of this sin
within thee, and when a temptation comes, it will quickly
discover it self to the world.</p>
               <p>2 Take heed of <hi>Polytheism,</hi> which is the ready way to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism;</hi>
the having of many gods, is the ready way to have no
God. An <hi>Omni</hi>-Religion, is the ready way to no Religion.
The world abounds with false gods.</p>
               <p>1 Whatsoever wee have more than God, that is our God,
<hi>Amor tuus, Deus tuus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Whatsoever wee confide in more than God, that is our
God, <hi>Iob</hi> 31. 24.</p>

               </p>
               <p>1 <hi>Ieroboam</hi> their first King came in by Rebellion. <hi>Israel
rebelled</hi> against the house of <hi>David,</hi> and chose <hi>Ieroboam</hi> for
their King, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 19. hence the Lord complains, that
<hi>they set up Kings,</hi> viz. <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and his successors, <hi>but not by
him,</hi> Hos. 8. 4 they did it without asking his advice, or stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for his command; for though hee had decreed to rent the
ten Tribes from <hi>Solomons</hi> race, yet because they did it not in
an orderly way, but tumultuously, therefore hee calls it rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and saith, that <hi>hee knew it not, viz.</hi> so as to approve of it;
and though God had fore-told that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> should bee King,
yet because hee came to the Crown with a proud, aspiring,
rebellions disposition, hee is called <hi>a Rebel,</hi> 2 Chron. 13. 6, 7.
This <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat</hi> (so called, to distinguish him
from <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the second, the Son of <hi>Ioash,</hi> 2 King. 14. 23.)
was <hi>Solomons</hi> servant, a valiant, active, subtil man, and so
more fit to bee the head of a faction. <hi>Solomon</hi> hearing that
the greatest part of his Kingdome was given to <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> hee
was offended with him, and sought to kill him. Kings can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure corrivals. Upon this <hi>Ieroboam</hi> fled into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
where (probably) hee learnt the Idolatry of the Calves, for
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were great Idolaters, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 28, 40. No
sooner is hee in the Throne, but hee sets up a new Religion in
his new Kingdome; Hee begins ill, the very first step hee takes
is out of the way; hee sets up two golden Calves, and draws
all <hi>Israel</hi> to worship them. This crafty <hi>Achitophel</hi> fore-saw,
that if the people should go up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to worship there,
the glory of the Temple might allure them, and the true
Priests of the Lord would bee drawing them to adhere to their
lawful Prince of the house of <hi>David,</hi> 1 King. 12. 27. hee
therefore useth all means to keep them from having any
thoughts of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (though this fear was vain and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
for hee had Gods promise, that if hee would cleave to
him, and worship him onely, that then hee would preserve
the Kingdome to him and his posterity, 1 <hi>King. 12. 38.)</hi> To
this end hee invents a more easie and plausible kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
pretending that it was too much cost and pains for them
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96885:64"/>
to go thrice a year up to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> they should have gods
of their own at home, Two golden Calves, to represent
God to their eyes. These hee sets up, one
in <hi>Dan,</hi>

peradventure (out of a politick device) to ingratiate
himself with <hi>Shisac</hi> the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that hee might the

instead of Gods Temple at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> hee set up
houses of pretended devotion, wherein hee appointed God to

to destroy it from the Earth, 1 <hi>King. 13. ult.</hi> It was a sin,
a sin with a witness, a notorious, hainous, complicated sin, that
had many other sins in the belly of it; it was a sin committed
against <hi>great Light</hi> (for hee had the Prophets, <hi>Ahijah, Semaja</hi>
and <hi>Iddo</hi> to instruct him) and against <hi>great Love,</hi> for the Lord
had raised him from a servant to be King, and that over his own
people <hi>Israel,</hi> and had instructed him what hee should do,
and how hee should walk, that hee might prosper, yet hee
most ungratefully forsakes the God of his mercies, to follow
Calves, and Devils, contrary to the express command of God,
that they should nor make any graven Image, to worship it.
It was also against the Judgement of God on their Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
whom they knew God had cut off for making such an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96885:64"/>
as the golden Calf. Besides, hee changed the time, the
place, the manner of Gods worship, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 32, 33. and
to incourage the people the more in these exorbitant waies,
hee himself usurps the Priests Office, and offers upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
which none but such as God had set apart for that work
might do. Yet more, this sin was a scandal and ruine to all
<hi>Israel,</hi> it drew them from God, and made the Lord to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
them, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 2. Yea some of <hi>Iudah</hi> also were infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Now, shall carnal men bee so industrious for earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and shall wee take no pains for a heavenly one?
shall they labour thus for things that perish, and thus eagerly
pursue what they cannot keep? and shall not wee labour for
heavenly and enduring riches? shall the Kingdomes of the

and shall not the Kingdome of Heaven suffer violence, and
wee bee more zealous for it?</p>

Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> whose fame sounded thorow the world,
are at this day a desolation. The Invisible Church, the Elect

would not submit to <hi>Omri,</hi> whom the souldiers made King,
and the souldiers would not depart from their choice, thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they were divided, which division and contest lasted about
four years, till <hi>Tibni</hi> died (as it is conceived) an untimely
death, and then the souldiers being armed, and too strong for
the people, set up <hi>Omri,</hi> 1 King. 16. 21, 22, 23.</p>

                  <p>7 <hi>Tibni</hi> being dead, <hi>Omri</hi> reigns quietly; hee buyes the
Hill of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and builds a City thereon, which came to
bee the Mettopolis of the Land, and the place of the Kings
Court and residence; for <hi>Zimri</hi> having burnt the Royal
Palace in <hi>Tirzah, Omri</hi> resides in <hi>Samaria,</hi> which was stronger
than <hi>Tirzah,</hi> as appears by the three years siege which it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.
This wicked man being exalted to the Throne, walks
in the steps of his wicked predecessors, and exceeds them in
wickedness; for the Text tells us, <hi>That hee did worse than all
that were before him,</hi> 1 King. 16. 25.</p>
                  <p>1 Because hee persisted in his Idolatry, notwithstanding
all the judgements of God which hee had seen upon his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors.</p>
                  <p>2 Because hee did with more violence force and press the
people to Idolatry; hence wee read of the Statutes of <hi>Omri,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96885:71"/>
viz.</hi> concerning their Idolatrous worship of the golden
Calves, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1 There is no stability in earthly things.</p>
                  <p>They are vain, uncertain, mutable. One while the Royal
Court is in the City of <hi>Sechem,</hi> anon it is removed to <hi>Tirzah,</hi>
and then to <hi>Iezreel,</hi> and at last <hi>Samaria</hi> is the Metropolis,
2 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 29.</p>
                  <p>2 The successors of wicked men many times exceed their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
in wickedness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Omri</hi> here is worse than all that were before him. So the
Scholars of <hi>Arminius</hi> and <hi>Socinus,</hi> have out-erred their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
The Anabaptists and Separatists of our times, are far
more erronious than they were in Episcopal times. Errbrs in
the first concoction, are not amended in the second. As good
men do improve the choice notions of their predecessors to
Gods honour: so wicked men do improve the corrupt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and practices of their wicked predecessors to God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.</p>
                  <p>3 Wicked men are obstinate in sin.</p>
                  <p>Nothing works upon them. Let <hi>Ieroboam, Nadab, Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha,
Elah, Zimri</hi> bee plagued, both they and their posterity
for their Idolatty, yet <hi>Omri</hi> stirs not, unless it bee to evil,
but hee is <hi>Omri</hi> still, as Idolatrous, as vile, yea worse than
ever.</p>
                  <p>8 <hi>Omri</hi> after twelve years reign, dies, and <hi>Ahab</hi> the wicked
Son of a wicked Father succeeds him.<note place="margin">Pessimi Patris, pessimus Filius.</note> Hee
reigns two and twenty years, and is a <hi>Non</hi>-such
for wickedness.<note place="margin">How hee exceeded all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors in wickedness, in twelve particulars, see our large Annot, on 1 King. 16. 33.</note> All the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> before
him, and after him, were bad, but none so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
as <hi>Ahab,</hi> who <hi>sold himself to do evil,
1 King.</hi> 16. 30, 31, 32, 33. A good man may bee
<hi>Passively</hi> sold under sin against his will, as <hi>Paul</hi>

himself wittingly and wilfully, as a slave to the service of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
the lusts of the flesh, and the cursed plots of his wife.
So that I cannot but wonder at a learned Commentator of
our times, who makes <hi>Paul</hi> to bee like <hi>Ahab,</hi> that sold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to wickedness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14.</p>

<hi>Naboth,</hi> gets his Vineyard, persecutes the Prophets and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, counrenanceth eight hundred and fifty false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
to <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Idolatry, hee adds the worship of <hi>Baal</hi> in
the Mountain of <hi>Samaria,</hi> which was far worse than the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> for though they had Idols, yet they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to worship the true God, but in this they worshipped
<hi>Baal</hi> himself, as appears by that speech of <hi>Elijah,</hi> of <hi>Baal bee
God,</hi> implying that they esteemed him so.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Ieroboam</hi> erected the golden Calves, to preserve the
Kingdome to himself, but <hi>Ahab</hi> peaceably possest the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
yet desiberately hee sets up more Idols.</p>
                  <p>3 Hee knew the <hi>Zidonians</hi> were great worshippers of <hi>Baal,</hi>
yet hee fears not to match with a <hi>Iesabel</hi> there, that stirred him
up to a greater height of wickedness, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 25. shee was
a proud, cruel, cursed Idolatress, a fierce persecutor of Gods
people, and a great promoter of the worship of <hi>Baal;</hi> hence
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> calls that false Prophetess that seduced so many to
uncleanness and Idolatry, <hi>Iesabel,</hi> Rev. 2. 20. And <hi>Iehu</hi>
chargeth her with whoredome and witchcraft. This <hi>Ahab</hi>
was slain in battel by the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the doggs lick his blood,
and hee is buried in <hi>Samaria</hi> his chief City, and his posterity
is cursed after him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 22, 23, 24.</p>

and act for sin with all his might, though hee ruine himself
by it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. Thus it was with <hi>Ahab</hi> here, hee had not
hired himself out to sin for a week, a month, a year, but hee
had wholly sold himself as a slave for ever to the service of
sin and Satan; so that hee could neither think, speak, or act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, but what had a tendency to sin. Hee was a King, and
by his place hee should have ruled others,<note place="margin">Tu servus ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorum es, iis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ahab</hi> sets up <hi>Baal,</hi> and God pulls down him. How can they
expect Peace on Earth, that fight with Heaven? The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is now troubled, <hi>Samaria</hi> besieged, a famine in the Land,
no dew nor rain for three years and a half; <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iesabel</hi>
are slain, and <hi>Ahabs</hi> seventy Sons cut off. These, these are the
fruits of Idolatry, and forsaking God. It is worth observing,
what Tumults, Treasons, Treachery, King-killing, Wars, and
changing of the Royal Lines there was throughout the reign of
these Idolatrous Kings of <hi>Israel. Solomon,</hi> that first set up Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
had three enemies upon him. 1 <hi>Hadad</hi> the Edomite.
2 <hi>Rezin</hi> King of <hi>Damascus. 3 Ieroboam</hi> his servant. So, when
<hi>Ioram</hi> King of <hi>Iudah</hi> walked in the waies of Idolatrous <hi>Ahab,</hi>
then <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Libnah</hi> revolt from him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 18, 20.
But on the contrary, see what success and renown <hi>Iudah</hi> had,
who was more faithful to God. They had nineteen Kings of
<hi>Israel,</hi> all of the same stock, succeeding each other; whereas
among the twenty Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> there were ten several
Kings, and they of several stocks, and they frequently destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
each other to get into the Throne, and lived not long,
whereas <hi>Asa,</hi> one of the good Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> out-lived <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,
Nadab, Baasha, Elah, Zimri, Tibni, Omri,</hi> and some
part of <hi>Ahabs</hi> time.</p>

                     <hi>Obs.</hi> 1 Where there is but some goodness, and some reformation,

                  <p>Hee takes notice, nor onely of mens vices, but also of their

Many, like flyes, pass over the sound flesh, and light upon that
which is galled; or like Beetles, they flye over all the flowers
in a field, and if there bee any dung in it, that they creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
So it is with most, they pry into mens infirmities, but pass
by their Graces. But Christ did commend the Churches for
what was good in them, as well as reprove them for their fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 3. Christ takes notice, not onely of the grown
fruit, but of the green buds, and tender Grapes, even of the
beginnings of Grace in young converts, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 13. Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
is sullen, sowre, and censorious, especially to young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners;
but true Grace is meek, merciful and tender. It is
our duty to acknowledge Grace, where ever wee finde it, be it
in Jew or Gentile, in rich or poor, old or young. Where ever
wee finde but <hi>aliquid Christi,</hi> some seeds of piety, and the
fear of the Lord, wee should love and cherish it. Hence
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:96885:74"/>
Christ commends <hi>Natharael</hi> (that had but some seeds of
Grace) for his sincerity, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 47. The Centurion, though
a <hi>Gentile,</hi> yet Christ commends him for his Faith, <hi>Matth. 8.
10.</hi> Christ took notice of such as did improve their Talents,
and calls them good and faithful, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 21, 23. And
Christ testifies of <hi>Mary,</hi> that shee loved much, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 47.
Sad then is the condition of those that are so blinded with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
that they cannot see the graces of God in others,
without indignation; like <hi>Cain,</hi> that hated his Brother,
because hee was better than himself, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 12. Or like
<hi>Ioshua,</hi> that was envious at <hi>Eldad,</hi> and <hi>Madad,</hi> for prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying
in the Camp, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 29. Wee may not bear false
witness against our neighbour, but must acknowledge the
Grace of God in them to his praise. Our eye must not bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
because Gods eye is good. It is the Devils work to bee
the slanderer and accuser of the Brethren; let him do his work
himself, <hi>Iob 1. 9, 10. Rev.</hi> 12. 10. But let us imitate our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
who hath a tender care, not onely of his strong rooted
Oaks, and bright burning Tapers, but also of his weak, bruised
Reeds, and smoaking Flax, though as yet it flame not, <hi>Mat.
12.</hi> 20. Yea, where there is but civility and common good,
Christ takes notice of it, and commends it; when the young
man came to Christ, (though hee had no true grace) yet
it is said, <hi>Christ loved him,</hi> Mark. 10. 21. Hee also took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of that discreet answer of that Scribe, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. 34. and
said to him, <hi>Thou art not far from the Kingdome of God.</hi> This
should incourage us to bee active for Christ, who covers our
infirmities, takes notice of our services, and will reward them
openly.</p>
                  <p>2 Hypocrites reform to halves.</p>

things, but his <hi>Herodias</hi> hee will not part withall. It is said of

11 <hi>Iehu</hi> the Son of <hi>Nimshi</hi> (for now the line of succession
is again changed) having slain <hi>Ioram</hi> the Son of <hi>Ahab,</hi> gets

at <hi>Elisha</hi>'s command, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 16. and 2 <hi>King. 9. 6.
2 Chron.</hi> 22. 7. The reason why hee onely of all the Kings of
<hi>Israel</hi> (since the division) was anointed with Oyl, was this,
because his work was hard and extraordinary, and therefore
the Lord, to make him the more couragious, and confident,
assures him, by this visible sign, that hee had called him, and
hee would keep him in his office. Hee being an active, vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
politick man, Commander in Chief over the Army in
the City of <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> and so, highly esteemed amongst
the Captains and souldiers, was raised by God to execute his
vengeance on the house of <hi>Ahab.</hi> Having slain <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King
of <hi>Iudah,</hi> 2 King 9. 27. Hee then cuts off <hi>Iesabel,</hi> 2 King.

hee burns his Images, destroies the house of <hi>Baal,</hi>
and makes it a draught-house, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 25, 26, 27, 28.
This was good service, and such as God had commanded and

for his service, <hi>viz.</hi> that his posterity to the fourth Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
should sit upon his Throne, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 30. Yet this
<hi>But</hi> lies on him as a blot, that hee countenanced and practised
that part of Idolatry which consisted in the faise worship of the
true God, brought in by <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who set up the Golden
Calves, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 29. And for this God punisheth him. 1 In
his own daies, God smote him in all the coasts of <hi>Israel,</hi> 2 King.

onely leaped out of the Surpless, but out of the Ministry, and
out of the Church too. They have not onely cast out the Font,
but the Infant also. The Ceremonies are gone, and some are
casting the substance after them. Set forms are gone, and
now they would have no prayers at all. Oh the folly and
madness of this licentious age! Do wee thus requite the
Lord, O foolish and unwise! Is this the thanks wee give
him for all his Ordinances, Mercies, and great deliverances,
to separate from the Assemblies of his people, to contemn
his Ordinances, the pledges of his love unto us, to vilifie his
Ministers, and hate the paths of purity and peace? The Lord
hath born long with this Athestical brood, but hee will not

it <hi>Murder,</hi> and threatens to avenge the blood of <hi>Ahab</hi> on the

God, but for himself, to settle the Crown faster on his own

one false way, and did tollerate another; and therefore the

one and forty years; not one of his rank reigned so long; hee
was one of the most prosperous, successful, and victorious of
all the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> since the division of the ten Tribes.
Hee recovered the antient borders of <hi>Israel</hi> from the <hi>Syrians,</hi>
and made them tributary to himself. The ground of all this
goodness is given, 2 <hi>King. 14. 23, 25, 26, 27, 28. The
Lord saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter, for there
was none shut up or left, nor any helper left, therefore the Lord out
of his wonted mercy raised up Jeroboam to bee a Saviour to them;</hi>
Yet hee is stigmatized with the old brand that his predecessor
had before him, <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And that which aggravates his sin is this, 1 That hee sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

                  <p>
                     <hi>Israel</hi> never flourisht (since the division of the ten Tribes)
under any King, as it did under this: <hi>Joash</hi> and <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> had
done valiantly before, but <hi>Jeroboam</hi> excells them all. Under
him the Kingdome flourisht<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in riches, honours, victories, and
great success. But after this its honour and power still decaied,
till it was totally ruined. It was in this Kings reign, that <hi>Hosea</hi>
fore-told the destruction of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Hos. 1. 1. And <hi>Amos</hi>
fore-told the ruine of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and his house, <hi>Amos</hi> 1. 2. and
7. 8, 9, 10, 11. Idolatrous Kingdomes cannot stand long;
<hi>Babylon</hi> may think to sit as a Queen, but sorrows shall at last
surprize her, and no worldly pomp or power shall bee able to
keep off Gods judgements from her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 7, 8. All King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
have their rise and ruine, and when they bee at the
height, then they decrease and moulder away, as wee see in

                  <p>
                     <hi>Israel</hi> now had three extraordinary Prophets sent unto them,
<hi>viz. Ionah, Amos, Hosea,</hi> three eminently holy, bold men,
that spared not to tell them of their sins, as appears by their
Prophecies; yet Prince and people contemning their warnings,
and persisting in their sins, about thirty years after they were
rooted up, and lead into captivity by the proud <hi>Assyrian;</hi> So it
was with <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> it had the best Preachers not long before
its ruine. There was Christ and his Apostles, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
the Gospel,<note place="margin">See <hi>Iosephus</hi> his History. 1. 7. c. 18.</note> crucifying the Lord of glory, stoning his
Prophets, and abusing his messengers; about forty years after
it was sackt by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespatian,</hi> and laid in the dust.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>London</hi> was never so richly stored with pious, painful, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Ministers of the Gospel, nor the Nation so richly furnisht
with able and industrions Preachers, as at this day. But if Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Country go on to sleight and vilifie the faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Christ, as they have done of late; and instead of the
power of Religion, rest content with a formal, hypocritical
profession of it; a man that is no Prophet, nor Prophets Son,
may easily fore-see judgement approaching. When the Sun
shines hot test, harvest is at hand. The glorious sun-shine of
the Gospel, ripens men apace, either for Heaven, or Hell.
God will not bear so long with sinners now, as hee did in
times of Ignorance, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 30.</p>
                  <p>4 When Gods Messengers are not prized, hee removes them.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Israel</hi> regard not <hi>Ionah</hi>'s Ministery, God will send him
from them to <hi>Niniveh,</hi> that populous City. When people are
dead under lively Oracles, and barren under fruitful means,
God will either remove that people from the Ministery, or
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96885:81"/>
the Ministery from them. Hee will not alwaies plow the
Rocks, and sow the Sands, nor take pains with a people that
shall bring forth nothing but briars and thorns; when a people
bee rebellious, God either takes away his Prophets, or makes
them dumb, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 26.</p>
                  <p>Many blame Ministers in our daies for removing from place
to place, and if they do it without just cause, so do I. But
people must know, that there are many just causes of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
removal from one place to another; some of which I
shall set down,
<list>
                        <head>As,</head>
                        <item>1 In case of Persecution.</item>
                        <item>2 In case of Corporal Weakness and Sickness.</item>

                        <item>4 When the Maintenance is Incompetent.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>1 In case of Persecution, especially if it bee personal, and
the Minister bee specially aimed at; then our Saviour tells us,
that being persecuted in one City, they may fly to another,
and reserve themselves for better times. This
is granted by all sober men,<note place="margin">V. Aug. Ep. 180. Aquinas 2. 2ae. Q. 185. art. 5. <hi>Pet. Martyr. D.</hi> Geo. Abbot, in Thesib. cap. 5. de fuga in persecutione &amp; peste. p. 169. Et prae aliis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shall refer the Reader to the Margin for fuller
satisfaction. Thus, when a Minister desires to

cannot endure sound Doctrine, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3.

case is clear, and wee may shake off the dust of our feet against
such wilful contemners of the Gospel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 14. Though a
peoples present barrenness under his Ministery bee no just
cause of his removal, yet when a people shall set themselves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously
against a mans Ministery, it varies the case. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<hi>Lot</hi> from the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> when from day to day they
vexed his righteous soul with their malicious wickedness.</p>

                     </note> Some constitutions will not away with
some Climats; a Minister may love a people, and they him,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:96885:82"/>
and yet for want of health and strength to go thorow with the
work of his Ministery, hee may lawfully change places with
one of a stronger constitution. The like may bee said for
those who preach to a great Congregation, but by reason of
weakness, their voice is so low, that half the people cannot
hear them; in this case they may remove to a lesser Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
where they may bee better heard.</p>
                  <p>3 <hi>Upon Improvement of Abilities.</hi> A young man begins to
exercise his gifts in some obscure Chapel, or little place; but
by study and exercise his parts are improved, and hee fitted
for some more eminent and publick place. In this case also
a man may lawfully, and without offence remove. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
would have him that used <hi>the office of a Deacon we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
to the Ministery,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 13. A diligent man staies not
long in a low place. Wee see it is thus in all callings, upon
Improvement of Abilities. The Barrester is made a Reader,
the Reader a Serjeant, the Serjeant a Judge, the Judge a chief
Justice, &amp;c. And why will not men allow of that in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
which is approved of in all other professions?</p>
                  <p>It is a very safe way to have young mens gifts and lives tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and exercised in lesser. Congregations at first, and being
found faithful in a little, then to make them Rulers over
greater Congregations. It is a temptation to put a green head
into a great place, when hee hath neither grace, gifts, nor gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
fit for the place. It either puffs them up, or makes them
idle (if the means bee great) or else they are discouraged,
and sink under the burden, being unable to grapple with the
oppositions and contradictions of sinners, which are incident
to such great places. They had need to bee solid, seasoned,
substantial peeces, that have the weight of the building lying
on them.</p>
                  <p>4 <hi>When the Maintenance is Incompetent.</hi> If a man have a
great family to maintain, but the means is so small, that hee
cannot maintain his family, nor go thorow the works of his
Ministery, with that comfort and credit as becomes a Minister
of the Gospel; in such a case also it is lawful to remove. Wee
see it is fo in all callings; if a man cannot live in one Town,
hee may lawfully remove to another. God would have the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Gospel not to beg,<note place="margin">V. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l Terrae. cap. 9.</note> but to live comfortably in
their Ministery; and to bee maintained not like Swine-heards,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:96885:82"/>
but like the Ambassadors of Christ, with a competent, fixed,
honourable maintenance. The Levites that had their Tythes
taken from them, left their stations without blame, <hi>Neh.
13.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>5 Whereas many think that a Minister can remove at his
pleasure from place to place, and get what place soever
pleaseth him, they are much deceived; for God hath decreed
and fore-appointed Ministers to their places before they are
born. Hee hath decreed how long such a Minister shall abide
in such a place, and how long in such a place, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 26. and
though wee are loath to remove, yet when providence calls,
bee the means more or less, it matters not, wee must obey,
<hi>Gen. 12. 1. 4. Act.</hi> 7. 3. 5. And if a Sparrow cannot fall to the
ground, nor a hair from our heads, without a providence,
much less can a Minister remove from one Congregation to
another without a providence; so that the quarrelling Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
with the rest of that rout, who rail at us when wee
justly remove from place to place, do not so much revile us, as
the Lord, who is the disposer of us; he is the Potter, and we are
the clay, hee may raise us, or ruine us, plant us, or transplant us,
as hee sees good, and none may say unto him, What dost
thou? It is not wee, but the Holy Ghost that sets us over our
flocks, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But why doth the Lord remove men from place to
place, as hee did the Apostles sometimes, why doth hee not fixe
them to one place?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Lord is a free agent, and is not bound to give
us a reason of his doings, it may satisfie us that it is his good
pleasure to have it so, <hi>Psal. 39. 9. Matth.</hi> 11. 25, 26.</p>
                  <p>2 If nothing will satisfie you without a Reason, reasons
enow may bee given.</p>
                  <p>1 Sometimes people hate and persecute their Ministers,
and look upon them as a burden, not a blessing; it is fit such
should bee eased, and made to know the worth of the mercy,
by the wanting of it.</p>
                  <p>2 Sometimes people are barren under the means of grace,
and do not value the Gospel according to its worth, it is just
with God to remove it to those who will prize it better.
When the <hi>Iews</hi> contemned the Gospel, the Apostle left them
and went to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Act. 13. 46. The Kingdome of God
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96885:83"/>
shall bee taken from such, and bee given to those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that will
bring forth the fruit of it.</p>
                  <p>3 As for the Apostles, there was great reason why they
were not fixed to one place:</p>
                  <p>1 Because the Church was then in planting, but not plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>2 They were to spread the Gospel over the world, and
therefore were not confined to any fixed charge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caution.</hi> Yet to prevent scandal, these <hi>Cautions</hi> would bee
remembred.</p>
                  <p>1 Because many are apt to cavil and cry, Ministers are
<hi>covetous,</hi> and remove without a cause; let none remove rashly,
ambitiously, self-seekingly, but judiciously, and piously, for
the profit and edification of the Church; and the better to
stop the mouthes of adversaries, it were well if in such cases
men would not bee their own judges, but refer the hearing of
the case, with all its circumstances, to the Presbytery, or for
want of that, to some neighbour Ministers, who are able to
judge and determine the case.</p>
                  <p>2 They must do what in them lyes to provide an able suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour
for the place they leave,<note place="margin">See my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tim. 4 12.</note> that the Church bee not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided
of a faithful Pastor.</p>
                  <p>3 If after all this, any shall bee found to make it their
trade to remove from place to place, solely to get more means,
and shall refuse to refer their cause to the hearing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of sober, pious, judicious Ministers, let them
bear their shame for mee, I shall never plead for such.</p>
                  <p>By all that hath been said, wee may see,</p>
                  <p>1 That some offend in the <hi>Defect,</hi> whilst they hold it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
for a man upon any occasion to remove, whereas Christ
who is the Lord of the harvest, hath not onely power to call
Ministers, but also to transfer them from one Church to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

them in paths of ungodliness and Idolatry; They sinned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly

creatures observe the word of Gods command, and fulfil the

                  <p>At which sight I found much unwillingness in my self, yet
<pb facs="tcp:96885:88"/>
sitting still with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rembling, there came upon mee a very great
weight, pressing mee to obedience; yea a heavy burthen was
felt, till I had consented to obey; I felt the weight to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease;
oh how hard my unwilling will was to yeeld, but the
Lord strengthened mee, and having consented, I found a little
ease, yea I did resolve in the power of the Lord to go on: <hi>I
purposed to carry with mee a Pocket to sow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the first day morning being the third day of the fifth
month after the eighth hour one of the Doors being open, I
passed in, thinking to get into the Pulpit to hide my self
there till their singing time, and then get up and work; The
Sexton spying mee, took mee by the arm, said, friend, wee do
not open yet, for it was their Communion day, as they call it:
but the time I was in, I found that the Galleries were higher
than the Pulpit, and I should have been discovered before
their song began; I see the Clerk giving Tickets: so about the
ninth hour their Doors were opened, I passed in as one of
their own crowd, the throng came in very fast, I gat into one
of the Galleries to spy if possible to get in the Pulpit some
way, but I found none at that time, so they began to read,
and I came down, and finding no way to get into the Pulpit,
I came to the Table that is prepared so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that troop, I thought
to get upon the Table to work, but the Table was set round
with young men, and when they began their song, they laid
on their hats upon the Table, so I standing still waiting on the
Lord, having a great minde to do the Lords work, their song
being up, my hat offended them, they took it off, and cast it
away, and one of the young men gave it mee again, I put it
on, and it offended again, in so much that <hi>Piercefall</hi> did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
mee, who came violently, and took my hat off to fling
it away, but I held it, then hee took mee by the hair of the
head, and dragg'd mee out, and as one of their own company
testified to his face that hee struck mee, but I cannot say that,
but a lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ty red hair'd man did strike mee, I supposed him to be
an officer in that hateful place, but <hi>Piercefall</hi> after hee had
dragged mee out by the hair, said, Sirrah, Do you not know
<hi>William Duike,</hi> I said nay, for I did not know him; Sirrah, said
hee, I put him in prison, and fined him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

must bee served so too, and so charged the Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>table with mee,
and went himself in again, and received the Sacrament for all
this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:96885:89"/>
The Constable told mee that I might go away if I would, but
in again I must not. So I stood a while, and finding in my self
no constraint, I passed away towards <hi>More-fields,</hi> finding a
little ease from the weight of the burden, being faithful to what
might bee done at that time: but the sixth day of the week, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the eighth day of the month, sitting at work in my Shop but
not on the Shop-board, the burden of the Lord came upon mee,
and the light making manifest the same thing that was not yet
done, must bee done, and the Lord would not discharge mee,
but laid a necessity upon mee. I beholding this with trembling
and fear, I did resolve in the power of the Lord not to eat nor
drink, till I had performed the Lords requiring. So having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in heart, I greatly desired the Lords assistance; and it
was shewed mee how to do it, and the Lord made way for mee.</p>
                  <p>So the first day of the week, being the tenth day of the fifth
month, I waited opportunity till the singing time began, which
when I heard, I passed in, but being fearful to bee taken with
the hat again, and so lose my main business, for the Lord: I stept
out again, but stayed not, I came in again, I lookt towards the
Pulpit, and spied the Pue door open, that the Priest might pass
up the Pulpit. So I waited, thinking that <hi>Edmund Calamy</hi> would
go up the Pulpit, I intended to get in before him; for thought
I, that boy that sits upon the stairs, will open the Pulpit door
for the Priest, and I will get in before, but no Priest came,
whereupon in the power of the Lord, I fixed my eye upon the
Pulpit, and I spied an Iron hook, and I passed thorow the Pue
up the stairs, and unhookt the door, and pulled twice, and gat
it open, and <hi>I sate my self down upon the Cushin, and my feet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the seat where the Priest when hee hath told out his lies doth sit
down, and having my work ready, I pulled one or two stitches.</hi> The
people lost their song, and some cried, pull him down, some,
break his neck down, and a lusty fellow came up, and did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to do mee a mischief, <hi>and rang my neck, as if hee would
have wrung it in two.</hi> So I let go my hold, and hee flang mee
down stairs, but the Lord preserved mee, and I felt no hurt; for
having <hi>done that which the Lord required mee to do,</hi> I was full
of peace; and it had been little to mee if they had there taken
away, or killed the body. For I was full of joy, and they were
full of wrath and madness; so they tore my Coat off, and my
hat, and dragged mee out, and one took mee by the hair, and
<pb facs="tcp:96885:89"/>
flung mee upon the ground, and some that was without
said, why do yee use the man so? but I gate up again,
then they dragged mee quite out into the street, and
there held mee, and while they held mee, one came, and
gave mee a violent kick on the shins, and said, hee could
finde in his heart to knock mee down, hee made my shin bleed,
and another kickt mee on the other shin, but did not much
hurt, another said that I had been some notorious sinner here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
and now came to do something that might merit; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
the Church-warden, as they call him, came out, and
hee and the Bell-toller carried mee away to the Counter,
till their Sermon was ended, as they call it, then they carried
mee away to <hi>Pauls</hi> Yard, to stay for the Mayor, but the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
said, hee would carry mee away to the Mayors house, and
there stay mee till hee came in, so hee did: And all the way
thorow <hi>Paternoster-Row</hi> as I went, the boyes kickt my heels, so
then the Mayor came in, and they told him that I was at
work in the Pulpit; then said hee to mee, Wherefore did you
work there? I said, <hi>in obedience to the Lords commandement;</hi> hee
said, It was a false spirit, and said hee, Where are your sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
I said, The Lord was my surety; hee said, The Lord
would not bear mee out in this thing; said hee to them, Carry
him again to the Counter; so they carried mee back again, and
there I was till the third day.</p>
                  <p>Now let all sober people judge whether I did this thing out
of envy against either Priest or People.</p>
                  <p>Yea further, I say, the Lord God lay it not to their charge,
who have said that I did it in malice, devilishness, and envy;
it is the desire of my soul that they might bee saved,</p>
