            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable, PEREGRINE, Lord Marquiss of <hi>Carmarthen,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>My Lord,</p>
            <p>BEing equally a stranger to your Lordship, and the whole Nobility of this Kingdom, something of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral impulse and aspiring motion in my inclinations, has prompted me, tho I hazzard a presumption, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my Respect. And be the Success how it will, I am vain of nothing in this piece, but the choice of my Patron; I shall be so far thought a judicious Author, whose principal busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is to design his Works an offering to the greatest Honour and Merit.</p>
            <p>I cannot here, my Lord, stand accused of any sort of Adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but to my self, because Compliments due to Merit return upon the giver, and the only flattery is to my self, whilst I attempt your Lordships praise. I dare make no essay on your Lordships youthful Bravery and Courage, because such is always guarded with Modesty, but shall venture to present you some lines on this Subject, which the world will undoubtedly apply to your Lordship.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Courage, the highest gift, that scorns to bend</l>
               <l>To mean devices for a sordid end.</l>
               <l>Courageâ€”an independant spark from Heaven's bright Throne,</l>
               <l>By which the Soul stands rais'd, triumphant, high, alone.</l>
               <l>Great in it self, not praises of the crowd,</l>
               <l>Above all vice, it stoops not to be proud.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:94071:3"/>
Courage, the mighty attribute of powers above,</l>
               <l>By which those great in War, are great in Love.</l>
               <l>The spring of all brave Acts is seated here,</l>
               <l>As falshoods draw their sordid birth from fear.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The best and noblest part of mankind pay homage to Royalty, what veneration then is due to those Vertues and Endowments which even engag'd the respect of Royalty it self, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of one of the greatest Emperours in the World, who chose your Lordship not only as a Companion, but a Conductor.</p>
            <p>He wanted the Fire of such a <hi>Britton</hi> to animate his cold <hi>Russians,</hi> and wou'd therefore choose you his Leader in War, as in Travel: he knew the Fury of the <hi>Turk</hi> cou'd be only stopt by an <hi>English</hi> Nobleman, as the Power of <hi>France</hi> was by an <hi>English</hi> King. A sense of this greatness which might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others, animates me to Address your Lordship; resolv'd that my first Muse shou'd take an high and daring flight, I aspir'd to your Lordships Protection for this trifle, which I must own my self now proud of, affording me this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Humbly declaring my self,</p>
            <p>My Lord,</p>
            <p>Your Lordships most devoted Servant,</p>
            <p>G. Farquhar.</p>

               <p>Very pretty! Five year a Soldier, and Fifteen a Beggar!â€”This is Hell right! an age of Damnation for a momentary offence. Thy condition fellow, is preferable to mine; the merciful Bullet, more kind than thy ungrateful Country, has given thee a Debenter in thy broken Leg, from which thou canst draw a more plentiful maintenance than I from all my Limbs in perfection. Prethee friend, why wouldst thou beg of me? Dost think I'm rich?</p>

               <speaker>Crip.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir, and therefore I believe you charitable. Your warm fellows are so far above the sense of our Misery, that they can't pitty us; and I have always found it, by sad experience, as needless to beg of a rich Man as a Clergyman. Our greatest Benefactors, the brave Officers are all disbanded, and must now turn Beggars like my self; and so, Times are very hard, Sir.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roeb.</speaker>
               <p>What, are the Soldiers more charitable than the Clergy.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Crip.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, Sir, A Captain will say Dam'me, and give me Six-pence; and a Parson shall whine out God bless me, and give me not a farthing: Now I think the Officers Blessing much the best.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Crip.</speaker>
               <p>The great full Wigs they wear, stop their Ears so close, that they can't hear us; and if they shou'd, they never have any farthings about'em.</p>

               <p>Then I am a Beau, friend; therefore pray leave me. Begging from a generous Soul that has not to bestow, is more tormenting than Robbery to a Miser in his abundance. Prethee friend, be thou charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for once; I beg only the favour which rich friends bestow, a little Advice. I am as poor as thou art, and am designing to turn Soldier.</p>

                  <p>Ay, you Poets mount first on the Shoulders of your Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, to see farther in making Discoveries; and having once got the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-hand, you spurn them under-foot.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lyr.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, if most of their Writings had been burnt. I declare, Mr. <hi>Lovewell,</hi> their Fame has only made them the more remarkably faulty: Their great Beauties only illustrate their greating Errors.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lov.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Lyr.</speaker>
                  <p>Very well; it made me laugh heartily.</p>

                  <p>I laugh to see the Ladies cry. To see so many weep at the Death of the fabulous Hero, who would but laugh if the Poet that made 'em were hang'd? On my Conscience, these Tragedies make the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies vent all their Love and Honour at their Eyes, when the same white Hankerchief that blows their Noses, must be a Winding-Sheet to the deceased Hero.</p>

                  <speaker>Lov.</speaker>
                  <p>Then there's something in the Handkerchief to embalm him, Mr. <hi>Lyrick,</hi> Ha, ha, ha.â€”But what relish have you of Comedy?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>No satisfactory oneâ€”My curiosity is fore-stall'd by a fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what shall happen. For as the Hero in Tragedy is either a whining cringing Fool that's always a stabbing himself, or a ranting hectoring Bully that's for killing every-body else: so the Hero in Comedy is always the Poet's Character.</p>

                  <speaker>Lov.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lyr.</speaker>
                  <p>A Compound' of practical Rake, and speculative Gentleman, who always bears of the great Fortune in the Play, and Shams the Beau and 'Squire with a Whore or Chambermaid; and as the Catastrophe of all Tragedies is Death, so the end of Comedies is Marriage.</p>

                  <p>And therefore my eyes are diverted by a better Comedy in the Audience than that upon the Stage.â€”I have often wonder'd why Men shou'd be found of seeing Fools ill represented, when at the same time and place they may behold the mighty Originals acting their Parts to the Life in the Boxes.â€”</p>

                  <p>Oh be favourable to the Ladies, Mr. <hi>Lyrick,</hi> 'tis your Interest. Beauty is the Deity of Poetry; and if you rebel, you'll certainly run the Fate of your first Parent, the Devil.</p>

                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>You're out, Sir. Beauty is a merciful Deity, and allows us some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be a little Atheistical; and 'tis so indulgent to Wit, that it is pleas'd with it, tho' in the worst habit, that of Satyr. Besides, there can appear no greater Argument of our Esteem, than Raillery, because
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94071:26"/>
'tis still founded upon Jealousie; occasion'd by their preferring sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Fops and Wealthy Fools to Men of Wit and Merit, the great Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of the Empire.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lov.</speaker>
                  <p>Now I think these Favourites of the Ladies are more Witty than you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lyr.</speaker>
                  <p>How so, pray, Sir?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lov.</speaker>
                  <p>Because they play the Fool, conscious that it will please; and you're a Wit, when sensible that Coxcombs only are encourag'd. I wonder, Mr. <hi>Lyrick,</hi> that a man of your sense should turn Poet; you'll hardly ever find a Man that is capable of the Imployment will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lyr.</speaker>
                  <p>The reason of that is, every one that knows not a tittle of the matter pretends to be a judge of it.â€”By the Lard, Mr. <hi>Lovewell,</hi> I put the Criticks next to Plague, Pestilence and Famine in my Litany.â€”Had you seen 'em last night in the Pit, with such demure supercili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Facesâ€”their contemplative Wigs thrust judiciously backwards; their hands rubbing their Temples to chaff ill nature; and with a hissing venomous Tongue pronouncing. Pish! Stuff! Intollerable! Damn him!â€”Lord have mercy upon us.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lov.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, and you shall have others as foolish as they are ill-natur'd; fond of being thought Wits, who shall laugh outragiously at every smutty Jest; cry, Very well, by Gad; that's fine, by Heavens; and if a Dystich of Rhime happens, they clap so damnably loud, that they drown the Jest.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lyr.</speaker>
                  <p>That's the Jest. The Wit lies in their hands; and if you would tell a Poet his Fortune, you must gather it from the Palmist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Audience; for as nothing's ill said, but what's ill taken; so nothing's well said, but what's well taken. And betweeen you and I, Mr. <hi>Lovewell,</hi> Poetry without these laughing Fools, were a Bell without a Clapper; an empty sounding bus'ness, good for nothing; and all we Professors might go hang our selves in the Bell-ropes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lov.</speaker>
                  <p>Ha, ha, ha.â€”But I thought Poetry was instructive.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lyr.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh Gad forgive me, that's true; To Ladies it is morally bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial; For you must know they are too nice to read Sermons; such Instructions are too gross for their refin'd apprehensions: but any Precepts that may be instill'd by easie Numbers, such as of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and others, make great Converts. Then they hate to hear a fellow in Church preach methodical Nonsense, with a <hi>Firstly, Secondly,</hi> and <hi>Thirdly:</hi> but they take up with some of our modern Plays in their Closet, where the Morallity must be Devilish Instructive.â€”But I must be gone; here comes the 'Squire.
