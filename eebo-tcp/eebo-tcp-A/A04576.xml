         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Almighty God: viz. the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Way,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> the

            <p>And this is <hi>Dauids</hi> ten-stringed Lute, wherewith
he did solace himselfe: and in euery one of these ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
he touched one of these strings. Neither is this
to be thought any absurd tautalogie, or idle repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that these words are so often repeated in this
Psalme, and one of them found in euery verse. For
it sheweth vs,<note place="margin">Arg.</note> The wonderfull affection, loue, and
zeale, that the children of God haue vnto his lawes

            <p>Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> heere, out of his loue and zeale
that way, saith, <hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
and I will keepe it vnto the end.</hi> Nay, such is his
affection to the Law of God, that he will not rest so,
but proceedeth further,<note place="margin">Verse 35.</note> 
               <hi>Direct mee in the path of thy

               <hi>Incline my heart vnto thy testimonies.</hi>
Nay more, so great is his zeale to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, that he maketh it demonstrable, with
an <hi>Ecce,</hi> demonstrable in it selfe, verse 40. <hi>Ecce,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,

the carecter <hi>Ecce</hi> vpon it, in testimonie of his great

teach; and then that he haue <hi>scientiam quid docere,</hi>
learning and knowledge what to teach. In our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent

learning to teach; and want <hi>quem,</hi> a people, &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance

            <p>Secondly, out of this word <hi>Teach,</hi> wee learne,
<hi>Ignorantiam discipuli,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct.</note> the ignorance of men in the

be taught and regenerate by the spirit of God.</p>
            <p>So ignorant was I,<note place="margin">Psalm.</note> euen as it had beene a beast before

            <p>
               <hi>So ignorant was I:</hi> There's his ignorance before

what now he is, being taught and regenerate.</p>
            <p>The naturall man cannot perceiue the things that bee of
God,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> because he iudgeth carnally.</p>
            <p>The great worthies of the world, renowned for
learning and wisdome, were farre from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Gods Law, because they were led naturally
by reason only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zeno</hi> the Athenian of <hi>Greece,</hi> and chiefe of the
Stoicks sect, which held, that vertue was the <hi>summum
bonum,</hi> and chiefest felicitie: This was good Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
and contemplatiue learning, yet it is farre from
that learning which <hi>Dauid</hi> heere desires, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and practise of Gods Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> of the Perepatetick sect, held,
that <hi>actio virtutis,</hi> not onely the knowledge, but the


<pb facs="tcp:7865:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
practise of vertue to bee their <hi>summum-bonum,</hi> and
chiefest good. This learning is excellent; for it is
practick and a morall action; yet they come short of
the knowledge of Gods Law. And therefore this is
that Philosophie which <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth vs beware of,
<hi>Take heed and beware of Philosophie:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes.</note> for this wisdome
God hath cast away, <hi>Isay 29. 14. I will destroy the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

Where is the Scribe? Where is the disputer of this world?
Hath not God made the wisdome of this world foolishnesse?</hi>
For since the world by wisdome knew not God in
the wisdome of God, it pleased God by simplenesse
of preaching to saue them that beleeue. But what
speake I of the ignorance of the naturall man? It is
<hi>Dauid</hi> heere, that is something more then a naturall
man, that desireth to be taught. In the second place
the person making request,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Teach me;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Text.</note> not an ignorant man, not a simple man,
neither a man of any low ranke, or ordinarie calling:
his regall title is, The kingly Prophet: a King, and no
lesse then a Prophet. And wisdome is requisite for
both these: for in respect he was a King, he had need
of wisdome, whereby hee might rightly sway the
sword of Iustice: but not only in this respect did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
desire to be taught, when hee said, <hi>Teach mee, O
Lord;</hi> he did not meane how he should gouerne his
Kingdome, which is very requisite; but teach mee
thy statutes; teach me this.</p>
            <p>Neither doth <hi>Dauid,</hi> that is trained vp in the


<pb facs="tcp:7865:7"/>
schoole of regeneration, onely once or twice make
this request, to be taught in the knowledge and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of Gods Law, but maketh many requests to the
same purpose. When he is come to some perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the knowledge of Gods Law, he will not heere
rest. Wherein obserue,</p>
            <p>The elect themselues,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> when they are come to some
perfection in the knowledge and practise of Gods
Law, must not heere sit downe and rest, but must
still proceed to learne and practise the way of Gods
Statutes and Lawes. <hi>Teach me, O Lord. Direct me in
the pathes of thy Commandements, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dauid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> though learned in Gods Law, yet desireth
still to bee taught, to bee instructed, to bee directed.
For hee can neuer, with his best endeuours, come to
the center and perfection of this learning. And this
serues to reprooue the carelesnesse of many both in
learning and practising the Law and word of God.</p>
            <p>Men thinke, when they can but say the Lords prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or the Creed, they are learned enough, they need
know no more, nor doe any more, but only repeat it;
no more belongeth vnto it. When but once or twice
in a yeere they heare a Sermon, and that with a cold
zeale, that it freezeth; or receiue the Lords Supper
once a yeere, to saue themselues from the danger of
the Law; it is well enough. And thus doe the poore
blinde wormes of the world deceiue themselues, and
are content with a very little learning in his law and
word, and a lesse practise in the same.</p>
            <p>The wisdome heere then is that which <hi>Paul</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 7.<note place="margin">Vse.</note>

excluded out of the schoole of Christianitie, for <hi>non

and contempt of his law. And thus much out of
the word <hi>doce,</hi> Teach me, and so let vs come vnto the
third place, which is <hi>Dauias</hi> teacher, <hi>O Lord, Teach
me, O Lord,</hi> Heere is <hi>Dauids</hi> teacher.</p>
            <p>Heere is the teacher of teachers, and pastor of

            <p>The dignitie and excellency of the office of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

            </p>
            <p>It is called <hi>euangelium regni,</hi>

the Scepter of the kingdome is a right Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
theres the power and dignitie of the Gospell.
What neede I stand to shew how the worthies of
the world haue graced this calling of preaching the
Gospel? <hi>Dauid</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> chose to be stiled a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.
<hi>Salomon</hi> the wise commonly called a preacher.
Nay, our Sauiour Christ himself, heauens only <hi>Phoenix,</hi>
and earthes great Satrapasse, he which hath the

               <note place="margin">Mat. 9.</note> this great office and worke of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Gospell.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Instruction.</note> the necessity of teaching and preaching
is heere commended vnto vs, <hi>Teach me O Lord,</hi> for if
this had not beene verie needfull, why would Christ
himselfe take vpon him this weightie and painefull
office. So necessarie, as nothing is more necessarie,
then <hi>hoc vnum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 41.</note> this one thing. <hi>Martha, Martha,</hi> saith


<pb facs="tcp:7865:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our Sauiour Christ, thou art carefull about many
things, verily one thing is needfull. <hi>Mary</hi> hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
the best part which shall not bee taken from
her.</p>
            <p>If such then be the dignitie and necessitie of this
office of teaching &amp; preaching the Gospel, why are
yet the ministers therof so contemned &amp; despised?
why are they so traduced and slandered? why is the
dignitie of the church so indignified &amp; disgraced the
orders and constitutions depraued &amp; violated, her
liuings and maintenance so cut and mangled.</p>
            <p>That Prophecie of <hi>Esay</hi> concerning the Church,
is now come to passe.<note place="margin">Esay. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>And the Daughter of Sion shall
bee left like a cottage in a Vineyard, like a lodge in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of cucumbers like a besieged Citie.</hi> This poore
daughter the church is left indeed bare enough,
now without dowrie, without gifts, without golde,
she is robbed of all these. As <hi>Iacob</hi> said, Me haue yee
robbed of my Children, <hi>Ioseph</hi> is away, and <hi>Simeon</hi> is
away, &amp; wil ye take <hi>Beniamin</hi> also? al those things are
against me, so may the Church say: Me haue ye rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
my maintenance is away, my props and pillars
decay, our greene pastures and rich medowes are
drowned by sacriledge, all these things are against
me, ye haue robbed me. As the Israelites sometimes
robbed the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> they borrowed Iewels of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and Iewels of gold, but they neuer meant to pay
them againe,<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 2.</note> &amp; they robbed the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> so is the
church robbed &amp; cousened of her maintenance, they
haue borrowed our Church-liuings, our Siluer and
golde, our Iewels, but how? as the <hi>Israelites</hi> borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb facs="tcp:7865:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> neuer meaning to pay them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
but to rob the Church. It is to be feared that
the contempt of <hi>Sion,</hi> and neglect of her prophets
and preachers will be the ruine of the church, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
of religion, decaying of learning, &amp;c. and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacie
in faith and grace, and a flatte relapse from
Christ and his Gospell.</p>
            <p>The second branch of this doctrine is, by what
meanes God teacheth vs. <hi>Teach me O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meanes whereby God teacheth vs is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,<note place="margin">A threefolde meanes.</note>
               <hi>verbo</hi> by his word, secondly <hi>benedictionibus,</hi> by his
blessings. Thirdly, <hi>afflictionibus,</hi> by punishment and
afflictions.</p>
            <p>1. First, he teacheth vs by his word, how to walke
in the way of his statutes, <hi>Psalme. 119. Thy word is a
lanthorne to my feete, and a light vnto my pathes.</hi> And
verse. 9. <hi>Where with all shall a young man clense his way,
euen by ruling himselfe after thy word.</hi> Hence it is called
a staffe to walke with, a buckler to defend vs against
the incursions of our spirituall enemies, a light to
giue light vnto our pathes, that wee stumble not in
the darkenesse of our owne ignorance. So hath God
taught vs in this land by his word, and yet doth still
teach vs, though he see little fruits of his labours, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
fruits of his teaching, little fruits of his word, hee
hath not thus dealt with other nations, neither haue
the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowledge of his waies other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue
not this teaching: other nations haue not this word
of life founded vnto them: other nations haue not
these cleere and pure chrystal waters of life, without
corruption of Heresie, as wee haue, and yet wee are


<pb facs="tcp:7865:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as backward as they in bringing forth fruites, and as
barbarous in our life &amp; conuersation, as a number of
the heathen which haue not knowne his name.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Secondly, God teacheth vs by his blessings,
to incourage vs to walke in his waies and statutes. So
he did the</hi> Israelits. Deut. 8. 6. Therefore thou shalt keepe
the commandements of the Lord thy God, and walke in his
waies, and feare him. For the Lord thy God bringeth thee
into a good land, a land wherein are riuers of waters, and
fountaines, and springs that flow out of vallies and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
a land of wheate and barly, and of Vineyards, fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees
and Pomegranets, a land of Oyle, Oliue and honie. A
land wherein thou shalt eat bread without sacrifice, neither
shalt thou lacke any thing therein. A land whose stones
are yron, and out of whose mountaines thou shalt dig brasse.
<hi>These are blessings sufficient to incourage the</hi> Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
<hi>to walk in his waies, for heere is</hi> plenitudo diuitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
<hi>the fulnesse of riches. God doth not giue vs his
blessings sparingly vnto his children, but</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>richly
abundantly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We cannot say of God, as <hi>Esaw</hi> said of his Father
<hi>Isaac,</hi> father hast thou but one blessing blesse me also
O my father, I am thy son <hi>Esaw,</hi> for he hath many
blessings in store for his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of his fulnes haue we
all receiued. There's his <hi>manus plena,</hi> his full hand,
which he openeth and filleth all thinges with plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes.
Then he protecteth &amp; keepeth his children,
theres his <hi>manus extensa,</hi> his stretched out arme to
defend them from their enemies. And with all these
blessings, and more then all those hath God blessed
vs, and they are indeed truely said his blessings, if we


<pb facs="tcp:7865:11"/>
be taught by them to walke in his waies and keepe
his statutes. <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith God) <hi>thou shalt keepe
my commandements:</hi> the cause is set downe in, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
wherefore? <hi>because the Lord thy God bringeth thee

Gods people the <hi>Israelites,</hi> euer any more cause by
his blessings,<note place="margin">Deut. 8 7</note> to walke in his waies, then wee haue?
What had the <hi>Israelites</hi> that wee haue not? What
was there in the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of <hi>Iury,</hi> now called <hi>Palestina,</hi> that
wee haue not? they had a good land, so haue wee;
they had a land of riuers and waters, so haue wee;
they had a land of wheat and barly, so haue we; they
had a land of Vinyards, and figtrees, so haue wee.
They did eate bread without scarcitie, so do we; they
did dig iron and brasse out of their mountaines, so
doe wee. Wee are in nothing behind the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
concerning blessings, our land is machable with
theirs in euery respect, nay, before it, in respect of go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uernors;
a religious puissant Prince, a most learned &amp;
literate Clergie, moste reuerend Bishoppes, most
paineful Pastors, most careful Magistrates, in respect
of the Gospell, a land indeed of riuers, not of drops
of spirituall waters of life: a land wherein wee eate
the breade of life without scarsitie, neither doe wee
lacke any thing heerein. In respect of temporall
blessings, a land of wheat and barley, &amp;c. To be short
a land without paralell, a land wherein nothing is
wanting, but an obedient thankfull people vnto God
for this land. And with these blessings doth God in
courage vs, and by these doth he teach vs, to walk in
his paths, and commandements.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7865:11"/>
3 Thirdly God teacheth vs, <hi>afflictionibus</hi> by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
and afflictions, that wee may walke in his
pathes, &amp; keep his statutes. For when his world and
blessings will not serue to instruct vs, and teach vs,
he will teach vs by punishments &amp; by iudgements.
So Psa. <hi>Before I was troubled I went wrong, but now
haue I kept thy statutes.</hi> And these are requisite to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
vs out of the waies of ignorance and blindenes
wherein wee walke.</p>
            <p>Hath not God taught vs of late by afflictions,<note place="margin">Appli.</note> and
yet wee will not learne? hath hee not taught vs by
noisome sicknesses, by diuers diseases, and sundrie
kindes of death? hath he not taught vs, and doth he
not yet now teach vs by the fearefull sicknesse of
plague and pestilence in this Citie? when we heare a
lamentation and weeping consent of Children for
their parents, Parents for their children: Husbands
for their wiues, wiues for their husbands: Seruants
for their masters, masters for their seruants. In our
<hi>Rama,</hi> there is a voice heard of lamentation, weeping
and mourning. Mourning for this great affliction of
plague, but not mourning for our sinnes, which are
the cause of these plagues.</p>
            <p>Wil you therfore know the cause of these plagues,
<hi>Dauid</hi> telleth you. Foolish men are plagued for their
sinnes, and because of their wickednesse. Heere is the
cause of our plagues which wee consider not. It is
our sinnes then that plague vs, not God; It is our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigniall
sinnes, our actuall sinnes, our heinous sinnes,
our bloudie sinnes, our cruell sinnes, our crying
sinnes, that crie out to God, that in his iustice and


<pb facs="tcp:7865:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
iudgements he cannot but plague vs. It is our pride
and enuie one against another: our gluttonie and
drunkennesse, our whoredom and adulterie, our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse
and crueltie, our prophanation of the
Sabbath day, with other the like sinnes: these are the
cause of our plagues. And so long as we continue in
sinne, God will continue his plagues, stil to continue
in these sinnes of pride, couetousnesse, whoredome
and drunkennesse. These are <hi>peccata clamantia</hi> and
<hi>vastantia conscientiam.</hi> These are crying sinnes, hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
sinnes, and a man knoweth not where to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before him, when God shall summon him by
death to appeare before him, so that to sinne is of
weakenesse, but to continue and perseuer in sinne,
this is not onelie a sinfull life, but a life of sinne it
selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If therefore wee will not learne by his word, nor
by his blessings, he will teach vs by his afflictions and
plagues. He will cause his Angell to strike, yet more
then seauenty thousand of the plague and pestilence,
as he hath done alreadie in this Citie.</hi> Nay, hee will
stretch ouer Ierusalem,<note place="margin">4. King. 21. 13.</note> the line of Samaria, &amp; the plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
of the house of Ahab, he will wipe Ierusalem as a man
wipeth a dish, and turneth it vpside downe, hee will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the remnant of his inheritance, because wee haue done
euill in his sight, and prouoked him to anger, because wee
haue forsaken the Lord our God, that hath so louingly taught
vs by his word and blessing, and yet wee will receiue no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
<note place="margin">Esay. 1.</note> but stil continue a sinful people, a people lade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with
iniquitie, a seed of the wicked, corrupt children which haue
forsaken the Lord, and prouoked the holy one of Israell to


<pb facs="tcp:7865:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
anger, <hi>these are the meanes wherby God teacheth vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither hath hee taught vs onlie by this late sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of plague and mortalitie,<note place="margin">He teacheth vs by this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate raine.</note> for this is the easiest
punishment. And <hi>Dauid</hi> chose this, to fal in the hand
of God, but also by these late inundations of raine &amp;
water, wherby he seemeth so angrie with the world,
that were it not for his promise, hee would vtterlie
drowne it again, such is the wickednesse of men, and
the thoughts of their hearts inclining to euil, that it
euen repenteth God that hee made man. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. And
though hee hath made him, yet he will destroy him
again with waters. Neither doth he send this plague
of raine and waters at such time of the yeare when
it should refresh and comfort the drie earth, and do
good vnto men, but euen in the time of Haruest,
when we should reape and receiue the fruits of the
earth. Whereby as wee haue made frustrate his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of receiuing fruits at our hands of his
word: so hath hee made frustrate our expectation
of receiuing the fruites of the earth, whereby I
say, hee seemeth so, more then much mooued with
our sinnes, that hee threatneth by these raines and
waters, that which is farre worse then a plague, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
a famine, the most greeuous punishment of all
punishments. When as ten acars of vines shall giue
but a quart, and thirtie bushels of seed shall giue but
an Epha, that he should breake the staffe of bread in
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and that wee should eate bread by weight,
and drinke water with astonishment.<note place="margin">Esay. 5.</note> That we should
haue cleannesse of teeth in all our Cities,<note place="margin">Amos. 4.</note> and scars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of bread in all our Coasts. For so did the Lord
when he would destroy <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezech. 4.</note> stretch out his own


<pb facs="tcp:7865:13"/>
hand against it, by a famin to ouerthrow it, when the
father did catch meat from the Son, the sonne from
the Father: the mother from her childe, the childe
from the mother: the husband from the wife, the
wife from the husband: and their Children died, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
bread betweene their teeth. Our sinnes I say,
haue deserued these plagues, this horrible intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
plague of famin. The sicknesse of plague and
pestilence is a great and greeuous punishment, when
we are suddenly strucken, that our friends forsake vs,
and are oftentimes suddenlie called away before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
The sword of our enemies is a greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
when we should flie before our enemies,
they pursuing vs with swords in their hands to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
vs, when in vaine we should cry out to our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse
murderers to saue our liues, the liues of our
wiues and children, when there is no iot of mercie,
or compassion in them, but drawe out their swords
and sheath them in our bodies, the bodies of our
Sonnes and of our Daughters, but the rod of famine
doth farre exceed all these, and passeth the degree
of admiration. Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vs therefore by our timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
preuent these plagues, and leaue when
God teacheth vs by these plagues and punishments
to walke in his waies.</p>
            <p>And thus wee haue heard by what meanes God
teacheth vs, by his word, by his blessings, and by his
afflictions, and also who is our teacher, euen the
Lord God himselfe, God the Father, God the sonne,
and God the holy Ghost, which spake by the mouth
of all his prophets, since the world began. <hi>Teach mee


<pb facs="tcp:7865:13"/>
O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have told you of some teachers, &amp; yet I haue not
shewed you all, I haue shewed you <hi>Dauids</hi> teacher,
who it is, the Lord God is the elects teacher. This is
the best teacher, and it shall be very necessarie for vs
to know the worst teacher also, that wee may auoide
his schoole, and take heede of his Doctrine.</p>
            <p>As therefore God teacheth the Elect his schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
so the deuill that olde serpent, and sathan teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the wicked his schollers most subtilly and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
to beguile and deceiue them.</p>
            <p>And his teaching he did begin betimes, euen with
our parents in Paradice in the beginning, anon after
God had begun to teach our parents the law, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
he snatched away that doctrin out of their hearts
and insteed thereof taught them another pernitious
lesson and doctrine, to their owne woe and miserie,
and ruine of themselues and their whole issue. And
like a most cunning teacher, that hee might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the minde and disposition of his scholler, how
shee stood affected to apprehend his Doctrine, hee
subtillie mooued a question, yea, hath God said, yee
shall not eate of euerie tree in the Garden, by moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of which question he had a wonderfull aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
aud had laied a snare to entrap her howsoeuer:
for if he found her affection but lame and halting in
the Commandement of God, not absolutely and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
affected thereunto, then hee was readie by
his suggestion and instinct, to make her giue as
much credit to a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, <hi>Ye shall not die at all,</hi>
and thereunto added pleasing obiects, the beauty of


<pb facs="tcp:7865:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Apple, and that they should be Gods, and know
good and euill.</p>
            <p>Thus the Deuill teacheth cunningly, subtilly, and
powerfully: he is an ancient teacher of long standing
therfore he teacheth cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly. He is a Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: theres
his subtiltie: he is a Dragon: theres his crueltie. Hee

            <p>He is a cunning <hi>Arithmetician,</hi> he can number our
vertues thirteene for twelue, and thereby puffe vs vp
in pride and ambition. So he did the Pharisie, I am
not as other men are, extortioners, vniust, or as this
Publican. I fast twice in the weeke, I giue tithe of all
that I possesse. Nay, he can number our sinnes also, &amp;
set them downe all for ciphers, he will tell the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
whoredom, pride, enuie, they are set down
all for ciphers, tush, they are nothing. And when our
sinnes are increased, that they oppresse our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
then he will ad one figure vnto those ciphers,
and then the sinnes are on the other side innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
intollerable, impardonable. So hee dealt with

is to shew you his Disciples who they are, and
they are many, foure hundred false Prophets for one
true <hi>Michea.</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. King 22.</note> Now therfore the Lord hath put a lying

his heart there is no God, for when there is no sence
and feeling in his heart and conscience of sinne,
which commeth by the transgression of the Law, he
denieth the law of God, hee that denieth the law of
God, denieth also the Lawgiuer God himselfe. And
so the foole hath said in his heart there is no GOD.

secretly had read to <hi>Alexander;</hi> and so by publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of them, would make these arts common.
I doe not thinke, but that Antichristian <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> is now as angry with those his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
for publishing these bookes, which heere in
this place were of late fired, and burned before your
eies, (as was very fit, that such light stuffe, lighter
then chaffe it selfe, should bee burned) bookes I say
containing Acroamaticall, enigmatical, diabolicall,
super-diabolical positions. For, what doe you think
of them? doe you thinke them to be written onely
as an answer to the booke of our learned, and truely
religious Soueraigne, which by him of late was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
intituled, <hi>An Apologie for the defence of the Oath
of Allegiance?</hi> no: For therein his Maiestie may yet
trulie say as <hi>Cesar</hi> said of <hi>Pompie:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plut. in vita Caesar.</note> 
               <hi>The victorie had
beene our enemies, if they had had a Captaine that could
haue told how to ouercome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7865:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Or what doe yee thinke of these bookes? doe you
thinke them to be written onely, to depraue the state
of our Church, to disquiet the peace of our <hi>Sion,</hi> to
traduce &amp; slander her Ministers, to seduce her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
this were hard dealing enough, or doe you
thinke them to be written, onely as a quib to our
Gentlemen, a scoffe to our Nobles and worthies of
<hi>Israel,</hi> and that which is most of all in derision of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi>
own selfe, his second selfe, his whole race royal?
not onely so, for these diuelish positions, and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
<hi>Querries</hi> as they tearme them, were flat
blasphemie against the holie spirit of God. Hee that
offendeth the king, may sometimes be pardoned, nay
he that sinneth against the Father and the Son may
be forgiuen, but hee that sinneth against the holy
Ghost, shall not be forgiuen. And what now can be
thought of these base pasquils, and most idle asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
contriued without wit, without art, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
without iudgement, without the feare of
God, without respect to his ordinance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
head, without taile? It is much like the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
which the <hi>Romanes</hi> sent to <hi>Bythinia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Marc. Cato.</note> who hauing
chosen three Embassadors, the one of them hauing
the gout in his feet, the other his head full of great
cuts &amp; gasps, the third being but a foole, <hi>Cato</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
said, That the <hi>Romanes</hi> had sent an Embassage,
that had neither feet, head, nor heart. And their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage
by their bookes is much like vnto that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feet, it standeth not by reason without head, it
wanteth iudgement, without heart it wanteth vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7865:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And to helpe to grace this their Embassage, they
sent this shallow weake stuffe in as weak a vessell, by
a woman forsooth, shee must haue the portage of
these bookes.</p>
            <p>It is reported by <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plut, in vita Tur. Camil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

before their Pastors, before the ordinance

whereby yee shall know these pernicious and sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sectuaries, and distinguish them from the true
children of God, are these which follow. And as
Christ said of false Prophets,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 16. 20.</note> 
               <hi>by their fruites yee shall
know them:</hi> so I say of these sectuaries, by their fruits
yee shall know them, by these notes and markes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing,
ye shall know them. And first by their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline


<pb facs="tcp:7865:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ye shall know them.</p>
            <p n="1">1 An vnchristian Discipline, not yet christened:
it wanteth a certaine name: so that if a man should
catechise these men, and aske them, <hi>what is the name
of your Discipline,</hi> they could not answer you.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A Discipline that banisheth such Bishops, as
Christ and his Apostles appointed, allowed, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A discipline that knoweth not whether her
Officers should be ecclesiasticall or lay men.</p>
            <p n="4">4 A discipline that disdaineth the ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and generall Councels.</p>
            <p n="5">5 A discipline that to serue her owne turne, wil
wrest and wring the Scriptures as a nose of wax.</p>
            <p n="6">6 A discipline that would be verie chargeable,
by reason of her traine, that must bee all maintained
by a common purse.</p>
            <p n="7">7 <hi>A discipline that giueth her Children verie
strange names in Baptism, instead of</hi> Robert, Thomas
<hi>and</hi> Iohn, The Lord is neere: More tryall, Reformation,

More fruit, Dust, &amp;c. <hi>Names in our English
phrase not verie vsuall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8 A discipline that oppugneth the authoritie
of Princes in causes Ecclesiasticall, and heerein they
ioyne with the Papists.</p>
            <p n="9">9 A discipline that turneth all things vpside
downe, Churches into chambers: Bishops into
Snidicks, and superintendents: Ministers into Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and bench Presbyterians, and that if they might
be suffered with their discipline, would make a new


<pb facs="tcp:7865:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
metamorphosis of the world, and would with <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
Sonne to <hi>Phoebus,</hi> if they might haue the guiding
of the chariot of the Sun ouerthrow the same, and
burne the whole world, and set all on fire with their
Discipline. Therfore by their discipline ye shal know
them.</p>
            <p>2 Secondly, by this badge or marke ye shall know
them: they are alwaies in the optatiue moode, and
are knowne by the signe <hi>vtinam,</hi> I would to God
things were otherwise: I would to God the church
were reformed, her orders and constitutions alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
but it were great pitie they should be in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall
moode, and haue power to doe it.</p>
            <p>3 Thirdly, they haue inward markes, whereby ye
shall know them.</p>
            <p>1 They are not a little malitious: they lighten
and thunder malice against all that will not bee of
their ranke and discipline, and with the Basaliske
would kill them with their lookes if they could,
therefore by their malice and enuie yee shall know
them.</p>
            <p>2 Secondly, ye shal know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this mark, that they
are not a little mouthie and clamorous to traduce
&amp; slander other men. They are set on fire, their teeth
are Speares and Arrowes, and their tongue a sharp
sword.</p>
            <p>3 Thirdly, ye shal know them by this mark, that
they are verie busie-bodies in such matters as doe
not sometimes appertain vnto them. They will with
the Pharisies find fault with the disciples of Christ, if
it be but for the rubbing of the eares of Corne, or for


<pb facs="tcp:7865:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not washing their hands, this <hi>cacoethes</hi> or euill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
is most apparant in them.</p>
            <p>4 Fourthly, by this marke ye shall know them:
they will speake euill of their <hi>Pastors</hi> and teachers
that are regular, and are not of their stampe. Nay,
they will conspire against them, and this the author
heereof may say, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, <hi>Saue me O Lord, from
the conspiracie of the wicked, and saue me from the insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the wicked doers, which haue whet their tongue
like a sword, and shoot out their Arrowes euen bitter
words.</hi> By their slanders and conspiracies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations
ye shall know them.</p>
            <p>5 Fiftly, ye shall know them by this mark: they
smell of <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> and heerein they sympatnize and
symbolize with the deuill himselfe. <hi>Apud Indos aes
adeo lucidum, &amp;c.</hi> Amongst the Indians there is a kind
of brasse of that claritie and perfect golden colour,
that it can by no meanes be discerned from golde,
but by the smell thereof onely. These seditious sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries
much resemble that brasse, for they set such a
golden colour vpon themselues of singularitie and
purenesse, that by no other meanes they can be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
from the true children of GOD, but by the
smell onely of these aforenamed defects of malice,
slander, conspiracy and hypocrisie, therfore by their
smell ye shall know them.</p>
            <p>Therfore I would not haue you mistake me here,
that I doe heere condemne the godly zealous man,
which tenderly loueth Gods word, and walketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightlie
in his waies with <hi>Dauid,</hi> for by these afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
markes ye shall know them, and by these marks


<pb facs="tcp:7865:21"/>
ye may easilie distinguish and put difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the vpright, religious, and zealous man, and
the masterlesse, seditious, and pernitious sectuarie:
These marks &amp; characters are stamped vpon them,
and make them demonstrable to the world: these are
principles and first heads of disorder, and breake the
parke-pale of the gouernment of our church: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe I hereby disswade any from hearing any
mans Sermons whom they affect, for heare all men
that preach the Gospell as much as thou maiest: <hi>He
that refuseth to heare his praier shall bee abhominable,</hi> but
to this end, partly because a number of the laitie, the
roes and hinds of the field, which will start aside at
the cracking of a sticke, will refuse their owne parish
Churches, and to heare their own Pastors preach,
be they neuer so learned or well habited in speech,
because they weare a Surplisse, and make a crosse vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a childe, and wil runne after and get them a heap
of teachers that speake euill of them that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie:
these are truce-breakers, false accusers, &amp;
intemperate fierce despisers of them that are good:
that wil raile against Bishops, and curtaile the title of
kings, as in their praiers oftentimes, as is most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.
And partly because many of my brethren of the
ministerie, that haue excellent parts, and gifts, and
are called into the Lords haruest, to labour in the
Vineyard in their callings, will notwithstanding, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then they wil weare a Surplisse, or submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to authoritie commanded by Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
leaue that <hi>magnum opus,</hi> that great worke of
preaching the Gospel vndone, yea, vtterly disclaime


<pb facs="tcp:7865:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and renounce their callings, to the hindrance of the
Gospell; and vndoing of themselues, and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.
Alas,<note place="margin">Mat, 27.</note> Christ which preached heere on earth,
rather then he would disclaime his calling, of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Gospel, would notwithstanding his purple
robe, his Crowne of Thornes, his Scepter of reede,
that was imposed vpon him in derision, preach the
Gospel still.</p>
            <p>That same triple exaggeration of Christ vnto
<hi>Peter,</hi> should be me thinks a great motiue vnto all vs
of the Clergie, not to renounce this worke for any
respect. <hi>Peter louest thou me? Peter louest thou mee? &amp;c.</hi>
and it is wel noted by one, that <hi>Peter</hi> was sorrie that
Christ should aske him the third time, <hi>Peter louest
thou mee:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 21, 17.</note> 
               <hi>Simon Peter answered, Lord, thou knowest all
things, thou knowest that I loue thee.</hi> And shall not we
be as sorrie that Christ shall so often taxe vs by his
loue, and thereby inioyne vs vnto the exigence of
this dutie, that we haue notwithstanding left it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done?
Let vs not therfore, my brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I beseech you
in the fear of God, be so peruerse vnto god &amp; his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
but let vs with <hi>Dauid</hi> learn to be in the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiue
case, and to come after the verbe, as hee did
when he said, <hi>Teach me O Lord.</hi> And let vs not leaue
this work of preaching the Gospell for any respect,
and renounce our callings, &amp; offend our good God,
and cause an amazednesse in the Roes and Hindes of
the field, an apostasie and relapse in the ignorant &amp;
simple, and heereby let them stand stock-stil in piety,
vertue and godlinesse, but be rather all of one mind,

the ordinance of God, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, <hi>Teach me o Lord,</hi>
follow the verbe, and be subiect to authoritie. And
so let vs come to the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part which is the promise
<hi>I will keep it with my whole heart.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doctr.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Promises are made either <hi>absolutè</hi> or <hi>respectinè:</hi>
as we distinguish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either absolutely or conditionally,
<hi>Dauid</hi> doth not make his promise absolutely but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally:
he saith not I will learne and keepe thy law
without teaching,<note place="margin">Text.</note> but first teach me, and then I will
learne &amp; keepe it, wherein out of this copulatiue <hi>&amp;,
and,</hi>

            <p>Grace alwaies hath the precedencie, and goeth
before good workes and righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>We cannot walke in the lawes of God before we
bee inabled by grace. <hi>Dauid</hi> could not so much as
make a promise of keeping the Law of God before
the Lord had taught him. <hi>Paul</hi> could not preach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was called by grace,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> and therefore knowing
the necessitie and vtilitie heereof in all his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
<note place="margin">Peter Martir.</note> first wisheth them grace, <hi>Grace be with you and
peace, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 For there is <hi>gratia praecedens,</hi> or <hi>operans,</hi> a grace
going before, that worketh in vs, and bringeth vs
from that blindenesse and ignorance, that is in vs by
our originall corruption, to the schoole of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp; true knowledge of Christ. And of this grace
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Not I, but grace that was in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Then there is <hi>gratia cooperans,</hi> a grace wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
together with our wills, and our wils working
together with grace. And this is that which <hi>Paul</hi>
speaketh of, <hi>And his grace which was in me, was not in
vaine;</hi> not in vaine, as it was giuen, not in vaine, as it


<pb facs="tcp:7865:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was receiued; for euen as the raine falling on the
earth mollifieth the same, and both worke to bring
forth fruits, so the grace of God being distilled into
the will and minde of man, worke both together to
the bringing foorth of the fruites of righteousnesse.
So <hi>Dauid</hi> heere, <hi>Teach me O Lord, instill this grace into
my heart, and I wil keep thy lawes, yea with my whole heart.</hi>
Nay, God goeth a step further with his Children by
grace: for there is</p>
            <p>3 Gratia preueniens, <hi>a preuenting grace.</hi> Psalm. 82.
His grace shall preuent mee. <hi>So in</hi> Gen. 20. 6. I kept thee
from doing this thing: &amp; that thou shouldest not sin against
me, therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. <hi>God doth
preuent his children from sinne: nay, there is more,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 <hi>Gratia subsequens,</hi> a subsequenting grace <hi>Ps. 49

he shall set a crowne of pure golde vpon my head.
And thus much out of the copulatiue, <hi>And,</hi> which
sheweth, grace goeth before righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tex.</note> Wherein for breuities sake obserue:</p>
            <p>There is in the regenerate free-wil to wil good,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> or
righteousnes, but not to perform but by grace, <hi>velle
mihi adiacet, perficere autem non inuenio.</hi> To will is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with me, but I finde not how to performe the
same. I see a law in my members, rebelling against
the law of my minde. But <hi>Dauid</hi> saith heere,
<hi>I will keepe it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Text.</note> Wherin obserue, Secondly,</p>
            <p>There is in the regenerate conditionally by grace
free-will in righteousnesse,<note place="margin">2 Doct.</note> to keep the Law of God.
<hi>I will keepe it with my whole heart, I will offer thee free-will-sacrifice,
I will praise thy name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7865:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For if there were no free-will at all in the elect, to
performe righteousnesse by grace, then were grace
giuen in vaine, and receiued in vaine, and of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
it must be granted, that men should stand still in
the waies of God, without any will or endeuour of
action at all: and let grace worke in vaine, as on
sencelesse stocks and stones. Nay rather grace beeing
giuen vs, we must bend our affections and actions to
walke in the law of God, &amp; to keep it with our whole
heart. And yet when yee haue done all this, free-will
vnto righteousnesse, euen in the elect, <hi>est manca,</hi> mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and weake. <hi>Caro habet suam voluntatem etiam in
pijs,</hi> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, the flesh still rebelleth against
the spirit, so long as this vnion standeth, and vntill it
be separated by death. So we come vnto the third
place,<note place="margin">Text.</note> wherein we obserue the thing promised.</p>
            <p>I will keepe it.</p>
            <p>And heere may a question be demanded,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> whether
the regenerate (for of them wee speake in this place)
may keepe the law of God or not.</p>
            <p>The answer must be with this distinction.</p>
            <p>1 It is one thing to keepe the law of God, <hi>perfectè</hi>
absolutely, perfectlie, as the law requireth.</p>
            <p>2 And it is another thing to keepe the law of God
<hi>respectiuè,</hi> respectiuely, to the vttermost of a mans
power, and with all his indeuour, to haue respect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the law of God, to keepe it so neere as he can.</p>
            <p>The first way none can keepe it, no man hath kept
it, but onely <hi>vnus Christus,</hi> God and man, none but
Christ can keepe the law perfectly, as the law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
perfect obedience vnto iustification, but onely


<pb facs="tcp:7865:24"/>
Christ, he hath fulfilled it. In the beginning of the
booke it is written of me, that I should fulfill thy will
O God, I am content to doe it, yea, thy law is within
my brest. And in Christ is God well pleased. Matt. 3.
which he would not haue beene, if hee had not kept
his law perfectly.</p>
            <p>The second way, wee may keepe the law of God,
that is, haue respect vnto the law of God, vnto the
vttermost of our power, and with all our endeuour to
keepe the same.</p>
            <p>Dauid <hi>saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 33. Luke. 1.</note> I will keepe it vnto the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were both iust before God
and walked in his ordinance and commandements
for to doe them. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I haue fought the good fight;
I haue kept the faith; I haue fulfilled my course, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
there is a crowne of glorie laide vp for me:</hi> yet none
of all these did keepe the law so perfectly as the law
required, to iustifie themselues by the law. But they
kept the law of God, with that respect as <hi>Dauid</hi> had
vnto the law of God. <hi>Psal. 119. I will haue a respect vnto
all thy commandements.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Solutio.</note> And so we are said to keep the
law of God.</p>
            <p>If a master set his Scholler a coppie excellently
written, and bid his scholler doe as hee hath done, if
the same scholler hath respect vnto his masters cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,
and frame the proportion of his letters so neere
as he can to his masters coppie, the same scholler
doth as his Master bid him, and as well as he can, and
so is said to keepe his Masters commandement.</p>
            <p>Euen so wee beloued, God hath set vs a law to
keepe, and biddeth vs keepe it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 6. If wee doe


<pb facs="tcp:7865:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
keepe it as well as we can with al our indeuours, and
haue respect vnto it, wee are saide to keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
though we cannot keep them in such
perfection, as our Master Christ hath done: hee is so
excellent, so perfit, that we must still learne of him, &amp;
yet come short of him.</p>
            <p>So then because we cannot keepe the law of God
so perfectly as the law requireth,<note place="margin">Conclusio. Argumenti</note> shall wee not keepe
it at al? <hi>absit,</hi> God forbid.</p>
            <p>If our earthlie parents command vs to trauell vp
an exceeding high mountaine,<note place="margin">Sl.</note> whose top we cannot
attaine vnto shall we not therfore indenour to climb
vp at all? shal we not goe vp as farre as we can? God
forbid.</p>
            <p>Because in <hi>Isaac</hi> shall thy seede bee blessed,<note place="margin">Sl.</note> which
cannot be if <hi>Isaac</hi> be slaine, shall not <hi>Abraham</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
keepe the commandement of God, and doe his
indeuour to performe the comandement by offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vp his sonne <hi>Isaac?</hi> God forbid: Looke thou to
the commandement of God aboue all respects, and
doe thy indeuour to keep his law, and haue a respect
to keepe it, and this is that which God requireth at
thy hands.<note place="margin">August.</note> 
               <hi>Si quod possimus agamus, caetera peragat Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus.</hi>
If we indeuour and doe what we can to keepe
the law of God, what shal be defectiue in vs, Christ
will supply by his perfectnesse and righteousnes. And
this is <hi>Dauids</hi> meaning, when he saith, <hi>I will keepe thy
law,</hi> nay, hee must also perseuer in this, and therefore
he saith,</p>
            <p>I will keepe it vnto the end.<note place="margin">Text.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Heere is the continuance and time limited of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:7865:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
promise in keeping the law of God: first he will
keepe it, then vnto the end,</p>
            <p>Not for an houre, or a day, or a yeare, but <hi>ad finem
vsque,</hi> theres the time limited, so long as our time is
limited. Wherein obserue.</p>
            <p>We must goe on stil,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> proceed stil, continne, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
and perseuer in the waies of God, and a sanctified
life, <hi>ad finem vsque,</hi> vnto the end,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>I will keepe it vnto the end.</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi>
But continue thou vnto the end,<note place="margin">2 Tim 3. 14.</note> was his charge vnto
<hi>Timothie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 8. 37.</note> And our sauiour Christ saith, <hi>If ye continue
in my word, ye are my Disciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What shal it profit a Marchant to trauell a long
voyage, and to make ship-wracke in the Hauen? Euen
so, what shal it profit a man to liue a vertuous life
a while,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> and when he should enter into the hauen of
rest, make ship-wracke of faith and a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
            <p>Hence are all Apostates to be reprooued that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
in grace,<note place="margin">Instruction</note> and through the pleasures and treasures
of the world, fall to relapse from a Christian life,
that Christ and his Gospell hath no power or place
in them at all. I doe not speake of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
which is absolutely to deny Christ the Sonne of
God, and Sauiour of the world, but of an Apostasie
of Christians, that in the beginning put on Christ in
baptisme, and vtterly disclaim and renounce a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
life afterwards, or while they confesse Christ in
word and profession, deny him in their actions.
This is not to continue vnto the end: This is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie
when they haue heard the word, presently


<pb facs="tcp:7865:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to relapse and slide from the same, like the dog vnto
his vomet, or like the Sow that was newly washed, to
wallow in the mire, but we must keep it, and that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the end, theres our continuance.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore with the time, wee haue
heard of <hi>Dauids</hi> request, and of his promise.</p>
            <p>In the request, <hi>Teach,</hi> theres his ignorance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Teach mee:</hi> theres his progresse in the
way, and continuance in his iourney.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Iehouah: O Lord:</hi> theres his teacher; for
God is the elects Teacher. And wee haue heard by
whom he teacheth, by himselfe immediately, by his
word mediately, by himselfe in his God-head, by
his Sonne in his man-hood, by his holy spirit, which
spake by the mouth of all his Prophets since the
world began. We haue heard also by what meanes
he teacheth vs: by his blessings, by his afflictions and
iudgements. So he hath taught vs, and yet still doth
teach vs. God grant we may learne his will, lest in
his wrath hee sweepe vs away by plagues and pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or by famine, which is his most grieuous rod,
to punish our inflexible stonie hearts, that will not
bend, that will not yet learne his waies. O Lord, we
confesse thou hast iust cause rather to disclaime and
renounce vs, then to receiue vs againe into thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.
Wee haue deserued, O Lord, the full viols of
thy wrath and indignation to be powred down vpon
vs. There is, o Lord, no tractablenes at al in vs vnto hy
Lawes, though thou by these thy fauourable punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
doest stil teach vs. But (gratious God) still pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to teach vs, and be gratious vnto thine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.


<pb facs="tcp:7865:26"/>
Gratious God, still proceed to teach vs thy
way, and direct vs in the paths of thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Still incline our hearts vnto thy testimonies,
and turne away our eies, lest they behold vanitie, and
quicken vs in the way. Still let thy Gospell be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
and be gratious vnto <hi>Sion,</hi> and build thou the
walles of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Still send foorth labourers into
thy haruest, and faithfull Pastors to feed their flocks.
And remooue, O Lord of hosts, all pernitious here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
and schismatikes, that seduce thy people, and
trouble thy flocke. Still bee a prop to thy Gospell,
and gouernment, heere planted in this land, against
the inundations and incursions of troublesome and
peruerse sectuaries, that too impudently and saucilie
disturbe the peace of our <hi>Sion.</hi> Let not thy faithfull
Pastors be men-pleasers, and sow pillowes to their
elbowes, to indulge them in their backwardnes and
peruersenesse: but let them truly preach thy Lawes,
and maintaine thy Gospell, thy truth, and this thy
gouernment, according to thine ordinance and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.
Let them remember what the Lord saith
vnto his Prophet:<note place="margin">Ezek. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Thou sonne of man feare them not, nor
be afraid of their lookes, but tell the house of Israel of their

prouoked the Lord God vnto anger.</hi> And giue vs al grace
