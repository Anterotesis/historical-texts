            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sir ROBERT MARSHAM,

            <p>WHat shall I say, or how excuse my Boldness,
in venturing to make so mean a present, and
without permission too; I am full of fears, tho
hitherto I have still run the same risque, and
always found my Friends so good both to forgive and accept
my worthless trifles: Nay even her Royal Highness shew'd
such a benign Condescention, as not only to pardon my am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
daring, but also Incouraged my Pen, why then shou'd
I fright my self with the apprehension of your Frowns and
Anger, when at the same time I know you to be the most
Generous and best tempered Man in the World.</p>
            <p>I look upon those that endeavour'd to discountenance this Play
as Enemys to me, not that, and had the Play been never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be so Noble to protect it, their good manners (that is, if they
understand any) tho their spite remains will make 'em cease
to Cavil at the Work, when such a worthy name Adorns
the Frontispiece. I must not trouble you with the little Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of my Foe, nor is his Name fit to be mentioned in a
Paper addrest to Sir <hi>Robert Marsham,</hi> he has Printed so
great a falshood, it deserves no Answer; yet give me leave
without being thought Impertinent or Prolix, to say I now
am pleased and treated by those who please every Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Honour to know you daily see, but that I am sure woud be
the way to offend, for you scarce hate Vice more than to
hear of your Merits, therefore I shall only add, as you are
Happy in your Lady, Happy in your Children, which are
Lovely and Hopeful as an Indulgent Parents wish can form;
Happy in Fortune, Capacious like your Soul; Happy in
