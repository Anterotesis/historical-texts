            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>But my ſervant <hi>Caleb,</hi> becauſe he had another Spirit with him, and hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me fully, him will I bring into the Land, whereinto he went, and his ſeed ſhall poſſeſſe it.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THis Verſe, and the Verſe going before, ſets forth the condition of thoſe Children of Iſrael un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two notions;</p>
            <p>Firſt, part of them God doth declare ſhould not enter into the Land of Canaan, thoſe are ſet downe in the Verſe going before, <hi>Surely they ſhall not ſee the Land of Canaan, which I ſware to their Fathers, nor ſhall any of them that provoked me ſee it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were twelve ſelect men choſen out to ſearch
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115948:3"/>
the Land of Canaan, and of thoſe twelve, eleven of them did draw back the people from going on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> ſearching the Land: Now God doth denounce th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> judgment againſt them, becauſe that they did deſigne and act againſt God, in drawing back the people, God he gave them this curſe, <hi>that they ſhould never injoy the Land of Canaan;</hi> then he proceeded to the words of the Text,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But my ſervant</hi> Caleb <hi>and his ſeed, they ſhall injoy the land,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Caleb</hi> and his ſeed did ſtand faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Lord, and the Lord then did bring them to the Land.</p>
            <p>Now the words that I ſhall pitch upon at this time is, He had a Spirit, and that Spirit was with him.</p>
            <p>In which words you may take notice of theſe foure parts:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Here is the perſons mean't, thoſe are <hi>Caleb</hi> and his ſeed.</item>
               <item>2. Here is the Leader, that is the Lord.</item>
               <item>3. Here is the qualification of this perſon, He had a Spirit, and that Spirit was with him.</item>
               <item>4. Here is the manner of his injoying this Spirit.
<list>
                     <item>1. He had it,</item>
                     <item>2. He had it with him.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the branch concerning the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that is the Lord; it is in the Originall JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, which is the moſt higheſt, the higheſt of the word is HATHO, which doth ſignifie to be, that ſignifies his beginning: there is ſo much comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115948:3"/>
in that word, that it is both the time preſent, then the time paſt, and in the future tenſe the time to come: JE, that doth ſignifie the time to be, HO the time preſent, VAH the time paſt; Now there is a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in VAH that doth ſhew the originall of all things; God he is the Originall cauſe of all things that are, and ſhall be, and have been: The next thing is the perſons mean't, that is <hi>Caleb</hi> and his ſeed, <hi>Caleb</hi> was with his ſeed, in the 13. Chap. 6. of the Tribe of Judah; <hi>Caleb</hi> the ſon of <hi>Iephumieh,</hi> he was one of theſe twelve, and the only one of them that did ſtand for God.</p>
            <p>3. The qualification of this Spirit, he had a Spirit, then he had it with him. The word is RUAN, a Spirit, it doth come from RAVER, to receive breath, the word it is ſometimes in the Maſculine, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the feminine Gender, which the Hobrewes do ſet forth much to us, and the Jewes they were uſed to put words oftentimes in the feminine Gender, as he had another Spirit, that is, he did receive a Spirit from another Spirit, from God the fountain of all Spirits: Now theſe may be underſtood the clearer by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring two Scriptures together, for it doth much concern a Chriſtian to know the operation of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Spirit of God did move upon the face of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and God ſaid let there be light, and there was light,</hi> 1 Cen. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of God did move upon the face of the water; the word which is here taken for moved, is MER HUAH: it doth come from RAHAP:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115948:4"/>
it doth ſignifie to put into, to put an influence into the ſpirit of man; now <hi>the ſame</hi> word which is uſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is uſed in the 32. Deut. 11. 12. As an Eagle ſtirreth up her neſt, fluttereth over her young, ſpreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings, ſo did the Lord alone lead him, and there was no ſtrange God with him; now I ſay, that the ſame word in <hi>Geneſis</hi> is in <hi>Deuteronomic,</hi> that doth ſignifie, it light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down: ſo now the compariſon doth lie thus, that he might bring it to our capacity, he layeth down this ſimilitude, as an Eagle; if it doth not ſit upon her eggs and keeps them warm, but lets them be cold, they will not be chickens: ſo if that the Spirit of God doth not come into the ſpirits of men, their ſpirits will be cold, and they cannot act any thing for the glory of God. So this compariſon doth ſet forth the glorious oper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ion of Gods Spirit, that the Holy Ghoſt when it doth warm the ſpirit of a man, and doth put an influence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſpirit, it doth make the ſpirit act for the glory of God; and to ſee the cleer light of God; as the Sun doth put an influence into creatures, and the fire doth warm the ſpirits of men, and revive them, ſo doth the Holy Ghoſt cauſe men to act for the peoples good, and doth inlighten their hearts.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>He had another ſpirit,</hi> that is ſet forth in theſe words, <hi>he had a ſpirit and another ſpirit with him,</hi> others they had a ſpirit, but theirs was a ſpirit of fears and of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, but he did ſtand faithfully to the Lord, he had the Spirit of God in him, to work for the glory of God and the good of his people.</p>
            <p>4. The manner of his injoying this ſpirit;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. He had it;</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:115948:4"/>
2. He had it with him.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. He had it, it did work effectually with him, it did take place in his heart, and did cauſe him to work for Gods glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He had it with him, NUMAI, it was ſuch an influence of Gods Spirit upon him, that it did make him act great things.</p>
            <p>So now the doctrine that I ſhall obſerve from theſe words are,</p>
            <p>That when the Spirit of God doth work or make an new impreſſion upon the ſpirits of men, it doth put them into a condition to act high and great things for the glorie of God, and the good of the people.</p>
            <p>I ſhall prove this out of Scripture ſaith <hi>David,</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, <hi>Create in me a clean ſpirit O God, and renew a right ſpirit within me: Pſalm</hi> 51. ver. 10. 11. 12. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did know very well, that he was altogether unable to do any of thoſe works, which God did ſet him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, without he did make his ſpirit clean.</p>
            <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence, and take not thy holy ſpirit from me: David</hi> ſtill had an eye to the Spirit of God, knowing that that muſt make him work great things for the glory of God.</p>
            <p>Ver. 12. <hi>Reſtore unto me the joy of thy ſalvation, and uphold me with thy holy ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Spirit of God ſhall reſt upon him; Eſay</hi> 11. v. 2. 3. the Spirit of Wiſdome and Underſtanding, the Spirit of Counſell and of might, the Spirit of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and fear of God; <hi>and ſhall make him of quick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in the feare of God;</hi> and he ſhall not judge after the ſight of his eyes, nor reprove after the hearing of his eares: here is the impreſſion of Gods Spirit,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115948:5"/>
which did reſt upon his heart, and it ſhall make him quick and nimble to act for God: when the Spirit of God is powerfull upon the heart of a believer, it doth make him act powerfully and couragiouſly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another comforter, Iohn</hi> 14. 16. As if he ſhould have ſaid, the Lord he hath great things for you to do, to go forth and preach ſalvation to the people, nay to lay down your lives for God, and to act very great things for the good of the people, and the glory of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In whom ye alſo trusted, after that ye heard the word of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>truth,</hi> the Goſpell of the ſalvation, in whom alſo after that you believed ye were ſealed with that holy Spirit of promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion unto the praiſe of his glory.</p>
            <p>Here now you ſee, that the ſeal is the earneſt of our inheritance, that they do act great things for the glory of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore if any man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature, old things are paſſed away, behold all things are become new:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 17.</note> If that you will be a new Creature, this Spirit of God muſt make an impreſſion in your hearts. Now all old things are paſt away; thoſe things which at the firſt we had by nature, but now by the Holy Ghoſt we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive new things; for when a man is in the ways of God, all things become new, there is a new mind, a new ſpirit, a new converſation, there is nothing of the old man in him; when before the mind was buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout earthly things, now it is buſied about heavenly things, now his converſation is in heaven.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115948:5"/>
now when the Spirit of God doth make a new impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the ſpirits of Men, it doth enable them to act great things for the glory of God, and for the good of the People: And for this, I ſhal give you ſome Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt ground or reaſon is taken from Gods decree: for, as the Lord prepared Heaven for the Elect, ſo the Lord hath decreed, that thoſe that he hath appointed for ſalvation ſhall live with him, and they ſhall have an influence of the Holy Ghoſt, I ſay, that it doth proceed from the Lords decree.</p>
            <p>Epheſ. 2. v. 10. <hi>For we are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath before or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God hath before from all Eternity ordain'd that thoſe that ſhall be ſaved ſhall live here a ſanctified and holy life, they ſhall receive an influence of the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of God ſhall make a new impreſſion upon their hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond ground is from the communion we have from Chriſt, it is impoſſible that there ſhould be ſuch a communion between the members and the head, as there is between a Saint and God; but there muſt be the Spirit of God, and that Spirit muſt work effectually between them both; there is a communion betweene him and us members, the ſame grace and glory thar he hath, the ſame hath his members.</p>
            <p>John. 17. v. 22. <hi>That the ſame glory thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they be one even as we are one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is ſuch a communion between Chriſt and his members, that the glory which God hath given him, the ſame he hath given them; therefore they muſt get
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115948:6"/>
grace here, that they may live the life of a gracious Chriſtian: for, it is begun here, and it ſhall be perfected when they come to glory hereafter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third ground is from the operation of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, for, thoſe that have not the Spirit of God within them, they are none of his: thoſe upon whoſe hearts the Holy Ghoſt doth not make an impreſſion, they have no right to Heaven, nor to any of the glory that God hath prepared for his Children.</p>
            <p>Rom. 8. v. 11. <hi>But if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead be in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is in vaine for any man to think that he doth write in the waies of God, if that there be no influence of the Holy Ghoſt that makes an impreſſion in his heart.</p>
            <p>Now I will ſpeak a word or two for application:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. For Reproofe.</item>
               <item>2. Inſtruction.</item>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Is it ſo, that the Spirit of God when that it does make  an impreſſion upon the ſpirits of men, it doth carry them on to act great things for the glory of God? Then in the firſt place this muſt ſerve</p>
            <p n="1">1. To reprove thoſe that doe make a ſtright account of it, and low eſteem of it, inſomuch that for any other temporall thing they will worke night and day for it, but ſo ſlack for my heavenly matter, and in the waies to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115948:6"/>
be acquainted with God and Heaven, that they doe caſt it behind their backs, they make no account of leaving the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another ſort are to be reproved, that though they could wiſh that they might go to Heaven and be ſaved, yet they are drawn back by ſome Earthly Creature, and by ſome ſinne or other, ſo that they are mighty ſlack to get communion with Chriſt, they are ſo much in love with the World and Earthly things that they cannot hardly leave it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are much to be reproved that have had a great diſcovery of God in their ſoules, who were once inlightned by the word of God, who have taſted of the good word, who have had knowledge of God, and now doe turne their backs againe upon the word of God, with the Dog to the vomit, and with the Swine to the mire.</p>
            <p>Jer. 13. v. 15, 16. <hi>Becauſe they have turned from me, my ſoule ſhall have no pleaſure, ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>When thoſe that did profeſſe the name of Chriſt, thoſe that are of the Church, and thoſe that are called, thoſe that have gone farre in the waies of Religion, and now fall back; this doth make them odious in the ſight of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Heb. 6. v. 4, 5, 6. <hi>It is impoſsible who were once enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and have taſted of the heavenly gifts, and were made Partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have caſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they ſhall fall away to renew them againe to repentance, ſeeing they Crucifie to themſelves the Sonne of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:115948:7"/>
When they have gone ſo farre in the waies of God and Religion, that have been enlightned and have taſted the good word, and the power of God, it is an impoſſible thing for to renew thoſe Men to repentance, when that they doe Crucifie the Lord Jeſus: but now I would have you to know that it is not impoſſible, for there is nothing impoſsible to him; but yet if that God will do it, he muſt doe a great worke to bring them againe that are once gone.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another ſort are to be reproved who will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Gods Servants to have communion with the Saints, who had rather blot the Name of God out of their minds, than God ſhould work ſuch a worke upon them, that they ſhould look into their Conſciences, no, their Conſciences they are ſeared with a hot iron, and they cannot indure to behold and looke into their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and they cannot indure that the ſpirit of God ſhould make any impreſſion in their ſoules.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It muſt ſerve to reprove them that doe hinder o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from having co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with God, either by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to ſinne, or hinder them in the worke of God, ſuch as doe deceive the Children of God becauſe that they are conſcientious in their waies, and doe ſtrive to lead their lives in the feare of God, and to lead a good life.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now the ſecond thing is for Inſtruction, is it ſo that the Spirit of God working ſo upon the ſpirits of Men,  doe put them into a condition to worke great things for Gods glory? take you heed that you doe not quench the Spirit of God: Do you find the Holy Ghoſt warme

               </gap> than if you doe quench it, you know not when ever you may have ſuch an opportunity againe or no: take you heed that you doe never quench theſe motions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take you heed that you doe not grieve the Spirit of God, as thoſe that are about to commit any ſinne; if it be Drunkenneſſe, or whoredome, or any ſuch like ſin, when the Spirit of God doth ſmite your heart for it, and tells you that that is the way to Hell, take heed that you doe not grieve it then, when it doth ſtrive to draw you off from doing ſuch a ſinne, and ſtrives to ſhew you the right way to Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take heed that you doe not trample the Spirit of God under your feet; take heed that when the paſſion comes, it doth not carry you on to act any great and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate ſin againſt the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Heb. 10. v. 28, 29. <hi>He that did deſpiſe Moſes Law died without mercy, under two or three Witneſſes; how much ſeverer puniſhment, think ye, he ſhall be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of, who hath trodden under foot the Soune of God, and bath counted the bloud of the Covenani, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing; and hash done deſpite to the Spirit of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If that a man for the breach of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law with two or three Witneſſes ſhould ſuffer death; what doe you thinke a man at the great Day of Judgement ſhall ſuffer for the ſhedding the Spirit of Grace under foot?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let this ſtirre up your affection to an holy duty, be in love with the Word of God, with the Ordmances of God, with the People of God, with Proyer, for, by this meanes there is a great injoyment of God.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> We doe now come to lay downe an Uſe of Comfort and Conſolation to all the People of God; it muſt  needs be a great deale of comfort to the People of God, when the Holy Ghoſt by working an impreſſion in their hearts, it doth carry you on to worke your owne ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the glory of God, what greater comfort can you have? all comfort is wrapt up in the Spirit of God, all are enjoyed by enjoying it, and by enjoying this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: now then there is a teſtimony that you are and of the Children of God, that you have this ſeale up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſoules, you have the Holy Ghoſt to carry you on in the kingdome of grace, and it will lift you up in the kingdome of glory; ſome will ſay, this is a great comfort if that a man leave this evidence, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> did make an impreſsion upon his heart, that he had a Spirit to pray, that he did find an ability to doe ſuch things; for the comfort of this, you ſhall ſee how they were carried on to work things above their power.</p>
            <p>Rom. 8. v. 26, 27. <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit helpeth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſsion for us with groaning which cannot be uttered; but he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the ſpirit, becauſe that he doth make interceſsion for the Saints according to the will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Spirit it doth help you, it doth carry you on to work higher things than your owne ſpirit is able to doe: And I doe make no queſtion but there are ſome here, that when they have come to prayer, their hearts have been cold, and before that they have gone away, their hearts had been warmed with the Spirit of <hi>God.</hi> I would not have you be miſtaken, for there hath been ſome men that have preſumed to ſay, that they had the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115948:8"/>
               <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> when they have no ſuch matter; therefore I will lay downe ſome few ſignes or tokens that you may be certified whether you have the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> or no.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt token is, when there it a comfortable knowledge of the Lord, when that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath wrought a comfortable knowledge of <hi>God;</hi> and when that any man can ſay, I know that my Redeemer liveth, and I doe know that <hi>God</hi> is my <hi>God,</hi> and that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath ſet a ſeale upon my heart, and I doe know that I am the Child of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>John 17. v. 16, 14. <hi>And I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, and knoweth him not; but ye know him, becauſe he dwelleth with you, and in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid, Here is cleer demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of thoſe that are ſanctified, &amp; thoſe that are not.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For thoſe that are not ſanctified, they know nothing above nature, they do not know <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be their Chriſt, nor <hi>God</hi> to be their <hi>God;</hi> but when the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> doth work effectually upon them, then they doe know that they are the Children of <hi>God,</hi> and that the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> is ſealed upon them: the world doe not know him, but the People of <hi>God</hi> they know him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When that there is a liberty in the ſpirit, I doe not ſay a liberty to ſin; but when a man can ſerve <hi>God</hi> freely and couragiouſly, where there is a delight to work the worke of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Cor. 3. v. 16, 14. <hi>Nevertheleſſe when it ſhall turne to the Lord, the vaile ſhall be taken away; Now the Lord is that Spirit, where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty.</hi>

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:115948:9"/>
A wicked man there is, the vaile of ſinne that doth lie upon his heart, that doth keep him downe, it makes him go unwillingly to the Church, that when he doth go to performe any duty, he muſt be forced to it: but for the Child of God that doth goe willingly to Prayer, and to the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third mark is, when the Holy Gh: hath wrought a ſimilitude of himſelf upon the heart of a Man; that is the third point as a Seale, we doe know that the ſeale hath made an impreſſion upon the wax when that we doe take it off there is the ſame marke in the wax as is in the ſeale: ſo the Holy Ghoſt we may know that the Holy Ghoſt hath ſet this ſeale upon you when that there is the ſame forme and image in the ſpirit of the man as is in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>2 Cor. 3. v. 18. <hi>But we all with open face beholding as in a glaſſe the glory of God, are changed into the ſame I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, from glory to glory, even as the Spirit of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where the Holy Ghoſt doth make a powerfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, there is a growth of grace, from one decree of grace to another, till he be made a perfect Saint.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth marke is, when there is a cheerfull ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho anſwering, in the Holy Ghoſt, and without which there is many a poore ſoule doth drop into Hell; then when a poore ſoule will take and miſconſtrue a piece of Scripture to colour his ſinne, that is a very ſad thing; for, now it is a hard matter when a man ſhall argue with the Devill and his owne ſoule, it is like to have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If that he ſhould have ſtood arguing and ſaying, I was a Perſecutor of the Church of God before, and they will never believe me, they may apprehend, and ſtone me, I who before would apprehend Preachers, now am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one my ſelfe: but he did not conferre with fleſh and blood, but went immediately and did as the Lord bid him.</p>

            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> had told them of many ſins, he bid them not grieve the Holy Ghoſt: there is ſuch a tenderneſſe in the ſpirit of a Child of God, that he is mighty care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that he may not diſpleaſe the Spirit of God, nor grieve it, for feare their ſeal and evidence ſhould be loſt.</p>
