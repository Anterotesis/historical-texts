            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>HOW various are the Humours of this Age!</l>
               <l>Sermons at first were follow'd, then the Stage;</l>
               <l>But that they neither are frequented now,</l>
               <l>Is a variety we owe to you:</l>
               <l>One would have thought Extreams which were so vast,</l>
               <l>As pleas'd the Soul and Sense, might longer last.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Your Fathers other methods did pursue,</l>
               <l>Yet some Fops swear they were as wise as you:</l>
               <l>They left not Stage nor Pulpit in the lurch;</l>
               <l>Week-Days they went to Plays, Sundays to Church:</l>
               <l>And judged the Muses gratious did appear,</l>
               <l>Presenting them one new Play every Year.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But without daily new ones you are cloy'd,</l>
               <l>And slight Plays seem as Mistresses enjoy'd.</l>
               <l>For we must sayâ€”we'll give the Devil his due,</l>
               <l>In Wit, as Love, you daily gape for new.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Rare Scenes like Opera's, nay She-Actors too,</l>
               <l>Though they less often Act with us, than you;</l>
               <l>Wherebyâ€”will none here blush when it is said,</l>
               <l>Some with great Bellies Virgin's parts have plaid?</l>
               <l>Yet a good Play once acted, you're so nice,</l>
               <l>You'll go to Church as soon as see it twice.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>s'Death, Gentlemen, this usage we'll not bear,</l>
               <l>You are not better than your Fathers were;</l>
               <l>And if we are not as well us'd by you,</l>
               <l>We'll shut up House, nay worse, our Women too.</l>
               <l>Then with Street Cruzors you must have to do,</l>
               <l>'Mongst which, you'll sometimes board a Fireship too.</l>
               <l>When thus in your Chief Pleasures you are crost,</l>
               <l>You'll value us, like Health, most when 'tis lost.</l>

                     <l>Few Women are by reason lost or got:</l>

                     <l>I try'd a different way to reach my end.</l>
                     <l>Yet <hi>Abner,</hi> I must say, to be possest</l>
                     <l>As much of hers as she is of my Breast;</l>
                     <l>And to enjoy that Monarchy alone,</l>
                     <l>I would despise the Universal Throne.</l>

                     <l>And beg'd me I would make you her Excuse,</l>

               <l>OUR Poet wishes, as I heard him say,</l>
               <l>That all your Criticks would condemn his Play;</l>
               <l>Since if for him that kindness you will do,</l>
               <l>He'll leave off Writing, and turn Critick too:</l>
               <l>He'll find it then a thing of more delight,</l>
               <l>To damn a hundred Plays, than one to write.</l>
               <l>Into your mode he'll quickly too have got,</l>
               <l>Of finding fault where there is cause or not;</l>
               <l>Nay be more pleas'd at all your Plays to hiss,</l>
               <l>Than but to Night to have your Claps at this.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He knows, as well as you, 'tis easier far,</l>
               <l>To be the Iudge than Pris'ner at the Bar.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He's yet good-natur'd, for he ne'er was known</l>
               <l>To hiss at Plays, though worse than are his own:</l>
               <l>Troth, urge him not, for sweetest Wines, you know,</l>
               <l>Ill us'd, to sharpest Vinegar will grow:</l>
               <l>And there's no Tyrant's Rage so fiercely burns,</l>
               <l>As a hiss'd Poet's, when he Critick turns.</l>
               <l>Then to this Play let your Applause be shown,</l>
               <l>If not for Iustice sake, yet for your own.</l>
