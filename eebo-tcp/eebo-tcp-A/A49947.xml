            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To let the World too know that You do not think it beneath You to be officiously Good, even from extremest Heights to discern the lowest Creatures, and give them all the Noblest Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence You can, You brought Her Royal Highness just at the exigent Time, whose single Presence, on the Poet's Day, is a Subsistence for him all the Year after. Ah, <hi>Madam,</hi> if all the short-liv'd Happiness that miserable Poets can enjoy consit in Commendation only; nay, if the most part are content with Pop'lar Breath, and even for that are thankful: How shall I express my self to Your Grace, who by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Goodness, and innate Sweetness, meerly for the sake of doing well, have thus rais'd me above my self. To have Your Grace's Favour is, in a word, to have the Applause of the whole Court, who are its Noblest Ornament, magnificent and eternal Praise. Something there is in Your Mien so much above that we vulgarly call Charming, that to me it seems Adorable, and Your Presence almost Divine, whose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dazling and Majestick Form is a proper Mansion for the most elevated Soul: And let me tell the World, nay, sighing speak it to a Barbarous

Age (I cannot help calling it so, when I think of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Greece)</hi> Your extraordinary Love for Heroick Poetry is not the least Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to shew the Greatness of Your Mind, and fulness of Perfection. To hear You speak with that infinite Sweetness and Chearfulness of Spirit that is natural to Your Grace, is methinks to hear our Tutelar Angels: 'Tis to bemoan the present malicious Times, and remember the Golden Age: But to behold you too, is to make Prophets quite forget their Heaven, and bind the Poets with eternal Rapture.

               <hi>Ziphares</hi> and <hi>Semandra</hi> were first Your Grace's Favourites; and though I ought not, <hi>Madam,</hi> to praise Your Wit by your Judgment of my Painting, yet I must say, Such Characters every Dauber cannot draw. It has been often observed against me, That I abound in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govern'd Fancy; but I hope the World will pardon the Sallies of Youth: Age, Despondence, and Dulness come too fast of themselves. I discommend no Man for keeping the beaten Road; but I am sure the Noble Hunters that follow the Game, must leap Hedges and Ditches sometimes, and run at all, or never come in to the fall of the Quarry. My comfort is, I cannot be so ridiculous a Creature to any Man as I am to my self: for, who should know the House so well as the good Man at home? who, when his Neighbours come to see him, still sets the best Rooms to view; and, if he be not a wilful Ass, keeps the Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish and Lumber in some dark Hole, where no body comes but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to mortifie at melancholy, Hours. But how then, <hi>Madam,</hi> in this unsuitable condition, how shall I answer the infinite Honours and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations Your Grace has laid upon me? Your Grace, who is the most beautiful Idea of Love and Glory; who, to that Divine Composition, have the noblest and best-natur'd Wit in the World. All I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>Madam,</hi> and be able to perform, is, That your Grace shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see a Play of mine that shall give offence to Modesty and Vertue; and what I humbly offer to the World, shall be of use at least, and I hope deserve imitation; which is, or ought to be, I am sure, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of all <hi>Tragedies</hi> and <hi>Comedies</hi> both Ancient and Modern. I should presume to promise my self too some Success in things of this nature, if.

            <head>Epilogue.</head>
            <l>THrice happy they that never writ before;</l>
            <l>How pleas'd and bold they quit the safer shore:</l>
            <l>Like some new Captain of the City Bands,</l>
            <l>That with big looks in <hi>Finsbury</hi> Commands,</l>
            <l>Swell'd, with huge Ale he cries, beat, beat a Drum,</l>
            <l>Pox o' the <hi>French-</hi>King, uds bud let him come:</l>
            <l>Give me ten thousand Redcoats, and alloo,</l>
            <l>We'll firk his <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>qui</hi> and his <hi>Conde</hi> too.</l>
            <l>Thus the young Scriblers, Mankinds sense disdain;</l>
            <l>For ignorance is sure to make 'em vain,</l>
            <l>But far from Vanity, or dang'rous pride;</l>
            <l>Our cautious Poet courts you to his side:</l>
            <l>For why should you be scorn'd, to whom are due,</l>
            <l>All the good days that ever Authors knew.</l>
            <l>If ever gay 'tis you that make 'em fine;</l>
            <l>The Pit and Boxes make the Poet dine,</l>
            <l>And he scarce drinks but of the Criticks Wine.</l>
            <l>Old Writers should not for vain glory strive</l>
            <l>But like old Mistresses think how to thrive,</l>
            <l>Be fond of ev'ry thing their Keepers say,</l>
            <l>At least till they can live without a Play.</l>
            <l>Like one that knows the Trade, and has been bit;</l>
            <l>She doats and fawns upon her wealthy Cit;</l>
            <l>And swears she loves him meerly for his Wit.</l>
            <l>Another more untaught than a <hi>Walloon,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Antick and ugly, like an old Baboon;</l>
            <l>She swears is an accomplisht <hi>Beau-garson,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Turns with all winds, and sails with all desires;</l>
            <l>All hearts in City, Town, and Court, she sires,</l>
            <l>Young callow Lords, lean Knights, and driv'ling Squires.</l>
            <l>She in resistless flattery finds her ends,</l>
            <l>Gives thanks for Fools, and makes ye all her Friends,</l>
            <l>So should wise Poets sooth an awkard Age,</l>
            <l>For they are Prostitutes upon the Stage:</l>
            <l>To stand on points were foolish and ill-bred,</l>
            <l>As for a Lady to be nice in Bed:</l>
            <l>Your wills alone must their performance measure,</l>
            <l>And you may turn 'em ev'ry way for pleasure.</l>
