            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>VIENNA,</hi> hitherto look'd upon to be the Bulwark of <hi>Germany,</hi> and conſequently of all Chriſtendom, and for many years the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Emperor, is ſeated upon the Right-hand-ſhoar of the great River <hi>Danow,</hi> where the River <hi>Vien,</hi> from whence the City takes its Name, empties its ſelf into the larger Stream, twenty ſix <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Miles from <hi>Lintz,</hi> and ten from <hi>Polon.</hi> It was firſt encompaſled with a Wall in the Year 1200. at a vaſt expence, though the Money was eaſily come by; for <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, King of <hi>England,</hi> being taken by Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> in his Return from the Holy Land, he would not ſet the King at liberty till he had paid the Ranſom then demanded, which the Duke preſently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Fortification of his Capital Seat.</p>
            <p>It was made an Imperial City by the Emperor <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> the Second; ſince which time, as it has received many Additions of Beauty and Strength from its friends, ſo has it felt the Fury of many a potent Enemy.</p>
            <p>Among the reſt, it was a great Eye-Sore to <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, who deſired in his Prayers that he might only live to perform three things, <hi>viz.</hi> to repair the vaſt <hi>Aquaeduct</hi> in <hi>Conſtantinosle,</hi> that conveighs the Water for above 20 Miles into the City; to repair the two Bridges in both Bays of the Sea; and to be Maſter of <hi>Vienna.</hi> To which purpoſe, in the Year 1529. he ſate down before it with an Army of 300000 Men: But not withſtanding the haughty <hi>Mahumetan</hi> did all that Art or Induſtry could do, notwithſtanding that he ſtorm'd it no leſs than twenty times, yet it was ſo well defended by the Prince Palatine <hi>Philip,</hi> that the murmuring Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant was forc'd to raiſe his Siege, after three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days continual Battery, and make a haſty Retreat; never looking behind him till he got under the Walls of <hi>Buda.</hi> Yet Story affirms that the City was neither then ſo well fortified, nor the Garriſon ſo numerous; which gave us a rational ground to hope that the <hi>Turk</hi> may have as little reaſon to boaſt of his gains in this his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Enterprize, as he had then. <hi>Solyman</hi> way call'd in by the Waywod of <hi>Tranſylvania, John</hi> of <hi>Zapolia.</hi> Nor did the preſent Great Turk want an Invitation in the ſame manner, as appears by the Confeſſion of Count <hi>Serini;</hi> who having trayterouſly revolted from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and joyned with a Body of 8000 <hi>Tartars,</hi> was ſet upon by General <hi>Dunwald,</hi> in the Woods not far from <hi>Vienna,</hi> defeated, and himſelf taken Priſoner: which ſucceſsful beginning, as it was not a little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> and hundreds of poor Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives there by deliver'd from unſpeakable Diſtreſs, ſo it made the Diſcovery of <hi>Serini</hi>'s forementioned Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as being the Perſon that had perſwaded the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> to undertake the Siege, upon aſſurance that the Place was unprovided. Whether He, or <hi>Teckly,</hi> or both were the Authors of it it ſeems the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> ſoon accepted the kind invitation; and ſo about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>July</hi> paſs'd his numerous Army athis ſide the <hi>Raab;</hi> which the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> obſerving, ſent Count <hi>Starenberg</hi> and General <hi>Captiers</hi> to Command in chief in the City, together with a Body of 10000 Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce the Garriſon, which conſiſted before of the ſame Number, and ſo poſted himſelf near the Bridge of Boats over the <hi>Danow,</hi> while <hi>Teckley</hi> lay encamped at <hi>Tyrnaw,</hi> upon the River <hi>Wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon the 18th. of <hi>July,</hi> the Emperor receiv'd Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that his Imperial Seat was ſurrounded by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> had taken up his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Palace of the Empreſs Dowager, call'd <hi>La Favorita,</hi> Mark'd <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>In three days time the <hi>Turks</hi> had ſo cloſely begirt the Town, that it was impoſſible to paſs in or out; which done, they made their three firſt Attacks upon the Iſland of <hi>Tabor,</hi> and the Suburbs call'd <hi>Leopoldſtadt,</hi> and that ſo vigorouſly, that they became Maſters of them for a time; but at length were forc'd to quit thoſe Poſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, not without great ſlaughter; inſomuch that as it is ſaid, in one Sally of the Garriſon, they loſt no leſs than 8000 Men, and ſome of principal Quality among them.</p>
            <p>This occaſion'd the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> to ſend to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor for a Truce for ſome hours, that he might have time to bury his dead Souldiers, and withal, to let the Governor underſtand, That if he did not ſurrender in time, but ſtaid till the Town were taken by Storm, he would put Man, Woman and Child to the Sword. To which the Governor return'd a ſutable Anſwer; That he needed no Truce, his Garriſon being well; that the <hi>Vizier</hi> might well have ſpar'd his Menaces; and that for his part, he knew better how to defend his Charge, than to think of ever ſurrendring it: of the truth of which, he would ſoon convince him by his Actions; of which he might well be the more confident, in regard the Burgers and Students had given him their Oaths to defend the place to the laſt, and never to hearken to any Propoſitions from the Enemy, though never ſo advantageous. Nevertheleſs the Governour thought it but very neceſſary to take ſeveral ſums of Money out of the Religious Houſes for the better payment and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the Souldiers.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> receiving In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that Count <hi>Teckely,</hi> being joyn'd with a great Body of <hi>Turks,</hi> was March'd toward <hi>Presburgh,</hi> advanc'd toward them; but the Enemy, upon News of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, thought it convenient to retire. Whereupon the Duke ſent 6000 <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe under the Command of the Chevalier <hi>Lubomirski,</hi> to fall upon the Enemies Rear, while he followed after with his whole Army; which was by <hi>Lubomirski</hi> done with that Valour and Succeſs, that the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Hungarian</hi> Rebels were forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire with great loſs of Men, all their Baggage, and a thouſand Waggons laden with Ammunition and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>The Beſiegers all this while playd upon the Town inceſſantly from ſeven Batteries, and ſprung two Mines; by the firſt of which, they loſt many Men, as being counter-min'd; by the latter they had better Succeſs; for by the help of it, they lodg'd themſelves in the Ditch, but were beaten out again with great loſs. All this was ſignify'd by Letters of the 14th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> from <hi>Paſſaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Letters of the 27th. of <hi>Aug,</hi> came other Intelligence, that the <hi>Turks</hi> had made a moſt fierce Aſſault upon the 16th inſtant, and had ſprung ſeveral Mines, by means whereof they had blown up part of a Ravelin between the <hi>Scotch</hi> Gate, Mark'd <hi>C.</hi> and the Palace-Gate, Mark'd and lodg'd themſelves upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp, but the Beſieged would not ſuffer them to continue long there; for they preſently ſally'd out 4000 ſtrong, and with great ſlaughter of Men beat them from the poſts they had taken; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the <hi>Turks</hi> were reſolved not to part ſo; for being re-inforc'd with a freſh Body of Men, they endeavour'd to recover their loſſes, which occaſion'd a very fierce Diſpute, that laſted for five or ſix hours; the Victory enclining ſometimes to the one, ſometimes to the other ſide; but in concluſion the <hi>Turks</hi> were forc'd to retire, with the loſs of near 3000 Men. In this Diſpute the Beſieged loſt 500 Men, and ſeveral Officers; amongſt the reſt, Count <hi>Leſly,</hi> with the Barons <hi>Rottolinski,</hi> and <hi>Walter,</hi> Lieutenant Colonels, with ſeveral inſeriour Officers. The Governour alſo himſelf was ſlightly hurt in the Shoulder; but Count <hi>Zouches</hi> deſperate'y wounded in the Head; of which he afterwards died.</p>
            <p>Of this Action the Governour fail'd not to give Advice by the help of two men, whom he got to ſwim the River, to the D. of <hi>Lorain,</hi> to the end he might the better underſtand the condition of the Place</p>
            <p>In all theſe Attacks, as a Janizary, being taken Pris'ner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to the Governor, the Enemy loſt 11000 Men, with the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha's of <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> and <hi>Albania.</hi> Soon after this the <hi>Turks</hi> ſprang a Mine under the other part of the ſame Ravelin, made an Attack no leſs than 11000 ſtrong, and with that force an inconſiderable Lodgment, with the loſs of 300 Men; but the next Morning the Governour ſprang another Mine, which not only diſlodg'd, but buried a great number of the Enemy among the Ruines.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, by Letters from <hi>Lints,</hi> comes Intelligence of more Field-Action, how that upon the March of 15000 <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> toward the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army, to attack them before their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Troops of the Empire; the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> Order'd the Chevalier <hi>Lubomirski</hi> with the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Horſe to advance toward the Enemy; and in caſe he found them too ſtrong for him, to retire, and draw the Enemy after him. Which Orders he accordingly executed with good Succeſs; for the Enemy believing the <hi>Poles</hi> had fled, follow'd them with great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and eagerneſs ſo far, till the D. of <hi>Lorain,</hi> who was prepar'd to receive them, eaſily ſurrounded them, and cut the greateſt part of them in pieces: The reſt fled in ſo great confuſion, that they who eſcap'd the Sword, were drown'd in the River <hi>Mark.</hi> The Baſha's of <hi>Caniſia</hi> and <hi>Erla</hi> commanded theſe Forces; of whom the one was drown'd in ſwimming the River, the other was kill'd.</p>
            <p>In the heat of theſe Field-Tranſactions, the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> was not idle; but fuming to be repuls'd ſo vigorouſly, and that his Mines took no better effect, he reſolv'd upon an Enterprize that might have prov'd fatal to the City, had not Providence prevented it: To which purpoſe he ſet his Miners at work a ſecond time, to dig once more under the Court-Baſtion, who went ſo low, that they tapp'd under a water that ran beneath the Foundation of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>The Beſieged heard them at it, and briskly countermin'd them, but when they had broke into the Mine, and ſaw the fatal Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the <hi>Turk,</hi> there was not one that would adventure to ſtep into the Mine to prevent the diſmal Blow, till Count <hi>Staren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> put himſelf at the Head of his daſtardly Miners, and undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly led them into the Train. Then Shame and a brave Example inſpir'd with re-inforcements of new Courage, that having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Governour to retire, they entred the Enemies Mine, waſh'd and ſwept away the Train, and brought out of the Mine fifty Quintals of Gunpowder, every Quintal containing a hundred weight.</p>
