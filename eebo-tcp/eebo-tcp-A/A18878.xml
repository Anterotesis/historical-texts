            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue many tymes notedde and marked / my famylyare Brutus, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Cato, thy vncle / whan he shewed his mynde in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate / entrate of matters of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite taken out of phylosophy / far distant fro this exercise of oratory in the iudiciall place &amp; touchyng the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welthe. But not with standynge he dyd optayne by his perswadyng / that his wordes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the people to be allowed / 
<pb facs="tcp:11594:4"/>
whiche in hym is greatlyer to be extemed / than in the or in me. For we vse more that ꝑte of phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phye / that bryngeth copy of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence / wherin the thynges be sayde that be not far different fro the opinion of people. Cato in myn opinion is a ꝑfyte Stoike / and holdeth the opinions / which be not allowed amonge the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men people. He is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> secte whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che followeth no florysshynge of speche / nor dylateth his matter. But he brought to passe by breue and lytle questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (and as a man wolde say) by sharpe poyntes the thing that he purposed. But ther is nothynge so incredible / but by persuadyng / it may be made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable &amp; to be allowed: Nothyng so ragged and so rude / but it may be made clene and ornate. which
<pb facs="tcp:11594:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered to be so / I more boldely wente to worke / than he of whom I speake. For Cato is wonte to speke after the schole of Zeno / onely of magnanimite / of continence / of dethe / of all maner laude of <abbr>vtue</abbr> / of goddes immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall / of the loue that men shulde haue to theyr natyue countreye / vsynge no colours or orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of an orator. But I in sport haue cast in to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune places / tho thynges / whiche the scholes of Socrates do scantlye allowe in scholes / or in tyme of quietnes. whiche bicause they be maruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous / and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the opinion of all menne / be also called the Paradoxe.

<pb facs="tcp:11594:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they shulde be allowed / or whether ther were one sondre spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che of lerned men and an other vulgare after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people. And therfore I wrote the places more gladly, bicause these that be called my Paradoxe semethe spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates / and very true. Therfore thou shalt receiue this litle worke studied &amp; compyled these nightes nowe beinge shorte: Bycause the other worke of greatter watche &amp; study wente forthe in thy name.
