            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>which are unsignificant as to the Truth, whether speculative or practick; for there can be neither</hi> Faith <hi>nor</hi> Love <hi>in them: yet I have endeavoured to make the Answers to these Questions (though grounded on such unnecessary excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to contain some very necessary and sound Divinity, for which purpose I have put them into large Chapters, and have assigned to each Chapter large Contents, being resolved to answer the</hi> Cause <hi>for the satisfaction of others, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the</hi> Objection, <hi>for the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication ofmy self.

afflictions of the Gospel, according to the Power of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>He that is ashamed of his Religion, is ashamed of the Testimony of the Lord; He that forsakes his Church when she is the Lords</hi> Prisoner, <hi>did hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally follow her when she was the Lords free</hi> Servant; <hi>and refusing to partake in the afflictions of the Gospel, shews he embraced the Gospel according to the</hi> custom <hi>of men, not according to the</hi> Power <hi>of God:</hi> But the Word of God is not bound, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9.) <hi>These Truths which we profess accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods word, will alwaies be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to the worlds end, though with less</hi> visibility, <hi>yet not with less</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy; <hi>and if Protestants shall go from them, Papists shall return to them; For God that can raise</hi> Children out of Stones, <hi>will never be without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness among his own children, and I look upon</hi> all Christians at large <hi>as his children, though only upon</hi> good Christians <hi>as his dutiful children;</hi>

            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <head>The Answer.</head>
               <p>HE that teacheth men to live righteously, teacheth them to pray continually, even to lift up holy hands and holy hearts to him that dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the heavens: But sin must be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ont of the soul, before the soul can truly be poured out in prayer: For in vain is <hi>Holiness</hi> in the <hi>mouth,</hi> whiles <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness</hi> is in the <hi>heart;</hi> in vain are we <hi>Saints</hi> in our expressions, whiles we are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105952:9"/>
                  <hi>Sinners</hi> in our affections and in our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; in vain do we think of multiplying our prayers, whiles we resolve to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our sins; for that is not to ask God forgiveness <hi>of sins past,</hi> but to ask him leave <hi>of future sinning:</hi> So little reason is there for our eyes to be dazled at seeing that Truth, which the born blind man could not but see, <hi>God heareth not sinners,</hi> John 9. 31. For there needs no other light to see the Sun withall, but its <hi>own;</hi> And this being a Proposition so clear as to be known by its own light, may very well stand for its own exposition.</p>
               <p>But concerning Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> gloss, it is thus at large in his own Tract. (for both <hi>Aquinas</hi> whom I alledged, and <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donat</hi> whom you alledge, cite it imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Adhuc inunctus loquitur; nam &amp; Peccatores exaudit Deus; si enim Peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Deus non exaudiret, frustra ille Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus oculos in terram dimittens &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus suum percutiens diceret, Deus propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius esto mihi peccatori. <hi>He is yet blind, whiles he speaketh this; for God doth hear sinners; for if God did not hear sinners, in vain did the Publican fix his eye upon the ground, and strike his hand upon his breast, saying, God he mercifull to me a sinner.</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:105952:9"/>
And surely this is not an <hi>Exposition,</hi> but an <hi>Exception</hi> upon that generall rule gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Text, <hi>God heareth not sinners:</hi> For it is resolved into this sense, God heareth not a sinner as a <hi>sinner,</hi> but only as a <hi>Penitent,</hi> such as was the Publican when God heard him. Which though it be an admirable doctrine, yet is it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered there by Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> as an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception against,</hi> not as an <hi>Exposition upon</hi> the blind mans words, and was clearly so intended by him. For it is certain that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> was of the contrary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, and did believe that <hi>God doth hear sinners,</hi> since himself professeth this belief; <hi>Lib</hi> 1. <hi>Retr. c.</hi> 3. Nec illud mihi placet, quòd quùm dixissem Summa opera danda est optimis moribus, mox addidi, Deus enim noster aliter nos exaudire non poterit, benè autem inventis facillimè ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>audiet; Sic enim dictum est tanquam Deus non exaudiat peccatores, quod qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam dixit in Evangelio, sed ille qui non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum cognoverat Christum. <hi>Nor doth that please me, that when I had said, we must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour above all things to live vertuously, I presently added, for else our God cannot hear us; but he will easily hear us if we live well; For that was so spoken as if God did not hear</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105952:10"/>
                  <hi>sinners, which a certain man said in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, but he which yet knew not Christ.</hi> Now Sir, look upon my words again, and do not think I have mistaken Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> but rather that you have mistaken me, and heaped up a company of hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous quotations against me, as if I had mistaken my self; whereas all my guilt is, that I did not follow Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion, because I took <hi>Peccatores</hi> in a stricter sense then he did; not for those who unwillingly were under the <hi>infection,</hi> but for those who willingly were under the <hi>dominion</hi> of sin. Wherein however I did no more then <hi>Aquinas</hi> had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; for whereas Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> thought it was not a true Proposition, <hi>God heareth not sinners,,</hi> Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> said it was, if the word <hi>Sinners</hi> were taken properly (as it ought in every expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) for so is his ingenuous profession; Quamvis possit verificari si intelligitur de peccatore in quantum est peccator, per quem etiam modum oratio ejus dicitur execrabilis: <hi>Though it may be made true, if we understand it of a sinner as a sinner, for so his prayer is called abominable.</hi> He relates to Prov. 28. 9. <hi>He that turneth away his ear from Hearing the Law, even his</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:105952:10"/>
                  <hi>prayer shall be an abomination;</hi> Oratio ejus erit execrabilis, (saith the Latine;) so that this is a most undoubted Truth, not only made known to us by the light of nature, as I formerly asserted, but also by the light of Grace, and the two convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of that light, the Old and the New Testament, that <hi>God heareth not sinners;</hi> And it is more fully explained in the Old then in the New, (as are generally those Truths which the Law preacheth, whose office it was to terrifie and frighten men into obedience) for it is much more to say, God will <hi>abominate</hi> or <hi>hate</hi> his prayer, then to say, God will not <hi>hear</hi> it. 2. Now, Sir, if this be the generall rule, <hi>God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not sinners, as sinners;</hi> tis clearly an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this rule, to say, He heareth sinners as <hi>Penitents,</hi> since that gloss is not properly an <hi>Exposition,</hi> but an <hi>Exception,</hi> which changeth the originall sense and meaning of the Text, as a sinner into no sinner, that God may hear him: And yet here will be <hi>found,</hi> or must be <hi>made</hi> a greater change of the Text then this, to make your ensuing allegations so many severall <hi>expositions,</hi> and not rather so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny severall <hi>exceptions,</hi> or at least so many severall <hi>descants</hi> or <hi>variations</hi> upon this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105952:11"/>
Rule; For then we must put <hi>audit</hi> for <hi>non audit,</hi> and say, <hi>not hearing</hi> doth signifie <hi>hearing,</hi> and so turn a negative propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into an affirmative, that we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it. Truly Sir, in my poor judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is safer and better to say, God heareth the <hi>Sin,</hi> not the <hi>Prayer,</hi> when he heareth the sinner only in Anger: That this is rather Gods not hearing, then his hearing, whiles he continues in his anger; and mans not praying, then his praying, whiles he continues in his sin: For I fear if I say otherwise, I shall be forced to grant, That God did once hear the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils prayers, since I find <hi>they besought him that He would not send them away out of the Countrey.</hi> There's such a kind of <hi>sinners praying,</hi> and <hi>he suffered them to enter into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rd of swine.</hi> There's such a kind of <hi>Gods hearing;</hi> (Mark 5. 10.) They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought our blessed Saviour for a liberty to do mischief; will you call that praying? Then say, Prayer may be <hi>without,</hi> nay <hi>against Religion;</hi> for how full may facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mens mouthes be of such prayers, whiles their hearts are empty of faith, and of the fear of God? And he gave them that liberty; will you call that a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Prayer? Then say, That hearing of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105952:11"/>
Prayer is not an Act of Grace, but of Vengeance; for a liberty of doing mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, doth of it self tend to nothing but to the increase of damnation: He that seriously considers Prayer to be an elevation of the soul to God, will not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily allow it to be an engagement of the soul to the Devil. 3. As for Gods hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good desires of naturall men, that is also in my weak apprehension, another <hi>exception</hi> against this generall Rule, <hi>God heareth not sinners;</hi> rather then an <hi>exposition</hi> of it: So far am I from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Aquinas</hi> intended to expound this rule, by turning it into a question; and much further was I from saying, That he made a sufficient exposition of it: For I must look upon all naturall men, as God looks upon them, that is as <hi>sinners;</hi> so saith the Text most expresly, <hi>God look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that did seek God: Every one of them is gone back, they are altogether become filthy, there is none that doth good, no not one,</hi> Psalm 53. 2, 3. which is alledged by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> as a proof that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 9, 10, 11, 12. That is, They are all under sin as they are

               <p>POpe <hi>Siricius</hi> his doctrine concerning marriage is plain enough in his Epistle <hi>ad Himarium Tarrac</hi> recorded by <hi>Binius Tom.</hi> 1 <hi>concil.</hi> and cited by me as his first degmaticall Epistle, because so I find it the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> words, <hi>They that are in the flesh cannot please God:</hi> which being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to them in regard of their <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> and not of their <hi>Priesthood,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them as <hi>married men,</hi> and not as <hi>married Priests;</hi> even as he that saith, A blaspheming Priest ought to be disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, sheweth that disdain belongeth to the <hi>man,</hi> not to the <hi>Priest:</hi> For in a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Priest, it is the man, not the Priest, is the blasphemer, though as a Priest he is the greater sinner by blaspheming: So in a married Priest, it is the <hi>man,</hi> not the <hi>Priest</hi> who is married; and therefore if a married Priest be said to be in the flesh, his being in the flesh must be ascribed to him from his <hi>marriage,</hi> not from his <hi>Priesthood;</hi> for it may be ascribed to all other married men as well as to him: This
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105952:16"/>
is the doctrine concerning marriage, which I blamed in <hi>Siricius,</hi> as I found it had flowed from his own pen; And it is to small purpose (it seems) that <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> hath endeavoured so long after, to furnish him with a little better Ink; For even from his new proposition which he puts upon <hi>Siricius, [That Priests may not have commerce with their wives]</hi> you infer this conclusion,</p>
               <p>That <hi>for Priests to marry is to be in the flesh;</hi> only you annex some new proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to make your conclusion <hi>sound</hi> the <hi>better,</hi> though it is impossible to <hi>make</hi> it <hi>good;</hi> and they are these, That <hi>for Priests to marry, is contrary to the Churches order, and to the doctrine and decree of the Apostles, and to be in a continuall state of sin and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I am very sorry that your zeal to excuse <hi>Siricius,</hi> hath in effect made you accuse both the Church and the Apostles of Christ; For it is an high accusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst both, to say that they have forbid Priests to marry, since Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckons this among the <hi>doctrines of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, Forbidding to marry,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in generall of the <hi>prohibition,</hi> in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it forbid marriage, whether in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105952:16"/>
                  <hi>Priests</hi> or in any other <hi>men;</hi> And now by the help of this Text, I have found out a fit subject for your abominable praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, <hi>[To be in a continuall state of sin and damnation]</hi> For none is truly <hi>in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall state of damnation,</hi> but only the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> or they that are led captive by him at his will, which cannot <hi>justly,</hi> much less <hi>charitably,</hi> be said of any sort of men meerly for using that liberty which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ nor his Church hath denyed them, especially if they use it, (as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they should, and I hope they do) <hi>not for an occasion to the flesh, but as the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God,</hi> that they may with the <hi>lesser distraction,</hi> if not with the <hi>greater devotion,</hi> attend his service.</p>
               <p>Wherefore though this doctrine of forbidding Priests marriage, may not be disliked by you as you are a <hi>Papist,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it came from a <hi>Pope;</hi> yet pray let it not be approved by you as you are a <hi>Christian,</hi> because it first came from the <hi>Devil;</hi> And it were to be wished that those of your party who desire to be thought of a purer mould then all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind besides, would so labour from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth to make us poor sinners <hi>more then Angels,</hi> (for it is more to put off, then
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105952:17"/>
not to put on the flesh) as not to make themselves little <hi>less then Devils,</hi> by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating Gods own holy institution, and shooting such thunderbolts as may well be thought to come from the Prince of the air, but sure cannot come from the God of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For he hath spoken in a still small voice, <hi>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it,</hi> Mat. 19. 12. And again by his Apostle, <hi>Nevertheless to avoid fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let every man have his own wife,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 2. If God say <hi>every man,</hi> for you to say, the Church hath said <hi>not a Clergy-man,</hi> is to accufe the Church of that which she hath taught you daily to pray against, even of the <hi>contempt of Gods Word and Commandement;</hi> For Christ who spake the one <hi>by himself,</hi> the other <hi>by his Spirit,</hi> is Head of the Church, and therefore it is monstrous and prodigious to affirm, that the Church, which is his body, hath spoken otherwise; For sure the <hi>body</hi> cannot have a <hi>voice</hi> without the <hi>Head;</hi> and Christs Church is such a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as will not have a voice <hi>without,</hi> and much less <hi>against</hi> her <hi>Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore you should not have said <hi>The Churches precept,</hi> but <hi>your</hi>

                  <hi>Churches,</hi> or rather your Popes precept, when you spake of forbidding Priests to marry; for your own Canonist calls the statute which inhibits Priests marriage, Statutum Ecclesiae non ita generale, <hi>Glos. in Decr. par.</hi> 2. <hi>Causa</hi> 25. <hi>c.</hi> 3.

Dist. 84. cap. 3. descanting upon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Canon of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which you have urged; for there saith the Gloss, Dicunt quod olim sacerdotes potera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t contrahere ante Siricium; <hi>They say that Priests might lawfully marry before</hi> Siricius <hi>his daies.</hi> And again, A tempore <hi>Siricii</hi> vocat Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitatem,

                  <hi>The Canon calleth that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which was from the time of</hi> Siricius: 5. And whereas the Canon (as it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him) affirmeth that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles taught this doctrine, the same Gloss brings fresh fasting spittle to allay this quick-silver, and the allay is good enough for the metall, saying, Apostoli docuerunt exemplo &amp; opere, &amp; admonitione, non institutione vel constitutione, <hi>The Apostles taught it by their example, deed, or admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not by their doctrine, or any consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;</hi> So far is it from truth, (in the judgement of your own Canonists) which you averr so confidently, <hi>That the Apostles themselves were the first that taught and decreed that Priests ought to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from wives.</hi> And besides it is clear from the Apostles own writings, that they neither taught it nor decreed it: Else why did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> say to <hi>Timothy,</hi> (1 Tim. 3.) <hi>A Bishop must be blameless, the husband of one wife,</hi> if he were indeed to be blamed for having <hi>one?</hi> And that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con, I speak this by permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and not of commandment,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 6. if the Apostles had given any command concerning it? And <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>I would that all men were even as I my self, but every man hath his proper gift of God;</hi> if there had been any Apostolicall decree to force those who succeeded him in his <hi>calling,</hi> to succeed him also in his <hi>continency;</hi> for then sure he would not have <hi>wished,</hi> but have <hi>commanded</hi> them to be as himself, whereas on the contrary he only <hi>wisheth</hi> them to be as himself, who have the <hi>Gift</hi> enabling them so to be; <hi>therefore the Apostles decreed it not:</hi> And the truth of both these was antiently attested by your own <hi>Gratians</hi> ordinary copies of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Canon; for so saith your new Glossator upon those words, [Apostoli docuerunt] In vulgatis codicibus sequebatur <hi>Exempla,</hi> quod est sublatum, <hi>In the ordinary copies it was written, The Apostles taught it by their Example, but I have taken that away.</hi> The addition of which word <hi>Example,</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Gratian</hi> himself or by any other) being commonly received, is a sufficient evidence that even the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in those daies did not think that the Apostles had forbid Priests to marry,

From the Apostles, let us pass to the Church, for you say, <hi>for Priests to marry is contrary to the Churches precept:</hi> But you do only say it, and will never be able to prove it: For the Greek Church in its most pure and flourshing age, had a <hi>married Clergy,</hi> insomuch that <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> was born after his Father had officiated at the holy Altar; let his own mouth witness it, who brings in his Father thus speaking unto him,</p>

               <p>Again, How came the first Council of <hi>Nice</hi> to be kept from determining for the forced continency of Priests by one single <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> if so be the Apostles had so determined before, or the Church had

Nay it is evident, The Catholick Church determined there should be no such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, as appears from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited consent of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers to <hi>Paphnutius</hi> his advice, which is generally attested and approved by the Authors both of the Greek and Latine Church; As by <hi>Socrates,</hi> lib. 1. c. 11.

                  <hi>Christ:</hi> For so far doth your own <hi>Gratian</hi> justifie this Truth, as to assure us That the marriage of Priests was lawful at that time in every Countrey over all the Christian world: <hi>Dist.</hi> 56. <hi>c.</hi> 13.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105952:23"/>
saith that <hi>Gratian</hi> was mistaken as to the Latine Church, sheweth little reason for his own confidence, because no pretence or proof for the others mistake, till this Decree of <hi>Siricius,</hi> which was not made till almost 400. and not generally ratified or received in his own Diocess, till above a 1000. years after Christ: For so <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> himself hath recorded, that in the year 1074. this Decree of prohibiting Priests marriage was forced upon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Italy, Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh, after they had unanimously gainsayed, and most earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprecated and opposed it, <hi>(v. Bar. An.</hi> 1074. <hi>nu.</hi> 37, 38, 39.) Now if this Decree were not generally received in the Latine Church till then, though it were <hi>made</hi> before, yet was it not <hi>ratified</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> till then; for that is an undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rule of her own Canonist, Leges instituuntur quùm promulgantur, firman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quùm moribus utentium approban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>(Grat.</hi> Par. 1.

Whence it follows, That neither this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Siricius,</hi> nor any other of the like nature, could properly be called a Prohibition, till that time when it was first generally received imto Practice, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105952:23"/>
that was not til the year 1074. a longtime sure after the Apostles: And this same Truth is attested by <hi>Gratian</hi> in the first words of his 31. distinction, <hi>Tempus quoque, Quia nondum erat institutum ut sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotes continentiam servarent;</hi> where your new Glossator is very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to prove that <hi>Sacerdot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

2. That second Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> scarce deserves to have the <hi>credit,</hi> and cannot have the <hi>authority</hi> of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Africane Church: First because for ought that can be collected out of the acts thereof, there were not above seven Bishops present at it, (no more then were at a Collation with the Donatists) <hi>v. Bin. Conc. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Col. p.</hi> 624. whereas <hi>Africa</hi> afforded above two hundred Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and they were all by their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons strictly bound to be present at Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Synods.</p>
               <p>Secondly because there is a plain and a gross untruth set down in the first words of that Council, as it is in the Latine Copy, (which only befriends your asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) for there it is said, [Gloriosissimo Imperatore Valentiniano Augusto 4. &amp; Theodosio viris clarissimis consulibus. i. <hi>Whiles</hi> Valentinian <hi>the Emperour was Consul the fourth time, and</hi> Theodosius <hi>with him, these Bishops met at</hi> Carthage] whereas it is evident by the Archives of Chronologie, That <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our never at all was Consul with <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius;</hi> and it is as clear by the same Archives that when <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour was Consul the fourth time, <hi>Neotorius</hi> (not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105952:25"/>
                  <hi>Theodosius)</hi> was his partner; (See <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicus</hi> An. Christ. vul. 390.) So I shew you plainly we have a <hi>false Consul put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Council;</hi> and I have some reason to suspect we have also a <hi>false Council put upon the Church:</hi> For it is clear that this Council was not held in the year 390. when <hi>Valentinian</hi> was Consul the fourth time, because <hi>Genedius,</hi> (who speaks first in it, and was President of it) was not taken by <hi>Aurelius</hi> to be his Coadjutor at <hi>Carthage,</hi> till after Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> had been taken by <hi>Valerius</hi> to be his Coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor at <hi>Hippo,</hi> (as saith <hi>Binius,</hi> Aurelius factum Valerii Hipponensis imitatus, onus Episcopale in Genedium stranstulit) And it is asserted by <hi>Helvicus,</hi> That Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> was made Priest of the Church of <hi>Hippo</hi> but in the year 391. that is, the year after this Consulage: And sure he lived some years a Priest of that Church, before he was made Bishop thereof, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance so many as to satisfie the custom of the Church; but sure so many as to write full thirteen Books (as appears by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractations, lib. 1. cap. 14.) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his continual Preaching all that time: For he was required and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by his Bishop to be a Preacher
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105952:26"/>
whiles he was yet a Priest, which till his daies had not been known in the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane Church; and he preached both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately and publickly against the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, Manichaeans and Pelagians, saith <hi>Possidius;</hi> and sure the more time he spent in <hi>Preaching,</hi> the less time he had for <hi>writing;</hi> But to let pass collections and conjectures, we see <hi>Genedius</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of this Council, was not a Bishop till after Saint <hi>Augustine;</hi> And Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> was not so much as a Priest till one year after the date of this Council; so it is certain the <hi>Council</hi> hath a <hi>false date,</hi> and it is possible we may have a <hi>false Council;</hi> Accordingly <hi>Binius</hi> is forced to confess, That the second Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> though it was so in <hi>Title,</hi> yet was not so in <hi>Truth;</hi> but was such a <hi>second</hi> as had at least <hi>five</hi> before <hi>it;</hi> Post quinque saltem ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riora, hoc quod secundum appellatur, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum fuisse oportet: Which he proves, first from the Bishops names recited in the Acts of this Council, <hi>Genedius, Alypius, Faustinus,</hi> who were not Bishops till long after the year that <hi>Valentinian</hi> was the fourth time Consul. Secondly from the very words of this very second Canon which you have alledged: For that begins
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105952:26"/>
thus, Quùm in praeterito consilio de continentiae &amp; castitatis moderamine tractaretur; relating to a fore-past Council, which fore-past Council (saith <hi>Binius)</hi> was that Africane Council cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the first year of Pope <hi>Coelestine,</hi> which was the year 424. after Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Helvicus;</hi> (A great distance sure from 390.) And the 37. Canon of that Africane Council, saith <hi>Binius,</hi> is that which is here related to: The like he affirms concerning <hi>Fortunatus</hi> his words in the third Canon, Memini praeterito consilio fuisse statutum, <hi>I remember in a fore-past Council it was ordained;</hi> where saith the same <hi>Binius,</hi> That fore-past Council, was the forenamed Africane, and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> reflected back to the tenth Canon of that Council; But if this Council in which were so <hi>few Bishops,</hi> and concerning which are so <hi>many uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,</hi> may deserve the credit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the particular Africane Church, yet sure it will be hard to prove, That the words alledged by you deserve to have the credit or Authority of a Canon of this Council, to that purpose <hi>for which,</hi> and according to that sense <hi>in which</hi> you have alledged them.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105952:35"/>
he then may lawfully marry, since the Apostle in saying, <hi>It is better to marry then to fornicate,</hi> hath allowed if not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e him to <hi>chose the better,</hi> and to <hi>leave the worse:</hi> And whereas you appeal to the precedent words, <hi>If they cannot contain, let them marry;</hi> the same absurdity still follows your new gloss, which is this, That the Priviledge of marriage depends upon the bestiality of fornication; for <hi>If they cannot contain,</hi> is no more then <hi>if they burn;</hi> and <hi>if they burn,</hi> in your gloss, is no less then if they fornicate; whence it follows that according to your new gloss, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath said, <hi>If they fornicate let them marry:</hi> And this is yet more palpable as the same Rule is set down in the second verse, not by way of <hi>supposition,</hi> but by way of <hi>Position,</hi> in these words, <hi>To avoid fornication let every man have his wife;</hi> for if to avoid fornication do there signifie not to avoid the <hi>danger,</hi> but only the <hi>guilt</hi> of fornication, this <hi>concession, To avoid fornication, let every man have his wife,</hi> will in effect be turned into this <hi>Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Let no man have his wife till he hath actually fornicated, and so the Laity must plunge themselves in vitiousness as well as the Clergy, if they will have wives: For

Clergy with you do so? Did not Saint <hi>Peter</hi> do this as well as Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> and yet he was doubtless a married man. But I answer, I do find that men are bid abstain from marriage to fast and pray, not that they are bid fast and pray to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from marriage; nor have Priests any particular promise more then other men, that they shall be enabled to live perpetual Virgins by fasting and praying, that so they may fast and pray in faith of that promise; nor have they any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar command more then other men to fast and pray to enable them to live perpetual Virgins, that so they may fast and pray in obedience to that command: And why should any man place Religion in that which neither is <hi>in faith,</hi> as to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; nor <hi>from obedience,</hi> as to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? And whereas you speak of your millions of good men, I heartily wish it may be more then <hi>speech;</hi> but I have a <hi>fear,</hi> a <hi>suspition,</hi> nay a <hi>proof,</hi> that hitherto it hath been no more: For first your own <hi>Panormitane,</hi> as I find him quoted by my late Reverend and Learned Diocesan Bishop <hi>Davenant,</hi> makes me <hi>fear otherwise;</hi> for he saith expreslly, Credo pro bono &amp; salute esset animarum ut volentes possent
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105952:40"/>
contrahere; <hi>I believe it would be for the good and salvation of souls, if they that will might marry:</hi> He means sure the Priests souls, and therefore thought many of them <hi>deeply</hi> plunged in sin for want of marriage.</p>
               <p>Secondly the Testimony of your own <hi>Agrippa,</hi> makes me <hi>think otherwise;</hi> for he saith plainly of your Priests &amp; Monks; Clanculum confluunt ad lupanaria, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prant sacras virgines, vitiant viduas, And puts his Quod ego scio &amp; vidi, to their clancular yet prodigious abominations, and at last thus concludes, Et quarum animas lucrari debent Deo, Illarum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora sacrificant Diabolo; Agrip. de van. scientiarum, <hi>cap.</hi> 64.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the authority of your own <hi>Espencaeus</hi> makes me <hi>say otherwise;</hi> for these are his words in his exposition, upon <hi>Titus</hi> 1. Turpissimum est quod &amp; Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos cum concubinis, pellicibus, &amp; meretri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus cohabitare, liberosque procreare sinunt, accepto ab eis, atque adeo alicubi a continentibus certo quotannis cansu: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat concubinam sive non habeat, aureum solvat &amp; habeat si velit: I should have been ashamed of quoting these three Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, had not your great boast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105952:40"/>
it, but I am ashamed to English these quotations, though by so doing I should go near to overthrow your boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Indeed your own <hi>Cassander</hi> hath overthrown it; for this is his ingenuous profession and confession in this kind, That the want of able Ministers (ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neorum Ministrorum inopia) is one cause amongst others, why the constitution which forbids the marriage of Priests in your Church, should be recalled; for that had kept many learned and picus men from the Ministry: So that for the most part no other young men entred into holy orders, but such as looked after a <hi>fat living,</hi> and a <hi>licentious life,</hi> unless it were some few who through unadvised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and inconsideration were brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the snare: Praeter nonnulios qui im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudenter &amp; nondum sibi satis noti in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queum inducuntur: And therefore saith plainly and positively, unless marriage be tolerated, they should scarce be able to find out fitting Ministers to supply the Church: Nisi conjugium toleretur, vix idonei Ecclesiae ministri in posterum qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem inveniri poterunt: Cassander in Consult. Art. 23.</p>
               <p>And now considering that Truth is

good in it self, and Virginity is good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in order to another thing, <hi>sc.</hi> to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness: let any conscientious man judge, which of the two Priests is more in the state of sin and damnation; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that is lawfully and righteously wedded to a wife, or he that is unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unrighteously wedded to such a false opinion; although as self-interest now steers Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ship, there is little <hi>hope</hi> that the one will part or be divorced from his opinion, as there is little <hi>honesty</hi> that the other should part or be divorced from his wife.</p>

               <p n="1">1. MY intent was to comfort the dying, not to contest with the living: To shew to penitent and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Christians, That for them to depart out of this life, is to be with Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was so to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and to the good thief before them: You are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lay Purgatory in their way, which I look upon as a very <hi>stumbling block,</hi> fit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make their passage hence much <hi>more formidable,</hi> and much <hi>less comfortable;</hi> Nor can I find your Commission, as you are a <hi>Christian Divine,</hi> to <hi>break a bruised reed,</hi> and <hi>quench the smoaking flax;</hi> much less to throw it into the flames, to burn and to consume it: For sure it cometh nearer the office of Christ, (which is the <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> should be the <hi>platform</hi> of yours) <hi>to preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken-hearted, to comfort them that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For our Saviour Christ requiring the Ministers of his Gospel, sparingly to use even true frights in bringing obstinate sinners to rely on his merits and mediation, will never approve those who invent false fears to scare true Penitents that are actually <hi>with him,</hi> from their comfort and hold <hi>in him.</hi> 2. But this is rather to acquit my self. I come now to answer you, and say, That Saint <hi>Paul</hi> looked upon his life as that which gave him a being with the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and therefore was more advantagious to them: But he looked upon his death as that which would give him a being with Christ, and therefore would be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to himself: This makes him desire rather to die then to live, because by his death he should so depart from the one, as to approach to the other: His dissolution was to be his admission <hi>into</hi> heaven, not his introduction <hi>towards</hi> it, to let him first into Purgatory, and from thence to transmit him unto Christ: This is Saint <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> exposition; He saith
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105952:45"/>
                  <hi>It is good to be dissolved and to be with Christ; for death or dissolution in it self is an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing, neither good nor bad; but it is bad when a man dies to be punished,</hi> (and sure Purgatory in your belief is a very great punishment) <hi>good when he so goes from men as to go to Christ:</hi> So that if you suppose his being dissolved and being with Christ were not both together in one and the same instant; Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> will tell you his dissolution was not good; and if <hi>not good,</hi> sure <hi>not desireable;</hi> And if good only <hi>for being with Christ,</hi> then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable only <hi>for that being.</hi> 3. Yet you say, All the strength of my first argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment stands upon the <hi>desire:</hi> If so, it cannot stand upon the <hi>dissolution;</hi> and then it will follow, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> might be dissolved and not be with Christ; say then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> might go to Purgatory, to make your good Catholicks the more willing to go thither after him; But first so make them <hi>good Catholicks,</hi> as not to let them be <hi>bad Christians:</hi> For their desire to die so holily as to escape Purgatory, is too servile to make them good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, even in the Heathen Poets divinity, Oderunt peccare mali formidine poenae, <hi>They are wicked men who hate to sin for fear</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:105952:45"/>
                  <hi>of Punishment;</hi> Therefore if they desire to avoid sin meerly for fear of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they are not good Catholicks: If for love of Christ, as their life is to be <hi>in him,</hi> so their death is to be <hi>with him,</hi> and that <hi>immediatly;</hi> for else not to be <hi>with him,</hi> but with some other <hi>before him;</hi> which made Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> to say concerning <hi>Nepotian,</hi> when he was but newly dead, Scimus Nepotianum nostrum esse cum Christo; corpus terra suscepit, Anima Christo red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dita est: (Hier. in Epitaph. Nepot.) <hi>We know that our</hi> Nepotian <hi>is with Christ,</hi> (you now say quite contrary, we know that he is not with Christ, for he is in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory) <hi>the earth hath his body, but his Saviour bath his soul:</hi> See how he dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth of a man that dies in the faith of Christ, His body goeth to the dust, but his soul goeth to Christ that redeemed it; Oh Sir, be not you so willing to <hi>allow,</hi> much less to <hi>make</hi> a separation betwixt Christ and good Christians, in that very instant which God hath appointed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate their Union, since you find it so expresly said, <hi>That neither death nor depth</hi> (and sure Purgatory is a depth in your account) <hi>shall be able to separate us from the Love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our</hi>

                  <hi>Lord,</hi> Rom. 8. 38. and much less shall it be able to separate us from Christ Jesus our Lord, of whom it is said, <hi>Jesus having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end,</hi> John 13. 1. Nay who hath said of himself, <hi>Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me, be where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me,</hi> Joh. 17. 24. This will of his was fulfilled not only in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who was given him by a miraculous conversion in his life, but also in the good thief, who was given him as a more mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Convert just a little before his death; yet even he was told that he should be <hi>with Christ,</hi> not with torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed souls, immediately upon his dissolution, and that in <hi>Paradise,</hi> not in <hi>Purgatory:</hi> And I cannot <hi>see,</hi> may not <hi>say,</hi> That Christ is less willing to receive those who are now given him, (or shall be given him to the worlds end) then he was to receive that thief: And therefore I still say he was <hi>no priviledged person</hi> after his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to go to bliss sooner then other Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents, though he were indeed a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged person in regard of his conversion to be made a <hi>penitent,</hi> when his fellow thief, and many others, were still left in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105952:46"/>
their impenitency, And that satisfies all the evidence you have produced against me either out of your <hi>Rhemish</hi> or out of your <hi>Romish</hi> Doctors, so that you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve your <hi>Jo. Poean, Jo. Triumphe</hi> till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion; For that evidence makes not my assertion, <hi>(of his being no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged person)</hi> any whit more inevident; For he was not priviledged as to his <hi>death;</hi> but only as to his <hi>conversion:</hi> Wherefore since our blessed Saviour is still as ready to receive other true Penitents as he was the good thief, I hope you will not say he is ready to receive them in Purgatory, not in Paradise: For sure you are, if it were to be proved (as you assert) that Christ once shewed his glory in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet he doth not now shew it there, and therefore that cannot be the place for Christian souls to go to, when they depart from hence, because Christ himself hath said concerning them, <hi>I will that they be where I am, that they may be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105952:47"/>
much doubted, whether he were once in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> because that is looked on as a fictitious Place, and so could not receive him: But in truth the words will have those who are given unto Christ, to go immediately unto Heaven; for that is our Saviours meaning, <hi>I will they be where I am,</hi> viz. in heaven, for there he then was in his Divinity (in which respect we are taught to say to him, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven)</hi> and I think you must have recourse to the Divinity of Christ to prove that the good thief enjoyed his promise to be with him that day in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, for his body was in the grave, and his humane soul in Hell, say you, and for ought we can prove, only his Divinity was in heaven: Wherefore whiles Christ was in the state of Humiliation, all those who were given him, were at their deaths with him as God; But now he is in the state of his Exaltation, all that are given him, are at their deaths with him not only <hi>as God,</hi> but also <hi>as man,</hi> that they may behold his glory, whether given him of the Father by eternal generation as God, or by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral dispensation as man; And surely if they be with him that they may behold his glory, they cannot be in Purgatory;

for neither he nor his glory is there: And how their faith can be so long suspended from Vision, their hope from comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, their charity from fruition by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition of some continuance in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, not to be measured by time, for they are past that, nor by eternity, for they are not yet come to that, I cannot see without a great injury to <hi>their soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As for those words, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth <hi>de Purgatorio incertum est;</hi> Tis clear by the context, they are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood only of the humane soul of Christ, that it is uncertain whether that were ever in Purgatory or no; for I said, The good Thief was without doubt to be with his Saviour, and therefore was to be in <hi>Paradise,</hi> not in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> since it was not without doubt that Christ was in Purgatory, but it was without doubt that he was in Paradise: And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath said thus much in sense, though not in words, and I intending to meddle only with his sense, thought it needless to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105952:48"/>
quote either Chapter or Book, since I thought his sense so known to all Papists, as not to be <hi>doubted,</hi> and so received by them as not to be <hi>denyed;</hi> For my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was a consolation of Protestants, (at such a time when they wanted it very much, and yet against such a time, when they might want it more) not a contesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Papists, and therefore I quoted only the substance of his doctrine, not the words of it, and not the <hi>place,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not the <hi>words;</hi> which is not uncouth amongst serious Divines, though, as you say, it is amongst learned Antagonists: But since you have followed this quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som age, which will not let Catholik Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and honest men, either <hi>live securely,</hi> or <hi>die peaceably,</hi> that you might be my Antagonist, and have turned that into Controversie, which I intended only for peaceable Divinity, (for I was not then in case to answer a challenge, much less to send one) you have made it necessary for me to quote the very <hi>place,</hi> that I may not be thought to have misquoted the <hi>thing.</hi> The place I pointed at in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was lib. 4. de Christo, cap. 16. (the very same which after your long excursion you have alledged, as you think, <hi>against me,</hi> but in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105952:48"/>
truth <hi>for me)</hi> Probabile est profecto Christi animam ad omnia loca inferni de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendisse, <hi>It is probable that Christs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane soul, descended to all the places of Hell;</hi> I knowing that he reckoned Purgatory for one of those places, took this for his sense, <hi>It is probable that Christs humane soul went down into Purgatory.</hi> But Logick having taught me that what was asserted only <hi>as probable,</hi> was acknowledged <hi>as uncertain,</hi> I put his sense in such words as I thought most suitable to my purpose, saying, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself confesseth De Purgatorio incertum est, that is in plain English, (since my Latine had so ill luck) Bellarmine <hi>himself confesseth it is uncertain concerning Purgatory whether Christs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane soul went thither or no;</hi> which is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own doctrine by undenyable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: For he only saith, It is probable Christs humane soul went down into Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory; which is all one as if he had said, It is uncertain that Christs humane soul went down into Purgatory: For if it be but probable it was so, it is also probable it was not so, and therefore uncertain it was so; This is all <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth <hi>say,</hi> and this is more then he doth <hi>prove:</hi> Nay his proofs make his assertion altogether

                  <hi>improbable,</hi> if not <hi>impossible:</hi> For all the proofs he brings concerning Christs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, do speak only of <hi>Hell</hi> properly so called, not of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> As that of <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentius,</hi> Ubi solebant peccatorum animae torqueri, <hi>He went thither where the souls of sinners had used to be tormented:</hi> Whereas Purgatory, though a place of torment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his doctrine, yet is it not so for the souls of <hi>sinners,</hi> but for the souls of the <hi>righteous:</hi> And that other proof he brings from all the Fathers at once, is like to this: Et ipsi patres dum describunt terrorem gehennae &amp; daemonnm in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scensu Christi, aperte indicant Christum praesentiam suam illis manifestasse. <hi>And the Fathers describing the frights and fears of Hell and the Devils in Christs descent, do plainly shew that Christ did manifest his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to them:</hi> I think you will not allow this to be spoken of Purgatory; for then you must make it all one with Hell, and take it for a place of Devils, not of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirits, which after they have been purged in flames from the reliques of their sins not expiated by their own <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer penance,</hi> nor their friends <hi>after pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> are sure to see the face of God.</p>

                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:105952:49"/>
of Christs descending into Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and this I look upon as a very great uncertainty: But you look upon this as a great certainty, in that you give a reason for it, saying, <hi>it was to take possession of his whole Kingdom;</hi> say then, Purgatory is a part of Christs Kingdom, and if Christ did not take possession of this part amongst the rest, you do nòt believe He did take possession of the whole: But take heed whiles you say so, that they who are against you and deny Purgatory, tax you not <hi>of blasphemy,</hi> for saying that which is not in being, is a part of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, (for to make Christ a King in <hi>Uto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> in a place which is not, is to make him no King:) And that they who are with you, and affect purgatory, tax you not of <hi>infidelity,</hi> for believing that Christ hath taken possession of his whole Kingdom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no better grounds, then upon a meer uncertainty.</p>

where he answers some chief doubts concerning Purgatory, as, whether it be a true real fire, and how it can act upon separated souls? and both are answered from these words, <hi>Go ye cursed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting fire:</hi> Ignem Purgatorii esse cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreum, quia in Scripturis passim poena impiorum vocatur Ignis; Et regula Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logorum est, ut verba Scripturarum acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piantur propriè, quando nihil absurdi se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur: <hi>The fire of Purgatory is corporeal; for commonly in the Scripture, the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked is called fire,</hi> (what is the punishment of the wicked to the righteous? or must men turn wicked, that they may go to Purgatory?) <hi>and it is a rule of Divines,</hi> That the <hi>words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are to be taken properly, if there follow no absurdity;</hi> and a little after, Corpora damnatorum puniuntur igne, Mat. 25.

               <p>Pray Sir, why should any Christian be taught to desire to go to that fire which was prepared <hi>for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</hi> and if he do once go thither, how shall he ever return from thence? And yet your Cardinal would have us believe Purgatory, that we may have the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to go thither; and saith, if we do not, we shall burn for ever in Hell-fire: A new Apostle sure, he speaks not only so <hi>resolutely,</hi> but likewise so <hi>authentically,</hi> yet not dropt down (as the rest) from Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> bùt from Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> as we may guess by his <hi>Thunder and Lightning,</hi> Seriously, it is a sad thought for all good Christians, that any Divine should (after <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu)</hi> dare offer <hi>strange fire,</hi> for God is not well pleased with such an offering: But it is a joyful thought for us poor Protestants, that this fire of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory is not only a <hi>strange,</hi> but also a <hi>false</hi> fire; for so we are sure it cannot <hi>burn</hi> us: Else, it seems, after it hath been <hi>your Purgatory,</hi> it should be <hi>our Hell;</hi> However it is palpable, That your Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals <hi>talk</hi> only is of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> but his <hi>proof</hi> is of <hi>Hell;</hi> Thus himself hath brought his <hi>certainties</hi> concerning Purgatory into
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105952:52"/>
                  <hi>doubts,</hi> and his <hi>doubts</hi> into <hi>nothing:</hi> Nay in truth his last doubt in this 11. Chapter is a meer nothing of it self, An per se agant istae poenae, <hi>Whether those pnnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do act upon the souls by and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</hi> For to think accidents can act of themselves, is to think them substances; and to think they can act upon immaterial souls, is to think them above the best sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; And to think they can act upon blessed souls, is to think them above the substance of substances, above God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; <hi>For the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, neither doth any grief hurt them,</hi> Wisdom 3. 1. or rather, and <hi>there shall no torment touch them;</hi> The Latine translation Et non tanget illos tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum mortis; <hi>And the torment of death shall not touch them,</hi> is too <hi>short</hi> by being too <hi>long;</hi> hath <hi>taken from</hi> the Text by <hi>add ng to</hi> it; for putting in <hi>mortis,</hi> and saying <hi>the Torment of death</hi> shall not touch them, seems to allow that <hi>Torment after death</hi> may touch them; But the Greek Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal is plain, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105952:53"/>
to that most comfortable Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation sanctified unto us by the Spirit of God which <hi>made</hi> it, and by the Son of God which <hi>used</hi> it; In manus tuas com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendo spiritum meum; <hi>Into thy hands Lord I commend my spirit;</hi> It was alwaies in thy hands, <hi>by thy dominion and Tuition;</hi> But now it is more peculiarly in thy hands, <hi>by my own resignation;</hi> The souls of the Righteous are alwaies in Gods hands as their <hi>Governor,</hi> but more peculiarly at the hour of death as their <hi>Receiver</hi> and <hi>Possessor:</hi> For they no sooner go from their own bodies, but they go into his hands; and being there, no grief can hurt them, no more then it can hurt him, or take them out of his hands: And sure we are, he will not hurt them, for he doth not receive them with <hi>one hand,</hi> that he may torment them with the <hi>other;</hi> so saith the voice from heaven, (and it is both shame and sin for any voice from earth to say otherwise) <hi>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord; for they rest from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and their works do follow them,</hi> Apoc. 14. 13. That is, their good works, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their reward, not their evil works to procure their punishment (such as you teach to be in Purgatory) for thats not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105952:53"/>
agreeable with their rest, nor consistent with their blessedness: And I desire to know how he can say to God at his death, <hi>Into thy hands I commend my spirit,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Torments of Purgatory, by which, (for ought you dare avow to the contrary) he may be in the hands of the Devil.</p>
               <p>Again, Cap. 12. Sciri non posse in hac vita, quomodo ignis corporeus Animas urat: <hi>It cannot be known in this life how material fire can burn immaterial souls;</hi> let me add, much less how it can <hi>purge</hi> them, or expiate the reliques of their sins; for though we read that fire is an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods Justice, and so may punish immaterial spirits; yet we do not read that it is an instrument of Gods Grace; that it should <hi>purge</hi> or <hi>expiate</hi> them.</p>
               <p>Cap. 13. An in purgatorio torquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Animae à daemonibus: <hi>Whether or no in Purgatory the souls are tormented by the Devils?</hi> Concerning which he answers, Res est omnino incerta: <hi>It is a a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uncertain;</hi> This is the second time he hath answered us with that very word; so we see he could be <hi>confident,</hi> where he could not be <hi>certain;</hi> But in this case we have reason to believe him; For there
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105952:54"/>
are divers several opinions concerning it; so the doctrine is <hi>uncertain as to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;</hi> and not one of those opinions but hath an objection stronger then its proof; so the doctrine is <hi>uncertain as to the belief;</hi> For some say the souls in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory are tormented by the good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; but how come they from being their friends and Guardians, to be their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and tormentors? Others say, That they are tormented by the Devils (and to this <hi>Bellarmine</hi> inclines, because forsooth the pretended Revelations have avowed it) But how comes the Devil from being <hi>conquered by them</hi> whiles they were in the infirmities of the flesh, to be a <hi>Conquerour over them</hi> when they are nothing but pure spirits? Doth God say, <hi>Resist the Devil and he will fly from you,</hi> (James 4. 7.) and shall men say, The Devil comes as a Conquerour upon them who have most resisted him? Doth the Church pray That God would <hi>beat down Satan under our feet;</hi> and have we no better benefit of that prayer, Then that God should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Satan to get up even over our Head? Others say, they are tormented by the fire, meaning I suppose, as it is directed and assisted by the hand of God; But how
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:105952:54"/>
comes God so low in their esteem as to do that, which they do not think fit to be done by his meanest good Angel? Why must that office of an <hi>Executioner</hi> become him, which is unbecoming his most infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Minister? Besides, how can his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice which hath been satisfied by Christ, require a second satisfaction? Or where hath God declared that he will allow his Justice to be thus satisfied? We dare not deny, That Gods Justice is fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Christ for penitent Sinners, because himself hath said, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased,</hi> Mat. 3. which were nothing to us, if he were not well pleased with all that flie to Christ, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that are in Christ, for Christs sake; yet sure not well pleased, if his Justice be not fully satisfied, since <hi>Justice first and then Charity,</hi> is a rule not to be violated or broken on earth, much less in heaven: Again, our blessed Saviours fore-runner thus proclaimed concerning him, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world,</hi> John 1. 29. If he hath taken them away, they cannot be <hi>left behind,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our guilt or for our punishment; since guilt is nothing else but an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to punishment; for that were to say,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105952:55"/>
He hath taken them away, so as to leave them behind, for us to take them away; which is in effect to deny him to be the <hi>Propitiation for our sins,</hi> against the express word of God, <hi>John</hi> 2. 2. and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not only against the <hi>benefits,</hi> but also against the <hi>belief</hi> of our own souls: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we dare not deny, That Gods justice is fully satisfied in Christ; and if we dare, we shall not know where to find him any other satisfaction; for he hath not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or appointed any other; and sure no satisfaction can give him content, but such as himself hath allowed and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And indeed that is the only satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is adequate to his offended Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, the satisfaction made by his <hi>Son,</hi> not by the <hi>sinner,</hi> either in doing or in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, because there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt an <hi>infinite Justice,</hi> and a <hi>finite satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:</hi> This considered, may I not be as gross an Ebionite or Cherinthian, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is a necessity of <hi>penal satisfaction,</hi> as if I say, there is a necessity of <hi>legal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations</hi> for the expiation of sin? do not both alike diminish and disparage the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Christs death? Or may I think that the Church of Christ by using the power of the Keyes in retaining sins, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends

to <hi>retain</hi> where Christ <hi>remits,</hi> to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And so Purgatory will in truth be <hi>Hell.</hi> If satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction hath been made by Christ, then none at all can justly go thither: And so Purgatory will in truth be <hi>Nothing;</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, no other satisfaction was given for all the offences of the good Thief, though he were not a Penitent till the hour of his death; and with what colour of Truth can any Divine teach that God will not take this satisfaction (and this alone) for all other Penitents? And yet this (in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> acount) is one

               <p>Nor is it to be wondered, That <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> certainties concerning this doctrine should be so much enfeebled by his own uncertainties concerning the same, no more then it is to be wondered that the certainty of our Christian saith should depend, not upon the <hi>wit</hi> of man, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>word</hi> of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

Texts that were in his daies commonly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged out of the Bible to prove Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which were then but <hi>three,</hi> though since they have swelled into a far greater number.</p>
               <p>The first Text was that of 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 12. To which his answer is, Libri Macchabae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum non sunt de Canone Bibliae, ut dicit Hieronymus; <hi>The Books of the</hi> Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees <hi>are not of the Canon of the Bible,</hi> as saith Saint <hi>Hierom:</hi> Nor doth your Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals new subtilty invalidate this answer, Dico librum Maccha. non esse Canonicum apud Judaeos, sed apud Christianos esse, <hi>I say the Books of the</hi> Macchabees <hi>were not Canonical among the Jews, but they are among the Christians;</hi> For the Christian Church had the Canon of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Church of the Jews, who not daring to make themselves a Canon, took that which God gave them, and therefore left out the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not in the Ark, that is to say, not in that Canon which God had given them: Nor hath God given the Christian Church power and authority to make that or any other Book Canonical, which himself hath not made so; for the Text is plain which saith, <hi>To them were</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:105952:58"/>
                  <hi>committed the Oracles of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 2. Which words only shew a <hi>Trust of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> not a <hi>power of making</hi> the Oracles of God, either in Jew or Christian.</p>
               <p>The second Text then alledged to prove Purgatory, was that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. To which his answer is, That the Apostle there speaketh of that fire which shall burn the world at the day of Judgement; therefore that place will not prove such a a purging by fire as the Doctors suppose, before the day of Judgement; Benè pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur Purgatio ista conflagrationis in die judicii, non ista purgatio quam Doctores ponunt ante diem judicii: Mark his words, He saith the <hi>Doctors,</hi> not the <hi>Apostles,</hi> had been the Teachers of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Yet this is the Text your Cardinal most magnifies, (lib. 1. cap. 5.) as fittest to prove both this <hi>fire</hi> and its <hi>fewel,</hi> both Purgatory and Venial sins, though a very learned interpreter of his own Church <hi>Erasmus</hi> had avowed before, that it was not sufficient to prove it either; and in truth in that himself hath confessed it to be one of the <hi>hardest</hi> Texts of all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, (unum ex difficillimis) he hath in effect discredited his own proof; For no Divine may laudably take that Text to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105952:58"/>
prove an Article of Faith, whose obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is fitter to <hi>shew</hi> men their ignorance, then to <hi>remedy</hi> it: For God doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige any man to an impossibility to believe that which he cannot know, or to know that which he cannot understand; and therefore to say the place is very obscure, and yet to ground an Article of Faith upon it, is in effect to say, There ought to be a <hi>belief</hi> where there is not an <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;</hi> or there ought to be an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing where the thing is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood: For sure God is not defective in necessaries; and therefore if this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine had been necessary to salvation, he would not have delivered it so obscurely, as to leave the unlearned under a most ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remediable ignorance, which is inconsistent with the <hi>knowledge</hi> of Faith; nor the learned under most inextricable doubts and perplexities, which are incompetible with the <hi>assent</hi> of Faith: So that this text makes no more for the belief of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then the former.</p>
               <p>The third and last Text then alledged to prove Purgatory, was that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. to which the forenamed Author answers, Non sequitur, non remittitur hic ne<expan>

I say, A Consequence without the rules of Logick, is a Lye, and I am forced to say it as a Christian Divine, That I may not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray</hi> the Truth of Christ, nor <hi>bely</hi> the Church of Christ: For how many Truths doth the Church of Christ teach me to believe, which are Divine Truths only as they are Logical Consequences, whereas it is palpable, A Logical Consequence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Truth, but an Unlogical Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence must be a Lye. I will instance but in one; The <hi>Monothelite</hi> who said Christ had but one will, is condemned for an Heretick by the sixt general Council; and yet it is only a Logical Consequence, That Christ had two wills, from this Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That two compleat rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures must have two wills; Whence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Syllogism, Two compleat rational Natures must have two wills: Christ had two compleat rational Natures, <hi>(sc.</hi> the

nature of God, and the nature of man) Therefore Christ had two wills: Here is a Truth inferred by Logical Consequence, which hath a Being in it self, and chargeth them for Hereticks who deny it, because it is a Divine Truth; whereas such infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences as are only from <hi>Prudential</hi> not <hi>Logical</hi> Consequences, have no being save in the fancy of him that makes them, and therefore Charges all with Heresie that believe them, because they are not <hi>Divine Truths,</hi> but only <hi>humane imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> For it is an heresie to believe that for a divine Truth, which God hath not taught in his Word, neither explicitly nor implicitly, neither as a <hi>doctrine,</hi> nor as a <hi>deduction;</hi> neither as a <hi>Theological Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> nor as a <hi>Logical Conclusion;</hi> For such a belief doth not only set up Fancy, or rather Falsity instead of Truth, or man instead of God for the author of our Faith, but it also disbelieveth that Truth, whereof God is the undoubted Author: For he which believeth that which God hath not taught concerning any Truth must needs in some respect not believe that which God hath taught concerning the same Truth; as in this particular case <hi>concerning the remission of sins,</hi> He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth

Per divinam Potentiam posse ab homine tolli facultatem intelligendi, interim ut maneat Homo; <hi>That by Gods Almighty power may be taken from a man the faculty of understanding, and he may still remain a man:</hi> A Consequence doubtless from the first Article of our belief (I believe in God the Father Almighty) but inferred only by the Rules of this new prudence, not by the Rules of old sound Logick, and therefore to be looked upon as a meer fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for it supposeth an Impotency in Omnipotency, as if God could deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, working contradiction, and making a man not a man, a reasonable creature not a reasonable creature at the same time and in the same respect: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this Consequence hath found us out a man fit to believe other such like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences; For such Consequences are clearly without Reason, and therefore the man that can believe them, had need be a man without Reason.</p>

I Spake not of you <hi>Catholicks,</hi> but if I spake of you, it was of you <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> who by your own <hi>Cassander</hi> are not to be called Catholicks, but false Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks: Sunt quidam qui Pontificem Romanum, tantum non Deum faciunt, ejusque autoritatem non modò supra to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam Ecclesiam, sed supra ipsam Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram divinam efferunt: Hos non video quò minus Pseudocatholicos &amp; Papistas appellare possis: (Cassander de officio pii viri:) <hi>There are some who make the Pope almost a God, and extoll his authority not only above the whole Church, but also above the holy Scripture: These are to be called Papists and Pseudocatholicks, that is to say, false Catholicks:</hi> Wherefore in the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105952:74"/>
judgement of your own <hi>Cassander,</hi> if you will needs be Papists, you cannot be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But in truth my intent was not so much to speak in condemnation of you <hi>Papists,</hi> as in justification of us <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants;</hi> not so much in condemnation of your Church, as in justification of our own: But since you have taken it for a condemnation of your Church, pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether you may not take these particulars for the parts of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
               <p>First that in your General confession, Confitior Deo omnipotenti, &amp; B. Mariae semper Virgini, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You suppose the blessed Virgin, and the holy Apostles Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the Saints departed, equally present at your Confession with God to hear you, if not equally powerful or merciful with him to forgive you; whereas we who are taught only to say, Omnipotens &amp; clementissime Pater, <hi>Almighty and most merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> in our general Confession, cannot be under the suspition, much less under the danger of communicating to the creature either the presence, or power, or mercy of the Creator.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:105952:74"/>
Secondly, That in your particular and private confession, you clog mens consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with an absolute necessity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing every mortal sin, though it be but only in thought: For so saith your <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane</hi> Council under <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, (cap. 21.) Omnia sua peccata fideliter confiteatur, <hi>Let him faithfully confess all his sins:</hi> And though that of <hi>Trent</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards seem to mitigate the matter (sess. 14. c. 5.) saying, Nihil aliud exigit Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia à Poenitentibus quàm ut confiteantur omnia peccata mortalia, quae post diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem sui excussionem memoriae occurrent; Yet Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whom his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Jesuites will certainly follow (and they are now your chiefest confessors) saith plainly, after a full debate of the cause, Colligimus hinc necessarium esse confiteri omnia peccata mortalia, etiamsi solâ cogitatione commissa sint (lib. 3. de Poenit. cap. 7. § ex his) so that tis to little purpose for your Council to say that tis necessary for the Penitent to confess all the mortal sins he can remember, whiles your Champion, and after him your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, say, tis necessary for him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess all the mortal sins he hath committed, and spare him not so much as a thought,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105952:75"/>
which may easily be a mortal sin, and yet is as easily forgotten as committed; whence it was that your own <hi>Cassander</hi> called your auricular confession Carnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>einam conscientiarum (in consult. Art. 11.) the wrack of consciences, to <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> not to <hi>ease</hi> them; <hi>For who can tell how oft he offendeth! O cleanse thou me from my secret faults,</hi> said the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> after Gods own heart, <hi>Psalm</hi> 19. If none can tell how oft he offendeth in word or deed, much less in thought, who is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess all his offences? yet you say, He must confess all, or he can receive pardon of none: And therefore as you leave the horrour of that question upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, <hi>Who can tell how oft he offendeth?</hi> So you take away the comfort of that prayer from it, <hi>O cleanse thou me from my secret faults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That in your absolutions you remit the punishments of Purgatory, for all the sins committed against God and man: Remitto tibi omnes poenas Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorii propter culpas &amp; offensiones quas contra Deum &amp; proximum tuum commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisti: This was the form of that Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Dr. <hi>Harding</hi> brought over from <hi>Rome</hi> to bestow amongst those of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105952:75"/>
his party in this Nation, who would joyn with him in his dis-allegiance against Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> I meddle not with its vanity, in absolving from Punishments which are not in being, or if they were, cannot come under the Churches absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I meddle only with its Impiety, that it turneth the gift of God into the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ungodliness: For no credulous Papist that believes the torments of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, can stick to do any Villany, if he may be thus absolved for doing it: And it is to be seared that some of your party still heighten their absolutions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their designs, which is little less then to make the power of God sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to the malice of the Devil; and to fill the hearts of men with impiety that they may commit sin, and with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency when they have committed it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This and much more might have been said by way of condemning your Church; but I desired only to acquit our own, and to shew that if we would our selves, we might all be sincere and true Penitents, because our Church was not <hi>really</hi> but only <hi>seemingly</hi> defective in the practice of Pennance; For though she
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105952:76"/>
wracked no mans conscience, yet she so far instructed all, that not the meanest of her Communicants who were not Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, could be under the <hi>danger,</hi> and much less under the <hi>guilt</hi> of Impenitency. And I had reason to satisfie my self and others in this point; for it is evident by Saint <hi>John</hi> Baptists first Sermon, Mat. 3. 8, 9. <hi>[Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance, and think not to say within your selves, we have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father:]</hi> That it is in vain for any man to boast he hath <hi>Abraham</hi> for his Father, or as we Christians use to speak, He hath the Church of Christ for his Mother, who is not a true Penitent: Nay it is in vain for any Church to boast of her being the daughter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the Spouse of Christ, if she follow not his example who first Preached Christ, calling upon all that are of her Baptism, and are associated in her Communion, <hi>To bring forth fruits meet for Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And upon this ground did <hi>Lactantius</hi> determine so positively, <hi>That the true Church of Christ was to be known only by the practice of Pennance;</hi> Lib. 4. de vera sap. cap. 30. Sed tamen quia singuli qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que caetus Haereticorum, se potissimum
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105952:76"/>
Christianos, &amp; suam esse Catholicam Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam putant, sciendum est illam esse ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, in quâ est Confessio &amp; Poenitentia, quae peccata &amp; vulnera quibus subjecta est imbecillitas carnis, salubriter curat; <hi>But because the several Congregations of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks think themselves the best Christians, and each his own Church to be the Catholick Church, we must know That is the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, in which there is Confession and Penance, to take care for the healing of those sins and wounds which the infirmities of the flesh bring upon us:</hi> He saith the Catholick Church is to be known by <hi>an Healing Confession</hi> and <hi>an Healing Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi> the same in effect which Saint <hi>John</hi> Baptist had said before him; I knowing that those words, <hi>Confession</hi> and <hi>Penance,</hi> made more noise in your Church then in <hi>ours,</hi> was willing to examine, whether we had not the same <hi>vertue</hi> of them amongst us, to heal us, as was amongst you, to heal you, because we had not the same <hi>noise</hi> of them; And I found we had; For besides the greater censure of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication in the power of the Bishops, and the lesser censure of abstention in the power of all Parochial Priests, enabling and requiring them to deny the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105952:77"/>
to scandalous sinners, till they had testified their repentance for their sins, I fòund that every one of us was put under a necessity of censuring and condemning himself, which was the readiest way to bring us all to an ingenuous confession of our sins, and to a serious contrition for them: For being bound in our daily pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayers to hear the Ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the mouth of the Priest as from the mouth of God, kneeling upon our knees, and to say at the end of every Commandement, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us;</hi> We could not justly be charged for want of an Healing Confession, (to let pass that at the beginning of our prayers) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no sin but was against some one of Gods Commandements; and we asking mercy for our transgression of every one, did in effect confess our transgressing it: And being also bound to say, <hi>Encline our hearts to keep this Law,</hi> we could not justly be charged for want of an <hi>healing Penance,</hi> because that wholly consisted in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and conversion of the Heart: That Penance most <hi>healing</hi> the soul, which had most <hi>broken</hi> the heart; <hi>A broken and a contrite heart, O God shalt thou not despise;</hi> For this Contrition as it is true Penance,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105952:77"/>
so it is sufficient for wiping away of all sin from the soul; your own Cardinal not only <hi>asserting</hi> but also <hi>assuring</hi> this for true doctrine, (Bellar. li. 2. de de Poenit. cap. 15.) Utrum omnia peccata per ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram contritionem sive Poenitentiam dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur? Resp. Illud autem affirmamus, non ut probabile sed planè ut certum &amp; apud Catholicos exploratum, nullam esse pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum multitudinem vel gravitatem, quae per veram poenitentiam non expie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; nam Ezech. 18. &amp; 33. Deus saepius clamat Nolo mortem Peccatoris, &amp; sine ullâ exceptione veniam pollicetur omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um iniquitatum, si impium serio paenitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit vitae praeteritae cum emendationis proposito; <hi>Whether all sins are blotted out by true Contrition or Penance? I answer, we affirm this not only as probable, but also as certain and unquestionable amongst Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, That there is no multitude or mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitud: of sins which is not expiated by true Penance; For God himself,</hi> Ezech. 18. &amp; 33. <hi>often saies</hi> (nay swears) <hi>I will not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>eath of a sinner, and promises forgiveness without exception, of áll iniquities whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if the wicked earnestly repent of his sinful life past, and truly purpose amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the time to come;</hi> Here you see he
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105952:78"/>
takes true Contrition and Penance for one and the same, and saies, That is true Contrition, when the wicked earnestly repents of what is past, and really pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth amendment for what is to come; We have this earnest Repentance profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and practised in our Church; for we say, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and encline our hearts to keep this Law;</hi> And we have also this real purpose of amendment; for after our repenting we say, <hi>And write all these thy Laws in our hearts we beseech thee;</hi> So that having this true Contrition, it cannot be denyed but we have also true Penance amongst us, that is, such a Penance as doth expiate our sins, though never so many and great, heal our wounds, and save our soul: If such an Healing Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as this, may not be had without an Healing Confession, it is plain we have also an Healing Confession amongst us, because we have this Healing Penance; If it may, tis as plain we need no other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, then that we have: I desire not to implead your Church concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Penance, for I see our own wishes it might be restored: But I crave leave to say, That our Church which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth us to lay open our consciences
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:105952:78"/>
daily before the searcher of hearts, doth not permit us to conceal any one sin in our confession, nor retain and keep back any one sin from our Penance, but biddeth us follow the example of <hi>David,</hi> saying, <hi>Try me O God, and seek the ground of my heart, prove me and examine my thoughts, look well if there be any way of wickedness in me, and lead me in the way everlasting,</hi> Psalm 139. You cannot say, He conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any one sin in his Confession, though he had not the Priests Interrogatories; for he desires God to examine and to interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate him; <hi>Interoga me,</hi> saith your Latine; Nor can you say he retained or kept back any one sin from his Penance, though he had not the Priest for his Penitentiary; for he had God instead of him; <hi>Mark well if there be any way of wickedness in me, and lead me</hi> (from that perishing way) <hi>into the way everlasting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. I heartily wish I could say the same of your Church, which requireth the people to say open their consciences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Priest, That she did not permit the people to conceal any one sin in their Confession, nor retain and keep back any one sin from their Penance: For I am so far from envying for your sakes who
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:105952:79"/>
alone would be thought to sit in <hi>Moses</hi> his Chair, that as he wished all the Lords people were Prophets, so I heartily wish all the Lords people among you were Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents; for then we should have less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and more piety and peace on both sides then now we have, either within us or without us. But as there is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to fear that a late faction among us by putting down the Ten Commandements as they were repeated with our Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Penance, hath not only suppressed the practice, but also banished the very thought of Repentance from some men, no less then the desire of Innocency from themselves: so there is great reason to believe, that a late faction among you, by putting no interrogatory upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandement, and putting all other sins into interrogatories, hath not only suppressed the practice, but also ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the very thought of repentance both in themselves and others, as to all the sins that are generally committed amongst you, against the rule of that Commandement: And surely there may be sins not only of Ignorance, but also of Infirmity and of Presumption committed against the second Commandement, as
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105952:79"/>
well as against any of the other, <hi>of</hi> which sins there should be a Confession, and <hi>for</hi> which sins there should be a Penance, as well as <hi>of</hi> and <hi>for</hi> the sins against any of the other Commandements: For the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandement being as moral as the rest, is as capable of being transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as the rest; and why then should your Interrogatories upon the seventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement (in true account, though the sixt in yours,) be so many and gross, as almost to lead even your very Priests into Temptation, and yet so few or none at all, upon the second, as not to lead your people out of it? Si cognovit faeminam in vase naturali vel extra vas, is such a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion as may justly come under an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict; for God plainly forbids all such ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauldry which leads men into sin, Ephes. 5. 3. <hi>Let it not once be naemed among you as becometh Saints;</hi> And Colos. 3. 8. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>filthy communication</hi> is to be put out of the mouth, not taken into it, for fear it should pass from the <hi>mouth</hi> into the <hi>heart;</hi> But <hi>si adoravit imaginem,</hi> if he hath falen down and worshipped an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, is such a question as ought not to be omitted in your Penitential Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, because God hath forbidden such a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:105952:80"/>
worship, and hath commanded such a worshipper to repent, and the goodness of God leading him to repentance, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 2. 4.) it is the wickedness of man to keep him from it: And truly the practice of your Church doth not lead such a sinner to repentance, but rather doth confirm him in his impenitency: For seeing so many interrogatories upon all the other Commandements, not only for Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in thought, word, and deed, but also for Omissions, and seeing none at all upon the second Commandement, he is thereby confirmed that there can be no sin against that Commandement, and so no repentance needful concerning it: By which means he is in danger not to repent truly of any sin; This general Axiome, <hi>He that offends in one point is guilty of all,</hi> being as undenyably true concerning each point of repentance, as concerning each point of obedience; for by the witting and willing neglect of repentance no less then of obedience in any one particular, Gods authority is equally contemned, and Christian Charity is equally violated; And though I doubt not but God graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously accepts of your Peoples unfeigned repentance, because being <hi>cordial</hi> for the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105952:80"/>
sins they know, it is <hi>effectual</hi> for the sins they know not; yet sure your Priests do not discharge their duties so conscionably as they ought, who keep the people from knowing their sins against the second Commandement; for by that means they do keep some from being true Penitents, &amp; do not take a right course to make any one a true Penitent. Do you think God will forget this his own Commandement in his last sentence, because you are now willing to forget it in your examinations? If not, why should you thus betray the souls committed to your charge, not teaching them to judge themselves, that they may not be condemneded of the Lord? For even your method of Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> 1556. which pretends fully to shew all sins and their remedies, (in qua peccata &amp; eorum remedia plenis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simè continentur) yet quite leaves out the second Commandement; for thus it summs up the Precepts of the Decalogue, Unum crede Deum, <hi>Believe in one God,</hi> for the first; Ne jures vana per ipsum, <hi>Take not his name in vain,</hi> for the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and more at large so sets them down in the Titles of the two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Chapters, that we cannot think the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105952:81"/>
omission of the second Commandement the fault of your <hi>Poetry,</hi> but of your <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity;</hi> So you see it was not out of any humour of quarrelsomness, but meerly out of zeal to godliness, that I hinted the defect of your Confessional Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But it seems by you, It is not only the <hi>practice,</hi> but also the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of your Church, That there needs no repentance for any sin against the second Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and you think to justifie this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, first by making no second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and then by making no sin against it: First by making no second Commandement; For you say, <hi>Saint</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine <hi>and all Catholick Divines after, reckon these two but as one.</hi> Secondly by making no sin against the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, for you say, <hi>It is impossible for Christians well instructed in the first, to offend through ignorance against the second.</hi> I answer first in general, That there is no Catholick Divinity, either in the one, or in the other; either in making the second no Commandement, or in making no sin through ignorance against it: For the Ten Commandements of the Decalogue are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ess fundamentals in regard of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105952:81"/>
our Charity, then the twelve Articles of the Apostles Creed are fundamentals in regard of our Faith; and it is as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to abolish or confound an Article, as to abolish or confound a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and you may as well say, there may be no errour of ignorance against one of the Articles, as that there may be no sin of ignorance against one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: For the Decalogue is <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolum agendorum,</hi> as the Creed is <hi>Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum credendorum;</hi> the one is a short sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie of Duties to be practised, as the other of Truths to be believed; and all the Decalogue is as necessary to salvation as all the Creed; for as he that dis-believes any one Article is in the state of <hi>damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> so he that disobeyes any one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; And as God requires us to know and believe every particular Article, at least in the purpose and preparation of our souls, that we may be saved; so also to know and obey every particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, dispencing no more with our <hi>dis-obedience,</hi> then with our <hi>dis-belief;</hi> and exacting as much our knowledge <hi>of,</hi> and obedience <hi>to</hi> his Commands, as our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and our belief of his Promises; both Faith and Obedience must be alike, as to

the <hi>perfection of parts,</hi> though neither is or can be as to the <hi>perfection of degrees:</hi> As our faith is not a true faith able to save, us unless in our desire we perfectly believe all that God hath revealed to us; so our charity is not a true charity able to save us, unless in our desires we perfectly fulfill all that God hath commanded us: For God accepting through Christ the will for the deed both in our believing, and in our obeying, doth so accept us in his Son, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He takes that for a true faith which saith, <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief;</hi> because it desires to believe whatever he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for the object of faith; He takes that for a true Charity which saith, <hi>We are not able of our-selves, as of our-selves, to think a good thought,</hi> because it desires to perform whatever he hath proposed as the object of our obedience; <hi>There is his gracious accepting us in his Son:</hi> But he takes not that for a true faith which saith concerning the least title of his revealed Truth, <hi>I will not believe;</hi> for that is to question his being the first Truth; nor that for a true Charity which saith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the least title of his imposed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>I will not obey;</hi> for that is to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:105952:82"/>
his being the last or chiefest good; <hi>There is his not denying himself:</hi> God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts us in his Son by taking the will for the deed, both in our Faith and in our Obedience; but he denyes not himself by allowing us to believe or obey according to our own wills; for what we want of actual conformity to his will in our righteousness, we are bound to make up by a potential conformity to his will in our repentance; which is a plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that God accepts not of <hi>half-Christians,</hi> either in <hi>believing</hi> or in <hi>obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but will have us put on <hi>All Christ,</hi> before he will accept us <hi>in Christ,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apostles exhortation, <hi>Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> Rom. 13. 14. that is, Put him on no less as your <hi>Lord</hi> to be ruled and governed by his commands, then as your <hi>Jesus</hi> to be revived by the purchase and promise, or to be anointed with the joy and gladness of his salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For a meer speculative knowledge of the divine promises can bring no man to Christ, without a practical knowledge and love of the Divine Commands; and therefore the doctrine of the moral Law is as necessary to us Christians, both to be known and to be practised, as it was to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105952:83"/>
the Jews; and consequently whatsoever is propounded in the Decalogue, is so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fundamental in joyning us to Christ the foundation, that as it must be obeyed to keep us from refractoriness, <hi>which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates the will,</hi> so it must be taught to keep us from ignorance and from errour, <hi>which separates the understanding</hi> from the blessed Redeemer and lover of our souls. For as the Creed doth teach us to know God in Christ, as he will be known; so the Decalogue doth teach us to worship God in Christ, as he will be worshipped; The same Messias <hi>who came to teach us all things,</hi> hath not only said, <hi>This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent,</hi> John 17. 3. but also, <hi>I know that his commandement is life everlasting,</hi> John 12. 50. As his Creed is life eternal which teacheth us to know God in Christ, so his commandment is life eternal which teacheth us to love and obey God in Christ; <hi>I know that his commandement is life everlasting.</hi> If Christ know it, the Christian may not doubt it, much less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it: And therefore he that denyes or eludes any Commandement in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, is in as great danger of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

as he that denyes or eludes any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Creed; For a false tenent in matters of obedience against any one Commandement, is an heresie in practicks and destroyes salvation, if it be unrepent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even as a false tenent in matters of Faith against any one Article of the Creed, is an heresie in speculatives: So saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, shall inherit the Kingdom of God:</hi> As if the Apostle had said, It is no less damnable to err in the principles of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, then in those of speculation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he supposeth these also may be Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, saying unto them, <hi>Be not deceived;</hi> For corruption of judgement in duties of life may make an Heretick, as much as in Articles of Faith, especially if it be in any principle or ground of the Law; as he which thinks he may be a Rebel or an Idolator, and yet inherit the Kingdom of God, is as much deceived, as he which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes the Communion of Saints, and yet
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105952:84"/>
thinks to be saved: For he doth impinge in as fundamental a point, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently incurrs a most pernicious and damnable heresie: For a Practical truth declared in any Commandement, is a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truth, and challengeth our knowledge and belief no less then a specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative truth declared in an Article of faith.</p>

Catholicism, that is to say, the Profession of A Divine Truth alwaies taught in the Church of God: And if I prove both these, I hope you will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after allow the Commandement an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory in your Confessions, if not a distinct place in your Catechisms: First I say, it is against essential Catholicism, that is, against the substance of a divine truth taught by God himself; For the Commandements are called by Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, <hi>Ten words,</hi> Exod. 34. 28.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which hath ever been the usual appellation in all Christian Churches, to say, The Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue or Ten words, for the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: And <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 13. tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said that God writ these Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements upon two Tables of stone; As many words as he writ with his finger, we must read with our eyes, hear with our ears, and obey with our hearts; and as many words as he writ in each Table, so many must we read, hear, and obey in it, neither more nor less, if we will have our Divinity come from God; or in vain shall we talk of being Catholicks with his Church, whiles we are Schismaticks from
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:105952:92"/>
himself; for the reason why we may not separate from his Church, is because his Church doth not separate from him; Considering then That God writ these Ten distinct words in Two distinct Tables, it must needs be uncatholick either to make no distinct word of <hi>Gods second word</hi> in the first Table, or to make two distinct words of <hi>Gods last word</hi> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table: For most Catholick is that saying of our blessed Saviour, Mat. 19. 6. <hi>What God hath joyned together, let not man put asunder;</hi> From whence by the Rule of Conversion emergeth this other, What God hath put asunder, let not man joyn together; The first Proposition will not allow us to divide the Tenth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into two, because God hath made it but one; so we must have but six Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements in the second Table: The second Proposition will not allow us to make the first and second Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into one, because God hath made them two; and so we must have full four Commandements in the first Table; For neither fewer words then <hi>four</hi> were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Gods own hand in the first, nor more then <hi>six</hi> in the second Table; And the Church of God may not be said to have <hi>power,</hi> may not be thought to have
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:105952:93"/>
                  <hi>will,</hi> to correct Gods own Hand-writing: For the same God who hath given us <hi>Ten words</hi> in both Tables, hath also given us <hi>four</hi> in the one, and <hi>six</hi> in the other: And doubtless he that telleth the number of the stars, will not learn of man how to number his own Commandements: Wherefore if our number disagree from his, we shall not only have a false piece of Arithmetick in the <hi>numerus numerans,</hi> in the number numbering; but we shall also have a false piece of Divinity in the <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus numeratus,</hi> in the number number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For we shall call that First which God calls Second, <hi>there is the false Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitick;</hi> and we shall make that nothing, which God hath made a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or make that two, which God hath made but one, <hi>there is the false Divinity:</hi> Therefore as we may not leave Gods own hand-writing to consult with the Church about the number of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whether there be Ten or no; so neither may we leave it to consult about the number of the Commandements in each Table, whether three or four in the first; for God hath said <hi>four;</hi> whether six or seven in the second Table; for God hath said <hi>six;</hi> And what God hath made his Determination, the Church of God
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:105952:93"/>
may not make her Consultation; It is the doctrine of your own Casuist, (Reginald in praxi fori Poenit. lib. 13. c. 15.) Ut omnia rerum genera ad decem summa re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducuntur, sic omnia praecepta moralia ad decem praecipua, quae Decalogum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituunt, ex quorum etiam distinctione, sicut res ex distinctione summorum gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum inter se distinguuntur: <hi>As all things which have a natural being are reduced to the Ten Predicaments: So all things that have a moral being are reduced to the Ten Commandements: And as natural entities are distinguished by the Ten Predicaments, so moral entities are distinguished by the Ten Commandements.</hi> So that the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, are as it were the Ten Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments or general heads in Divinity, to which all moral Duties are to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by which they are to be examined, &amp; from which they are to be Practised: And therefore as he would shew himself no good Logician, who should expunge or confound any one of the ten Predicaments because that were to disturb the order of nature; so he would shew himself no good Divine, who should either expunge or confound any one of the Ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, because that were to disturb the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105952:94"/>
order of Grace; The one would bring <hi>Babel</hi> upon our <hi>natural,</hi> the other upon our <hi>spiritual</hi> inheritance; The one would confound us in regard of <hi>earth,</hi> the other in regard of <hi>heaven;</hi> The one would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found us as <hi>men,</hi> the other would confound us as <hi>Christians,</hi> which is infinitely the more dreadful and the more damnable confusion: Therefore we must needs say and believe, That there is a much greater necessity of distinct entities in morals, then in naturals, because there is a much greater necessity that we should exactly know our Duties, then that we should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly know our estates or habilements; That we should know our God, then that we should know the world; And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, any true Christian Church which teacheth us in morals, must much more abhor to confound a <hi>

                     </gap>ommandement,</hi> for fear she should perplex us in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then the most careful Tutor, that teacheth us in naturals, canabhor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a <hi>Predicament,</hi> for fear he should perplex us in our learning: For there is no such desperate perplexity as that of Conscience, and no such damnable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion as that of Religion; and God hath ordained and commanded his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105952:94"/>
Church to <hi>prevent</hi> and to <hi>redress,</hi> not to <hi>create</hi> or to <hi>continue</hi> either such perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or such confusions: And a late facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in your Church, by either expunging or abridging the second Commandement, (for in some Catechisms it is expunged, in others it is abridged, for fear if it were read out all at length, it should either stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the people by the <hi>plainness of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,</hi> or else awake and frighten them by the <hi>terribleness of its commination)</hi> have brought two great absurdities upon the outward Profession of your Religion, which I may not be ashamed to name, whiles you are not afraid to practise; First that in this point it is less certain, then was the Religion of the Jews; for they had no confusion in their principles concerning the outward worship of God, as you have; and where is confusion, there must be uncertainty. Secondly that in this respect it is more scandalous and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive, then was sometime the Religion of the Heathen; For <hi>Numa</hi> would not allow any image to be made of God (saith <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his life) because he was a <hi>mind invisible,</hi> and therefore neither to be represented nor worshipped by any image; But you will needs both repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105952:95"/>
and worship him by images: Why should any Christians do that against the Law of God, which some Heathen would not do against the Law of nature? For if <hi>the Gentiles which had not the Law, doing by nature the things contained in the Law, were a Law unto themselves, and shewed the work of the Law written in their hearts,</hi> by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining from so gross Idolatry: what can be said in excuse of those Christians who have the same Law of nature as fully written in their hearts, and more fully written in the Holy Scriptures, yet will not do by Grace the things contained in the Law, nor shew the work of the Law written in their hearts and in their Bibles, but will needs be a Law unto themselves against the Law of God and nature, that they may be and continue most gross Idolaters? I could wish with all my soul that the question were imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently asked, because I fear it cannot be substantially answered; and if it may stand good without an answer, it will not only be a most harsh question, but also a most heavy accusation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this reckoning the First and Second but as one Commandement, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so against accidental Catholicism, that is
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:105952:95"/>
to say, against the Profession of a Divine Truth, universally taught in the Church of God by the Jews and by the Christians, both before and after Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> daies; For the Jews Church, we have the testimony of <hi>Josephus,</hi> who lib. 3. Antiq. cap. 4. hath these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>The first Commandement teacheth us There is but one God, and that we must worship him alone; The second commandeth us not to worship him by any image.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Christian Church, we have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the Testimony of all the Fathers before Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and of all the writers after him, till the Schoolmen; and we have his too, as to the <hi>force</hi> and <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> of the second Commandement, though not as to the <hi>place</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of it.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:105952:98"/>
for the enumeration of all the prohibited particulars in an universal negative being impossible, to particularize in some few only as prohibited, is in effect to leave those which are not particularized or enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated out of the Prohibition; and therefore we may not think those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which are set down in the Tenth Commandement, to be set there by way of <hi>enumeration,</hi> as if they were <hi>All,</hi> but only by way of <hi>instance</hi> or <hi>exposition,</hi> as being the <hi>most notorious;</hi> And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently one and the same Prohibition, <hi>Thou shalt not covet,</hi> must be extended to them All alike, and then pass from those particulars till it come to this universal, <hi>Nor any thing that is his;</hi> So that this is in truth the Tenth Commandement, <hi>Thou shalt not covet any thing that is thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;</hi> for we cannot make it an universal Negative, unless we suppose it but one universal Prohibition, concerning all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of concupiscence, forbidding inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the first motions and affections thereof, and the consent to either; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, the leud significations or expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and much more the completion and custom of concupiscence; All these are alike forbidden in the Tenth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

by one &amp; the same universal Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; And if it be but one Prohibition, it cannot be two Precepts; and if it be two Precepts, it cannot be one Prohibition, &amp; so it must come from an universal nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, forbidding all concupiscence to be a particular negative, forbidding some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, and consequently licencing that which it hath not forbidden.</p>

                  </gap> in Greek being translated by your own Vulgar Interpreter, <hi>simula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra</hi> in Latine) as a part of the worship of the true God, is to communicate with those who did worship false Gods, that is, with the Heathen, who worshipped their false Gods, (or rather Devils) by Idols and Images: The same is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, 1 Cor. 10. That the <hi>Israelites</hi> who did <hi>eat of the sacrifices, were partakers of the Altar,</hi> v. 18. that is, by eating of the sacrifices, did shew their Communion in the <hi>Mosaical</hi> rites and ceremonies; from whence he inferrs this conclusion, That for any man to eat things offered unto Idols, is to communicate with Idolators in their idolatry, and that is no less then to forsake the Communion of God, and to have Communion with Devils, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21. And I hope you will say there is little reason and less Religion, for any Divine to averr, That Christians may not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:105952:99"/>
indeed communicate in things offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Idols, but yet they may communicate in the Idols themselves, without being Idolaters; that is, without breaking Communion with God, or beginning Communion with Devils: For if they be Idolaters, they must do both; and they may be Idolaters not only by committing Idolatry, but also by communicating in it: Therefore as God had before said to the Jews, <hi>[You shall make you no Idols nor image to bow down to it, for I am the Lord,</hi> Levit. 26. 1.] So after that he said also to the Christians, <hi>Wherefore my Beloved, flee from Idolatry,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 14. and used the same reason as before, but much more fully explained, for as he said to the Jew, <hi>I am the Lord;</hi> so he said to the Christian, <hi>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of Devils; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord Table, and of the table of Devils;</hi> as if he had said, Unless you will forsake my Communion who am <hi>your Lord,</hi> and unless you will needs communicate with Devils who are <hi>mine enemies,</hi> you must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from this and all other idolatrous rites and ceremonies in my worship, which have been used by the Heathen in their worship, and particularly from
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:105952:100"/>
Idols, for I will not be worshipped by you as the Devil was worshipped by them, <hi>with Idols or Images;</hi> This is the general reason which God himself gives of the Prohibition, <hi>For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God;</hi> and this reason without doubt did not then more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the <hi>Jew,</hi> then it doth now concern the <hi>Christian;</hi> for God is now as jealous of his Honour and Worship, as he was then, and hath as great cause for his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie. 2. We ought to follow God, and think it both possible and easie for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians well instructed in the first, to offend through ignorance against the second Commandement: For the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement hath its own peculiar and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct moralitie from the first, not only that it prohibiteth <hi>external,</hi> when the first prohibiteth <hi>internal</hi> Idolatry, (as you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) but also because the first treateth of the <hi>Object,</hi> the second of the <hi>Manner</hi> of our religious worship, and therefore is as liable to be transgressed through ignorance, as the first; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Saint <hi>Johns</hi> rule, <gap reason="foreign">

Israel, <hi>which brought thee up out of the Land of</hi> Aegypt; How are not those Christians ignorant Idolators, who say to a piece of wood, <hi>Thou hast redeemed us, Thou hast reconciled us unto God?</hi> Neither perchance to be called Idolators through ignorance against the first Commandement, in the <hi>undue object of worship,</hi> for that was God; yet both alike gross Idolators against the second Commandement, (either through ignorance or through presumption; and my charity bids me say through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) in the <hi>undue manner of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping;</hi> for God will not be worshipped by any Image or Representation.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But that brings me upon your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond position, which concerns <hi>the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of our blessed Saviour by his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;</hi> and I think that also very false and dangerous Divinity, both in the specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and in the practice, both to be taught and to be followed; For surely we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians may not worship our Saviour Christ by any Image, because <hi>as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> we believe him to be <hi>God of God, light of light, very God of very God, begotten not made, being of one substance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by whom all things were made;</hi> and we cannot deny but <hi>as God</hi> he forbids him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:105952:101"/>
to be worshipped by pictures or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages: So that here I may justly retort your own argument against you; For you in effect say, That because Jesus Christ is the true God, therefore he may be worshipped by an image: But it is quite contrary; for therefore he may not be worshipped by an Image, because he is the true God: Or to set it down in your own words, <q>[It must first be proved that Jesus Christ is a false God, before the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of our divine worship through his pictures unto him can be convinced of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry]</q> For because Jesus Christ is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controversie the true, not a false God; therefore the application of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship through a picture unto him, is idolatry; for it is the true God which forbids himself to be worshipped by an image; for it is the true God which being an infinite, eternal, incorruptible Spirit, òught not, cannot either be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented or worshipped by a finite, a momentary, a corruptible Image; and this himself hath taught us saying, <hi>For I the Lord,</hi> there is his Omnipotency; <hi>Thy God,</hi> there is his All-sufficiency; do not you then think he may be described by a picture the workmanship of your hands;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:105952:102"/>
for that is to think him neither omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent nor all-sufficient; Do not you think he may be worshipped through a picture which himself hath so expresly forbidden; for that is in effect to deny him to be your Soveraign Lord. For if he be the Lord, ascribe unto him that worship and honour which himself hath commanded, not that which himself hath forbidden, because you cannot ascribe unto the Lord the honour due unto his <hi>Name,</hi> whiles you do not ascribe unto him the honour due unto his <hi>Nature;</hi> that is, the honour of being the Lord: For this is to say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> according to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the first Commandement, whiles by your breaches of the second, you force him to say unto you, <hi>I know you not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye workers of iniquity;</hi> so far is it from Truth, That Christians well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the first, cannot through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance offend against the second Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; yet I will strive to make it true for truths sake, by annexing to it this supposition, <hi>if they exactly follow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions given them in the first Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> for then clearly they will know God too well either to worship him by an image, or to worship any image in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:105952:105"/>
cannot be God; what is God, cannot be neighbour; And the Acts concerning these are as distinct as the Objects; for all the Acts commanded or forbidden in the first Table concern our God; All the Acts commanded or forbidden in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, concern our neighbour; and tis equally absurd, to apply to neighbour the Duties belonging to God, as Glory or Worship; and to apply to God the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging to neighbour, as relief or maintenance: This is the Divinity God himself hath taught; for it is the plain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted sense of his Commandements; and this is the Divinity Gods Church hath learned and professed; for thus she understood his sense, as saith <hi>Lactantius,</hi> (lib. 6. cap. 10.) Primum Justitiae offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um est conjungi cum Deo, secundum cum homine; sed illud primum Religio dicitur, Hoc secundum misericordia vel humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas nominatur; <hi>The first office of Justice is to unite man to God; The second to unite man to man, or to his neighbour: The first office is called Religion, the second is called Humanity:</hi> And therefore it is against the very order of Justice to confound these offices; For as <hi>Humanity</hi> cannot extend to <hi>God,</hi> so <hi>Religion</hi> cannot extend to <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:</hi>

Wherefore since all Communion is founded in Justice, those who most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the offices of Justice, are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est enemies and opposers of true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Communion; and consequently, They who worship Saints and Angels, are the greatest <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> because they most confound the Offices of Justice, doing to <hi>neighbour</hi> those offices which belong to <hi>God,</hi> and not doing to God those offices which belong to him; For he that renders to <hi>Caesar</hi> Gods due, doth for that cause not render to God his own due: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly these two are disjoyned and divided as two distinct offices of Justice by Gods own eternal Wisdom and Truth; and therefore may not be confounded without mans unsufferable folly and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake; for so saith our blessed Saviour, Mat. 22. 21. <hi>Render unto</hi> Caesar <hi>the things which are</hi> Caesars; there's the Debt of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice belonging to Humanity: <hi>And unto God the things that are Gods;</hi> there's the Debt of Justice belonging to Religion. <hi>Cesar</hi> must have his <hi>own,</hi> but he may not have <hi>Gods Tribute:</hi> The noblest creature that is either in Heaven or in Earth, may not have the Creators due: Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Religion is the Creators due, as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity

is the creatures, (according to <hi>Lactantius)</hi> Gods most glorious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Saints and Angels, may not be sharers with their Master in his due, that is to say in the offices of Religion, though in never so inferiour a degree, because they cannot be Gods, though in never so inferiour a degree: But they may only be sharers with their fellow-servants or creatures, in the offices of Humanity, whether double or treble, or (if you will) centuple sharers, it matters not, according to their several degrees of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and of excellency: And this was so clear a Truth in our Saviours daies, that it is said concerning the disciples of the Pharisees and the Herodians, <hi>when they heard these words they marvelled, and left him, and went their way, (v.</hi> 22.) And it is still so clear (notwithstanding the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sophistical distinctions whereby some of late have clouded it) that if any man now will needs reply against it, he must be more refractory then those Pharisees or Herodians, and fall under Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> reproof, <hi>Nay but O man, who art thou that replyest against God?</hi> Rom. 9. 20. For God the Father in his Law, God the Son in his Gospel, and God the Holy Ghost

the Pen man both of Law and Gospel, hath so determined, That the offices of Justice may not be confounded; but those which belong to Religion must be reserved by themselves for God alone; none of them all bestowed upon our neighbour; he is capable only of those offices which belong to <hi>Humanity;</hi> but of none of those which belong to <hi>Religion:</hi> Therefore your words, <q>[And the same I say proportionably, though in an infinitely inferiour degree of our Religious worship of his glorious Servants, Saints and Angels]</q> are not to be justified, though you should say them to the worlds end; For there is no proportion betwixt the creature and the Creator, and consequently you may not say the same thing, or talk of the same worship proportionably concerning them.</p>

this worship may not be with Gods Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, why should my Charity be with this worship? If it love not God, why should I love it? and if it love another instead of God, how doth it love God? Sure I am, God himself hath determined in a case very like this, That <hi>They who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a false worship, do hate the true God;</hi> Exod. 20. 5. <hi>Visiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;</hi> And how can good Christians with any conscience do that which may come under the least temptation or suspition of hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God? Wherefore this false worship must needs so trouble and startle true Believers, as to be the cause of division and dis-union for ever in the Church of Christ, dividing <hi>man from man</hi> to the worlds end, because it divides <hi>man from God;</hi> for whose sake and in whose name and love we ought to follow and embrace the Christian Communion: For the same Voice which calls us to Communion in worshipping, first calls us to Religion in the worship; nor is it possible for any man to shew a Text which saith, <hi>O come let us worship,</hi> (there's the Communion) which doth not likewise say, <hi>worship God,</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:105952:110"/>

               <p n="16">16. First that Images were long kept out of the Churches of Christians; and for this we have the testimony of <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> for the Greek, and of Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> for the Latine Church, both in one Epistle to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> which was indicted or composed by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> translated and approved by Saint <hi>Hierom.</hi> The testimony is in these words, Cùm ergo hoc vidissem in Ecclesiâ Christi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra authoritatem Scripturarum, hominis pendere Imaginem, scidi illud, &amp; magis dedi consilum custodibus ejusdem loci ut pauperem mortuum eo obvolverent &amp; efferent: Precor ut jubeas Presbyteros ejusdem loci deinceps praecipere in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siâ Christi ejusmodi vela, quae contra Religionem nostram veniunt, non appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di:

The story is this, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> going to say his prayers in a Church at <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baltha,</hi> there spied a vail or curtain which had in it the picture of Christ or of some Saint, at which he was so offended, That he cut down the said veil or curtain, and wished the Keepers of the Church to bury a dead man therewith, alledging it was against the authority of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and the purity of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that such Images should be set up in Churches; and desiring the Bishop of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> (in whose Diocess it was) to require the Clergy there to admit no more such pictures or images into that Church: Contra authoritatem Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum, contra Religionem nostram; No Christian Bishop can have stronger <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> or rather <hi>adjurations,</hi> either for the casting out or the keeping out of Images from his Church, then that the retaining or the receiving of them, is against the authority of the Scriptures, the custom of the Church, and the conscience of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; All which are here alledged by <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> For he that saith, Contra Religionem nostram, <hi>against our Religion,</hi> doth appeal to the <hi>custom</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> as well as to the <hi>conscience</hi> of <hi>Christianity:</hi>

And this quotation is such a Gordian not to your Cardinal, that after all his pains to loosen and untie it, at last <hi>Alexander</hi> like, he cuts it off, saying, Verior solutio, haec verba esse supposititia, (Bell. lib. 2. de sanct. cap. 9.) <hi>The truest answer is, The words are supposititious;</hi> But words <hi>entailed</hi> upon the Church for so many hundred years together, are not so easily <hi>cut off;</hi> The same Authority had before troubled <hi>Waldensis;</hi> yet he denies not the truth of the story, only saith, <hi>That</hi> Epiphanius <hi>did this thing in hatred of the Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites, and out of zeal not according to knowledge;</hi> (Wald. de Sacramental.

Therefore to distinguish upon an universal, is to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it a particular, to which something may be added, and that is in truth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:105952:123"/>
it to be an universal: (For every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is a kind of limitation, and every limitation is a kind of negation:) Thus, <hi>Drink ye All of this,</hi> is an universal; and therefore as we cannot add to All, so we may not distinguish upon All, and say, Omnes conficientes, <hi>All that consecrate;</hi> for that is to suppose the Universal a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, nay to make it so by adding to it; and consequently to include its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory in the same Precept, making that to say not All, instead of All; and so, <hi>Drink ye All of this,</hi> and <hi>Drink not All of this,</hi> will be the sense of one and the same Precept; which being impossible, we must look upon that <hi>Trent</hi> Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as more peremptory then true, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia declarat nullo divino praecepto Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos vel clericos non conficientes ad biben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum obligari, (Concil.

he asketh this question, <hi>Who break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the first Commandement of God, by ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence of God?</hi> (you may be sure he means the first with the second joyned to it, because he speaketh of outward irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence) to which himself thus answers, <hi>They that do not give due reverence to God and his Saints, or to their reliques and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages:</hi> An excellent Catechist, who makes the second Commandemement say, Thou shalt make, thou shalt worship graven Images; yet this man said no more then your two great Cardinals have in effect, though more covertly, said after him; only he tells us, He writes for the use of children and ignorant men, but your Cardinals write for the use of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and most learned Scholars: But as unsuccessfully as they of <hi>Nice</hi> before them; <hi>The Scripture doth not forbid us to worship Images, but to worship them as God,</hi> say the one; <hi>The Scripture doth not forbid us to worship true but false Images,</hi> say the other: Both distinguish upon Gods universal Precept, the one upon the <hi>act of worship,</hi> the other upon the <hi>object</hi> or the <hi>image worshipped;</hi> so both deny the precept to be universal, and make it particular though God made it universal,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:105952:124"/>
and by so doing, give us the <hi>contradiction</hi> of the Precept, for the <hi>exposition</hi> of it; For <hi>Thou shalt not worship an Image,</hi> is, <hi>Thou shalt worship an Image,</hi> according to both their expositions: But which is very remarkable, As they both contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict God, so they also contradict one another; That tis not easie for a sensible man to discern, how far this Image-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath been dogmatized; For, <hi>Thou shalt not worship Images as God,</hi> say they of <hi>Nice, Thou shalt worship Images as God, (if they be his images)</hi> say your men now, whereby they have in truth forsaken the <hi>Council,</hi> though they still cleave to the <hi>Images;</hi> and we have done no more, who have forsaken the Images; And indeed we have been constrained thereto out of our bounden duty to God, and his truth, not only for the many <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,</hi> which shew it to have been a <hi>facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Council,</hi> but also for the many <hi>falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> therein, which in effect shew it to have been <hi>no Council;</hi> For they bring not Scripture but Revelation and Miracle (the two principles of Enthusiasts not of Divines) for the establishment of their new doctrine; They talk of an Image of our blessed Saviour at <hi>Berytus,</hi> which

That they could not then have any entercourse either by message or letter, with those three Patriarcks, because they were wholly under the power of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razens;</hi> and that one of them, namely the Patriarck of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> was at that time dead in exile: So that if you cannot take off this forgerie and falsification from these grand voters of Images, you may not allow them the repute of a Council; and you cannot take it off from them, but you must cast it upon your own <hi>Baronius:</hi> For these are his words, An. 785. nu. 40.

no trust in his servants, that is, he trusts them not with themselves, he leaves them not to themselves; for it he did, they would soon lose themselves; according to that of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> Solus Deus immutabilis est; quae autem fecit, quia ex nihilo sunt, mutabilia sunt; <hi>God only is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, but all things that he hath made are changeable, because he hath made them out of nothing;</hi> q. d.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>And now pray Sir consider how distant are your proceedings from that love of truth, that candor of Ingenuity, that care of conscience which should be among Christian Divines, both in rejecting those interpretations of the holy Scriptures against praying to Saints (whether An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or Men) which are undoubtedly true, not only <hi>Grammatically,</hi> but also <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically</hi> and <hi>Logically,</hi> and in embracing those interpretations for praying to Saints, which are undoubtily false, if not Grammatically, yet at least both Thelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically and Logically in all these respects: And such will be found all the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Text alledged by your late Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in this argument, if they be diligently examined either according to the analogy of Religion, or according to the analogy of Reason: But I return to this, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made true in the judgement of the most eminent Divines both of Greek and Latine Church; I will name you two,

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:105952:161"/>
the Law and the Righteousness of the Law is in the power of the Agent, such an Agent may act orderly and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and yet act otherwise then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the dictate of that Law, because he is not subject to that Law, and so his abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power is not disorderly.

So that either we must say, That the Law and the righteousness of Religion is under the Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, or we must confine the Church in the exercise of Religion, to act according to the Law of God: And therefore though your wit, learning and numbers may invite you to that unsuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able insolency of seeking to domineer

But if she forsake her Religion, or corrupt her Communion, she cannot justly claim her authority, if it be denied; and doth unjustly use it, if it be granted, for she useth it against the honour and glory of Gods and for the distraction and the destruction of men; whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith expresly concerning his own, and the Authority of all the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, (for he saith <hi>our</hi> authority, which the Lord hath given <hi>us)</hi> that it was only for edification, not for destruction, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8. and having said this for the Apostles themselves, He hath much more said it for their successors: Let it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which cannot reasonably be denied, That every Christian Priest-hood or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry is the grand Apostle of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein is an Apostolical Church.

was his practice; for when by reason of his stammering he could not be admitted into the Jesuites Colledge at <hi>Granada,</hi> He fell a praying to the blessed Virgin to take away from him that impediment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing that he would never return home again, unless she granted him his request; Neque irritae sûere preces, Annuit ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescentuli votis misericordiae mater, suumque alumnum balbutie liberavit (saith his own Colledge in their praeface to his works) <hi>Nor were his prayers in vain; For the Mother of mercy hearkend to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the young man, and freed this her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pill or petitioner from his stammering:</hi> These men have now left others nothing to do but to correct the Prayers of the Holy Ghost, and of the Catholick Church, and to perswade the World not to say here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after Domine, but Domina labia mea aperies, &amp; os meum annunciabit laudem tuam, Not <hi>O Lord,</hi> but <hi>O Lady open thou my lips,</hi> and <hi>my mouth shall shew forth thy Praise.</hi>

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:105952:182"/>
(as He was before, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 16.) not that an Angel is made a God, or ought to be religiously worshipped: For though the Law was delivered by Angels, and God might send a Guardian Angel with his People, yet here God and the Angel are in effect made terms convertible, and therefore most signifie one and the same thing: If the Jews had interpreted these and the like Texts of the <hi>Angels properly so called,</hi> it had been scarce possible for so great a number of them to have turned Sadduces, and to have said <hi>There are no Angels;</hi> yet if the Christians will needs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the same Texts <hi>of the Angels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called,</hi> it will not be impossible for them to turn worse Sadduces, and to say, <hi>There is no God;</hi> for they will have no Honour, no worship left for him; being bound by these Texts so interpreted, to bestow it all upon the Angels; As the mistaken Jew had no Angel in his Faith, so the mistaken Christian may have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Angel, (that is, no God,) in his Religion; and by this means come to be the worser Sadducee: For he that will say Angels are to be religiously worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, must go for that worship to the first Table, since that only treats of the elicite
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:105952:182"/>
acts of Religion, and consequently either must leave out God, or joyn the Angels with God in all the four first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, making them Gods Copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in all Adorations, Invocations, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications, consecrating to them Liturgies, Churches, Priests, Sabbaths, and what not? and in effect say, <hi>There is no God,</hi> whiles in his Religion he saith, <hi>there are so many Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you are afraid of ungratefully slighting the Angels; why not more afraid of ungratefully slighting the God that made them, and of whose command they minister unto you? For even in this very place where it is said, <hi>Behold I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the Place which I have prepared,</hi> v. 20. it is also said, <hi>And ye shall serve the Lord your God,</hi> v. 25. You may acknowledge that God sends a Guardian Angel before you to keep you in your way, and to bring you into the Place which he hath prepared for your Soul, even to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bosome; yet you may not worship or invocate that Angel; for it is said expresly, <hi>ye shall serve the Lord your God;</hi> and surely Invocation is the highest act of Religious service.

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:105952:184"/>
great excellency that you should ascribe to him those things which belong to God: Till you can say of him that he hath opened the eyes of your body to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Light of nature, how can you say to him, Open the eyes of my Soul to rereive the light of Grace?

                  <hi>Lord Jesus receive my Spirit,</hi> when it is to be carried to him by the Angels, for they minister to this Lord; But you cannot say, Lord Jesus receive my Prayers, when they are given or offered to his Angels, for they are not fellow-sharers in his Lordship: And this instance alone is enough to answer all your objections which you have gathered out of my eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations; but if not, you may take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; The Psalmist saith, <hi>The Angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them,</hi> yet he saith not, <hi>O Taste</hi> and see how gracious the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord is, But <hi>O Tast and see how gracious the Lord is, blessed is the man that trusteth in him,</hi> Ps. 34. 7, 8.

in such prayers as will not give my Soul the Antipast of eternity, that is in such prayers as do not bid me say unto my self, <hi>O Taste and see how gracious the Lord is,</hi> because they do not ascend up so high as the Lord: For prayer being a spiritual colloquy with him to whom we pray, why should I pray to an Angel, which probably may not be present to partake of this colloquy, and indeed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not partake of it, if it be meerly spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual (that is only in the heart) or if he could, why should my heart leave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with God, to converse with his Servant?

the <hi>one</hi> as well as for the <hi>other:</hi> If we may (as you infer) humbly pray them to do those good offices for us, which God hath appointed them, we may also humbly pray God, to give us leave to sin against Him in our Prayers; for to break his Commandement is to sin against Him, and he hath expresly commanded, saying, <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble,</hi> Psal. 50. 15. In that he hath said <hi>Call upon me,</hi> he hath also in effect said, Call not upon any of my Angels, for that is not to call upon me; Therefore dare I not pray to Angels, for fear of bringing <hi>Judas</hi> his curse upon my prayers, of whom it was said, <hi>Let his prayer be turned into sin,</hi> Ps. 109. v. 7.

James <hi>and St.</hi> Paul <hi>deliver one and the same doctrine concerning Justification,</hi> [That tis by Faith in Chtist, not by works] <hi>but St.</hi> Paul <hi>speaks of Faith more in relation to Christ,</hi> its proper Object, <hi>to teach the Jews</hi> the necessity of Faith, <hi>St.</hi> James <hi>speaks of Faith more in relation to works,</hi> its proper effect, <hi>to teach unsanctified Christians</hi> the obedience of Faith. 13. <hi>The doctrine of</hi> Justification by Faith without works, <hi>is the whole scope both of the Law and of the Gospel, as is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly proved in the Epistle to the</hi> Hebrews. 14. <hi>Good worke are</hi> necessary consequents <hi>of the Faith that justifieth, not</hi> Causes <hi>of the</hi> Justification, <hi>and are no further requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us by any of the Apostles or Prophets, in the judgement of St.</hi> Austin, <hi>St.</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, <hi>and St.</hi> Chrysostom; <hi>Therefore</hi> Justification by Faith without works, <hi>was then the judgement of the Catholick Church, and indeed is now of the present Roman Church, if we look upon her</hi> Devotions, <hi>not her</hi> Disputes. 15. <hi>To maintain</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by mans righteousness, <hi>is not only to</hi> forsake <hi>Christs Church, but also to</hi> destroy it. 16. <hi>Christs imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, blasphemously called a</hi> Fiction <hi>by</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin, <hi>piously acknowledged a</hi> Reality

This gave occasion to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> and St. <hi>Jude,</hi> (who all writ
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:105952:196"/>
after St. <hi>Paul,)</hi> to direct their stiles chiefly against such vain boasters of this empty Faith, and their Epistles were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwatds peculiarly called <hi>Catholick,</hi> for this reason amongst others, That they were all written in Vindication of the true Catholick Faith, which did teach a man so to believe in Christ as to have his life answerable to his belief.

To testifie the doctrine of the Gospel concerning the Grace of God in Christ, to be the onely doctrine to bring you to eternal Salvation. 2. To Perswade you to stand fast and persevere in that doctrine, by leading your lives answerable to your profession. And this account may we give concerning the rest of the Authors of the Catholick Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; for thus the whole Argument of St. <hi>Johns</hi> first Epistle consists of those two principal parts of the Christian Religion, The <hi>Promises,</hi> and the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Gospel; For to the <hi>Promises</hi> we must
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:105952:196"/>
refer all that he speaks of Communion with God, of the expiation of our sins by the blood of Christ, and of the hope of eternal life. To the <hi>Precepts</hi> we must refer all that he speaks of true Faith in Christ, of living <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>righteously</hi> according to that Faith, and of loving God sincerely, or not loving the world, that we may live <hi>godly,</hi> and of loving our Bretheren sincerely not hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, That we may live <hi>righteously:</hi> The like may we say for St. <hi>James,</hi> and St. <hi>Jude,</hi> that their Epistles are chiefly against the <hi>Solifidean Hereticks,</hi> and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore filled with divers exhortations to several Christian Virtues which they had <hi>deserted,</hi> and with Dehortations from the the contrary vices, which they had <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi> And we may be Catholicks in this doctrine of Justification, according to these Catholick Epistles, and yet still deny Justification by works; For it is only the Faith in Christ that is justified by its works, but the man is still justified only by his Faith.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You are as zealous <hi>for</hi> Justification by works, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> is <hi>against it;</hi> with what good Conscience I cannot say; but sure upon no good ground; yet you

have appealed to St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, as the Judge of this controversie, to decide on your side; and accordingly to St. <hi>Paul</hi> you shall go, who sure will very little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend you by his decision: For I pray what works can any man do which are not comprised under <hi>The works of the Law?</hi> But it is St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s most absolute Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <hi>Therefore by the deeds or works of the Law, there shall no flesh be justified,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. He that looks upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going words setting forth the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sins that were in the best of men then living, the Jews, and in those times wherein they lived best, even the times of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> (for all the proofs here concerning their wickedness are taken out of the <hi>Psalms</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of <hi>Isaiah)</hi> will easily acknowledge that the words though <hi>particular</hi> in their <hi>occasion,</hi> yet are <hi>universal</hi> in their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> and do set forth the general corruption of all men whatsoever, whereby they are most grievous trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours of the Law, and most odious in the sight, most obnoxious to the Justice of God for their transgressions. This considered, He must be led by the spirit of errour, who will not see the <hi>evidence;</hi>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:105952:197"/>
and by the spirit of contradiction, who will gainsay the <hi>power</hi> of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, <hi>Therefore by the works of the Law there shal no flesh be justified:</hi> for it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon these Premises, No Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour of the Law can be justified by the works of the Law; But all men whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are transgressours of the Law; Therefore no man whatsoever can be justified by the works of the Law; which is as much as to say, That no man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever can be justified by works; for all works whatsoever are reducible to the works of the Law, as being done through obedience to its authority; and not rightly done, but through compliance <hi>with,</hi> and conformity <hi>to</hi> its righteousness.</p>
               <p>And to this Argument he adds an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, <hi>v.</hi> 27. which may be put into this Syllogism.</p>
               <p>The Law of works doth not wholly exclude mans boasting in his Justification.</p>
               <p>But, God will have mans boasting wholly excluded in his Justification. Therefore, The Law of works doth not justifie.</p>
               <p>The Major is further proved by <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath wherof to glory.</hi> The Minor

by <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8, 9. <hi>For by Grace ye are saved through Faith, not of works, lest any man should boast;</hi> what remains then for the conclusion, but that the Law of works doth not justify? For if it justified not <hi>Abraham,</hi> who had so good works, as to be called <hi>the friend of God,</hi> much less will it justify me, who by my wicked deeds am become Gods enemy. We have yet a third argument in this very place, <hi>v.</hi> 29, &amp; 30. which concludes thus, If Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation were by the works of the Law, then onely the Jews, who alone had the Law written in tables, could be justified, and God should regard the salvation of no other people save of the Jews: But these consequents are directly against the goodness of God, and the whole scope or Tenor of his Word; Therefore so is that Antecedent, that Justification is by works of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e Law. These are St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s three arguments in this place for his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative conclusion, which is <hi>against Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by works.</hi> And he is not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this, but he gives us also an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative conclusion, which is <hi>for Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith.</hi> v. 24. <hi>Being justified free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ,</hi> which he fully explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

and confirmeth from all the causes of our Justification.

The formal cause (for Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation being an action, and therefore an accident, cannot properly have a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial cause, though you by your inherent righteousness do a little intrench upon this Rule of Logick) I say the formal
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:105952:199"/>
cause of Justification is expressed, <hi>v.</hi> 25. to wit, <hi>The remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God;</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding sins <hi>present</hi> and <hi>to come,</hi> as if they were not also remitted, but onely name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sins <hi>past,</hi> that we might not think Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification doth give us a liberty of future sininng. The formal cause then of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is the remission of sins: For God doth so far justify us, or accept and account us for just and righteous, as far as he doth pardon our sins, and absolve and acquit us from condemnation for Christs righteousness. Thus it was <hi>God be merciful to me a sinner,</hi> which made the Publican go away justified, St. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13, 14. not his own merit, but Gods mercy.

               <p>These Logical absurdities (besides others that are Theological) cannot well be avoided by those who make inherent righteousness the formal cause of our Justification; And therefore though we separate not inherent and imputative righteousness, (which your insolent Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matist blasphemously calls <hi>Putative,</hi> as if it were meerly <hi>fict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>tious,</hi> when as in truth all our righteousness is <hi>so</hi> in respect of it) I say, though we separate not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent and imputative righteousness from one another, in the man that is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, (for true Faith alwaies worketh obedience, and God will not, cannot justifie the disobedient) yet we must se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from one another in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Justification; For 'tis only the <hi>Imputative</hi> righteousness which we have from our Saviour, not the <hi>Inherent</hi> righteousness which we have in our selves, which can acquit us at God's Judgement seat, or absolve us as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and consequently which may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the formal cause of our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the final cause of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:105952:202"/>
is set down, first explicitly, that it is the declaration of Gods Righteousness, <hi>vers.</hi> 25, <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. <hi>[To declare his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness]</hi> not onely that this way of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a sinner, is according to Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, both in words and Types in all the Old Testament, but also that this promise was according to the rule of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, because it acquitteth not a sinner without a due satisfaction for his sin, nor without a true and serious aversion from himself, and conversion to his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: Secondly, the final cause of our justification is set down implicitly, That it is our glorying or boasting in God alone; For whereas <hi>v.</hi> 27. he excludeth all other boasting, tis necessary he must include this, as himself saith more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30, 31. <hi>Christ Jesus is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and redemption.</hi> There is our Justification set forth <hi>in it self,</hi> in <hi>its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents,</hi> and in <hi>its consequents;</hi> In <hi>it self; for Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>st Jesus</hi> is our righteousness to deliver us from the guilt of sin, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting and discharging us. <hi>In its ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents,</hi> for he is our wisdom, to free us from the blindness and darkness of sin, by enlighting and instructing us. <hi>In</hi>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:105952:202"/>
                  <hi>its consequents;</hi> for he is our Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this life, to free us from the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sin, by renewing and cleansing us: and our Redemption in the life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, to free us from the miseries of sin, by receiving and by glorifying us; <hi>That according as it is written, he that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, let him glory in the Lord;</hi> There is the final cause of our Justification. Christ Jesus doth therefore instruct us by his most holy Word, justifie us by his allsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient merit, sanctifie us by his most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, glorifie us by his all saving Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that we may not glory in our selves, but onely in our Saviour, from whom we have both the <hi>Knowledg,</hi> and the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase,</hi> and the <hi>Procurement,</hi> and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment</hi> of our salvation.</p>
               <p>The Apostle having thus severally proved, first his negative conclusion which is <hi>against justification by works,</hi> and after that his affirmative conclusion which is for <hi>justification by Faith,</hi> he at length joyns them both together in one Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical determination, <hi>Therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that a man is justified by Faith w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deeds of the Law,</hi> v. 28. And this conclusion he again repeateth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Knowing that a man is not justified by the</hi>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:105952:203"/>
                  <hi>works of the Law, but by the Faith of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ;</hi> which he immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms with no less then Ten several argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the next Chapter, all alledged to confute their foolishness in falling from Christ to the Law, from Faith to works in the doctrine of Justification; And being alledged by the Apostle to confute their <hi>foolishness,</hi> they will either the more easily prevent, or the more acceptably reform and redress <hi>Ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first Argument is this; You have received the gift of the Holy Spirit, not by the works of the Law, but by the hearing of Faith, <hi>v.</hi> 2. but the gift of the Holy Spirit is the best pledge of your Justification or Reconciliation with God, (for he giveth not his Spirit to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) Therefore you are justified not by the Law, but by the Gospel, or by the Hearing of Faith.</p>
               <p>The second Argument is this: The same way that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified, who is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ather of the faithful, and to whom the Promise was made, The same way must you be justified; But He was justified onely by Faith: <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>The Third this: As many as are of the works of the Law, are under the curse,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:105952:203"/>
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 10. but none that are under the curse, are justified.</p>
               <p>The fourth this, The just shall live by Faith; but the Law is not of Faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. 12. that is, The just obtaineth life and salvation by the free grace of God apprehended by Faith in Christ; but the Law alloweth no such free grace; for that promiseth life only upon the (now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible) condition of perfect obedience; <hi>The man that doth them, shall live in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth this, Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. Therefore the Law could not justifie us, for it did curse us; and if it could, in vaine was Christ made a curse for us; in vaine did he do and suffer so much for our Redemption.</p>
               <p>The sixth this, To whom the Promises were made, to him they were perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the Promises of spiritual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings (and consequently of justification) were made to <hi>Abrahams seed,</hi> not seeds, that is to Christ and his members; not to them that should be under the Law, but only to them that should be in Christ.</p>
               <p>The seventh is this, The Promise of
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:105952:204"/>
spiritual blessednesse was made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> long before the giving of the Law; therefore neither to be <hi>accomplished</hi> from the observation, nor to be <hi>abolished</hi> by the obligation of the Law, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. which is further argued, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>If the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be of the Law, 'tis no more of Promise; but God gave it to Abraham by Promise;</hi> therefore 'tis not of the Law.</p>
               <p>The eighth this, That which was a sign of enmitie, cannot be a means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; but the Law was a sign of enmitie betwixt God and man, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in that it was ordained by Angels, not immediately by God himself, who being offended had withdrawn his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which shews that men were at a distance <hi>from,</hi> and at enmitie <hi>with</hi> God; <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. Therefore the Law cannot be the means of our accesse <hi>to,</hi> or of our reconciliation <hi>with</hi> God.</p>
               <p>The ninth is this, The Law cannot give life to any man by exempting him from the punishment of sin, nor give righteousnesse by exempting him from the guilt of sin. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. 22. Therefore both righteousnesse and life are given only by Faith in Christ.</p>
               <p>The tenth and last argument is this,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:105952:204"/>
The office of the Law was to be our School-master to bring us unto Christ, to shew us the <hi>imperfection</hi> of our own, and to make us desire the <hi>imputation</hi> of his righteousnesse, that we might be justified by Faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. but the Law cannot go beyond its own office; therefore no man can be justified either in whole or in part by the works of the Law.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Thus have I mustred up S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to batter down <hi>our own,</hi> but to keep up <hi>our Saviours</hi> righteousness in the doctrine of Justification, which being a doctrine that came down from Heaven, is best maintained by arguments from Heaven; For as humane reason could not teach it, so humane reason cannot so well defend it; and doth so much the worse oppose it; nor do I see how these arguments can be answered, unlesse they can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed; nor how they can be denyed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ince they are so exactly agreeable with the Analogy of the text, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not disagree from the Analogy of Faith. Many arguments have been used by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Divines drawn out of several places of the holy Scriptures, which have been agreeable with the Analogy of Faith, though not with the Analogy of
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:105952:205"/>
the text, and they have passed for good Theological arguments, because they have been agreeable only with the Analogy of Faith; how much rather should those arguments be taken for Theological, which are agreeable not only with the <hi>Analogy of faith</hi> in the doctrine they prove, but also with the <hi>Analogy of the Text</hi> in the manner of their proof? And surely if all Divines did more use this way of arguing, they would have much lesse of <hi>Contention,</hi> and much more of <hi>Conscience</hi> in their arguments: you have here shewed me this good way, and I was very glad to see it, and as willing to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; for in all this Paragraph you have quoted nothing but Scripture; all the fault is, you have made unwarrantable inferences from your quotations.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For first you say, <hi>Here are works requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to justifie as well as Faith, because St.</hi> Paul <hi>saith, we wait for righteousnesse by Faith which worketh by love,</hi> Gal. 5. 5, 6. He saith, the Faith by which we are justified is a Faith working by love; you thence inferre, that we are justified by our works as well as by our Faith: you may as well say, because our eyes wherewith we see, are in our heads; we see with or by our
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:105952:205"/>
heads, as well as with or by our eyes: or because our hands wherewith we handle are joyned to our armes, we handle with our armes as well as with our hands; for as the eye that is out of the head seeth not, and as the hand that is parted from the arme handleth not; so Faith that is without works justifieth not; yet have works no more to do in justifying than the head hath in seeing, or the arme hath in handling.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Again you say, <hi>Charity is greater than faith, and must therefore needs have the greater influence in our justification.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see the reason of this consequence, no more than of that; a lyon is greater than a Hare, therefore he must needs run faster. If the Apostle had spoken of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and had said Charity was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Faith, your consequent would have been good; but speaking not at all of justification, your consequence cannot be good concerning that, but must be made good concerning somewhat else, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning those other things whereof he speaketh, as particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those admirable acts of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>not envying, not vaunting, bearing all things, beleeving all things, hoping all</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:105952:206"/>
                  <hi>things, enduring all things,</hi> to which the soul is disposed by Faith, but in which it is confirmed and perfected by charity: or concerning the everlasting duration and continuance of Charity; for that shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail, but shall go with us into heaven, and abide there with us for ever, because that very motion of the soul in the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of God wherein consisteth eternal blessednesse, is an act of Charity. But Faith being of things <hi>not seen,</hi> must needs vanish when we come to see God face to face, by a clear vision; and Hope being of things <hi>not enjoyed,</hi> must needs vanish when we come to enjoy him by a full and immediate comprehension; only Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which in this life outpasseth Faith and Hope by more immediately uniting the soul to God, shall in the next life out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe it selfe, when it shall taste the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable sweetnesse, and enjoy the immortal comforts, and feel the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible delights and joyes of that union. In these respects which are named, 'tis most true that Charity is greater than Faith, but not in respect of justification, which is not named, unlesse you will say the Apostle put more in the Conclusion than in the Premises: nay,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:105952:206"/>
though it should be granted, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth not here speak comparatively but positively, or else <hi>that Charity is greater than Faith,</hi> yet will it not follow, that Faith may not be greater than Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in some one respect, as particularly in this of justification; for though Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be the more <hi>noble</hi> in it selfe, yet Faith is the more <hi>needful</hi> for us: Charity may have the <hi>absolute</hi> preeminence in regard of <hi>its excellency,</hi> and yet Faith may have a <hi>comparative</hi> preeminence in regard of <hi>its use.</hi> Charitie may be the greater in regard of <hi>innocent men,</hi> who can sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly and comfortably see God as he is in himselfe; but Faith must be the greater in regard of <hi>sinful men,</hi> who cannot see God as he is <hi>in himself,</hi> either <hi>stedfastly</hi> because of their weaknesse, or <hi>comfortably</hi> because of their sinfulnesse; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must look on him as he is <hi>in his Son,</hi> who took upon him our weaknesse to give us his strength, and our sin to give us his righteousnesse: so far is it from a true consequence, <q>Charitie is greater than Faith, &amp; must needs therefore have the greater influence in our justification.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. You have yet one more Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to prove justification by works, and
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:105952:207"/>
that is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Not the hearers of the law, [there is Faith,] are just before God, but the doers of the law [there are good works] shall be justified;</hi> here I cannot question your <hi>inference</hi> which you do not make, but I must question your <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> which you have made. For this place only sheweth that both Jewes and Gentiles might justly be condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause both had sinned against the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which God had given them of his law; but it doth not shew how either might be justified: yet you have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted it of Justification and by your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation have laid <hi>a kind of slurre</hi> and reproach upon Faith, saying, <hi>Not the hearers of the law, [there is Faith]</hi> as if Faith were placed in the ear, busied only in the hearing of the law, not considering that Faith is the gift of God, (the most precious gift that ever he gave to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man, excepting his Son, <hi>in</hi> and <hi>for</hi> whom he gives it) and that the gifts of God are to be received with our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, unlesse we would have them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called and reversed with his repentance; for since we cannot deserve them, if we will not highly prize them, we shew our selves <hi>unworthy</hi> of what we have, and
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:105952:207"/>
make our selves <hi>uncapable</hi> of having more: Come sir I will speak plainly, that I may speak honourably of so great a gift. <hi>If Faith be not in our hearts,</hi> Christ is not there, <hi>(for he dwelleth in the heart by Faith,</hi> Ephes. 3. 17.) and if Christ be not in our hearts, we can neither have good words in our mouths, nor good works in our hands; for out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the heart as the tongue speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, so also the hand acteth; therefore pray lets have no more of this Divinitie, <hi>[not the hearers of the law, there is Faith]</hi> for what can any sacrilegious Enthusiast say more, who robs God of mens hearts in regular and sound prayers, to place all Religion in the ear? sure there were many hearers of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Sermon, for it was preached on the Sabbath, and in a place where prayer was wont to be made, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 13. who heard more than the law, (for they also heard the Gospel) yet only one <hi>Lydia</hi> (for ought we know) was judged <hi>faithful unto the Lord;</hi> and the text gives this reason of her Faith, <hi>whose heart the Lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of</hi> Paul: Therefore the hearers of the law have not Faith, but the doers of it, (at least in
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:105952:208"/>
vote and desire, <hi>i. e.</hi> those who labour to do it,) yet they when they have done all are taught to say, <hi>we are unprofitable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, we have done that which was our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do,</hi> Luk. 17. 10. Their doings can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fully reach the obligation of their duty, and how can they be a satisfaction for their undutifulnesse? All their works of righteousnesse, when they have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to do all those things which are commanded, and as they are commanded them, will leave them <hi>unprofitable;</hi> and much more must their works of unrighteousnesse make them <hi>unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> so that you have only supposed a false Faith in the hearers of the Law, not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd Justification by Faith in the doers of it; for he that saith, <hi>not the hearers of the Law are just before God, but the doers of the Law shall be justified,</hi> doth not thereby <hi>suppose</hi> (much less <hi>averre,)</hi> any men to be so compleat doers of the Law, as to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their good deeds for their justification.</p>
               <p n="12">12. You might happily better have appealed to St. <hi>James,</hi> than to St. <hi>Paul</hi> for justification by works; and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he have befriended this your appeal, much lesse have justified that your position: for St. <hi>James</hi> doth not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:105952:208"/>
the doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but doth only correct those who had <hi>misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,</hi> or at least <hi>misapplied</hi> it; bidding them <hi>add to their Faith Vertue,</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> had <hi>done before,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 5.) or not expect to be justified by it: wherefore those two Apostles may very well be said to have delivered but one and the same doctrine concerning justification, if we take their words not as we please, but as they intended them: for St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing against proud Justitiaries among the Jews, who sought for righteousness from their own works according to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and rejected the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of God by <hi>Faith in Christ,</hi> strongly denyed Justification by works, meaning works properly so called, that is to say, a perfect and perpetual observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole Law, because all men whatsoever (Christ only excepted,) had many wayes transgressed the Law: But St. <hi>James</hi> writing against licentious and profane Hypocrites among the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who pretending to Faith in Christ, lived not according to the Rule of the Christian Faith, but altogether neglected the study and practice of good works, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Justification by works, meaning by
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:105952:209"/>
works the very obedience of Faith, or a working by love and obedience: The one writ against the <hi>proud opposers,</hi> the other against the <hi>fond Pretenders</hi> of Faith in Christ; therefore the one tells the proud Jews that their works were not answerable to the Law in which they trusted, that he might teach them the <hi>necessity</hi> of Faith in Christ: The other tell the hypocritical Christians, that their works were not answerable to the Gospel of which they boasted, that he might teach them the <hi>obedience</hi> of that Faith; accordingly as often as St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, (in sense at least, if not in words,) <hi>That we are justified only by Faith,</hi> so often he understandeth a Faith working by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. or an unfained unhypocritical Faith, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, such a Faith as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to hypocrites, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. And as often as St. <hi>James</hi> denieth <hi>that we are justified only by Faith,</hi> so often he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth a Faith not working by love, a Faith only in profession or in perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, not in obedience or in affection; a Faith belonging to hypocrities, not to good Christians, a Faith in <hi>noise</hi> and in <hi>word,</hi> but not in <hi>truth</hi> and in <hi>deed:</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares from the manner of his expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                  <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>If a man say he hath Faith;</hi> for the Apostle would not say it for him, because he had only a dead Faith; <hi>A Faith without works,</hi> and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life <hi>(operari sequitur esse)</hi> the Faith of devils, from the evidence or power of truth convincing the understanding; not the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Rahab,</hi> from the acceptance and love of truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the will; therefore these two positions are not contrary, <hi>A man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified before God, not by the works of the Law,</hi> (which he cannot have,) <hi>but only by Faith in Christ,</hi> (which alwaies work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love;) and <hi>A man is justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, not only by Faith,</hi> (that is an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical knowledge of the Gospel, and an emptie profession of Faith,) <hi>but also by works,</hi> that is an affectionate love of the Gospel, and a sincere obedience of Faith; The former position is maintained by St. <hi>Paul</hi> against those Jews who rejected the Gospel of Christ: the latter position is maintained by St. <hi>James</hi> against those Christians who profaned the same Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: Both Apostles teach one and the same Justification by Faith in Christ; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of Faith more in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>its proper object,</hi> (even to Christ)
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:105952:210"/>

Their sacrifices did expiate sin only by vertue of this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; And this is that which the same Apostle proves to the Jews in his Epistle which he peculiarly sent to them, the sum whereof is briefly this, That Jesus Christ (whom he did preach to them in that Epistle,) being the eternal Sonne of God, coessential and coequal with his Father, perfect God and perfect man in one and the same person, was that Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah which God from the beginning of time had promised, and in the fulnesse of time had sent into the world, as the only King to Govern, as the only Priest to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile, as the only Prophet to instruct his Church, according to the Covenant made before the Law; to the types and figures given under the Law; and all the predictions, explications, additions and confirmations by the Prophets: so that unlesse they would reject all the docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given to them in their own Law, and by their own Prophets throughout all the Old Testament, they must thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge, heartily embrace, and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:105952:211"/>
dutifully obey Jesus Christ as the sole Author of their redemption and salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or (to speak yet neerer to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, though not to Gods Truth,) as the sole author of Justification, to redeem them from the <hi>guilt;</hi> and of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to redeem them from the <hi>bondage</hi> of their sins: This is the Doctrine of the whole Epistle to the Hebrews, which is briefly delivered in the first words, and confirmed and enlarged in the sequele of that Epistle; <hi>God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son;</hi> There's our blessed Saviour as Prophet to instruct the Church. <hi>Whom he appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</hi> There he is as King to govern the Church, which is his <hi>inheritance</hi> as man, his <hi>workmanship</hi> as God. <hi>When he had by himself purged our sins;</hi> There he is as Priest to offer himself for a Sacrifice to reconcile the Church; And all the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle after this, (in the doctrinal part of it) is nothing else but an enlargement upon these Three Heads, shewing the necessity of Christs three Offices and the excellency of his Person according to

each Office; <hi>viz.</hi> according to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office in the first and second; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Prophetical Office in the third and fourth Chapters; and according to his Priestly Office in the rest, till the nineteenth Verse of the tenth Chapter; After which He treateth of those Offices and Duties which belong to Christians, and that in the same method or manner as he had before of the Offices belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Christ, first briefly <hi>summing</hi> them up together, and then fully and largely <hi>explaining</hi> them; For so <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 22.

To the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like exercise of all those duties of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which God had appointed for the nourishment and the increase of Faith, Hope, and Charity; and the rest of the Epistle afterwards is but an enlargement upon these. Will you say because he speaks so much for good works in the latter part of his Epistle, He therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them to Justification, as well as Faith? Look on the tenth Chapter, you will soon recall that saying; For there it is proved, That the Law Sacrifices could
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:105952:212"/>
not take away sin, (that is, could not justifie those who offered them,) by two irresistible Topicks, <hi>ab absurdo, ab impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibili.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, From the command of the Law enjoyning those Sacrifices to be repeated every year, which had been needless (and therefore absurd) if the worshippers could have been purged by them, so as to have had no more Conscience of sin, <hi>vers.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From the nature of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices that were offered, which were not of so great an efficacy as to <hi>purge</hi> sin, much less of so great an excellency as to <hi>expiate</hi> it; <hi>For it is not possible that the blood of Bulls and of Goats should take away sins;</hi> v. 4. And surely he that makes it his work to shew the weakness of <hi>the Law-Sacrifices</hi> to take away sin, could not make it his intent to set up <hi>the Gospel-Sacrifices,</hi> (whether of the Heart by Meditation, or the Lips by Prayer, or of the Hand by Alms-deeds) as expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for our sins: For the same Objections still hold against the <hi>one,</hi> which were made against the <hi>other.</hi> The necessity of their repetion is as great; the proof of their imperfection is far greater; I ask the

soul of the most religious Votary that now lives, whether he dare say, that he ever prayed so devoutly, but that either for want of firmness in his attention, or of zeal in his affection, he needed to ask forgiveness for his Prayers. There was nothing of sin in the worst of <hi>Legal;</hi> there is something of sin in the best of <hi>Evangelical</hi> Sacrifices; and how then can it make an atonement for another sin? 14. Therefore what ever be the <hi>excellency</hi> of good works as to Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, or the <hi>efficacy</hi> of them as to mans salvation; yet they cannot be so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent as to <hi>deserve,</hi> nor so efficacious as to <hi>procure</hi> the Justification of a sinner; <hi>no, it cost more to redeem a soul, so that He</hi> (even the most righteous man that is) <hi>must let that alone for ever.</hi> Non dabit Deo placationem suam, &amp; pretium redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis animae suae; He can give to God what may please his goodness, not what may appease his anger, or satisfie his Justice; He can offer up the <hi>homage,</hi> he cannot offer up the <hi>price</hi> of his soul; Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we are bound to interpret all these and the like Texts <hi>concerning good works,</hi> as declaring their <hi>indispensable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,</hi> not as declaring their <hi>meritorious</hi>

                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:105952:223"/>
and St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> but what the present Roman Church doth believe and profess at this very day; for that still teaching all her Communicants to pray on this wise, Effunde super nos misericordiam tuam, ut dimittas quae conscientia metu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, &amp; adjicias quod oratio non praesumit, per dominum nostrum; <hi>Pour down upon us the abundance of thy mercy, forgiveing us those things whereof our Conscience is afraid, and giving unto us that that our Prayers dare not presume to ask, through Jesus Christ our Lord,</hi> 12.

God hath made Remission of sins an Article of our Faith, not a duty of our life, and his Church accounteth them Infidels who do not believe it.

Let us then change the daily Hymne of the Church and say, <hi>When we had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the wickednesse of life, we did open the Kingdom of Heaven to our selves that were workers;</hi> not, <hi>when Thou hadst overcome the sharpnesse of death, Thou didst open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers:</hi> The Church owns the opening of Heaven to Christs death, not denying true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to be <hi>workers,</hi> but denying Heaven to be opened by their <hi>works:</hi> And shall we say that Heaven is <hi>opened</hi> by <hi>our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> merits, but <hi>entred</hi> by our <hi>own?</hi> 15. But see first if by saying so, we do not only <hi>forsake</hi> Christs Church but also <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy</hi> it; For none can shut the gates of Hell, but He that hath opened the gate of Heaven; The same righteousness shuts <hi>Them</hi> (for they are many and wide) and opens <hi>This,</hi> (for it is but one and very narrow) If mans righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse can do so, let not <hi>Hierusalem</hi> be any longer called by this name, <hi>The Lord our righteousnesse,</hi> Jer. 23. 16.

(3. <hi>par. q.</hi> 41. <hi>art.</hi> 1. <hi>c.) The whole Church which is the mystical body of Christ, is computed but as one person with its Head which is Christ; Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful and all his children are <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one and the same mystical body;</hi> therefore they have all but one and the same righteousnesse whereby to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified; And Christ is the <hi>Head of that mysticall body;</hi> therefore they all have His righteousness imputed to them for their Justification; To set up another righteousness for this, is to set up another Head; and to set up another Head, is to destroy the Body; The righteousnesse of the Head is communicated and may be imputed to all the members of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, because <hi>Head and Body</hi> make but one Person; But the righteousnesse of one member is not communicable, and may not be imputed to another member, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all the members make several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; forasmuch as the Body whereof they are members is not <hi>natural,</hi> but <hi>mystical;</hi> so we have (in the judgment of <hi>Aquinas)</hi> great reason to believe <hi>the imputed righteousnesse of Christ;</hi> but none at all to believe <hi>the imputed righteousnesse of the Saints:</hi> For the Head hath, but

               <p>First, In regard of the <hi>imputation;</hi> for
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:105952:227"/>
it is againg the nature of Justice, that one mans righteousness should be imputed for the satisfaction of another mans unrighteousnesse, without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that is to be satisfied; but God hath nowhere declared, much less promised his consent to receive such satisfaction; So that the imputing one mans righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to another, must needs be <hi>vain,</hi> because God may be thought not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it; nay more, it must needs be <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> because man may be thought to <hi>prescribe,</hi> (if not to <hi>extort)</hi> Gods accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; And if there be <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>sin</hi> in the imputation, we must say there is <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in</hi> it; for having its very being in Vanity and sin, it cannot have a <hi>real</hi> but a meer <hi>imaginary</hi> or fictitious being.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This imputed righteousness of men is a meer fiction in regard of the <hi>righteousnesse</hi> it self: For it supposeth the righteousness of the creature to make condigne satisfaction to the Justice of the Creator, which is impossible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the one is <hi>finite,</hi> the other is <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;</hi> Nay yet farther to heighthen this impossibility (at least in our conception, though not in truth) it supposeth the righteousness of the creature, not only
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:105952:228"/>
to satisfie for its <hi>own,</hi> but also for <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others</hi> unrighteousnes; whereas it is the opinion of some of the best Scholemen, even of <hi>Bernard, Scotus,</hi> and <hi>Gabriel,</hi> (if we may believe <hi>Vasques)</hi> That no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can have a righteousnesse adequate, or exactly proportionable to the Justice of the Creator, (for it self, much less for another,) from <hi>its own worthinesse;</hi> but only from <hi>Gods acceptance;</hi> And that Christ himself, <hi>as man,</hi> could not have merited forgivenesse of our sins at the hands of God, as having satisfied his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Justice, if God had not been mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully pleased of his own free grace and goodnesse, to accept of his satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Nullius creaturae neque adeò Christi apud Deum esse meritum &amp; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactionem simpliciter condignam, sed ex acceptatione ipsius Dei, qui sponte suâ eâ satisfactione &amp; merito <hi>vol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

it to <hi>think,</hi> what an unwarrantable ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is it <hi>to say,</hi> that one mans righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness can be meritorious to make another righteous which hath no condignity, to challenge acceptance for it self, and much less hath any compact or covenant to be accepted for another? And if it be not meritorious to exempt him from guilt, how can it be <hi>satisfactory</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt him from punishment?

Because the Passions of Christ, though they were all infinite in value from the dignity of the sufferer; yet were none of them superfluous for the cause and ground of his suffering. 2. Because there it is not the same reason of merit in the Saints as was in Christ; For even those actions of Christ which proceeded from his humane nature, had their merit from his Divine nature; as the flesh of Christ is said to give life, the obedience of Christ to give righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the blood of Christ to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed the Church, not <hi>in it self,</hi> but as the flesh, and the obedience, and the blood of the Son of God; <hi>The Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood,</hi> Acts 20. 28.

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:105952:229"/>
they proceeded from the spirit of God, yet were they the doings and sufferings only of men, not of God; because the Spirit of God dwelled in them, not by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Union, but only by a powerful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. 3. Because there is not the same reason of the acceptance of the Saints merits as of Christs; For Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of accepting the sufferings of his Son for the expiation of our sins is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; not so of accepting the sufferings of his servants, were they more then enough for themselves; There is not in all the written word the least contract or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Gods making <hi>That he would accept superfluous merits, or sufferings, or satisfaction from some, when for defects and demerits and dissatisfaction from others:</hi> Besides what a strange insolency is it for a Divine to deny to Christian souls the Imputation of that part of Christs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, which is <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> both for Gods satisfaction, and for their own salvation; and at the same time to avow the imputation of that Part of Christs sufferings which he professeth to be <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous?</hi> For if <hi>necessary</hi> sufferings or doings may not, how should <hi>unnecessary</hi> be imputed? But above all it is a most

abominable insolency to deny the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Christs righteousnesse, which is both <hi>substantial</hi> and <hi>satisfactory,</hi> and to allow the imputation of the Saints righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, which is not <hi>substantial</hi> (as to its supposed superfluity,) and cannot be <hi>satisfactory</hi> if it could be <hi>superfluous;</hi> tis not sufficient to justifie them that have it, much less them that have it not; The blessed Virgin her self did say, <hi>My soul doth magnifie the Lord, and my Spirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour:</hi> Ascribing to <hi>her God,</hi> not to <hi>her self,</hi> the honour of her salvation; Therefore though she had a vast stock of oile in her Vessel for her own lamp, yet I fear if any foolish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, which had not so, should say unto her, <hi>Give me of your oyl, for my lamp is gone out,</hi> she would turn the parable into a history and say, <hi>not so, lest there be not enough for me and for you;</hi> Matth. 25. 9. This answer the Text in effect gives for her as for the wisest of all Virgins; and therefore 'tis most probable she would give it for her self; and if so, (To let pass other absurdities,) Tis certain you egregiously affront the <hi>mother of God</hi> in taking away her oile without her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, if you do not egregiously delude

the <hi>sons of men,</hi> in saying that her oyl will serve to feed their lamps; you may as well say that her good works will serve to nourish and sustain their Faith; or that her Faith will serve to purge and save their souls.</p>
               <p>And as for the other Saints, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not satisfie the Justice of God for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and much less for others, because there are two impediments of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in righteousnesse; (and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect righteousness, if it could <hi>be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> would in vain <hi>be communicated)</hi> The first is, the impediment of their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, the second is the impediment of their Actual sin: They are both affirmed together by the Holy Ghost, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20, 9, <hi>Who can say I have made my heart clean? sc.</hi> from my original corruption, <hi>I am pure from my sin, sc.</hi> from my actual transgression: He that cleanseth the heart, knoweth best how far he hath cleansed it; we cannot cleanse our hearts but by his help and assistance, (if we can, let us say no longer, <hi>Make me a clean heart O God)</hi> and he owneth no such cleansing in this world, but which still leaveth some uncleannesse behind it; He that hath made no use of his assistance, is not

at all concerned in this Interrogatory, <hi>Who can say I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</hi> He that hath made the best use thereof, is most concerned in it, and comprehended under it; therefore he cannot say <hi>I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sins,</hi> but he must lye to the Holy Ghost, and be so far from cleansing his heart, as immediatly to let in many unclean spirits the more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file it. For those two which God hath joyned together, all the wit and power of man, cannot put asunder, even <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans filling the heart, and lying to the Holy Ghost; why hath Satan filled thy heart to lye to the Holy Ghost?

as if all had been but one; and making this confession of her personal corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which proceeded from the natural, <hi>and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags,</hi> Isa. 64. 6. Wherefore since Protestants and Papists both agree together in the former part of this confession, as a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Divinity, 'tis irrational in the Papists to disagree from Protestants in the latter part of it, which is but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion proceeding from this Principle; For the <hi>natural</hi> corruption is the cause of the <hi>personal,</hi> and therefore all our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesses are as filthy rags, because we are all as an unclean thing; This being the full argumentation, <hi>All who are unclean, have an unclean righteousnesse; but we all are unclean, therefore we all have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean righteousnesse;</hi> Quia opus justitiae immundatur inquinamento, as saith <hi>Aquinas, because our righteousnesse is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed by our unrighteousnesse;</hi> and by this we may fully understand that other text, <hi>If we say that we have no sin we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 8.

                  <hi>them:</hi> The <hi>Jew</hi> was unclean by the touch of a dead body, and so is the <hi>Christian.

the former, (for obedience is better than sacrifice) And one of them when he saw that he was cleansed, turned back and with a loud voyce glorified God, and fell down on his face, at our Saviours feet, and gave him thanks; there's many good works together, one of devotion, <hi>he glorified God;</hi> another of zeal, <hi>with a loud voyce;</hi> a third of reverence, <hi>he fell down on his face;</hi> a fourth of humility, <hi>at our Saviours feet;</hi> a fifth of praise and thanksgiving, <hi>he gave him thanks;</hi> here is soul and body and all the powers and faculties of both, wholly set upon good works; yet our Saviour saith, <hi>Arise, go thy way, thy Faith hath made thee whole,</hi> v. 19.

Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> contrary to his custome trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates Testamenti: Hence it appears that your own Translators use these two words indifferently to signifie but one and the same thing as meer synonyma; insomuch as Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> above in the frontispiece writes novum faedus, and a little beneath, Novum Testamentum; I cannot see then what comfort you can have out of those words, <hi>Heb</hi> 9. 15. more then out of the rest; For in very deed Christs New Testament is no other then a new conditional Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us, by which we are bound cooperating with his Grace, to do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many things our selves (docentes eos servare omnia quaecunque mandavi vobis, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20.) for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the promised inheritance, wherein if we faile, we shal never attain thereto; For as your self say excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well, A covenant doth wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon mutual conditions, which if either party fail, the Covenant is broken and made of none effect.</q>

only to Christ, and fix all their hopes and delights upon him, for that the word Testament doth as expressely point at our Saviour Christs <hi>passion,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> Baptists finger did point at his <hi>Person,</hi> and doth in effect say what he said, Ecce Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Dei, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away the sins of the world!</hi> for he took away ous sins, <hi>by his death,</hi> plainly presig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, and necessarily included in the word <hi>Testament,</hi> because that could not be ratified and confirmed without his death; <hi>For where a Testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stator,</hi> Heb. 9. 16. But where a Covenant is, there must of necessity be the life of the Covenanter; Therefore if I will have the full comfort of the death of Christ, overcoming for me the sharpness of death, and opening to me the gates of everlasting life, and rescuing me from the guilt of sin, the terrors of hell, and the tyranny of the Devil; I must go to the <hi>Testament</hi> which tells me of Christs death, not to the <hi>Covenant</hi> which threatens <hi>mine own</hi> by shewing me the multiplyed offences of my sinful life: And in truth he that will deny this to be the proper signification of the word Testament, must

also deny St. <hi>Pauls</hi> argument, which here depends wholly upon the proper signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that word; <hi>And for this cause</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>He is the Mediator of the New Testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament, they which are called might receive the Promise of eternal inheritance; For where a Testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the Testator,</hi> Heb. 9. 15, 16. He saith not the Mediator <hi>of the New Covenant,</hi> which supposeth the life of the Covenanter, but <hi>of the New Testament</hi> which supposeth the death of the Testator; and accordingly he placeth all the strength of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the word <hi>Testament,</hi> which by vertue of Christs death gave us redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from transgressions, and admission to an eternal inheritance; So that we had need go to the <hi>Testament,</hi> not to the <hi>Covenant</hi> both for our <hi>Redemption</hi> and for our <hi>Inheritance:</hi> For the transgressions which were under the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> that of works (here called the <hi>First Testament,</hi> because as it was repeated by <hi>Moses,</hi> it was not dedicated without blood, <hi>v.</hi> 18; 19.) could not be expiated, but by the Redemption that was under the <hi>New</hi>

Ancient of dayes, or from the first Truth: <q>For in very deed (say you,) Christs New Testament is no other than a new conditional Covenant with us, by which we are bound, cooperating with his Grace, to do very many things our selves, for the obtaining of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed inheritance, wherein if we fail, we shall never attain thereto:</q> which seems to me a very <hi>strange Assertion,</hi> for so you have vented it; and yet a more <hi>strange definition,</hi> for so you seem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it: The Assertion is strange, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is <hi>Authentical,</hi> and yet withal <hi>Ambiguous,</hi> such as may be much admired, but little approved; For he that will speak <hi>positively,</hi> ought not to speak <hi>doubtfully,</hi> as you are positive in denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the irrecoverable losse of Heaven, but doubtful in declaring by what means we may prevent that losse; you speak with authority enough to terrifie us, but not with perspicuity enough to instruct us: You say plainly, <q>We are bound to do very many things for the obtaining of the promised inheritance, wherein if we fail we shall never attain thereto:</q> But you say not one word concerning any of those things wherein we are bound
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:105952:254"/>
not to faile; So you put our Salvation upon <hi>unknown</hi> conditions, which is the way to fill our souls with perplexity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of piety; and since what is not known, cannot be done, you may also put our Salvation upon <hi>impossible</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which is the way to turne our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity into desperation, our desperation into damnation.</p>
               <p n="8">8.

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:105952:254"/>
since it cannot fit both, which must needs be a very strange definition, confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Covenant it should explaine, for which cause it is <hi>Unlogical,</hi> very strange to reason; and making that one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God hath made two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, for which cause it is <hi>Untheological,</hi> very strange to Religion; For he which hath said, <hi>Those things which God hath joyned together let not man put asunder,</hi> Mat. 19. 6. hath thereby said (according to the rule of Contraries,) <hi>Those things which God hath put a sunder, let not man joyne together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And God hath put the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New</hi> Covenant as farre asunder, as he hath put Heaven and Hell: as he hath put Salvation and Damnation: For by the Old Covenant <hi>Do this and live,</hi> all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind after the Fall, must have perished; there's the Damnation; But by the new Covenant, <hi>Believe and thou shalt live;</hi> none that lay hold on Christ and keep with him, and stick to him, shall perish; there's the salvation: For S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us expressely, that God will judge the World, <hi>not by the Law</hi> which will condemn the most innocent and the most righteous, since the losse of our first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocen'cy

               <p n="10">10.

And so much of the Gospel was revealed to the Jews even whiles they were detained under the Law, as to let them see they were not saved or deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because they had performed the <hi>Duty,</hi> but because God would performe the <hi>Mercy</hi> of his Covenant; for this is the only reason that is given of their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of <hi>Egypt, God remembred his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob,</hi> Exod. 2. 24. which is farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and confirmed by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> in his story of their rebellions in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the Wilderness, and in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Ezek. 20. where all along the reason of Gods saving and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them, is only his own unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

But when he looks upon his own Promise in the Covenant, then it follows, <hi>But I wrought for my names sake,</hi> ver. 9, 14, 22. Throughout the whole Chapter there is a kind of dispute, betwixt Gods Justice and his Mercy; His Justice calling for their destruction, but his Mercy inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding for their deliverance: And this God would have registred not only by way of doctrine for their <hi>instruction,</hi> but also by way of praise and thanksgiving for their <hi>Devotion;</hi> Hence we find it also recorded in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> which were the chiefest part of their Liturgy, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. <hi>If they break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandements,</hi> ver. 32. <hi>Neverthelesse my Covenant will I not break,</hi> ver. 34.

                  <hi>at or for the powerful and perpetual oblation of the morning;</hi> shewing that this Psalm was given to the Priests and Levites, that it should be sung by them every morning to direct all their thoughts <hi>unto,</hi> and fix all their hops <hi>upon</hi> the death and passion of Christ (whereof this Psalm was rather a <hi>History</hi> then a <hi>Prophecy)</hi> through whom alone all their oblations were <hi>powerfull,</hi> and for whom they were <hi>Perpetual;</hi> through whom they were <hi>accepted,</hi> and for whom they were <hi>continued.</hi>

and consequently a better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant then the Jew, since these two are the parts of a Covenant; <hi>For all shall know me</hi> saith God, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. to comfort the Christian against his Ignorance; <hi>And I will be merciful to their unrighteousnesse;</hi> ver. 12. to comfort him against his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities: whereas the Law did only shew the Jew his Ignorance and his Infirmity, but did remedy neither: And upon this account the Spirit of God saith of our blessed Saviour, <hi>That he is the Mediator of a better Covenant;</hi> better not only <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally</hi> or <hi>extrinsecally,</hi> for the burden that is taken from it, and for the Grace that is given with it; but also better <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi> and <hi>intrinsecally</hi> (after some sort) for the better promises and better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that are given in it; For to the Jew who had <hi>Moses</hi> his veil cast over his face, and <hi>Moses</hi> his yoke cast upon his neck, the promise of the Covenant was clouded with darknesse, and the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant was clogged with difficulties, nay indeed with impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; But to the Christian, to whom that Veil is <hi>don away,</hi> and from whom that Yoke is <hi>taken away</hi> in Christ, both the Promise is clear and the Condition is

easie; He hath told us so, who made it so, <hi>My yoke is easie and my burden is light;</hi> Matth. 11. 30. For the promise of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer which was only foretold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured to the Jew, is verified to the Christian; and the condition of perfect Obedience which was enjoyned to them, is fulfilled for us; That Obedience which <hi>Moses</hi> required of the Jews, Christ hath performed for the Christians, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of the Apostle, <hi>Christ is the end of the Law for righteousnesse to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 10. 4.

And the true believer hath that both <hi>positively</hi> from the imputation of Christ righteousnesse, and <hi>negatively</hi> from the non-imputation, or from the remission of his own unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. Therefore it is no wonder that the Covenant under the Law and the Covenant under the Gospel are consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as two several Covenants, and that under the Gospel is called the <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> for that Covenant must needs be better which promiseth Salvation upon a <hi>possible,</hi> then that which promiseth it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an <hi>impossible</hi> condition; And such i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And if we thus consider the Law, we

light to the Sun-beam, the most glorious beam of the Sun of Righteousness; for by the consent of all Christians, the very ground upon which Christianity is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied against Judaisme, is this, That the Old Testament delivereth but the figure and the shadow of the New; wherefore we can go to the Old Testament only for the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and shadow, we must come to the New Testament for the body &amp; substance both of our Religion and of our Salvation.</p>

What was of Grace or Mercy in the Covenant by <hi>Moses,</hi> was not from <hi>Moses</hi> but from Christ: Not from the <hi>Covenant,</hi> but from the <hi>Testament;</hi> and therefore that was properly called <hi>a Covenant,</hi> because it gave life only upon the strict Rules of Justice; But this is more properly called <hi>a Testament,</hi> because it gives life upon the relaxation of those strict Rules of Justice, and admits the condescensions and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of mercy: Each Covenant is <hi>Conditional,</hi> promising everlasting life only to those who keep its Conditions; Bur the Covenant of Works promiseth life upon the Condition of <hi>Doing,</hi> accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only of perfect Righteousness and Obedience; The Covenant of Grace

In that our Jesus came to bless us by turning us from our iniquities, 'tis evident we must turn from our sins, or we cannot have his blessing; But in that 'tis He that blesseth us, 'tis as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent our blessing depends not upon our Obedience, but upon our Faith; not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our <hi>Own,</hi> but upon <hi>His</hi> Righteousness: Wherefore though we allow and affirme, that all things must be done by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which Christ hath commanded, and that Christ hath commanded all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties, that were before commanded by <hi>Moses,</hi> (for, <hi>Be ye perfect even as your</hi>

Wherefore I will
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:105952:269"/>
make bold to change your definition and say, <hi>Christs New Testament is a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Covenant with us, by which we are bound to repent for not perfectly doing all those things our selves, which God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, and to believe in him that hath perfectly done them all for us, that we may obtain the promised inheritance; in which condition if we fail,</hi> (sc. of believing, but not of Doing) <hi>we shall never attain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> for to put Doing (properly so taken, and 'tis not for a Divine to speak impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) as the Condition of life or Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to set up the Covenant of Works, not the Covenant of Grace, and that is to <hi>puzzle,</hi> not to <hi>Preach</hi> true Christianity: We find <hi>Adam</hi> had but one poor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement upon the first Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Not to eat of the fruit of one single Tree among so many, and he kept it not though he was endued with strength to keep it; he was to do but one thing whiles he had his perfect strength, and he did it not; And how can you say, that <hi>a better Covenant</hi> binds us <hi>to do many things,</hi> or else to forfeit our inheritance, now we have lost our strength, and are not able to do rightly and perfectly so much as one? Therefore pray let the Condition
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:105952:269"/>
of life in the second Covenant, not be our <hi>Doing,</hi> but our <hi>Believing;</hi> not our <hi>entire Obedience,</hi> but our <hi>entire Repentance;</hi> And let him alone have the glory of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience, who came from Heaven to purchase it: and the rather because he purchased it, not <hi>for himself</hi> but <hi>for us,</hi> allowing the <hi>benefit</hi> of it to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, though he reserve the <hi>glory</hi> of it only to himself: we must do the best we can to keep off, and to east out the great Dragon, that old Serpent called the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Satan; but pray let it be only the seed of the Woman that shall break this Serpents Head; and let not us think we are able to break it. Nor have you made the condition of Salvation any whit lighter or easier by saying <hi>we are bound to do many things</hi> our selves, then if you had said <hi>we are boun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> to do all things;</hi> For if Doing be the condition of life, it must reach to All Things that are to be done; else not Doing will be the Condition as well as Doing: And without doubt, if we can do any <hi>one thing</hi> so exactly and perfectly as fully to satisfie the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law, we may do <hi>many,</hi> and consequently <hi>All,</hi> and then what need we the seed of the Woman to break the
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:105952:270"/>
Serpents Head, since we can break it our selves? for if we can take away his <hi>sting,</hi> we may easily break his <hi>Head;</hi> Now the sting of the Serpent is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law: Therefore if the Law be fully kept, sin can have no strength, and the Serpent can have no sting.</p>
               <p>I do not think there is in all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom so religious a Votarie but will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that the old Serpent hath at some time or other by his sophistry beguiled him, with his venome defiled him, by his power overcome him, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in himself he hath been captivated under Ignorance, guiltinesse, and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, even through his actual sins, and should still have been detained under that captivity, if God had not merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given him such a Redeemer who was pleased to be his Prophet to instruct his Ignorance, his Priest to expiate his guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness, and his King to strengthen his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; If he confesse this, he hath great reason to mistrust his own <hi>doing:</hi> If he confesse it not, He hath the greater reason to instruct himself. For his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance keeping him from the <hi>knowledge</hi> of what he is to do, his guiltiness keeping
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:105952:270"/>
him from the <hi>desire,</hi> and his weaknesse keeping him from the <hi>power</hi> of doing it, he cannot hope to be saved by his <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> but by his <hi>Faith;</hi> not by his <hi>Doing,</hi> but by his <hi>Believing,</hi> Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached the Covenant of Grace, saying, <hi>He was an Apostle of Jesus Christ, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Faith of Gods Elect, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Truth which is after Godlinesse;</hi> there's the Obligation to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness in the Covenant of Grace; But this righteousnesse is not the condition of life in that Covenant; for it follows, <hi>In hope of eternal life which God that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lye promised before the world began,</hi> Tit. 1. 1, 2. The eternal life is not annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>mans performance,</hi> but to <hi>Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;</hi> not to <hi>mans duty,</hi> but to <hi>Gds mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi> For this promise of eternal life was made before man was created, and it was made to Christ, (the eternal Son of God,) on mans behalf, <hi>That all who should believe in him according to the Faith of Gods Elect, and the acknowledgement of the Truth which is after Godliness, should through that Faith come to eternal life:</hi> Upon this Promise did God seek us when we were lost, restore us when we were dead, reconcile us when we were his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:105952:271"/>
and upon this same promise will he save us now we are his Servants: For though all men are lyars and <hi>fail of their Godliness,</hi> yet God that cannot lye will not <hi>fail of his promise;</hi> Thus again saith the same St. <hi>Paul, For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son; much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life,</hi> Rom. 5. 10. There was first an <hi>Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to be made for our reconciliation, before there could be a <hi>Covenant</hi> made for our Salvation: And as mans righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness did not make the Atonement, so neither doth mans righteousnesse fulfill the Covenant: we are eternally obliged (and should be wholy devoted) to our blessed Saviour for both alike; as That we have been reconciled, so also that we shall be saved; And therefore we must take that for the condition of Salvation in the Covenant of Grace, which sends us immediately to Him, to wit <hi>Our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving;</hi> and not that which sends us to our selves (though it proceed from him) to wit <hi>Our Doing:</hi> Thus hath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mother of all Christians, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, taught all her sons to pray, <hi>That in all our works begun; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued</hi>

but it assures Life upon our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned faith and repentance; And it is so far from diminishing or lessening any wilful sin, (either of omission or of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission) that it rather augments and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates the same; For whereas wilful offenders did before trample under foot <hi>the Word of God,</hi> whereby they should have been <hi>restrained;</hi> now they also tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under foot <hi>the Blood of God,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have been <hi>redeemed</hi> from their fins.

To fosake the Devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of the wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh. 2. To believe all the Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith. 3. To keep Gods holy will and Commandements, and to walk in the same all the daies of their life; And every childe that is trained up in our Church, knows he was bound to all these when he first received the Seal of the New Covenant, and therefore cannot but look upon all these as the material parts of his Obligation by that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and upon himself as a most perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious wretch if He wilfully fail in any

part of his Obligation, and as a most miserable wretch if he do not earnestly repent of his failings; But will you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore say, That because he hath failed in these, he hath forfeited his Salvation? Is Doing all these (as they ought to be done, for else 'tis not doing of them) the formal part of the Covenant of Grace, or the condition of life in that Covenant? May we not say That he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes the world, the flesh and the Devil, <hi>who doth not follow and is not led by them?</hi> That he believes all the Articles of the Christian Faith, who cries out with tears, <hi>Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief;</hi> and that he keeps Gods Commandements, who prays with hearty sorrow, <hi>Lord have mercy upon me,</hi> and with hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, <hi>Incline my heart to keep thy Law,</hi> or <hi>write all thy Laws in my heart I beseech thee:</hi> If we may say so, then this is that which God requires to our Salvation, and by this we perform the condition of that Covenant by which we hope to be saved: wherefore though Doing be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived into the <hi>Constitution,</hi> yet it is not derived into the <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant:</hi> The Constitution of the New Covenant is, (as it was of the Old,) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
