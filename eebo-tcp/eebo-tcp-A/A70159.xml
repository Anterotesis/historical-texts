         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The laſt meanes of <hi>preſervation</hi> according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
preſcrips of <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> is that which ought to be the
firſt and chiefeſt in the care and practiſe of every wiſe man.
Namely, <hi>the fortifying and defending the heart and vitall parts
by Cordials,</hi> againſt the venime and poyſon of that perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
diſeaſe. For although there be no member, no entrall,
no part or particle of the whole body of man, which doth
not feele the inſulting cruelty and rageing tyranny of this
acute deſtroying diſeaſe; yet of all the reſt the <hi>heart</hi> is the
moſt infected, corrupted, tortured and afflicted with its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiferous
venome; becauſe the <hi>heart</hi> is the <hi>magazine</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
heat, the <hi>royall fort</hi> of life, and the <hi>fountaine</hi> of all the
vitall Spirits; which being once vanquiſhed and taken, the
victory over all the other parts of man is moſt eaſie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite:
and it is the nature and property of all poyſon, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
of this moſt ſubtle and deadly poyſon, chiefely and
principally to aſſault and invade, and ſo to waſt and ruine
the native heat, and vitall ſpirits, and in them life it ſelfe.
It may, and doth make its way to the heart by, or through o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the body, and ſo perhaps ſhewes it ſelfe in
them firſt: but 'tis the ſurpriſing and overcomming the
<hi>heart</hi> which it principally aimes, and drives at. Take this
either <hi>literally</hi> of the <hi>Body-Plague,</hi> or <hi>Allegorically</hi> of the
<hi>Soule-Plague;</hi> you will finde it moſt true of both. The

adds very little for the <hi>curing</hi> of the <hi>Plague</hi> to what he had

therefore doth ſo, firſt, becauſe the ſame <hi>phyſicke,</hi> eſpecially
the <hi>Cordiall Phyſicke,</hi> that is good for <hi>preſervation,</hi> is as
good as can be thought on, in ordinary caſes, for <hi>cure,</hi> only
where need requires, as it doth in the moſt, the quantity of
the ingredients muſt be augmented. Secondly, becauſe mens
tempers and conſtitutions as I before told you are ſo differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and in a manner contrary, and the poyſon of the diſeaſe
infecteth and corrupteth in ſuch different wayes and degrees
that 'tis not good, ſcarce ſafe either for <hi>Phyſitian</hi> or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
