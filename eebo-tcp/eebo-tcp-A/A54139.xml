            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>VVHen the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Wiſe God</hi> had made the World, of all his Creatures it pleaſed him to chuſe <hi>Man</hi> his <hi>Deputy</hi> to Rule it: And to fit him for ſo great a Charge and Truſt, he did not only qualifie him with <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> but with <hi>Integrity</hi> to uſe them juſtly. This <hi>Native Goodneſs</hi> was equally his Honour and his Happineſs; and whilſt he ſtood here, all went well: There was no need of <hi>Coercive</hi> or <hi>Compulſive means;</hi> the Precept of <hi>Divine Love</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> in his own Boſom was the <hi>Guide</hi> and <hi>Keeper</hi> of his Innocency. But <hi>Luſt</hi> prevailing againſt <hi>Duty,</hi> made a lamentable Breach upon it; and the <hi>Law,</hi> that before had no Power over him, took place upon him and his Diſobedient Poſterity, that ſuch as would not live conformable to the <hi>holy Law within,</hi> ſhould fall under the Reproof and Correction of the <hi>juſt Law without</hi> in a Judicial Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>This the Apoſtle teaches in divers of his Epiſtles: <hi>The Law</hi> (ſays he) <hi>was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſion:</hi> In another place; <hi>Knowing that the Law was not made for the Righteous Man, but for the Diſobedient and Vngodly, for Sinners, for Vnholy and Prophane, for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, for Whoremongers, for them that Defile themſelves with Mankind, and for Men-ſtealers, for Lyars, for Perjured Perſons, &amp;c.</hi> But this is not all, he opens and carries the matter of <hi>Government</hi> a little farther; <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Powers; for there is no Power but of God. The Powers that be, are ordained of God: Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God. For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works, but to Evil: Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power, Do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have Praiſe of the ſame—He is the Miniſter of God to thee for good—Wherefore, ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for Wrath, but for Conſcience ſake.</hi> This ſettles the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Exception, and that for two ends: Firſt, <hi>To Terrifie Evil-Doers:</hi> Secondly, <hi>To Cheriſh thoſe that do Well;</hi> which gives <hi>Government</hi> a Life beyond Corruption, and makes it as <hi>durable</hi> in the World, as <hi>Good Men</hi> ſhall be. So that <hi>Government</hi> ſeems to me a part of <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf, a thing <hi>Sacred</hi> in its <hi>Inſtitution</hi> and <hi>End:</hi> for if it does not directly remove the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> it cruſhes the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Evil,</hi> and is as ſuch (though a lower, yet) an Emanation of the ſame <hi>Divine Power,</hi> that is both <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> the Difference lying here, that the One is more <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Mental,</hi> the Other, more <hi>Corporal</hi> and <hi>Compulſive</hi> in its Operations: But that is only to <hi>Evil-doers; Government</hi> in it ſelf being otherwiſe as capable of <hi>Kindneſs, Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> as a more private Society. They weakly Err, that think there is no other uſe for <hi>Government,</hi> than <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> which is the courſeſt part of it: Daily experience tells us, that the Care and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of many other Affairs, more ſoft and daily neceſſary, make up much the greateſt part of <hi>Government;</hi> and which muſt have followed the <hi>Peopling</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> had <hi>Adam</hi> never fell, and will continue among Men on Earth under the higheſt Attainments they may arrive at, by the Coming of the bleſſed <hi>Second Adam,</hi> the <hi>Lord from Heaven.</hi>—Thus much of <hi>Government</hi> in <hi>General,</hi> as to its Riſe and End.</p>
            <p>For <hi>particular Frames</hi> and <hi>Models,</hi> it will become me to ſay little; and comparatively I will ſay nothing. My Reaſons are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Age</hi> is too <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi> for it, there being nothing the <hi>Wits</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> are more <hi>buſie</hi> and <hi>divided</hi> upon. 'Tis true, they ſeem to agree in the <hi>end,</hi> to wit, <hi>Happineſs;</hi> but in the <hi>means</hi> they differ, as to Divine, ſo to this Humane <hi>Felicity;</hi> and the cauſe is much the ſame, not alwayes want of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> but want of uſing them rightly. Men ſide with their <hi>Paſſions</hi> againſt their <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and their <hi>ſiniſter Intereſts</hi> have ſo ſtrong a Byaſs upon their minds, that they lean to them againſt the good of the things they know.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96946:3"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I do not find a Model in the World, that <hi>Time, Place</hi> and ſome ſingular Emer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gencies have not neceſſarily alter'd; nor is it eaſie to frame a <hi>Civil Government,</hi> that ſhall ſerve all places alike.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I know what is ſaid by the ſeveral Admirers of <hi>Monarchy, Ariſtocracy</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy,</hi> whith are the Rule of <hi>One,</hi> a <hi>Few</hi> and <hi>Many,</hi> and are the <hi>Three Common Idea's</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> when men diſcourſe of that Subject. But I chuſe to ſolve the Controverſie with this ſmall Diſtinction, and it belongs to all <hi>three:</hi> Any <hi>Government</hi> is <hi>Free</hi> to the People under it (what-ever be the Frame) <hi>where the Laws Rule, and the People are a Party to thoſe Laws,</hi> and more then this is <hi>Tyranny, Oligarchy</hi> or <hi>Confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Laſtly,</hi> when all is ſaid, there is hardly one <hi>Frame</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> in the World ſo ill deſign'd by its firſt Founders, that in <hi>good hands</hi> would not do well enough; and Story tells us, The <hi>Beſt</hi> in <hi>Ill Ones</hi> can do nothing that is <hi>great</hi> or <hi>good;</hi> witneſs the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> States. <hi>Governments,</hi> like Clocks, go from the motion Men give them; and as <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments</hi> are made and mov'd by <hi>Men,</hi> ſo by <hi>Them</hi> they are Ruin'd too: wherefore <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments</hi> rather depend upon <hi>Men,</hi> then <hi>Men</hi> upon <hi>Governments.</hi> Let <hi>Men</hi> be <hi>good,</hi> and the <hi>Government</hi> can't be <hi>bad;</hi> if it be <hi>ill,</hi> they will cure it: but if <hi>Men</hi> be <hi>bad,</hi> let the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> be never ſo <hi>good,</hi> they will endeavour to warp and ſpoil it to their Turn.</p>
            <p>I know ſome ſay, <hi>Let us have <hi>good Laws,</hi> and no matter for the <hi>Men</hi> that Execute them:</hi> But let them conſider, that though <hi>good Laws</hi> do <hi>well, good Men</hi> do <hi>better;</hi> for <hi>good Laws</hi> may want <hi>good Men,</hi> and be aboliſhed or evaded by <hi>ill Men;</hi> but <hi>good Men</hi> will never want <hi>good Laws</hi> nor ſuffer <hi>Ill Ones.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>good Laws</hi> have ſome Awe upon <hi>Ill Miniſters,</hi> but that is where They have not Power to eſcape or aboliſh them, and the People are generally wiſe and good: But a looſe and deprav'd People (which is to the Queſtion) love Laws and an Adminiſtration like themſelves. That therefore which makes a good Conſtitution muſt keep it; <hi>(viz.) Men of Wiſdom and Virtue;</hi> qualities, that becauſe they deſcend not with Worldly Inheritances, muſt be carefully propagated by a <hi>virtuous Education</hi> of Youth; for which After-Ages will owe more to the care and prudence of Founders and the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> then to their <hi>Parents</hi> for their private Patrimonies.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations of the Weight of <hi>Government,</hi> and the nice and various Opinions about it, made it uneaſie to Me to think of publiſhing the enſuing <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Conditional Laws,</hi> foreſeeing, both the Cenſures they will meet with from Men of differing Humors and engagements, and the occaſion they may give of diſcourſe beyond my deſign.</p>
            <p>But next to the Power of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> (which is a Solicitor that will take no denial) this induc'd me to a Compliance, that we have (with <hi>Reverence</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>good Conſcience</hi> to <hi>Men)</hi> to the beſt of our Skill contrived and compoſed the <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of this <hi>Government</hi> to the great <hi>End</hi> of all <hi>Government,</hi> viz. <hi>To ſupport Power in Reverence with the People, And to ſecure the People from the abuſe of Power;</hi> that they may be <hi>Free</hi> by their <hi>juſt Obedience,</hi> and the Magiſtrates <hi>Honourable</hi> for their <hi>juſt Adminiſtration:</hi> For <hi>Liberty</hi> without <hi>Obedience</hi> is Confuſion, and <hi>Obedience</hi> without <hi>Liberty</hi> is Slavery. To carry this Evenneſs is partly owing to the <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> and partly to the <hi>Magiſtracy;</hi> where either of theſe fail, <hi>Government</hi> will be ſubject to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions:</hi> but where <hi>both</hi> are wanting, it muſt be totally ſubverted: Then where <hi>both</hi> meet, the <hi>Government</hi> is like to endure: Which I humbly pray and hope, God will pleaſe to make the <hi>Lot</hi> of <hi>This</hi> of <hi>Pennſilvania:</hi> Amen.</p>
