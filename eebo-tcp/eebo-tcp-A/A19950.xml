            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This Epiſtle was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſed by the Lord <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Peron,</hi> without any purpoſe to haue it ſeene in publike, but rather with delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration not to impart it ſo much as to his very familiar friends. But a Copie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being by chance gotten, it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently printed in <hi>Paris,</hi> with many faults, yea and with ſome hereſies. And although the foreſaid Cardinall vſed all diligence to haue it ſuppreſſed, cauſing the Copies to be ſeyzed on by the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Iuſtice, and the Printer to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for publiſhing them without his knowledge: yet was there ſoone after another impreſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made therof in <hi>Roan,</hi>

And this we do at this preſent, diſclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from all the former copies, and whatſoeuer elſe not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to this.</p>

            <p>THE Letter which you deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to <hi>Monſieur de la Boderie,</hi> to be giuen me, I receaued when I was vpon my departure, taking my iourney into <hi>Normandie.</hi> Since my returne, I haue bene allwaies ſick; which hath bene the cauſe, that my Anſwer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth no ſooner to your hands. But now, that my infirmity alloweth me ſome little eaſe, I will pay the arrierages of my former ſlackneſſe. And firſt I yield you many thankes, for the pleaſure you did me, in ſhewing my Letter to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23146:4"/>
his Maieſty of <hi>Great-Britaine,</hi> and procuring me ſome part in his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fauour; which I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour ſo to increaſe by moſt humble ſeruices, and particulerly by ſetting forth his Royall Praiſes (the only fruite, which good and vertuous Kings, ſuch as his Maieſty is, do receaue of the thorny cares anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed to Royall Gouernement) as he ſhall haue no cauſe to be ſorie, that Poſterity know the honour, which his Maieſty did me with his Royall fauour, and the Reuerence and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration I had of his Princelie ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>As for the Tranſlation of <hi>Virgils</hi> verſe, wherof you ſay his Maieſty deſired a Copie, that being loſt, which before I ſent you, I muſt differre for ſome daies the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this duty, for that I haue cauſed it to be printed againe with an Addition of one part of the fourth; which for his Maieſties ſake
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23146:4"/>
I haue of purpoſe added, to make therof vnto him a more ample and worthy preſent; and as ſoone as ſome few Copies ſhalbe finiſhed, I will not fayle to ſend you one, that you may preſent it to his Maieſty in my name.</p>
            <p>There reſteth now the third point of your Letter; which is, that his Maieſty much meruailed at theſe wordes of mine, where I ſayd, that excepting the only Title of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> there was nothing wanting in his Royall Perſon, to expreſſe the liuelie patterne of a Prince, comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely endued with all Princely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: and that he pretended the Title of <hi>Catholike,</hi> could not be denied him, ſince he belieued all thoſe things, which the ancient Fathers with vniforme conſent eſteemed neceſſary to ſaluation.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwere, that as on the one ſide I cannot but greatly praiſe the Chriſtian humility of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23146:5"/>
his Maieſty, in that he refuſeth not to ſubmit his Iudgement, adorned with ſo rare light of Nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by Induſtrie, to thoſe bright ſhining Lampes of Antiquity; imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating herein the prudence of the Great Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who thought no other meanes more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the compoſing of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions, wherewith the Church was moleſted in his time, then to demaund of both parties, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, that the ancient Fathers, who flouriſhed before their conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions began, had the true faith; which they confeſſing, he required them to ſubmit themſelues to that, which they ſhould find to haue byn belieued by the ancient Fathers: ſo on the other ſide, there are diuers things to be obſerued vpon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes before we come to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; which for that I haue not meanes to preſent to his Maieſty, I ſhalbe content to informe you of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23146:5"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for your particuler ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that the Name of <hi>Catholike,</hi> is not a Name of only Beliefe, but of Communion; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ancient Fathers would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue refuſed to giue this Name to them, that were ſeparated from them, not in beliefe, but in the communion &amp; vnity of the Church. Neither would they euer haue affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that out of the Catholike Church they might haue Faith and Sacraments, but not Saluation.
<q>Out of the Catholike Church (ſaith <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> in his Treatiſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference had with <hi>Emeritus</hi>) a man may haue all things, excepting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: he may haue Orders, he may haue Sacraments, he may ſing <hi>Alleluia,</hi> he may anſwere <hi>Amen,</hi> he may haue the Ghoſpell, he may haue, and preach the faith in the Name of the Father, &amp; of the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, and of the holy Ghoſt; but he can by no meanes obtaine ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

            <p>And in his booke <hi>de vtilitate credendi.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 7.</note>
               <q>There is one Church, as all do confeſſe: and if you looke on the whole compaſſe of the world, it exceedeth all others in number: and as they affirme that know, it is more ſincere in the doctrine of the Truth. But this is another queſtion. That which ſufficeth for our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is, that there is one Catholike Church, to which diuers hereſies haue giuen different Names, when as euery of them haue their proper Names, which they dare not deny: by which it may eaſily appeare, to whome the Name of <hi>Catholike,</hi> of which all are deſirous, ought to be attributed.</q>

There doth hould me the conſent of people and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the authority which had her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning by miracles, nouriſhed by hope, augmented by charity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by antiquity. There doth hould me the Succeſſion of Biſhops vntill this preſent day, from the very Seate of <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom our Lord committed the feeding of his ſheepe after his Reſurrection, to the Epiſcopall dignity of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Biſhop. And laſtly this very name <hi>Catholike</hi> doth hould me in the vnity of this Church; which name this Church hath alwaies, not without cauſe, amongſt ſo many different ſects of hereſies, in ſuch ſort obtained, that although all heretiks deſire to be called <hi>Catholiks</hi>; yet if a Stranger ſhould demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d where is the Aſſembly of the Catholike Church, there is no Heretike that dareth to aſſigne him his Temple, or his houſe.</q>

            <p>Whence it followeth, that it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth not, for the obtaining of the Name <hi>Catholike,</hi> to hould, or rather to thinke we do hould the ſelf ſame beliefe of the ancient Fathers, if we do not participate with them in the Vnity and Communion of the ſame Catholike Church, with which the ſame ancient Fathers did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and which by ſucceſſion of perſons, and, as we further pretend, by the ſucceſſion alſo of doctrine is deſcended vnto vs. And if ſhe hath loſt any part of her greatnes in our Hemiſphere, ſhe hath gotten as much, or more, in the other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere, that is vnder vs: that ſo thoſe ancient Propheſies may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled;<note place="margin">Gen. 26.</note>

            </p>
            <p>The ſecond obſeruation is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reſtriction to things, neceſſary to ſaluation. For beſides thoſe that are neceſſary to ſaluation, there are two other degrees of things: the one, of ſuch as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to ſaluation: as, according to the iudgment of your Miniſters, is the ſelling of all that a man hath, and giuing it to the poore. Likewiſe to faſt in time of afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to appeaſe the indignation of God; to pray for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23146:10"/>
the brethren that are of the ſame faith with vs; to pray to Almighty God for our owne neceſſities. The other degree is of things lawfull, &amp; not repugnant to ſaluation; as to flie in time of perſecution, and for ſuch as ſerue the Altar, to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Altar; to put away the wife that is Adultreſſe, and the like. For I alleage theſe, as exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, and not for inſtances. Now for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire conformity with the beliefe of the ancient Fathers, it is neceſſary, that we belieue all thoſe things which they belieued, euery one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degree in which they were held by them; that is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue thoſe things to be neceſſary to ſaluation, which they reputed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie; and thoſe things profitable to ſaluation, which they eſteemed ſo: and likewiſe to belieue thoſe things to be lawfull, and not repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant to ſaluation, which they did hold for lawfull &amp; not repugnant:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23146:11"/>
and that vnder colour, that theſe two laſt degrees are not of things neceſſary to ſaluation, but only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable or lawfull, we ſhould not condemne them, nor ſeparate our ſelues for any reſpect of them from the Church, which did, and doth practiſe them.</p>
            <p>The third obſeruation is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ambiguity of the words (<hi>neceſſarie to ſaluation</hi>) which for that there are diuers kindes of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities in matters of Religion, may be diuerſly taken. For there is one neceſſity, which is called <hi>Abſolute,</hi> and another <hi>Conditionall.</hi> There is a neceſſitie of the meanes to do a thing, and there is a neceſſitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the precept, by which we are commaunded to do it. There is alſo a neceſſitie of ſpeciall and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler beliefe, and a neceſſitie of beliefe in generall: a neceſſitie of act, and laſtly a neceſſity of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. I call abſolute neceſſity (not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23146:11"/>
that it is ſimply ſo, but for that God hath ſo ordained it) that which admitteth no excuſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, nor any exception of place, time, or perſon. Of this kind is the knowledge and beliefe of Chriſt, the Mediatour betweene God and man, which is of abſolute neceſſitie to be knowne of all that be of age. For it is not excuſed with the circumſtance of not being in place, where one may be inſtructed, nor with the condition of being i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnorant and vnlearned, rude, and of little capacity, a ſheepe, and not a ſheepheard: for none of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions can defend them from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death, that do not actually belieue. Foraſmuch as whoſoeuer belieueth not in the only begotten Sonne of God, is allreadie iudged.<note place="margin">Ioan· 3.</note> And of the ſame neceſſitie to little infants, is the receauing of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſme, by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, according to the doctrine of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23146:12"/>
Catholikes, the faith in Chriſt is in them ſupplyed: following herein the ſentence of S <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">lib. 3. de an. &amp; eius orig. c. 9.</note> who ſaith:
<q>Do not belieue, do not ſay, do not teach, that the Infants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by death, before they be baptized, can obtaine remiſſion of Originall ſinne, if thou will be a Catholike.</q>
And of this kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, there are but few examples.</p>
            <p>I call that neceſſitie <hi>Conditionall,</hi> which obligeth not, but when there is poſſibility, and admitteth excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of place, time, and perſons: and this againe is ſubdeuided into many branches. For firſt of all (to ſpeake of matters which concerne Faith) there are many points, which neceſſarily are to be belieued by him, that is in place, where he may be inſtructed, or hath time to informe himſelf, which are not neceſſary to another, that liueth in a deſert, or is ſo ſuddainly preuented by death, that he hath no leaſure
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23146:12"/>
to be inſtructed: as, that Chriſt was borne of a Virgin, that he was crucified vnder <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> that he roſe againe the third day. And many things are neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued and held for points of Faith, either by the whole body of the Church in generall, or by the order of Miniſters or Paſtours, who are the eies of the Church, which be not neceſſary to be knowne and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued as articles of Faith by euery one in particuler: As, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the bleſſed Trinity are one in Eſſence, and diſtinct in Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence: that the Father hath begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Sonne of neceſſity, and not of free accord; that they are the diuine Perſons which do produce, and are produced, and not the Eſſence which doth neither produce, nor is produced; that the externall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the bleſſed Trinity are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuided: that the only Perſon of the Sonne hath taken fleſh, and not any
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23146:13"/>
of the others: that in Chriſt there are two Subſtances, and one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence: that the Diuinity was not in place of the ſoule, but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the body and Diuinity, there was in Chriſt alſo a ſenſible and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoule: that what Chriſt did once perſonally vnite vnto him, he doth neuer abandone: that the Diuel was created good, and by the liberty of his owne free will, he became euill; and other the like.</p>
            <p>And as for the neceſſity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there are many things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, when there is poſſibility and opportunity of times, of places, and of perſons; which are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary abſolutely, and when theſe commodities and meanes to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me them, are wanting: As to aſſiſt at Eccleſiaſticall ſolemnities; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue actually the Euchariſt. And many things are neceſſary to ſome, as Miſſion and Impoſition of hands to the Paſtours of the Church; and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23146:13"/>
Marriage to ſuch as deſire lawfull ofſpring, which are not neceſſary to others. And briefly, other things are needfull for the obtayning of ſaluation, and others for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it with more facility: others for the obtaining of it for ones ſelf, and others for the procuring and getting of it for another: others for the conſtitution of the Church, and others for the edification and more large propagation of the Church: others for the meere being of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and others for the better being, that is, for the dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, dignity, and ſplendour therof. I call neceſſity of meanes that which is in the things themſelues we vſe, as that of the Sacraments, to which God hath giuen power, for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting of Grace, and the reall coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration to the health of a mans ſoule, That alſo of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the morall law, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity wherof is impoſed by the order
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23146:14"/>
of nature. In like manner the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of repenting for our ſinnes, which is a neceſſary meane for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of pardon.</p>
            <p>I call that neceſſity of Precept, which proceedeth only from the force of commaundment, as is the keeping holy of the firſt day in the weeke, in memorie of that day in which our Sauiour roſe from death, and which for this cauſe is called <hi>Dies Dominicus,</hi> that is, the day of our Lord, and other the like obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations; the omiſſion of which, would nothing endanger ſaluation, if it were not for diſobedience and the breaking of the precept, by which they are commaunded. I call neceſſitie of particuler and ſpeciall beliefe, the neceſſity of thoſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which all faithfull ſoules not preuented by death are bound to know and belieue with an expreſſe, diſtinct, and determinate faith, which in Schooles is called <hi>Fides
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23146:14"/>
ex licita</hi>: and of this kind, are the twelue Articles of our Creed.</p>
            <p>Neceſſity of generall beliefe comprehendeth thoſe things, which euery one in particuler is not bound to belieue in diſtinct and expreſſe manner; as the doctrine of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne; the article of two wills in Chriſt; the proceeding of the holy Ghoſt from the Father and the Sonne; the force of Baptiſme giuen in due forme out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church; and that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by heretikes are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, when they returne to the vnity of the Church, and other the like, which euery ſimple and rude Chriſtian is not bound expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſtinctly to belieue, but it ſufficeth, that they belieue them in generall, in the faith of the Church, that is, that they adhere, and be vnited to the Church, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieueth them; in the faith whereof they liue as long, as they remaine
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23146:15"/>
in her communion and vnity; in like manner as the infant liueth by the food receaued by the mother, as long as it is within her wombe.</p>
            <p>Neceſſity of Act I call that, which is of thoſe things, which euery one in particuler is bound actually to do: As to profeſſe the name of Chriſt, to pardon receaued iniuries, to reſtore the goods of others vniuſtly detayned. Neceſſity of approbation is of thoſe things, which euery one in particuler is not bound actually to execute; but he is bound not to contradict, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thoſe that do them, nor the Church which doth approue them, nor for any diſlike of them to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelues from the Church, vnder paine of being excluded from euerlaſting ſaluation. Of this ſort is the choice of liuing a chaſt and ſingle life, and other the like. Of all which kindes of Neceſſitie the ancient Fathers held many things,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23146:15"/>
ech one in his degree, differently neceſſary to ſaluation: as we will ſhew in thoſe particulers, which ſhalbe preſented to be examined. Now if we hold the points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or of action, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eſteemed neceſſary for ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to ſome of theſe neceſſities, and do reiect the reſt, we cannot for this be ſaid to agree in beliefe with the ancient Fathers: but it is further needfull to hold and eſteeme all thoſe things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſaluation, which the ancient Fathers did eſteeme to be neceſſary, euery one in the degree, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the kind of neceſſity, as they were eſteemed by them.</p>
            <p>The fourth Obſeruation is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the word <hi>(Ancient)</hi> which ſome, when they ſhould come to performe their promiſe of ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their iudgment to Antiquity, do reſtraine to the firſt or ſecond Age immediatly after the Apoſtles,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23146:16"/>
not for that they hope to find within that ſpace any ancient Father, that doth fauour them, but for that the Church being then oppreſſed with perſecutions, left vs but few wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of that Date; and thoſe for the moſt part againſt ſuch perſons, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſuch matters, as do ſo little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s now in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy, as the face of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, &amp; the practiſe of the Church in thoſe dayes, cannot be fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented vnto vs &amp; knowne. But reaſon and equity requireth, that if we wil confer the eſtate of the Sects of this age, which would chalenge to themſelues the Title of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, with the eſtate of the ancient Church; we ſhould take a time, wherin not only our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitours do agree with vs, that the Church of that age was the true Church, &amp; the true Spouſe of Ieſus Chriſt, and that ſhe had lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to iudge and determine the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23146:16"/>
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies in matters of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but alſo it behoueth vs to take ſuch a tyme, of which we haue ſufficient Monuments and Records, to ſhew cleerly vnto vs the doctrine &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of that Church, which cannot in any ſort be better found then in the tymes of the foure firſt Councels, that is, from the tyme of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, who was the firſt Emperour that publikly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtian Religion, to the tyme of the Emperour <hi>Martian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it ſeemeth his Maieſty doth liberally accord, not onely to this, but to much more in ſome of his writings, hauing extended the continuance of the true Church, to the whole ſpace of the fiue firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. For beſides that the freedome from the yoke of ſeruitude of the Pagans, gaue place to the Church then to ſpeake with more liberty, and to haue more free communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with all the parts belonging
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23146:17"/>
vnto it, diſperſed in diuers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys and Kingdomes, and to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in a greater multitude of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and excellent Writers, which hath bene the cauſe, that we haue at this preſent without compariſon, many more teſtimonyes of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to diſcouer the entire and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect forme of the ancient Chriſtian Religion, then we haue of the other ages which went before. Beſides this, I ſay, our Aduerſaryes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but that Church, which was nouriſhed with the breſts of the firſt Chriſtian Emperours, and which deſtroyed the Temples, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the ſeruice and honour done to falſe Gods, and exerciſed the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Tribunall of ſpirituall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on earth, by the ſentence of condemnation, which ſhe pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt the foure moſt famous Hereſies, in the foure firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councells, which were the foure firſt generall Aſſemblyes, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23146:17"/>
Parlaments of Eſtate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, was that Church of whom it was fortould, that ſhe ſhould ſuck the breſts of Kings;<note place="margin">Iſa. 62.54.</note> and that Nations ſhould walke in her light, and Kings in the brightneſſe of her orient; that all attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her ſhould be deſtroyed; that ſhe ſhould iudge euery tongue that reſiſted in iudgement; that God had put watchmen vpon her walles, who ſhould not be ſilent day or night for all eternity;<note place="margin">Matth. 16.18.</note> that the gates of Hell ſhould not preuaile againſt her; and whoſoeuer refuſed to heare her, ſhould be eſteemed as a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane and Heathen:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.</note> and briefly that ſhe was the pillar and firmament of truth.
<q>Shall we doubt,<note place="margin">de vtilitate cred. c. 17.</note> ſaith <hi>Saint Auguſtine,</hi> to put our ſelues in the boſome of that Church, which by  ſucceſſion of Biſhops from the Seat of the Apoſtles, to the vniuerſall confeſſion of mankind, the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes barking on all ſides, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23146:18"/>
partly by the iudgement of the very people, and partly by the Maieſty of miracles, hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the higheſt degree of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which not to obey and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is an act of extreme impiety or precipitous arrogancie.</q> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.<note place="margin">De ſymb. ad Catech. lib. 1. c. 5.</note> 
               <q>The Catholike Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting all Heretikes may be impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but neuer ouercome: al hereſies haue come out of her, as vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble branches cut off from the vine, but ſhe remaineth ſtill in her roote, in her vine, in her charity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That doctrine therefore ſhall truly be ſayd to be ancient, and marked with the character of the primitiue Church, which ſhalbe found to haue bene belieued and practiſed vniuerſally by the Fathers, who liued in the time of the foure firſt Generall Councells; and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally when it ſhall appeare, that the things affirmed by the authors of thoſe ages, were not held by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23146:18"/>
them as doctrines and obſeruations of their owne, but as doctrines and obſeruations perpetually practiſed by the Church in all ages, from the time of the Apoſtles: although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there cannot be found ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny expreſſe teſtimonies of euery one of thoſe things within the compaſſe of the precedent ages, as may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the time of the foure firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, by reaſon of the ſmall ſtore of writings, which the Perſecution of thoſe times ſuffered to come to our hands. For it ſufficeth to aſſure vs of the perpetuall practice of thoſe matters, that the Fathers who liued in the time of the foure firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and knew better then we what paſſed in the ages that went before them, do teſtify that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued and practiſed, not as things inſtituted in their age, but as things, which had bene practiſed in all times in the Church, &amp; were come by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall and ſucceſſiue obſeruation
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23146:19"/>
from the Apoſtles vnto them; and that in the Authors of the precedent ages, no repugnant teſtimonie can be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but wholy to the contrary: when any occaſion of ſpeaking of thoſe things is offered, they alwaies affoard co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable and fauourable teſtimonies; which is in few words to ſay: That thing ought to be held in all reaſon for ancient, which thoſe, whome we do accompt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, did themſelues eſteeme to be ancient.</p>
            <p>The fifth obſeruation is, about the Vnanimity and vniforme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Fathers; which ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious ſpirits would haue to be vnderſtood only, when one and the ſelfe ſame thing is actually found in the writings of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; which is a moſt vniuſt and impertinent pretenſion. For, that any doctrine or obſeruation be truly held by the Fathers to be Vniuerſall and Catholike, it is not needfull
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23146:19"/>
that it be found in the writings of all the Fathers, when as many of them perhapps neuer treated of thoſe matters, and of whoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings ſome haue periſhed, and neuer come to our hands: but there are two other lawfull waies to aſſure and ſatisfy vs in this matter. The one, when the Fathers or greateſt eminencie in euery Countrey, do agree in the affirmation of one and the ſelf ſame doctrine or practiſe, and none of the others haue noted it, as diſſenting from the Church, nor haue written againſt it. In this ſort,<note place="margin">Contra <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> when <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> had cited againſt the <hi>Pelagians</hi> the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of an eleuen Fathers, emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in learning, and agreeing in the ſame points of doctrine, he thought he had ſufficiently produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them the beliefe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church: and when the Councell of <hi>Epheſus</hi> had produced ten Fathers of former ages, they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23146:20"/>
thought, they had ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the Church in the precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t tymes, againſt the doctrine of <hi>Neſtorius</hi>:<note place="margin">Cap 42<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> for that, as <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis</hi> noteth, they doubted not, but thoſe ten Fathers held &amp; belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſelf ſame, which all the reſt of their brethren did.</p>
            <p>The other way is, when the Fathers do ſpeake not as Doctours, but as witneſſes, of the vſe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Church in their ages, &amp; do not ſay; In my opinion, this ought thus to be belieued, or thus to be vnderſtood, or thus to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but the Church from one end of the world to the other, belieueth thus, or obſerueth this. For then we do not hold that, which they ſay, as a thing ſayd by them, but as ſayd by the vniuerſall Church: and principally in matters whereof they could not be ignorant, by reaſon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the condition of things, as in matters of fact, or in reſpect
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23146:20"/>
of the ſufficiencie of the perſons. And in this caſe we do not draw from their words, only a probable argument, as we do, when they ſpeake as particuler Doctours; but the argument we draw from hence, is an abſolute demonſtration.</p>
            <p>This therfore is to be held vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly for Vniuerſall &amp; Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, which the moſt eminent of the Fathers, that liued in the time of the foure firſt Councells, haue taught in diuers Countreys, and different parts of the world, and which none of the reſt haue impugned or noted, as diſagreing from the doctrine of the Church; or which the Fathers of theſe Councells haue witneſſed, to haue bene belieued and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the whole Church in their ages: and that ſhall vndoubtedly remayne as ancient and Apoſtolike, which the Fathers of thoſe ages haue teſtified to haue bene obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the whole Church, not as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:23146:21"/>
a thing newly begun in their time, but deſcended to them by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and immemorable ſucceſſion from former ages, or from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Tradition of the Apoſtles. For thoſe thinges hauing bene v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſally obſerued in the tyme of the foure firſt Councels, they could not be inſtituted, but by an vniuerſall authority. For in the Catholike Church was then exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerued the rule mentioned by <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis,</hi> to oppoſe V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſalitie againſt Particularitie. And therefore one doctrine or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of one particuler Prince, could neuer come to be the beliefe or cuſtome vniforme and vniuerſall throughout all parts of the world: eſpecially in ſuch ſort, as no one of the Fathers liuing neere the tyme of thoſe vniuerſall innouations, ſhould haue perceaued or noted; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was then vniuerſally obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the whole Church, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:23146:21"/>
be inſtituted by ſome vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Prince.</p>
            <p>For according to the opinion of your Miniſters, there were in thoſe ages but two principall and vniuerſall authorities; the one of the Apoſtles, and the other of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councells. For they will not admit, that the Sea Apoſtolike had at thoſe tymes any vniuerſall authoritie: and therefore, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhalbe found to haue bene v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſally and vniformly obſerued in the Church, in all Countreys &amp; Prouinces of the earth, in the tyme of the foure firſt Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and not to haue bene begun in that time, but to haue bene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly practiſed, that is, before there was any Generall Councell in the Church, muſt neceſſarily be a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Apoſtles, following thoſe rules of <hi>S. Auguſtine Epiſt.</hi> 18.
<q>Thoſe things, ſaith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we keep, not by writing, but by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:23146:22"/>
Tradition, which are obſerued through the whole world, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be receaued from the ordination and inſtitution either of the Apoſtles themſelues, or of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councells, whoſe authority is moſt profitable to the Church.</q> And in another place.<note place="margin">De Bapt. cont. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. lib. 4. c. 6.</note> 
               <q>That cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome alſo, which men looking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, could not find, that it was inſtituted by poſterity, was iuſtly belieued to haue bene inſtituted by the Apoſtles.</q>
And there are many other things, which would be long to repeat. And againe. <q>If any one in this do ſeeke diuine authority, although that which the vniuerſall Church obſerueth, and hath not bene inſtituted by Councells, but alwayes retayned; is iuſtly belieued not to haue bene deliuered by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but by Apoſtolicall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity &amp;c.</q>
Which rules of <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> if they haue place in thoſe things, which the Fathers, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23146:22"/>
in the tyme of the foure firſt Councells, do teſtifie, to haue bene obſerued in the Church before thoſe Councells; with how much more reaſon ought they to haue place in thoſe matters, which the ſame Fathers affirme, not in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but in expreſſe termes, to haue bene inſtituted, and ordained by the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Theſe fiue Obſeruations then thus made vpon the Premiſſes, to paſſe now to the Concluſion; I ſay, that ſo farre of it is, that your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to whome his Maieſty doth exteriourly adhere, doe hold the ſame thinges, which the ancient Fathers haue belieued and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as neceſſary to ſaluation, that in the ſolemne Seruice or Liturgie of the Church, which is the ſeale of Eccleſiaſticall Communion, the foure principall points, for which they haue ſeparated themſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, which are, the Reall Preſence
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23146:23"/>
of the body of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Offering of the Sacrifice of the Euchariſt; Prayer &amp; Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the dead; &amp; Prayer to Saints, the ancient Fathers haue vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally and vniformly belieued, held, and practiſed them all, as thinges neceſſary to ſaluation; although in different degrees of neceſſitie. So as if your Miniſters had liued in the time of the ancient Fathers, they muſt, as they haue now forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and renounced our ſolemnities and communion for theſe cauſes: ſo alſo haue then renounced the ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the ancient Fathers, and conſequently the title &amp; ſociety of the Catholike Church.</p>
            <p>I ſayd the Reall Preſence of the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament, not becauſe I thinke not to paſſe further, to affirme the ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conuerſion of the Sacrament into the body of Chriſt, but it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth for my purpoſe to ſay, the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23146:23"/>
Reall Preſence. For it is not preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particulerly the Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation of the Sacrament, but the Reall Preſence of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt in the Sacrament, on which is grounded the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this article, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it to ſaluation, to wit, the Communion and ſubſtantiall Vnion to the body of Chriſt; which <hi>Saint Cyrill</hi> calleth the knot of our Vnion with God. Neither is it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly and preciſely the Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, but the Reall Preſence, from whence thoſe two inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences do proceed, for which your Miniſters in this article haue ſeparated themſelues from our Communion; which are, the one, the adoration of the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament, whome they would haue to be ſought and adored only in heauen; and the other is, the pretended deſtruction of the Vnion of the body of Chriſt, by
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:23146:24"/>
being at one time in many places in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>I haue ſayd nothing of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which all the ancient Fathers haue held to be the Center and roote of Epiſcopall Vnitie, and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall communion. For that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, that You are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently conuerſant in antiquity, to know, that the moſt ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Councells, and Chriſtian Emperours haue perpetually giuen vnto her the Primacie and ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Authority in all Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall matters, and ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Religion: which is as much as the Church requireth, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed as a point of faith, by them that do returne to the Vnity ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that ſo this companie of the Faithfull may be diſcerned from the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and others of their Sect, who ſome ages ſince haue ſeparated themſelues from the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23146:24"/>
and miniſterious head of the Church.</p>
            <p>Theſe foure points therfore are the principall fountaines of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention: &amp; if about theſe we were of accord, it would be eaſy to agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the reſt. I ſay, that the Fathers, who liued in the time of the foure firſt Councells, haue all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> held &amp; practiſed, as neceſſary to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, albeit in different degrees of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to wit, the Reall Preſence of the body of Chriſt, &amp; the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sacrifice, as a meanes abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the whole body of the Church, and conditionally neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to euery one in particuler: Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Oblation for the dead, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie <hi>neceſsitate medij</hi> to them for whom they are offered, to help the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the prayers and Sacrifices of the Church, to deliuer from temporall paines after this life, thoſe who hauing ſinned after baptiſme, haue not done ſufficient pennance, nor
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:23146:25"/>
fully ſatisfied the iuſtice of All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: and they are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>neceſsitate praecepti,</hi> for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of Chriſtian charity &amp; piety, both to the Church, who maketh them, and to the Miniſters and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, by whom ſhe maketh them.</p>
            <p>And Praier to Saintes hath bene practiſed, as neceſſary to the body of the Church, and to the Miniſters, by whome ſhe maketh them: neceſſary, I ſay, <hi>neceſsitate praecepti,</hi> for the communion and commerce betweene the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant and Militant Church. And as for particuler men, than haue no office in the Church, but vſe their priuate deuotions, it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <hi>neceſsitate actus,</hi> but it is only profitable for the more eaſie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining pardon for their ſinnes, by making their recourſe in praier to them, that are allready in perfect and aſſured poſſeſſion of the grace and fauour of God: but to theſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23146:25"/>
and to all other it is neceſſary <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate approbationis,</hi> that is, they are bound not to contradict it, nor to condemne the vſe and doctrine of the Church in this point, nor to ſeparate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from the Church for this cauſe, vnder paine of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and to be held and eſteemed for Heretikes.</p>
            <p>Of all which things I do not for the preſent vndertake the proof, leaſt in place of a Letter I ſhould ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d you a booke, but I oblige my ſelf to performe it, whenſouer you ſhall require it: and to ſhew vnto you, both by the vniforme conſent of the Fathers, who flouriſhed in the time of the foure firſt Councells, and by the formes which they haue left vs in their writings, of the ancient ſeruice of the Catholike Church in their ages, vniuerſally and vniformely were held, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and practiſed through all the Prouinces and Countries of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:23146:26"/>
earth, theſe foure points, in the ſame ſenſe, and in the ſame forme, as they are vſed in our Liturgies and common Seruice, and not as Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations, which then had their beginning, but as things which the ſame Fathers affirme to haue bene belieued and practiſed by all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; and to haue come to them, by a neuer-interrupted ſucceſſion of the tradition or approbation of the Apoſtles. So as, no man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Communion of our Church vnder the pretext and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of any of theſe things, but they muſt alſo renounce the Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ancient Catholike Church, and conſequently the inheritance of ſaluation.</p>
            <p>And this I will doe by authors and teſtimonies of good ranke and marke, as you know I am curious not to vſe others, and with plaine and cleare anſweres to all obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, taken out of the Fathers of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:23146:26"/>
thoſe or former ages; which thing will be vnto me ſo much the more eaſy, forſomuch as the proofes, which we bring out of the Fathers, do containe in expreſſe tearmes the affirmatiue of what we ſay; whereas on the contrary, our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries ſhall neuer be able to find one paſſage, which doth in expreſſe tearmes containe the negatiue: but only by ſuch inferences, as in an equall and iuſt Tribunall deſerueth not ſo much as once the hearing. For who knoweth not, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon it is, to alleage the conſequences of paſſages, and thoſe alſo ill interpreted and vnderſtood, &amp; in whoſe inferences doth alwaies lye hidden ſome Paralogiſme and fallacie, againſt the expreſſe words, and the liuelie and actuall practice of the ſame Fathers, out of whom they are taken: and that this is a ready way to accuſe the Fathers of want of vnderſtanding and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:23146:27"/>
not to take them for iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and to ſubmit ones ſelfe to the obſeruation of that, which they haue belieued and practiſed.</p>
            <p>To this I will further adde when you ſhall deſire it, the preſent conformitie of all other Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Churches, in theſe foure poynts, with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of all thoſe which do yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to this day vnder their iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that is, of thoſe that doe remaine vnder the Patriarchall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> as the <hi>Grecians, Ruſsians, Muſcouites,</hi> and <hi>Aſians</hi> of the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſeparated from vs ſome eight hundred yeares ſince: of thoſe alſo which are vnder the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> as the <hi>Syrians, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamians,</hi> and others that are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eaſt: For thoſe that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Patriarch of <hi>Syria,</hi> as the <hi>Maronites,</hi> do ſtill perſeuere in the Communion of the Church of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:23146:27"/>
               <hi>Rome.</hi> Of thoſe alſo, which rely and depend of the Patriarch of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> as the naturall <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> whome they call <hi>Copthes,</hi> and the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> deuided from vs and the <hi>Grecians,</hi> more then eleuen hundred yeares agoe, euen from the laſt of the foure firſt Councells, that is, from the Councell of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi>; theſe do hold theſe foure ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and with greater iealouſie, if it were poſſible, then the <hi>Latins</hi> do; and particulerly that of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, in which they do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belieue the Tranſubſtantiation which the <hi>Grecians</hi> at this day doe call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but do alſo adore it with externall actions, full of much more humility, then ours are; which is a manifeſt ſigne, that theſe foure poynts were vniformely held and obſerued by the ancient Catholike Church; ſeeing that all the partes, into which the Catholike Church is deuided, retayne them to this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:23146:28"/>
preſent day with great vniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, notwithſtanding the diſtance, ſeparation, and diuiſion of them, through all Nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>Behould heere in generall, the cauſes, which moued me in my Letter, to vſe that exception obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vnto me in yours, which if his Maieſty of <hi>Great-Brittaine</hi> had as well the leaſure to conſider in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler, as he hath capacitie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them; I aſſure my ſelfe, he would not thinke it ſtrange, that I ſhould wiſh him the Title of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>: but would alſo wiſh and deſire it himſelf, and put himſelfe in ſtate to obtayne it both to himſelfe, and his: I meane, he would to his other Crownes adde alſo this, that he would become a Mediatour for the reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church which would be vnto him a more trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Glory, then that of all <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xanders,</hi> and <hi>Ceſars</hi>: and it would obtaine no leſſe honour to his Iland,

to haue bene the place of his birth, then to haue brought forth the Great <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the firſt deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and pacifier of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I beſeech the infinite goodnes of God, that he would vouchſafe one day to increaſe with this, the other graces, which he hath giuen him, and to graunt in this behalfe, the prayers of the happy deceaſed Queene his Mother, whoſe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teares, as did thoſe of <hi>S.
