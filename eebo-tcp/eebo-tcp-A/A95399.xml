         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Offered to the Honeſt and Faithful

            </head>
            <p>COnſider, Sirs, I beſeech you, that nothing can keep off Kingſhip, and prevent your and
our deſtruction through the prevailing power of a ſingle Perſon, aſſiſted by a diſaffected
Party in the Camp, City, Court and Country, but
<list>
                  <item>1. That you remember from whence you are fallen, and do your firſt works;
return and ſtand to, or fall with the <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> of God and your Countrey.</item>
                  <item>2. That without delay, you ſpeedily purge the Army of all ſelf-deſigners, (how
great ſoever) and introduce in their ſteads, ſuch as have faithfully ſerved and
ſuffered for what you fought.</item>
                  <item>3. Commit the Conduct of the Army to five or ſeven perſons who through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
your late Declenſions have ſtood untainted in their integrity.</item>
                  <item>4. Recal (for the proſecution of what is propoſed) that Parliament
who changed the Government from Kingly to a Commonwealth, and whom the
late Protector interrupted <hi>April</hi> 20, 1653.</item>
                  <item>5. Enter into a ſolemn Engagement with all your Civil and Chriſtian Friends, for
defence of your Country and its Cauſe, with the hazard of your Lives and Estates.</item>
                  <item>6. The Parliament once ſate, you may in a humble and petitionary way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
them with Propoſals, as 1. ſpeedy proviſion of pay for the Army: 2. Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Militia of City and Country in confiding hands: 3. Securing of
Gariſons and Cinque-Ports within the three Nations: and 4. that endeavours
may be uſed to beget a right understanding betwixt all their Forces by ſea &amp; land.</item>
                  <item>7. Conſider that heavy work is made light by active and orderly endeavours;
for ſecrecy and celerity are the wheels of the greateſt Actions.</item>
                  <item>8. Conſider that Treachery, when withstood, turns Coward; and when feared,
becomes the most cruel Tyrant.</item>
                  <item>9. Conſider that Court-Dyals are gazed on by all in the day, (or whilſt the Sun
ſhines) but by none in the night.</item>
                  <item>10. Fear them not whoſe courage is cowed by their Conſciences.</item>
                  <item>11. Be not dellatory, but active and industrious in doing your duties, and casting
off thoſe looſe corns, which will rather interrupt, then reform; and travail in your
<hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> without tyring; and let your Courage aſſist your Swords to
cut through all difficulties.</item>
                  <item>12. Conſider that if providence ſhould oppoſe you (as there is no ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it will) in this cauſe, yet by living or dying in its defence, you will have forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
your Memories againſt all events: for whilst you are your Countries Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
it will to eternitie remain your moſt memorable Monument.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now thus reſolved, fear no over-match in multitudes, where God (the great Maſter of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
whom you have often tryed in the mount of extremities) is on your ſide, he will turn your
enemies Arms into Legs, and their Heads into Heeles; however, it is better to dye of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
then the Diſeaſe.</p>
