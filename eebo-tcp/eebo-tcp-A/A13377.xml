            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The angels, madam, and not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, but the most beautifull of all the rest: for the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> is so far in loue with you, that the other night he appeared vnto me, and charged me to do his earnest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations vnto you, with promise, that if hee might be assured of your secrecie, he would at conuenient times visit you, and interteine you with such loue as befitteth such holy spirits.</p>
            <p>This tale so set a fire <hi>Lisetta,</hi> that she not onely than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Friar <hi>Onyon</hi> for his commendations; but counted her selfe the most fortunate of all women, that she was beloued of so blessed a Saint: &amp; therfore when and where it pleased him, he should be intertained with as honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable secrecie, as a poore dame of her calling might afford. Friar <hi>Onyon</hi> séeing this géere would worke, prosecuted his purpose then subtilly: he presently fell downe on his knées before hir, and desired, that for such happie newes as he had brought, she would graunt him a boone. <hi>Lisetta</hi> liberall now to performe any demaund, bad him aske. Then he began thus: Madam, quoth he, for that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell <hi>Gabriell</hi> is a spirit, and his brightnesse such, as no mortall eye can suffer, and therefore must come vnto you
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2591:10"/>
in some humane shape, I pray you vouchsafe, that my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die may be the receptacle for him, that while he putteth on my carcasse, my soule may enioy the sight and pleasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of paradise: so shall you not hinder your selfe, and do me an vnspeakeable benefit. <hi>Lisetta</hi> seeing Friar <hi>Ony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was a lusty tall fellow, willing in what she might, to pleasure him, graunted his request verie willinglie: wherevpon it was concluded, that she should leaue the doore open, and about midnight the Angel <hi>Gabriell</hi> should come to visit hir. Upon this resolution home went <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setta,</hi> as merry as a pie, tricking vp hir bedchamber with all brauerie, and rich perfumes for the interteinment of hir paramour. And, Friar <hi>Onyon,</hi> as busie as a bée, was making his winges and his trinckets ready to play the Angell: well, he delt so, that he agréed with an old pandor that dwelt opposite to the house, and there made himselfe ready, and at the houre appointed went to <hi>Lisetta:</hi> where he found the doore open, and so entred vp till hee came to her bedchamber; where she sat expecting his comming: assoone as she sawe him with his glorious wings and his white roabes, she rose, and fell at his féet: but he louingly tooke her vp, imbracst hir, kist her, and pointed to the bed, whether the Angell went after he had laid apart his abiliments, and <hi>Lisetta</hi> followed with as much spéed as might be: <hi>Caetera quis nescit.</hi> Early before breake of the day, <hi>Gabriell</hi> tooke his leaue of his <hi>Liset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and went to his lodging, leauing hir the proudest woman in the world, that shee was beloued of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell. Friar <hi>Onyon</hi> hee got him to his cell, and there tooke vppe his broaken sléepe hee had lost till nine of the clocke, that hee went into his Oratorie: where hee had not sytten long, but <hi>Lisetta</hi> in as great brauerie as might, came to the church, and then offerd vp in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deuotion a burning taper to the Angell <hi>Gabriell;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards hir orisons done she came to fryar <hi>Onyon,</hi> who after some conference demaunded hir of hir new louer,

and because they had mist of their purpose they departed, leauing <hi>Lisetta</hi> a sorrowfull woman, that she was so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the Angell <hi>Gabriell.</hi> Well night passed, and the morning came, &amp; this poore man friar <hi>Onyons</hi> hoast tould him, that he knew not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this seemed hard to the friar, yet of two euils the least was to be chosen, and he consented to suffer what the hoast would deuise. Wherevpon he that was of a pleasant conceipt vsed him thus: he annointed him ouer with barme mixed with hony, and stuck him full of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and tying him by the neck with a chaine, put a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor on his face, and on either side tide a great ban Dogge, in this <hi>come equipage</hi> marched this poore man with the Friar. He was no sooner come into the open streete, but the people hauing neuer seene such a sight before in <hi>Florence,</hi> did not onely wonder at the strangenesse of his dressing; but maruailed what this nouelty should meane: wherevpon an infinit number not onely of the common sort, but of the grauest citizens followed, to see what should be the end of this woonder.</p>

assigned to such sundry torments, as mans eye would almost surfet with the varietie of obiects, euen the very broome men were there for robbing of the broome closes betwéene Barking and London. And hard by them was there a place empty formed thus: It was made like the shape of Tiborne threesquare, and all painted about with halters, and hard by stood two tall fellowes with carters whips so stearnely looking, as if with euery lashe they would cut a man to the bones: there was written ouer the place a great romaine <hi>B.</hi> I could not learne for whom this torment was prouided, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> so many men, so many censures: some said it was for one <hi>Boniface</hi> which should be Pope, and should proue a great persecutor: others, that <hi>Bonner</hi> should be brought from his place among the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and be whipt there for bréeching of <hi>Bartlet Greene</hi> naked in his garden: but the most voyces went, that it was for <hi>Bul</hi> the hangma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because at his whipping in lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the carters shewed him too much fauour.

Hee which sits highest, ouer whose head thou séest is written, <hi>One</hi> and <hi>One,</hi> had a beautifull dame to his wife, faire and well featured; yet a great deale more full of beauty then of honesty: but howsoeuer qualified, a good wench shée was, and one that was not such a niggard but shée could kéepe a corner for a friend: to be brief, shée would beare a man false at tables, and hir husband that loued I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish well, thought it no ill tricke at tables to beare a man too many: he saw it and knew very well, that his wife lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued another as well as himselfe: yet hee loued hir so, that he woulde not discontent hir, but suffered hir to haue hir longing and to féede hir owne fancie, and like a wittold winkt at it, and therefore worthy to weare the horne. Thus while he liued the dishonour of his life was shame enough for his leudnes, &amp; nowe after his death because he was so kind a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they haue plast him there without any punishment, because it was penance enough to haue his conscience prickt with a restles sting of baudry. And here they haue made him a gentleman, and in his Scutchion haue giuen him the Ram rampant, with a mighty paire of hornes hanging ouer his eies: to signifie, if it be rightly emblasde, that he had such a great head, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> looking through his hornes he did sée and not see, shocking on with heauy palmes as belwether to the rest, his <hi>Motto</hi> is stolne out of <hi>Tully:</hi>
               <q>Non solum pro nobis.</q>
Meaning, that as we are not borne for our selues, but for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2591:14"/>
our Country, so he did not marry a wife for himselfe, but for his neighbours: this was the kinde opinion of this graue wittold.</p>
            <p>The second, ouer whose head is written, <hi>None</hi> &amp; <hi>One,</hi> was a man of an honest and vertuous disposition, who hauing a faire wife, that though shee coulde not treade right, yet wrincht hir shooe inward; that was as secret as shée was false; and though shée could not liue <hi>Caste</hi> yet shée liued <hi>Caute:</hi> he neuer suspected hir; but as he was honestly minded towards hir, and kept himselfe to the wife of his bosome, so measured hir foote after his owne last, and thought none in the world to haue a more chast wife, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indéed none had a more lasciuious wanton. This poore man was none in his owne conceit, yet was one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede: and therefore is he placst here without any torture: for that it is plague enough for him that hee had a whore to his wife. Hee is likewise made a gentleman and giues Armes the Goate, which by imblasure signifies, that as the Goate carries his hornes behinde, so hauing hornes because they were not apparant on his forehead, thought hee had none, and yet carried a faire paire backward like the Gote, his <hi>Motto</hi> is:
<q>Crede quod habes &amp; Habes.</q>
Meaning, that a mans content stands as his beléeuing is; so that if a man in his owne conscience thinkes he hath a faire wife, it sufficeth, what soeuer proofe makes mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to others.</p>
            <p>The third, ouer whose head is written, <hi>One</hi> and <hi>None,</hi> is a man that hath a woman of surpassing beauty to his wife, excellent and rare in properties, and euery way as vertuous in honest perfection, a woman as faire as <hi>Hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> and as chaste as <hi>Lucrece:</hi> yet forsooth, because his wife is more faire then the common sort, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more gazde on for that wheresoeuer shée goes, many mens eies wait vpon hir and diuers lasciuious youth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to frequent hir company; yet shée that is wholy

resolued vpon vertue hath the tortue is vnder hir féet and gads not abroad; but kéeping home auoids all occasions of dishonor: yet for al these manifest instances of hir honesty, the eie of hir husband fiered with suspition so inflames his hart with iealousie, as there is none looks on his wife, but he thinks he comes to court hir, &amp; shee glaunces hir ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He is as the rest are, made a gentleman, his arms the Asse, with a maruellous paire of long &amp; large eares. The emblason this, that as the Asse for the length of his eares thinks them to be hornes, &amp; yet indéed are but a plain paire of eares: so he like an Asse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath a faire wife, thinks that <hi>per Consequens</hi> he must be a Cuckold, when indeed he is none, and so suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his eares to be hornes: his <hi>Motto</hi> is,
<q>Ne mulieri credas, ne mortus quidem.</q>
Meaning, that what faire shewe soeuer a woman dooth heare of honestie, yet there is no credite to be giuen vnto hir coynesse: but hee resolues with the crue of the yellow hosde companions, that <hi>Mulier,</hi> howsoeuer it be spoken or vnderstoode, is a word of vnconstancie: therefore though he hath no hornes, because his wife is too honest, yet like an Asse for his Iealousie, hee shall haue a long paire of eares whiles he liues.</p>

Amongst the rest, the Church of Doncaster in Yorkeshire, desiring to be one of the formost, to signifie their obedience and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in all hast sent for the Painter to make them a roode, and agréed vpon the price. Wherevpon he went about his worke, but for that his hand had béene out of vse by the space of six yéeres, he had forgot the lineaments of the visage, and the other woonted proportion, that he made it very hard fauourde; yet as euery mans worke séemes well to himselfe, he went forward withall and set it vp on a satterday at night on the Roodloft: on sunday at masse there was old ringing of Bels, and old and yoong came to church to sée the new roode, which was so ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourde, that all the parish mislikt it, &amp; the children they cried and were afraid of it: vpon this they fell in greate displeasure with the painter, &amp; when monday came, and he was with the chéese of the parish for his money, they denyed flatly to pay him any, because his worke was so ill wrought.

As they were thus linked together in wedlocke, so it séemde in outward appearance that they were so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tied in affection, as no meanes might alienate. But women, whom nature hath framde to be inconstant, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be altred by nurture.

glances that foreshewed good will: Thus with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of fauours they liued. <hi>Pier</hi> séeking oportunity how to reueale his minde to <hi>Maria,</hi> at last as hee walked one day forth the towne, he saw where shee was walking on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with one of hir maides, taking therefore oportunity by the forehead he stept to hir, and beganne to court hir with sundry protestations of his loue, which had béen long and so surely set as no dispaire coulde race out, promising not onely to be a faithfull seruant in constancie: but to bee so carefull of hir honour as of his owne life: &amp; for your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, think Mistres quoth he, that faults in affections are fleight follics, that <hi>Venus</hi> hath shrines to shade hir trew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, &amp; <hi>Cupids</hi> wings are shelters for such as venter far to content their thoughts, vnseene is halfe pardoned, and loue requires not chastity, but that hir Souldiers be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Maria</hi> hearing the wag thus play the Orator, hauing loue in hir eies and desire in heart, after a fewe faint de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials, thrusting him away with the little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Grarde thus he grewe in such credite, that there was no man with <hi>Maria</hi> but <hi>Pier,</hi> hauing thus a loue beside hir husband, although hee was a faire man and well featured; yet shée found fault with him, because he was a meacocke and a milkesoppe, not daring to drawe his sworde to reuenge hir wrongs: wherefore shee resolued to entertaine some Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and so shée did: for one Signor <hi>Lamberto</hi> a braue Gentleman; but some thing harde facde, sought hir fauour and founde it, and him shée intertained for hir Champion.</p>
            <p>Thus had shée a white liuerd Adon to féede hir eie with beauty, and a stoute <hi>Hercules</hi> to reuenge all hir wrongs with his sworde, and a poore husband to shadowe both with his hornes.

where hee passed away many merry daies in such plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as Country sports can affoord: at last serious affairs forcing him to it, he rid his way for thrée or foure daies to certaine of his friends there adioining. <hi>Maria</hi> seeing hir husband gone thought not to let time slippe, nor to lose o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity: and therefore the next day after sent for <hi>Pier,</hi> who hasted as fast as might be, till he came to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres, where he had such friendly intertainement as fitted both their humours; shée caused hir maide to make great chéere, and assoone as it was ready, to dinner they went, where they were scarce set but one knocked at the doore, the maide looked out and it was Signor <hi>Lamberto,</hi> shée ran and told hir Mistres; who fearefull that he should sée <hi>Pier</hi> or know of him, hid him vnder the bed, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hir maide to bid Signor <hi>Lamberto</hi> come vp: shee like a cunning Curtizan giuing him such fauourable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement as though hee were the man whom aboue all other shée made account off.

What is the matter quoth the Master of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> house? he answerd nothing, but put vp his sword, tooke horse &amp; away towards <hi>Lions.</hi> Assoone as the gentleman came vp, he found his wife amazde, sitting in the hall in the middest of the flowre, as halfe beside hir selfe: what is the matter wife (quoth hée) that thou art so amazed, and that Signor <hi>Lamberto</hi> went downe with his sworde drawne in such a rage? Ah husband (quoth shée) as I sate héere at my worke, came running into the court yarde a proper young man hauing throwne away his Cloake and his Hatte, and desired mee, as I tendered the state of a man, to saue his life, for Signor <hi>Lamberto</hi> would kill him: I pittying his case stept in and hidde him in my bedchamber: with that came Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>Lamberto</hi> gallopping, dismounted in the court and drawing his sworde, came running vp and woulde haue broken open my chamber dore, but that on my knées I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to the contrary: at my request hee went his way, frowning as you sée, and so hee is rode to <hi>Lions:</hi> the poore young man (alas) husband lies hidde vnder the bed in great feare: and this tale shée tolde so lowde that <hi>Pier</hi> heard euery worde, and therefore had his lesson what hee should answere: smyling at the prompt witte of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres that had so sodaine a shift. Bidde him come out wife quoth he: then shée oapt the doore, and <hi>Pier</hi> he came as one greatly affrighted from vnder the bedde. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman séeing him a proper young man and weaponlesse, had pittie on him and saide: hee was glad that his house
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2591:25"/>
was a sanctuary for him, and greatly commended his wife that shée had saued him from the fury of Signor <hi>Lamberto,</hi> whom all <hi>Lions</hi> accounted a most desperate man: vpon this taking <hi>Pier</hi> by the hand they sate downe to dinner, and when they had taken their repast, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman very curteously conducted <hi>Pier</hi> home to <hi>Lions.</hi> Now for because shée was thus inconstant, shée to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hir pride and insolencie, sate in Purgatory with the punishment afore rehearsed.</p>

This Gentleman had one onely Daughter called <hi>Margaret,</hi> who for hir beauty was liked of all and desired of many; but neither might their sutes, nor hir owne eie preuaile about hir fathers resolution, who was determined not to marry hir, but to such a man as should be able in abundance to maintaine the excellencie of hir

The poore wench was bound to the stake, and had not onely an olde impotent man: but one that was so iealous, as none might enter into his house with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suspition, nor shée doe any thing without blame: the least glance, the smallest countenance, any smile was a manifest instance to him, that shée thought of others bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then himselfe: thus he himselfe liued in a hell and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his wife in as ill perpleritie. At last it chaunced, that a young Gentleman of the Citie comming by hir house, and seeing hir looke out at hir windowe, noting hir rare and excellent proportion, fell in loue with hir, and that so extreamely, as his passions had no meanes till hir fauour might mittigate his heartsicke discontent. The young man that was ignorant in amorous matters and had neuer béene vsed to Court anie Gentlewomen, thought to reueale his passions to some one friend, that might giue him counsaile for the winning of hir loue, and thinking experience was the surest Maister, on a day seeing the olde Doctour walking in the Churche that was <hi>Margarets</hi> husbande, little knowing who
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2591:26"/>
he was, he thought this the fittest man to whom he might discouer his passions, for that hee was olde and knewe much, and was a Phisition that with his drugges might helpe him forward in his purposes: so that séeing the olde man walke solitary hee ioind vnto him, and after a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>salute,</hi> tolde him that he was to impart a matter of great import vnto him; wherein if hee woulde not onely be secrete, but indeuour to pleasure him, his paines should bee euery way to the full considered. You must imagine gentleman, quoth <hi>Mutio,</hi> for so was the Doctors name, that men of our profession are no blabs, but hold their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets in their hearts bottome, and therfore reueale what you please, it shall not onely be concealed; but cured, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Art or counsail may do it. Upon this <hi>Lionel,</hi> so was the yong gentleman called, tolde and discourst vnto him from point to point howe he was fallen in loue with a gentlewoman that was maried to one of his profession, discouered hir dwelling and the house, and for that hee was vnacquainted with the woman, and a man little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in loue matters, he required his fauour to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him with his aduise. <hi>Mutio</hi> at this motion was stung to the heart, knowing it was his wife hee was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in loue withall: yet to conceale the matter and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience his wiues chastity, and that if shée plaid false he might be reuengde on them both; he dissembled the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and answered, that hee knewe the woman very well, and commended hir highly; but said, shée had a Churle to hir husband: and therefore he thought shée woulde bee the more tractable: trie hir man quoth hee, saint heart neuer woonne faire Ladie: and if shée will not be brought to the bent of your bowe, I will prouide such a potion as shall dispatch all to your owne content, and to giue you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther instructions for oportunitie, know that hir husband is forth euery after noone from thrée till sixe.

The yoong Gentleman not onely promised al carefull secrecie, but gaue him har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thanks for his good counsell, promising to méete him there the next day, and tell him what newes. Then hee left the old man, who was almost mad for feare his wife any way should play false: he saw by experience, braue men came to besiege the castle, and séeing it was in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans custodie and had so weake a gouernor as himselfe, he doubted it would in time be deliuered vp, which feare made him almost frantike: yet he driude of the time in great torment, til he might heare from his riual. <hi>Lionel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> he hasts him home and sutes him in his brauery, and goes downe towards the house of <hi>Mutio,</hi> where he sées hir at the window, whome he courted with a passionate looke with such an humble <hi>salute,</hi> as she might perceiue how the Gentleman was affectionate. <hi>Margareta</hi> looking earnestly vpon him, and noting the perfection of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, accompted him in hir eye the flower of all <hi>Pisa,</hi> thinkte hir selfe fortunate, if she might haue him for hir fréend, to supply those defaults that she found in <hi>Mutio:</hi> sundry times that afternoone he past by hir window, and he cast not vp more louing lookes then he receiued gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious fauoures: which did so incourage him, that the next day betwéene thrée and sixe hee went to hir house, and knocking at the doore, desired to speake with the Mistres of the house, who hearing by hir maids description, what he was, commaunded him to come in, where she intertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with all curtesie.</p>
            <p>The youth that neuer before had giuen the attempt to court a Ladie, began his <hi>exordium</hi> with a blush: and yet went forward so well, that hee discourst <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2591:27"/>
ready to prise hir discontent with his bloude at all times.</p>
            <p>The Gentlewoman was a little coye, but before they past they concluded, that the next day at foure of the clock he should come thither and eate a pounde of cheries, which was resolued on with a <hi>succado des labres,</hi> and so with a loath to depart they tooke their leaues. <hi>Lionello</hi> as ioyfull a man as might be, hyed him to the church to méete his ould Doctor, where he found him in his ould walke: what newes syr quoth <hi>Mutio?</hi> how haue you sped? Euen as I can wish quoth <hi>Lionello.</hi> For I haue béene with my Mistresse, and haue found hir so tractable, that I hope to make the ould peasaunt hir husband looke broad headed by a paire of browantlers. How déepe this stroake into <hi>Mutios</hi> heart, let them imagine that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture what ielousie is; in so much that the ould Doctor askt when should be the time: marry quoth <hi>Lionello,</hi> to morrow at foure of the clock in the afternoone, and then Maister Doctor quoth hee; will I dub the ould Squire knight of the forked order.</p>
            <p>Thus they past on in chat till it grew late, and then <hi>Lionello</hi> went home to his lodging, and <hi>Mutio</hi> to his house, couering all his sorrowes with a merry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, with full resolution to reuenge them both the next day with extremitie. He past the night as patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye as he could, and the next day after dinner away he went, watching when it should bee foure of the clocke, at the houre iust came <hi>Lionello,</hi> and was intertained with all curtesie: but scarce had they kist, ere the maide cryed out to hir Mistresse that hir Maister was at the doore: for he hasted, knowing that a horne was but a little while on grafting: <hi>Margaret</hi> at this alarum was amazed, and yet for a shift <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Well the next day he went againe to méete his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whome hee found in his woonted walke; what newes quoth <hi>Mutio?</hi> how haue you sped? A pox of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But it is no matter, twas but a chaunce, and I hope to crie quittance with him ere it be long: as how quoth <hi>Mutio?</hi> Marry thus, quoth <hi>Lionello:</hi> she sent me worde by hir Maide this day, that vpon thursday next the oulde Churle suppeth with a patient of his a mile out of <hi>Pisa,</hi> and then I feare not but to quitte him for all: It is well quoth <hi>Mutio:</hi> Fortune bee your fréend: I thanke you quoth <hi>Lionello,</hi> and so after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more prattle they departed.</p>

out againe, my maister comes: the good wife that before had prouided for afterclaps; had found out a priuie place betweene two seelings of a plauncher, and there she thrust <hi>Lionello;</hi> &amp; hir husband came sweting, what news, quoth she, driues you home againe so soone husband? Marrye swéete wife quoth he, a fearefull dreame that I had this night which came to my remembrance, &amp; that was this: me thought there was a villeine that came secretly into my house with a naked poinard in his hand, and hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: but I could not find the place, with that mine nose bled, and I came backe; and by the grace of God I will séeke euery corner in the house for the quiet of my minde. Marry I pray you doo husband, quoth she: with that he lockt in all the doores, and began to search euery chamber, euery hole, euery chest, euery tub, the very well, he stabd euery fetherbed through, and made hauock like a mad man, which made him thinke all was in vaine, and he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to blame his eies that thought they saw that which they did not: vpon this he rest halfe lunatike, &amp; all night he was very wakefull, that towards the morning he fell into a dead sleepe, and then was <hi>Lionello</hi> conueighed away.</p>
            <p>In the morning when <hi>Mutio</hi> wakened, hee thought how by no meanes hee should be able to take <hi>Lionello</hi> tardy; yet he laid in his head a most dangerous plot, and that was this: Wife quoth he, I must the next munday ride to <hi>Vycensa</hi> to visit an ould patient of mine, till my returne, which will be some tendayes, I will haue that stay at our little graunge house in the countrey: marry very well content husband, quoth she: with that he kist hir, and was very pleasant, as though he had suspected nothing, and away he flings to the Church: where hee móetes <hi>Lionello:</hi> what sir quoth he what newes, is your mistresse yours in possession? no, a plague of the old slaue quoth he; I thinke he is either a witch or els workes by Magick: for I can no sooner enter in the doores but he is
