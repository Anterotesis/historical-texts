            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT Of the Late <hi>Dreadful Earthquake</hi> IN THE Iſland of SICILY.</head>
            <p>THE late Earthquake that fell out in <hi>Sicily</hi> is of ſo aſtoniſhing a Nature, as can be eaſilier imagined, than expreſt; and ſuch a one as can hardly, if at all, be parallel'd in any preceding Age. It's true, that Iſland has been often the Scene of ſuch kind of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies, and the Irruptions of Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> have been no news in the World for near two thouſand years paſt: But whether as an effect of the Anger of Heaven, or of the Crazineſs of this Globe of the Earth, which ſeems to begn to yield to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96012:5"/>
Injuries of Time, as all other things do; certain it is, That this laſt Earthquake, for the ſuddenneſs of it, and the mighty Deſolations it has produced, is the moſt aſtoniſhing one that ever was.</p>
            <p>Philoſophers will be inclinable to ſearch for the natural Cauſes of ſuch a <hi>Phoenomenon,</hi> in the Quality and Temper of the Summer that went before: And I am willing ſo far to humour them, as to ſuppoſe, That the many great Rains and intenſe Heats ſucceeding ſo often one another this laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in all the Southern parts of <hi>Sicily,</hi> might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to this affrightful Irruption: For the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable <hi>Caſma's</hi> thereby made into the Bowels of the Earth, might probably give room for the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of the Atmoſphere to inſinuate themſelves into thoſe Subterraneous Cavities, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dilating themſelves, and requiring greater room, muſt needs force their way through all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles that pent them in.</p>
            <p>But leaving this Diſquiſition to others; It would ſeem this Earthquake carried along with it ſome more than ordinary Marks of an immediate ſtroke of Heaven. And as ſeldom the Divine Vengeance exerts its power upon us Mortals in any National Calamity, without giving us ſome previous Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſo this late Stroke was uſhered in with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted Preſages, of which it were hard, if not impoſſible, to give any natural Cauſe, though perhaps
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96012:5"/>
I be as little a Votary to Superſtition as any man can be, notwithſtanding the World is pleas'd to tax our Order with it; yet the ſtrangeneſs of one or two Omens that preceded this Earthquake, may juſtly prevail with me to give here a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them.</p>
            <p>Paſſing over that mighty loud Warning from Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> that happened for three days together in <hi>June</hi> laſt, which is always remark'd as a Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of ſome Irruption, either of the <hi>Mount</hi> it ſelf, or of ſome part thereabouts; This following ſtrange <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> fell out at <hi>Siracuſa</hi> on the 15<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> before.</p>
            <p>About two hours before Sun-ſetting, the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere being very clear, the Heavens appear'd on a ſudden all on fire, without any flaſhes of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the leaſt noiſe of Thunder, which laſted about a Quarter of an hour. About which time was ſeen in the Air, as it were perpendicularly above the City, two Rainbows, after the uſual manner, with points towards the Earth, and a third ranvers'd; the Colours of all three being extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bright. This was by all Spectators thought the more Supernatural, that during the whole time theſe Rainbows appear'd, there was not one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Cloud to be ſeen in any part of the Horizon.</p>
            <p>In <hi>July</hi> thereafter, at <hi>Catanea,</hi> the neareſt Town to <hi>Mount Aetna,</hi> there fell out another as ſurpriſing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96012:6"/>
Preſage. In the Church of the <hi>Minimes</hi> there, one Father <hi>Baletti</hi> lies buried; a man who was believed by the People of that Country to have by his Prayers ſtopt the progreſs of that fearful Irruption of <hi>Aetna</hi> which happened about a hundred and twenty years ago. The Story goes, That a Flood of Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menous Matter, like burning Oil, being thrown out of the Mountain, was carried down with a mighty rapidity to the very Gates of <hi>Catanea,</hi> bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing before it in its way. Every body expected to be immediatly devoured by this Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Innundation, when this Holy man by his Exorciſms and Prayers, in preſence of all the People, put a ſtop to its Careir. Now this Tomb being ever ſince held in greateſt veneration by the People of <hi>Catanea,</hi> and notwithſtanding his Name was never in the Calender, yet daily Prayers and Offerings ceas'd not to be offered at his Shrine. It fell out, as I have ſaid, in <hi>July</hi> laſt, That one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when the Doors of the Church came to be opened, the Statue of the Saint that was placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Monument, was fallen down, and lay flat on the ground. This was at firſt thought to be but an ordinary Accident; but the Statue, every time it was ſet up upon its Baſis again, for ſeven or eight nights together was conſtantly ſound fallen down to the ground in the morning, and at laſt was forced to be laid flat upon the Tomb, in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96012:6"/>
which poſture it lay till this late Deſtruction both of it, and the Town it ſelf.</p>
            <p>A third Preſage that ſeem'd to foretel this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, happen'd in a little Village within Three Miles from <hi>Catanea,</hi> named <hi>Alari,</hi> where uſed to grow as good Wine as any in <hi>Sicily.</hi> In <hi>February</hi> laſt about Sun-ſetting, all the People of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey about, ſaw, as they thought, this Village all in Flames. The Fire they imagined began from leſs to more, increaſing for about a quarter of an Hour together, and then all the Houſes of the Villages appear'd as in one Flame, which laſted for about Six minutes, till it ſeem'd to decay for want of more Fuel. A great many People that liv'd near the Village, when they ſaw the Fire firſt begin, came running to it; to do the Friendly office of helping to extinguiſh the Fire; and all along the Road, till they were almoſt within the very Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage it ſelf, they imagined they ſaw the Fire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ſelf more and more; but being entred, they found all was a deception of the ſight, if not a Preſage of that Calamity that ſome Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter befel the Place.</p>
            <p>But I come to the dreadful Earthquake it ſelf, a greater than which we read not of in either An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or Modern Hiſtory. It's here indeed that I can neither give my ſelf nor others the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I could wiſh, there being ſo many little Places,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96012:7"/>
and even ſome conſiderable Towns deſtroy'd, where there is no Inhabitants left to give us an Account of the manner theſe Places were ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up. So that of theſe we can have no other Narrative, but what People at a diſtance, and in a hurry themſelves for fear of ſinking into the ſame Ruin, have been able to give us.</p>
            <p>This Earthquake diffus'd it ſelf into all theſe three diſtricts or diviſions into which the Iſland of <hi>Sicily</hi> is ordinarily divided, which are, 1. <hi>Valli di Noto,</hi> comprehending principally the Eaſtern parts of the Iſland. 2. <hi>Mazaro,</hi> containing the Weſtern, and Southern Parts; And 3. <hi>Mono,</hi> which confines it ſelf to the North and North-Eaſt Parts of the Iſland. The greateſt ſhaking reach'd from <hi>Mount Aetna,</hi> all along to <hi>Cape Paſſaro,</hi> the <hi>Pachmus</hi> of the Ancients. In all this vaſt Tract of Land, nothing ſtood the ſhock, but all fell under the weight of a general Ruin.</p>
            <p>It was on the 7<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1693. about Ten at Night, that <hi>Mount Aetna</hi> began to utter thoſe hideous Roarings, which ſeldom but uſher in ſome Tragedy of the Nature of what followed. Thoſe loud Bellowings continued till the 9<hi>th.</hi> when about Twelve a Clock they began to ceaſe, or rather fall lower. Within an Hour after, the Inhabitants of <hi>Catanea,</hi> which was the next Town to the Mountain, began to perceive a ſhaking
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96012:7"/>
under them about three Minutes together. This did little other hurt than affright the people, and give them fears of ſome further hurt. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that during the three Minutes this ſhake continued, and an Hour before, there was not the leaſt noiſe heard from <hi>Mount Aetna.</hi> But within leſs than a Minute after the ſhake was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, not only did the noiſe redouble infinitely more terrible than it had been before; but the whole Top of the Mountain appear'd all in Flames, which the Wind blowing from the Weſtward, carried with it a vaſt quantity of Burnt Aſhes, which have always been found to be the ordinary attendants of thoſe Flamy Irruptions. It is not certain how far this ſhake of the 9<hi>th.</hi> diffus'd it ſelf; but 'tis probable that more or leſs of it was felt through moſt of the South Parts of this Iſland. For the Inhabitants of the Cities of <hi>Mineo, Palaonia, Ragoſa,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Licodia,</hi> felt all of them the fame ſhake, and at the ſame very Minute of the day as <hi>Catanea</hi> had done.</p>
            <p>All this was but the Forerunner of the horrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhake of all, which fell out on the 11<hi>th.</hi> This affected the whole Iſland, but very unequally. And by the exacteſt computation can be made, the whole period of it laſted not above Six Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, from <hi>Meſſina</hi> Northwards, to <hi>Cape Coio,</hi> the fartheſt point of <hi>Sicily</hi> to the South.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:96012:8"/>
               <hi>Catanea</hi> is thought to have been the firſt that fell under the weight of this heavy Calamity. This City is as Ancient as moſt in <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſeated in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and rich Soil, inhabited by ſeveral of the Gentry thereabouts, endowed with an Univerſity, and containing about Twenty Four Thouſand Souls, was ſunk out of ſight in a Moment. There happen'd ſome Fiſher-boats to be at that time in the Bay that lyes South of the Town, and within a Leagues diſtance, who give an Account, That they ſaw the City ſink down with the noiſe as it were of ſome Thouſand Pieces of Great Ordnance diſcharged all at once. After it was thus vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their ſight, the Fiſhermen ſay, That ſome Minutes thereafter, to the Eaſtward, near where the City ſtood, there roſe up a little Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which lifting it ſelf up ſeveral times a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable heighth, above the ordinary level of the ground thereabout, ſunk at laſt likewiſe out of their ſight. The Fiſhermen do likewiſe declare; That during all this horrid Tragedy, which they ſaw beſal the City <hi>Catanea,</hi> they themſelves were every Moment expecting to be ſwallowed up in the Bay, by reaſon of the ſtrange violent Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Sea; and ſcarce was this heaving up of the imaginary Mountain on the Southſide of <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi> over, but they felt the Sea Calm. It's thought there has not eſcaped of the Inhabitants of <hi>Catanea,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:96012:8"/>
above Two Thouſand of all. Thoſe that eſcap'd, came away either after the ſhaking of the 9<hi>th.</hi> or the Morning of the 11<hi>th.</hi> And the hideous roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Mount Aetna,</hi> which uſes to be the Forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſome Calamity on that ſide, gave them warning to flee. But they were the better ſort of People only, that had the opportunity to make ſo happy an eſcape, the reſt falling under the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Ruin. In the place where <hi>Catanea</hi> ſtood, appears now at a diſtance a great Lake, with ſome great heaps of Rubbiſh appearing here and there above the Water.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot one Circumſtance very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, which the Fiſhermen that were in the Bay of <hi>Catanea</hi> at the time of this laſt ſhake, do poſitively affirm; they ſay, That both before and ſome Minutes after the Earthquake happened, <hi>Mount Aetna</hi> appear'd more than ever in Flames, and the noiſe was greater than it had been ſince its firſt Irruption of the 7<hi>th.</hi> But a few Minutes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Catanea</hi> was ſwallowed up, there was neither Flames to be ſeen, nor the leaſt noiſe to be heard for the ſpace of Five or Six Hours together. And then the Mountain began of new again to roar and throw out Flames more duskiſh and ſmoaky than at any time before.</p>
            <p>The ſame ſhake that utterly deſtroyed <hi>Catanea,</hi> did lay in heaps more than the half of <hi>Saragoſa,</hi>

the Ancient <hi>Syracuſa.</hi> This City, once the greateſt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and if we will believe ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hiſtorians, particularly <hi>Strabo,</hi> the largeſt once in the World, may contend with any in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> for Antiquity, having been the Seat for a great many Ages of a flouriſhing Commonwealth, and the Scene of a great many Warlike Actions. It retain'd ſtill ſome marks of its Ancient Greatneſs, and with the Advantages of a Rich Soil, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Scituation, and a ſtrong Caſtle to defend it, might contain about 16000 People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient City ſuffered much by the ſhake of the 9<hi>th.</hi> moſt of the beſt Buildings, and the greateſt part of the Caſtle being rent in ſeveral places. Upon the 10<hi>th.</hi> at Night, it underwent another conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhake with a mighty Tempeſt of Wind, ſo that the great Bell in one of its Churches was heard ſeveral times to make a ſound, through the violent trembling of the Steeple. A great many were kill'd by the fall of Houſes the time this ſhake and Tempeſt happened; and moſt that were able, or had the opportunity, fled out of Town that Night, which was the occaſion of their Safety.</p>
            <p>But the ſhake of the 11<hi>th.</hi> brought with it a ſudden and inevitable Deſtruction, throwing down in a Moment more than two parts of three of the whole City, and burying in its Rubbiſh
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96012:9"/>
above four parts of five of the People that were left. The leaſt Computation that can be made of the loſs of the Inhabitants of it, is above 7000, the reſt eſcaping, as I have ſaid, the Night before, and ſome Hundreds were dig'd out of the Ruins alive, but lame and bruis'd, ſo that few of them, its thought, will recover. Moſt of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and People of beſt Faſhion ran into the great Church for ſhelter, where they met with Death by the fall of the Stone Roof and the Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple both together.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Noto</hi> had yet a worſe Fate than <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> ſcarce any part of it now ſtanding. This Place is one of the Ancienteſt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and once contended for the preheminence with <hi>Syracuſa</hi> it ſelf. It is ſcituate on a very high Rock, almoſt inacceſſable on all ſides, but by one narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; having under the <hi>Cape Paſſan</hi> one of the beſt and largeſt Harbours in the whole Iſland, and being indeed the Key of <hi>Sicily</hi> on that ſide. The mighty hardneſs of the Rock on which <hi>Noto</hi> ſtood, ſeem'd to ſecure it from the hazard of Earthquakes, but it felt that ſhake of the 9<hi>th.</hi> with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence than any other place of the Iſland. That of the 11<hi>th.</hi> laid it in a Moment in heaps, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner whereof we cannot attain, by reaſon none of the Inhabitants are left, but ſome few that left the Place on the 9<hi>th.</hi> There is ſeen yet ſtanding a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96012:10"/>
part of the Church of a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monaſtery, and ſcarce any more of the whole Town; the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants being computed about Seven Thouſand Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſta,</hi> a City well ſcituated, having a large Proſpect into the Sea, and adorned with very large and ſafe Harbours, a place of good Trade for Corn: This Place ſuffer'd conſiderably by the ſhake of the 9<hi>th.</hi> many of the Inhabitants, to the number of about 600. were bruis'd to Death with the fall of the Houſes. On the 10<hi>th.</hi> there was another ſhake, which obliged moſt of the People of Note to betake themſelves to the Caſtle for their Security, which prov'd as unlucky to them as the great Church had been to them of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſa;</hi> for there happening great flaſhes of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which ſeem'd to ſet the whole Heavens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, one of them fell on the Magazine of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der kept there, and blew up the Caſtle and all the People within, amounting to about 1100. The ſhake on the 11<hi>th.</hi> put an end to the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe,</hi> by overturning the Town, and burying the reſt of the Inhabitants in it; ſo that there ſcarce remains any thing of the Ancient <hi>Auguſta,</hi> but the Name. The Inhabitants were reckoned near 6000, of whom we have Account of none left.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:96012:10"/>
               <hi>Lentini,</hi> the Ancient <hi>Leontium,</hi> famous for the beautiful Lake on which it ſtood, a place of about 3000 Families, and a place of tolerable Trade by Fiſhing and Salt Mines, underwent the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of its Neighbour, and ancient Rival, <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa.</hi> The ſhake of the 11<hi>th</hi> reduc'd it to Aſhes, and its not known if any of the Inhabitants be ſaved. There is now to be ſeen ſeveral great heaps of Earth in the Lake, where there was none before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the Peaſants, who live on the other ſide op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the place where <hi>Lentini</hi> ſtood, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, That ſince this Earthquake, the Lake which was formerly clear and Limpid, and wonderfully ſtor'd with all variety of Fiſh, is now become brackiſh, and of a ſalt and bitumenous taſte, and vaſt number of Fiſh are found every day dead upon the Shore.</p>
            <p>Some better Fate had <hi>Calatgirone,</hi> a pretty Town, containing above 7000 People, and well built, moſt of hewn Stone. The ſhake of the 9<hi>th</hi> was very little perceptible there; and that of the 11<hi>th</hi> was much leſs than any where within ſome miles of it. It was not ſo little, but that it overturn'd about the 5<hi>th</hi> part of the Town, and two Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and is thought, deſtroy'd in all no fewer than 2000 Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Minco</hi> felt both the ſhakes of the 9<hi>th</hi> and 11<hi>th,</hi> and there ſeem'd but little difference betwixt the violence
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96012:11"/>
of either, or the damage each did. At both times ſeveral Houſes, and a pretty large Church, was overturn'd, and its thought near 4000 of the Inhabitants are periſhed. It was remarkable, That the time of the ſhake of the 9<hi>th,</hi> the Heavens about this Town were very ſerene, ſcarce a Cloud appearing above the Horizon: But that of the 11<hi>th</hi> was attended with a mighty ſtorm of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Lightning and Hail, which laſted above ſix hours together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monreal,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Morreal,</hi> received ſome damage in its buildings, and ſome few of the Inhabitants periſhed by their fall. The ſhake of the 11<hi>th</hi> did greatly ſhatter the Cathedral Church, which is indeed one of the beautiful Structures in the World. The <hi>Dome,</hi> which ſtands above the High Altar, fell, and cruſh'd in pieces four curious Pillars of Braſs, with ſeveral Statues of Saints of as good Workmanſhip as any in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom. Neither was the Archbiſhop's Palace free, it being ſet on fire by Lightning, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of it burnt down.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Palermo,</hi> the Seat of the Viceroy, felt little or nothing of the ſhake of the 9<hi>th,</hi> though ſeveral ſmall ſhakings they had had ſome days before. But that of the 11<hi>th</hi> was almoſt as terrible as in any other place, except <hi>Catanea, Syracuſa</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta.</hi> A great many Houſes were ſhattered, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96012:11"/>
ſome fell to the ground. The Cathedral ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered extremely in its Roof, and a Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Carmelite</hi> Monaſtery, was totally deſtroy'd. The Vice-Roy, with all his Family, and the Archbiſhop, retir'd aboard the Galleys in the Harbour, where by the violent motion of the Water they expected every moment to be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up. Some part of the great Mole built of Stone, that ſecures the Port, being ſhattered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few foot of their Gally. It's ſaid, there were not above 100 people in all kill'd at <hi>Palermo,</hi> and thoſe moſtly that liv'd in a Subburb built of Wood.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Paſceni</hi> it's not known whether the ſhake of the 9<hi>th</hi> or 11<hi>th</hi> deſtroyed it. It was a pretty place, conſiſting of about two hundred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and thoſe thought the richeſt of any little Town of <hi>Sicily,</hi> by reaſon of the goodneſs of its Wine and Silk exported thence to the Sea in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quantitites. Now there is not one ſingle Houſe left ſtanding, nor one ſingle perſon ſav'd. A new Lake takes up now that ſpacious Valley on the Eaſt-ſide of the Town, which was all hitherto covered with the beſt of Vines; and the Water thereof is of a brackiſh colour, and a bitumenous taſte.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Patuzolo,</hi> a bigger place than <hi>Paſceni,</hi> though not ſo happily ſcituated, nor ſo rich, fell under the ſame Fate with it. None of the Inhabitants, for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96012:12"/>
any thing is yet known, were ſav'd, the number of which might probably amount to about 1000 people at leaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Furla,</hi> a Town about the bigneſs of <hi>Paſceni,</hi> and ſeated on a riſing Hill amidſt Quarries of Stone, much of the nature of Marble, was nothing more fortunate, we having no other account of its Ruin, but what thoſe that ſaw it at a diſtance could give. It may be worthy of Remark, That in ſeveral parts of the Mountain about <hi>Furla,</hi> the Rocks, which formerly were almoſt as white as <hi>Genoa</hi> Marble, in the chinks that the Earthquake made among them, the Stones are now of a burnt Colour, as if Fire and Powder had been us'd to rent them aſunder. The Fountains of Freſh water wherewith theſe Mountains do abound, have loſt their clearneſs, and have both a ſulphurous ſmell and taſte. The Inhabitants of <hi>Furla</hi> were reckoned to be near a thouſand Souls.</p>
            <p>A Town much greater than any of the three laſt, <hi>Sciorti,</hi> ſcituated in a pleaſant Valley, and a rich Soyl, where the beſt Rock-ſalt is digg'd, was likewiſe totally demoliſh'd by the ſhake of the 11<hi>th,</hi> and now nothing but vaſt heaps of Rubbiſh, and which is ſtrange, a Church belonging to a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Nunnery, yet intire, are to be ſeen, where <hi>Sciorti</hi> once ſtood: We know of none of the Inhabitants that have ſav'd themſelves from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96012:12"/>
this Calamity, and they are reckoned to amount to two thouſand Souls.</p>
            <p>The ſame Fate befel <hi>Militello,</hi> no inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Town, whereof the Inhabitants were eſteemed pretty rich, by the means of one of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Manufacturies of Silk that was in <hi>Sicily.</hi> It's probable this place was deſtroy'd before the ſhake of the 11<hi>th;</hi> for the Countrey-people, who dwell on the Neighbouring Ridge of Mountains, do affirm, that it was not to be ſeen upon the 11<hi>th</hi> in the Morning: But at what preciſe time it was ſwallowed up, they cannot tell, being that for three days before, they could not ſee ſo far as <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litello,</hi> by reaſon of a thick Fog which continued from Twelve a Clock of the 8<hi>th</hi> day, till the Morning of the 11<hi>th.</hi> It's ſcarce to be imagined what a ſurpriſing Change this place has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone. For a conſiderable part of the Mountain that lay on the North-ſide of the Town, has been, through the violence of the Earthquake, torn aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the one half has overwhelm'd the Town: There being a vaſt <hi>Chaſma</hi> now to be ſeen betwixt it, and the other part of the Mountain that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd ſtill in its firſt poſture: <hi>Militello</hi> might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably contain about 6000 people, whereof no one is left to give Tidings how its Calamity came about.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:96012:13"/>
               <hi>Luochela</hi> had not altogether ſo bad a Fate as the former. This place felt the ſhake of the 9<hi>th</hi> very ſeverely; inſomuch that a great part of the Houſes fell by it. The Inhabitants over and above this, and ſome former ſhakes, had another Prognoſtick of the Ruin that was coming on the place, which influenced a conſiderable number of them to leave the Town upon the 9<hi>th</hi> at night. There was an old Caſtle, which ſtood upon a riſing ground, ſome two miles from <hi>Luochela,</hi> ſaid to have been built by the <hi>Romans</hi> in the time of the <hi>Punick</hi> War. This Caſtle was, in the view of the People of <hi>Luochela,</hi> ſwallowed up in a moment, and no remaining Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtige was to be ſeen where it ſtood; but inſtead thereof, there guſh'd up a prodigious quantity of Waters, which in a few hours made up a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Lake where the Caſtle had ſtood. So that it is to the affirightful view of this Caſtle's being overturn'd, that more than the half of the People of the Town owe their ſafety, as having fled the Town upon ſight thereof. The reſt of the Town and Inhabitants were utterly deſtroy'd on the 11<hi>th;</hi> and now there remains nothing but vaſt heaps of Rubbiſh where the Town formerly ſtood. <hi>Luo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chela</hi> might probably contain two thouſand peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whereof near the half are deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Palonia,</hi> a very pretty little Town, very well built, and endowed with one of the beautifulleſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96012:13"/>
Churches in the whole Iſland, felt ſeveral ſhakes, of which thoſe of the 9<hi>th</hi> and 11<hi>th</hi> were the moſt terrible. The Church was ſhattered in a thouſand places; and the <hi>Dome</hi> was on the 11<hi>th</hi> thrown down, which broke the High Altar to pieces, and cruſh'd to death ſome 300 people, with the Prieſt that was ſaying Maſs. There was little other damage done in <hi>Palonia;</hi> moſt of the People ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving betaken themſelves to the Fields, upon the Accident that befel the <hi>Dome</hi> of the Church. So that the loſs has not been ſo great, neither in the fall of Houſes, nor death of people, in <hi>Palonia,</hi> as it was in moſt other Towns about it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buchino,</hi> a conſiderable Village, eſcaped very near as well as the Town of <hi>Palonia,</hi> moſt of the Houſes being thrown down, but ſcarce any of the people kill'd, though ſome much bruiſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scodia,</hi> a Burgh about the bigneſs of the other, was greatly ſhaken on the 11<hi>th,</hi> and about 150 people kill'd by the fall of the Church in the time of Maſs. Within a mile of this Village there was a Lake about two miles about, and very deep. The ſhake of the 9<hi>th</hi> was ſeen clearly to occaſion the leſſening of the Water of the Lake, ſo that it was dry for ſome paces round the Banks. But ſo ſtrange was the effect of the ſhake of the 11<hi>th</hi> upon this Lake, that near the midſt of it there opened a large <hi>Caſma,</hi> which ſwallowed up all the remaining
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96012:14"/>
Water, and left the whole Channel dry Land, which continues ſo.</p>
            <p>Another Village called <hi>Chivramonte,</hi> had yet a worſe Fate. The ſhake of the 9<hi>th.</hi> ſhattered the Houſes, but that of the 11<hi>th.</hi> overturn'd them all together, and buried the Inhabitants in their Ruins, which were computed to be between three and four Hundred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monteruſſo</hi> was conſiderably ſhaken both on the 11<hi>th.</hi> and 9<hi>th.</hi> but the only loſs of the People was of about 200 that fled into the Caſtle, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon an Eminence for ſhelter, who were, with the Caſtle it ſelf, buried in the Ground, and the place where it ſtood is now a Pool of Water of a briniſh Taſte.</p>
            <p>The Beautiful Town of <hi>Vizzini</hi> underwent a Fortune like that of <hi>Catanea.</hi> Scarce any Place ſeem'd more ſecure from ſuch Accidents than it; for it lay on a riſing Hill, made up of nothing but hardeſt Stones of the nature of Marble; yet on the 9<hi>th.</hi> and ſome days before, it felt ſeveral ſhakes, which did no great damage, by reaſon of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings being all of Stone. However the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants began to fear the worſt, and moſt of the People of Quality and Faſhion went out of Town, and ſetled themſelves in Tents upon the Hill above the Town. But thinking the hazard was over, as finding no ſhakes all the 10<hi>th.</hi> they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96012:14"/>
return'd home on the 11<hi>th.</hi> in the Morning, and within ſome Hours thereafter they and the Town were ſwallowed up. The Inhabitants were rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to amount to 3500 Souls.</p>
            <p>The large Village of <hi>Modica,</hi> containing about 1400 People, was ſo ſuddenly ſwallowed up on the 9<hi>th,</hi> that no one Perſon eſcap'd; and it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the only Place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the whole Iſland that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not its full Ruin by the ſhake of the 11<hi>th.</hi> This was not the firſt time that <hi>Modica</hi> has been laid in heaps by Earthquakes; for within theſe Hundred years, it has twice changed its Seat; though till now the People were all ſo happy as to ſave themſelves, and to ſeek for new Seats.</p>
            <p>Within two Miles of this Place, there runs a ſmall River along a very narrow but fruitful Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, which in ſome places admits of high Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts, through the great inequality of the Channel. By the ſhake of the 11<hi>th</hi> there is a Hill thrown over, or rather athwart one of theſe Cataracts, for ſome twenty paces breadth, ſo that in that place the River is not to be ſeen, but creeps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Hill, and comes out again in its own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Channel below. The ſame Accident has happened to ſeveral Rivulets in <hi>Sicily;</hi> the Earth being torn from the Brink, and thrown over the Rivulet, as it were in the form of a Vault, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Bridge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:96012:15"/>
The Village <hi>Biſenti</hi> felt all the ſhakes that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, but received no other damage than the fall of ſome of the Houſes, and the Bruiſing to Death of about a Hundred Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francofonte,</hi> a very pretty Town, and well In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, but Built moſt of Timber, received lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle damage by the Earthquake, though it ſhook down ſome Houſes; but what the Earthquake did not, the Lightning and Thunder did: For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there ſeen ſo terrible a Storm of both theſe laſt, than <hi>Francofonte</hi> felt for three days together. The Spire of the Steeple, which was built of Wood, and covered with Lead, was burnt down, and the Nunnery of the <hi>Carmelites</hi> was almoſt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed, and that ſo ſuddenly, that five of the Nuns was ſtifled to Death in their Beds. If the Wind had been high, as it was not, certainly the whole Town had been burnt to Aſhes; but by reaſon of the Calmneſs of the Wind, and the Care of the Inhabitants, there were not above twelve or fourteen Houſes burnt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carlontini,</hi> a Town of good Trade, and very well Inhabited, was greatly ſhaken on the 9<hi>th,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Houſes being thrown down, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple buried in their Ruins. On the 10<hi>th</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Magiſtrates exhorred the Inhabitants to remove out of the Town to the Fields, for even then there was ſome ſmall tremblings of the Earth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96012:15"/>
felt almoſt every half Hour. The People began to get out of Town on the 10<hi>th,</hi> about Four a Clock in the Afternoon, and moſt were gone with the beſt things they could carry with them; when the ſhake of the 11<hi>th</hi> overturn'd the whole Town in a Moment, with what remain'd of the Inhabitants. The Place might contain about 4000 People; and it's thought about a ſixth part have periſh'd in the Earthquake.</p>
            <p>There ſcarce can be found in any part of the World a more Beautiful Town than <hi>Raguſa.</hi> Its Scituation, Buildings, Churches, Monaſteries, and Territories about it, combine to make it a ſort of Terreſtrial Paradiſe. It felt a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſmall ſhakings on the 8<hi>th,</hi> with a mighty Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of Lightning and Thunder. The ſhake of the 9<hi>th</hi> did ſome, but no great hurt; but that of the 11<hi>th</hi> overturn'd the Town-houſe, a very Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb Edifice, two Churches, and a great many Houſes. One Street, the biggeſt of the Town, and Inhabited by the beſt Merchants and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Place, was overwhelm'd in leſs than the Second of a Minute, the Earth ſinking down, and leaving a vaſt <hi>Caſma</hi> where the Street was. One of the Churches ſunk after the manner the Street had done, but the other fell down. It's not yet known how many People periſhed in <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſa;</hi> but the leaſt Calculation has been made of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96012:16"/>
them, amounts to 8000 Souls, of whom the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the beſt Quality make up a great part of the number. There is to be ſeen from the Brink of this <hi>Caſma</hi> I mentioned, the Tops of ſome of the Houſes, a great way below the Superfice of the ground; and out of this Cavity there comes a Sulphurous Smell, like to choak any body that comes near it. One of the Churches that are Ruin'd, was that of <hi>Sancta Barbara,</hi> Famous through all <hi>Sicily</hi> for the Miracles done at the Shrine of that Saint, and in which was ſome of the beſt Sculpture, eſpecially that of the Altar-piece, that could be ſeen in any place of the Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Scodia</hi> felt the ſhakes of the 9<hi>th</hi> and 11<hi>th</hi> as fiercely as any. Yet, which was ſtrange, the Town it ſelf received no damage; but the Biſhop's Palace, a very Beautiful and new Building, was overturn'd on the 9<hi>th,</hi> and about Twenty four Perſons periſh'd in its Ruins. The Biſhop had not gone out but an Hour before, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving held a Meeting of his Dioceſs in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of his Palace in the Morning, ſo that he and they were all ſav'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Specafurno,</hi> a Town of a conſiderable bigneſs, lying on the South ſide of a Hill all planted with Vineyards, and very well Inhabited, fell under the common Calamity. The ſhake of the 9<hi>th</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96012:16"/>
did it but little hurt, only the Convent of the <hi>Capuchins</hi> was deſtroyed; but all the 10<hi>th</hi> from Morning till Night, there was never heard ſo violent a Storm of Thunder and Lightning, as if Heaven and Earth had been mixing together. By the Lightning the Town-houſe, a very Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Building, was burnt down to the Ground, with ſeveral other Houſes. Some few of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants fled out of the Town on the 10<hi>th</hi> at Night, and ſo eſcaped the Deſtruction that befel the reſt upon the 11<hi>th.</hi> That ſhake brought over the whole Town in a Moments time; and there now remains nothing but vaſt heaps of Rubbiſh where <hi>Specafurno</hi> ſtood. To the South ſide of the Town, about a Mile, there lyes a very pleaſant freſh-Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lake abounding in Fiſh, which now is almoſt all dry Land; only what Water remains in one end of it, is of a Briniſh Taſte, and of a Black Colour, the Fiſh being all dead on the Shore. It's remark'd by the Peaſants that live on the Hills about this Town; that the Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which happened on the 10<hi>th,</hi> has ſo far burnt all the Vines, that they expect no Grapes to grow on them next Year: Not only ſo, but they ſmell a ſort of Sulphurous Smell, and feel a kind of a Bituminous Dew upon the Ground all thereabout. The People that periſh'd in <hi>Speca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furno</hi> are computed to amount to 3500 at leaſt,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96012:17"/>
there being about 300 only that ſav'd themſelves by a timely flight the day before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sicily</hi> could not brag of a better-built Town, and a Place of better Trade, conſidering its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Sea, than the Town of <hi>Scichito</hi> was. This Place ſeem'd to be deſign'd by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to fall by an Earthquake, for within theſe Fifty Years it has been in hazard Eight times. Five Years ago it had a very conſiderable ſhake, which indamaged ſeveral of the Houſes, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd a Church Dedicated to St. <hi>Roch.</hi> But all this was nothing to what befel it in this laſt Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. The trembling of the Earth began to be felt on the 8<hi>th</hi> at Night, and within twenty four Hours time there ſucceeded above twenty ſhakes one after another, the laſt ſtill exceeding the firſt in violence. At laſt the ſhake of the 11<hi>th,</hi> inſtead of overturning the Town, as in moſt other Places, the Earth here ſunk down, and in leſs than two Moments the Town vaniſh'd our of ſight. In its room there is now a ſtinking Pool of Water, where the <hi>Dome</hi> of the Church of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> with a part of the Steeple of St. <hi>Salvator</hi> ſtands above the Water. It's thought there was no one ſav'd of all the Inhabitants of this pleaſant Town; and they were Calculated to be about the number of Six or Seven Thouſand Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:96012:17"/>
There ſtood a very ſtrong Caſtle built after the <hi>Gothick</hi> Faſhion on the Eaſt ſide of the Town, belonging to the Family of <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </hi> it's now all in heaps, and about thirty People buried alive in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cefamero,</hi> a Village containing about 200 Houſes, and ſeated on a riſing Ground, was much ſhaken on the 8<hi>th,</hi> 9<hi>th,</hi> and 10<hi>th,</hi> but the ſhake of the 11<hi>th</hi> overturn'd the Church, whither moſt of the People had fled for ſhelter, and to implore the Aid of St. <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Sienna,</hi> whoſe Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel there, was held in the greateſt Reverence; they were all cruſh'd to Death with the fall of the Roof, being of Lead, and little other damage done in the Village it ſelf. It is thought there were near 200 People periſh'd in the Church, and ſome 20 in the Village.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sainto Croce,</hi> another Village ſomething bigger than <hi>Cefamero</hi> was as ill ſhaken as the other, though there was not ſo many People kill'd. The Church here ſtands intire, and only the Houſes that were made of Timber have ſuffered, and in them near a Hundred of the Inhabitants, the reſt having fled to the Fields without the Town.</p>
            <p>The little Town of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iamontano</hi> was greatly ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the 11<hi>th,</hi> that whole quarter that lay near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the River being quite overturned, and all the People kill'd; the reſt of the Town eſcaped,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96012:18"/>
only a ſmall Hoſpital near the South-gate was ſunk into the ground, with the People in it, which might amount to 40. Thoſe that periſhed in the Quarter neareſt the River, were about 350 Souls.</p>
            <p>The Tower of <hi>Licodia</hi> underwent very near the ſame Fate. All the Houſes of Timber were overwhelm'd by the ſhake of the 11<hi>th,</hi> and in them about 300 of the Inhabitants. The Houſes of Stone ſtand yet, though much ſhattered, and the <hi>Dome</hi> of the Church was burnt down by Lightning the day before. There is one thing more remarkable fallen out near this Town. About a mile and a half from it, there is a pretty high ſteep Hill, famous for Pine-trees of a vaſt big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that grow upon it. The Lightning and Thunder has burnt down and ſcorch'd moſt of thoſe Trees, and on the top of the Hill there is a <hi>Vulcano</hi> opened, out of which there aſcends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly a very thick Smoak, which is the more ſtrange, in that there was no ſuch thing heard of in that part of <hi>Sicily</hi> before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faci,</hi> a very big Town, was greatly ſhattered, eſpecially in the fall of two Churches on the 9<hi>th,</hi> the time of Divine Service. Many of the Houſes of the Town were overturn'd on the 11<hi>th,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with two Convents; and particularly that of the <hi>Minimes,</hi> where was kept St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Net, in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96012:18"/>
which he took that vaſt quantity of Fiſh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Goſpel. By the fall of the Houſes and Churches, there periſhed in all about 2000 People, whereof more than the half died by the fall of the two Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>La Motta,</hi> a Village, the moſt famous of the whole Iſland, and the ordinary retirement in the Summer-time of the Citizens of <hi>Palermo,</hi> was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally overturn'd on the 9<hi>th,</hi> and now there remains no Veſtige of it, a Salt Pool ſucceeding in its place. The Inhabitants were reckoned to be about 200 people.</p>
            <p>The laſt place of <hi>Sicily</hi> I ſhall name, that felt this Earthquake, was <hi>Meſſina,</hi> a City of great Trade, Superb Buildings, and great Riches. The ſhake of the 9<hi>th</hi> was here felt ſo ſenſibly, that it ſtruck a terror into the Inhabitants, that more than half of them forſook the City, and betook themſelves to the Fields. Thoſe that remained, betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Devotions, and all the Churches were throng'd with the multitudes of people, young and old, that flocked to them. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Meſſina</hi> had order'd 48 hours prayers to be ſaid through the whole City, and ſeveral Reliques to be carried in proceſſion to appeaſe the wrath of Heaven. On the 11<hi>th</hi> the whole City was ſo terribly ſhaken, that twenty ſix Palaces were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and a great many of the Timber-Houſes.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96012:19"/>
Every body expected immediate death, and in vaſt multitudes run to the Cathedral, where the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Meſſina</hi> preach'd, and ſaid Maſs, and thereafter gave Abſolution, as did all the Prieſts through the reſt of the City by the Archbiſhop's Command. After abſolution given, every-body made the beſt of the way they could to eſcape from the common danger, and betook themſelves to the Fields, where they were not out of hazard through the violence of the Thunder, Lightning and Rain, that continued three days together. The Archbiſhop retir'd with the reſt, and at laſt the people did ſet up Tents to protect them from the Injuries of the Weather. There are but few peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple kill'd in <hi>Meſſina,</hi> but moſt of the Churches are ſhattered more or leſs, and the Chappel of the Archbiſhop's Palace overturn'd.</p>
            <p>This mighty ſtroke of God was not only on the Land, but was felt alſo on the Sea. For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ships and ſmaller Veſſels were drowned all along the Coaſt of the Iſland, and even in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, by the violent agitation of the Water. Neither was there ever ſeen ſo high, and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous a Tyde as that of the 10<hi>th,</hi> being above three foot higher in moſt parts, than ever was heard of before.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, a more aſtoniſhing, a more univerſal, or a more ſwift Deſtruction was never known.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96012:19"/>
And <hi>Sicily,</hi> that was one of the beautiful'ſt, richeſt and fruitful'ſt Iſlands in the World, is now a heap of Rubbiſh, and a continued Deſolation.</p>
            <p>It's impoſſible to make a computation of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Loſſes of Money, Merchandize, Houſes and Lands. It may modeſtly be computed to at leaſt ſix Millions of <hi>Ducats;</hi> and it will take an Age to repair the Damages it has made. The number of the Inhabitants that periſhed in this afrightful Calamity, may be ſafely reckoned to come to 120000 Souls, over and above a vaſt number bruiſed by the fall of Churches and Houſes, whereof many are dead ſince, and ſome continue yet in hazard, which may amount to 20000 more.</p>
            <p>This Terrible Earthquake has communicated it ſelf to the Iſland of <hi>Maltha</hi> on the one ſide, and to <hi>Calabria</hi> on the other; and the Deſolations it has made in both thoſe Places, are ſaid to be very great. When the Particulars come to us, we ſhall give an ample Narrative of them.</p>
