            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe enſuing Diſcourſe is intended as a check to a malicious and
unquiet ſpirit, ſavouring of perfection; which hath ever been
incident to a ſort of people, who aſſume to themſelves the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Title of the Miniſters of the Goſpel (though very
improperly appropriated to them) whoſe conſtant practiſe throughout all
Ages and Nations, hath a tendancy to advance their own Power and
Domination, though in the deſtruction, blood, and ruine of whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Commonwealths. Whatever oppoſeth them in the
Deſigne of their own glory,<note place="margin">Witneſs the late treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deſigne of M. <hi>Love,</hi> and his Adherents.</note> must be accurſed with <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Maranatha.</hi> The forementioned evil Spirit, hath (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what account, or for what cauſe I know not, excepting
difference of Judgement in matters of Religion) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to its accuſtomed manner, virulently calumniated the Author in
his Name and Reputation; having ſo far prevailed upon the minds of
ſeven Gentlemen in and about <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> (who pretend to be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Jeſus Chriſt) as to engage them in the promotion and proſecution
of that unworthy Deſigne and Undertaking, complained of, and detected
in the ſubſequent Treatiſe. But how diſproportionable ſuch proceedings
are to the meekneſs, love, and tenderneſs of our Saviour; as alſo to
that univerſal Rule of the Goſpel, <hi>Do unto all men as you would they
ſhould do unto you:</hi> and how unlike to the gracious and prudent car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of the faithful followers of the Lord Jeſus, let all ſober minded
men judge.</p>
            <p>It is the ſaying of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Oppreſſion makes a wiſe man
mad:</hi> and I obſerve ſome men are ſo mad to oppreſs and perſecute the
Saints and People of God; that (like <hi>Paul</hi> before converſion, <hi>Acts</hi>
26. 11. they think as himſelf confeſſeth <hi>v.</hi> 9.) they may do things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the way of Jeſus Christ. But for my part, I take it as my
Duty (in order to the command of my God) to plead the cauſe of the
Oppreſſed, and vindicate the Innocent.</p>
            <p>Therefore being ſenſible how much the traduced Author Captain
<hi>Everard</hi> hath been impaired in Reputation, I could do no leſs in point
of common Juſtice, then manifeſt my knowledge of him, whoſe faithful
and conſtant ſervice to the Commonwealth, and ſufferings for the things
<pb facs="tcp:46363:3"/>
of Chriſt for ſome years past his integrity of life and ſobriety in declaring his judg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
during the time of his aboad at Newcaſtle, of which experience hath informed
me, was ſufficient to have exempted him from the ſcandal of the pens and tongues of
his enemies. And although the Author ſuffereth in his reputation, by the miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of divers, who take him to be that <hi>Everard</hi> that is reported to be deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the Ranting Principle; yet all that are acquainted with his perſon, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and practiſe, know him to diſſent as much, and to be as great a diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
of that way and opinion, which the other <hi>Everard</hi> profeſſeth and practiſeth as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
of thoſe who aſperſe him in writings, or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>As touching my ſelf, though I am wrongfully blamed for countenancing Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Everard</hi> in that which I apprehend to be juſt; yet I am the leſſe carefull in my
own vindication, conſidering I am reſponſible for my actions to their Superiours,

            <head>Articles exhibited againſt Captain
Robert Everard.</head>
            <p>1. HE maintaines and divulges many groſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
Opinions, as the Page following
ſhewes; which are the conſtant, and (in a manner) the only
matter of his preaching; the manner thereof being in a
jeering and flouting way.</p>
            <p>2. He gloryeth that he hath gathered many Churches
(as he cals them) of his own Opinion up and down the
Land; which if his eyes were opened, would be his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and ſhame.</p>
            <p>3. He is a notorious vain Boaſter, frequently and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
biding defiance to all the Prieſts (as he cals them) in
<hi>England</hi> to diſpute with him, when (ſorry man) he wants
skill to frame an Argument: He brags he will diſpute in
<hi>Latine, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew;</hi> and yet when he was put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, he could not read one word in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Its his frequent practiſe both in publick and private,
to ſcorn and caſt an odium upon all the Miniſters; calling
them Prieſts, deluders of the People, falſe Prieſts, ſaying
(when he was adviſed to more ſobriety) he will Preach
againſt them as falſe Prieſts; and this he ſpeaks againſt all
the Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> without the leaſt exception; and
for all the Miniſters in <hi>New-caſtle</hi> he ſaith in the Pulpit,
they are <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ool toyes, and that when they will not diſpute
with him themſelves, they ſend their Dogs to bark at
him: He told alſo M. <hi>Durant</hi> to his face divers times, that
he lied, and was a falſe Prieſt.</p>
            <p>By which ſcurrilous and uncivil dealings of his, ſome
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46363:5"/>
of his followers have learned to be ſo audacious, that one
of them called Doctor <hi>Jeniſon</hi> a Miniſter of the Divel: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſent this meſſage to M. <hi>Wels,</hi> go tell him that I ſay
he is a Divel, and that the Miniſters of <hi>New-caſtle</hi> are a
company of ſilly ignorant fellows, not able to anſwer any
queſtion, good for nothing but to Baptize babes, and
teach men to ſing <hi>Hopkins</hi> jigs, and that they Preach only
for Lucre, and will turn any way, and Preach the Divel for
Money.</p>
            <p>5. He ſo interrupted M. <hi>Sydenham</hi> betwixt the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations
of the Ordinances, that it occaſioned a Tumult
in the Congregation; at which time he ſo ſtank of Drink,
that many ſuſpected he had taken too much.</p>
            <p>6. After he had preached ſundry times in the hearing
of many hundreds againſt any Original ſin in man, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Maſter <hi>Hamond</hi> in <hi>Everards</hi> own hearing had Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the contrary Doctrine, and Vindicated thoſe Scriptures
abuſed by him, he came to M. <hi>Hamond</hi> (and to amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to ſee ſuch impudency) ſaid, that he had never
Preached againſt Original ſin, and that they abuſed him
that told him ſo, but that he was juſt of his judgement in
that point, and would Preach the ſame things that very
afternoon that he had in the forenoon; and yet after this,
went and Preached againſt what M. <hi>Hamond</hi> had done,
and ſince that alſo, in publick diſputes maintains the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
ſo that by theſe and ſuch other like contradictions,
we plainly ſee, that he will ſay and unſay any thing, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his errors, and further his deſign.</p>
            <p>7. Its uſual for him when ſome of our Miniſters preach
the truth in the forenoon, to ſtep into the ſame Pulpit, take
up the ſame Text in the afternoon, and abuſe both the
Text, Truth, and Miniſter too; and tell the people the
Preacher in the morning had deluded them.</p>
            <p>8. Such is his hatred to Orthodox Preachers, that he
ſaid in a Sermon in publick, that he had rather ſide with
the Papiſts, then with the Miniſters of <hi>New-caſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:46363:6"/>
To conclude, Such have been his own and his followers
inſolent provocations, that had not the fear of God poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
the Spirits of his people in this Town, there had
certainly been raiſed ſad combuſtions: But bleſſed be God
they bare all patiently, chuſing rather humbly to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, and thoſe in Authority to rectifie ſuch diſorders.</p>
            <p>As long as the Noble Col. <hi>Fairfax</hi> abode in this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
he (through his Pious care and prudence) kept
all in quiet and Peace; but after his departure,
Lieut. Col. <hi>Maſon</hi> (commanding in chief) hath not
only permitted this Deluder to Act his part, but hath
by all means and ways authorized and incouraged
him to do what he hath done.</p>

ANSWER
To an envious Letter, ſent to the
Lord General CROMWEL, by ſeven men,
who would be accounted Miniſters of the Gopel;
living in and near Newcaſtle upon Tyne: Whoſe Naems
are hereunder written.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the firſt twelve lines they ſpeak ſuch
Truth, that no man acknowledging
the Scriptures to be the Word of
God can deny; <hi>viz. That there is
not any thing more diſcovered and
reproved then falſe Teachers; with
ſutable Titles, as Deceivers, bringers
in of Damnable Hereſie, &amp;c.</hi> Such
an Authority of Diſcovering and Reproving had the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and did improve it; though oftentimes by the poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of ill affected Governors and people, they were many
times trampled under feet by thoſe proud malicious ſpirits,
that is to ſay, Perſecuters.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs the Apoſtles would have been thankful to
God to enjoy thoſe Priviledges without moleſtation;
but you have this priviledge, to call them which you judge
to be deceivers, <hi>Men of corrupt minds, Sowers of Tares,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:46363:7"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>educing ſpirits, &amp;c. and what would you have more? Becauſe
you deſire my Lord Generall to improve his intereſt in the high
Court, you ſay, to reſtrain ſuch men as I am; but what reſtraint
you would have to pleaſe you I know not: Would you have me
ſilenc'd, whipt, gagg'd, my ears ſlit, baniſhed or hanged?</p>
            <p>Oh! Would you invite our noble Senators to tyranny, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
their humane authority to fulfill your corrupt luſts? would
you have a humane power exerciſed in divine things, to puniſh
men for differing in expoſition of Scripture texts? then muſt
you acknowledge them to have infallibility of ſpirit, to judg of
error in doctrine, and puniſhment in relation to quality, quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
time and place: May not I ſay to you, as the Lord our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
once did, <hi>You know not what ſpirit you are of:</hi> yet you may
be known by your actions.</p>
            <p>2. Again, you cry out againſt me as a ſoul-deceiver, and I
frequently preach that all that God gave his Son for, or his Son
died for, are elected, and cannot be deceived by any man: if ſo
none of them can be deceived, then I am ſure none of thoſe that
had no probability to be ſaved could be deceived, unleſſe to bring
them to eternall life was a deceit, which (by your ſaying) <hi>Robert
Everard</hi> nor any other man can do.</p>
            <p>3. Again you ſay, I crept into <hi>Newcastle</hi> among your flocks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I rid into your town called <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and abode there
about foure moneths, preaching the Word of God (as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Scripture) three or foure times a week, paying every
man for all ſuch things as I had uſe for, as Mr. <hi>Rybbon</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
can ſpeak, where I lodged and dieted.</p>
            <p>Thoſe people were ſo far of my judgment, that they love to
ſpeak the truth, and not envious to any; ſuch a creeper into <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi>
was I.</p>
            <p>I did not demand 100. l. 200. l. or 300. l. a yeare of them:
ſuch a creeper was not I.</p>
            <p>4. You ſay, that Lievtenant-Colonell <hi>Maſon</hi> and Capt. <hi>Pym</hi>
were upholders of me to ſeduce the people and garriſon of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi>
and (as you alledge) to act my part by authority, which is
anſwered in the Epiſtle to the Reader. So that you may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for ſlandering ſuch civill, juſt and faithfull men.</p>
            <p>5. Again, you tell the L. Generall, that corrupt doctrines take
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46363:8"/>
ſooner, run faſter, and proceed farther then the truth can do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who told you ſo? it was Gods ſaying to <hi>Adam,</hi>
What, did you eat of the forbidden fruit? I tell you what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
runs ſwift and far, and takes quick, namely baptizing of
infants, which comes by the proclamation of man; and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Tithes as a forced maintenance, which has ſpread it ſelf
all Chriſtendome over. If you mean theſe doctrines, or the like, I
confeſſe they are corrupt; but that they go farther then the truth
can do, that I deny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they are beleaguered round about with
truth, and the people (like valiant ſouldiers) are ready to ſpring
their mines.</p>
            <p>4. And whereas you ſay, I vent errors pleaſing to the
fleſh, which foreſaid doctrines have for a long time ſatisfied your
fleſhly minds.</p>
            <p>5. Alſo you ſay, one dram of deadly poyſon kills more then
the beſt medicines can cure: And you ſay it is corrupt doctrine,
conſiſting of ſuch errors as I hold. Somthing is the matter that
you do not uſe the beſt medicines; it ſeems it is your judgments
they will do no good, and therfore you make uſe of the worſt;
having no experience of drawing people from the errors of their
wayes.</p>
            <p>6. Again you ſay you humbly conceive, that as Popery was
heretofore, ſo Arminianiſm and Socinianiſm are like to be the
plagues of this poor Nation, even that curſed doctrine which ſo
much plucks down God and ſets up man.</p>
            <p>In anſwer, If there be any doctrine that plucks down God and
ſets up man in his ſtead, it is mans aſſumed authority to make laws
and impoſe them upon the people, which is not to be found in the
records of God; and two of theſe ſtrings you have to your bow,
which if once they were broken, man would be more thrown
down, and God exalted, namely forced maintenance of your bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
which cannot be had without an arbitrary power, by which
you contend to dethrone God and his appearance in his people, as
it appears by your appealations to humane authority, to ſet up
your ſelves more then the Kingly power of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſtring you have played upon for a long time, hath
been the Popiſh inſtitution of ſprinkling infants, perſwading the
people that they are made Chriſtians by their parents faith,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46363:8"/>
though they live in covetouſneſſe, pride and envy as well as your
ſelves. And for further anſwer I refer you to a book intituled,
<hi>Old Popery in a new dreſs of Preſbytery,</hi> ſold in Popes-head Alley
at <hi>Lodowick Lloyd</hi> his ſhop.</p>
            <p>7. Again, you deſire the Lord Generall to be a deſtroyer of
your errors. If you conceive your ſelves to be in errors as well as
my ſelf, then you ſhould deſire no more to be done unto me then
to your ſelves: But you are not true to your principles; for you
concluded the beſt medicines could not cure an error: And what
would you make of my Lord Generall, the beſt medicine put to a
vain uſe?</p>
            <p>8. Again, you ſay the Lord Generall hath been a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
of your enemies in the three Nations: But upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
you ſtile them enemies is beſt known to your ſelves, and in
part to me. I count them enemies, becauſe they ſtood for a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intereſt, inconſiſtent with the freedom, peace and ſafety of the
Nations; who would ſet up the wills of men by unlawfull Courts
and Councells, to lord it over the eſtates, perſons and conſciences
of men, whereby they cenſured men by unreaſonable fines and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
without legall trialls by Juries, which is indeed the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
Conſtitution of this Nation. Now if they were your
enemies upon this account, why then go you about to make the
Lord Generall your Solicitor againſt me to the high Court to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
me from my native liberties? What, would you have me a
priſoner at the will and pleaſure of any perſon, being not procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
againſt in a legall way? Doth not the Law lie open? If not,
how are your enemies conquered? But I more then ſuppoſe you
did not look upon the Scots as enemies upon the foreſaid conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
being well aſſured, that when the Lord Generall with
the Commonwealths Army were in greateſt ſtraights, then the
Prieſts of this Nation for the moſt part preached with their faces
to the North; yea and lifted up their rebellious hands to heaven
with ſtrong cries and tears, praying to God (who neither heard
nor anſwered them) <hi>That he would be pleaſed to help his people the
Scots, and proſper his cauſe in their hands, and in the hands of that
Young man lately converted by taking the Covenant:</hi> Whereas it is
eminently known in the Counties of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Rutland,</hi> that
my ſelf and Capt. <hi>John Freeman</hi> oppoſed them at their running
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46363:9"/>
Lectures for preaching againſt the Army: And when it pleaſed
God to give victory to our Armies, then they preached Sermons
full of lamentation, making the people groan like the Prieſts of
<hi>Scotland;</hi> at which time they of your calling were ſo far from
creeping into the army, that in time of ſervice they crept out of
the army; witneſſe <hi>Dundee</hi> and elſwhere.</p>
            <p>9. Again, you ſay, the three Nations are delivered from tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and ſlavery, that God hath given great and many glorious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
to our Forces under the conduct of the L. Generall <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
is very apparent, for which you ſay you bleſſe God; and I
am ſure we have all cauſe to praiſe him that loves peace; but that
we are freed from tyranny and ſlavery in the three Nations I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
becauſe there remains ſome of that Norman Tyranny ſtill for
the Parliament of the Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> to remove,
without which we cannot be happy, nor rejoyce, or make our
boaſt that we are delivered from tyranny and ſlavery, as long as
we heare that a poor mans Cauſe cannot be heard for want of
money. Again, do not we ſee many a man impoveriſhed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of delayes in Courts? and do not we ſee many a poor man
travell to <hi>London</hi> with great expence of money and time, and loſſe
at home, to agree with their adverſaries, which may be done in
their own neighbourhood? Is not this ſlavery and oppreſſion, as
well as triple damages for Tythes, which makes the people groan
for want of juſt proceedings in Law?</p>
            <p>But happily you will ſay, theſe are your grievances in truth;
then we may expect better fruits then to be of a perſecuting ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which is generally incident to men of your profeſſion: And,
I believe, ſo long as a hireling Miniſter remains in this Nation, it
will not be abſolutely free from tyranny and ſlavery.</p>

            <p>1. YOu ſay I maintain many deſtructive opinions, and that my
manner of preaching is in a jeering and flowting way.</p>
            <p>As for the deſtructiveneſſe of thoſe things which I hold forth,
I confeſſe them to be deſtructive to many of your opinions. I ſhall
inſtance one amongſt twenty; as the baptizing of thoſe that do
make confeſſion of their ſin, or profeſſion of the faith, which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
childiſh Baptiſm as a deviſed Fable: And at one time more
eſpecially I preached upon that point in <hi>Newcastle,</hi> to undeceive
the people who were by you captivated; and I took the Prophet
<hi>Elias</hi> method, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. from verſ. 22. to 27. to ſee if I could
end the difference, pleading that the people were very willing to
ſee their Prophets tried; ſo as it was agreed, that that God
which anſwered by fire from heaven ſhould be the onely God to
be worſhipped. So I made this propoſall, calling the Scriptures
the true fire from heaven, laying down the doctrine of <hi>John,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the baptiſm of water, which came from thence, deſiring the
people to lay down in their thoughts the ſprinkling of infants at
a diſtance; and I called to God for fire, and it came from heaven,
and kindled the doctrine of <hi>Iohn</hi> in the ſight of all the people, and
many wondered when they ſaw the light ſhining ſo clear. Then I
deſired the Prophets to call aloud for fire in the preſence of the
people. And I confeſſe I further ſaid, that the god of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>viz.</hi> the ſprinkling of infants, was gone ſome far journey, or
fallen aſleep, and indeed I think the Author of it is dead long
ſince: And at other times men having preached that God blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the eyes of ſome men, and hardened the hearts of others that
never was in a capacity of ſeeing or having ſoft hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:46363:10"/>
I ſaid that no act of power or wiſdome of God could be ſeen
in ſuch a doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> to make a man blind that never was in a
poſſibility to ſee, and harden hearts that never were ſoft. Theſe
and ſuch like expreſſions uſually might fall from me, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
might have been ſpared, ſay you; and therefore you call it
jeering. When I am minded to pleaſe you I'le forbear, but in the
mean time know I cannot ſerve two maſters.</p>
            <p>2. You ſay that I gloried much that I have gathered many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of my own opinions. I have deſired all that know me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to call the truth of God my opinion, becauſe the Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is diſhonoured; which (you ſay) if my eyes were opened,
would be my ſorrow and ſhame, which intimateth that you judg
that I ſin not againſt known light, and would I could judg ſo of
you.</p>
            <p>3. You ſay, I am a notorious vain boaſter, boldly bidding defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to all the Prieſts in <hi>England</hi> to diſpute with me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I did not bid defiance to diſpute with any Prieſt, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
thereof offered ſo to do for the edification of the people,
that ſo by a loving conference differences might be ended in love,
which was both the practice and priviledge of the Saints in all
ages.</p>
            <p>4. You ſay I want skill to frame an argument: If I am ſo, I am
like to be ſo ſtill; for I could get none of you to confer with me:
So then Reader obſerve who is the proud vain boaſter.</p>
            <p>5. You ſay I offered to diſpute in Latine, Greek and Hebrew;
and when I was put to it could not read one word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That when I heard they denied diſpute, becauſe they
judged me ignorant, I offered to conferre or diſpute upon four ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
tongues, <hi>viz.</hi> Engliſh, Latine, Greek and Hebrew, but it
was with theſe cautions: 1. That the diſpute might be in Engliſh
in the publikeſt place convenient in the countrey or town for the
edifying of the people in love. 2. That for the other tongues, it
ſhould be private, becauſe very few underſtand them, amongſt
themſelves, and little conducing to the edification of the people
in piety.</p>
            <p>Again you ſay, when I was put upon it I could not read one
word of Greek or Hebrew.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All the ground you have to ſay I cannot read the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46363:10"/>
tongues, is becauſe I refuſed once to anſwer to Mr. <hi>Durants</hi>
digreſſion as from the point in hand: And when I ſaw he would
not be ſatisfied, being extreme paſſionate, I ſpake in Greek
as followeth, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
being 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. chap. 8. verſ. and Mr. <hi>Durant</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
me to ſpeak the words over again, which accordingly I did;
he anſwered I did not keep right ſtops, but I was not ſo much
beholden to him as to ſhew wherein I failed, as Major <hi>Merytan</hi>
and Captain <hi>Rogers</hi> and others can and will evidence. That Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
has ill Bears that will not come to the ſtake for his profit,
ſooner then you to a diſpute to edification.</p>
            <p>Again you ſay I have ſpoken againſt all the Miniſters in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
without the leaſt exception, calling them <hi>falſe Prieſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is an untruth; for there be many Miniſters in
<hi>England</hi> that I love and judg faithfull.</p>
            <p>Again you ſay I call all the Miniſters in <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> 300. l. Toyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is as true as the former; I can ſafely ſay I never
heard the phraſe untill I ſaw it under your own hands.</p>
            <p>Again, You ſay I call thoſe men your barking dogs that came
to diſpute with me, ſet on by you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. The Devill was a lyar from the beginning,</hi> whoſe works
you do when you deviſe theſe things, as I told Mr. <hi>Durant</hi> to his
face: and you will all appear ſo to the world, unleſſe you make
theſe Articles good by proof.</p>
            <p>Again, You ſay, ſome of my followers (as you call them) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Dr. <hi>Ieniſon</hi> a Miniſter of the Devill, and alſo Mr. <hi>Wells,</hi> with the
reſt of the Miniſters of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> they were ſo ignorant that
they could not anſwer a man any queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who you call my followers I know not; and if any of
them that heard me called them Divells, they learned no ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
from me: if I knew who they were, I would adviſe them
to forbeare.</p>
            <p>Again, as for their ſaying you are not able to anſwer to any
queſtion, I think they do you wrong, for I am ſure when the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
was propounded to forſake ſmall livings for greater, you
have anſwered them.</p>
            <p>Again, You ſay my followers report you are good for nothing
but to baptize babes, and teach men to ſing <hi>Hopkins</hi> Jiggs, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46363:11"/>
that you preach only for lucre, and will turn any way, and preach
the Devill for money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſay you are not good for that but evill for ſo doing:
what have I to do to make anſwer for other men, being as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the truth of your allegations againſt them, as I am certain
of the falſity of your accuſations againſt me. Surely ſhould I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
authority againſt you for what your hearers have ſaid and
done in things that I could prove, you would not be willing to
have articles exhibited againſt you: if ſo, then you do not as you
would be done unto, but that is no newes.</p>
            <p>Again you ſay I interrupted Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> betwixt the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
of the Ordinances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then it appears you will be my witneſſes, that I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
him not during the time of the adminiſtration of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
            <p>Again you ſay I interrupted him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> He deſired to ſee the face of that man, and heare him
ſpeak, that would or could deny infants baptiſm: thereupon I
offered him to tender the ground of my diſſent, he promiſing me
to diſpute the point before all the people: and I waited his time,
and for all this was diſappointed, and you ſay it occaſioned a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
in the congregation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If ſuch a behaviour of mine cauſed a tumult, the people
were not ſo well taught as the Diſciples of Chriſt were. If they
had, they would not have laid violent hands upon me, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my life in danger. Again, if I was guilty of making a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,
why then did not the Mayor and Aldermen put juſt autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in execution upon me, I deſiring them ſo to do at the very
ſame time, ſaying to them, if I have diſturbed the peace of the
Commonwealth this day, wherein you are all eye-witneſſes of my
behaviour, make me ſenſible of it, by executing juſtice upon me,
that J may for time to come learn not to offend: But if they
would not, J ſhould look upon it as no offence: and yet for all
this, you would incenſe Authority, that at that time J ſtank of
drink, that many ſuſpected J had taken too much. And ſuch was
the zeale of Lieutenant-Colonell <hi>Maſon</hi> (with ſome Officers) to
the glory of God and the peace of the Nation, and puniſhing of
vice, that they went to the civill Magiſtrate next morning, to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46363:11"/>
deſire that condigne puniſhment might be inflicted impartially
upon evill doers, ſaying, if any that did belong to the Regiment
that had offended, he would make them exemplary. And the
Mayor ſaid, if Capt. <hi>Robert Everard would apply himſelf to him, he
would do him all the right he could.</hi> At the ſame time ('tis well
known) J was pluckt down and abuſed by ſome rude people, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with Capt. <hi>Pym,</hi> laying violent hands upon him, calling of
him raſcall, &amp;c. all which was patiently born on our parts.</p>
            <p>Again you ſay, that J preached againſt any originall ſin in man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> J did preach that <hi>Adam</hi> was the firſt of mankind that
did tranſgreſſe, and by Gods appointment death ſeized upon all
mankind for his offence, and that his death was unavoidable, and
further ſay, that J hold all the originall ſin that the Scripture
makes mention of: and J heard Mr. <hi>Hamon</hi> preach the inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of natures attainments unto ſpirituall things, crying out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe that ſet up nature inſtead of grace, ſaying, that no
man could receive the things of God, unleſſe they were given him
from above. Then J went to him and gave him thanks for that,
telling him that I judged he was miſ-informed, for I knew none
that held out power in nature as in in it ſelf to attain to ſpirituall
injoyments; and I deſired him to tell me, if ever he read of any
that held forth the ſame; he ſaid not much to that, and to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him that I held not the point ſo falſly fathered upon me; and
that I would in the afternoon preach of natures inability to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
things; He replied, he was glad of that, and ſo we parted,
and accordingly J did. And whereas you ſay J preached againſt
Mr. <hi>Hamon,</hi> you do me much injury, as you have done in all your
falſe allegations. And whereas you ſay J ſay J told Mr. <hi>Hamon</hi>
that I never preached againſt originall ſin,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He and I had never a word about it, and you further
aſſert that I'le ſay and unſay any thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You muſt unſay many of thoſe things which you have
accuſed me of, otherwiſe your conſcience will bear teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you both here and hereafter as a juſt judgment of God.</p>
            <p>Again you ſay I ſtept into the pulpit in the afternoon, and took
the ſame text the Miniſter did in the morning, abuſing text and
Miniſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I confeſſe I preached in the afternoon in the ſame place,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46363:12"/>
and upon the ſame text, and whatſoever truth they delivered, as
much as in me lay, ſhewed my approbation to it: and where I
judged they were miſtaken, I ſhewed the people the reaſons of my
diſſenting; but I did not ſay the Miniſter had deluded them,
though it's probable he did; for I cannot conclude that every
one which heareth falſe doctrine is deluded, which if I ſhould, I
muſt have been deluded my ſelf by hearing you, for I heard you,
although you judg me by hear-ſay. O moſt unrighteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay ſuch is my hatred againſt orthodox Preachers,
that in publike I preached, that I had rather ſide with Papiſts, then
with the Miniſters of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You appropriate the title of orthodox Preachers to
your ſelves: That you have ſuch a propriety I deny: I might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have ſaid your actions deny it; witneſſe your covetouſneſſe,
ambition, envy and falſe accuſations; all which is inconſiſtent
with the pure doctrine of love and ſelf-deniall, which were the
injunctions and ractice of our bleſſed Saviour.</p>
            <p>Again you ſay I declared that I had rather ſide with Papiſts then
the Prieſts of <hi>Newcastle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> What is good in them or you I'le imbrace, and that which
is evill in both I will abandon. And as for the article which you
call your concluſion, wherin you reflect againſt the honor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of L. Col. <hi>Maſon,</hi> is anſwered ſufficiently in the Epiſtle,
to diſcover unworthineſſe.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay I hold that Election from eternity hath no
ground from Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I never aſſerted that, nor no point equivalent to it; and
whereas you ſay my judgment is contrary to <hi>Epheſ. 1. 4, 5. Rom.</hi> 8.
29, 30. you ought to unſay it, for I own it as the true manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God.</p>
            <p>Again, you declare that J ſhould ſay, thoſe that hold the moſt
part of the world goes to ruine, make the juſtice of God a great
monſter, which is another groſſe miſtake in you: and wheras you
ſay J hold points contrary to <hi>Mat. 7. 13, 14. Mat.</hi> 22. 14. is like the
reſt of your abuſes towards me.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay, I hold that <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity are not guilty of
<hi>Adams</hi> ſin, I ſay, they were not ſo guilty as that they did commit
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46363:12"/>
the ſame ſin, for the children before they are borne did neither
good nor evill, but none was born when that ſin was committed,
and the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>Rom. 5. 14. that death reigned over them that
had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of</hi> Adams <hi>tranſgreſſion,</hi> but if they
had committed the ſame ſin, then had it been like his, but it was
not; <hi>ergo,</hi> ſo I do not hold any thing contrary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. though
you are pleaſed to ſay ſo.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay, I hold that <hi>Adam</hi> had no ſpirituall light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If by ſpirituall light you meane the knowledge of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he had no ſuch light before the fall, and you in
<hi>Gen. 1. 7. Col.</hi> 8. 10. would make people believe that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
thoſe Texts in holding the foreſaid point; but there is not
a word there, nor any place elſe, that <hi>Adam</hi> had at that time any
ſuch light.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay, I hold that neither ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> nor any other
creature, doth procure death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I hold that ſin in any man doth not procure death as the
efficient cauſe, for that is God, who was the only contriver of
it, both for quality, quantity, time, and place.</p>
            <p>Neither was it the materiall cauſe, formall nor finall, as I have
made evident in my book called, <hi>the first</hi> Adam <hi>reviewed</hi> wherein
I have anſwered many objections, and have not contradicted,
<hi>Rom. 5. 12. 21. Rom.</hi> 6. 23.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay, no man ſins, except it be againſt his light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I hold no mans ſins, but againſt the Lord, which is light;
you ſay this is contrary to <hi>Lev.</hi> 5. 15.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay, I hold that ſuch as teach men to ſing Pſalmes,
teach men to tell lies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny that ever any man in the world heard me ſpeake
thoſe words, or any words like unto them, but inſtead thereof,
ſaid, that thoſe which ſet the people a ſinging ſuch things as they
call Pſalmes, being not taught, having no qualification ſuitable,
did provoke them to ſing lies, as for inſtance, <hi>O Lord I am not puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
in mind, &amp;c. and I have behaved my ſelf as the child that wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is, &amp;c. and we have not ceaſed to preach thy Lawes day and
night, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was ſo far from denying teaching of people to ſing Pſalmes,
that I pleaded for a neceſſity of teaching, preceding ſinging
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46363:13"/>
of Pſalmes, in order thereunto, took as much pains to teach the
people ſinging of Pſalmes, as I did in any other point I delivered
in Newcaſtle: So it ſeems you care not what you ſpeak againſt me,
as if you intended not to give an account in this world, nor in
the world to come.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay, I hold that Chriſt died for all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I hold that the Scripture ſayes, he died for all men,
and for every man, and not for Saints only, but for the ſins of the
whole world, and for all that live therein, and the dead alſo, as
1 <hi>Tim. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 6. Heb.</hi> 2. 9. firſt Epiſtle <hi>John 2. 2. 2 Cor. 5. 15. Rom.</hi> 14. 9.
and I hold it forth by theſe arguments.</p>
            <p>1. If the Goſpell is to be preached to all, then there is a death
of Chriſt for all: But there is a Goſpell to be preached to all,
therefore a death of Chriſt for all.</p>
            <p>2. If Chriſt died for falſe Teachers, which fell to deſtruction,
which were, and are the worſt of all men, then Chriſt died for all
men: But Chriſt died for falſe Teachers which fell to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which were, and are the worſt of men, therefore Chriſt died
for all men. So I have not excluded his death for you.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay, I hold that infants have no need of Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Repentance, or Regeneration, untill they actually ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I hold ſo, and theſe were my Arguments; 1. If Infants
have neither ſins of Omiſſion, nor Commiſſion; then they have no
need of converſion, repentance, or regeneration. But Infants have
neither ſins of Omiſſion or Commiſſion; Therefore,</p>
            <p>2. That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt never commanded his Diſciples to
come into ſuch a condition that had need of converſion, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
or regeneration; But our Lord Jeſus Chriſt commanded his
Diſciples to come into the condition of Infants; Therefore they
have no need of converſion, repentance, nor regeneration.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay, I hold that no man ſhall be condemned, but
for ſinning againſt the New Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is another of your miſtakes, for I do hold, that by
the offence of one condemnation came upon all men, according
to <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. and that in <hi>Adam</hi> all die, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. and that from
there Scriptures this condemnation ſhall univerſally be taken off
at the reſurrection of the juſt and unjuſt; and after that, the Judge
of the world ſhall not condemn any, but for ſins committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Goſpell, which I call the New-Covenant.</p>
