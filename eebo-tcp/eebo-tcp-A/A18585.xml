            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>When dolefull death had heard this hard deuise,</l>
               <l>He trim'd himselfe in his most godly guise,</l>
               <l>Like Mercurie in euery kind of grace,</l>
               <l>Saue that he had a much more louely face:</l>
               <l>And forth he flew till he came to the bed,</l>
               <l>Whereas this Prince lay neither quicke nor dead.</l>
               <l>But in a trance, for why his deadly griefe,</l>
               <l>With nature stroue to proue, who should be chiefe,</l>
               <l>But when weake Nature had consum'd her best,</l>
               <l>She yeelded streight and so the struggle ceast.</l>
               <l>VVhereby the King came to himselfe againe,</l>
               <l>And seeing Death he turn'd away amaine.</l>
               <l>For why? his youth and yet vnflowred breath,</l>
               <l>Could not consent to so vnripe a Death.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

Had such a do to hide his inward woe.</l>
               <l>But seeing the louely Prince was so afraid,</l>
               <l>With smiling cheere to comfort him he said:</l>
               <l>Belou'd of God abash not but assent,</l>
               <l>For God th'Almightie hath me to you sent:</l>
               <l>Who ruing sore your griefe and wofull case,</l>
               <l>Would haue you come to solace with his grace,</l>
               <l>In ioy, and blisse and euerlasting glorie,</l>
               <l>From earthly things all vile and transitorie:</l>
               <l>From this your state vncertaine and vnsure,</l>
               <l>Unto a Reigne that shall for aye endure:</l>
               <l>No sooner had our Soueraigne heard of this,</l>
               <l>But that his spirit that much had long'd for blis,</l>
               <l>Would needs away; howbeit his carefull mind,</l>
               <l>For this his Realme which he must leaue behind,</l>
               <l>Enforc't his Grace to pray Death stay a while:</l>
               <l>To th'end he might himselfe both reconcile</l>
               <l>To God the Lord, and also recommend,</l>
               <l>His Realme to him, for euer to defend,</l>
               <l>And while that Death for this cause gladly stay'd,</l>
               <l>He sat him vp and thus deuoutly pray'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>HAue mercy on me Father deere, thou Lord and God of truth,</l>
