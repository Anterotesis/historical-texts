            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102874:5"/>
Articles of your Faith: Believe certainly and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without the leaſt doubt, that there is a great and glorious God, that Jeſus Chriſt is his only Son, and the alone Saviour: That the Bible is the true Word of God: That undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is ſuch a place as Heaven and Hell, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Really believe, that you carry within your breſts, precious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſouls: which muſt be adjudged by this God to one of thoſe two places, there to be for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102874:5"/>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Aſſure your ſelves. that the laſt Sentence will be paſt according to your well or ill behaving your ſelves in this life. Every man ſhall be rewarded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Account upon it, that it's very difficult to come to that Heaven, and that the way to deſtruction is broad and eaſie. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſtill, you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful hearts within you, a wicked Devil nigh you, and ſnares and hinderances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

               <p>Say, my time is ſhort my work is great, and my ſtrength is ſmall.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Certainly believe it, that Heaven is ſo glorious, that it's worth all your care and pains, be it never ſo much: and that Hell is ſo dreadful, that you may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably fly from it with all diligence, earneſtneſs and ſpeed; that it's better you never had been born, if you ſhould die in your ſins, and periſh everlaſtingly: what a direful ſcreetch will your ſoul give, if it goes

out of your body into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable burnings? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.14, 16, 26.1 <hi>

               <p n="6">6. Reckon, that all the troubles of this world, can't make a man going to that Heaven in ways of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, miſerable and wretched: How ſweet will it be to paſs, though out of a poor tottering Cottage, into a glorious Palace? Out of a Sea of troubles and dangers, into an Haven of Peace, Reſt, and Plenty? Nor can all the Riches, Honours, and Pleaſures here, make a man going to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102874:7"/>
that Hell, happy: What a terrible Hell will Hell be to great ones, that have ſpent all their days in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure! It's much to change a Palace for the dark ſilent Grave; Jewels and Deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for worms and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs. But what is it to have ſweet ſingings turned into bitter howlings? Deckt and glittering rooms, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant walks, rich attire, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fare into dark Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, unquenchable lakes of fire and brimſtone? <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.15. to 18. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.16. to 21.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Seriouſly think, I may
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102874:7"/>
yet get to this Heaven, and avoid the fearful plagues and terrours of Hell. If I ſhall come to glory, what a God ſhall I enjoy for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ever? into what bleſſed arms and boſome ſhall I caſt my ſoul? and if I ſhould go to Hell at laſt, can I bear up under the weight of Gods vengeance? Well, yet there is hope; Gods heart, the door of Grace, and the Gate of Heaven, yet ſtand open. How would the damned in Hell give thouſands of worlds (if they had them) for my <hi>may be!</hi> Heaven,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102874:8"/>
Grace, and Chriſt are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and dare I refuſe all? Can I venture the loſs of ſoul and body for ever and ever? <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.30, 31.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If I miſs of glory, 'twill be mine own fault, my damnation will lie at my own door: God can clear himſelf of my blood; his profers of grace are free and frequent, earneſt and real; and ſhall I murder mine own ſoul? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.32. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. It may be written over my Grave, <hi>Here is one that deſtroyed himſelf, that would go to Hell thorow mercies, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102874:8"/>
and warnings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Debate the caſe with your ſoul ſolemnly, What is there in ſin, that I ſo much dote on? What are my greateſt deſigns and projects in the World? Can I dig the pearl of happineſs out of this dunghil World? Can I get the Houſes, Lands, Honours, Friends that I aim at? and if I ſhould, what are they? Certainly conclude, the greateſt wiſdom is to be wiſe to ſalvation, and my beſt work is to work it out with fear and trembling, leſt I loſe it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.13, 14. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:102874:9"/>10. Then ſearch and try your hearts, whether you are in the Faith, and your hearts ſound in Gods Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. Ask ſeriouſly, Have I the love that is ſincere, the Faith that is ſound, ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaving; and ſin-killing, and life-reforming? Am I ſure my face and heart are really ſet <hi>Sion</hi>-ward, and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>
               <p>To this end Query:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Did I ever ſee ſin o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, black and helliſh? Defiling and damning? Have I ſeen it in the glaſs of the Law, bloody and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? but in Chriſts blood,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102874:9"/>
exceeding, and above me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſinful?</hi> Rom. 7.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Do I ſee in Jeſus Chriſt a beauty and excellency, a fulneſs and all-ſufficiency? Is he the chiefeſt of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, altogether lovely in mine eye? Can I ſay, Oh! thouſand of gold (if I had it) for an intereſt in Chriſts blood, that cleanſing, heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Pea e-ſpeaking blood! None but Chriſt. All is but dung, that I may win him,</hi> Phil. 3.7, 8.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Take it for granted, that there is no name under heaven, whereby you can be ſaved, but Jeſus Chriſts.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102874:10"/>
All grace and mercy for this life, and that to come, muſt come to you thorow the channel of Chriſts blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30, 31. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.10, 11 12. Say, By ſin I have ſhut Heaven gate, and hardned Gods heart againſt me: I have laid my ſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to all the wrath of God, all the curſes inn the Bible, and all the torments of Hell: and if I could bring all the cries of my ſelf, and all my friends, the ſtrength of the Angels, the riches of all the world, it would be as nothing to make up this woful breach: Chriſt alone can do it.</p>

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102874:10"/>12. Believe it, that Chriſt came to ſeek and to ſave ſuch as we that were loſt. That he is not only able, but willing and ready to give forth his rich grace. What made him leave his Fathers boſome, put off the Majeſtick Robes of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but love to poor ſouls? What made him drink the dreadful cup of his Fathers wrath, make ſuch loud calls, ſuch rich proffers; wait, and ſend; be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and wait; cry ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and wait long, but love to ſinners? <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35, 37. 'Twas love to ſouls
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102874:11"/>
made him give up his body to be broken, that precious box of oyntment, which fills both heaven and earth with its ſweet ſavour, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant perfumes.</p>
               <p>Having throughly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and believed theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going propoſitions: then come to Chriſt theſe 13 ways.</p>
