            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But like as from the quietneſſe of the aire the Philoſopher ſuſpects an earth-quake, mee thinks the man that had not read this book, ſhould have read ſo much in the book of Nature, tane ſo much from poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick rules, as to fore-ſee a declenſion of things at perfection, to fear moſt a rebellion in a State moſt compoſed: ſuch was the ſtate of <hi>Adam,</hi> and with ſuch ſucceſſe, in the ſame day were his affections quiet and tumultuous; his will, which that day had well given up her name, revolted from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of reaſon, judge you how voluntarily

This is enough for me, this will bring me to my text, if I tell how the evill of ſin lets in the evill of paine, and that I find in the ſacred Hiſtory, that our firſt parents did eat, and this probable in the ſchoole, that they were both created, both ſtood, and both fell, and both in one day.

               </gap>, <hi>The Sun was darkened, and the Moone withdrew her light:</hi> but happy you ſuperiour lights, whoſe eclipſes are not ſins, the defects and anomies of humane actions are ſcann'd at the bar of juſtice, and bearing a guilt upon the offendent, will not be expiated but by ſuffering; for let the man but taſte of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited fruit, and he ſhall heare a voyce from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that voyce which breaketh the Cedars of Libanus, thundring out wrath, and this ſad doom, <hi>In the ſweat of thy face,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Since there is ſo neceſſary dependancie of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall acts upon intention, it is a good rule which the Philoſopher gives in the firſt of his Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Not to look ſo much to the letter of the Law, as the mind
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61208:5"/>
of the Law-giver:</hi> The expreſſe prohibition of eating was to one, but intended for all; one man, our firſt father did eat, and ſin; the ſin ran downe to his ſons, and to the ſons of their ſons, and to thoſe that did deſcend from them, to all nations, ſexes, conditions, times, and ages of the world, to the man that ſhall laſt ſee the Sun ſet. <hi>In the day that thou ſhalt eat, thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> as it ſayes more kinds of death than one, ſo more that ſhould dye than one; <hi>and to duſt thou ſhalt returne,</hi> was more than a perſonall ſentence, for all men were dead in one, and were <hi>gathered to their fathers,</hi> as to a living ſepulcher, larger, and more common than that which <hi>Abraham</hi> bought of <hi>Ephron</hi> the ſon of <hi>Zoar,</hi> which was but for him and for his houſe; ſo that it ſeemes to have a great deale of mind that which the Jewes ſo talk of, that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were buried in the ſame cave with <hi>Adam.</hi>

The Law-giver hath an eye to what is voluntarie and unvolunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; to the former by the rule of diſtributive ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, hee ſets out rewards and puniſhments; to the latter, neither reward nor puniſhment: How then does God puniſh the ſin of the firſt man in his poſteritie, that perſonally had done neither good nor ill? How could they conceive, and bring forth ſin, who yet themſelves were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or call it a ſin; ſhall it be a mortall ſin? <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Who blames a man for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne blind? That does the Judge of the great Court of heaven and earth: and ſurely the Almightie does not pervert juſtice, it is not with him as with thoſe Romane Praetors, <hi>Jus dicunt, cum iniqua decernunt:</hi> For like, as by a politicall union, many families become one body civill, ſo by participation of the ſame ſpecificall nature, were all men as one man; and like as the acts of any part of the body, as theft, or murder done by the hand, doe not aſcribe it to that part, but as it is moved by that firſt and univerſall motive principle, the will; ſo is not that firſt ſin layd to us, as ſeverall perſons, but as perſons and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals meeting in the ſame univerſall nature, total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at once by one man depraved.</p>
            <p>It is not, I confeſſe, the nature of poſitive Lawes to bind where they are not known or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61208:6"/>
ſo that if <hi>Cain</hi> had eaten of the forbidden fruit, <hi>Enoch</hi> his ſon had not therefore been borne a ſinner; but it pleaſed God, by a peculiar will, to wrap up all men in one <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe will ſhould be reputed as the will of all to come, whoſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie ſhould be our innocencie, whoſe ſin our ſin, though his repentance not our repentance. Let not duſt and aſhes wrangle and diſpute, how juſt this is, how much ſafer is it to reſt in his decree, at whoſe right hand, with the teſtimony of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, we proclaime that juſtice ſits enthroned, and in the infancie of time did ſit, when he examined nature in a true balance, and weighed out to all things their being, their properties, their places, their figures, with moſt exact conformitie to their exemplarie cauſe.</p>
            <p>So then you have ſeene how many came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the precincts of this prohibition, <hi>Thou ſhalt not eat,</hi> ſo many are guiltie of the breach of it, and ſo many are ſufferers. Now I proceed to the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: <hi>Democritus</hi> and the Epicure, whether flattering corrupt manners with promiſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punitie, or trembling to joyne wrath with omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, gave out, that God was not angrie at all, but that he ſate in Heaven a Diſpenſer of good things only: The Poet ſang of an age that knew not whether <hi>Iove</hi> could thunder or no, and wee have heard of an age, when God as yet had not entered into judgement with the ſons of men, when death had no more name, than it hath reall nature, when mans labour was his pleaſure, his

               </gap>, The very name of <hi>Troy</hi> is dolefull, how much more of Paradiſe, it adds to our miſery, ſince we have loſt the thing, to keep the name, which at this day ſounds no better, than to the Mariner ſome unhappy place in the ſea, famous of old for the notorious wrack of ſome goodly veſſell.</p>
            <p>Well, wee are now unparadiſed, turned out of our pleaſant walks, and muſt fall to our work, we muſt <hi>eat our bread in the ſweat of our face,</hi> this is our ſentence, wherein conſider, firſt the act, eating of bread; ſecondly, the qualification of this act, <hi>in ſweat of thy face.</hi> Man in his innocencie had not a body intrinſecally immortall, but a naturall and elementary body, compoſed of the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with ours, and uſing for the reparation of nature food, though not uſing the very ſame with us; hee was to eat, though not to eat in ſweat: And though he was not (as <hi>Suarez</hi> ſayes) in a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe to eat bread, by reaſon of the toyle in tillage, in ſowing, in reaping, in grinding, yet was hee, as the word is meant in my text, to eat bread, it being taken here for all manner of ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: and here I cannot paſſe by that ridiculous conceit of ſome Rabbins, who from this very word <hi>bread,</hi> doe gather that God condemned all men to jog after the plow, a thing which could not ſtand either with the nature of man, or with the wiſdome of God.</p>
            <p>I declare it thus: The light of nature, a beame

Shew mee but any thing of the moſt obſcure being, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires not to maintaine that being, and I ſhall the ſooner with the Egyptians believe two Gods that made the nature of things, the one good, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bad. Stay then, take notice, ſee and be ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed too, to ſee by what ſtrange wayes and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings the derived rivers become tributarie to the ſea, all things flow from the deep of divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſee how hee fetches them back againe, hee hath made them all, at leaſt by ſome analogie, to love him in that they love themſelves; for they are drops of the bucket, and ſo much as they love themſelves, which are by participation, ſo much they muſt needs love him, which is of himſelfe; they cannot love to bee, but they muſt love him who ſwallowes up in his infiniteneſſe of being, all being, whoſe nature and eſſence it is to be, let me tell you of a paradox, if there bee any in afflicted <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, that weep that they died not from the womb, that bleſſe the barren mother, and the paps that never gave ſuck, even theſe, the damned ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

and unhappie ſoules, out of a meere love to their being, deſire not to be: ſuch is our love to our being, and God himſelfe glories to ſay of himſelfe, <hi>I am,</hi> and yet this our being does death, as far as it can, deſtroy.</p>
            <p>Againe, can that bee the leaſt of evils, which drownes in teares the eyes of widdowes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans? that leaves the ſtreets as a green field, and changes the palaces of Princes into lodges of Bats and Owles, that had not God for a father, not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for a mother, till ſhe was adulterate? that is uſhered in by a thouſand evils, the ſword, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and famine, exceſſe in labour, exceſſe in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, lingring, griefe, and ſudden mirth, with a thouſand more.</p>
            <p>Now that death is a paſſage from theſe to a more bleſſed manſion, from theſe cloudy regions to thoſe enlightned by the Lord God, it is no thank to death, death is ſtill the ruine of Nature, the demoliſher of Gods Worke, this is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and power of God, who will raiſe us againe out of the duſt, and the dark grave, and then will bleſſe us, and ſhew us the light of his countenance, and ſay in the end of the world as hee ſaid in the beginning, let there be light, and there ſhall bee light; a light that no Cloud from thenceforth ſhall dim, that ſhall never ſet: to which light hee lighten us, who lighteth every man; nay who is that very light, and for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, our onely Lord and Saviour. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, of the act, <hi>Remember:</hi> But becauſe the memorie of any thing does of neceſſitie ſuppoſe the former knowledge of that, here comes in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other act, layd downe by way of ſuppoſition, that we know God: Firſt then of this ſuppoſed; <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premum in homine</hi> (ſayes <hi>S. Auguſt. de Civit. Dei) attingit ſupremum in mundo;</hi> The nobleſt faculty
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61208:15"/>
in the little world, man, reacheth to the nobleſt thing in the great world, God, the builder of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth. When God in the creation did ſtamp on the rude <hi>Chaos</hi> this face of method, hee was not laviſh of his owne image, he gave to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature an intellectuall ſoule, and became himſelfe the object of it: Hee hath not dealt ſo with everie nation, goe downe into the deep, and tell me if that ſcaly people have heard of the God of Hoſts, Doe they that dwell in the aire, thoſe winged Tribes, ſing Pſalmes to him that taught them, to him that made them? Doe the beaſts of the forreſt build him a Tabernacle? or the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars of Lebanon religiouſly bow their heads to him: No: they are not capable of ſo royall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, their portion is not fallen in ſo faire a place, they all move in ſhallower waters; only man, like the ſtately Pine, lanches out into the Maine, and moves upon that boundleſſe and bottomleſſe Ocean, the infinite and inviſible God.</p>
            <p>Now the knowledge of this God is two-fold, either revealed by Oracles, viſions, dreames, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Scripture, divided into the new or old Canon; or naturall, ſuch as the Heathen and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had by the bare light of reaſon, which though compared to ours, it was no more than the Glow-worme to the Sun, yet was enough to leave them inexcuſable, if according to that meaſure of knowledge, they did not honour the true God.</p>
            <p>The meanes by which they came to this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, was firſt by reflection on their owne ſoules.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61208:15"/>Secondly, by the unſatiable appetite of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which cannot reſt in any finite good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by the powerfull conſervation and upholding of all things: and here, O Lord, to whom ſhall I liken thee, either in heaven, or in earth? What Agent, either naturall or artificiall, is ſuch to his effect, as thou to the world? What the Sun produced by day, it leaves at night, and Arts, <gap reason="foreign">

Where is <hi>Minerva,</hi> the work and glorie of <hi>Phidias?</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> of <hi>Polycletus?</hi> Time hath razed their Temples, and like <hi>Metellus,</hi> when he took <hi>Athens,</hi> hath curſed the verie Gods in triumph. But of all the works of God, of all the parts of this great whole, there is not one miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, not one growne feeble with time, or that ſtoops to age. I have ſeene the heavens painted on <hi>Atlas</hi> his ſhoulders, but me thought he made a filthy ſowre face. There is one, and but one, ſufficient for this, hee that caſt the mountaines in their mold, and weighed them in a ballance, hee that ſtretcht forth the heavens as a curtaine, and ſpread them like a tent to dwell in.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, by the neat linking of cauſes with themſelves, and with their effects, by the voyce of the heavens; for their ſound is gone out into all lands, ſince their creation have they both day and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61208:16"/>
night preacht their Creatour, <hi>Non verborum, ſed rerum eloquentiâ,</hi> ſayes the Father, <hi>Not with elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of words, but of things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, in this great volume of Nature, what page ſoever they turned, they might (as in a faire print) read a God. So that to them that never ſaw the books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as Pagans and Heathens, who never read that in the beginning, God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the heaven and the earth, it will be damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not to know a God. For like as though God had never ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> or, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale,</hi> it had beene ſin to take that which is not a mans owne, or to ſhed mans bloud, becauſe the voyce of Nature cries loud againſt it (and therefore was <hi>Cain</hi> guiltie of murther, before the Law was given in <hi>Sinai</hi> againſt murther.) So though God had never revealed himſelfe, yet not to have knowne him, had beene inexcuſable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, uſually called in the Schoole, <hi>Ignorantia vincibilis, Ignorantia pravae diſpoſitionis, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia privativa:</hi> that is, the abſence of that knowledge, which though we have not, yet wee might, and ought to have had.</p>
            <p>But in us there can bee no ſuch ignorance, the night is paſt, and darkneſſe is no more upon the face of the earth, we all know him, wee ſpeake of him, wee ſing of him, wee confeſſe him with our pens, our words, our prayers, and daily oathes, when wee are but in our cradles, wee are taught to call God Father, and while wee hang on our
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61208:16"/>
mothers breaſts, to ſay, <hi>I beleeve in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe to know God, and proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is like <hi>Moſes</hi> from Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> to have a view of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but to dye before he could ſet foot in it, becauſe we know God as wee are men, but remember him as we are good men: therefore I now proceed from the ſuppoſed act, the knowledge of God, to that other explicite act, the remembrance of him.</p>
            <p>The good actions of men are of ſmall continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ceaſe to be ſo ſoone as their effect is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, like as naturall motion ceaſeth when the forme is produced. If they continue for any time, they may thank the memorie of poſteritie, that faithfully records the noble acts of her fathers, &amp; ſuffers not the ſame duſt that covers their bodies, to cover their names; by her they that dwell in the duſt live, and the bodies of Martyrs ſhall bleed a freſh to all generations; it is ſhe that writes good deeds with a pen of iron, and makes the acts of one age the hiſtorie and lecture of the next.</p>
            <p>Now in this reſpect doe men call for a <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> that ſeeing they themſelves have no long parts to act upon the ſtage of this world, when the time comes they muſt goe out, the curtaine be drawne, and they put off their upper clothes, their bodies, they may leave to this world their name behind them, to teſtifie that they themſelves had ſometime beene here: but in this reſpect cannot God require our remembrance of him, ſeeing that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61208:17"/>
what he is, hee hath beene from all eternitie, and ſo ſhall continue, when time ſhall bee no more. The reaſon why hee cals for our remembrance of him, is not any benefit that ſhall accrew to him; alas, how far is a creature, a ſilly man, a little quickened duſt, from adding to him, who if hee himſelfe could adde any thing to himſelfe, I would not acknowledge him my God; the fulneſſe of his perfection excludes all acceſſe of new, our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, our pſalmes, our remembrance of him doe him no good, <hi>Quòd colitur Deus, homini prodeſt, non Deo: neque enim fonti quiſpiam dixerit ſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuiſſe ſi biberit, nec ſoli, ſi viderit:</hi> If we do God ſervice, wee profit our ſelves, not God; for who will ſay, that the fountaine is beholden to him that quenches his thirſt at it; or the Sun to him that ſees by it. There is a ſervice, whoſe end is onely the benefit of him that rules, and this is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called ſervitude, and it was the lot of that impious ſon of <hi>Noah, Curſed is Cham, a ſervant of ſervants ſhall he be.</hi> Again, there is a ſervice where the benefit is partly his that rules, and partly his that is ruled, and ſuch a ſervice had hee in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, in whoſe behalfe the Centurion beſought Jeſus in this forme, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Lord, my boy lyes at home ſick of a palſie:</hi> And the Originall will beare, <hi>my child lyes at home ſick of a palſie.</hi> And ſuch a ſervice was that wee read of in Geneſis, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſed <hi>Eſau,</hi> that he might ſerve his brother. But now beyond both
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61208:17"/>
theſe, there is a relation of Lord and Servant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and Man, where the Lord reſerves to himſelfe onely honour, and puts over all the profit to us his ſervants; and yet though our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice be not good to him, but to our ſelves, it is his pleaſure and goodneſſe to require it; it is he that led the pen of <hi>Salomon,</hi> when he began this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as wee ſhould begin every day of the weeke, every day in the yeare, <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Creator is the object of our remembrance, and that firſt in this generall notion, as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: ſecondly in a ſpeciall as thy Creator: Firſt of the generall; the poore Philoſopher that knew no other, no better God than the Sunne, when he was asked for what he was borne, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to looke upon the Sun; though his ignorance was too too groſſe, in that he made a God of a Creature, adoring the Sun for him that inflamed the Sunne; yet had his ground beene true, had that beene a God which he ſuppoſed to be a god, how worthy had his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer beene, to be ſent in Letters of gold to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, to read and practiſe: bee it what it will, 'tis writ againſt us, and ſhall be read againſt us at the great accounts, if knowing the true God, we denie him in our lives.</p>
            <p>Of all thoſe Acts by which Almighty God communicates himſelfe to the Creature, hee is moſt viſible in his act of Creation, as for his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61208:18"/>
acts of executive providence, though they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually certaine, yet they are not equally ſeene: it was the ignorance of thoſe that puzled the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picure, and drove him to his wits end, to finde out, why all things come alike to all, to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not, why the thunder-bolt ſhould paſſe a Taverne and fire a Temple; why the Foxes ſhould have holes, and the Birds of the aire neſts, but humility and ſimplicity not where to lay their head: which knot when he had thus tyed, but could not untie, hee deſperately broke it, and peremptorily ſets downe, that there was a God in heaven: but he, a careleſſe and ſleepy one, wherein in that he took away from him providence, hee indeed left him no God: not much unlike the <hi>Cretians,</hi> that call their god <hi>Iove</hi> immortall, yet talke of his Tomb with this inſcription, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Here lies <hi>Iove</hi> the Son of <hi>Saturne;</hi> but his act of Creation, he that ſees it not muſt needs be guiltie of damnable ignorance, of voluntarie and affected ignorance, and ſeems to have his eye-lids given him for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to ſhut out day; and therefore this remembrance of God is rather urged from his act of Creation, than from his act of Providence.</p>
            <p>There is a ſecond reaſon which may claime our remembrance of him, and that is the extent of his goodneſſe in this act of Creation; before heaven or earth, before day or night had God beene of eternall, and infinite continuance, he was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61208:18"/>
then alone, ſolitarie, yet wanted no company: it is not with him, as with man, whoſe naturall infirmities breed a naturall, and neceſſary deſire of ſociety: hence ſays <hi>Solomon,</hi> two are better than one, neither wanted he the earth for a foot-ſtoole: to want a foot-ſtoole is proper to bodies, to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary and groſſe bodies; neither wanted hee a houſe to dwell in, for then he ſhould want it now: For behold the heaven of heavens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines him not: and yet for all this it pleaſed him to create an heaven and earth, the one for thy Footſtoole, the other for thy Canopy, both of them of rare beauty, of wonderfull continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, of ſuch perfection, that to them, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſayes, no man can add, and from them can no man diminiſh, unleſſe it be ſome one ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly curious, as he in <hi>Lucian,</hi> that blamed him firſt for making a woman: ſecondly, for placing the Bulls hornes above his eyes.</p>
            <p>But becauſe no efficient acts at randome, but has reſpect to ſome end which either it ſelfe tends to, but apprehends not, as it is in all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low man, or which it ſelfe both tends to and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends, as it is in all intellectual agents, and chiefely in the firſt, the infinite wiſe God; who therefore in the Theologie of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the firſt intelligence: take further notice of the end for which hee became a Creator, and then unleſſe thou be more ſtupid than <hi>Cluſius Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus,</hi> that could never hit of <hi>Hectors</hi> Name, or

            <p>Thus much of the object in generall, as the Creator: I now come to the object in a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall notion, with this reſtraint or appropriation, <hi>thy Creator:</hi> where waſt thou when I laid the foundation of the earth, (ſaies God to <hi>Iob)</hi> let the Poet make anſwer, <hi>quâ non nata jacent,</hi> were things that are not yet borne or conceived are,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61208:21"/>
that is juſt no where: how much then doſt thou owe to God that gave thee life, when as yet thou couldſt not aske it of him? and when hee firſt gave thee life, thou waſt as thy dayes are, but a ſpan long, and yet what a faire place did he make ready for thee? even the wide and ſpacious world, that when thou commeſt to yeares and mans ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thou mighteſt have elbow roome enough.</p>
            <p>That God is the Creator, and therefore Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, is matter of feare and trembling, but that he is thy Creator is matter of love, and thankfull remembrance. Did he not give thee a being? yes, but ſo he did to ſtocks and ſtones. Did hee not give thee a ſoule and life? thus much hee hath done for beaſts and trees. But did hee not give thee a reaſonable ſoule? to denie it were the beſt argument, that hee did not. But in that hee hath given thee a reaſonable ſoule, remember this thing that he hath done for thee: The ſoule of Beaſts is from the earth, earthly; the ſoule of man from the Father of Spirits, and is ſpirituall; the ſoule of Beaſts is but for a time, and then dyes with the body, the ſoule of man lives after the body, and returnes to God that gave it.</p>
            <p>Some of the old Philoſophers compare the ſoule of a man to a Circle; for like as a Circle returnes to the firſt poynt, and ends where it began, ſo the ſoule of man returnes to God from whom it began: to which may that bee well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed which God ſayes of himfelfe, <hi>J am the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61208:21"/>
beginning, and I am the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now though it bee true that the wiſe men ſaid of old, that the ſoule of man doth reſemble a circle; yet is there ſome diſparitie and unlikeneſſe in the one and the other; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Circle returnes to the poynt from whence it begins, but every mans ſoule doth not returne to God that gave it: for the ſouls of the wicked go out from him, and are loſt in this world, and never returne to him againe: but the ſoules of the juſt are like the Dove which <hi>Noah</hi> ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

In this doe the ſoules of good and bad agree, that they were all created by one and the ſame God, that they are all for a time to be united to the body, that they ſhall all at the end of that time be ſeparated from the body, that they ſhall all put on the very ſame bodies which ſometimes they put off; that they ſhall all come to judgement; and here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes the woefull and lamentable difference, ſome proving Chaffe, ſome Wheat; ſome Sheep, ſome Goats ſome being ſet on the right hand, and ſome on the left; ſome marked out to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death, and ſome to eternall life: now that thou maiſt never feele the happineſſe of the one, and never feele the miſerie of the other, take with thee this Counſell, it is the Counſell of a King, of <hi>Solomon</hi> the King, let it bee to thee as the

Signet of thy right hand, and as Jewells of gold about thy neck; write it upon the Nayles of thy fingers, upon the palmes of thine hands, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poſts of thine houſe, and in every corner of thy heart, <hi>Remember thy Creator.</hi> The fruit that will ſpring from this remembrance, will be much and rare: from contemplation of his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and thy low eſtate will ſpring humilitie, from thought of this, that hee gave to thee not onely when thou hadſt nothing, but waſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Charlie to the poore, from his mercie hope, from his Iuſtice a true ballance; feare of his Name, reſolution ard contempt of injuries, from his immenſitie and illimited preſence in all places, watch fulneſſe and warineſſe in all thy ways, words, and actions.</p>
            <p>But becauſe there is an appoynted time for all things, a time for everie purpoſe under the Sun, my Text does not only ſet downe whom we muſt remember, but the time when we muſt remember him, and that in three particulars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, in our youth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in the dayes of our youth;</p>
            <p>Thirdly, now in the dayes of our youth,</p>
            <p>Firſt of the firſt. It was the ſuperſtition of the old Romans, <hi>primam lanuginem Diis Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crare,</hi> to conſecrate the firſt haire of their cheeks to their gods: what was ſuperſtition in them, will bee good Religion in us, God will have our firſtlings; what are they? the firſt borne male

of thy Cattell, and of thy ſheep, thou ſhalt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie to the Lord thy God, was the old Law. But now, I will take no Bullock out of thine houſe, nor Goat out of thy fold: will I eate the fleſh of Bulls, or drinke the blood of Goats? Offer unto mee praiſe, and pay thy vowes, call upon mee (but marke what followes) in the day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not in the night, not after Sunne ſet, wee muſt not deferre it ſo long; and I ſay, call upon him early, betime in the morning; and if not in the morning of the day, yet ſurely in the morning of thine age, that is, in thy youth. How many have thought to call in the evening, who have beene cald away themſelves at noone, and beene benighted at mid-day? for we are here but for a time, and then muſt bee gone: like Travailers, or wayfaring men, wee muſt pay our debt and reckoning to Nature, and then away; after we have eat and drunke here, or like Tenants at will, who muſt give up our Title and Land, even that ſmall portion of earth which we carry about us, when God ſhall call, as hee cald to <hi>Abraham, exi de terratua,</hi> goe out of thy Land: and whither then? to the place that <hi>Iob</hi> in his tenth Chapter ſpeaks of, darke as darkneſſe it ſelfe; where there is no order; where there is no place for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, for as the tree falleth ſo it lyeth.

Times and ages, God, as a wiſe diſpenſer has kept in his owne hands, to the intent that wee might ſuſpect a ſhorter thred of life, and yet not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of a longer.</p>
            <p>There is a time to be borne, and a time to dye (ſayes <hi>Solomon)</hi> marke his language, here is birth and death, but no talke of life; as if in a new way of Philoſophy, he would make a paſſage <hi>ab extremo, ad extremum ſine medio,</hi> as if wee were to ſpring immediately out of our mothers wombe, out of our ſwadling Clouts into our winding ſheet.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe it were ſo, that thou hadſt a long leaſe of thy life, and wert forc't to go to thy grave as a ſheafe of Wheat into the Barne, ripe and in a good age: ſuppoſe thou hadſt a promiſe to ſee thy childrens children, and their Children, yet were it extreame impiety to deferre thy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

to thy later dayes, to give thy beautie and youth to thy pleaſure, and thy wrinckles and gray haires to thy God. Haſt thou not read, hath it not beene told thee, that God will have no pleaſure in thy leavings, the halt, the lame, the bleare-eyed, and the blind, are theſe fit offerings on his Altar?</p>
            <p>Beſides, how unjuſt is this, to play away the ſtrength of thine age, and then to lay the burden of all thy ſinnes upon thy old and decrepit age, which God knowes is a burden to it ſelfe, whoſe knees tremble and ſhake under as many diſeaſes as ſinnes. O Lord, that back that ſo ſtoops un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der threeſcore yeares, how ſhall it ſinke under the ſins of threeſcore yeares? the ſinnes, I ſay, whoſe weight hee full well knowes, that calls to us, <hi>Come unto mee all you that are heavie laden;</hi> for this I call heaven, and earth, and hell to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for the earth ſunk under the ſins of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram:</hi> the firſt ſinne weighed the apoſtate Angels to hell; and now is another hell to them, and the ſinne of man weighed downe from heaven to earth: The Son of God, who on the Mount of Olives ſweat drops of bloud, under the load of our iniquities, and when hee bare them on the Croſſe, hee cryed out in the anguiſh of his ſoule, heaven and earth beway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the extreame weight that lay upon him, for the Sunne ſhut his eye, and the whole Land of <hi>Iurie</hi> became as a cloſe mourner; for it was

wrapt in a blacke Mantle of Darkneſſe from the ſixt even unto the ninth houre: is this then a burthen for thine old age? for crazie and faint limbes? then let a Pigmie, a Dwarfe, twitch up Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> at the roots, and ſtrut away with it on his ſhoulders.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, doe but thinke of the many and certaine miſeries of that age; <hi>Nonius Marcellus</hi> coats three places out of <hi>Aecius, Pacuvius,</hi> and <hi>Titinnius,</hi> where <hi>ſenium</hi> is put for <hi>Malum,</hi> as if it were one and the ſame thing to be old and miſerable: adde hither the decay of Senſes, conſcience of an ill-acted life, the feare to dye, and yet wearineſſe to live, with <hi>Chiliads,</hi> and <hi>Iliads,</hi> more of evills, Miniſters to the firſt, I tremble to ſay the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death.</p>
            <p>Beyond all this, there are ſome vices natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to old age, as jealouſie, peeviſhneſſe, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſitie, loquacitie; their preſent life being but a vaine repetition or memorie of their former, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which is the Philoſophers one Reaſon in 2. of his <hi>Rhetor.</hi> becauſe old men by experience beſt know how neceſſary thoſe eternalls are, and yet how hardly got, how eaſily loſt: This is that, that makes them, when they are even at their journies end, breake their Aſſes backs with laying on new proviſion, not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Rivers, that then runne biggeſt, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt waters, when they come neareſt to the Sea, to their owne home.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, how hardly does gray-headed ſinne leave a ſinner? This is that Aegyptian Tyrant, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that will not let Iſrael goe: it is continuance in ſinne, that makes an earneſt ſinner, our firſt ſinnes are with ſome reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy, ſome checks, ſome gripes, our later with delight; happy is hee that daſhes thoſe Brats, thoſe little ones, againſt the Stone, as it is in <hi>Pſalme</hi> one hundred thirtie ſixe. Some Interpreters by little one, doe there, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſinne in its Infancy, and by the Stone the Rock, the Corner ſtone, CHRIST JESUS.</p>
            <p>How hardly is the iniquity of our Heeles ſhooke off? <hi>Caſſiodorus</hi> expounds our Heeles our later Age, and the difficultie proceeds
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61208:26"/>
partly from the Devill, to <hi>inſidiaberis calcaneo,</hi> ſaid God to the Serpent, thou ſhalt lye in wait for his Heele; partly from the ſinner, hee is an old, a grave ſinner, hardly cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; not as if the Balme of <hi>Gilead</hi> failed, not as if GOD wanted mercie, for he ran to meet the Prodigall afarre off, and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with twelve Gates open, to the Eaſt three, to the Weſt three, to the North three, and to the South three: but becauſe God in Iuſtice hardens ſuch ſinners, not poſitively, but negatively, that is, <hi>Non impertiendo mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, ſed non impertiendo gratiam,</hi> ſayes <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,</hi> not by making them evill, but by not making them good, leaving them ſtupid, bed-ridden, and ſpeechleſſe ſinners, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſence, without motion, not able to doe or ſay ſo much as the Prodigall did, I will riſe, or I would riſe, and goe to my Father.</p>
            <p>Hence now I paſſe to the ſecond particular, <hi>In the dayes of thy youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why in the dayes of our youth, more than in the yeares of our youth: They that have ſet us out the ſhorteſt time for youth, allow us from foureteene to thirtie foure, but this is to put us in minde of uncertaintie of life, as if our youth was but for a few dayes, or like as at the end of the day comes evening, and then darke night, ſo at the end of our youth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61208:26"/>
comes old Age, and then Death.</p>
            <p>Or it may bee without violence to the Text, you may take in the dayes of thy youth; for, by the good actions done in thy youth, and then the ſenſe will bee, give teſtimonie that thou Remembreſt thy Creator, by thy well-doing, in thy youth; for ſo may this word <hi>Dayes</hi> bee uſed: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> (ſaid <hi>Moſes)</hi> departed full of daies, <hi>Hooeſt</hi> (ſayes <hi>Aquinas) plenus operibus lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis &amp; diei:</hi> Neither doe I without warrant expound this Prepoſition <hi>in</hi> as a cauſall, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying <hi>by;</hi> ſo would ſome have it meant in the verie firſt word of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and ſo it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Pſalme, <hi>In wiſedome haſt thou made them all:</hi> that is, <hi>by wilſedome;</hi> for the Son is the wiſedome of the Father: And ſo is it uſed in the firſt of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, hee ſpake to us in his Sonne, that is, by his Son.</p>
            <p>Thus I have done with the ſecond par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <hi>In the dayes of thy youth.</hi> But that is not enough, the wiſe man addes, <hi>now in the dayes of thy youth.</hi> I ſay now: for now is the Sabboth Day, to the hallowing of which, GOD prefixt, as hee did to my Text, a <hi>Remember,</hi> Remember that thou keep holy the Sabboth day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, remember him now, becauſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61208:27"/>
no time is thine, but this verie now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any bee to come it is uncertaine; and what it may bring with it as uncertaine: That which is paſt is behinde thee, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou art a Travailer on earth, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou journyeſt, the further thou lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Rememeber thy Creator now,</hi> becauſe now, in this very moment, this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Article of time, does he create thy bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, thy ſoule: for by the verie ſame action by which it was firſt created, is it till this day created, is this minute created, and ſhall bee created to all eternitie, (miſtake mee not) the Conſervation of it in being, being nothing elſe but the Creation of it continued: ſince therefore, God upholds thy ſoule in being by the ſame act, by which hee gave it being (I meane thy ſoule onely, for hee did not in a proper ſence create thy bodie) and ſince no cauſe loſeth its Name, or Formalitie, till its actuall influence, or cauſalitie ceaſe: who ſees not that when ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hee did firſt create it, yet he now creates it: hee is now thy Creator, therefore thou ſhalt now remember him: if he be thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, thou muſt make him thy end: the firſt efficient, and the laſt end muſt needes bee co-incident: if hee doe for thee, thou
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61208:27"/>
muſt doe for him; if hee now remember thee, thou muſt not now forget him; becauſe thou waſt at firſt deduced from him, thou muſt bee thus reduced to him. <hi>Alcinous</hi> in his Introduction to <hi>Plato</hi> ſayes of him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, hee held GOD of a Sphaericall figure: and truely, though God bee of no figure, yet (to omit many inſtances) hee ſeemes to love this figure: for as a Circle returnes into it ſelfe, and ends where it began; ſo all things that were derived from him, (and what was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him?) muſt end in him: <hi>Iſter, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelous, Euphrates,</hi> and <hi>Ganges,</hi> all theſe Rivers flow from that mightie Well: and after all their windings, come to pay tribute, and fall with a loud noyſe into that mightie Well.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, Remember you eſpecially your Creator now, becauſe there was of late evill in your great Citie, the evill of Plague, but now is not, becauſe the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant hath now laid by his Quiver, his Bow, and his Arrowes, becauſe ſhee that did ſit in Aſhes, is now become the glorie of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the ſeat of joy, of mirth, and health; becauſe now her ſtreets, her Courts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice her Temples are returned from ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to their old frequencie, becauſe now
