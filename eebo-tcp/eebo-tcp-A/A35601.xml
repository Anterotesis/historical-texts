            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Fountaine</hi> often <hi>demanded</hi> the Money of Sir <hi>Rob. Holt,</hi> and was by him in ſeveral Letters (which will be produc'd to this Honorable Houſe) ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired to give him <hi>further time</hi> for the payment of the Money.</p>

               </gap>, ſum or ſums of Money before receiv'd, and of <hi>all</hi> demands whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Theſe Releaſes were given not only out of that <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> which Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> always bore and expreſs'd to Mr. <hi>Fountaine</hi> for his former kindneſſes to him in his Extremities, and for his Subſiſtance upon him, and for ſaving his Life in the time of his Travels; but were granted likewiſe upon <hi>good Conſiderations</hi> in lieu and ſatisfaction of the Arrears of a Rent-charge of 1000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> due to Mr. <hi>Fountaine</hi> out of Mr. <hi>Coke</hi>'s Eſtate, of which no demand had been made for ſeveral years.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> was ſo far during his life from pretending to have any intereſt in <hi>Holt</hi>'s Mortgage, that upon Mr. <hi>Fountaine</hi>'s Marriage with a Kinſwoman of <hi>Coke</hi>'s, <hi>Holt</hi>'s Security with the reſt, were (with <hi>Coke</hi>'s privity) ſetled on the Wife and Children of that Marriage. And albeit a miſunderſtanding was a little before Mr <hi>Coke</hi>'s death created between him and Mr. <hi>Fountaine</hi> by the ill means of <hi>Gwavas,</hi> and the differences referr'd to Council to ſettle, yet Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> did not in the leaſt pretend to any intereſt in this debt, tho he and <hi>Gwavas</hi> then endeavour'd to take all advantages againſt Mr. <hi>Fountaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And immediately before Mr. <hi>Coke</hi>'s death, <hi>Gwavas</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> were ſo conſcious, that Mr. <hi>Fountaine</hi> was both in <hi>deed</hi> and <hi>intention</hi> diſcharg'd by the ſaid Relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of all ſums within that time; that he did therefore make proviſion out of the <hi>real</hi> Eſtate for payment of Debts and Legacies; and neither claim'd nor expected any advantage from this Mortgage.</p>
            <p>And afterwards, it was upon <hi>Rob. Coke</hi>'s Bill, order'd, in <hi>Chancery,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Fountaine</hi> ſhould not inſiſt on the Arrears, during Mr. <hi>Coke</hi>'s life, in reſpect of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies diſcharg'd by the ſaid Releaſes.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, afterwards in the Exchequer, <hi>without any Tryal at Law and pending an Appeal,</hi> without any Declaration or Proof of a Truſt; and notwithſtanding the ſaid Releaſes, and no pretence ever made in <hi>Coke</hi>'s life time; and notwithſtanding a Judgment againſt <hi>Holt</hi> in <hi>Coke</hi>'s life-time for Mr. <hi>Fountaine,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coke</hi>'s privity thereto, and to the Settlement on Mr. <hi>Fountaine</hi>'s Marriage; it was Decreed that Mr. <hi>Fountaine</hi> was only a Truſtee for Mr. <hi>Coke;</hi> and the Court of Exchequer, <hi>contrary to all former practice,</hi> took upon them to ſend out a <hi>Sequeſtration</hi> upon this Decree.</p>
            <p>When afterwards upon Appeals to the Lords the Decree of the Exchequer was confirm'd, (except as to <hi>Holt</hi>'s 5000 <hi>l.</hi>) A Tryal at Law was touching this Debt directed by their Lordſhips, and the Iſſue directed was, Whether the ſaid 5000 <hi>l.</hi> or any part of it, was the Money of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> at the loan thereof, and whether Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> at any time after the Loan thereof, gave the ſame to Mr. <hi>Fountaine?</hi> And Mr. <hi>Fountain</hi> provided for the Tryal accordingly.</p>
            <p>But afterwards before the ſaid Tryal, upon the 24th of <hi>Apr.</hi> 1690, in another Parliament without any new Petition or Hearing at Bar, and without any Notice given to Mr. <hi>Fountaine,</hi> upon a motion made at the <hi>Riſing</hi> of the Houſe, there was a new Order made by the <hi>major</hi> part of ſuch of the Lords as were <hi>then</hi> preſent, and a new Iſſue was directed, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> at any time after the Loan thereof, gave the ſame to Mr. <hi>Fountaine</hi> by any other Deed or Writing <hi>than by the Releaſes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Iſſue was thus alter'd: And all that defence at the Tryal, which both by the Court of Exchequer, and their Lordſhips former Judgment was allow'd to Mr. <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> was wholly taken away, ſo that by theſe Proceedings, and the Sequeſtration, not only the Rent-charge of 1000 <hi>l. per an.</hi> out of Mr. <hi>Cokes</hi> Eſtate, adjudg'd to Mr. <hi>Fountaine</hi> in all Courts whatſoever; but his <hi>paternal</hi> Eſtate, and the Fortunes he had with <hi>two Wives</hi> amounting to 10000 <hi>l.</hi> that is, all his Eſtate Real and Perſonal, the produces thereof were without any <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> or <hi>allowance</hi> for the Arrears of the Rent-charge hitherto wav'd in lieu of the ſaid moneys, and which would go far in diſcharge of the Decree; and without any <hi>proviſion</hi> for Mr. <hi>Fountaines</hi> Wife and Children, by <hi>colour</hi> of the ſaid Decree and Order, <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>entirely</hi> ſequeſtred to the uſe of the GUARDIAN of Mr. <hi>Coke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Seſſion a Bill is brought in <hi>under the name</hi> of Sir <hi>Cha. Holt.</hi> The Scope of which is that, in purſuance of the ſaid Decree, thus affirm'd by this Order of the Houſe of Lords, the money due to Mr. <hi>Fountaine,</hi> may be paid to the GUARDIAN of Mr. <hi>Coke;</hi> and upon that payment the Acts, Releaſes, Diſcharges, and Reconveyances of the Truſtees therein named, ſhall be deem'd, adjudg'd, and enacted, to be the Act, Releaſes, Diſcharges, and Reconveyances of Mr. <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fountaine</hi> being very deſirous to eaſe Sir <hi>Cha. Holt</hi> by all methods imaginable in his power, made Propoſals to him for <hi>contracting</hi> the ſecurity, and offer'd, after the diſcharge of all other incumbred Lands, to have <hi>ſo much</hi> Land <hi>only</hi> ſubject to his Mortgage, and to his Recognizance, as would, upon a purchaſe, after an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſtated, <hi>anſwer</hi> the Debt. By which means Sir <hi>Cha. Holt</hi> who deſign'd a Sale of this part of his Eſtate, would be wholly reliev'd; And the Claims of the preſent pretenders, kept on foot, and the Land remain as a Stake to attend the preſent Order in, and the final iſſue of this Cauſe.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as theſe <hi>reaſonable</hi> Propoſals were, upon what grounds is not known, refus'd by Sir <hi>Cha. Holt,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cokes</hi> Counſel; And foraſmuch as this Bill <hi>not only</hi> ſets aſide all thoſe legal Aſſurances and Conveyances, which are the only Supports and Evidences of Mr. <hi>Fountaines</hi> Title, <hi>but alſo</hi> wholly precludes him from any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of any future relief; and foraſmuch as Sequeſtration, under which he lies, is of the <hi>firſt Impreſſion,</hi> and <hi>without Precedent,</hi> and that this <hi>ſuppos'd</hi> Intereſt of Mr. <hi>Coke</hi> ariſes not from an <hi>expreſs,</hi> but an <hi>imply'd</hi> Truſt, and a Truſt which is only <hi>preſum'd</hi> by the Court of Exchequer, and not <hi>found</hi> by a Jury upon <hi>proof:</hi> And foraſmuch as the ſaid Mr. <hi>Fountaine</hi> deſign'd to have a Tryal at Law, (if the ſaid Order had not in great meaſure debarr'd him from his defence,) and <hi>now</hi> deſires nothing more, than that his Cauſe may be referr'd to a <hi>Jury,</hi> and determin'd by a <hi>Verdict:</hi> And foraſmuch as the Settlements on Mr. <hi>Fountaines</hi> Wife, made on <hi>valuable conſiderations,</hi> will, by the conſequences of this Bill, be defeated, and his whole Family intirely ruin'd, without any hope of remedy. It is hop'd and humbly pray'd, that this whole matter, being of very great conſequence, may be heard by the Honourable Houſe of Commons, before any further procedure upon this Bill.</p>
