         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I then by the blessing of God, (as I have many other times done) maintained heat in it by the help of a kind of stone which I find to be apt to receive heat much sooner, and likewise to retain it much longer then any other thing, which I could find upon any reason or trial. For I found clothes heated by the fire would quickly lose their warmth; and likewise boards could not retain their heat long; and that Brick and Free stone required much time to heat them, and held it but a little while; and that other stones were not able to endure strong heating, but would suddenly fly in pieces, whereas this stone being well seasoned at the first, with a moderate heat will both receive it quickly and keep it very long,<note place="margin">To heat the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>One of my neighbours who had been long weak and sickly; and newly had her old grief and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness much increased by the loss of her eldest son, when with all the help that she could get by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, in a long night she could take little rest; by the warmth of these stones, the one being applied to her feet, and the other to the bottome of her Belly, she found more ease and sounder sleep, then she could do at any time in a quarter of a year before. And she told me that when her maid had forgotten (after an eight or ten dayes using thereof) to provide this help for her, she slept as ill, as she was wont to do before; but now (God be praised) is very well amended in health and strength. The same party also being extreamly weakned with such a grievous pain in her back, as she was neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to go nor stand, &amp; told her husband that if it should continue with her but three days she thought verily it would cost her life; by applying these Warming-stones to the place grieved, with in three hours was able to walk about her chamber, at which her Husband told me he marvelled much how so great an alteration should be wrought in so short a time.

            <p>Another likewise having so grievous a pain in his back, as that it forced him to keep his bed, was by the help of this stone cured thereof. (<hi>And of</hi> Arthur Masters <hi>of the same Parish.</hi>

            <p>And another also though his pain therein was so great, as it so much weakned his body, as he was not able to turn in his bed, was by the same means speedily cured; and very many others whom for brevity sake I forbear to mention.<note place="margin">Rupture.</note> (<hi>Help to bring in again the Rupture of Mr.</hi> Simon Row <hi>and another of</hi> Antony <hi>aforesaid.</hi>)</p>
