         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing finiſhed (Right worſhipfull) and made ready for the Preſſe this little Dialogue: I bethought me (ſith the common maner of all, that write any bookes in this age, is to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cát the ſame to one or to other of great place) to whom I might dedicate theſe my poore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.

<pb facs="tcp:13922:3"/>
none to be more fit then your worſhip: both in regard of ſome affinity in the fleſh, as alſo becauſe of thoſe manifold good parts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Almighty hath endued you. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing therefore none other thing to preſent your worſhip withall (in token of a thankfull heart for your curteſies ſhewed towards me) behold, I doe heere ſend vnto you this third fruite of my labours now publiſhed. Moſt humbly beſeeching you to take it in good worth: not weighing the value of the thing, which is of no value, but the ſimple and good minde and meaning of the giuer. This worke doth ſharply reproue and euict the world of ſinne, and therefore is like to find many dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemies, which with cruell hatred will moſt eagerly purſue it vnto death. <hi>Zoilus</hi> alſo and his fellowes, I know, will bitterly carpe at it. Therefore it flieth vnto your Worſhip for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and humbly deſireth to take Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary vnder your wings. Wherefore I humbly intreat you to take vpon you the patronage and defence of it: that by your meanes it may be deliuered both from the calumnious oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies of euill diſpoſed perſons, and alſo from
<pb facs="tcp:13922:3"/>
the worlds malignity; ſo as it may take no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury. And concerning this little volume, the ſumme of the matter of it, you ſhall finde in the Epiſtle to the Reader. As concerning the manner, heere is no great matter in learning, wit, arte, eloquence, or ingenious inuention: (for I haue heerein ſpecially reſpected the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and vulgar ſort, whoſe edification I doe chiefely aime at) yet ſomewhat there is, which may concern the learned, &amp; giue them ſome contentment. Whatſoeuer it be, I leaue it with your Worſhip, beſeeching you to giue it entertainement. And ſo I doe moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly take my leaue: commending both your ſelfe, your good wife, and your whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the mercifull protection of the euerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God.

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, ſeeing my little Sermon of Repentance, ſome few yeeres ſince publiſhed, hath beene ſo well accepted of: I haue, for thy further good pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed this Dialogue, being the third fruit of my labour: wiſhing to it the like ſucceſſe, that God thereby may haue the glory, and thou who art the Reader comfort. I haue, in one part of this Dialogue, produced ſome of the ancient writers, and ſome of the wiſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then alſo, to teſtifie vpon their oath in their owne language, and to beare witneſſe of the vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of ſome vices, which we in this age make light of: which I wiſh may not be offenſiue to any. In other parts of this worke, I do in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner relinquiſh them. But in this caſe I haue in my weake iudgement, thought them to be of ſome good vſe, to ſhew forth thus much: that if
<pb facs="tcp:13922:4"/>
we doe not in time repent, forſake our ſinnes, &amp; ſeeke after God, both the auncient Chriſtian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (whoſe eies ſaw not that we ſee, nor their eares heard that we heare) yea the very Heathen alſo ſhall riſe vp in iudgement againſt vs. Let none therefore ſtumble at it. But if any doe, let them remember I am in a Dialogue, not in a Sermon. I write to all of all ſorts: I ſpeake not to ſome few of one ſort. But that which is done herein, is not much more then that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (<hi>As ſome of your own Poets haue ſaid, Act.</hi> 17.) which is warrantable. One thing, deare Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, I pray thee let me beg of thee; to wit, that thou wouldeſt not reade two or three leaues of this Booke, and ſo caſt it from thee: but that thou wouldeſt reade it throughout euen to the end. For I do aſſure thee, if there be any thing in it worth the reading, it is beſtowed in the latter part thereof, and moſt of all towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. Be not diſcouraged therefore at the harſhneſſe of the beginning: but looke for ſmoother matter in the middeſt, and moſt ſmooth in the percloſe and wind-vp of all. For this Dialogue hath in it, not the nature of a Tragedy, which is begunne with ioy, and ended with ſorrow: but of a Comedie, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with ſorrow, and ended with ioy. This booke medleth not at all with any controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in the Church, or any thing in the ſtate Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall,
<pb facs="tcp:13922:5"/>
but onely entreth into a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie with Sathan and ſinne. It is contriued into ſix principall heads. Firſt, it ſheweth mans miſery in nature, with the meanes of recouery. Secondly, it ſharpely inueigheth againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity of the time, and common corruptions of the world. Thirdly, it ſheweth the markes of the children of God, and of the Reprobates; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the apparant ſignes of ſaluation and damnation. Fourthly, it declareth how hard a thing it is to enter into life: and how few ſhall enter. Fiftly, it laieth open the ignorance of the world, with the obiections of the ſame. Laſt of all, it publiſheth and proclaimeth the ſweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpell, with the abundant mercy of God, to all that repent, beleeue, and truely turne vnto him. The Authour of all bleſſing giue a bleſſing vnto it. The God of peace, which brought againe from the dead our Lord Ieſus, the great ſheepeheard of the ſheepe, through the blood of the euerlaſting couenant, make vs perfect in all good workes, ſanctifie vs throughout, amend all our imperfections, and keepe vs blameleſſe vntill the day of his moſt glorious appearing, Amen.</p>

               <p>Indeed ſir, we haue ſome little bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines; for we came to talke with one of your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, about a Cow we ſhould buy of him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Antile.</speaker>
               <p>A good Cow indeed, at this time of the yere, is worth very nere foure pound, which is a great price.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>No ſir, we are in no great haſte, we can ſtay two or three houres, for the dayes are long; if we diſpatch our buſineſſe by night it will ſerue our turne well enough.</p>

               <p>In the ſtate of condemnation, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 3. We are by nature the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath as well as others.

               <p>Is it euery mans caſe? Are not Dukes and Nobles, Lords and Ladies, and the great Potentates of the earth exempted from it?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>From the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> who thereby hath not onely wrapt himſelfe, but all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, in extreame and vnſpeakeable miſery; as the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>By one mans diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, many were made ſinners:</hi> and <hi>by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one, the fault came on all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>What reaſon is there that we all ſhould thus be puniſhed for an other mans offence?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe we were then all in him, and are now all of him: that is, we are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended out of his loynes, that of him we haue not only receiued our naturall and corrupt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but alſo by propagation haue inherited his foule corruptions, as it were by hereditary right.</p>

               <p>But foraſmuch as ſome haue dreamed that <hi>Adam</hi> by his fall hurt himſelfe only, and not his poſterity; and that we haue his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deriued vnto vs by imitation, and not by propagation: therefore I pray you ſhew this more plainely.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Euen as great perſonages, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of treaſon, doe not onely hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13922:8"/>
but alſo ſtaine their blood, and diſgrace their poſteritie: for the children of ſuch Nobles are diſinherited, whoſe blood is attainted; till they be reſtored againe by act of Parliament.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Yes truely, it is vniuerſall, extending<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 1. Col. 1. 21.

            <sp>

               <p>Not of the deadneſſe of the bodie, or the naturall faculties of the ſoule, but of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall faculties.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>Did Adam then loſe his nature and deſtroy it by his fall? or is our nature taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by his fall?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Not ſo. Our nature was corrupted thereby, but not deſtroyed: for ſtill there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in our nature, reaſon, vnderſtanding, will, and affections, and we are not as a block, or a ſtocke; but by <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience wee are blemiſhed, maimed, and ſpoyled of all abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to vnderſtand aright, or to will and doe

aright. As it is written: <hi>Wee are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of our ſelues, to thinke any thing as of our<note place="margin">2.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>I thinke ſo indéed: and it may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare vnto vs in the wiſe ſpéeches and writings of Heathen Poets and Philoſophers: in all which wée may, as by certaine ruines, perceiue what was the excellent frame and building of mans creation.</p>

               <p>No, not in any thing: for till wée be in the ſtate of grace, euen our beſt actions are ſinfull: as preaching, prayer, almes déeds, &amp;c. As it is written: <hi>Who can bring a cleane thing</hi>

And our Lord Jeſus himſelfe ſaith: <hi>Doe men gather Grapes of<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 16.</note> thornes, or Figges of thiſtles?</hi> Meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that méere naturall men can bring foorth no fruites acceptable to God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>This is a very harſh and hard ſaying; I pray you for my further inſtruction, make it more plaine.</p>

               <p>Men in the ſtate of nature may doe thoſe things which of themſelues are good, but they doe vtterly faile in the manner of doing them: they do them not as they ſhould be done: that is, in faith, loue, zeale, conſcience of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp;c. neither yet with any chéerefulneſſe, delight or feeling, but euen as it were, forcing themſelues to doe the outward actions. Thus did <hi>Cain</hi> ſacrifice; the Phariſies pray; <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> giue almes; and the Jewes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp their oblations and burnt offerings.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>Haue men any true ſight, or liuely and ſound feeling of this miſery and wofull eſtate, ſo long as they be meerely naturall?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>No ſurely, but are altogether blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and hardened in it, being nothing deſirous to come out of it, but doe greatly pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in it, and can hardly bée perſwaded that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13922:9"/>
they are in any ſuch wofull caſe; as appeareth plainely in the example of that ruler, who being commanded or rather required of our Sauiour Chriſt to kéep the commandements, anſwered: <hi>All theſe haue I kept from my youth.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,<note place="margin">Luke. 18. 21.</note> although the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> was wretched, miſerable, poore, blind, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; yet ſhe thought her ſelfe rich, encreaſed with goods, and wanting nothing. It followeth then, that ſo long as men are in the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they haue no true ſight and féeling of their miſery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>Do you not thinke that all men being meerely naturall, are vnder the curſe of the Law?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Yea certainly: and not only ſo, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vnder the very tyranny and dominion of Satan, though they know it not, ſee it not, féele it not, or perceiue it not: for all that are not in Chriſt, are vnder the curſe of the law, and the power of darkneſſe and the diuel, as appeareth, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 2.</hi> where the diuell is called the prince that ruleth in the aire, euen the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 4. 2. Tim. 2. 26.</note> place, he is called the god of this world, who blindeth the eies of all vnbeléeuers. And againe, it is ſaid; that all men naturally are in his ſnare being taken captiue of him at his wil.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>Few will be perſwaded of that; they

will ſay, they defie the diuell, and thanke God they were neuer troubled with him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Their hot words do nothing amend the matter: for the diuell is no more driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with words, then with holy water; but he ſitteth in the tongues and mouthes: nay poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the very hearts and intrals of thouſands which ſay they defie him, and are not troubled with him, as appeareth manifeſtly by their particular acttions, and the whole courſe of their life.</p>

               <p>The working of the Diuell in mens ſoules (being an inuiſible ſpirit) is with ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiuable ſleight and crafty conueiance, that men in the eſtate of nature cannot poſſibly féele it, or perceiue it: for how can a blind man ſée, or a dead man féele?</p>

               <p>You muſt know this, that as there is a naturall birth of the whole man; ſo there

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>When as the naturall faculties of the ſoule, as reaſon, vnderſtanding, will and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and the members of the body alſo, are ſo ſanctified, purged and rectified by grace, that we vnderſtand, wil, and deſire that which is good.</p>

               <p>No more then a dead man can deſire the good things of this life.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>You ſpeake, as if a man could do no other thing but ſinne, till the new worke be wrought in him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>That is mine opinion indéed: for a man &amp; his fleſh are all one, til he be regenerate; they agrée together like man &amp; wife, they ioine together in all euill, they liue and die together: for when the fleſh periſheth, the man periſheth.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>Is not this regeneration a changing or rather a deſtroying of humane nature?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing leſſe: It is neither an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing, nor changing of the ſubſtance of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die or ſoule, or any of the faculties thereof: but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13922:12"/>
only a rectifying and repairing of them by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing the corruption.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>Is then our naturall corruption ſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and quite remoued by the power of grace, as that it remaineth not at all in vs, but that we are wholly freed of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Not ſo. For the reliques and rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of our old nature, which the Scripture calleth the old man, doe hang about vs, and dwell in vs, euen vntill our dying day: as it is plainly prooued in the ten laſt verſes of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth to the <hi>Romanes.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>Then you affirme that this new man or new worke of grace and regeneration, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in this life.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Yea. For the new creature, or new worke of grace, can neuer be fullie faſhioned in this life: but is alwayes in faſhioning. And as our faith and knowledge in this life are vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: ſo is our regeneration, and ſanctification.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>You ſaid before that the regeneration or new birth is of the whole man; which ſpeech ſeemeth to imply, that the new worke of grace is entire and perfect.</p>

               <p>You miſtake the matter.

               <p>This ſeemeth very obſcure, I pray you make it more plaine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt note this, that the new worke and the old, fleſh and ſpirit, grace and corruption, are ſo intermingledly ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all the faculties of the ſoule and body, as that the one doth euer fight againſt the other.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>But tell me, I pray you, how you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this intermingling of grace and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the ſoule? Do you mean that grace is placed in one part of the ſoule, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in another, ſo as they be ſundred in place?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>No, that is not my meaning: but this, that they be ioyned and mingled together (as I ſaid) in and thorowout the whole man. For the minde, or vnderſtanding part, is not one part fleſh, and another part ſpirit: but the whole minde is fleſh, and the whole minde is ſpirit, partly one, and partly another. The ſame is to be ſaid of the will and affection.</p>

               <p>Euen as the ayre in the dawning of the day, is not wholly light, or whollie darke, as at midnight, or at noone day; neither is it in one part light, in another part darke: but the whole aire is partly light, and partly darke

thorowout: and as in a veſſell of luke-warme water, the water it ſelfe is not only hot, nor only colde, but heat and colde are mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in euery part of the water: ſo is the fleſh and the ſpirit mingled together in the ſoule of man.

               <p>Yes ſurely; for there is no pride worſe or more dangerous then that. Beware, ſaith one, of ſpiritual pride; as to be proud of our ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wit, knowledge, reading, writings, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, praiers, godlines, policy, valor, ſtrength, riches, honor, birth, beauty, authority. For God hath not giuen ſuch gifts vnto men, to the end they ſhould make ſale-ware of them, and ſet them a ſunſhining, to behold; ſeking only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with their gifts, the vaine praiſe of the multitude, and applauſe of the people: ſo rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing God of his honor, and proudly arrogating to themſelues, that which is due vnto God; which is the praiſe of his gifts. But he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his gifts to an other end: namely, that we ſhould vſe them to his glory, and the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (either in church or common-wealth) eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of thoſe which doe moſt concerne vs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>True indéed: For the fineſt cloth is ſooneſt ſtained. And as wormes ingender ſooner in ſoft and tender wood, than in that which is more hard and knotty: and as moths do bréed ſooner in fine wool, then in courſe flocks: Euen ſo pride, and vaine-glory, doe ſooner aſſault an excellent and rare man in all kinde of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; vertue, then an other of meaner gifts. And therefore pride is ſaid to ſpring out of the aſhes of all vertues. For men will be proud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are wiſe, learned, godly, patient, humble, &amp;c. Pride therefore may very fitly be compared to the crab-ſtock ſpeins, which grow out of the root of the very beſt apple-trée. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay the truth, this is one of the laſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines and weapons, which the diuell vſeth for the ouerthrowing of Gods owne children: euen to blow them vp with pride, as it were with gunpowder. For as we ſée it come to paſſe in the ſiedge of ſtrong holdes, when no battery or force of ſhot will preuaile, the laſt remedy and policy is to vndermine it, and blow it vp with traines of gun-powder: ſo when Sathan can no way preuaile, againſt ſome excellent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God, his laſt deuice is, to blow them vp with pride, as it were with gunpowder.</p>

               <p>I ſee it is a ſpeciall grace of God,

for men of great gifts, to be humble minded; &amp; he is an old man of a thouſand, which excelling in gifts, doth excel in humility; &amp; the more gifts he hath, the more humbly he walketh: not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning others; but eſteeming them better then himſelfe. For commonly we are the woorſe for Gods gifts; becauſe we haue not the right vſe of them; and againe, becauſe they ingender ſo much proud fleſh in vs, that we had need daily to be corzied. Therefore God ſheweth great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour &amp; mercy to that man, whom he humbleth and taketh downe by any afflictions, or infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whatſoeuer.

And euen ſo doth he cure many of vs, of our pride, by throwing vs to ſathan, leauing vs to our ſelues, and giuing vs ouer, to commit ſome groſſe euill, euen to fal downe and breake our neckes; and all, to the end he may humble vs, tame vs, and pull down our pride, which he ſéeth we are heart-ſicke of. It is good for vs
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13922:24"/>
therefore to be humble in the abundance of graces, that we be not proud of that which we haue, or that which we haue done. <hi>For</hi> humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſinne, is better then pride in well doing.</p>

               <p>No ſurely, none at all. For the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>Who ſeparateth thee? And what haſt<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.</note> thou, that thou haſt not receiued? If thou haſt receiued it, why boaſteſt thou, as though thou haddeſt not receiued it?</hi> Where the Apoſtle plainely ſheweth, that no man is to be proud
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13922:24"/>
of his gifts; becauſe they are none of his own: he hath but receiued them to vſe. We count him worthy to be laughed at as a foole, who hauing borrowed braue apparell of others (as a ſilke gown, a ſatten doublet, a chaine of gold, veluet bréeches, &amp;c.) ſhould proudly iet in the ſtréets in them, as if they were his owne: Euen ſo they are worthy to be Chronicled for fooles, which are proud of good gifts, which are none of their own. Therefore the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaith: <hi>Thus ſayth the Lord; Let not the wiſe<note place="margin">Ier. 9. 23.</note> man glory in his wiſedome, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength, neither the rich man in his rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: but let him that glorieth glorie in this, that he vnderſtandeth and knoweth me.</hi> To this point alſo wel ſaith the Heathen Poet: <hi>No man<note place="margin">Theocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> can eſcape the puniſhment of pride; therefore in greateſt proſperitie be not puſſed vp.</hi>

They contemne and diſdame all others which haue not the like gifts.

               <p>I thinke it to be a vanitie of all vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and a folly of all follies. For to be proud of apparrell, is, as if a théefe ſhould be proud of his halter, a begger of his clouts, a child of his gay, or a foole of his bable.</p>

               <p>I ſay, they are farre from that plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſimplicitie, and modeſty, which hath béen in former ages, our fore-fathers knew no ſuch things. It is recorded of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time<note place="margin">Graftons Chron.</note> King of this Land, that when his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine on a time brought him a new paire of hoſe, he demaunded of him what they coſt: who
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13922:26"/>
anſwered, thrée ſhillings. Whereat the King being ſomewhat mooued, commaunded him to prepare him a paire of a marke. If Kings were then thought to excéed, that beſtowed a Marke vpon a paire of hoſe, what is it to be thought of many meane men in theſe our daies, (yea ſuch as haue no liuing, and are ſearſe of any good cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) which beſtow as much vpon one paire, as the King did vpon two, when he was thought moſt of all to excéed? But alas, alas, we haue paſſed all bounds of modeſty and meaſure: there is no hoe with vs. Our land is too heauy of this ſinne. For the pride of all Nations, and the follies of all Countries are vpon vs; how ſhall we beare them? And as for theſe new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, the more new they be, the more fooliſh and ridiculous are they. For with our new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, we are growen cleane out of faſhion. If we had as many faſhions of our bodies, as we haue of our attire, we ſhould haue as many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions as fingers and toes.

               <p>I know right well, that apparell in it owne nature is a thing indifferent: but lewd, wanton, immodeſt, and offenſiue apparell is not indifferent. For all ſuch abuſe taketh away the indifferency of them, and maketh them ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and euill, by circumſtance. For otherwiſe, why ſhould the Lord threaten by his Prophet,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13922:28"/>
that he would viſit the Princes, and the Kings children and all ſuch as were clothed with ſtrange apparell, that is, the faſhions of other countries: <hi>Zeph. chap. 1. 8.</hi> Againe; why ſhould the Lord ſo plague the proud dames, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing minions of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> for their pride and vanity in attire, if there were no euill in ſuch kinde of abuſe? the Lord ſaith thus, in the third of <hi>Eſay,</hi> againſt thoſe braue &amp; gallant dames; <hi>Becauſe the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walke with ſtretched-out neckes and with wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring eies, walking and minſing as they go, and make a tinkling with their feet: therefore ſhall the Lord make the heads of the daughters of Zion bald, and the Lord ſhall diſcouer their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret parts. In that day ſhall the Lord take away the ornament of the ſlippers, and the calles, and the round tires, the ſweet bals, and the bracelets, and the bonnets, the tiers of the head, and the ſtops, the head-bands, and the tablets, the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, the rings, and the mufflers, the coſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and the vailes, and the wimples, and the criſping pinnes, and the glaſſes, and the fine linnen, and the hoods, and the lawnes. And in ſtead of ſweete ſauour, there ſhall be ſtinke; and in ſtead of a girdle, a rent: and in ſtead of dreſſing of the haire, baldneſſe: and in ſtead of a Stomacher, a girding of Sacke-cloth, and burning in ſteade of beautie. Then</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:13922:28"/>
                  <hi>ſhall her gates mourne and lament: and ſhee being deſolate, ſhall ſit vpon the ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſée how terrible the Lord threatneth the gallant dames of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for their exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue and abhominable pride. And this may wel be a Mirrour for the proud minions of our age, which aſſuredly may well feare, the Lord will bring ſome ſuch iudgement vpon them, as hée did vpon the daughters of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> For their ſin is as great in this kinde, as was the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Zion:</hi> and God is the ſame God now that he was then, to puniſh it.</p>

               <p>I may well ſet downe what I will: but ſurely moſt men and women will do what they liſt. For verily it may be thought that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this age haue forſworn God, &amp; his word, &amp; al goodneſſe. For they are come to this point, let God ſay what he will, they will do what they liſt. For as the Prophet ſaith; <hi>They haue made a couenant with Hell, and with death, and are growen to an agreement: <hi>Eſay</hi>
                  </hi> 28. 15. And I doe verily thinke, if God himſelfe ſhould come downe from Heauen in his owne perſon, and diſſwade men and women from this vanitie of apparell, yet would they ſtill vſe it, as it were in deſpite of God, and as it were to anger him
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13922:29"/>
the more. For they are ſo extraordinarily ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured, and ſo immoderately delighted with it, and do ſo continually, and altogether dote on it, and are ſo wood mad of it, that they will haue it, though men and angels, and all the world ſay nay: nay, which is more, though they ſhould go to the diuel quicke with it. And therfore it is but loſt labour to ſpeake againſt it, preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, or write againſt it. It is but euen to plough the ſea, or knocke at a deafe mans doore: for there is no hope of any reformation. Onely this we gaine, that the world is reprooued and conuicted of ſinne: and theſe things ſhall ſtand in record againſt them, in the laſt day: ſo that they may ſay, they had a faire warning, and that there was a Prophet amongſt them.</p>

               <p>Well then, for their ſakes which are well diſpoſed, I will ſet downe ſome few dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>1.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13922:30"/>
women that profeſſe the feare of God: and not with broydered haire, or gold, or pearles or coſtly apparell. The Apoſtle <hi>Saint Peter</hi> giueth like rules alſo: for he ſaith, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 3.</note> of Chriſtian matrones, and profeſſors of holy Religion, that their apparell muſt not be outward, that is, not conſiſt ſo much in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward brauery (as <hi>broydered haire, gold put about, &amp;c.) as it muſt be inward; that the hid man of the hart may be clothed with a meeke &amp; quiet ſpirit: which is a thing before God much ſet by. For after this manner,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in times paſt, the holy women, which truſted in God, did attire themſelues: as Sara, Rebecca, Rachel;</hi> and ſuch like ancient and graue matrones.</p>

The wiſe king ſaith: <hi>He that committeth Adulterie with<note place="margin">Pro. 6. 32.</note> women, deſtroieth his owne ſoule:</hi> and ſo is acceſſarie to his owne death, which is no ſmall matter. For wée vſe to ſay, if a man hang himſelfe, drowne himſelfe, or any manner of way make away himſelfe: that he was curſed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13922:35"/>
of God, that Gods hand was heauie againſt him, that the diuell ought him a ſhame, and now he hath paid it him. And all the countrey rings of ſuch a ſtrange accident, when, and where it falleth out: and the Crowner of the Countrey doth ſit vpon it. How much more may all the world wonder at this, that a man ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his owne ſoule, and wittingly and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt away himſelfe for euer! Now the holy Ghoſt ſaith: the Adulterer doth ſuch an act, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſuch a venture, and willingly murthereth himſelfe. Oh, therefore woe vnto him, that euer he was borne. For ſure it is that great Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of heauen, that crownes whom hée will crowne, ſhal one day ſit vpon it, and giue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Moreouer, as the Adulterer ſinneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſoule: ſo alſo he ſinneth againſt his bodie after a ſpeciall manner, as witneſſeth the<note place="margin">1.

Alſo he ſinneth againſt his goods and outward eſtate: as the holy man <hi>Iob</hi> teſtifieth, ſaying: <hi>Adulterie is a fire, that deuoureth to<note place="margin">Iob 31. 12.</note> deſtruction, and it will roote out all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</hi> Furthermore he ſinneth againſt his name. <hi>For the Adulterer ſhall finde a wound<note place="margin">Pro. 6. 33.</note> and diſhonour: and his reproch ſhall neuer be put away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item, he ſinneth againſt his wife: who is his companion and the wife of his couenant.</hi> And God ſaith, in the ſame place: <hi>Let none</hi>

                  <hi>treſpaſſe againſt the wife of his youth: keepe your ſelues in your ſpirit, and tranſgreſſe not.</hi> Laſt of all he ſinneth againſt his children and poſteritie: as the Lord ſaid to <hi>Dauid: Becauſe<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 10.</note> thou haſt deſpiſed me, and done this, therefore the ſword ſhall neuer depart from thy houſe. Beholde I will raiſe vp euill againſt thee, out of thine owne houſe.</hi> Now therefore, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point, we may ſée how many deadly wounds men make in themſelues, by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of adultery. They wound themſelues in their ſoules. They wound themſelues in their bodies. They wound themſelues in their goods. They wound themſelues in their names. They wound themſelues in their wiues, and in their children. What man, except he were ſtark mad, would thruſt in himſelfe, in ſo many places, at once? The adulterer, with his owne ſin of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, maketh all theſe deadly wounds in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And it is a hundred to one he will neuer get them cured, but will die, and bléed to death of them. Lo, thus you ſée the dangerous quality and condition of this ſin. Shall we now therfore make light of it? Shall we ſay it is but a tricke of youth? Shal we ſmooth ouer the matter with ſwéet words, when the holy Ghoſt maketh it ſo hainous and capitall? Shal we make nothing of that, which draweth downe Gods wrath vpon the ſoule, body, goods, name, wife and children?

That were an intolerable blindneſſe, and moſt extreame hardneſſe of heart. An ancient writer hath long agoe paſſed ſentence vpon vs, who make ſo light of this ſin: for, (ſaith he) <hi>Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Baſil in Epiſt. Gregor.</note> is the very hooke of the diuell; whereby he draweth vs to deſtruction.</hi> And another godly Father ſaith: that <hi>Adulterie is like a furnace, whoſe mouth is gluttonie, the flame pride, the ſparkles filthy words, the ſmoke an euill name, the aſhes pouertie, and the end ſhame.</hi> And ſo wée plainly ſée, that howſoeuer wée regard not this ſinne, but flatter our ſelues in it, yet thoſe, whoſe eies the Lord hath opened, haue in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges condemned it as moſt flagitious and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: yea the very Heathen will riſe vp in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt vs; who haue ſpoken and written many things againſt this filthy &amp; beaſtly vice.</p>

               <p>Now indeede you haue ſufficiently branded the vice of adulterie; and laid out the vglineſſe thereof, that all men may behold it ſtarke naked and abhorre it. If any man (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this) will venture vpon it, hee may be ſaide to be a moſt deſperate monſter. For what doth he elſe, but (as it were) put his finger into the Lions mouth, and (as it were) take the beare by the tooth? and they may well know what will follow, and what they may looke for. Let all men therefore in time take heed to themſelues, and to their owne ſoules,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13922:36"/>
as they will anſwer it at their vttermoſt perill, at the dreadfull day of iudgement, when the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of all hearts ſhalbe diſcloſed. But now one thing reſteth; to wit, that you ſhould ſhew vs the ſpeciall roots and cauſes of adulterie.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>There be fiue ſpeciall cauſes of it. The firſt is our naturall corruption: for the verie ſpawne and ſéed of all ſinne is in our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature: and this, of all other, is a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent ſinne, as witneſſeth the Apoſtle <hi>Iames,</hi> ſaying: <hi>When luſt hath conceiued, it bringeth<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 15.</note> foorth ſinne; and ſinne, when it is perfected, bringeth forth death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is gluttonie and fulneſſe of Bread: for when men haue filled their bellies, and crammed their paunches, as full of good cheare, wine, and ſtrong drinke, as their ſkins can hold, what are they méet for, or what mind they elſe, but adulterie and vncleanneſſe? And therfore well ſaith one: <hi>Great nouriſhment, and groſſe feed, it is the ſhop of luſt.</hi> The Heathen<note place="margin">Eſt offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina Terence.</note> Poet could ſkill to ſay, <hi>Sine, Cicere &amp; Baccho friget Venus. <hi>Without meat and drinke, luſt waxeth colde.</hi>
                  </hi> And to this effect the wiſe king ſaith, that <hi>their eies ſhall behold ſtrange wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">Pro. 23. verſ. 3. &amp; verſ. 33.</note> whoſe hearts are ſet vpon wine and belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheare.</hi> And therefore he aduiſeth all men, not to looke vpon the wine when it appeareth red, when it ſheweth his colour in the cup, or
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13922:37"/>
ſtirreth very kindely: and that for feare of this after-clap. An ancient writer ſaith to the ſam purpoſe: <hi>Hee that delicately pampereth his<note place="margin">Gregori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anz.</note> belly, and yet would ouercome the ſpirit of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, is like him that will quench a flame of fire with Oyle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, to cloſe vp this point, ſure it is, though men pray, heare, and read much, and be otherwiſe well diſpoſed: yet except they be abſteinous in diet, they will be much troubled with luſt.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe of adulterie, is Idleneſſe: For when men are lazie, luſkiſh, and idle, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing to do, they lie wide open to adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie; and luſt créepeth into them. Some Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographers write, the Crab-fiſh is very deſirous to eat Oyſters: but becauſe ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perforee open them, ſhe watcheth her time when they open themſelues vnto the ſun after the tide, and then ſhe putteth in her claw, and pulleth out the Oyſter. Euen ſo ſathan watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his opportunity againſt vs, that he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and breath into vs all filthy luſts, and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous deſires, when wée lie open vnto him by idleneſſe. Wiſely therfore to this point ſaid the Gréeke Poet: <hi>Much reſt nouriſheth luſt.</hi> And<note place="margin">Heſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> another Poet ſaith: <hi>Quaritur agiſtus quare ſit factus adulter? In promtu cauſa eſt: deſidioſus erat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Slothfull lazineſſe is the cauſe of Adulterie,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13922:37"/>
And therefore another ſaith: <hi>Eſchew idleneſſe,<note place="margin">Otia ſi tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, periere cupidinis ar cus.</note> and cut the ſinewes of luſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth cauſe of adultery, is wanton ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell: which is a miniſtrelſie, that pipes vp a daunce vnto whoredome. But of this enough before.</p>
               <p>The fift and laſt part of adultery, is the hope of impunitie, or eſcaping of puniſhment. For many being blinded and hardened by Sathan, thinke they ſhall neuer be called to an account for it: And becauſe they can bleare the eies of men, and carry this ſin ſo cloſely vnder a cloud, that it ſhall neuer come to light, they thinke all is ſafe, and that God ſéeth them not. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith: <hi>The eie of the adulterer waiteth<note place="margin">Iob 24. 15.</note> for the twi-light, and ſaith; None eie ſhall ſee me.</hi> And in another place; <hi>How ſhall God<note place="margin">Iob 23. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> know? can he iudge thorow the darke cloud?</hi> But verily, verily, though the adulterer doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo cloſely and cunningly conuey his ſin vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a canopie, yet the time will come when it ſhall be diſcloſed, to his eternall ſhame. <hi>For<note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 24.</note> God will bring euery worke to iudgement, with euery ſecret thought; whether it be good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</hi> For <hi>he hath ſet our moſt ſecret ſins in the<note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 8.</note> light of his countenance.</hi> And <hi>hee will lighten<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 5.</note> the things that are hid in darkneſſe, and make the counſels of the heart manifeſt.</hi> For this cauſe <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith; <hi>When I ſinne, thou watcheſt</hi>

               <speaker>Theo.</speaker>
               <p>The firſt is an eager and ſharp ſet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of getting. Therefore the holy Ghoſt ſaith:<note place="margin">Pro. 28. Pro. 20. 21.</note>

               <p>The ſecond is a pinching and niggardly kéeping of our owne, that is, when men (being able to giue) will hardly part with any thing, though it be to neuer ſo holy and good vſe.

               <p>The third is, the neglect of holy duties: that is, when mens minds are ſo taken vp with the loue of earthly things, that they begin to ſlacke and coole in matters of Gods worſhip.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt is, a truſting in riches, and ſtaying vpon them, as though our liues were maintained by them, or did conſiſt onely in them: which thing our Lord Jeſus flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth, ſaying: <hi>Though a man haue abundance,</hi>

               <p>The other is the want of taſting and féeling of heauenly things: For till men taſte better things, they will make much of theſe: till they feele heauen, they will loue earth: til they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, they will be couetous.</p>

               <p>Then will I briefly diſpatch things in order.

Moreouer, it ſpreadeth far &amp; néere, it dwelleth in euery houſe, in euery towne, in euery city; it prieth into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery corner, it creepeth into euery heart; it anoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our Phyſitians, it infecteth our Diuines, it choaketh our Lawyers, it woundeth our Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, it baneth our Gentlemen, it murthereth our tradeſ-men, it be witcheth our Merchants, it ſtingeth our mariners. Oh couetouſnes, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes, it is the poiſon of al things, the wound of Chriſtianitie, the bane of all goodneſſe! For couetouſneſſe marres all: it marreth all, euery where, in all places, in all degrées, amongſt all
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:13922:41"/>
perſons. It marreth marriages: for it coupleth young to old, and old to young.

And therefore what ſinne ſo grieuous, what euill ſo odious, what vice ſo enormous as this? For this cauſe it was pretily ſaid of one: that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices are but Factors to Couetouſnes, and ſerue for Porters to fetch and bring in her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.

O what a diuell incarnate is this, that ſetteth ſo many vices a worke, and hath ſo many Factors and vnderlings to ſerue her turne! Are they not in a prety caſe, thinke you, that are infected with this ſin? Oh, they are in a moſt miſerable caſe. It had béene good they had neuer béene borne. For being aliue they are dead: dead I meane in their ſoules. For Couetouſnes is ſoules poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſoules bane. Couetouſnes is the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt poiſon to the ſoule that is. It is a confection of all the Spiders. Toades, Snakes, Adders, Scorpions, Baſiliſkes, and all other the moſt venemous vermine of the whole world? If the diuell can get vs to take downe but one penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weight of it, it is enough, he deſires no more.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:13922:41"/>
For preſently we fal down ſtark dead. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>They that will be rich</hi> (he meaneth in all haſte, by hooke or by crooke) <hi>fall into temptations, and ſnares, and into many<note place="margin">1.

And therefore he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the ſame place: <hi>But thou O man of God flie theſe things.</hi> In which words he doth moſt grauely aduiſe all the Miniſters of the word of God, to take héed of it.

               <p>Indeede it muſt needs be graunted, that Couetouſneſſe is a very grieuous ſinne: yea euen a monſter with ſeuen heads. Yet for all that, wee ſee in this our iron age, how many of all ſorts are infected with it: and how few will giue any thing to any holy vſe. Moſt men now adayes haue nothing to ſpare for Chriſt, nothing for his Goſpell, nothing for his Church, nothing for the poore children of God, and needy members of Chriſt. Chriſt is a little beholden vnto them: for they will do nothing for him, no not ſo much as ſpeake a good word in his cauſe, or the cauſe of his poore Saints. Euery little thing with them,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13922:42"/>
is too much for God, and good men. For when they come to giuing vnto holy and neceſſary vſes, then they will ſticke at a penny, and ſcotch at a great, and euery thing is too much. But to beſtow vpon themſelues, nothing is too much. Nothing is too much for luſt, for pleaſure, for backe, bellie, and building; for cards and dice, for whores and harlots, for rioting and reuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for Tauernes and brothel-houſes. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and thouſands are little enough, and too little, for their expences this way. It is lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conſider, what maſſes of mony are ſpent and beſtowed vpon theſe things. But, alas, alas, how heauie an account are they to make in the day of the Lord, which ſo ſpend their lands, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, and reuenues!

               <p>Many ſuch men as you are, can ſkill to giue good words, and ſay: Fie on this world: al is but vanity: and yet for all that in your dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſe, you are neuertheleſſe ſet vpon the world, nor neuer the more ſeeke after God. You heare the word of God no whit the more, you read no whit the more, you pray neuer the more; which euidently ſheweth, that all your faire ſpeeches, and proteſtations, are nought elſe but hypocriſie and leazing. Your heart is not with God, for all this. All is but words, there is no ſuch feeling in the heart.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13922:43"/>
And therefore I may iuſtly ſay to you, as God himſelfe ſaid to his people: This people haue<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 28.</note> ſaid well, all that they haue ſaid. Oh, that there were an heart in them to feare me, and keep my commandements!</p>

For all things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there is no cauſe why men ſhould be ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to this world: <hi>For</hi> they muſt leaue it, when they haue done all that they can.

                  </hi> 39. 6. I wonder therefore that theſe Moules and Muck-wormes of this earth, ſhould ſo minde theſe ſhadowiſh things, and ſo dote on them as they doe. If they were not altogether hardned and blinded by the diuell, they would not be ſo néerely knit

               <p>The wiſe king, who had the greateſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of theſe things, that euer man had (for hée enioyed whatſoeuer this world could affoord, vpward and downeward, backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) yet could find nothing in them, but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vexation of ſpirit.

The wordes of the holy Ghoſt are theſe: <hi>Wilt thou cauſe thine eyes to<note place="margin">Pro. 23. 5.</note> flie after them?</hi> (meaning riches) <hi>Thou mayſt: but they will not be found.

               <p>Therefore all worldly men doe but weaue the Spiders webbe, and may fitly be compared to the ſilly Spider, who toileth her ſelfe, and laboureth all the weeke long to finiſh vp her webbe; that ſhe may lodge her ſelfe in it, as in her owne houſe and frée<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hold.

For what is become of the greateſt Monarchs, Kings, Princes, Potentates, and Magnificoes, that euer the world had?

they were as terrible as Lions: fearefull to all men: full of pompe and glorie, dignitie and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie. They plowed vp all things, they bare all before them, and who but they?

ſaid of the Dragons taile. <hi>Apoc:</hi> 12. which is, ambition, conetouſnes, &amp; the loue of this world.

But one thing commeth often into my minde; to wit, that theſe miſerable worldlings can haue no ſound comfort in their pleaſures and profits: becauſe they haue no comfort in God, nor peace in their owne conſciences.</p>

               <p>You ſay very true. It is vnpoſſible, that men, louing this world, ſhould haue anie ſound comfort in God. For no man can ſerue two maſters, both God and riches. Their caſe therefore is very dangerous &amp; fearefull, though they neuer ſée it, nor féele it: as I will ſhew you by a plaine example. Put caſe, one of theſe great rich worldlings ſhould be clothed in vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet &amp; cloth of gold, in moſt ſtately manner; and alſo ſhould be ſet at his table, furniſhed with al the dainties of the world; ſhould be attended and waited vpon by many, in moſt Lordly and pompous manner; ſhould ſit in his goodly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-chamber, all glittering like golde; ſhould haue his firſt, ſecond, &amp; third ſeruice ſerued in, with minſtrels and inſtruments of muſicke, in moſt royall ſort; he ſitteth in his chaire, like a King in his throne: yet for all this, if a dagger ſhould be held to his heart all this while, ready to ſtab him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what pleaſure, what ioy, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can he haue in all the reſt? Euen ſo, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer pompe or pleaſures wicked worldlings haue héere below, yet their guilty &amp; helliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is, as it were, a dagger, held alwayes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13922:49"/>
hard to their hart; ſo as they can haue no ſound co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort in any thing. Or let me giue it you thus: Put caſe a man hath committed high treaſon, and were therfore apprehended, arraigned, and condemned to be hanged, drawen and quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: what then can comfort him in ſuch a caſe? can mirth, can muſicke, can gold, can ſiluer, can lands, can liuings? No, no: none of all theſe can help him, or giue him any comfort. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall thoughts of death do ſo gripe him at the heart, that none of all theſe can do him any good or any whit mitigate his griefe. What then is the thing that may comfort him in this caſe? Only a pardon, ſealed with the Kings broad ſeale, and ſubſcribed with his owne hand. For as ſoone as he hath got this, his heauy heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiueth, and leapes for ioy. This then aſſuredly is the very cauſe of all prophane Atheiſts and worldlings, who are not aſiured of the King of heauen his pardon for their ſinne: and then, what ioy can they haue either in their meat, drinke, goods, cattell, wiues, children, lands, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewes, or any thing whatſoeuer? For the dreadful thoughts of hel do eftſoones croſſe them inwardly, &amp; quite dampe &amp; daſh all their mirth. Their owne conſciences will not be ſtilled: but in moſt terrible manner, riſe vp &amp; giue euidence againſt them, telling them flatly, they ſhall be damned, how merry and iocund ſoeuer they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13922:50"/>
ſéeme to be in this world; ſetting a good face on the matter. For ſure it is, that inwardly they haue many a cold pull, and many heart gripes. And all their mirth and iollity, is but a gigling from the téeth outward: they can haue no ſound comfort within. And therefore the wiſe King<note place="margin">Pro. 14 13.</note> ſaith; <hi>Euen in laughter the heart is ſorrowfull: and the end of that mirth is heauineſſe.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſaith the holy man <hi>Iob; Terrors of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence come vpon the wicked man like waters: in<note place="margin">Iob. 27. 20.</note> the night a whirle-winde carrieth him away ſecretly.

               <p>You haue ſpoken many things very ſharpely againſt couetouſneſſe: but in my mind, ſo long as a man couets nothing but his owne, he cannot be ſaid to be couetous.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, that he may. For not only is he couetous, which gréedily deſireth other mens goods; but euen he alſo which ouer niggardly and pinchingly holdeth faſt his owne, &amp; is ſuch
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13922:50"/>
a miſer, that he will part with nothing. We ſée the world is full of ſuch pinch-pennies, that wil let nothing goe; except it be wrung from them perforce, as a key out of <hi>Hercules</hi> hand.</p>
               <p>Theſe gripple muck-rakers had as léeue part with their blood, as their goods. They wil pinch their owne backs &amp; bellies, to get their god into their cheſts. And when they haue once got him in there, will they eaſily part with him trow yée? No, no: a man will not part with his god, for no mans pleaſure. He will eat peaſebread, and drinke ſmall drinke, rather then he will diminiſh his god. Therefore the ſcripture ſaith: <hi>Eate not the meat of him that hath an euill eye:<note place="margin">Pro. 13. 6.</note> and deſire not his dainty diſhes. For as hee grudgeth his owne ſoule; ſo he will ſay vnto thee: Eat and drinke, when his heart is not with thee. Thou ſhalt vomit thy morſels, which thou haſt eaten, and loſe thy pleaſant ſpeeches.</hi> The old ſaying is, The coueteus man wanteth as well that which he hath, as that which hée hath not: becauſe he hath no vſe of that which he hath.

               <p>Yet, for all this, men muſt follow their worldly buſineſſe, and lay to liue. For it is an hard world, and goods are not eaſie to come by. Therefore men muſt plie their buſineſſe,

               <p>It is one thing to vſe theſe things: and another thing to loue them &amp; ſet our hearts vpon them. For the Scripture ſaith: <hi>If riches increaſe, ſet not your heart vpon them: <hi>Pſa.</hi>
                  </hi> 62. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> alſo ſaith: <hi>Loue not this world, nor the<note place="margin">1.

Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith: that <hi>they which vſe this world,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> ſhould be as though they vſed it not.</hi> Where he alloweth a ſober and moderate vſe of the things of this life, in the feare of God. We muſt vſe this world for neceſſities ſake, as we vſe meat and drinke. For, no more of this world then néedes muſt: for feare of ſurfetting. The holy Ghoſt ſaith: <hi>Let your conuerſation be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out couetouſnes, &amp; be content with things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 5.</note> Happy is that man therefore, that is well content with his preſent eſtate whatſoeuer,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13922:51"/>
and carrieth himſelfe moderately and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably therein. For the ſpirit ſaith: <hi>There is no profit to a man vnder the Sunne: but that hee eat and drinke, and delight his ſoule with<note place="margin">Ec. 2. 24.</note> the profit of his labours. I ſaw alſo this, that this is of the hand of God.</hi> In which words, the prudent King ſaith thus much, in effect: that this is all the good we can attaine vnto in this world, euen to take a ſober and comfortable vſe of the things of this life, which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth vpon vs. And further hée auoucheth, <hi>That thus to vſe them aright, and with ſound comfort, is a very rare gift of God.</hi> For as one ſaith: <hi>He is a wiſe man, that is not greeued for<note place="margin">Gregori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Nazi.</note> the things which he hath not: but doth reioyce in the things that he hath: vſing them to Gods glorie, and his owne comfort.</hi> So then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point, and returne you an anſwer thus: That we may in ſober and godly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, vſe gold, ſiluer, and the things of this life: but at no hand to ouer-loue them, or giue our hearts vnto them.</p>

               <p>Well: yet for all this, I cannot ſee, but that theſe preachers and profeſſors, theſe learned men, and preciſe fellowes, are euen as eager of the world, &amp; as couetous as any other.</p>

               <p>Now you ſhew your venemous ſpirit, againſt better men then your ſelfe. And I haue a foure-fold anſwer for you. Firſt I anſwer,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13922:52"/>
that although godly men may be ſomewhat o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken this way, and ouer-ſpirt a little, yet they breake not out ſo groſiv as others. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if God leaue them ſometimes to be ouercome of the world: yet he, in his great wiſedome and mercy, turneth it to their good. For thereby he firſt humbleth them, &amp; afterward raiſeth them<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> vp againe. And ſo all things worke together for good, to them that loue God. Thirdly, I anſwer, that we liue by rules, &amp; not by examples. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the beſt of Gods people haue had their wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and weakneſſe. Therefore we may not frame rules to liue by, out of the infirmities of the moſt excellent ſeruants of God. Wicked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore &amp; impious is their allegation, which alleage <hi>Dauids</hi> adultery, <hi>Lots</hi> drunkennes, <hi>Peters</hi> fall, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſlips, <hi>Salomons</hi> weakeneſſe, &amp;c. for a ſhelter &amp; defence of themſeines in the like ſins. Laſtly, I anſwere, that you do greatly wound your ſelfe, in your own ſpéech: ſo far off are you from mending your market any whit thereby. For if Preachers and other godly men (after many prayers and téeres, &amp; much meanes vſed) cannot eſcape ſcot-frée, but ſomtimes are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and almoſt ouerthrowen, by the world and the Diuel; what then ſhall become of you, which vſe no meanes at all, nor any gaine ſtriuing, but willingly giue place to the Diuell? If the Diuell did ouer-maſter <hi>Dauid, Lot, Sampſon,</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:13922:52"/>
                  <hi>Salomon,</hi> and other ſuch excellent Worthies: alas, what ſhall become of méere worldlings and Atheiſts? If the moſt valiant men, and thiefe Captaines in a battell goe downe, what ſhall become of the faint-hearted ſouldiers? and as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith; <hi>If the righteous ſcarſe<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 18.</note> be ſaued, where ſhall the wicked and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare?</hi> So then I take you at the rebound, and returne your owne weapon vpon your ſelfe, that ſith godly men cannot eſcape thorow this world, without blowes, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them which know not what godlineſſe meaneth?</p>

               <p>Yet, I ſay once againe, that men muſt liue, men muſt lay for this world: wee cannot liue by the Scriptures. And as for that which you call couetouſneſſe, it is but good husbandrie.</p>

               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>I thought, wée ſhould haue it at laſt. Now you haue paid it home: you are come to the old bias, and as an Hare to her old forme, and her old couert. For this is the very couert and thicket of the world, wherein they would hide couetouſneſſe: but I will do what I can to hunt you out of it, by the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith: <hi>He that ſpareth more<note place="margin">Pro. 11. 24.</note> then is right, ſhall ſurely come to pouertie.</hi> So then you ſée, that couetouſnes bringeth pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thus therefore I reaſon: that which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:13922:53"/>
pouerty is no good huſbandry: but couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and too much ſparing, bringeth pouertie: therefore it is no good huſbandry. The ſame <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaith; <hi>He that is giuen to gaine, troubleth his owne houſe.</hi> That is, the couetous man is an occaſion of many euils, in his eſtate and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. From this Scripture I do thus reaſon; That which troubleth a mans houſe, is no good huſbandrie: but couetouſneſſe troubleth a mans houſe: therefore it is no good huſbandrie. Laſt of all, the old prouerbe ſaith: <hi>Couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe bringeth nothing home.</hi> And therfore it is no good huſbandrie. For oftentimes we do ſée, that men, for couetouſneſſe of more, loſe that which otherwiſe they might haue had. One of the wiſe Heathen ſaith: <hi>Euill gaine is as bad as<note place="margin">Heſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> loſſe.</hi> But the couetous man doth ſéeke after wicked gaine, and therefore ſéeketh loſſe: and conſequently, is no good huſband. Another ſaith: <hi>Vniuſt gaine, bringeth both loſſe and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phocilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> And therefore it is far enough off from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and all good huſbandry. Thus then, I hope, you are ſo hunted both by God and men, that this couert cannot hide you. And therefore you muſt out of it, and ſéeke ſome other ſhelter: for this will not ſerue your turne.</p>

               <p>An earneſt thinking vpon the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, is a preſent remedy againſt the moſt fooliſh &amp; pining carefulneſſe of men for this life. For if we would ſeriouſly weigh &amp; déeply conſider the prouident care that God hath had for his children in all ages, touching food &amp; rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and how ſtrangely he hath prouided for them, it might ſuffice to correct this euil in vs,

and miniſter vnto vs a notable preſeruatiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt couetouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>We read how wonderfully the Lord did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for his Prophet <hi>Eliah,</hi> in the time of the great dearth &amp; drought, that was in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Did not the Lord command the rauens to féed him, by the riuer <hi>Cherith?</hi> did not the rauens bring<note place="margin">1.

                  <note place="margin">Phil 4. 5.</note> Are not theſe large promiſes ſufficient to ſtay vp our faith in Gods prouidence? ſhal we think God ieſteth with vs? ſhall we thinke he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no ſuch matter? ſhall we imagine he will not kéepe touch? Oh, it were blaſphemy once to thinke it: For God is true, and all men lyers. He is faithfull that hath promiſed. His word is more then the faith of a Prince: more then ten thouſand Obligations: Why then doe we not reſt vpon it? why goe we any further? why doe we not take his word? why doe we not depend wholly vpon him? why are we ſtill couetous? why are we ſtil diſtruſtful? why doe we diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; deceiue? Oh we of little faith! Our Lord Jeſus (knowing right well the diſtruſtfulneſſe

of our nature, and the déepe root it hath in vs) is not only content to make theſe great and royall promiſes vnto vs which were inough; but alſo ſtrengthneth and backeth vs with many ſtrong reaſons, to ſupport our weakeneſſe in this behalfe.

day, both break-faſt, dinner, and ſupper: it might ſerue to correct our diſtruſtfulneſſe. For who euer ſaw theſe, or any other ſoule ſtarue, for hunger? ſo good a father, and ſo good a nurſe haue they. And are not we much better then they? hath not God more care of vs, then of them? yes verily, a thouſand times. For he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them, but for our ſakes: how much more then doth he loue our ſelues? Therfore I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain &amp; again: if we would conſider theſe things, &amp; lay them to heart, they wold nip couetouſnes on the head, &amp; driue it quite out of our hearts. Let vs conſider therefore, that God prouided for man before man was: then how much more will he prouide for man, now that he is? Is he our Father, &amp; wil he not prouide for vs? Is he our king, and wil he not regard vs? Is he our ſhepheard, and wil he not looke to vs? Hath he prouided heauen for vs, and wil he not giue vs earth? Hath he giuen vs his ſonne Chriſt, and ſhal he not with him giue vs all things? Doth he prouide for his enemies, and wil he not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for his friends? doth he prouide for whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers; &amp; wil he neglect his choſen? Doth he ſend his raine, &amp; cauſe his Sunne to ſhine vpon the vniuſt, and ſhall he not vpon the iuſt? Doth he prouide for them which are not of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; will he not prouide for his owne family? Will a man féed his Hogges, and not care for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13922:56"/>
his ſeruants? Or will he care for his ſeruants, and not regard his owne children? Oh then let vs conſider theſe reaſons: let vs remember, that our heauenly Father hath as great care for the preſeruation of his creatures, as once hée had for their creation. Let vs therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that our life conſiſteth not in theſe things; but in the prouidence of God. Let vs remember, that he which giueth the day, will prouide for the things of the day. Let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that God alwaies giueth for ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though not for ſatietie.

               <p>What then is the cauſe that many do want outward things?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>The cauſe is in themſelues, becauſe<note place="margin">Ierom. ad. Heliodorum. Cyprian. in Oratione dominica.</note> they want faith. <hi>For</hi> if wée had faith, wée could want nothing. <hi>For faith feareth no famine,</hi> as ſaith an ancient Father. And another ſaith: <hi>For as much as al things are Gods, he that hath god can want nothing: if he himſelfe be not wanting vnto God.</hi> Therefore to haue God is to haue al things. For if we haue him our friend we haue enough, we néed goe no further. For hée will make men our friends: yea hée will make An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, &amp; all creatures to be ſeruiceable vnto vs: he
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13922:57"/>
will giue them a ſpeciall charge to looke to vs, to guard vs, and to doe continuall homage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. Therefore let vs make God our friend, and then haue we done all at once, that may concerne our good, both for this life, and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But if he ſtand not our friend, if wée haue not him on our ſide, if he backe vs not, then all other things whatſoeuer, can do vs no good: all<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> is not worth a button. For <hi>Quid prodeſt, ſi om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia habes, eum tamen, qui omnia dedit, non habere?</hi> What is a man the better though hée haue all things, and be without him which is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all things?</p>

               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>Herein you ſpeake very truely, no doubt. For wee ſee, many haue great plenty of outward things: but becauſe they haue not God, they can haue no true comfort in them, or bleſſing with them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>True indéed: <hi>For man liueth not by bread onely</hi> (ſaith our Lord Jeſus) <hi>but by<note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> And againe he ſaith: <hi>Though a man<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note> haue abundance, yet his life conſiſteth not in the things that he hath. For</hi> without Gods bleſſing, there can be no ſound comfort in any thing. Wée ſée by dayly experience, how the Lord curſeth the wicked, though they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance. <hi>For,</hi> ſome hauing abundance, yet are viſited with continual ſickneſſes. Some hauing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13922:57"/>
abundance, pine away with conſumptions. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hauing abundance die of ſurfetting. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are ſnatched away by vntimely death, in the middeſt of all their iollitie. Others are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with great loſſes both by ſea and by land. Others are vexed with curſt wiues, and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient children. Some againe commit mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and treaſons, and ſo loſe all at once. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are waſted and conſumed, by the ſecret curſe of God; no man knoweth how. Some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing great riches, are giuen ouer to the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, ſome to the theefe, ſome to the poiſoner. Therefore the wiſe king ſaith: <hi>There is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſickneſſe vnder the ſun; riches reſerued to the owners thereof, for their euill. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi>
                  </hi> 5. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zophar</hi> alſo, the <hi>Naamathite,</hi> ſaith; <hi>When<note place="margin">Iob 20. 22.</note> the wicked ſhall haue ſufficient and enough, he ſhall be brought into ſtraits: The hand of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry troubleſome man ſhall be vpon him. When he ſhould fill his belly, God will ſend vpon him his fierce wrath: which he ſhall raine vpon him in ſtead of his meat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then it is cleare, that mans life and good eſtate, dependeth not vpon the abundance of outward things, but only vpon the bleſſing and prouidence of God. For, <hi>His bleſſing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maketh rich, and it doth bring no ſorrow<note place="margin">Pro. 10. 12. Pſa. 37. 16.</note> with it.</hi> For, <hi>Better is a little vnto the inſt, then great abundance to many of the wicked. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:13922:58"/>
                  <hi>is a little with the feare of the Lord, than<note place="margin">Pro. 25. 16. Pro. 16. 8.</note> great treaſure, and trouble therewith. Better is a little with righteouſneſſe, then great reuenews, without equity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then I conclude this point. Man liueth not by bread, but by a bleſſing vpon bread; not by outward meanes, but by a bleſſing vpon meanes. For how can bread, being a dead thing, and hauing no life in it ſelfe, giue life to others?</p>

               <p>Thereby is meant, the decrée, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and prouidence of God, which vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all things, euen the whole order of nature:</p>
               <p>For the Scripture ſaith: <hi>He ſpake and it was<note place="margin">Pſal. 33. 9.</note> done: he commanded and they were created;</hi> In which words we plainly ſée, that God doth but ſpeake, and it is done: he doth command, and all creatures are preſerued. For <hi>God</hi> doth all things with a word. He created all with his word: he preſerueth all with his word: he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth &amp; it is done. His words are words of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, &amp; authority. Whatſoeuer he ſaith, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he calleth for, it muſt be done preſently, without any delay, there is no withſtanding of him. He calleth for famine, and behold famine. He calleth for plenty, and behold plenty. He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13922:58"/>
for peſtilence, and behold peſtilence. He calleth for the ſword, and behold the ſword. All Angels, all men, all beaſts, all fiſhes, all fowles, all creatures whatſoeuer muſt obey him, and be at his beck. He is the greateſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander: his word commandeth heauen and earth and the ſea. All creatures muſt be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his will, and ſubiect to his ordinance.</p>
               <p>This is the cauſe, why all things both in heauen, earth, and the ſea, do kéepe their immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and vnuariable courſes, times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, euen becauſe he hath charged them ſo to doe. And they muſt of neceſſity alwaies, at all times, and for euer obey, for the creatures muſt obey the Creator. This act of Parliament was made the firſt wéeke of the world, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince was or can be repealed.</p>

               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>But to call you backe againe, to the point we had in hand: reſolue me, I pray you, of this; Whether many of the deare children of God, do not in this life ſometimes want out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, and are brought into great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Yes certainly. For <hi>Eliah</hi> did want, &amp;<note place="margin">1 Reg 17. 2. Cor. 1. 8. 2. Cor. 11. 25. Heb. 11. 36.</note> was in diſtreſſe. <hi>Paul</hi> did want, &amp; was in many diſtreſſes. The holy Chriſtians, mentioned in the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> did want, and were in maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous diſtreſſes. Many of Gods deare ones haue in all ages wanted, and at this day alſo doe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13922:59"/>
want, and are greatly diſtreſſed. But this is a moſt infallible truth, that howſoeuer Gods children may want, &amp; be low brought; yet they are neuer vtterly forſaken, but are holpen euen in greateſt extremities: yea, when all things are deſperate, and brought euen to the laſt caſt.</p>
               <p>To this point, moſt notably ſpeaketh the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaying; <hi>Wee are afflicted on euery ſide, but yet we deſpaire not: we are perſecuted, but<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 8.</note> not forſaken: caſt downe, but wee periſh not.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> alſo ſaith; <hi>The Lord will<note place="margin">Lament. 3.</note> not forſake for euer: but though hee ſend affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet will be haue compaſſion, according to the multitude of his mercies. For hee doth not puniſh willingly, or from his heart, nor afflict the children of men.</hi> The kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith; <hi>Surely the Lord will not faile his<note place="margin">Pſal. 94. 14. Eſa. 55. 8.</note> people, neither will hee forſake his inheritance.</hi> The Lord himſelfe ſaith; <hi>For a moment in mine anger, I hid my face from thee; but with euerlaſting mercy haue I had compaſſion on thee.</hi> So then we may fully aſſure our ſelues, and euen write of it (as a moſt vndoubted and ſealed truth) that Gods children ſhall neuer be vtterly forſaken, in their troubles.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>Sith the care and prouidence of God is ſo great for his children, as you haue largely declared: what then I pray you is the cauſe, why God ſuffereth his to bee brought into ſo many
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13922:59"/>
troubles and neceſſities.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Their profit and benefit is the cauſe, and not their hurt. <hi>For</hi> he loueth them, when he ſmiteth them: Hée fauoureth them, when hée ſéemeth to be moſt againſt them. He aymeth at their good, when he ſéemeth to bée moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them. He woundeth them, that hée may heale them. He preſſeth them, that he may eaſe them. He maketh them cry, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they may laugh. He alwaies meaneth well vnto them, he neuer meaneth hurt. He is moſt conſtant in his loue towards them. If he bring them into neceſſities, it is but for the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of their faith, loue, patience, and diligence in prayer.</p>
               <p>If he caſt them into the fire, it is not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them, but to purge and refine them. If he bring them into great dangers, it is but to make them call vpon him more earneſtly, for helpe and deliuerance.</p>
               <p>He preſſeth vs, that we might cry: we crie, that we may be heard: we are heard, that we might be deliuered. So that héere is no hurt done: we are worſe ſcared, then hurt.</p>
               <p>Euen as a mother, when her childe is way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, threatneth to throw it to the Wolfe, or ſcareth it with ſome pocar, or bul-begger, to make it cling more vnto her and bée quiet: So the Lord oftentimes ſheweth vs the terrible
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:13922:60"/>
faces of troubles and dangers, to make vs cleane and cling faſter vnto him: and alſo to teach vs to eſteeme better of his gifts when wée enioy them, and to be more thankfull for them; as health, wealth, peace, liberty, ſafety, &amp;c. So then ſtill we ſée, here is nothing meant on Gods part, but good: As it is written; <hi>All things worke together for good, to them that loue<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> God.</hi> For euen the afflictions of Gods children<note place="margin">Heb 12. 10. Heb. 12. 14. 1. Theſ. 1. 6. Gal. 6. 14. Phil. 3. 10. 1 Cor. 11. 32. Rom. 5. 3. 4.</note> are ſo ſanctified vnto them by the ſpirit, that thereby they are made partakers of Gods holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thereby they inioy the quiet fruit of righteouſneſſe. Thereby they attaine vnto a greater meaſure of ioy in the holy ghoſt. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the world is crucified to them, and they to the world. Thereby they are made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to Chriſts death. Thereby they are kept from the condemnation of the world. Therby they learne experience, patience, hope, &amp;c. So that, all things conſidered, Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are no loſers by their afflictions, but gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. It is better for them to haue them, then to be without them: they are very good for them. For when Gods children are chaſtiſed, it is as it ſhould bée. For to them, the croſſe is mercy, and loſſe is gaine. Afflictions are their ſchooling, and aduerſity their beſt Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity.<note place="margin">Pſa. 119. 27.</note>

                  <hi>that I haue beene afflicted, that I might learne thy ſtatutes.</hi> By his afflictions therefore, hée learned much, and became a good ſcholar in Gods booke, and well ſéene in his Statutes and Lawes. Hée grew to great wiſedome and iudgement by his chaſtiſments. All things turned about, in Gods mercifull prouidence, to his euerlaſting comfort. For I ſay againe, and againe, that all things tend to the good of Gods choſen people. And therefore that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, which GOD will haue his children to bée in, is alwaies beſt for them. Becauſe hée, who can beſt diſcerne what is beſt, ſéeth it to bée beſt for them: whether it bée ſickneſſe or health, pouerty or plenty, priſon or liberty, proſperity or aduerſity. For ſometimes ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is better for vs then health, and pouerty then plenty. Are therefore the children of God ſicke? it is beſt for them. Are they poore? it is beſt for them. Are they in any trouble? it is beſt for them: becauſe their good Father will turne it to the beſt. Hee will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes cut vs ſhort of our luſts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; becauſe hée ſeeth wée will bane our ſelues with them. Hée, in fatherly care, will take the knife from vs; becauſe hée ſéeth wée will hurt our ſelues with it. He will kéepe vs ſhort of health, and wealth, becauſe hée knoweth wee will bée the worſe for them.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:13922:61"/>
He will not giue vs too much eaſe, and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this world; for he knoweth it will poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vs. He will not allow vs continuall reſt, like ſtanding pondes: for then he knoweth we will gather ſcum and filth. He dealeth father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and mercifully with vs in all things, euen then ſeeking our greateſt good, when we thinke he doth vs moſt harme.</p>
               <p>And to ſpeake all in a word; hée bringeth vs into troubles and ſtraits, to this end eſpecially, that he may heare of vs. For he right wel kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth our nature: he is wel acquainted with our diſpoſition. He knoweth we will not come at him, but when we ſtand in neede of him: we care not for him, ſo long as all goeth well with vs. But if we come into diſtreſſe, or want any thing that we would faine haue, then he is ſure to heare of vs. As he ſaith by the Prophet: <hi>In<note place="margin">Hoſ. 5. 15.</note> their affliction, they will ſeeke me early.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And another Prophet ſaith; <hi>Lord, in trouble<note place="margin">Eſa. 26. 16.</note> haue they viſited thee.

               <p>Yes verily: and (out of doubt) ſo far foorth, as God ſéeth it good for them. For it is written: <hi>Great are the troubles of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;<note place="margin">Pſ. 34. 20.</note> but the Lord deliuereth them out of all.</hi> S.

It is ſaid of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> being in priſon: that, <hi>when his appointed<note place="margin">Pſ. 105. 19. 20.</note> time was come, and the counſell of the Lord had tried him, the King ſent and looſed him, the Ruler of the people deliuered him.</hi> And againe, the Scripture ſaith; <hi>The righteous cry, and the<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.</note> Lord heareth them, and deliuereth them out of all their troubles.

                  <hi>Becauſe hee hath loued mee, therefore I will deliuer him. I will exalt him, becauſe he hath knowen my name. Hee ſhall call vpon mee in trouble, and I will heare him.

Therefore let vs know for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety, that ſo ſure as trouble and affliction are to the Children of God, ſo ſure alſo is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance out of the ſame. As we may write of the one, and make reckoning of it as ſure as the coat of our backe; ſo may we alſo, in Gods good time, write of the other, and make full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it as ſure as the Lord is true. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was in trouble; but deliuered. <hi>Iob</hi> in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but deliuered. <hi>Dauid</hi> in great troubles; but deliuered.

               <p>Aſſuredly there is no cauſe at all; but rather cauſe why they ſhould reioyce, clap their hands, and ſing care away.

For they haue a true title, &amp; proper intereſt, through Chriſt in all the creatures. Many are their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges, great are their prerogatiues.

They are frée from ſinne, frée from hell, frée from damnation. They are at peace with God, men &amp; Angels. They are at peace with themſelues. They are at peace with all creatures. They are yong Princes, Angels fellowes, deſcended of the higheſt houſe, of the bloud royall of heauen, ſtates of Paradiſe, and heires apparent to the immortall Crowne. Therefore God hath commanded his Angels to guard them, being ſuch yong Princes as they are: yea, he hath giuen a very ſtraight charge to all his creatures, to look to them, to ſée to them, that they want nothing, that they take us hurt; ſo teaſous, ſo chary, ſo tender is he of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

But this is moſt certain and ſure, that the beſt is behind with the children of God: all the ſwéet is to come. Their happines doth not appeare in this world. <hi>Their life is<note place="margin">Col. 3. 3. 4.</note> hid with Chriſt in God.

               <p>You haue vttered a great, and a moſt certaine truth. For there is no affliction or trial, which <hi>God</hi> impoſeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his children, but if they endure it quietly, truſt in his mercy firmely, and tary his good pleaſure obediently, it hath a bleſſed and comfortable end. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people of God may well be merry, in the middeſt of their ſorrowes. They may, with patience &amp; comfort, ſubmit themſelues to their Fathers corrections; taking them patiently, and euen kiſſing his holy rod, and ſaying in themſelues: Sith my Father will haue it ſo. I am content; ſéeing it is his minde, I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling withall. As old <hi>Ely</hi> ſaid: <hi>It is the Lord, let<note place="margin">1.

They know all ſhall end well; and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them glad to thinke of it. I conclude then, that the children of God are happy, in what ſtate ſoeuer they are: happy in trouble, happy out of trouble, happy in pouertie, happy in<note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> plenty, bleſſed in ſickneſſe, bleſſed in health, bleſſed at home likewiſe, and abroad, and euery way bleſſed.

For all things worke together, for their deſtruction. Nothing doth them any good. They are not any thing the better, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Gods mercies or iudgements. All wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are alike vnto them. They are alwayes the ſame, in proſperitie and aduerſity: they are no changelings.

               <p>This ſinne is of another nature, then the former. It is a ſinne againſt the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It toucheth the perſon of God himſelfe. For to contemne the Goſpell, is to contemne God himſelfe; whoſe Goſpell it is. If to contemne the Miniſters of the Goſpell, be to contemne <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as our Lord Jeſus auoucheth <hi>(Luke 10. 16.)</hi> how much more then, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the Goſpell it ſelfe? Therefore it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous meddling in this ſinne. It is to meddle with edged tooles, to meddle with princes mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to touch the Arke, to come héere the holy mountain: which all were things full of great perill and danger. Yea, it is to ſpill the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is <hi>Noli me tangere.</hi> It is to raile at a King. It is to ſpit God in the face. It is high treaſon againſt the King of glory. Therefore this ſinne, of all other, can neuer be endured; and may, at no hand, be borne withall. For can a mortall King endure the contempt of his lawes? can he put vp the contempt of his owne perſon? Can he abide any to ſpit at his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to throw a ſtone at it? No ſurely, hée will not.</p>

               <p>You haue ſpoken moſt truly, and alſo ſhewed it out of the Scriptures, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Goſpell is a moſt hainous ſin: yet for all that, it is moſt lamentable to conſider, how little men eſteeme it, and how light they make of it. Many regard it, no more then an eg-ſhell; they thinke it is not worth a gally half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny; they will not goe to the doore to heare it; they take it to be but a breath from vs, and a ſound to them: and ſo the matter is ended. They eſteeme it but as a noiſe, or empty ſound, in the aire; or, as a voice afar off, which a man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not: they neuer felt the power of it in their hearts. Therefore they preferre their ſheep, their Farmes, their Oxen, their profits, their pleaſure, yea euery thing before it; they know it not to be any ſuch pretious iewell, as it is.

bee compared vnto it: yet theſe beaſts, theſe dogs and hogs of the world contemne it. They eſteeme a cow more, then Chriſts moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Goſpell. They are like Eſops cocke, which made more account of a Barlie corne, then all the pretious ſtones in the World: they are like little children, that eſteeeme their rattles, more then a bag of gold: they are like the Gadarenes, which eſteemed their Hogs, more then Chriſt and his Goſpell: they make nothing of it. They thinke it not worth the while. Many of them ſit idle in the ſtreets euen vpon the Sabboths. While the Goſpell is preached in their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, many are at cards, and tables, in Ale-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Many, vpon the Sabboths, ſleep vpon their beds, all the Sermon while, in the after-noone. Many will heare a Sermon in the fore-noone: and they take that to be as much as God can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at their hand, and that he is ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden vnto them for it; but as for the afternoon they will heare none: then they will to bowles or Tables. Theſe men ſerue God in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, and the diuell in the afternoone; ſome run after whores and harlots on the Sabboths; ſome run to dancing and bear-baitings; ſome ſit vpon their ſtalles; ſome ſit in their ſhops; ſome by the fire ſide; ſome ſit idly in the ſtreets; ſome goe to the ſtoole-ball, and other looke on.

O monſtrous hel-hounds: which ſo groſly and openly contemne the Goſpell of Chriſt! What will become of them in the end? Aſſuredly their damnation ſleepeth not.

               <p>You haue ſpoken a truth. And wée haue heard before how the old world was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued for it. And wée read how grieuouſly the Jewes were aſflicted by the Romanes for this ſin: as our <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> did plainly foretell. We read alſo, that after the Lord had broached the Goſpell himſelfe, and ſpread it abroad by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, conquering the world thereby (which thing was ſignified by the white horſe, his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, his bow and his crowne) and yet ſhortly after, ſaw that the ſame began to be contemned<note place="margin">Apoc. 6. 2.</note> in the world and made light of; then hée did in moſt fearfull manner plague the earth with warres, blood-ſheddings, tumults, dearth, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and peſtilence: which all are ſignified by the red horſe, the black horſe, and the pale horſe, which did appeare at the opening of the ſecond, third, and fourth ſeale. So likewiſe vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:13922:70"/>
                  <hi>God</hi> will ſeuerely puniſh all iniuries, wrongs, &amp; contempts, done to his faithfull em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours; as appeareth <hi>Apocal. 11. 5.</hi> where it is ſet downe, that if any would hurt the two witneſſes with their two Oliues, and two can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, (whereby is ſignified the faithfull Preachers of the Goſpell, with all their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall treaſures and heauenly light) fire ſhould procéed out of their mouthes, and deuoure their aduerſaries. That is, the fire of Gods wrath ſhould conſume all that had oppreſſed them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by mockes, flouts, railings, ſlaunders, impriſonment, or any other kinde of indignity. Of this we haue a plaine example or two, in the Scripture. Firſt, we read how fire came downe from Heauen, and conſumed the contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<note place="margin">2. King 1. 10. 2. King. 1. 23.</note> captain and his fifty, at the threatning and calling for of <hi>Eliah.</hi> Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, how two Beares came out of the forreſt, and tare in péeces 42. yonkers, which mocked <hi>Eliſhah</hi> the Prophet of God; calling him bald-head, bald-pate. So then by theſe examples, it is manifeſt, that howſoeuer the Lord may wink at theſe things for a time, and make as though hée ſaw them not: yet the time will come, when he will raine fire and brimſtone vpon all the ſcoffers of his faithfull Miniſters; and contemners of his Goſpell. All this is plainly declared in the 5. Chapter of the Prouerbs of <hi>Salomon:</hi> where
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13922:71"/>
is ſhewed how the wiſedome of God, euen Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the higheſt wiſdome, doth cry aloud all abroad in the world, and manifeſt himſelfe in the open ſtréets: but yet is contemned of wicked worldlings and ſcoffing fooles.

cannot be, that the true feare of God, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſwearing ſhould dwel togither in one man: ſith ſwearing is a thing forbidden by flat ſtatute.

there is no ſinne more common amongſt vs then ſwearing. For many there be which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeake ten words, but one ſhall bee an oath.

For it is made naturall vnto them, through cuſtome: and they haue got the habit of it. I doe verily thinke, if it were high Treaſon to ſweare, yet ſome could not leaue ſwearing. And ſure I am (as light as we make of it) that it is high Treaſon againſt the crowne of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Yea, it is a ſinne immediately againſt God: euen againſt his owne perſon.

               <p>Oh what a lamentable thing is it! We may well take vp the old complaint of the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> who ſaith; that in his time <hi>the Land did mourne, becauſe of oathes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 23. 20.</note> And we may wel wonder, that the land ſinketh not becauſe of oathes. <hi>For,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> were not a <hi>God</hi> of infinite patience, how could he endure his moſt ſacred and glorious name to be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand times blaſphemed in one day? and that, by ſuch miſerable wretches as we be.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>Wee may indeed admire and wonder at the patience and long ſuffering of God, that hee ſpareth vs ſo long, and giueth vs ſo large a time of repentance; but ſure it is that the Prophet ſaith; That, howſoeuer the Lord is ſlow to anger, yet he is great in power, and will not ſurely cleare the wicked. Though he<note place="margin">Nah. 1. 3.</note> may winke at their monſtrous oathes for a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13922:76"/>
time, yet he forgetteth them neuer a whit, but ſcoreth them vp, and regiſtreth them in his booke of accounts; ſo as they ſtand in record againſt them. And when the great day of rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning ſhall come, he will ſet them all in order before them, and lay them to their charge.</p>
               <p>Let not wicked ſwearers and blaſphemers therefore think that they ſhal alwaies ſcape ſcot-free, becauſe God letteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone for a while, and deferreth their puniſhment. For the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger God deferreth, the more terrible will his ſtrokes bee when they come. The longer an arrow is held in the bowe, the ſtronger will bee the ſhot when it commeth foorth. Though God haue leaden feete, and commeth ſlowly to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute wrath, yet hath he an iron hand, and will ſtrike deadly when he commeth. Though God giueth the wicked ſecurity for a time (ſaith<note place="margin">Iob 24. 23.</note> Iob) yet his eyes are fixed vpon all their waies. And in an other place he ſaith; The wicked is reſerued vnto the day of deſtruction, and they ſhall be brought forth vnto the day of wrath <note place="margin">Iob 21. 30</note>. So then the holy man Iob plainely affirmeth, that the ſtate and condition of all the rich and wealthy worldlings is, as the condition of an Oxe that is fatted vp againſt the day of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For in the ſame Chapter hee ſaith; They<note place="margin">Iob. 21.</note> ſpend their daies in wealth, and ſuddenly goe downe to hell. But now I pray you nominate

               <p>Yes indéed do I. For our faith and our troth are the moſt pretious iewels we haue. Shall we then lay them to gage, for euery word we ſpeake?

The Lord ſaith by his Prophet <hi>Ieremie: They haue forſaken me, and<note place="margin">Iere. 5. 7.</note> ſworne by them that are no Gods.</hi> So then to ſweare by creatures, is to forſake God.

               <p>You, and ſuch as you are, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue no more of the word of God, then will ſtand with your fantaſie.

But this I wil ſay vnto you, becauſe you think it ſo ſmal a matter to ſwear by creatures; that the more baſe and vile the thing is which you ſware by, the greater is the oath: becauſe you aſcribe that vnto a baſe creature, which is onely proper to God: namely to know our hearts, and to be a diſcerner of ſecret things. For whatſoeuer a man ſweareth by, he calleth it as a witneſſe vnto his conſcience, that hée ſpeaketh the truth, and lieth not: which thing onely belongeth vnto God. And therefore in ſwearing by creatures, wée doe rob God of his honour. Therefore to ſweare by the croſſe of the money, or by bread, or a mouſe foot, or
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13922:78"/>
the fire which they call Gods Angell, or any ſuch like, is a robbing of God of his Honour, and an aſcribing of that to the creature, which is proper onely to the Creator.</p>

               <p>Their ſinne is as great as the other. For it is an hainous thing to ſweare by idoles: as S. <hi>Mary,</hi> our Ladie, by the Maſſe, by the Rood, &amp;c.

               <p>This is warranted from Gods owne mouth, where he ſaith: <hi>Thou ſhalt ſweare, The Lord<note place="margin">Iere. 4.</note> liueth, in truth, in iudgement, and in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</hi> And in theſe caſes onely, the name of God is to be ſworne by; as it is written: <hi>Thou<note place="margin">Deut. 10. 20.</note> ſhalt feare the Lord thy God, and thou ſhalt ſerue him, and ſhalt cleaue vnto him, and ſhalt ſweare by his name.</hi>

                  <hi>for two cauſes: either to deliuer thy ſelfe from ſome grieuous crime and accuſation, or elſe to preſerue thy friends from danger.</hi> So then that<note place="margin">Iſocra. ad Demon.</note> Heathen man in common talke, wil not allow any oath, much leſſe, to ſweare by God.

               <p>Swearing and lying be of very néere kindred. For he that is a common ſwearer, is for the moſt part a common lier alſo. For hee that maketh no conſcience of ſwearing, will make no conſcience of lying. And as the Lord hateth the one, ſo alſo he hateth the other. And as he puniſheth the one, ſo he will puniſh the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith: <hi>Lying lips are<note place="margin">Pro. 12. 22.

               <p>Theſe ſcriptures, which you alleadge, doe manifeſtly declare that God abhorreth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and hath reſerued great torments for them. Therefore the princely Prophet Dauid ſaith, that he would baniſh all liers out of his houſe.<note place="margin">Pſa. 101. 7.</note> He that telleth lies (ſaith he) ſhal not remaine in my ſight.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13922:81"/>

For it is hard to finde a man that will ſpeake the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth from his heart, in ſimplicity and plainneſſe, at all times, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and amongſt all perſons, without all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing or diſſembling, either for feare, gaine, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, men-pleaſing, hiding of faults, or any ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter reſpect whatſoeuer. Where, I ſay, is this man to be found? I would fain ſee him. I would faine looke vpon ſuch a man. It would doe my heart good to behold him. I would reioyce to ſet mine eyes vpon ſuch a man.</p>

               <p>Such a man, as you ſpeake of, is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found among the ſonnes of men. They be blacke Swans in the earth, they be white crowes: they be rare birds. For there be very few that will ſpeake the truth from their heart: yet ſome ſuch I hope there be. But, for the moſt part, &amp; amongſt the greater ſort, lying, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and fraud, do beare all the ſway. There is no truth, no honeſty, no conſcience, no ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, no plaine dealing, amongſt men in theſe moſt corrupt times. Faith and truth are parted cleane away. And as the kingly prophet ſaith: <hi>The faithfull are failed, from among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<note place="margin">Pſal. 12.</note> of men. They ſpeake deceitfully euery one with his neighbour; flattering with their lippes, and ſpeake with a double heart.</hi> Men now adayes ſtudie the Arte of lying, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:13922:82"/>
fawning, gloſing and diſſembling: they haue a heart and a heart. They haue hony in their mouth; and gall in their heart. Their tongues are as ſoft as butter and oile: but their hearts are full of bitterneſſe, poiſon and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. They are full of outward courteſie and ciuility, full of court holy water, when there is no truth nor plaineneſſe in their inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They will ſpeake you faire, when they would cut your throats. They will ſhew you a good countenance; when they would eate your heart with garlicke. In outward ſhew, they will carry themſelues plauſibly, when their hearts are full of venome &amp; malice. This vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous brood do but watch their times &amp; opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, till they can get a man vpon the hip: and then they will ſting him, &amp; worke their malice vpon him. Theſe fauning curs will not barke till they bite. They will lurke, and lie cloſe, til they ſpie their vantage, and then they wil ſhew themſelues in their kinde: then they will hoiſt a man, and turne him ouer the perke, if they can. Theſe men are like the waters, which are moſt déepe, where they are moſt calme: like a dangerous rocke, hid vnder a calme ſea; or, as the Heathen ſay, like the <hi>Syrens</hi> ſong, which is the Sailers wrecke; like the Fowlers whiſtle, which is the birds death; like the hid bait, which is the fiſhes bane; like the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes,</hi>

               <p>True it is, we may maruell at the long ſuffering of God in this behalfe. But this is to be noted, that God doth not immediatly puniſh all notorious ſinners in this life: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth thouſands to the iudgment of the great day. In this life he onely culleth out ſome few, whom hée ſmiteth for the example of others, that they might feare and tremble, and learne by other mens harmes to beware.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:13922:84"/>Therefore, euen in this life, we ſée before our eies, ſome liers, ſome drunkards, ſome whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, ſome ſwearers, ſome miſers of the world, ſome ruffians, and cut-throats, ſtriken downe, by the reuenging hand of God. But whereas God ſmiteth one of theſe, in this life, he letteth an hundred eſcape. For if he ſhould puniſh all offenders in this life, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhould the iudgement to come ſerue? If he ſhould puniſh none, then we would think there were no God, or that he were ſhut vp idle in heauen, and would doe neither good, nor euill, nor once meddle in the matters of the earth: as ſome Epicures haue dreamed. Therefore, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid both theſe extremities, <hi>God</hi> in his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſedome hath thought good to méet with ſome, euen in this world.</p>

Therefore it is ſaid: <hi>The bread of deceit is<note place="margin">Pro. 10. 17.</note> ſweet to a man: but afterward his mouth ſhall be filled with grauell.</hi> That is, in the end the crafty perſon ſhall méet with many troubles. <hi>For</hi> either his conſcience will vpbraid him and checke him, or vengeance will plague him, for his deceit. The feares, cares and ſorrowes, which he ſhall haue, ſhall be as it were ſo many ſharpe ſtones, to ſet his téeth on edge, and to vex him. Wherefore, in ſtead of meat, he ſhall féed on grauell: and in ſtéed of wheat, on pebble ſtones. Small pleaſure is taken in the end in goods ill gotten, or liuings vnlawfully come by. <hi>For</hi> the holy Ghoſt hath paſſed ſentence vpon them, that they ſhall neuer proſper.</p>

               <p>Yes. For we read how the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nits,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioſ. 9. 23.</note> for their lying and diſſembling, were made drudges and ſlaues to the <hi>Iſraelites.

               <p>Oh therefore that wee could follow<note place="margin">Col. 3. 9.</note> the counſell of the Apoſtle, who ſaith: Lie not one to another: ſith yee haue put off the old man, with his workes. And againe: Caſt<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 5.</note> away lying, and ſpeake euery one the truth to his neighbour. The maner of ſpeech which the Apoſtle vſeth is very forcible, implying this much; that we ſhould in a kinde of diſdaine or deteſtation, caſt it away, and throw it from vs, as a filthy, ſtinking and beraied clout, hanging about a mans necke: which hee doth ſuddenly ſnatch away, and hurleth into the

Would to God therefore that we were come to ſuch a deteſtation and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of lying, that we would euen ſpattle at it, &amp; crie fie vpon it, and all that vſe it! Oh that we could hate it as the diuel, which is the father of<note place="margin">Homer. Iliad. 3.</note> it; &amp; as hel fire, which is the reward of it!

               <p>It is ſo brutiſh and beaſtly a ſinne, that a man would thinke, it ſhould not néed to be ſpoken againſt: but that all reaſonable men ſhould euen abhorre it, &amp; quake to thinke of it. For it is a moſt ſwiniſh thing: it maketh of a man, a beaſt: it taketh away the heart of a man from all goodneſſe, as witneſſeth the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Whoredome, wine, and new<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4 11.</note> wine, take away their heart.</hi> For, what heart, what ſtomacke, what appetite can whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and drunkards haue to any thing that is good? either to heare or read the word of God, or to pray or to meditate in the ſame? Alas, they are farre from it, farre from God, and far from all grace and goodneſſe. Therefore the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> ſaith: <hi>Awake yee drunkards: weepe and<note place="margin">Ioel. 1. 5.</note> howle yee drinkers of wine.</hi> Yea, the mighty God of heauen doth pronounce a woe againſt them, ſaying: <hi>Woe vnto them that riſe vp ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Eſa. 5. 11.</note> to follow drunkenneſſe: and to them that continue vntill night, till the wine doe enflame them.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus himſelfe giueth vs a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat, to take héed of it: <hi>Take heed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that<note place="margin">Luke. 22. 24.</note> your hearts be not ouercome with ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe, and the cares of this life: and ſo that day come vpon you vnawares.</hi> Thus you heare, how both <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, and ſundry of the Prophets, do thunder downe from heauen

               <p>True indeed. But yet almoſt nothing wil make men leaue it: for it is a moſt rife and ouer common vice. We ſee many, that think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſome bodies (and as we ſay, no ſmall fools) which yet will be ouertaken with it: and thereby loſe all their credit and reputation with all wiſe men: yea, do proue themſelues to bee but ſwine, and bruit beaſts, as the holy Ghoſt auoucheth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:<note place="margin">Pro. 21. 1.</note> Wine is a mocker &amp; ſtrong drink is raging: Whoſoeuer is deceiued therein, is not wiſe.</p>

Behold then what be the curſed fruits and euents of drunkenneſſe.

So then I conclude, that drunkenneſſe is a vice more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéeming an hogge, then any reaſonable man.

to amaze and ſtrike thorow the hearts of all drunkards in the world: For it is as much in effect, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid: All drunkards are notorious Reprobates, and hell-hounds, branded of Sathan, and deuoted to perpetuall deſtruction and damnation.</p>
               <p>But you ſay, you meane no hurt. I anſwer, whatſoeuer you meane, your actions are naught, and your fellowſhip as bad.

               <p>Well Sir you haue waded farre enough in this point: let vs now come to the eighth ſigne of condemnation: which is idleneſſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Concerning idleneſſe, this I ſay briefely: that it is the mother of all vice, and the ſtepdame of all vertue: yea, it is the very vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame of all enormities: It is the mother of whoredome, the mother of pride, the mother of theft, the mother of drunkenneſſe, the mother of ignorance, the mother of error, the mother of pouerty, the mother of ſlandering and back-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, pratling, and goſſipping, brawling, ſcol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, quarelling: and what not? Idleneſſe was one of the principall ſinnes of <hi>Sodome,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> teſtifieth, ſaying: <hi>pride, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<note place="margin">Ezech. 16. 29.</note> of bread, and abundance of idleneſſe was in her, and in her daughters. Salomon</hi> is very plentifull in this matter: For, ſaith he, <hi>the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard<note place="margin">Pro. 13. 4.</note> luſteth and hath nought.</hi> And againe: <hi>The ſluggard is wiſer in his owne conceit, then<note place="margin">Pro. 16. 16.</note> ſeuen men that can giue a ſenſible reaſon.</hi> That
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:13922:90"/>
is; he taketh himſelfe the wiſeſt of many; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hée ſpareth his body, when others take<note place="margin">Pro. 24. 33.</note> paines: he ſaith; <hi>Yet a little ſleepe, yet a little ſlumber, yet a little folding of the hands: and his pouerty commeth like a traueller;</hi> that is vnawares: <hi>and his neceſſity like an armed man:</hi> that is ſtrongly. Then <hi>he foldeth his<note place="margin">Eccl. 4. 5. Pro 26. 15.</note> hands together, and eateth his owne fleſh. For, he hideth his hand in his boſome: and it weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to put it to his mouth againe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In an other place the holy Ghoſt ſaith: <hi>The ſlothful man will not plough, becauſe of winter: Therefore he ſhall begge in ſommer, and haue nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe: <hi>the ſlothfull man is brother to him<note place="margin">Pro. 16. 8.</note> that is a great waſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer it is ſaid, that <hi>the ſluggard turneth<note place="margin">Pro. 26. 14.</note> himſelfe vpon his bed, as the doore doth vpon the hinges:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, he kéepeth his bed, as if he were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to it.</p>
               <p>And, becauſe the Spirit will abound in this point: it is further written of the ſlethfull man that he ſaith; <hi>An huge Lyon is in the way: I<note place="margin">Pro. 26. 11.</note> ſhall be ſlaine in the ſtreets.</hi> That is, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good matter is in hand (as preaching, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading, giuing to the poore, &amp;c.) then hée draweth backe, he ſhrinketh into the ſhell, hée findeth one let or other, one excuſe or other.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:13922:91"/>
Then profit, and pleaſure, buſineſſe, and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, matters at home, and matters abroad, company, and a thouſand occaſions will lye in his way, as ſo many Lions, to let and hinder him. So then we ſée, how liuely and plentifully the holy Scriptures doe paint out the lazy lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this world, and ſons of idleneſſe: which are as hardly drawen to any good thing, as a Beare to the ſtake. As for the duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they goe as liuely and as cheareful about them, as a théefe goeth vp the ladder, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted for his theft.</p>

               <p>I doe plainely ſee, that this ſinne of Idleneſſe is a very groſſe euill, and the root of many vices: yet for al that, there be a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which thinke they were borne to liue idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as many yong Gentlemen, and ſuch like: which imagine, they came into the world for no other purpoſe, but to hunt and hawke, card, and dice, riot and reuell, and to ſpend their daies in pleaſure and vanity. Againe, there be many lazy lozels, and luskiſh youths, both in Townes and Villages, which doe nothing all the day long, but walke in the ſtreetes, ſit vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtaules, and frequent Tauernes and Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes. Many rich Citizens, eſpecially wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, doe ordinarily lie in bed till nine of the clocke, and then forſooth riſe and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ready to goe to dinner. And after they
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:13922:91"/>
haue well dined they ſpend the reſt of the day, and a good part of the night alſo, in playing, pratling, babbling, cackling, prating and goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipping. Fie of this idle life. Many prophane ſeruing men alſo doe falſly ſuppoſe, that they were borne onely to game, riot, ſweare, whore, ruffle it, and roiſt it out, and to ſpend their time in meere idleneſſe.

               <p>It is a lamentable thing to ſée ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men and women liue ſo idlely, and ſo vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably as they doe. For alas, there be too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which fellow no honeſt calling, liue to no vſe, no body is the better for them. They do no good, neither to the Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. They are like drone bées: they are vnprofitable burthens of the earth. God hath no vſe of them, the Church no good, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth no benefit, their neighbours no profite, the poore no reliefe. They imagine, they came into the world, to doe nothing but eate, and drinke, and ſléepe and riſe vp to play. They thinke they ſhould ſpend their time in dicing and dauncing, in whoredome and brauery, in gluttony and belly-chéere: in maſting themſelues, like hogs of <hi>Epicurus</hi> heard: in pampering their paunches, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:13922:92"/>
cramming their bellies: in fatting themſelues like Boares in a Franke, till they bée well brawned: and (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſath) till their bones runne full of marrow, their faces ſtrout with<note place="margin">Iob. 15.

It is more méete for Epicures, then Chriſtians: for ſwine, then for men: for <hi>Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napalus, and Heliogabalus,</hi> and ſuch like belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods, then for the profeſſors of the Goſpel. But, of all ſuch, <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith enough; <hi>They ſpend their<note place="margin">Iob. 21.</note> daies in pleaſure: and ſuddenly goe downe to hell.</hi>

               <p>But may it not bee allowed vnto Lords and Ladies, Gentlemen and gentlewomen, and other great ones, to liue idlely, ſith they haue wherewithall to maintaine it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>God doth allow none to liue idlely: but all, great and ſmall, are to be imploied one way or other: either for the benefit of the Church, or common wealth: or for the good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of their owne houſholds, or for the good of townes and pariſhes, and thoſe amongſt whom they doe conuerſe: or for the ſuccour and reliefe of the poore: or for the furtherance of the Goſpell, and the maintaining of the Miniſtery: or for one good vſe or other. To theſe ends, our wits, our learning, our reading, our ſkill, our policy, our wealth, our health, our wiſedome,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13922:92"/>
and authoritie, are to be referred: knowing this; that one day, we ſhall come to giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our Bally-wicke, and to be reckoned withall, for the employment of our Talents. For this cauſe <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith: that, <hi>man is borne to<note place="margin">Iob. 5. 5. 7.</note> trauell: as the ſparkes flie vpward.</hi> And God hath laid this vpon <hi>Adam,</hi> and al his poſterity:<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>In the ſweat of thy browes, thou ſhalt eat thy bread.</hi> Some doe ſet downe foure cauſes, why euery man ſhould labour diligently in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:</p>
               <p>Firſt, to beare the yoake laid vpon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, by the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to get the neceſſaries of this life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to liue vnto the profit of humane ſocietie.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to auoid euill thoughts and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> findeth great fault with ſome in the Church of <hi>Theſſalonia,</hi> becauſe they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.</note> inordinately, that is idlely, and out of a lawfull calling: and therefore concluded, that ſuch as would not labour, ſhould not eat. So then we do plainly ſée, that God alloweth idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in none. For when we are idle (as hath béen ſhewed before) we lie open to the diuell &amp; his temptations: and he getteth within vs and preuaileth againſt vs. While <hi>Dauid</hi> taried idly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:13922:93"/>
at home in the beginning of the yeare, when kings vſed to goe forth to the battell, he was ſoone ouertaken with thoſe two foule ſinnes of adultery, and man-ſlaughter. So long as <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> warred with the Philiſtims, he could neuer be taken or ouercome: but after he gaue himſelfe to idleneſſe and pleaſure, he not only commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fornication with the ſtrumpet <hi>Dalilah,</hi> but alſo was taken of his enemies, and his eies mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably pulled out. Theſe examples doe ſhew, what a dangerous ſinne idleneſſe is. Therefore the holy Ghoſt ſends vs to ſchoole, to the little creature, the Ant, to learne of her both to auoid idleneſſe, and alſo to vſe wiſedome and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our actions. <hi>Go to the Piſmire, O ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, behold her wayes, and be wiſe: For ſhee,<note place="margin">Pro. 6. 6.</note> hauing no guide, task-maiſter, nor ruler, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth her meat in the ſummer, and gathereth her food in harueſt.</hi> And in goodſooth it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull to obſerue, what indeſinent paines, and vnwearied labour, this ſilly creature taketh in ſummer, that ſhée may be well prouided for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt winter. Let vs therefore learne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from her example: and let vs ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes the looking glaſſe of all creatures. Let vs conſider how the birdes flie, the fiſhes ſwim, the wormes créepe, the heauens turne, the elements mooue, the ſea ebbeth and floweth vnceſſantly: yea the earth it ſelfe, which is the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13922:93"/>
moſt heauy and vnweldy creature of all other, yet neuer ceaſeth his working, bringing foorth his burden in ſummer, and labouring inwardly all the winter, in concocting and digeſting his nouriſhment for the next ſpring. Thus we ſée, how all creatures are diligently and painfully exerciſed in their kindes. And therefore it is a great ſhame for vs to liue idlely, careleſly, and diſſolutely. Let vs therefore learne (once at laſt) to flie ſlath, and euery one to liue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, diligently, and induſtriouſly in our ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall callings. So ſhall wée both kéepe Sathan at the ſtaues end, and alſo much ſinne out of our ſoules; which otherwiſe idleneſſe wil force in vpon vs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt needs confeſſe, that idleneſſe is a groſſe vice in whomſoeuer it is found. But ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, in my iudgement, it is moſt odious in Magiſtrates and Miniſters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>That is ſo in truth. For they ought to be the guides, gouernours, ſhepheards, and watchmen ouer the people of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for them to neglect their duties and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, is a moſt horrible thing, ſith it concerneth<note place="margin">Homer. Iliad. 2.</note> the hurt of many. Therefore well ſaid the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Poet: <hi>A magiſtrate, or a Miniſter, may not be lazie and ſlothfull, to whom the nurſing of the people is giuen in charge, and of whom many things are to be cared for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:13922:94"/>What a lamentable thing therefore is it, when Magiſtrates are prophane, irreligious, popiſh, vicious, and negligent in the duties of their calling? And how much more lamentable is it, when Miniſters neglect their ſtudies, ſlack preaching, and prayer, and giue vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſome to couetouſneſſe, ſome to pride, ſome to husbandrie, ſome to other worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and ſome to ſpend their time idlely in Lauerns, Ale-houſes, gaming, rioting, and lewd company? Would to God therefore that both theſe kind of publike perſons would caſt off idleneſſe and ſlouth; and with diligence, faithfulneſſe, care and conſcience, performe the duties of their places. For it is an excellent thing for any to be a good man in his place: As a good Magiſtrate, that ruleth well, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth wiſely, which fauoureth good men and good cauſes, and defendeth them: which alſo ſetteth himſelfe againſt bad men and bad cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and puniſheth them ſharpely and ſeuerely: which moreouer maintaineth vertue, euen of a very loue he beareth vnto it in his heart: and puniſheth vice of a very zeale and hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: and not for his credit only or to pleaſe ſome, or becauſe he muſt needs doe it, and can doe no leſſe, or for any ſuch ſiniſter reſpect: but euen of a loue to God, a care of his glory, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of dutie, and a feruent zeale againſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:13922:94"/>
ſinne. So likewiſe, it is a notable thing for a Miniſter to be a good man in his place; to bée ſtudious in the law of God, diligent and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in preaching; and that of a loue to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a zeale of his glorie, déepe pity and compaſſion toward the ſoules of the people, ſéeking by all meanes poſſible to winne them vnto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying himſelfe in all his actions amongſt them, wiſely, religiouſly, vnblameably, and in offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely.</p>
               <p>So againe, it is a worthy thing to be a good rich man which doth much good with this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which kéepeth a good houſe, relieueth the poore, miniſtreth to the neceſſity of the Saints, and giueth chéerefully, and with diſcretion, where néed is.</p>
               <p>So alſo, it is a commendable thing to be a good neighbour, or a good Towneſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by whom a man may liue quietly, peaceably, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and comfortably.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, to be a good poore man: that is, humble, lowly, duetifull, painefull, ready to helpe, and ready to pleaſe. Oh, I ſay, this is a moſt excellent and glorions thing, when eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man kéepeth his ſtanding, his range, and his ranke: when all men, with care and conſcience performe the duties of their places: when the huſband doth the duty of an huſband, and the wife of a wife: when the father doth the duety
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:13922:95"/>
of a Father, and the child of a child: when the Maſter doth the duty of a Maſter, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantof a ſeruant: when euery man ſetteth God before his eies, in doing thoſe things, which eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially belong vnto him. For héerein conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the honor of God, the glory of the Prince, the crowne of the Church, the fortreſſe of the Common-wealth, the ſafety of Cities, the ſtrength of kingdomes, and the very preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things.</p>

               <p>You haue ſaid well in ſome things. But yet I doe not ſee, but that rich men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may liue idlely; ſith they haue enough, where withall to maintaine it. For may not a man doe with his owne what he liſt?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>No verily. For you may not take your owne knife, and cut your owne throat with it: neither may you take your owne are, and kill your owne childe with it. Therefore that reaſon is naught. Albeit therefore wealthy men &amp; women haue great plenty of all things, ſo as they néed not to labour; yet let them bée profitably emploied, ſome other way. Let them exerciſe themſelues in one good thing or other. If they can finde nothing to doe, let them giue themſelues much to priuate praiers, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſcriptures, that they may be able to inſtruct and exhort others.

            <sp>

               <p>It is ſo infinite a matter, that I know not where to begin, or where to make an end of it. It is a bottomleſſe ſinke of moſt grieuous enormities. I ſhall enter into a Labyrinth, where I ſhall not know now to get out againe. But ſith you are deſirous to heare ſomething of it, this I ſay, that it is a moſt cruell monſter, a bloody vice, a moſt vgly and hidious fiend of hell. The Scriptures in very many places, do cry out vpon it, arraigning it, adiudging it, and condemning it downe to hell. They doe alſo thunder and lighten vpon all thoſe, which are ſtained and corrupted with this vice; calling them by ſuch names and giuing them ſuch ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, as are taken from the effects of this ſinne, and moſt fit for oppreſſours: as namely, that <hi>they grinde the faces of the poore; that they<note place="margin">Eſa. 3. 15.

Theſe Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillers, and Cormorants of the earth, are like vnto the Whale-fiſh, which ſwalloweth vp

               <p>In truth, this is a moſt cruell and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing age, wherein we liue; yea, a very iron age. It ſeemeth, that the great ones minde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, they are altogether ſet vpon oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they dote and dreame of it, they finde ſweet in it, and therefore they are mad of it. As<note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 5.</note> Salomon ſaith; Oppreſſion maketh a wiſeman mad.

Yet,

no doubt, the moſt wiſe God hath enacted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good lawes for the ſuppreſſing of this euill: and doth threaten the execution of them in his owne perſon: and eſpecially his Law doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the ſafetie of the poore, the fatherleſſe, the widow and the ſtranger.

The

Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>Let no man oppreſſe or defraud<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4. 6.</note> his brother, in any matters. For the Lord is an auenger of all ſuch things.

               <p>But theſe oppreſſing hel-hounds are ſuch as care for nothing. No Law of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty can bridle them: nothing can feare them: nothing can reſtraine them. They haue made a couenant with Hell and death. They are frozen in the dregs; they are paſt feeling. And as Iob ſaith: Theſe are they, that abhorre<note place="margin">Iob. 14. 13.</note> the light, they know not the waies thereof, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continue in the pathes thereof. Their hearts are as hard as the Adamant. Nothing can mooue them: nothing can worke vpon them. There is great crying out euery where of the ſtone in the reines, which indeed is a great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the bodie (but there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the ſtone in the heart. I meane a ſtonie heart: which is the ſoreſt diſeaſe that poſſibly can fall into the ſoule of man) and yet
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:13922:99"/>
in theſe times it groweth very rife. For mens hearts are as hard as braſſe, and as the neather Milſtone: as the Scripture ſpeaketh. For many, eſpecially of theſe vnmercifull and oppreſſing<note place="margin">Zeph. 1. 12. Amos 6. 3. 6.</note> tyrants, ſay in their hearts; God will do neither good nor euill. Therefore they put the euil day far from them, and approch vnto the ſeat of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. They are at eaſe in Zion; they lie vpon beds of Iuory, and ſtretch themſelues vpon their beds; and eat the lambes of the flocke, and the calues out of the ſtall. They ſing to the ſound of the viall; they inuent inſtruments of muſicke, like Dauid. They drink wine in bowles, and no man is ſory for the affliction of Ioſeph; that is, the troubles of Gods people. The Prophet Eſay alſo<note place="margin">Eſa. 5. 12.

               <p>You haue ſpoken very well, touching the ſtéelineſſe and hardnes of theſe mens harts, who are ſo vnmerciful to their poor neighbors, that almoſt none can liue by them. They do ſo
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:13922:99"/>
diſturbe &amp; diſquiet al things, that poore men can dwell in no reſt by them. Therefore truly ſaith the wiſe king: <hi>A mightie man moleſteth all, &amp;<note place="margin">Pro. 18. 2.</note> both hireth the foole, &amp; hireth thoſe that paſſe by. But the poore man ſpeaketh with prayers:</hi> that is, by the way of entreatie and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For the poore are afraid of them. They quake when they ſée them: as the beaſts quake, at the roaring of the Lion. Many poore Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, poore Huſband men, poore Heards, poore Labourers, poore widowes, and hirelings, doe quake and tremble, when theſe gréedy wolues come abroad. <hi>And</hi> (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh) <hi>the poore<note place="margin">Iob. 24. 4.</note> of the earth hide themſelues together.</hi> For (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las) in their hearts, they cannot abide the ſight of them: they had as léeue méet the diuell as méet them, for feare of one diſpleaſure or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For either they feare that they wil warne them out of their houſes, or parley about more rent and ſtraighter couenants, or beg away their beſt kine, or borow their horſes, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their carts, or require a wéeks worke of them, &amp; neuer pay them for it, or a twelue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths paſture for a couple of Geldings, or that they wil make one quarel or another vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or one miſchiefe or another. Se that theſe poore ſoules cannot tel what to do, nor which way to turn them, for feare of theſe cruel termagants. They are euen weary of their liues. For they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:13922:100"/>
haue no remedie for theſe things, but euen to beare it off with head and ſhoulders. Therefore they often with they were out of the world, and that they were buried quicke. They ſay, if any will knocke them on the head, they will forgiue him. O moſt pittious caſe! O lamentable hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring! Theſe poore ſilly creatures are faine to drudge and moile all the yere long, in winter &amp; ſummer, in froſt &amp; ſnow, in heat &amp; cold, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide their rents, that they may be able to pay their cruell Land-lord at his day: For elſe, how ſhall they be able to looke him in the face? Yet their rent is ſo rackt, that all that they can do is little enough to pay it. And when that is paid, (alas) the poore man, &amp; his wife, &amp; children haue little left to take to, or to maintaine themſelues withal: they are faine to gnaw of a cruſt, to fare hardly, &amp; go thinly clad. Sometimes they haue victuals, and ſometimes none. The poore chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren cry for bread. Poore widowes alſo, &amp; poore fatherleſſe children, are found wéeping &amp; mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their houſes, and in their ſtréets. So that now we may with <hi>Salomon, turne and conſider<note place="margin">Eccle. 4. 1.</note> all the oppreſſions, that are wrought vnder the Sun.</hi> Wée may behold the téeres of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and none comforteth them. For the mighty ones do wrong the weaker: euen as the ſtrongen beaſts do puſh and harme the féebler. Theſe gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping oppreſſors do pinch the poore euen to the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:13922:100"/>
quicke. They plucke away from the fatherleſſe and widowes, that little which they haue. If there be but a cowe, or a few ſheepe left, they will haue them. If there be a little commodity of houſe or land, oh what deuiſes they haue to wind it in, &amp; to wring it away! Theſe tyrants will go as nigh, as the bed they lie vpon. They know well inough, the poore men are not able to wage law with them: and therfore they may do what wrong they will, &amp; ſhew what cruelty they liſt. Hence commeth the téeres of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; hence commeth the wéeping &amp; wailing of the poore. But alas (poore ſoules) they may wel wéep, to eaſe their hearts a little; but there is none to comfort them: remedy they can haue none. But yet aſſuredly the euerlaſting God doth looke vpon them, &amp; will be reuenged. For the cries of the poore, the fatherles, and the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, haue entred into the cares of the Lord of Hoſts, who is an auenger of all ſuch things; yea a ſtrong reuenger, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith: <hi>Enter<note place="margin">Pro. 23. 14.</note> not into the field of the fatherleſſe: for their reuenger is ſtrong. He himſelfe will plead their cauſe againſt thee.</hi> And againe he ſaith: <hi>Rob<note place="margin">Pro. 22. 2.</note> not the poore, becauſe hee is poore: neither tread downe the afflicted in the gate: for the Lord pleadeth their cauſe: and will ſpoile their ſoule that ſpoile them.</hi> We ſée then, that the moſt iuſt God wil be reuenged on theſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:13922:101"/>
tyrants. He will not alwaies put vp theſe wrongs and iniuries, done to the poore.</p>
               <p>In the eight chapter of the Prophet <hi>Amos, hee ſweareth by the excellency of Iacob, that hee will neuer forget any of their workes.</hi> And againe, he ſaith by his Prophet <hi>Ieremie; Shall I not be auenged, on ſuch a Nation as this?</hi> Surely he will ſet his face againſt them to root them out of the earth. For indéed they are not worthy to crawle vpon the face of the earth, or to draw breath amongſt the ſonnes of men. It is written in the booke of Pſalmes; that God will ſet their fellowes oppoſite againſt him, as a Butte to ſhoot at: that <hi>he will put them apart:<note place="margin">Pſal. 21. 13.</note> and the ſtrings of his bow ſhall he make ready a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their faces.</hi> Be aſtoniſhed at this, O ye heauens; and tremble, O thou earth.

Turne vnto the Lord, with all your heart, with wéeping, faſting, and mourning; preuent Gods wrath with a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of téeres; pacifie his anger with the calues of your lips, and with a contrite ſpirit; be grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for that which is paſt, and amend that which is to come; ſtand it out no more at the ſwords point againſt God. For it will not boot you to ſtriue; he is too ſtrong for you. Your only wiſdom is, to come in. Come in therfore, come in, ye rebellious generation; ſubmit your ſelues
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:13922:104"/>
to the great King, humble your ſelues vnder his mighty hand: caſt downe your ſwords and targets: yéeld vnto your God. So ſhall you eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the vengeance to come; ſo ſhall God accept you, haue mercy vpon you, receiue you to fauor, grant you a generall pardon for all your rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and admit you into the number of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and loyall ſubiects.</p>

moſt impudently preſume to come to the church and pray; or at leaſt, when they are laide in their beds a nights, and halfe aſleepe, then wil they tumble ouer their praiers, or be pattering ſome Pater noſters.</p>

And therefore God doth both abhorre them, and their prayers. For ſaith he; <hi>Though they ſtretch out their hands, yet will I<note place="margin">Eſa. 1. 15.</note> hide mine eyes from them; and though they make many prayers, yet will I not heare them.

Where <hi>Salomon</hi> ſheweth, that if a flie get into the Apothecaries box of ointment, and die, and putrifie in it, ſhe marreth it, though it be neuer ſo pretious. Euen ſo, if a little ſinne get into the heart, and breake out into the forhead of a man of great fame for ſome ſingular gifts, it will blurre him, though he be neuer ſo excellent.</p>

               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Wée obſerue this, in all experience: that if a Noble man be a good man, and haue many excellent parts in him of courteſie, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, humility, and loue of Religion: yet if hée be couetous, the common people will haue their eye altogether vpon that: and they will ſay; Such a Noble man, is a very good man, but for one thing: hée is excéeding couetous, oppreſſeth poore men, &amp; dealeth hardly with his tenants, kéepeth no houſe, doth little good in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where he dwelleth. And this is it that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let a Judge, a Juſtice, or a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, bée endued with excellent gifts of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, policie, temperance, liberality, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the law: yet, if they be giuen to anger, or taking of bribes, oh, how it will grieue them amongſt the people! For they will ſay: Hée is a worthy man indéed, but there is one thing in him that marreth all: he is an exceding angry and furious man; he is as angry as a waſpe: he
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:13922:108"/>
will be in a pelting chafe for euery trifle: hée will fret and fume, if you doe but blow vpon hun. And beſides this, he is a very corrupt man: hée is a great taker of bribes, hée loueth well to bée bribed: hée will doe any thing for bribes.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if any Preacher be a man of great gifts, the common people will ſay of him: Oh, hée is a worthy man indéed, an excellent Scholar, a profound Diuine, a ſingular man in a Pulpit: but yet, for all that, hée hath a ſhrewd touch which marreth all; he is an excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding proud man: hée is as proud as <hi>Lucifer.</hi> He hath very great gifts indéed, but I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you hée knoweth it well enough. For hée carrieth his creſt very high, and looketh very ſternely, and diſdainefully vpon all other men. Hée is vnmeaſurably puft vp with ouerwée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and thinketh that he toucheth the clouds with his head. Thus therefore we ſée, how the dead flies marre all: and how ſome one ſinne doth diſgrace a man, that otherwiſe doth excell.</p>

men to behold and looke vpon. And ſure it is, they haue a thouſand eies vpon them euery day; and that not onely gazing vpon them, but alſo prying very narrowly into them, to ſpie out the leaſt moat, that they may make a mountaine of it. For, as in a cleane white pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, one little ſpot is ſoone eſpied; but in a péece of browne paper, twenty great blurs are ſcant diſcerned: euen ſo in Noble men, Judges, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Juſtices, Preachers, and Profeſſors, the leaſt ſpot or ſpecke is ſoone ſeene into; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the baſer ſort, and moſt groſſe liuers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nothing is eſpied or regarded.</p>

               <p>Sith the eies of all men are bent and fixed vpon ſuch men as are of ſome note, therefore they had neede verie heedfully to looke to their ſteps, that they may take away all aduantage from them that ſeeke aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>

               <p>I thinke, we may the rather doubt and feare, becauſe the puniſhment of theſe forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vices, is neglected by the Magiſtrate. For commonly, when they that beare the ſword of Iuſtice, doe not draw it out to puniſh notorious offenders and malefactours, the Lord himſelfe will take the matter into his owne hands, and bee reuenged in his owne perſon: which is moſt dreadfull and daungerous.

               <p>You haue ſpoken a truth. For if thoſe, which are Gods deputies and vice-gerents in the earth, doe their duties faithfully in puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing vice, and maintaining vertue; in ſmiting the wicked, and fauouring the godly: then aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly euill ſhall bée taken out of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Gods wrath preuented, and his iudgments intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as it is written: <hi>Phineas</hi> ſtood vp and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted iudgement, and the plague was ſtaied.<note place="margin">1 Pſ. 106. 30</note> But if they (for feare, fauour, affection, gaine,

flattery, bribery, or any other ſiniſter reſpect) will be too ſparing and remiſſe in puniſhing of groſſe offenders, and be rather ready to ſmite the righteous: then doe they excéedingly prouoke Gods wrath againſt the land, and againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>

Now, becauſe they know they cannot, or ſhall not be puniſhed, therefore they are altogether hardned, and imboldned in their ſinnes: as the wiſe man ſaith: <hi>Becauſe ſentence<note place="margin">Eccl. 8. 11.</note> againſt an euill worke is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the hearts of the children of men are fully ſet in them to doe euill.</hi>

               <p>This laſt I take to be a ſpeciall token of approching vengeance; that we haue not profited by former warnings.</p>

               <p>True indéed. For it is an ordinary thing with God, when men will not profit by milde corrections, and common puniſhments, then to lay greater vpon them. And when a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer trouble doth vs no good, we are to feare a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall conſuming trouble. For ſo we reade in the Prophecie of <hi>Hoſea;</hi> that at the firſt, God was to <hi>Ephraim</hi> as a moth, and to <hi>Iudah</hi> as rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but afterward, when as they profited not by it, he was to <hi>Ephraim</hi> as a Lion, and to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 5. 12.</note> as a Lions whelpe. So the Lord ſaith in another place, that, if they will not come in, and yéeld obedience at the firſt call of his wrath, then he will puniſh them ſeuen times more. But if<note place="margin">Leu. 26. 18</note> they continue in their ſtubbornneſſe, then he threatneth to bring ſeuen times more plagues<note place="margin">Verſe 21.</note> vpon them, according to their ſins. If by all theſe they would not be reformed, but walke ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornely<note place="margin">Verſe 24.</note> againſt him, then he threatneth yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen times more, for their ſins: and the fourth<note place="margin">Verſe 28.</note> time, yet ſeuen times more. The proofe héereof wée haue in the booke of the Iudges. Where<note place="margin">Iudg. 3. 8.</note> we read, how the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for their ſins, were in ſubiection to the King of <hi>Aram Naha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim,</hi> eight yéeres: afterward, becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited nothing by it, but returned to their old
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:13922:113"/>
ſinnes, therfore they ſerued <hi>Eglon</hi> king of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab,</hi> eightéene yéeres. After that againe, for their<note place="margin">Iudg. 3.</note> new ſinnes and prouocations, the Lord gaue them vp into the hands of <hi>Midian,</hi> ſeuen yéeres.<note place="margin">Iudg. 6. 1.</note> After all this, for the renewing of their ſins, the Lord ſolde them into the hands of the <hi>Philiſtins</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iud. 10. 7. Pſa. 106. 3.</note> and the <hi>Amonites,</hi> which did gréeuouſly vex and oppreſſe them, for the ſpace of eightéene yéeres. Laſt of all, we reade, that when neither famine nor peſtilence could cauſe them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto him, then he deliuered them vp to the ſword of their enemies, and held them in bondage &amp; captiuity, thréeſcore and ten yéeres. After all this, when they were deliuered out of Captiuity, and returned home ſafely to their owne nation, and inioyed ſome good time of peace and reſt, yet at laſt they fell to renewing of their ſinnes: and therfore the Lord plagued<note place="margin">Ezec. 3. 8.

And this is it, that the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> did foretell: that <hi>the children<note place="margin">Hoſ. 3. 4.</note> of Iſrael ſhould remaine many daies without a King, and without a prince, without an offering, and without an image, without an Ephod, and without Teraphim.</hi>

God at the firſt doth but beat vs vpon the coat: but if we continue in ſinne, he will whip vs on the bare skinne: and if men will not yeeld at the firſt gentle ſtroaks, then he wil ſtrike harder and harder, till he haue broken our ſtout ſtomacks, and made our great hearts come downe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good yeelding at the firſt: for we ſhall get nothing by our ſturdineſſe againſt him.

               <p>The praiers and téeres of the faithfull, are the ſpeciall mean, that ſtay the hand of God from ſtriking of vs. For the praiers of the righteous are of great force with him: euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do all things. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 17.</note> prayer of a righteous man auaileth much, if it be feruent:</hi> and bringeth the example of <hi>Elias,</hi> to proue it: For ſaith he, <hi>Though Elias was a man ſubiect to the like paſſions that we be, yet was he able, by his praiers, both to open and ſhut the heauens. Abraham</hi> likewiſe preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo farre with God, by his praiers for <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> that if there had béene but ten iuſt men
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:13922:114"/>
found in it, it had béene ſpared. The almighty God ſaith in the 15. chap. of <hi>Ieremy, Though<note place="margin">Iere. 15. 1.</note> Moyſes and Samuel ſtood before me, yet mine affection could not bee toward this people.</hi> Which doth plainely ſhew, that <hi>Moyſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> might haue done much with him, had he not béene ſo fully bent againſt his people for their ſins, as he was. So likewiſe he ſaith in the Prophecie of <hi>Ezechiel; Though theſe three<note place="margin">Ez. 14. 14.</note> men, Noah, Daniel and Iob, were amongſt them, they ſhould deliuer but their owne ſoules, by their righteouſneſſe.</hi> Which alſo ſheweth, that if there had béene any poſſible entreating of him for the Land, theſe thrée men might haue done it: but now he was reſolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to the contrary. In reſpect therefore that the zealous preachers, and true profeſſors of the Goſpell doe ſo much preuaile wiſh God by their praiers, they are ſaid to be the defence and ſtrength of Kingdomes and Countries, of Churches and Common wealthes: as it is ſaid of <hi>Eliah;</hi> that he was the Chariot of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. King. 2. 12. 2. King. 6. 17.</note> and the horſmen thereof. <hi>Eliſhah</hi> alſo was enuironed with a mountaine full of horſes, and Chariots of fire. And ſure it is, that <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>Eliſhah</hi> are not onely the Chariots and Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but alſo by their praiers, they do cauſe God himſelfe to be a wal of fire round about it: as the Prophet ſaith in the 22. of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:13922:114"/>
                  <hi>Ezechiel, verſe 30.</hi> the Lord God ſaith: <hi>I<note place="margin">Eze 22. 30</note> ſought for a man among them, that ſhould make vp the hedge, and ſtand in the gappe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me for the land; that I might not deſtroy it: but I found none.</hi> Which ſheweth, that if there had béene but ſome few to haue ſtood in the breach, he would haue ſpared the whole land. This alſo appeareth more plainely, in the Prophecie of <hi>Ieremy;</hi> where the Lord ſaith thus: <hi>Run to and fro, by the ſtreets of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;<note place="margin">Iere. 5. 1.</note> behold and inquire in the open places thereof, if yee can finde a man, or if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that executeth iudgement, and ſeeketh the truth: and I will ſpare it.</hi> Oh then marke and conſider, what a man may doe: yea, what one man may doe: what an <hi>Abraham</hi> may doe: what a <hi>Moyſes</hi> may doe: what an <hi>Eliah</hi> may doe: what a <hi>Daniel,</hi> what a <hi>Samuel,</hi> what a <hi>Iob,</hi> what a <hi>Noah</hi> may doe! Some one man (by reaſon of his high fauor with the Eternal) is able ſometimes to do more for a land, by his praiers and téeres, then many prudent men by their counſell, or valiant men by their ſwords. Yea, it doth euidently appeare (in the ſacred volume of the holy Ghoſt) that ſome one poore Preacher, being full of the Spirit and power of <hi>Eliah,</hi> doth more in his ſtudy (either for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or defence: either for the turning away of wrath, or the procuring of mercie) then a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:13922:115"/>

Some one man doth ſo binde the hands of God, that when he ſhould ſtrike, he hath no power to doe it: as it is ſaid of <hi>Lot: I can doe nothing, till<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 22</note> thou be come out.</hi> Sée how the Lord ſaith, he can doe nothing: becauſe he will doe nothing! Hée doth wittingly and willingly ſuffer his hands to be manacled and bound behind him, for ſome fewes ſake, which he doth make more account of, then all the world beſides: ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and deare are they in his ſight. Likewiſe it is written, that the Lord was excéedingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt the Iſraelites for their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Calfe, which they made in <hi>Horeb:</hi> yet he could doe nothing, becauſe <hi>Moyſes</hi> would not let him. And therefore he falleth to intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> that <hi>Moyſes</hi> would let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and entreat no more for them. Oh, (ſaith<note place="margin">Exo. 32. 10.</note> the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>Moyſes</hi>) <hi>let me alone: that my wrath</hi>

Oh the profoundneſſe and altitude of Gods mercy, towards man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind! Oh, the height and depth, length and breadth of his loue towards ſome!

Let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that are the Lords remembrancers, giue him no reſt, nor let him alone, vntill wée haue ſome ſecurity, and good aſſurance from him, that he will turne away from vs the wrath which we moſt iuſtly haue deſerued: that he wil ſpare vs, and be mercifull vnto vs. Yea, &amp; as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith, <hi>Let vs neuer leaue him, nor giue him<note place="margin">Eſa. 62. 7.</note> ouer, till he repaire and ſet vp Ieruſalem, the praiſe of the world:</hi> leſt for default héereof, that be charged vpon vs, which was charged vpon the head of ſome of the Prophets in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> that they were like the foxes in the waſte pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they had not riſen vp in the gaps, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made vp the hedge for the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               <p>It is written in the Prouerbs of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> that the righteous in a land, are the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of the kings throne; and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, the ouerthrowing of the ſame.

By all theſe teſtimonies it is euident, that princes, kingdomes, cities, towns &amp; villages, are fortified by the righteous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: and for their ſakes alſo great plagues are kept backe. Which thing one of the heathen did well ſée into, as appeareth by his words, which are theſe: <hi>When God meaneth well vnto a city, and will doe good vnto it, then hee raiſeth vp good men: but when hee meaneth to puniſh a citie or countrey, and doe ill vnto it, then he taketh away the good men from it.</hi>

               <p>I doe thinke, if it were not for Gods children, it would goe hard with the wicked.

               <p>Sure it is, all creatures would frowne vpon them. The Sunne would vnwillingly ſhine vpon them: or the Moone giue them any light. The Starres would not be ſeene of them: and the Planets would hide themſelues. The beaſts would deuoure them: the fowles would picke out their eies. The fiſhes would make

               <p>Yet for all this, it is a wonder to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how deadly the wicked hate the righteous, and almoſt in euery thing oppoſe themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: and that in moſt virulent and ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner. They raile and ſlander, ſcoffe and ſcorne, mocke and mowe at them: as though they were not worthy to liue vpon the earth. They eſteeme euery pelting raſcall, and preferre euery vile varlet, before them. And though they haue their liues and liberty, their breath and ſafety, and all that they haue elſe, by them, yet, for all that, they could be content to eat their hearts with garlicke: ſo great, ſo fiery, ſo burning and hiſſing hot is their fury and malice againſt them.</p>

Or vnto a man that ſtandeth vpon a bough in the top of a trée, where there is no more: and yet, with an axe choppeth it off, and therewithall falleth downe with it, and breaketh his necke.

               <p>Now to apply theſe things to our ſelues, and to returne to the firſt queſtion of this argument: may we not maruell, that our nation is ſo long ſpared; conſidering that the ſins there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are ſo horrible and outragious as they be?</p>

               <p>The beſt and ſureſt courſe, that I can conſider or conceiue of, is, to repent heartily for ſinnes paſt, and to reforme our liues in time to come, to ſeeke the Lord while he may be found, and to call vpon him while he is néere: to forſake our owne waies, and our owne ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and to turne vnto him with all our hearts, with wéeping, with faſting, and with mourning; as the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> aduiſeth: <hi>For<note place="margin">Ioel. 2.</note> our God is gracious and mercifull, ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and of great kindeneſſe, and repenteth him of the euill.</hi> All the Prophets doe counſell vs to follow this courſe, and doe plainely teach, that if we all (from the higheſt to the loweſt) doe méet the Lord with vnfained repentance, and offer him the ſacrifice of a contrite ſpirit, vndoubtedly hée will be pacified towards vs, and be mercifull to our tranſgreſſions.

                  <hi>If you amend and redreſſe your waies and your workes: If you execute iudgement betwixt a man and his neighbour, and oppreſſe not</hi>

                  <hi>the ſtranger, the fatherleſſe and the widow, and ſhead no innocent blood in this place, neither walke after other gods, to your deſtruction: then will I let you dwell in this place; euen in the land which I gaue vnto your fathers, for euer and euer.</hi> So likewiſe he ſaith by the ſame Prophet. <hi>Execute yee iudgement and<note place="margin">Ier. 22 3.</note> righteouſneſſe, and deliuer the oppreſſed from the hand of the oppreſſor, and vex not the fatherleſſe, the widow or the ſtrangers; doe no violence, nor ſhead innocent blood in this place.

Iere. 8. 8.</hi> Thus we doe plainely ſée, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and counſell the Prophets and holy men of God doe giue vnto vs. The ſumme of all is this; that if we do truely repent and turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him with all our hearts (ſtudying to obey him, and walke in his waies) then he wil grant vs any fauor, that we wil require at his hands.

Then ſhould we ſtil enioy our liues, our goods, our lands, our liuings, cur wiues, our children, our houſes, and tenements, our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, and Gardens: yea, as the Prophet ſaith, we ſhould eat the good things of the land, ſpending our daies in much comfort, peace and tranquillity: and leaue great bliſſings vnto our children and poſterity, from age to age, from generation to generation.</p>

               <p>You haue fully anſwered my queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and well ſatisfied me therin, out of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: yet I pray you giue me leaue to adde one thing vnto that, which you haue at large ſet downe. The Lord ſaith by the Prophet Amos, that for their ſinnes and rebellions, hee had giuen them cleanneſſe of teeth: that is, dearth and ſcarcitie: and yet they did not turne vnto him. Alſo hee with-held the raine from them, and puniſhed them with drought, and yet they did not turne vnto him. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer hee ſmote their Corne, their great Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, their Orchards, Vineyardes, Figtrees, and Oliue-trees, with blaſting and mildeaw, and the Palmer-worme did deuoure them; and yet they did not returne vnto him. Laſt of all, hee ſmote them with peſtilence, and with the ſword, and ouerthrew them, as he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw Sodome and Gomorrah, and they
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:13922:123"/>
were as a fire-brand pluckt out of the burning: yet, for all this, they did not turne vnto him. Yee haue not turned vnto mee, ſaith the Lord. But now to come to the point. Out of this I<note place="margin">Amos. 4. 6. 7.</note> gather, that if wee multiply our tranſgreſſions, God will multiply his plagues vpon vs: but on the contrary, if wee would vnfainedly turne vnto the Lord our God with all our hearts, all plagues ſhould bee ſtaied, all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers preuented; and no euill ſhould fall vpon vs. For becauſe they would not turne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſmote them. If therefore they had turned, hee would not haue ſmote them. But now I pray you briefely conclude this point, and declare in few words, what it is that doth moſt materially concerne our peace, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>We know that if<note place="margin">2.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:13922:126"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> doth aſſure it alſo to all the children of God. For they all haue the ſame ſpirit: though not in the ſame meaſure. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith alſo:<note place="margin">1. Ioh 2. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Hereby we are ſure we know him; If we keepe his Commandements.</hi> In-which words, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth vs thus much: that if we doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feinedly endeuour to obey God, there is in vs the true knowledge and feare of God: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, wée are ſure we ſhall be ſaued. S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith: <hi>Giue all diligence, to make your<note place="margin">2.

In the ſecond to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith flatly, that in Chriſt Ieſus we doe already ſit together in the heauenly places. His meaning is not, that we are there already in poſſeſſion: but we are as ſure of it, as if we were there already. The reaſons hereof are theſe: Chriſt our head is in<note place="margin">Ioh. 22. 32. Ioh. 14. 13</note> poſſeſſion: Therefore he will draw al his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers vnto him, as he himſelfe ſaith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are as ſure of the thing which we hope for, as of that which we haue. But we are ſure of that which we haue; which is the worke of grace; Therefore we are ſure of that wée looke for; which is the crowne of glory. Many other places of the holy Scriptures might be alleadged to this purpoſe: but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, theſe may ſuffice.</p>

               <p>How can a man in truth call God his Father? (when he ſaith: <hi>Our Father wich art in Heauen</hi>) and yet doubt, whether he be his Father or no? For if God indeed be our Father, and we his children, how can we periſh? how can we be damned? will a father condemne his owne children? or ſhall the children of <hi>God</hi> be condemned?

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, how can a man ſay, in truth and féeling, that he beléeueth the forgiueneſſe of ſin, and yet doubt whether he ſhall be ſaued?

               <p>Nay: we muſt goe further then hope well. We may not venture our ſaluation vpon vncertaine hopes. As, if a man ſhould hope it would be a faire day to morrow: but hée can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainely tell. No, no. We muſt in this caſe, being of ſuch infinite importance as it is, grow to ſome certainety, and full reſolution. Wée ſée, worldly men will be loath to hold their lands and leaſes vncertainely, hauing nothing to ſhew for them. They will not ſtand to the courteſie of their land-lords, nor reſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their good willes. They will not ſtay vpon vncertaine hope. No; they are wiſer then ſo. For the children of this world are wiſer in their generation, then the children of light. They will be ſure to haue ſomething to ſhew. They will haue it vnder ſeale. They will not ſtay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words and promiſes of the moſt honeſt<note place="margin">Luke. 16.</note> men, and beſt Land-lords. They cannot bée quiet, till they haue it in white and blacke, with ſound counſell vpon their Title; and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way made as ſure vnto them, as any Law of the Land can make it.</p>
               <p>Are then the children of this world ſo wiſe in theſe inferiour things, and ſhall not wée bée as wiſe in matters of tenne thouſand times more importance? Are they ſo wiſe for earth, and ſhall not wée bée as wiſe for Heauen? Are they

ſo wiſe for their bodies, and ſhall not we be as wiſe for our ſoules?

               <p>Yes, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth vs, we may bée certaine. For he ſaith: <hi>Heereby we know wee<note place="margin">1.

For he that hath the ſpirit of God, knoweth certainly he hath it; and he that hath faith, knoweth that he hath faith; &amp; he that ſhall be ſaued, knoweth hée ſhall be ſaued. For God doth not worke ſo darkely in mens hearts, by his ſpirit, but that they may eaſily know whether it be of him or no, if they would make a due triall. Againe, the ſame Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>He that beleeueth in the Sonne of God,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 5. 10.</note> hath the witnes in himſelfe.</hi> That is, he hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine teſtimonies in his owne conſcience, that he ſhall be ſaued. <hi>For</hi> we muſt fetch the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of our ſaluation from within our ſelues: euen from the worke of God within vs. For looke, how much a man feeleth in himſelfe the increaſe of knowledge, obedience, &amp; godlines;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:13922:128"/>
ſo much the more ſure hée is, that he ſhall bée ſaued. A mans owne conſcience is of great force this way: and will not lie, or deceiue. For ſo ſaith the wiſe man: <hi>As water ſheweth face to<note place="margin">Pro. 27. 19.</note> face, ſo doth the heart, man vnto man;</hi> That is, the mind and conſcience of euery man telleth him iuſtly (though not perfectly) what he is.

               <p>The Apoſtle alſo ſaith; <hi>No man knoweth the<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 11. Pro. 20. 27.</note> things of man, but the ſpirit of a man that is in him.</hi> And againe, the Scripture ſaith; <hi>Mans ſoule is, as it were, the candle of the Lord: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſearcheth all the bowels of the belly.</hi> So then it is a cleare caſe, that a man muſt haue recourſe to the worke of Gods grace within him, euen in his owne ſoule. For thereby he ſhall be certainely reſolued, one way or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For euen as <hi>Rebecca</hi> knew certainely, by the ſtriuing and ſtirring of the twinnes in her wombe, that ſhe was conceiued and quicke of child; ſo Gods children know certainly, by the motions and ſtirring of the holy Ghoſt within them, that they haue conceiued Chriſt, and ſhall vndoubtedly be ſaued.</p>

               <p>The ground-worke of our ſaluation is laide in Gods eternall election, and in reſpect thereof it ſtandeth faſt and vnmoueable; as it is written: <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth faſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 19. 1. Theſ. 5. 2. Tim. 2. 13.</note> And againe: <hi>He is faithfull, that hath promiſed: though we cannot beleeue, yet he abideth faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi> So then, as we know it certainely in our ſelues, by the conſequents of election; ſo it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth moſt firme in reſpect of God, and his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and immutable decrée. And a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities (nay all the ſinnes in the world, nor all the diuels in hell) cannot ouerthrow Gods election. For our Lord Jeſus ſaith; <hi>All that the<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 37.</note> Father hath giuen me, ſhall come vnto me.</hi> And againe: <hi>This is the Fathers will that hath<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 39.</note> ſent me: that of all which he hath giuen me, I ſhould loſe nothing: but ſhould raiſe it vp againe, at the laſt day.</hi> And in another place,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 27.</note> our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith; <hi>My ſheepe heare my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I giue vnto them eternall life, and they ſhall neuer periſh: neither ſhall any plucke them out of my hand. My Father which gaue them me, is greater then all; and none is able to take them out of my Fathers hand.</hi> Wée ought therefore to be as ſure of our ſaluation, as of any other thing which God hath promiſed, or which we are bound to beléeue. For to doubt thereof, in reſpect of Gods truth, is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

againſt the immutability of his truth.</p>

               <p>But, are there not ſome doubts, at ſome times, euen in the very Elect, and in thoſe which are growen to the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Yes verily. For he that neuer doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neuer beléeued. For whoſoeuer beléeueth in truth, féeleth ſometimes doubtings and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerings. Euen as the ſound body féeleth many grudgings of diſeaſes, which if hée hath not health, hée could not féele: ſo the ſound ſoule féeleth ſome doubtings: which if it were not ſound, it could not ſo eaſily féele. For wée féele not corruption, by corruption; but we féele cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, by grace. And the more grace we haue, the more quicke are we in the féeling of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some men of tender ſkinnes, and quicke féeling, will eaſily féele the lighteſt feather, in ſofter manner laide vpon the ball of their hands; which others, of more ſlow féeling and hard fleſh, cannot ſo eaſily diſcerne. So then it is certaine, that although the children of God féele ſome doubtings, at ſometimes; yet the ſame doe no whit impeach the certainety of their ſaluation: but rather argue a perfect ſoundneſſe and health of their ſoules. For, when ſuch litle grudgings are felt in the ſoule, the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God oppoſe againſt them the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of Gods truth and promiſes: and ſo doe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:13922:129"/>
eaſily ouercome them. For the Lords people néed no more to feare them, then he that rideth thorow the ſtréets vpon a luſty gelding with his ſword by his ſide, néeds to feare the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and bawling of a few little curres and whappets.</p>

               <p>Euen as a man, ſet in the top of the higheſt ſtéeple in the world, and ſo faſt bound vnto it, that he cannot fall though he would; yet when hée looketh downeward, hee feareth, becauſe mans nature is not acquainted, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to mount ſo high in the aire, and to behold the earth ſo farre beneath: but when he looketh vpward, and perceiueth himſelfe faſt bound, and out of all danger, then hée caſteth away all feare.

               <p>They ſpring from the imperfection of our regeneration, and from that ſtrife which
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:13922:130"/>
is in the very minde of the elect, betwéene faith and infidelity. For theſe two do mightily fight together in the moſt regenerate, and ſtriue to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer maſter, and ouerſhadow one another. By reaſon wherof, ſometimes it commeth to paſſe, through the preuailing of vnbeliefe, that the moſt excellent ſeruants of God may fal into fits and pangs of deſpaire, as <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> in their temptations did. And euen in theſe daies alſo, ſome of Gods children at ſometimes are ſhrewdly handled this way, and brought very lowe; euen vnto deaths doore: but yet the Lord in great mercie doth recouer them, both from totall and finall deſpaire. Onely they are humbled and tried by theſe ſharpe fits, for a time, and that for their great good. For as we vſe to ſay, that an Ague in a young man is a ſigne of health: ſo theſe burning fits of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in the elect, for the moſt part, are ſignes of Gods grace and fauor. For, if they were not of God, the diuell would neuer be ſo buſie with them.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Nothing leſſe. For the ground of this perſwaſion is not laid in our ſelues, or any thing within vs, or without vs; but onely in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and the mercifull

promiſes of God. For, is it any preſumption for vs to beléeue that, which God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Chriſt hath purchaſed, and the holy Ghoſt hath ſealed? No verily, it is not any preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but a thing which we all ſtand bound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as we will anſwere it at the dreadfull day of iudgement. As for our ſelues, we do fréely confeſſe, that in Gods ſight we are but lumps of ſinne and maſſes of all miſery; and cannot of our ſelues mooue hand or foot to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our ſaluation.

               <speaker>Theo.</speaker>
               <p>No. For the Prophet ſaith: <hi>There is<note place="margin">Eſay. 57. 22.</note> no peace to the wicked.</hi> Then I reaſon thus: They which haue not the inward peace, cannot be aſſured. But the wicked haue not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace. Therefore they cannot be aſſured. Stedfaſt faith in the promiſes doth aſſure. But the wicked haue not ſtedfaſt faith in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Therefore they cannot be aſſured. The ſpirit of adoption doth aſſure. But the wicked haue not the ſpirit of adoption. Therefore they cannot be aſſured.</p>
               <p>To conclude, when a man féeleth in himſelfe an euill conſcience, blindneſſe, prophaneneſſe,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:13922:131"/>
and diſobedience, he ſhal (in deſpite of his hart) ſing this dolefull ſong: I know not whether I ſhall be ſaued or damned.</p>

               <p>Is not the doctrine of the aſſurance of ſaluation, a moſt comfortable doctrine?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Yes doubtleſſe. For except a man bée perſwaded of the fauour of God, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes, and conſequently of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, what comfort can he haue in any thing? Beſides this, the perſwaſion of Gods loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, is the root of all our loue and cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience towards him. For therefore wée loue him and obey him, becauſe we know hée hath loued vs firſt, and written our names in the booke of life. But on the contrarie, the Doctrine of the Papiſts, which would haue men alwaies doubt and feare in a ſeruile ſort, is moſt helliſh and vncomfortable. For ſo long as a man holds that, what encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can he haue to ſerue God? What loue to his Maieſtie? What hope in the promiſes? What comfort in trouble? What patience in aduerſity?</p>

               <p>Touching this point, I am flat of your minde. For I thinke verily, a man ought to bee perſwaded of his ſaluation. And for mine owne part, I make no queſtion of it. I hope to bee ſaued, as well as the beſt of them all. I am out of feare for that. For I haue ſuch

a ſtedfaſt faith in God, that, if there ſhould be but two in the world ſaued, I hope I ſhould be one of them.</p>

               <p>You are very confident indéed. You are perſwaded before you know. I would your ground were as good, as your vaine confidence. But who is ſo bold as blinde Bayard? Your hope is but a fancie, and as a ſick mans dreame. You hope you can not tell what. You haue no ground for that you ſay. For, what hope can you haue to be ſaued, when you walke in no path of ſaluation? What hope can a man haue to come to <hi>London</hi> ſpéedily, that trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth nothing that way, but quite contrary? What hope can a man haue to reape a good crop of corne, that vſeth no meanes, neither plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſoweth, nor harroweth? What hope can a man haue to be fat and well liking of his body, that ſeldome or neuer eateth any meat? What hope can a man haue to eſcape drowning, which leapeth into the Sea? Euen ſo, what hope can you haue to be ſaued, when you walke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that way, when you vſe no meanes, when you doe all things that are contrary vnto the ſame? For, alas, there is nothing in you of thoſe things, which the Scriptures doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme muſt bée, in all thoſe that ſhall be ſaued. There be none of the fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> named ſignes and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens in you. You are ignorant, prophane and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:13922:132"/>
careleſſe. God is not worſhipped vnder your roofe. There is no true feare of God in your ſelfe nor in your houſhold. You ſeldome heare the word preached. You content your ſelfe with an ignorant Miniſter. You haue no praiers in your family, no reading, no ſinging of pſalmes, no inſtructions, exhortations, or admonitions, or any other Chriſtian exerciſes. You make no conſcience of the obſeruation of the Sabbaths; you vſe not the name of God with any reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; you breake out ſometimes into horrible dathes and curſings; you make an ordinary matter of ſwearing by your faith, &amp; your troth. Your wife is irreligious, your children diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and vngratious, your ſeruants prophane &amp; careleſſe. You are an example in your owne houſe of al Atheiſme, and conſcienceles behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. You are a great gameſter, a rioter, a ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift, a drinker, a common ale-houſe-haunter, an whoore hunter; and, to conclude, giuen to all vice and naughtineſſe. Now then, I pray you tell me, or rather let your conſcience tell mée, what hope you can haue to be ſaued, ſo long as you walk and continue in this courſe? Doth not S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaie; <hi>If wee ſay wee haue fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip<note place="margin">1.

               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:13922:132"/>Againe doth he not ſay: <hi>Heth at committeth<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 8. 10.</note> ſin, is of the Diuell;</hi> And <hi>whoſoeuer doth not righteouſneſſe, is not of God?</hi> Doth not our Lord Jeſus flatly tell the Jewes (which brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that <hi>Abraham</hi> was their father) that they were of their father the diuell: becauſe they did his works? Doth not the Apoſtle <hi>Paul ſay; His<note place="margin">Rom 6. 16.</note> ſeruants we are, to whom we obey; whether it be of ſin, vnto death, or of obedience, vnto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes?</hi> Doth not the ſcripture ſay; <hi>Hee that<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 7.</note> doth righteouſneſſe, is righteous?</hi> Doth not our Lord Jeſus affirme: <hi>that nor euery one that<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 21.</note> ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdome of heauen; but he that doth the will of my father which is in Heauen?</hi> Therefore I conclude: that, foraſmuch as your whole courſe is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, careleſſe, and diſſolute, you can haue no warrantable hope to be ſaued.</p>

to be ſaued by Ieſus Chriſt as well as the beſt of you all.</p>

               <p>Oh, now I ſée which way the game goeth. You would faine make Chriſt a cloake for your ſinnes. You will ſinne, that grace may abound. You will ſinne frankly, and ſet all vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſts ſcore. Truely there be many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of your minde, which, hearing of Gods abundant mercie in Chriſt, are thereby made more bold to ſin. But they ſhall know one day, to their coſt, what it is ſo to abuſe the mercie of God. The Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>The mercy and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> kindneſſe of God ſhould leade vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> But we ſée, it leadeth manie to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hardneſſe of heart. The Prophet ſaith: <hi>With him is mercy, that hee may bee feared.</hi> But many thereby are made more ſecure and careleſſe. But to come néerer the marke: you ſay, you hope to be ſaued by Jeſus Chriſt. And I anſwer: that if thoſe things be found in you, which the Scriptures do auouch to be in all that ſhall be ſaued by him, then you may haue good<note place="margin">9. Things required of all that ſhall be ſaued by Chriſt. 2. Cor. 5. 17. 1. Pet. 4. 2.</note> confidence, and aſſured hope: otherwiſe not. Now the Scriptures do thus determine it, and ſet it downe: That if a man bée in Chriſt, and looke to be ſaued by him, he muſt be indued with theſe qualities following:
<list>
                     <item>Firſt he muſt be a new creature.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, hee muſt liue, not after the luſts of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:13922:133"/>
men: but after the will of God.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, he muſt be zealous of good works.<note place="margin">Tit 2. 14. Rom. 6. 14.</note>
                     </item>
                     <item>Fourthly, hee muſt die to ſinne, and liue to righteouſneſſe.</item>
                     <item>Fiftly, he muſt be holy and vnblameable.</item>
                     <item>Sixtly, he muſt ſo walke, as Chriſt hath walked.<note place="margin">Col. 1. 22. Iohn 2. 6. Gal. 5. 24.</note>
                     </item>
                     <item>Seuenthly, hee muſt crucifie the fleſh, with the affections and luſts.</item>
                     <item>Eigthly, he muſt walke, not after the fleſh, but<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> after the ſpirit.</item>
                     <item>Laſt of all, he muſt ſerue God in righteouſneſſe<note place="margin">Luke. 1. 75.</note> and true holineſſe, all the daies of his life.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Loe then what things are required of all that ſhalbe ſaued by Chriſt. Now therefore, if theſe things be in you in ſome meaſure of tenth, then your hope is currant, ſound, &amp; good: otherwiſe, it is nothing worth. For in vaine doe men ſay, they hope to be ſaued by Chriſt, when as they walke diſſolutely. The reaſon hereof is: becauſe the members muſt be ſutable to the head. But Chriſt our head is holy: therfore we his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers muſt be holy alſo; as it is written: <hi>Be ye<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 16.</note> holy, for I am holy.</hi> Otherwiſe, if we will ioine prophane &amp; vnholy members to our holy head Chriſt, then we make Chriſt a monſter. As if a man ſhould ioyne vnto the head of a Lion, the necke of a Beare, the body of a Wolfe, and the legges of a Foxe: were it not a monſtrous thing: would it not make a monſtrous creature?
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:13922:134"/>
Euen ſuch a thing doe they goe about, which would haue Swearers, Drunkards, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, and ſuch like, to be the members of Chriſt, and to haue life and ſaluation by him. But ſith you doe ſo much preſume of Chriſt, I pray you let mée aſke you a queſtion.</p>

               <p>Anſwer directly to my queſtion. How doe you know in your ſelfe, and for your ſelfe, that you are one of the Elect, and one of thoſe, for whom Chriſt died?</p>

               <p>I know it, by my good faith in God: becauſe I put my whole truſt in him, and in none other.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>But, how know you, that you haue faith? or how ſhall a man know his faith?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Antile.</speaker>
               <p>I know it by this; that I haue alwaies had as good a meaning, and as good a faith to Godward as any man of my calling, and that is
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:13922:134"/>
not booke-learned. I haue alwaies feared God with all my heart, and ſerued him with my prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>

               <p>Tuſh: now you goe about the buſh, and houer in the aire. Anſwer me to the point. How doe you know certainely and aſſuredly, that Chriſt died for you particularly &amp; by name.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Antil.</speaker>
               <p>You would make a man mad. You put me out of my faith: you driue mee from Chriſt. But if you go about to driue mee from Chriſt, I will neuer beleeue you. For I know wee muſt be ſaued onely by him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theo.</speaker>
               <p>I go not about to driue you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, but to driue you to Chriſt. For how can I driue you from Chriſt, ſeeing you neuer came néere him? How can I driue you out of Chriſt, ſéeing you were neuer in him? But this is it, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth you, &amp; many others; that you think you beléeue in Chriſt, becauſe you ſay you beléeue in Chriſt. As though faith conſiſted in words: or, as though a man had faith, becauſe he ſaith ſo, If euery one that ſaith he hath faith, therefore hath faith: &amp; euery one that ſaith he beléeueth in Chriſt, doth therefore beléeue: then who wil not haue faith? who will not beléeue? But in very déed, your faith, and the faith of many others, is nothing elſe but a méere imagination. But all this while, you haue not anſwered my queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, touching your particular knowledge of Chriſt.</p>

               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>No, no; you faulter in your ſpéech: your anſwer is not worth a button, you ſpeake you wot not what, you are altogether befogd and benighted in this queſtion. But, if there were in your heart the true knowledge, &amp; liuely féeling of God, then I am ſure you would haue yéelded another, and a better anſwer. Then you would haue ſpoken ſomething from the ſenſe and féeling of your owne heart &amp; from the worke of Gods grace within you: but becauſe you can yéeld no ſound reaſon, that Chriſt died for you particularly, and by name; therefore I ſuſpect you are none of them which haue proper intereſt in him, and in whom his death taketh effect indéed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>It is moſt certaine. I doe know it by lamentable experience, that not one of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred can ſoundly and ſufficiently anſwer this queſtion: none, indéed, but only thoſe, in whom the new worke is wrought, &amp; do by the inward worke of the ſpirit féele Chriſt to be theirs. I haue talked with ſome, which are both witty, ſenſible, and learned: who notwithſtanding
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:13922:135"/>
when they haue been broght to this very point and iſſue, haue ſtucke ſore at it, &amp; ſtaggred very much. And howſoeuer they might by wit and learning ſhuffle it ouer, and in a plundred ſort, ſpeake reaſon: yet had they no feeling of that which they ſaid, and therfore no aſſurance: and conſequently as good neuer a whit, as neuer the better. It is the ſanctifying ſpirit, that giueth féeling in this point. And therefore, without the féeling of the operation of the ſame ſpirit, it can neuer be ſoundly anſwered. Thus then, I doe cloſe vp this whole matter: As the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brauch cannot liue and bring forth fruit, except it abide in the Ume: no more can wée, except we abide in Chriſt, and be truely grafted into him by a liuely faith. None can haue any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by him, but they only which dwel in him. None can liue by Chriſt, but they which are changed into Chriſt. None are partakers of his body, but they which are in his body. None can be ſaued by Chriſt crucified, but they which are crucified with Chriſt. None can liue with him béeing dead, but thoſe which die with him bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aliue. Therefore let vs root down-ward in mortification, that we may ſhoot vpward in ſanctification. Let vs die to ſinne, that we may liue to righteouſneſſe: Let vs die while we are aliue, that we may liue when we are dead.</p>

For many (I ſay vnto you)<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 14.</note> will ſeeke to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> In which anſwer, albeit our Sauiour doth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer directly to his queſtion, either negatiuely or affirmatiuely; yet doth he plainely inſinuate by his ſpéeches, that few ſhall bee ſaued. For firſt he bids vs ſtriue earneſtly: noting therby,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:13922:136"/>
that it is a matter of great ſtrife againſt the world, the fleſh, and the diuell. Secondly, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that the gate is very ſtraight: noting, that none can enter in, without veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and almoſt breaking their ſhoulder bones. Laſtly, he ſaith; that many which ſéeke to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, ſhall not be able: noting thereby, that euen of them that ſéeke, many ſhall ſtep ſhort; becauſe they ſeeke him not aright. <hi>Eſaias</hi> alſo ſaith: <hi>Except the Lord of Hoſts had left vs a<note place="margin">Eſay. 1. 9.</note> ſeed, we had beene as <hi>Sodome, <hi>and had beene like to</hi> omorrha.</hi>

               <p>If we come to reaſon, wée may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wonder that any ſhould bée ſaued, then ſo few ſhall be ſaued. For, wée haue all the lets and hindrances that may bée, both within vs and without vs. Wée haue (as they ſay) the Sunne, Moone, and ſeuen Starres againſt vs. Wée haue all the Diuels in Hell againſt vs, with all their hornes, heads, maruellous ſtrength, infinite wiles, cunning deuices, déepe ſleights, and methodicall temptations. Héere runnes a ſore ſtreame againſt vs. Then haue
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:13922:137"/>
wée this preſent euill world againſt vs, with her innumerable baits, ſnares, nets, gins, and grins to catch vs, fetter vs, and entangle vs. Héere haue wée profits and pleaſures, riches and honour, wealth and preferment, ambition and couetouſneſſe. Héere comes in a Campe royall of ſpirituall and inuiſible enemies. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wée haue our fleſh, that is, our corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt vs: wée haue our ſelues againſt our ſelues. For we our ſelues are as great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to our ſaluation, as either the world, or the Diuell. For, our vnderſtanding, reaſon, will, and affections, are altogether againſt vs. Our naturall wiſedome is an enemy vnto vs. Our concupiſences &amp; luſts do miniſter ſtrength to ſathans temptations. They are all in league with Sathan againſt vs. They take part with him in euery thing againſt vs and our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They fight all vnder his ſtandard, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their pay of him. This then goeth hard on our ſide, that the Diuell hath an inward party againſt vs: and wée carry alwaies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs our greateſt enemy, which is euer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, night and day, to betray vs into the hands of Sathan; yea to vnbelt the dore, and let him in to cut our throats.

For who ſeeth not, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that thouſand thouſands are caried headlong to deſtruction; either with the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the world, the fleſh or the Diuell? But yet further, I will ſhew, by an other verie manifeſt and apparant reaſon, that the number of Gods Elect vpon the face of the earth, are very few in compariſon: which may thus bée conſidered. Firſt, let there bée taken away from amongſt vs all Papiſts, Atheiſts, and Heretikes. Secondly, let there bée ſhoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out all vicious and notorious euill liuers; as Swearers, Drunkards, Whooremongers, Worldlings, deceiuers, couſeners, proud men, Rioters, gameſters, and all the prophane mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. Thirdly, let there be refuſed and ſorted out all Hypocrites, carnall Proteſtants, vaine profeſſors, backeſliders, decliners, and colde Chriſtians. Let all theſe, I ſay, bée ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated: and then tell mée, how many ſound, ſincere, faithfull, and zealous worſhippers of God, will bée found among vs. I ſuppoſe, wée ſhould not néed the Arte of Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike to number them.

thinly in the ſtréets: ſo as a man might eaſily tell them as they goe.

               <p>In the firſt age of the world, all fleſh had ſo corrupted their waies, that God could no longer beare them; but euen vowed their deſtruction, by the ouerflowing of waters.

How few righteous were found in <hi>Sodome,</hi> and the Cities adioyning; but one poore <hi>Lot,</hi> and his family? How few beleeuers were found in <hi>Iericho;</hi> but one <hi>Rahab?</hi> How few of the old <hi>Iſraelites</hi> entred into the Land of Promiſe; but two, <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſuah?</hi> The<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 19.</note> reſt could not enter in, becauſe of vnbeliefe.

                  <note place="margin">1. Kin. 17.</note> the ſincere worſhippers were very few: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by all the Prophets. During the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity, the Church was as the Moone voder a

For, though a mans outward actions be religious and honeſt, yet you will condemne him. And, if a man giue himſelfe to the word and praier, reformeth his family, and abſtaineth from the groſſe ſinnes of the world, you will by and by ſay, he is an hypocrite.

               <p>Now you would ſhuffle vp all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as though you were as good as the beſt, and as though there were no difference of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: but you muſt learne to know, that there is great difference of ſinners. For there is the penitent, and the vnpenitent ſinner; the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the careleſſe ſinner; the ſinner whoſe ſinnes are not imputed, and the ſinner whoſe ſinnes are imputed; the ſinner that ſhall bée ſaued, and the ſinner that ſhall bée damned. For it is one thing to ſinne of frailty, another thing to liue in it, dwell in it, and trade in it, and (as the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh) to ſucke it in, as the<note place="margin">Eſay. 5. 18.</note> fiſh ſucketh water, and to draw it vnto vs with cart-ropes and cords of vanity.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore, there is as great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a ſinner, and a ſinner, as betwixt light and darkeneſſe. For, though Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be ſinners, in reſpect of the remnants of ſin within them, yet the Scriptures call them iuſt and righteous: becauſe they are iuſtified by Chriſt, and ſanctified by his grace and holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

draw my loue and liking towards you. And as for ill wil, the Lord knoweth I beare you none. I deſire your conuerſion, and ſaluation, with my whole heart. And I would thinke my ſelfe happie, if I might ſaue your ſoule with the loſſe of my right arme.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Antile.</speaker>
               <p>I hope I may repent. For the ſcripture ſaith: At what time ſoeuer a ſinner doth repent, God will haue mercy on him. Therefore if I may haue ſpace and grace, and time to repent before death, and to aske God forgiueneſſe, and ſay my praiers, and cry God mercie, I hope I ſhall doe well enough.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>You ſpeake as though repentance were in your power, and at your commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that you can put it into your owne heart when you liſt; and that makes you, and many others preſume of it, thrée houres before death. But you muſt know that repentance is the rare gift of God: and it is giuen but to a few. For God will know him well that hée beſtoweth repentance vpon, ſith it is proper onely to the Elect. It is no word matter. It is not attained without many &amp; feruent prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, &amp; much hearing, reading, and meditating in the word of God. It is not ſo eaſie a matter to come by, as the world iudgeth. It is not found but of them that ſeeke it diligently, and begge it earneſtly. It is no ordinarie thrée
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:13922:146"/>
houres matter. Crie God mercie a little for faſhion will not doe it. Courſarie ſaying of a few prayers a little before death auaileth not. For, though true repentance be neuer too late, yet late repentance is ſeldome true. Héerein delayes are dangerous; for the longer we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it, the woorſe is our caſe. The further a naile is driuen in with an hammer, the harder it is to get out againe. The longer a diſeaſe is let runne, the harder it is to cure. The déeper a trée is rooted, the harder it is to plucke vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The longer we deferre the time of our repentance, the harder it will be to repent; and therefore it is dangerous driuing it off to the laſt caſt. For an ancient Father ſayth:<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> 
                  <hi>We reade but of one that repented at the laſt, that no man ſhould preſume: and yet of one, that none might deſpaire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then, to conclude this point, I would haue you to know, that the preſent time is alwayes the time of repentance. For, time paſt can not be recouered, and time to come is vncerteine.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Antile.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, in mine opinion, you haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſome very dangerous things, and ſuch as were enough to driue a man to deſpaire.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Antile.</speaker>
               <p>There be diuers things. But one thing doth moſt of all ſticke in my ſtomacke,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:13922:147"/>
and that is, the ſmall number that ſhall be ſa ued, as you ſay. But I can hardly be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that God made ſo many thouſands to caſt them away when he hath done. Do you thinke that God hath made vs, to condemne vs? Will you make him to be the authour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing leſſe. For God is not the cauſe of mens condemnation, but themſelues. For euery mans deſtruction commeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: as it is written: <hi>O Iſrael, thy deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of thy ſelfe.</hi> As for God, he doth (in great<note place="margin">Hoſ. 13.</note> mercie) vſe all poſſible meanes to ſaue ſoules; as hée ſayth by the Prophet: <hi>What could I<note place="margin">Eſa. 5. 4.</note> haue done more to my vineyard, that I haue not done vnto it?</hi> But to come néerer to your queſtion. I denie, that God hath created the moſt part of men onely and ſolely vnto perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the proper end which he did aime at in creating them: but hée hath created all things for the praiſe of his glorie; as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: <hi>Hee hath created all things for himſelfe;<note place="margin">Pro. 16. 4.</note> and the wicked alſo for the euill day.</hi> Then it followeth, that the cauſe and end why the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked were created, neither was, nor is the onely deſtruction of his creature, but his owne praiſe and glorie; that that onely might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare and ſhine foorth in all his works. Yet certeins it is, that God, for iuſt cauſes (albeit
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:13922:147"/>
vnknowen and hidde to vs) hath reiected a great part of men. The cauſes, I ſay, of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation are hid in the eternall counſell of God, and knowen to his godly wiſdome only. They are ſecret and hid from vs; reſerued in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall wiſdome to be reuealed at the glorious appearing of our Lord Jeſus. <hi>His iudgements</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 36. Rom. 11.</note> (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>are as a great deepe, and his wayes paſt finding out.</hi> It is as poſſible for vs to comprehend the Ocean ſea in a little diſh, as to comprehend the reaſon of Gods counſell in this behalfe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Antile.</speaker>
               <p>What reaſon, iuſtice, or equitie is there, that ſentence of death ſhould be paſſed vpon men before they be borne, and before they haue done good or euill?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>I tolde you before, that we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer comprehend the reaſon of Gods procéeding in this behalfe: yet we muſt know that his will is the rule of righteouſneſſe, and muſt be vnto vs in ſtead of a thouſand reaſons. For whatſoeuer God willeth, in as much as hée willeth it, is to be holden iuſt. We cannot conceiue the reaſon of many naturall things, and things ſubiect to ſenſe; as, the motion of the celeſtiall bodies, their vnconceiueable ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, their matter and ſubſtance, their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, altitude, and latitude. We can not thorowly finde out the cauſes of the thunder,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:13922:148"/>
lightning, windes, earth-quakes, ebbing and flowing of the ſea, and many other things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne: how then can we poſſibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend vp into the priuy chamber and counſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of God, to ſift and ſearch out the bottome of Gods ſecrets; which no wit or reach of man can any way attaine vnto! Let vs therefore learne in Gods feare to reuerence that which we can not in this life comprehend.</p>
               <p>This one thing I muſt ſay vnto you, that whatſoeuer God decréeth, yet doth he execute no man, till he haue ten thouſand times deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it. For, betwixt the decrée and the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, commeth ſinne in vs, and moſt iuſt cauſes of condemnation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Antil.</speaker>
               <p>If God haue decreed mens deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what can they do withall? who can reſiſt his will? why then is he angrie with vs? For all things muſt needs come to paſſe according to his decree and determination.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Firſt, I anſwer you with the Apoſtle: <hi>O man, who art thou which pleadeſt againſt<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 20</note> God! Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made mee thus? Hath not the Potter power of the clay, to make of the ſame lumpe one veſſell to honour, and another to diſhonour?</hi> Moreouer, I anſwer, That Gods decrée doth not enforce the will of man: but it worketh, and mooueth of it ſelfe.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:13922:148"/>
It hath in it ſelfe the beginning of euill moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſinneth willingly. Therefore, though the decrée of God impoſeth a neceſſitie vpon all ſecondarie cauſes (ſo as they muſt néeds be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and diſpoſed according to the ſame) yet no coaction or conſtraint: for they are all carried with their voluntarie motion. Euen as we ſée the plumbe of a clocke, being the firſt moouer, doth cauſe all the other whéeles to mooue, but not to mooue this way or that way: for, in that they mooue ſome one way, and ſome another, it is of themſelues; I meane of their owne frame. So Gods decrée doth mooue all ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie cauſes, but not take away their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion. For God is the authour of euerie action, but not of any euill in any action. As the ſoule of man is the originall cauſe of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in man, as the Philoſophers diſpute, but yet not of lame and impotent motion; for that is from another cauſe; to wit, ſome defect in the bodie. So, I ſay, Gods decrée is the root and firſt cauſe of motion, but not of defectiue motion: That is from our ſelues. Likewiſe, that a bell ſoundeth, the cauſe is in him that ringeth it: but that it iarreth, the cauſe is in it ſelfe. Againe, that an inſtrument ſoundeth, is in him that plaieth vpon it: but that it iarreth, is in it ſelfe; that is, in it owne want of tuning. So then, to ſhut vp this point, all inſtruments
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:13922:149"/>
and middle cauſes are ſo mooued of God, being the firſt moouer, that he alwayes doth well, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, and iuſtly in his moouing. But the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments mooued, are caried in contrary motions, according to their owne nature and frame. If they be good, they are caried vnto that which is good: but if they be euill, they are caried vnto euill. So that according to the double begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of motion and will, there is a double and diuers worke and effect.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Antil.</speaker>
               <p>How could his will encline vnto euill, it being made good, and he being made good?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>He and his will were made good, yet mutably good. For to be immutably good, is proper only to God. And <hi>Adam</hi> did ſo ſtand, that he might fall, as the euent declared.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Antile.</speaker>
               <p>Was not the decree of God the cauſe of Adams fall?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>No: but the voluntarie inclination of his will vnto euill. For <hi>Adams</hi> will was neither forced, nor by any violence of Gods
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:13922:149"/>
purpoſe, compelled to conſent: but he, of frée will and ready minde, left God, and ioined with the Diuell.</p>
               <p>Thus then I do determine, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned neceſſarily, if you reſpect the decree or euent: but if you reſpect the firſt moouer and inherent cauſe, which was his owne will, then he ſinned voluntarily and contingently. For the decree of God did not take away his will, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencie thereof; but only order and diſpoſe it. Therefore (as a learned writer ſayth) <hi>Volens</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beza.</note> 
                  <hi>peccauit, &amp; motu. <hi>He ſinned willingly, and of his owne motion. And therefore no euill is to be attributed vnto God or his decree.</hi>

               <p>Touching the decrée of Election, there are almoſt none that make any doubt thereof: therefore ſmall proofe ſhall ſerue for this point. Onely I will confirme it by one or two teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies out of the holy Scriptures. Firſt the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>Bleſſed be God, euen the Father<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 3</note> of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall bleſſings in Heauenly things in Chriſt, as hee hath choſen vs in him, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him, in loue.</hi> You ſée, the words are very plaine and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for this purpoſe. An other confirmation is taken out of the 8. Chap. to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Thoſe whom he knew before, did<note place="margin">Rom 8.</note> he alſo predeſtinate to be like to the image of his own Sonne; that he might be the firſt borne of many brethren.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>Which be the cauſes of Election?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>The cauſes of Election are to be found onely in God himſelfe. For his eternall election dependeth neither vpon man, neither yet vpon any thing that is in man, but is purpoſed in himſelfe, and eſtabliſhed in Chriſt in whom we are Elected. This is fully prooued in theſe words: <hi>Who hath predeſtinated vs to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opted<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 5. 6</note> through Ieſus Chriſt in himſelfe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:13922:151"/>
                  <hi>to the good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe of his glory, wherewith he hath made vs freely accepted in his beloued.</hi> Where wée ſee, the apoſtle telleth vs, that his frée grace, and the good pleaſure of his will, are the firſt motiues or moouing cauſes of our Election.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>But the Papiſts fetch the firſt motiue of election out of mans merits, and fore-ſeene works. For, ſay they, God did fore-ſee who would repent, beleeue, and doe well: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made choiſe of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>But they are greatly deceiued. For I ſay againe, and againe, that there was nothing in vs which did euer mooue God to ſet his loue vpon vs, and to chooſe vs vnto life: but he euer found the originall cauſe in himſelfe. As it is<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> written; <hi>Hee will haue mercy vpon whom he will haue mercy: and whom hee will, hee hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> And againe: <hi>It is neither in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth; but in God that ſheweth mercie.</hi> The Lord himſelfe<note place="margin">Deut. 7. 7.</note> alſo teſtifieth, that hée did chooſe his people, not for any reſpect in them; but onely becauſe hée loued them, and bare a ſpeciall fauour vnto them. So then it is a certaine truth that Gods eternall predeſtination excludeth all merits of man, and all power of his will, thereby to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto eternall life: and that his frée mercy, and vndeſerued fauour, is both the beginning,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:13922:152"/>
the middeſt, and the end of our ſaluation. That is to ſay, all is of him, and nothing of our ſelues.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
               <p>Whether then doth faith depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on election, or election vpon faith? That is, whether did God chooſe vs becauſe we doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue? or whether doe we beleeue, becauſe we are choſen?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Out of all doubt, both faith, and all fruits of faith, doe depend vpon election. For, therefore we beléeue, becauſe we are elected: and not therfore elected, becauſe we beléeue. As it is written: <hi>So many as were ordained to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting<note place="margin">Act. 13. 48.</note> life, beleeued.</hi>

               <p>This is a very wicked and carnall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, and ſheweth a vile and diſſolute minde in them that vſe it. But I would wiſh ſuch men to conſider the end of our election: which is that we ſhould lead a godly life. As it is plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet downe in the firſt to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>God hath choſen vs before<note place="margin">Ephe. 1. 3.</note> the foundation of the world.</hi> But to what end? that we ſhould line as we lift? No, no, ſaith he: <hi>But that we ſhould be holy, and vnblameable before him.</hi> Againe he ſaith: <hi>We are perdeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:13922:152"/>
                  <hi>to bee made like the image of his Sonne;</hi> that is, <hi>to be holy and righteous.</hi> For moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that we can iudge nothing of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, but by the conſequents: that is, by our calling, iuſtification, and ſanctification. For when once we féele the worke of grace within vs, (that is, that we are waſhed by the new birth, and renewed by the holy Ghoſt, finding in our ſelues an vnfained hatred of ſin, and loue of righteouſneſſe) then are we ſure, and out of all doubt, that we are predeſtinated to life. And it is euen as much, as if God had perſonally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto vs, and whiſpered vs in the eare, and told vs that our names are taken, &amp; writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the booke of life. For, <hi>whom he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> them he hath called; and whom he hath called, them he hath iuſtified; &amp; whom he hath iuſtified, them he hath glorified.</hi> Now therefore, till we féele theſe marks of election wrought in vs, we can be at no certainty in this point; neither are we to take any notice of it, or meddle in it: but we muſt ſtriue, according to that power and faculty we haue, to liue honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ciuilly, waiting when God will haue mercy on vs, and giue vs the true touch. As for them that are careleſſe and diſſolute, ſetting all at ſix and ſeuen, there is ſmal hope that they are elected, or euer ſhall be called.</p>

               <p>I thinke the preaching and publiſhing
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:13922:153"/>
of this doctrine of predeſtination hath done much hurt: and it had beene good it had neuer beene knowen to the people, but vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. For, ſome it driueth to deſpaire, and others it maketh more ſecure and careleſſe.</p>

               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>You are in a great errour. For this Doctrine is a part of Gods reuealed Truth, which hée would haue knowen to his people. And, in good ſooth, it is of very great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable vſe to the children of God, againſt all the aſſaults of the Diuell, and temptations of deſperation whatſoeuer. For, when a man hath once in truth felt, by the effects, that God hath choſen him to life: then though the Diuell lie ſore at him, and the conſcience of ſinne and his own frailties moſt vehemently aſſault him; yet he knoweth certainely, that the eternall purpoſe and counſell of God is immutable; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his ſaluation is not grounded vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or his owne ſtrength, but vpon the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable decrée of God, which is a foundation vnmoueable, and alwaies ſtanding ſure and firme; therefore, doe the diuell and ſinne what they can, yet he ſhal be vpheld in righteouſneſſe &amp; truth, &amp; euen (as it were) borne vp in the arms of God, euen to the end. For whom God loueth, to the end he loueth them. Moreouer, when once the Lords people perceiue (by their ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and new birth) both that the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:13922:153"/>
and reprobated ſo many thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and made choiſe of them to be heirs of his moſt glorious kingdome, being in themſelues of the ſame mould and making that others are; and that be hath done all this of his frée grace, and vndeſerued mercy towards them: oh, how doth it rauiſh their hearts with the loue of him! Againe, how frankely and chearefully doe they ſerue him! How willingly and faithfully doe they obey him! Yea, how are they wholy rapt, and infiamed with the deſire of him! For it is the perſwaſion and féeling of Gods loue towards vs, that draweth vp our loue to him againe; as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith: <hi>We loue him, becauſe he hath<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.</note> loued vs firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is ſaide of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke. 7.</note> that ſhée loued much, becauſe much was forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. For, after ſhe felt her many and great ſins fréely pardoned, her affections were kindled with the loue and obedience of Chriſt. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Church in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> after ſhe had béene in the banqueting houſe of all ſpirituall<note place="margin">Cant. 2. 5</note> grace, and felt the banner of Chriſts loue diſplai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon her, forthwith ſhée was rapt therewith, and cried out (as it were in a ſwoune) that ſhée was ſicke of loue. So againe, when Chriſt put<note place="margin">Cant. 5. 4.</note> in his hand by the hole of the doore (that is, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the very inward parts of her heart, by his ſpirit) then her heart yearned, and her bowels
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:13922:154"/>
were affectioned towards him. This is it which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> praieth for vpon his knees, that it may be granted to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.</note> they may be able to comprehend with all the Saints, what is the breadth and length, height and depth of Gods loue towards vs, and to know the loue of Chriſt (which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) and to be filled with all fulneſſe of God. Thus then you ſée the great and comfortable vſe of this doctrine of election, both in that it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth ſtrength &amp; comfort againſt all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as alſo becauſe it conſtraineth vs to loue God &amp; of very loue to feare him, and obey him.</p>

               <p>Well Sir, I thinke now you haue ſpent time enough in anſwering the obiections and cauils of <hi>Antilegon.</hi> In all which, I doe obſerue one thing; that there is no end of cauilling, and obiecting againſt the truth; and that a man may obiect more in an houre, then a learned man can well anſwer in a day.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>You ſay truth. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe men haue ſin in them out of meaſure, and the ſpirit of God but in meaſure. Therefore they can by the one, obiect and conceiue more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, then by the other they ſhall be able to anſwer, and ſay for it.</p>

               <p>It appeareth indeed, that errors be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, &amp; obiections innumerable, &amp; that there is no end of mens cauilling againſt Gods ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

truth. It is good for vs therefore to bee throughly ſetled in the truth, that wee be not entangled or ſnarled with any cauils, or ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtications whatſoeuer. But I doe verily thinke (notwithſtanding all his obiections, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions) that he doth in his conſcience deſire, with <hi>Balaam,</hi> to die the death of the righteous, and to be as one of them, whom he ſeemeth to deſpiſe.</p>

For many will beléeue nothing, but their owne fanſies. They will not beléeue the word of God: eſpecially, when it is contrary to their luſtes and likings, profits &amp; pleaſures. Though things be manifeſtly prooued to their faces, and both the Chapter and the Uerſe ſhewed them, yet will they not beléeue: or though they ſay they beléeue, yet will they neuer goe about the practiſe of any thing, but reply againſt God in all their actions. And, for the moſt part, when God ſaith one thing, they will ſay another. When God ſaith yea, they will ſay no: and ſo giue God the lie.

him, that the ſame night, hée ſhould make a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and miſerable end. Note, I pray you, how Jeſus Chriſt, the fountaine of all Wiſedome, calleth this man a foole; and yéeldeth a reaſon thereof: to wit, becauſe hée gathered riches to himſelfe, and was not rich in God; hee had great care of this life, and none at all for that which is to come.

Alas poore ſoules, they looke aloft: they are deſperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hauen vp with conceiptedneſſe; not knowing that they are poore, naked, blinde, &amp; miſerable.<note place="margin">Reu. 3. 17.</note>

<pb n="310" facs="tcp:13922:160"/>
then is it a wonder to ſée how they ſtreake themſelues; as though they would forthwith take their flight, and mount into the cloudes.

For, they are all but as an ice of one nights fréezing, which will deceiue them that truſt vnto it. Let them therefore become fooles in themſelues,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:13922:160"/>
that God may make them wiſe. Let them deny themſelues, that God may acknowledge them. Let them be humbled in themſelues, that God may exalt them. For aſſuredly, there is no vſe after this life, of the moſt exquiſtte wiſedome of fleſh: it all endeth when we end. For how dieth the wiſe man? Euen as dieth the foole, ſaith the<note place="margin">Eccl. 2. 16.</note> holy Ghoſt. And where all worldly wiſedome endeth, there all heauenly wiſedome beginneth.

all by their example, to take héed, and beware of lewd company. Moreouer, the Scripture ſaith: <hi>He that followeth vaine companions, ſhall be filled with pouerty.</hi> And againe in the<note place="margin">Pro. 28. 19.</note> ſame Chapter, <hi>He that keepeth company with banquetters, ſhameth his Father.</hi> Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with <hi>Dauid</hi> ſay, <hi>I am a companion of all<note place="margin">Pſ. 119. 63.</note> them that feare God, and keepe his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And, on the contrary, let vs ſay with him, <hi>I haue not haunted with vaine perſons,<note place="margin">Pſ. 26. 4</note> neither kept company with the diſſemblers.

It is the ſureſt note to diſcern a man by. For, as al vnlike things are vnſociable, ſo all like things are ſociable. Herein let vs beware, we deceiue not our ſelues with vaine words, and an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our owne ſtrength: as if we were as ſtrong as Chriſt, &amp; could not be drawne away with any company. No, no: we are more apt to be drawne, then to draw: to be drawne to euill by others, then to draw others to good. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſaith by his prophet: <hi>Let them returne vnto thee, but returne not thou vnto them.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly<note place="margin">Iere. 15. 19.</note> he is an odde man, that is not made worſe with ill companie. For can a man touch pitch, and not be defiled therewith? Can a man
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:13922:161"/>
carry coales in his boſome, and not bée burnt? Daily &amp; lamentable experience ſheweth, that many of them, which thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſtrong, are this way moſt gréeuouſly ſmutted. Let a man thinke therefore, hée neuer abandoneth euill, till hée abandon ill company. For no good is concluded in this Parliament. For ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is the ſuburbes of hell. Furthermore, it is to be obſerued, that ſome vpon admonitions, and ſome inward compunctions of their owne conſcience, doe leaue their ſinnes, vntill they haue new prouocations, and vntill they come amongſt their old copeſmates and ſinne-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions: and then are they carried backe againe to their old bias, and returne to their folly, as a<note place="margin">Pro. 26. 11.</note> dog returneth to his vomit. For wee ſée ſome, which otherwiſe are of good natures and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, moſt pittifully, and violently carried away with ill company. For euen as gréene wood of it ſelfe is vnapt to burne, yet being laid on the fire, with a great deale of ſeare wood, it burneth as faſt as the reſt: So, many toward youthes, which of themſelues are not ſo prone vnto euill, as others: yet with this violent ſtreame and bluſtering tempeſt of ill company, are carried cleane away.</p>

And let vs that are the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Preachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, looke narrowly to our ſelues, and make ſtraight ſteps to our féet. For if we tread neuer ſo little awry, we may ſée how many eies are vpon vs. Let vs therfore with <hi>Dauid</hi> pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, <hi>Order my goings, O Lord, that my footſteps ſlip not. For when my foot ſlipped, they reioyced againſt me.</hi> And as for the people, let them follow the examples of thoſe, which walke vnblameably (as God be thanked, ſome ſuch there be) and let them flie the examples of ſuch as are offenſiue. So ſhall God haue more glory, &amp; they more peace in their owne hearts. Thus haue we heard, what a wide gate is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened into hell, by the euill example of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,

               <p>Well, ſith there be ſo many bars out of heauen, and ſo many gates into hell, it is a very hard matter to breake thorow all theſe barres, and ſo to enter into life: and as hard a matter, to miſſe all theſe gates, and to eſcape hell. He quits him well, that can doe it.</p>

               <p>As hard as it is, yet I hope by the grace of God, I ſhall be one of them, that ſhall enter in. For, ſo long as I doe as I would be done to; and ſay no body no harme, nor do no body no harme, God will haue mercy on my ſoule. And I doubt not, but my good deeds ſhall weigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my euill deeds, and that I ſhal make euen with God, at my latter end. For I thanke God for it, I haue alwaies liued in his feare, &amp; ſerued him with a true intent.

               <p>I am as guilty in this, as in any thing. For (God forgiue me) I haue often deſired and luſted after this, and that, which was none of mine owne, and ſo haue bewraied my diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>Then I perceiue (by your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) that you are guilty of the breach of all the Commandements.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Aſune.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt needs confeſſe it. For I ſee now more into that matter, then euer I did. I neuer heard ſo much before in my life, nor was euer asked any ſuch queſtions, as you aske me. I had thought many of thoſe things, which
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:13922:168"/>
you asked me, had beene no ſinnes at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>I could haue conuicted you in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other particulars, wherein you doe daily and hourely breake the Law of God. But my purpoſe was onely to giue you a taſte of ſome particular tranſgreſſions, and there withal ſome little light by the way into the meaning of the law: that thereby you might be brought to ſome better fight of your ſelfe, and might a little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in what caſe you ſtand before God; and by that little, conceiue a great deale more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aſune.</speaker>
               <p>Well: now I doe plainely ſee, that I haue beene deceiued; and am not in ſo good eſtate before God, as I thought I had beene. Moreouer I ſee, that thouſands are out of the way, which thinke they are in a good caſe before God: whereas indeed they are in blindneſſe, and in their ſins. But Lord haue mercy vpon vs. I doe now plainely ſee, that I am farre from kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the commandements: and I thinke no man doth keepe them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>You may ſwear it, I warrant you. For neither S. <hi>Paul, Dauid,</hi> or the virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> could euer kéepe any one of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I am glad you begin to ſée into the law of God, and to haue ſome taſte that way. For, as a mans knowledge and inſight is into the law, ſo is the knowledge and inſight into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He that hath a déepe inſight into the law of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:13922:168"/>
God, hath alſo a déepe inſight into himſelfe. He that hath no ſight into the law, can haue no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into himſelfe. For the law is that glaſſe wherein we do behold the face of our ſoules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. The Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>By the law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20.</note> the knowledge of ſinne.</hi> Therefore thoſe which are altogether ignorant of the law, and neuer behold themſelues in this glaſſe, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an hundred ſinnes a day, which they know not of; and therefore are not gréeued for them. For, how can a man be gréeued for that, which he knoweth not? But now further, I pray you giue me leaue to aſke you ſome moe queſtions of the principles of religion: to the end, that you knowing and féeling your ignorance, may bée humbled therwith, bewaile it in time, &amp; ſéeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the true knowledge of God. But yet, by the way, I will aſke <hi>Antilegon,</hi> a queſtion, or two; becauſe I deſire to vnderſtand what know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he hath in the grounds of religion. Tell me therefore <hi>Antilegon,</hi> what was the reaſon why Chriſt was conceiued by the holy Ghoſt?</p>

               <p>I am ſo perſwaded too. For let a man talke with worldly men of worldly matters, and their anſwer is neuer to ſeeke. They will talke very freſhly with you of ſuch matters, if it be all the day long. For they haue a déepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight

into earthly things: and doe wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to talke of them, being neuer weary. For it is their ioy, their meate, and their drinke. But come once to talke with them of Gods matters (as of faith, repentance regeneration &amp;c.) you ſhall finde them the verieſt dullards, &amp; dunces in the world.

               <p>Queſtionles.

                  <note place="margin">Math. 22.</note> The Apoſtle ſaith, that ignorance doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate vs from the life of God. For ſaith he, <hi>The gentiles were darkened in their cogitation,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 18.</note> being ſtrangers from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them.</hi> So then it is cleare, that ignorance is not the mother of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, as the Papiſts doe auouch: but it is the mother of errour, death and deſtruction, as the Scripture affirmeth. Our Lord foreſéeing the great danger of ignorance (how thereby thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are carried headlong into Hell) doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 39.</note> al men to ſearch the Scriptures, which

               <p>This is a thing that muſt bée excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly laboured in of vs, which are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Preachers of the Goſpell. And héere is required diligence and (as we ſay) double di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: for the people are, euery where, very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. Some are ſtones, altogether vncapable
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:13922:173"/>
of inſtruction: others are froward and wilfull. Some will receiue the doctrine: but not the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: ſome againe are altogether ſet vpon pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhneſſe, and cauilling. So that a man were better take vpon him the charge of kéeping Wolues and Beares, then the charge of ſouls. For it is the hardeſt thing in the world, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme mens diſorders, and to bring them into order, to pull mens ſoules out of the kingdome of Sathan, and to bring them to God. It is as we ſay, an endleſſe péece of worke, an infinite toyle, a labour of all labours: I quake to thinke of it. For, men are ſo obſtinate and irrefragable that they wil be brought into no order: they wil come vnder no yoake. They will not be ruled by God, nor bridled by his word. They wil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their owne ſwinge. They will run after their owne luſts and pleaſures. They will kicke and ſpurne, if they be reprooued. They will rage and ſtorme if you goe about to curbe them, and reſtraine them of their wils, likings, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. They wil haue their wils, and follow their old faſhions; ſay what you will, and doe what you can.</p>
               <p>Is it not thinke you a buſie péece of worke, to ſmooth and ſquare ſuch Timber-logs, ſo full of knots and knobs? Is it not a tedious and irkeſome thing, to thinke vpon? And would it not kill a mans heart to goe about it? For, how
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:13922:173"/>
hard a thing is it, to bring ſuch into frame, as are ſo farre out of frame?</p>

               <p>Well ſir, you can but doe your ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and commit the ſucceſſe to God. You can but plant and water: let God giue the encreaſe. You are Miniſters of the letter: but not of the ſpirit. You baptiſe with water: but not with the holy Ghoſt. If you therefore preach dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, exhort, admoniſh, and reprooue, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, and priuately: ſtudying by all good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of life, and ſeeking with all good zeale, care, and conſcience, to do the vttermoſt that in you lieth, to reduce them from their euill waies; I take it, you are diſcharged, though they remaine ſtubborne and incorrigible. For you know, what the Lord ſaith by his Prophet: If you doe admoniſh them and giue them warning, then you ſhall bee diſcharged, and<note place="margin">Eze. 33. 9.</note> their blood ſhall bee required at their owne hands.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>You haue ſpoken the truth. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſith ſome muſt needs take vpon them this ſo great a charge, it will bée our beſt courſe, to labour much with them in Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and priuate inſtructions: and that in moſt familiar and plaine manner. For much good hath béene done, and is done, this way. The ignorant ſort muſt be much labored vpon this way: and ſo, no doubt, much good may be done.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:13922:174"/>
For, in all labour there is profit. Héerein, we<note place="margin">Pro. 14. 23.</note> (that are the Miniſters of Chriſt) muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to bée abaſed, and to teach the poore igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people in moſt plaine maner, aſking them many eaſie queſtions, &amp; often queſtioning with them in moſt plaine and louing maner, till we haue brought them to ſome taſte and ſmacke of the principles of Chriſtian Religion. We muſt not be aſhamed to vſe repetitions, and tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and to tell them one thing twenty times ouer, and ouer againe, héere a line, and there a line: héere a little, and there a little: precept<note place="margin">Iſa. 28. 10.</note> vpon precept, as the Prophet ſpeaketh. I know riht well, nothing goeth more againſt the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke of a ſcholar, and him that is learned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede, then to doe thus. It is as irkeſome and tedious, as to teach A. B. C. Some can, at no hand, endure it. But truely, truely I finde now, after long experience, that if we will doe any good to theſe ſimple and ignorant ſoules, we muſt enter into this courſe: and wée may not be aſhamed of it. For, it will be our crowne, and our glory, to winne ſoules, howſoeuer wée be abaſed. Let vs therefore be well content to ſtoupe downe, that Chriſt may be exalted. Let vs be abaſed, that God may be honoured. Let vs doe all things in great loue to Chriſt, who hath ſaid: <hi>If thou loueſt me, feede, feede, feede<note place="margin">Ioh. 21. 15.</note> my flocke.</hi> Let vs therefore teſtifie our loue to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:13922:174"/>
him, by féeding his flocke. Let vs doe all things in great loue and déepe compaſſion towards the poore ſoules, that goe aſtray. As it is ſaid, that our Lord Jeſus was mooued to pity, and his bowels did yearne, to ſée the people as ſhéepe without a ſhéepeheard. Let it likewiſe mooue vs throughly, and make our hearts to bléede, to ſée ſo many poore ſhéepe of Chriſt wandring and ſtraying in the mountaines, and wilderneſſe of this world, caught in euery bramble, and hanged in euery buſh, ready to be deuoured of the Wolfe. Thus haue I ſhewed you, what courſe (in my iudgement) is beſt to be taken, for the deliuering of poore ignorant ſoules, out of the captiuity of Sathan and ſinne.</p>

               <p>Now, as you haue declared, what courſe is beſt to be followed of your part, which are the Miniſters and Preachers of the Goſpell; ſo I pray you ſhew, what is beſt to be done of vs, which are the people of God.</p>

               <p>The beſt counſell that I can giue you if it were for my life, is, to be much exerciſed in the word of God, both in the hearing, reading, and meditation thereof: and alſo to purchaſe, vnto your ſelfe the ſincere miniſtery of the Goſpell, and to make conſcience to liue vnder it, eſtéeming your ſelfe happy if you haue it, though you want other things: and vnhappie if you haue it not, though you haue all other
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:13922:175"/>
things. For it is a péereleſſe pearle, an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Jewell. For the purchaſing whereof, we are aduiſed by our Lord Jeſus, to ſel all that we haue, rather then to goe without it. Againe,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 44.</note> our Sauiour Chriſt giueth the ſame counſell, to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell<note place="margin">Apo. 3. 18</note> thee, to buy of me gold tried by the fire, that thou maieſt be rich: and white raiment, that thou maiſt be cloathed, and that thy filthy nakedneſſe do not appeare: and annoint thine eies with eie-ſalue, that thou maiſt ſee.</hi> Where you ſée, the word of God is compared to moſt pretious gold, whereby we are made ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally rich: and to glittering attire, wherewith our naked ſoules are cloathed: and to an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalue, wherewith our ſpirituall blindneſſe is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. We are aduertiſed alſo by Jeſus Chriſt whoſe counſell is euer the beſt, that wée ſhould buy theſe things, whatſoeuer they coſt vs. The ſame counſel alſo giueth wiſe <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Buy the truth: but ſell it not.</hi> So then you ſée,<note place="margin">Pro. 23. 23.</note> the counſell which héerein I giue you, is not mine owne; but the counſell of <hi>Ieſus</hi> himſelfe, and <hi>Salomon</hi> the wiſe. And who can or who dare except againſt their counſell?</p>

               <p>Is your meaning, that men muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie frequent preaching of the word? will not bare reading ſerue the turne?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Theol.</speaker>
               <p>I tolde you before, that reading is
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:13922:175"/>
good, profitable, and neceſſary: but yet it is not ſufficient. We muſt not content our ſelues with that onely: but wée muſt goe further, and get vnto our ſelues the ſound preaching of the Goſpell, as the chiefeſt and moſt princiyall meanes, which God hath ordained and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for the ſauing of men. As it is plainely ſet downe, <hi>1. Cor. 1. 21. When as the world (by wiſedome) knew not God, in the wiſedome of God, it pleaſed God, by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching, to ſaue them that beleeue.</hi> The meaning of it is, that when as men, neither by naturall wiſedome, nor the contemplation of the creatures, could ſufficiently attaine to the true knowledge of God; the Lord, according to his heauenly and infinite wiſedome thought of an other courſe: which is, to ſaue men by preaching; which the world counteth fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And by the way note, that the preaching of the word is not a thing of humane inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but it is Gods owne deuice, and came firſt out of his braine, as the next and néereſt way to ſaue mens ſoules.</p>
               <p>Wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> alſo in the Booke of the Prouerbes telleth vs, that the preaching of Gods word (which hée calleth Uiſion, vſing the word of the Prophets, which called their Sermons Uiſions) is not a thing that may be ſpared, or that wée may be at choiſe whether
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:13922:176"/>
we haue it or no: but he maketh it to be of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity vnto eternall life. For he ſaith, <hi>Where viſion faileth, the people are left naked.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 29. 18.</note> So indéede, it is in the Originall. But the old tranſlation giueth vs the ſenſe, thus: <hi>Where the word of God is not preached, there the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple periſh.</hi> Then you ſée that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſtriketh it dead, in telling vs, that all they which are without preaching of the word, are in excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding danger of loſing their ſoules. Oh that men could be perſwaded of this! Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaith, that faith commeth by hearing the word preached. For hée ſaith: <hi>How can they<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note> heare, without a Preacher?</hi> If faith come by hearing the word preached, then I reaſon thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No preaching, no faith: no faith, no Chriſt: no Chriſt, no eternall life. For eternall life is only in him. Let vs then put them together, thus: Take away the word, take away faith: take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way faith, take away Chriſt: take away Chriſt, and take away eternall life. So then it followeth; Take away the word, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way eternall life.</p>
               <p>Or, wée may reade them backeward thus: If we will haue heauen, we muſt haue Chriſt: If we will haue Chriſt, we muſt haue faith. If we will haue faith, we muſt haue the word preached. Then it followeth thus. If we will haue heauen, we muſt haue the word preached.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:13922:176"/>
Then I conclude, that preaching generally, and for the moſt part, is of abſolute neceſſitie vnto eternall life; as meate is of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, for the preſeruation of our bodies; as graſſe and fodder are of abſolute neceſſity, for the vpholding of the life of beaſts; and water of abſolute neceſſity, for the life of fiſhes. Then, this being ſo, men are with great care and conſcience to heare the Goſpell preached, to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Sermons, to reſort much to Gods houſe and habitation, where his honour dwelleth: with <hi>Dauid</hi> to ſay; <hi>One thing haue I deſired<note place="margin">Pſal. 27. 4.</note> of the Lord, that I will require: euen that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord, all the daies of my life; to behold the beautie of the Lord, and to viſit his holy Temple.</hi> With godly<note place="margin">Luke. 14. 42. Ioh. 5. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Mary</hi> to ſay; <hi>One thing is neceſſary; and ſo chooſe the better part.</hi> With the poore Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Betheſda,</hi> to wait for the moouing of the waters by the Angell, that his impotency may be cured: I meane, that wée ſhould tie our ſelues to the firſt moouing of the ſpirituall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life, by the Preachers of the Goſpell; that our ſpiritual impotency may be holpen and relieued. For the miniſtery of the Goſpell is that golden pipe, whereby and where-through all the goodneſſe of GOD, all the ſwéeteneſſe of Chriſt, and all heauenly graces whatſoeuer are deriued vnto vs. Which thing was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:13922:177"/>
in the law by the Pomegranates in the ſkirts of <hi>Arons</hi> garments, and the golden Belles betwéene them round about: that is, a golden Bell, and a Pomegranate; a golden Bell, and a Pomegranate. The golden Belles<note place="margin">xod. 28. 33.</note> did ſignifie the preaching of the Goſpel, and the Pomegranates the ſwéet ſauour of Chriſtes death. Noting thereby that the ſwéet ſauour of Chriſts death, and all the benefits of his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould be ſpread abroad by the preaching of the Goſpell. Thus you ſée, that if euer men purpoſe to be ſaued, they muſt make more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the preaching of the Goſpel, then they haue done, &amp; not thinke, (as moſt men do) that they may be without it, &amp; yet doe well enough. And ſome had as léeue be without it, as haue it. For it doth but diſquiet them, and trouble their conſciences: but woe be vnto ſuch.</p>

               <p>Yet we ſee, where the word is ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached, there be many bad people: and the reaſons thereof, in mine opinion, are two. The one, that God taketh his holy ſpirit from many in hearing the word: ſo that their hearing is made vnfruitfull. The other, that the diuell hath an hundred deuices, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the effectuall working of the word: ſo as it ſhall doe no good at all, nor take any effect in multitudes of men. But you, Maſter <hi>Theologus,</hi> can better laie open this matter,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:13922:177"/>
then I. I pray you therefore ſpeake ſomething of it.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>The ſleights of Sathan, in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, are moe and more ſlie, then I, or any man elſe can poſſibly diſcouer. For who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deſcrie, or in ſufficient manner, to lay open the déepe ſubtilties, and moſt ſecret and ſinfull ſuggeſtions of the Diuell in the hearts of men: Hée is ſo cunning a crafts maſter this way, that none can perfectly trace him. His workings, in the hearts, of men, are with ſuch cloſe and hid deceits, and moſt methodicall and craftie conueyances, that none can ſufficiently finde them out. But yet notwithſtanding, I will béewray ſo much as I know, or can conceiue of his dealings with men that heare the word, that he may ſteale it out of their hearts, and make it fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and vnprofitable. Firſt of all, hée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirreth him and laboureth hard, to kéepe men faſt aſléepe in their ſinnes, that they may haue no care at all of their ſaluation: and therefore diſſwadeth them from hearing, or reading the word at all; leſt they ſhould bée awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. If this will not preuaile, but that they muſt néeds heare, then his craft is, to make their hearing vnprofitable, by ſléepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, dulneſſe by-thoughts, conceitedneſſe, and a thouſand ſuch like. If this will not ſerue
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:13922:178"/>
the turne, but that the word doth get within them, and worke vpon them (ſo as thereby they grow to ſome knowledge and vnderſtanding of the truth) then he practiſeth another way, which is, to make them reſt themſelues vpon their bare knowledge, and ſo become altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienceleſſe. If this will not ſuffice, but that men fall to doing, and leaue ſome ſinnes, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the groſſe ſinnes of the world, and doe ſome good, then he perſwadeth them to truſt to thoſe doings without Chriſt, and to thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues well inough, becauſe they doe ſome good, and leaue ſome euill. If this bée not enough, but that men attaine vnto the true iuſtifying faith which apprehendeth Chriſt, and reſteth vpen his merits, then he deuiſeth how to ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh the beauty of their faith, and weaken their comfort, through many frailties and wants, yea groſſe downefalles, and ranke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils: ſo as they ſhall bée but ſpotted and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous Chriſtians. If this weapon will not worke, but that Chriſtians doe ioyne all good vertues with their faith, and abundantly ſhine foorth in all fruits of righteouſneſſe, then he caſteth about another way: which is, to daunt and dampe them with diſcouragements: as pouertie, neceſſity, ſickneſſe, reproches, contempts, perſecutions &amp;c. If none of all theſe will doe the déeds, but that men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:13922:178"/>
beléeue in Chriſt, and patiently, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endure all afflictions, then his laſt refuge is, to blow them vp with gun-powder: that is, to puffe them vp with a pride of their gifts, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſtrength, and ſo to giue them an vtter ouerthrow whileſt they doe not walke humbly and giue God the praiſe of his gifts.</p>
               <p>Thus haue you a little taſte of Sathans cunning, in making the word vnfruitfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs.</p>

                  <hi>that are therein ſhall be burnt vp.</hi> The Apoſtle telleth vs, that at the comming of Chriſt, all the whole world ſhall bée of a light fire: and that all caſtels, towers, goodly buildings, gold, ſiluer, veluets, ſilkes, and all the glittering hue, glory, and beauty of this world, ſhall be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to powder and aſhes.

The Sword-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, Trumpetters, and harbengers go before; many flaunting and ſtately perſonages follow after. Now then, if the comming of mortall
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:13922:183"/>
Princes be ſo pompous, and glorious: how much more glorious ſhall the comming of the ſonne of man be, in whoſe ſight, all mortal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are but duſt? The Scriptures doe affirme, that his ſecond comming vnto iudgement, ſhall be with ſuch reſplendent and vnſpeakeable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that euen the moſt excellent creatures ſhall bluſh at it. For <hi>the Sunne ſhall be darkened: the<note place="margin">Math. 24. 29.</note> Moone ſhall not giue her light: and the ſtarres ſhall fall from heauen.</hi> Meaning thereby, that the moſt glorious and bright-ſhining creatures ſhall be clouded and obſcured, by the vnconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable brightneſſe of Chriſts comming.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, is noted vnto vs the terrour of Chriſts comming, in this; that immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, the very ſea ſhall quake and tremble, and in his kind crie out. For it is ſaid, <hi>that the<note place="margin">Luk. 21. 25. 1.</note> ſea ſhall roare</hi> (and make a noiſe in moſt doleful and lugubrious manner) <hi>and mens hearts ſhall faile them for feare, and for looking after thoſe things, which ſhall come on the world: for the powers of heauen ſhall be ſhaken.</hi> Oh, what ſhal become of ſwearers, drunkards, whore-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, &amp; ſuch like, in that day! They ſhall ſéeke to créepe into an auger hole, to hide their heads. They ſhall then cry wo and alas, that euer they were borne. They ſhal wiſh that they had neuer béen borne, or that their mother had born them toads. And, as it is ſaid in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:13922:183"/>
                  <hi>They ſhall ſay to the mountains and rocks, Fall<note place="margin">Apoc. 6. 16.</note> on vs, and hide vs from the preſence of him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lambe. For the great day of his wrath is come, and who can ſtand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſée therfore, that the comming of Chriſt ſhall not be baſe and contemptible, as in his firſt viſitation: but it ſhall bée moſt terrible, princely, and glorious. And as the Scriptures doe affirme, that his comming ſhall bee with great terror and dread: ſo alſo they doe ſhew, that it ſhall bée very ſudden and vnlooked for. For <hi>the day of the Lord ſhall come as a theefe<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 10. 1. Theſ. 5. 2.

For few there be that thinke of any ſuch matter. Sith therefore the ſecond appearing of Chriſt ſhall bée with ſuch ſuddenneſſe, let vs feare and tremble: for all ſudden things are to be feared.</p>

In another place the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>That<note place="margin">2.

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:13922:184"/>
to thinke of this, that Chriſt ſhall come to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vengeance vnto them.

                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 10.</note> high and lowe, rich and poore, king and begger, one and other; as it is plainly ſet down in the 20.

Oh what a great day will that be, when as the whole world ſhall appeare toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at once! If a king marry his ſonne and dif other Kings, Emperours, Dukes, &amp; Nobles to the marriage, with all their pompe &amp; traine, we vſe to ſay: Oh what a mariage, what a mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, what a doe, what a great day will there be! but when the vniuerſal world ſhal be aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together (not only al Monarks, Kings, and Princes, but all other, that euer haue béen from the beginning of the world, al that are, and ſhal be) what a day will that be!

Then with how much more glory and maieſty ſhall the Sonne of God be brought vnto his royall Throne! Thus then Chriſt being ſet vpon his iudgement ſeat, all the vngodly ſhall bée con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented before him, and he ſhall ſtand ouer them with a naked ſword in his hand.

making conſcience of all our waies, and ſtudying to pleaſe God in all things, and to be fruitfull in all good works, liuing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, iuſtly, &amp; holily in this preſent euill world, and ſhewing foorth the vertues of him which hath called vs out of darkeneſſe to this maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light; ſo that we may be prepared againſt the day of his appearing, that it may not take vs tardy. For our life ought to be a continuall meditation of death.

As it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of a godly man in the Primitue church; that whether he eat or dranke, or whatſoeuer he did, hée thought alwaies hée heard the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of the Lord, with theſe words; <hi>Ariſe yee dead, and come vnto iudgement.</hi> Put caſe it were certainly knowne, that Chriſt wold come to iudgement the next Midſommer-day; Oh what an alteration wold it make in the world, how would men change their minds &amp; affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons! who would care for this world! who would ſet his heart vnto riches! Who would regard braue apparel! Who durſt deceiue or oppreſſe! who durſt be drunke! Who durſt ſweare, lie, and commit adultery! Nay, would not all men giue vp themſelues to the obedience of God? would not all ſerue him diligently? would

Sée then, what the knowledge of a certaine day approaching would effect. And ought we not to doe all theſe things with as great care &amp; zeale, ſéeing the day is vncertaine? For, who knoweth whether Chriſt will come this moneth, or the next; this yeere, or next?

               <p>Concerning the torments of hell, (I do note thrée things which I will briefly ſpeake of) and they be theſe: The extremity, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, and remedileſneſſe thereof. Firſt, touching the extremity thereof, it ſtandeth ſpecially in theſe thrée things. Firſt, that it is a ſeparation from all ioy and comfort of the preſence of God. Secondly, that it is an eternall fellowſhip with the diuell and his angels. Thirdly, it is a féeling of the horrible wrath of God; which ſhall ſeize vpon body and ſoule &amp; ſhall feed on them (as fire deth vpon pitch and brimſtone) for euer. The<note place="margin">Apo. 21. 8. Luke. 13. 28. Mat. 9. 44.</note> ſcriptures do note the extremity of it, in calling <hi>it a lake, that burneth with fire &amp; brimſtone, for euer:</hi> in ſaying, <hi>there ſhal be weeping &amp; gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth:</hi> in affirming, that <hi>their worme di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not,</hi> (meaning the worme that gnaweth their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, or their torment of conſcience) &amp; <hi>the fire neuer goeth out:</hi> in tearming it <hi>Tophet, <hi>which is deepe and large: &amp; the burning thereof is fire and much wood:</hi>
                  </hi> and that <hi>the breath of the Lord, as a riuer of brimſtone, doth kindle it</hi> All theſe things hée terrible to our ſenſes: and yet can they not fully expreſſe the thing, as it
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:13922:188"/>
is indéed. For, no heart can conceiue, or tongue expreſſe the greatneſſe and extreamity of the torments of hell. As the ioyes of heauen neuer entred into the heart of man: no more did the torments of hell. All the torments and troubles that fall vpon men in this life, are but as ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of the fornace of Gods totall wrath. All fires are but as it were pictures of fire, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of hell fire. For as one writeth: Hell fire is ſo extreamely hot, that it wil burne vp a man ſeuen mile, before he come at if. Yet the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, being alwaies in it, ſhall neuer be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it. As the <hi>Salamander</hi> is alwaies in the fire, and neuer conſumeth ſo the wicked ſhall be alwaies in the fire of hell, &amp; neuer conſume. For hell is a death alwaies liuing, &amp; an end alwaies beginning. It is a grieuous thing to a man that is very ſick, to lie vpon a featherbed: how much more vpon a hot gridiron! but how moſt of all to burne alwaies in hell fire, &amp; neuer be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med! An other extreamity of it conſiſſeth in this, that the torments of hell are vniuerſall: that is, in euery memberat once: head, eies, tongue, téeth, throat, ſtomacke, backe, belly heart, ſides, &amp;c. All puniſhments of this life are particular. For ſome are pained in their head, ſome in their backe, ſome in their ſtomacke, &amp;c. Yet ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular paines are ſuch, as a man would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, to gaine all the world. But, for a man to be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:13922:189"/>
in all parts at once, what ſight more lamentable! who could but take pity of a dog in the ſtréet, in that caſe! Thus then wée ſée, that the extremity of Hell torments is greater, then can be conceiued or vttered. For, who can vtter that, which is incomprehenſible? We can go no further in comprehending that which is incomprehenſible, then to know it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible.</p>

               <p>The Scriptures do ſet forth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of hell torments, in ſaying: they are for euer. The wicked ſhall be caſt into the lake, that burneth with fire and brimſtone for euer. The fire neuer goeth out. When as many hundred thouſand yéeres are expired, as there be ſtones by the Sea ſide: yet ſtill there be ſo many more to come. For that which hath no end, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come to an end. If all the Arithmeticians in the world were ſet a worke to do nothing but number all the daies of their life, euen the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt numbers that they could poſſibly ſet down, and ſhould in the end adde all their numbers together; yet could they neuer come any thing néere to that length of time, wherein the wicked ſhalbe tormented. If the whole circumference of the heauens were writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about with figures
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:13922:189"/>
of Arithmeticke, from the Eaſt to the Weſt, and from the Weſt to the Eaſt againe; yet could it not containe that infinite time, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable yéeres, wherein all vnbeléeuers ſhal ſuffer eternall torture. For, in things infinite, time hath no place. For time is the meaſure of thoſe things which are ſubiect to meaſure. Therefore, becauſe Hell torments are infinite, they cannot be meaſured by any time: neither can that which is infinite, be diminiſhed. For if you ſubtract from that which is infinite, ten thouſand thouſand millions of milions, yet it is thereby nothing diminiſhed or made leſſe. Put caſe a man ſhould once in an hundred thouſand yéeres, take a ſpooneful of water, out of the great Ocean Sea, how long would it be, ere hée had ſo emptied it! Yet ſhall a man ſooner empty the Sea, by taking out a ſpoonfull once in a hundred thouſand yéeres, then the damned ſoule ſhall haue any eaſe. Therfore a certain writer ſaith, <hi>If a damned ſoule might be tormented in Hell but a thouſand yeeres, and then haue eaſe, there were ſome comfort in it: (ſor then there would be hope it would come to an end,) but, ſaith he, this word euer killeth the hart.</hi> Oh conſider this yée that forget God! O yée carnall worldlings, thinke on this in time! For, if you will not now be moued in hearing, you ſhal be the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cruſhed in péeces in feeling. What auaileth it, to liue in all
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:13922:190"/>
poſſible pleaſures, and carnall delights héere, for ſome 60. yéeres, and then to ſuffer this eternall torment? What ſhal it profit a man, to win the whole world &amp; loſe his ſoule? they be more then mad, which will hazard their ſoules, for a little profit, and a few ſtinking pleaſures. But this is the nature of men; they will haue the preſent ſwéet (come of it what wil) though they pay ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo deare for it: though they goe to the higheſt price: though hey loſe their ſoules for it. Oh the vnſpeakeable blindnes &amp; madnes of the men of this world! The diuell hath put out their eies: &amp; therfore leadeth them whither he liſt. For who cannot lead a blind man whither he liſt? <hi>Nahaſh<note place="margin">1. Sam. 11. 2.</note> the Ammonite</hi> would make no couenant with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but vpon condition that he might put out all their right eies.

               <p>The ſcriptures do affirme, that as the torments of hel are extreme, ſo they are without all hope of remedy; as it is written: <hi>A man can<note place="margin">Pſal. 49. 8.</note> by no meanes redeeme his brother; he can not giue his ranſome vnto God: ſo precious is the redemption of the ſoule, and the continuance for euer.</hi> To this purpoſe <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to the<note place="margin">Luke 16. 26.</note> rich man, being in hell torments: <hi>Betwixt you</hi>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:13922:190"/>
                  <hi>and vs, there is a great gulfe ſet; ſo that they which would goe from hence to you, cannot: neither can they come from thence, to vs.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus alſo ſaith; <hi>What ſhall a man giue<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> for the recompence of his ſoule?</hi> Where our Sauiour doth plainely affirme, that there is no ranſome or recompence, though neuer ſo great, to be giuen for a damned ſoule. For the ſoule being in Hell, can neuer be releaſed, it is paſt remedy. No meanes whatſoeuer can doe any good. No gold, no ſiluer, no friends, no riches, no power, no policy, no flattery, no bribery, no reach, no fetch or deuice whatſoeuer can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile one iot. For a man being once in Hell, hath no remedy. He is in cloſe priſon, he is ſhut vp vnder the hatches for euer: there is no getting out againe. He muſt ſuffer perpetuall impriſonment. He cannot bring a writ of falſe impriſonment: (becauſe hée is laid in by the moſt righteous and iuſt Judge, who cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly doe any wrong,) but he muſt lie by it. For béeing there once, he is there for euer. If all the Angels of Heauen ſhould entreat for a damned ſoule: If <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſhould make great ſute: If all the Prophets, Apoſtles &amp; Martyrs, ſhold be continuall ſolicitors of Chriſt for releaſe: if the father ſhould make requeſt for his ſon, or the mother for her daughter: yet can none of theſe be heard: they muſt all haue the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:13922:191"/>
repulſe. For, the ſentence of Chriſt cannot be reuerſed; his decrée is vnrepealeable. The due conſideration of theſe things, may make all hearts to quake, and all knées to tremble. In the troubles and afflictions of this life, though a man come in neuer ſo great dangers, yet he may winde out againe, by one meanes or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by mony, or friendſhip, or rewards, or ſuch like meanes: but in Hell fire this is it that gripes, &amp; maketh the heart deſpaire, that there is no remedy at all to be vſed. If we ſhould aſke of a damned ſoule, or an afflicted conſcience, what they would giue for the eaſe and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſoules: they would anſwere, the whole world; howſoeuer ſecure worldlings, and wicked Atheiſts (which ſee nothing, nor feele nothing) make nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Héere, by the way, let vs conſider the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the loſſe of a mans ſoule; which we ſhall the better perceiue and ſée into, if we can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right value and priſe the ſoule. If therefore it be demaunded, what is the price of the ſoule, or what is it worth; our Lord Jeſus anſwereth; that it is more worth, then all the world. For ſaith he, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man, to win all the<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> world, and loſe his ſoule?</hi> Therefore the ſoule of the pooreſt begger is more worth then all the world. Then I reaſon thus: if the ſoule bée more worth then all the world, then the loſſe of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:13922:191"/>
it is greater, then the loſſe of the whole world. For indéed it is a loſſe of all loſſes; an vnreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerable loſſe. If a man ſhould haue his houſe burnt ouer his head, and all that he hath conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in one night, it were a great loſſe. If a Merchant venturer ſhould loſe twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound in one venture, in one ſhippe, or, as they ſay, in one bottome, it were a very great loſſe. If a king ſhould loſe his crowne and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it were an excéeding great loſſe. But the loſſe of the ſoule is a thouſand time more than all theſe: it is a matter of infinite importance. If a Tenant bée caſt out of the fauour of his Landlord, it is a matter of griefe. If a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Secretary be caſt out of fauour with his Lord, ſo that hée taketh a pritch againſt him, it is a matter of great ſorrow. If a Nobleman himſelfe be diſcountenanced, &amp; caſt out of all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with his Prince, that was in great fauour, it is a corſey, a heart ſmart, and a matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding gréeuance. But, to be eternally ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from God, to be ſhut out of his fauor, and to be caſt away from his preſence, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Angels, is a matter of infinit more dolour and torment. Marke then and behold, what a thing it is for a man to loſe his ſoule. Oh therefore that men would bée wiſe in Gods feare, that they would looke out in time, &amp; make prouiſion for their ſoules. Now then, to cloſe vp
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:13922:192"/>
this whole point, the ſumme of all that hath béene ſaid, is this: That the torments of Hell are endleſſe, eaſeleſſe, and remedileſſe.</p>

               <p>Truely, I muſt néeds thinke that the promiſes of mercy and forgiueneſſe of ſinne, made in the Goſpell, doe belong vnto you, and that Jeſus Chriſt is yours: you are truely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in him, and haue a proper right vnto him. For hée came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance. You doe now féele your ſelfe to be a finner, you are grieued for your ſins, you are wearie of them: therefore Jeſus Chriſt is for you: all the benefits of his paſſion belong to you. Againe he ſaith, <hi>The whole need not the<note place="margin">Matt. 9. 12.</note> Phyſician, but they that are ſicke.</hi> But you doe acknowledge your ſelfe to be ſicke of ſin: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt Jeſus wil be your Phyſician; he wil ſwaddle you, and lappe you; hee will binde vp all your ſores; he wil heale al your wounds; he
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:13922:194"/>
will annoint them with the oyle of his mercy; he will ſmile vpon you, and ſhew you a ioyfull countenance; he will ſay vnto you, your ſins are forgiuen.</p>
               <p>In him you ſhall haue reſt and peace to your ſoule: Through him, you ſhall haue eaſe and comfort. For he taketh pity of all ſuch as mourne for their ſinnes, as you doe. Hée did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth you, and all that are in your caſe, to come vnto him, and he will helpe you. <hi>Come vnto me</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 11. 28.</note> (ſaith he,) <hi>all yee that are weary and heauy loaden, and I will eaſe you.</hi> You are one of them that are bid to come: for you are weary of your ſinnes, you féele the burden of them. Chriſt is altogether for ſuch as you are. He regardeth not the world, that is, the prophane and vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men. He bids not them come, he praieth not for them. <hi>I pray not for the world,</hi> ſaith hée.<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 9.</note> They haue no part nor intereſt in him.

He is a pillow of downe to all aking heads, &amp; aking conſciences. Be of good comfort therefore, feare nothing: for aſſuredly Chriſt and all his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is yours.

happy are you that haue ſuch a Mediator and high Prieſt. Reſt therefore wholly vpon him, and vpon that perfect, eternal, and propitiatory ſacrifice which hée hath once offered. Apply Chriſt, apply his merits, apply the promiſes to your ſelfe, and to your owne conſcience: ſo ſhall they doe you good &amp; bring great comfort to your ſoule. For put caſe you had a moſt excellent and ſoueraigne ſalue, which would cure any wound it were laide vnto; yet if you ſhould locke it vp in your cheſt, &amp; neuer apply it to your wound, what good could it doe you? Euen ſo the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes &amp; merits of Chriſt are a ſpirituall ſalue, which will cure any wound of the ſoule: but if we doe not apply them to our ſelues by faith, they can doe vs no good. You muſt therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Chriſt, &amp; all the premiſes of the Goſpel, to your ſelfe by faith, &amp; ſtand fully perſwaded, that whatſoeuer he hath done vpon the Croſſe, he hath done for you particularly. For what is the iuſtifying faith, but a full perſwaſion of Gods particular loue to vs in Chriſt? The generall &amp; confuſed knowledge of Chriſt &amp; of his Goſpell, auaileth not to eternal life. Labour therefore to haue the true vſe of all theſe great and precious promiſes: ſticke faſt to Chriſt, for through him only we haue remiſſion of ſins, and eternall life. <hi>To him all the Prophets giue witneſſe</hi> (ſaith S.<note place="margin">Act. 10. 45.</note>

                  <hi>receiue remiſſion of their ſins.</hi> Where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle telleth vs, that if a graund Jury of prophets were panelled to teſtifie of the way &amp; meanes to eternal life, they would al with one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent bring in a verdit, that remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſins &amp; eternal life are only in Chriſt. Let vs heare the fore-man ſpeak, &amp; one or two of the reſt, for in the mouth of two or thrée witneſſes ſhall euery word ſtand. The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith: <hi>He was wounded for our<note place="margin">Eſa. 53. 5</note> tranſgreſſions; he was broken for our iniquities; the chaſtiſement of our peace was vpon him, &amp; with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> This great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet we ſée doth plainly affirme, that Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for our ſins &amp; by his ſuffering we are ſaued. The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> teſtifieth the ſame thing, ſaying; <hi>Behold the daies come</hi> (ſaith the Lord)<note place="margin">Ier. 23. 5</note> 
                  <hi>that I wil raiſe vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> a righteous branch &amp; a king ſhall raigne and proſper, &amp; ſhall execute iudgment &amp; iuſtice in the earth. In his daies, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> ſhall be ſaued, &amp; <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhal dwell ſafely; and this is the name wherby they ſhall call him; the Lord our righteouſnes.</hi> This Prophet tumpeth with the other. For he ſaith, that Chriſt is the righteous branch, &amp; that he is our righteouſnes, which is al one as if he had ſaid, our ſins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned only through him, &amp; through him we are made righteous. Moreouer he affirmeth, that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dah</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, the Church, ſhall be ſaued by him. The Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi> that I may ſpeake
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:13922:196"/>
it with reuerence, telleth the ſame tale word for word. Hée auoucheth the ſame thing with the other two Prophets. For he ſaith: <hi>In that day a Fountaine ſhall be opened to the houſe of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 13. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Dauid, <hi>and to the inhabitants of</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>for ſinne, and for vncleanneſſe.</hi>
                  </hi> The meaning of the prophet is, that in the daies of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the fountaine of Gods mercy in Chriſt, ſhould be opened, and let out, to waſh away the ſinnes and vncleanneſſe of the Church. So then we ſée, that theſe thrée great witneſſes doe all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée in this, that through Chriſt onely, wée are waſhed from our ſins, and through him onely wée are made righteous. Séeing then that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life is onely in the ſonne, therefore he that hath the ſon hath life. Be of good courage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O <hi>Aſunetus,</hi> for no doubt you haue the ſon, &amp; therfore eternal life. Feare not your ſins, for they cannot hurt you. For as all the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and all the moſt righteous men that euer liued vpon the face of the earth, if it were yours, could doe you no good, without Chriſt; ſo all the ſinnes in the world can do you no hurt, being in Chriſt. <hi>For there is no condemnation to them which are in<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Plucke vp a good heart therfore, be no more heauy and ſadde; for if you be found in Chriſt, clothed with his perfect righteouſneſſe, being made yours through faith, what can the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:13922:196"/>
diuel ſay to you? what can the Law doe? They may wel hiſſe at you, but they cannot ſting you: they may grin at you, but they cannot hurt you. For who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33.</note> Gods elect? It is God that iuſtifieth; who ſhall condemne? It is Chriſt which is dead, or rather which is riſen againe, who is alſo at the right hand of God, &amp; maketh requeſt for vs. Reioice<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 4.</note> in the Lord therfore: &amp; againe I ſay reioice. For greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the world: our Lord Jeſus is ſtronger then all. None can plucke you out of his hands: he is a ſtrong Mediator; he hath conquered all our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual enemies; he hath ouer come hell, death, &amp; damnation; he hath led captiuitie captiue; he hath ſpoiled principalities &amp; powers; and hath<note place="margin">Col. 2. 15.</note> made an open ſhew of them, &amp; triumphed ouer them in his croſſe. He hath moſt triumphantly ſaid, <hi>O death, I will be thy death; O graue, I wil<note place="margin">Hoſ. 13. 14. 1. Cor. 15. 55.</note> be thy deſtruction: O death where is thy ſting? O hell where is thy victorie?</hi> Séeing then you haue ſuch a Mediator and high Prieſt, as hath conquered the helliſh armie, and ſubdued all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall power, what néed you to doubt, what néed you to feare any more? Moreouer you are to vnderſtand, and to be perſwaded, that Gods mercy is excéeding great towards penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, &amp; all ſuch as mourne for their tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.</note> according as he ſaith: <hi>At what time ſoeuer</hi>

                  <hi>a ſinner doth repent him of his ſinnes from the bottome of his heart, he will put them all out of his remembrance.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> doth moſt liuely &amp; fully deſcribe vnto vs, the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nature of God, in the 103. Pſalme; where he ſaith: <hi>The Lord is full of compaſſion and<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.</note> mercy, ſlow to anger, &amp; of great kindnes: he wil not alwaies chide, neither keepe his anger for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; he hath not dealt with vs after our ſins, nor rewarded vs according to our iniquities. For as high as the heauen is aboue the earth, ſo great is his mercy towards thoſe that feare him. As far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, ſo far hath he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued our ſins from vs. As a father hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on his children; ſo hath the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on them that feare him. For he knoweth whereof we be made; he remembreth that we are but duſt.</hi> The Hiſtorie of the loſt ſonne doth moſt notably ſet foorth the wonderfull mercie of God towards penitent ſinners. There is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how the Lord doth embrace, tender &amp; make much of ſuch poore ſinners, as haue broken and contrite hearts for their ſinnes: for it is ſaide; that when the father ſaw his repenting ſonne a<note place="margin">Luk. 15.</note> great way off, he had compaſſion on him, and ran and fell on his necke, and kiſſed him, and cloathed him with the beſt robe, put it on him, put a ring on his hand, &amp; ſhooes on his féet, and cauſed the fat calfe to be killed for him. Euen ſo
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:13922:197"/>
the euer laſting father doth reioyce at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of any of his loſt ſons. Yea, there is ioy in the preſence of the angels of God, for one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that conuerteth. Moreouer the Lord doth moſt liuely expreſſe his merciful nature and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, in this, that he is very loath we ſhould periſh &amp; willingly caſt away our ſelues. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore often in the holy ſcriptures he doth mourne for vs, bewaile our wretchednes, and taketh vp many pitifull complaints and lamentations for<note place="margin">Pſal 81. 13.</note> vs, ſaying: <hi>Oh that my people had hearkned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and Iſrael had walked in my waies.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>Oh that thou hadſt hearkened vnto my commandements; then had thy proſperity been<note place="margin">Eſay 48. 18.</note> as the floud, and thy righteouſneſſe as the waues of the Sea.</hi> Againe he mourningly complaineth<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6. 4.</note> by his Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Oh <hi>Ephraim,</hi> what ſhall I do vnto thee? Oh <hi>Iudah,</hi> how ſhall I entreat thee?</hi> And in another place: <hi>What could I doe more vnto my vineyard that I haue not done?</hi> Mark here how compaſſionately the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God doth yearn ouer vs, and euen as it were blée<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> vpon our wounds. The Apoſtle alſo doth note the rich mercy, &amp; maruellous loue of God to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind, in this, that he doth beſéech vs, &amp; pray vs by the miniſters of the goſpel, that we would be reconciled vnto him. The words are theſe: <hi>Now then are we embaſſadors for Chriſt,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> as though God did beſeech you through vs, we</hi>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:13922:198"/>
                  <hi>pray you in Chriſts ſted, that you be reconciled vnto God.</hi> Is it not a ſtrange thing that the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni potent God, ſhould fall to intreating of vs poore wretches? It is all one, as if a King ſhould intreat a begger, whom he may will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund: But the abundant mercy of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mankind, doth moſt of all conſiſt in this, that he hath giuen his onely ſonne for vs, when we were his enemies. As it is written: <hi>God<note place="margin">Iohn 3.</note> ſo loued the world, that he hath giuen his onely begotten ſonne; that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.</hi> Againe: <hi>God ſetteth out his loue towards vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 8.</note> ſeeing that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for vs: much more then being now iuſtified by his bloud, we ſhalbe ſaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrath through him. For if when we were enemies we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God by the death of his ſon, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaued by his life.</hi> In all this then wée may cléerely behold the infinite mercy of God towards vs poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For is it not a great matter that the ſonne of God ſhould take our nature vpon him, ſhould be ſo abaſed as he was, &amp; ſhould humble himſelf<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8.</note> to death, euen to the death of the Croſſe? For as the ſhadow of the Diall went backe ten degrées that <hi>Ezechias</hi> might receiue length of daies, &amp; much happineſſe: ſo Chriſt, the ſonne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, hath gone backe many degrées, that we
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:13922:198"/>
might haue eternall life. His humiliation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is our exaltation: his ſufferings our ioy: his death, our life. For we haue no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or refuge but onely his merits &amp; righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. He is our city of refuge, whither we muſt fly &amp; where we muſt take ſanctuary. He is the<note place="margin">Ier. 8. Iohn 5. 2.</note> Balme of <hi>Gilead,</hi> whereby our ſoules are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. He is that poole of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> where euery man may bée cured of what diſeaſe ſo euer hée<note place="margin">2. King. 5</note> hath. He is the riuer of <hi>Iordan,</hi> where <hi>Naaman</hi> may waſh away all his Leproſie. He is that Pellican, who by pecking a hole in his owne breſt, doth reſtore his yong to life againe by his blood. Yet one thing we muſt note by the way, which hath béene partly touched before: that al the mercy of God, and merits of Chriſt, are to be reſtrained onely to the elect: only to the true members of the Church. As plainely appeareth in the <hi>103. Pſalm.</hi> Where the mercies of God, which there are largely deſcribed, are reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned onely to them that feare him, kéepe his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, &amp; thinke vpon his Commandements to do them. And touching Chriſt, it is ſaid, that<note place="margin">Pſal. 130. Heb. 5. 6.</note> he is a prince, &amp; a Sauiour vnto <hi>Iſrael:</hi> &amp; that he ſhall redéeme <hi>Iſrael</hi> from all his iniquities. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it is written: That Chriſt being conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate, was made the author of eternall ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to them that obey him. None do or can obey him, but onely the Elect: therefore he is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:13922:199"/>
of ſaluation onely to the Elect. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the prophane world, whatſoeuer they ſay, whatſoeuer they brag &amp; boaſt, haue no true title or intereſt in him. This thing was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in the law, in this, that the mercy ſeate, which was a type of Gods mercy in Chriſt, &amp; the Arke which was a figure of the Church, were by the expreſſe commandement of God, fitted each to other, both in length and breadth. For as the Arke was two cubits and a halfe<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 10.</note> long, &amp; a cubit and a halfe broad: iuſt ſo was the mercy ſeate. Noting thereby, that the mercy of God in Chriſt, ſhould onely bée fitted to his church, &amp; belong only to the Church: ſo as not one without the Church ſhould be ſaued. For he that hath not the church for his mother, cannot haue God for his father. Laſtly we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that as God is infinit in mercy, &amp; of great compaſſion towards penitent ſinners: ſo alſo is he moſt conſtant in the courſe of his mercies towards his children. And therefore one of the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> carrieth this foote: <hi>His mercy endureth<note place="margin">Pſal. 138.</note> for euer; his mercy endureth for euer; his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy endureth for euer.</hi> Noting thereby both the conſtancy and eternity of Gods mercy. To the ſame purpoſe it is thus written: <hi>It is the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed; it is becauſe<note place="margin">Lament. 3. 22.</note> his compaſſions faile not.</hi> Let vs know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that God, as touching his mercy to his
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:13922:199"/>
children, is of a moſt conſtant and vnchangable nature. As he ſaith: <hi>I am the Lord I change not.</hi> For if God were of a changeable nature, as we are, and ſubiect to paſſions, then were we in a moſt miſerable caſe. Then muſt he néeds ſmite vs downe, and take vengeance of vs euery day and euery houre in the day: becauſe we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke him euery day, &amp; euery houre in the day. But the God of heauen is not as a man, that he ſhould be ſubiect to paſſions and affections: he is of a moſt conſtant and immutable nature. For though wée prouoke him euery day with new ſinnes, yet is he ſo farre off from taking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, that the next day he rewardeth vs with new mercies, and breaketh through all our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindeneſſe, to ſhew kindneſſe vnto vs: and through all our naughtineſſe to doe vs good. All our infirmities cannot make him breake off with vs, or ceaſe to loue vs. He is content to take vs with all faults: and to loue vs deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though we haue great faults. He regardeth not our infirmities, though we be oftentimes waiward and eluiſh, yet for all that, he loueth vs neuertheleſſe. Euen as a louing mother, though her young ſuckling crie all night, and be excéeding treafe and weiward, ſo as ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſt an houre in the night: yea, though ſhe endure much loathſomneſſe &amp; trouble with it, yet in the morning, when ſhe ariſeth, ſhe loueth
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:13922:200"/>
it neuertheleſſe, but dandles it, plaieth with it, ſmileth and laugheth vpon it: ſo the God of all mercies, whoſe loue towards vs far paſſeth the loue of mothers, though we gréeue him with our infirmities continually, yet loueth vs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, and is content to put vp all, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and forgiue all: for he is a moſt conſtant lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Where he once ſets and ſettles his loue, he loueth moſt conſtantly, nothing can alter him, nothing can remoue him, Euen as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when his little childe catcheth a fall, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his ſhinnes, and hurteth his face, is ſo far from being offended or diſpleaſed with him therefore, that he doth pity him, and bemone him, ſéeking remedies for his hurt: ſo our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Father, is ſo farre off from being angry &amp; diſpleaſed with vs for ſome ſlips and falles, that he doth the more pity vs, and lament our caſe. Euen as a louing and wiſe husband, though his wife haue many infirmities, yet knowing that ſhe loueth him dearely, and that her heart is with him, he is well content to winke at all her faults, to hide them, to beare with them, yea and to make nothing of them, louing her neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe for them. So our deare huſband and Spouſe Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe he knoweth we loue him, and that he hath our hearts, is content to beare with all our infirmities, and to make light of them. For this cauſe it is that he ſaith to
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:13922:200"/>
his Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles: Though ſhe was<note place="margin">Can. 4. 1.</note> blacke and full of infirmities, behold thou art faire my loue, behold thou art faire, thou art all faire my loue, there is no ſpot in thee.</hi> Marke that he calleth his Church faire, all faire, and without ſpot, not becauſe ſhe was ſo in herſelf, but becauſe ſhe was made ſo in him. And aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly the eternall God beholding her in his ſon doth ſo eſtéeme and account of her. For as hée that beholdeth any thing thorough a red glaſſe doth take it to be red, as is the colour of the glaſſe; ſo God the Father, beholding vs in his ſon, doth take vs to bée of the ſame nature and quality that he is: that is, perfectly righteous. For this cauſe it is that he loueth vs, &amp; ſetteth his heart vpon vs, and will not be remooued from vs. For his loue to his children, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies one and the ſame: although we haue not alwaies the like ſight and féeling of it. As the Moone is alwaies the ſame in ſubſtance and quantity, though ſometime it ſéemeth vnto vs to be waſted into a very ſmall ſcantling. Let vs know then to our great comfort, that the loue of God towards vs in his deare ſonne, is conſtant and alwaies alike, and that he wil not diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance vs or ſhake vs off for ſome infirmities, no nor yet for many infirmities: for the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God doth accept of his children, becauſe their generall care is good, and the vniuerſall Tenor
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:13922:201"/>
of their life tendeth vnto righteouſueſſe, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they may greatly faile in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar actions. Two or thrée fits of an Ague, do not prooue a diſeaſed body: nor two or thrée good daies a ſound body: euen ſo ſome few infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties doe not argue a wicked man; nor two or thrée good actions, a good man: but we muſt haue an eye to the certaine and ſettled courſe of a mans life. Euen as men are truely ſaid to walke in a way, when they goe in it, although ſometimes they trip and ſtumble: ſo Gods children doe walke in the way of righteouſnes, although ſometimes they ſtumble, and ſtep out of it; or ſometimes be violently haled out of it by theeues. For Sathan and the violence of our luſts, doe often hale vs out of the way, but we muſt get into it againe as ſoone as we are eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Now then to conclude &amp; draw to an end, ſith God is ſo infinitely mercifull, and conſtant in his mercy: ſith ſuch great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made to vs in Chriſt: ſith the Lord doth not regard our infirmities when our harts are with him: Therefore O <hi>Aſunetus,</hi> be of good chéere, let nothing trouble you, feare not the aſſaults of the Diuell, regard not his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: for aſſuredly your ſinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Chriſt is yours, heauen is yours, and all the promiſes of life and ſaluation belong vnto you: ſo as you néed not to doubt, you cannot

               <p>I am greatly comforted and cheared vp with your words: your preaching of the Goſpell, and laying open of Gods abundant mercy in Chriſt, and of the promiſes, do excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly reuiue me, and euen as it were put new life into me: they are as Sacke and Sugar vnto my ſoule, and more ſweete then the hony, and the hony combe: they are as Phyſicke to my ſicke ſoule, and as oyntment to my ſpirituall wounds. I doe now beginne to ſee what miſery is in man, and what mercy is in God. And I know by wofull experience, that where miſery is not felt, there mercy is not regarded: but now it hath pleaſed God to giue me ſome feeling of mine owne wretchedneſſe and miſery, and yet with good comfort in his mercy. For I thanke God for it, I begin now to grow to ſome perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that the promiſes doe belong vnto me, my ſins are forgiuen, and that I am one of them that ſhall be ſaued.</p>

Bleſſe vs in the vſe of the meanes, from day to day; make vs ſuch as thou wouldeſt haue vs to be, and ſuch as we deſire to be, working in vs both will and deede, purpoſe and power. For thou, O Lord, art all in all, thou wilt haue mercy vpon whom thou wilt haue mercy, and whom thou wilt thou hardeneſt. Haue mercy vpon vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (deere Father) and neuer leaue vs to our ſelues, nor to our owne wils, luſts, and deſires, but aſſiſt vs with thy good ſpirit, that we may continue to the end in a righteous courſe; that ſo at length we may be receiued into glorie, and be partakers of that immortall crowne which thou haſt laid vp for all that loue thee, and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call vpon thee.</p>
            <p>Further, we entreat thee, O heauenly father, to giue vs all things neceſſary for this life: as
<pb facs="tcp:13922:209"/>
foode, raiment, health, peace, liberty, and ſuch freedome from thoſe manifold miſeries which we lie open vnto euery day, as thou ſeeſt meete. Bleſſe vnto vs all the meanes which thou haſt put into our hands for the ſuſtenance of this fraile life. Bleſſe our ſtocke, and ſtore, corne, and cattell, trades &amp; occupations, and all the works of our hands: for thy bleſſing only maketh rich, and it bringeth no ſorrows with it. Giue vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a competency and ſufficiency of theſe outward bleſſings, as thou in thy heauenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſeeſt moſt needfull for vs. Moreouer, we humbly beſeech thee, (moſt louing Father) in great mercy to looke downe from heauen vpon thy whole Church, and euery member of it. Be fauourable vnto <hi>Sion,</hi> and build vp the wals of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Behold with the eye of pity, the great ruines and deſolations of thy Church. Heale vp the wounds, &amp; make vp the breaches thereof in all Nations. Regard it as thine owne flocke, tender it as thine owne family, dreſſe it as thine owne vineyard, loue it as thine owne ſpouſe. Think thoughts of peace to it, &amp; alwaies look vpon it in deepe compaſſion. Bleſſe it with thy grace, guide it with thy ſpirit, &amp; defend it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with thy mighty power: ſcatter the deuiſes confound the counſels, &amp; ouerthrow the forces of all that fight againſt it.

<pb facs="tcp:13922:209"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> that man of perdition, which ſetteth himſelfe againſt thee, and againſt all thy people. In thine appointed time we pray thee giue him a deadly downe-fall. Beat downe all his power and authority daily more and more: giue free paſſage to thy Goſpell in al kingdoms, that <hi>Babylon</hi> may fall and neuer riſe vp againe. The more the fauorites and adherents of <hi>Rome</hi> labour to vphold their Idolatrous kingdome, the more let it fall downe, euen as <hi>Dagon</hi> before the preſence of thine Arke. Poure downe the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of the fulneſſe of thy wrath vpon the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the beaſt, and let their riches, wealth, credite, and authority dry vp euery day more and more, as the riuer <hi>Euphrates.</hi> Let it pity thee, O Father, to ſee thine owne ſpouſe ſit as a deformed and forlorne woman heere below, weeping and mourning with her haire about her necke, hauing loſt all her beauty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe: cheere her vp (deare Father) glad her with the ioie of thy countenance, and ſo decke her and trimme her vp, that thou maieſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in her, as a Bridegroome in his Bride. Specially we intreat thee to haue mercy vpon thy Church in this land: intend good vnto vs and not euill: giue vs not ouer into the hands of the cruell <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as our ſinnes haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Scatter we pray thee, O Lord, the deuiſes, and breake the plots of all ſuch as haue plotted
<pb facs="tcp:13922:210"/>
the ouerthrow &amp; vtter ſubuerſion of this church and common-wealth. Bleſſe this Church more and more, with the continuance of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion amongſt vs. For thy great names ſake, and infinite mercies ſake, deale gratiouſly and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourablie with vs, &amp; our poſteritie. Turne from vs that vengeance which is due to vs for our ſins. For thou ſeeſt how iniquitie preuaileth and the wicked goe away with the goale. Atheiſme ouerſpreadeth euery where, and Popery ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to get a head againe. Now therfore (deare Father) we moſt humbly beſeech thee to take order ſpeedily for the remedying &amp; repreſſing of theſe manifold diſorders, and grieuous enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that are amongſt vs. Be intreated of thy poore children to be good to this Engliſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Heare the cries of thine elect: heare the mourning of them that mourne in <hi>Sion.</hi> Let the cries of thy children cry downe all the cries of the ſins of the land, and be reconciled vnto vs in the multitude of thy compaſſions: that ſo thou maieſt ſtill continue a moſt mercifull protector of this thine Engliſh vineyard. Wee pray thee (good Father) ſhew ſpeciall mercy to our moſt Noble and gratious King <hi>Iames</hi> thine annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeruant: bleſſe him, and keepe him in all his waies. Bleſſe his gouernment vnto vs. Let thine Angels encampe about him, and let thy holy hand be alwaies ouer him, keepe him from trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb facs="tcp:13922:210"/>
and deliuer him from the treacheries of his enemies: giue him to ſee what belongeth vnto his peace, and giue him a heart earneſtlybent to ſet vpon the practiſe of the ſame: giue him all graces neceſſary for his peace, and neceſſary for his ſaluation: continue his gouernment peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and proſperous amongſt vs: &amp; as thon haſt made him the breath of our noſtrils, and a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious inſtrument for the ſauing of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſoules, ſo let his owne ſoule be ſaued in the day of thy Son Chriſt. Bleſſe his Maieſties moſt honorable priuy Counſellors, &amp; giue ſuch good ſucceſſe vnto all their Counſels and policies in matters of ſtate, that we may leade a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe &amp; honeſty. Bleſſe all the Nobility, worke in them a care to glorifie thy name in their places, make them faithfull to thee, and faithfull to the Land. Direct with thy good ſpirit all ſuch as beare the ſword of Iuſtice, that they may draw it out to puniſh the wicked, and to defend the godly, and that they may with all good care and conſcience diſcharge the duties of their places. Increaſe the number of faithfull and zealous Miniſters, in this church. Send thy Goſpel to thoſe places where it is not, and bleſſe it where it is. Remember them in thy mercy O Lord, that are vnder any croſſe or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction whatſoeuer: be comfortable vnto them, heale vp their wounds, binde vp their ſores, put all their teares into thy bottle, and make their
<pb facs="tcp:13922:211"/>
bedde in all their ſorrowes, and put ſuch a good ende to all their troubles, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounde to thy glory, and the furtherance of their owne ſaluation. In the meane time giue them patience and conſtancy to beare whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it ſhall pleaſe thy mercifull hand to lay vpon them. Laſt of all, in a word, we pray thee bleſſe magiſtracy, miniſtery, and commonalty. Bleſſe all thy people; doe good to all that are true and vpright in their hearts. And ſo (deare Father) we doe commit and commend our ſelues, our ſoules and bodies into thy hands, for this day, and the reſt of our life, praying thee to take care and charge of vs; keepe vs from all euill, watch ouer vs for our good, let thine Angels encampe about vs, let thy holy hand be ouer vs, &amp; keepe vs in all our waies, that we may liue to thy praiſe and glory heere in earth, keeping faith and a good conſcience in all our actions; that after this life we may be crowned of thee, for euer in thy kingdome. Grant theſe things (good father) to vs here preſent, &amp; to all thine abſent; praying thee in ſpeciall fauor to remember our friends, &amp; kinsfolks in the fleſh, all our good neighbours &amp; welwillers, &amp; all thoſe forwhom we are bound to pray by nature, by deſerts, or any duty what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, for Ieſus Chriſts ſake our onely media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; to whom with thee, and the holy Ghoſt, be giuen all praiſe and glory, both now, and for euermore.</p>

Ariſe therefore O moſt mighty God, and maintaine thine owne cauſe againſt all thine enemies, ſmite through all their loines, and bow downe their backs, yea let them all be confounded, and turned backward that beare ill will vnto <hi>Sion.</hi> Let the patient abiding of the righteous be ioy: and let the wicked be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of their hope.

them as a moſt holy inheritance. Defend vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt forraine inuaſion, kéepe out idolatry, and Popery from amongſt vs. Turne from vs thoſe plagues which our ſinnes crie for. For the ſins of this Land are excéeding great, horrible, and outragious, and giue thée iuſt cauſe to make vs ſpectacles of thy vengeance to all Nations: that by how much the more thou haſt lifted vs vp in great mercy, &amp; long peace, by ſo much the more thou ſhouldeſt preſſe vs downe in great wrath and long war. Therefore deare father, we moſt humbly intreate thée for thy great names ſake, &amp; for thy infinite mercies ſake, that thou wouldeſt be reconciled to this land, and diſcharge it of all the horrible ſinnes thereof. Drowne them O Lord in thy infinite mercy through Chriſt, as it were in a bottomleſſe gulfe, that they may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer riſe vp in iudgement againſt vs. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our ſins be excéeding many, and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet thy mercy is farre greater. For thou art infinite in mercy: but we cannot be infinite in ſinning. Giue vs not ouer into the hands of the Idolaters, left they ſhould blaſpheme thy name and ſay, Where is their God in whom they truſted? But rather, deare Father, take vs into thine owne hands, and correct vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy wiſedome: for with thée is mercy, and déepe compaſſion.

Wée bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee alſo to bleſſe his Maieſties moſt heno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable priuy Counſellors. Counſell them from aboue, let them take aduiſe of thée in all things: that they may both conſult, and reſolue of ſuch courſes as may be moſt for thy glory, the good of the Church, and the peace of this our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. Bleſſe the Nobility, and all the Magiſtrates in the Land, giuing them al grace to execute iudgement and iuſtice, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truth and equity. Bleſſe all the faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpell, increaſe the number of them, increaſe thy gifts in them: and ſo bleſſe al their labours in their ſeueral places and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, that they all may be inſtruments of thy hand to inlarge thy Sonnes kingdome, and to winne many vnto thee. Comfort the comfortleſſe with all néedfull comforts. Forget none of thine that are in trouble: but as their

Giue vs thankefull hearts for all thy mercies, both ſpirituall and corporall: for thou art very mercifull vnto vs in the things of this life, and infinitely more mercifull in the things of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life. Let vs déepely ponder and weigh all thy particular fauours towards vs: that by the due conſideration thereof, our hearts may bée gained yet néerer vnto thée, and that therefore wée may both loue and obey thée, becauſe thou art ſo kinde and louing vnto vs: that euen thy loue towards vs, may draw our loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thée, and that becauſe mercy is with thée, thou maieſt bée feared. Grant theſe things good Father, and all other néedefull graces for our ſoules or bodies, or any of thine throughout the whole world, for Jeſus Chriſts ſake.

            <p>O Lord my God, and heauenly Father, I thy moſt vnworthy childe, doe héere in thy ſight fréely confeſſe that I am a moſt ſinnefull creature, and damnable tranſgreſſor of all thy holy Lawes and Commandements: that as I was borne and bred in finne, and ſtained in the wombe, ſo haue I continually brought foorth the corrupt &amp; vgly fruits of that infection &amp; contagion, wherein I was firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, both in thoughts, words, &amp; works. If I ſhould goe about to reckon vp my particular of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, I know not where to begin, or where to make an end. For they are mo then the haires of my head, yea farre moe then I can poſſibly féele or know. For who knoweth the height, and depth of his corruption: who knoweth how oft he offendeth? Thou onely O Lord knoweſt my ſins, who knoweſt my heart: nothing is hid from thée, thou knoweſt what I haue béene, &amp; what I am: yea my conſcience doth accuſe mée of many &amp; gréeuous euils, and I doe daily féele by woful experience how frail I am, how prone to euill, &amp; how vntoward to all goodneſſe. My minde is ful of vanity, my hartfull of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, mine affections full of deadneſſe, dulneſſe &amp; drowzineſſe in matters of thy worſhip &amp; ſeruice. Yea, my whole ſoule is full of ſpirituall blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:13922:216"/>
hardneſſe, vnprofitablenes, coldneſſe, and ſecurity. And in very déed I am altogether a lumpe of ſin, &amp; a maſſe of all miſery: &amp; therefore I haue forfaited thy fauour, &amp; incurred thy high diſpleaſure, &amp; haue giuen thée iuſt cauſe to frown vpon me, to giue me ouer, &amp; leaue me to mine owne corrupt will and affections. But (O my déere father) I haue learned from thy mouth, that thou art a God full of mercy, flow to wrath &amp; of great compaſſion &amp; kindneſſe, towards all ſuch as grone vnder the burden of their ſinnes. Therefore extend thy great mercy towards me poore ſinner, and giue me a generall pardon for all mine offences whatſoeuer: ſeale it in the bloud of thy ſonne, and ſeale it to my conſcience by thy ſpirit, aſſuring me more and more of thy loue &amp; fauour towards me, &amp; that thou art a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled father vnto me. Grant that I may, in all time to come loue thée much, becauſe much is giuen, and of very loue feare thée, and obey thée. O Lord increaſe my faith, that I may ſtedfaſtly beléeue all the promiſes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel made in thy ſon Chriſt &amp; reſt vpon them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together. Enable me to bring foorth the ſound fruits of faith and repentance in all my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar actions. Fill my ſoule full of ioy and peace in beléeuing. Fill me full of inward comfort and ſpirituall ſtrength againſt all temptatious: giue me yet a greater féeling of thy loue &amp; manifold
<pb facs="tcp:13922:217"/>
mercies towards me, worke in my ſoule a loue of thy Maieſty, a zeale of thy glory, an hatred of euill, and a deſire of all good things. Giue me victory ouer thoſe ſins which thou knoweſt are ſtrongeſt in me. Let me once at laſt make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the world, and the fleſh. Mortifie in me whatſoeuer is carnall, ſanctifie me throughout by thy ſpirit, knit my heart to thée for euer that I may feare thy name, renue in mée the image of thy ſonne Chriſt daily more and more. Giue me a delight in the reading and meditation of thy word. Let me reioyce in the publike mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery thereof. Let me loue and reuerence all the faithfull Miniſters of thy Goſpell. Sanctifie their doctrines to my conſcience, ſeale them in my ſoule, write them in my hart; giue me a ſoft and melting heart, that I may tremble at thy words, and be alwaies much affected with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſermons. Let not my ſinnes hold backe thy mercies from me, nor mine vnworthines ſtop the paſſage of thy grace. Open mine eies to ſée the great wonders of thy law. Reueale thy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets vnto me: be open hearted towards me thy vnworthy ſeruant. Hide nothing from me that may make for thy glory, &amp; the good of my ſoule. Bleſſe all meanes vnto me which thou vſeſt for my good. Bleſſe all holy inſtructions vnto my ſoule. Bleſſe me at all times, both in hearing &amp; reading thy word. Giue me the right vſe of all
<pb facs="tcp:13922:217"/>
thy mercies, and corrections, that I may be the better for them. Let me abound in loue to thy children. Let my heart be very néerely knit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that where thou loueſt moſt, there I may loue moſt alſo. Let me watch &amp; pray, that I enter not into temptation: giue me patience &amp; contentment in all things. Let me loue thée more &amp; more, &amp; the world leſſe &amp; leſſe. So draw my minde vpward, that I may deſpiſe al tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory things. Let me be ſo rapt &amp; rauiſhed with the ſight and féeling of heauenly things, that I may make a baſe rekoning of al earthly things. Let me vſe this world, as though I vſed it not. Let me vſe it but for neceſſity, as meat &amp; drink. Let me not be carried away with the vaine pleaſures and fond delights thereof. Good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worke thy good worke in me, &amp; neuer leaue me, nor forſake me, till thou haſt brought me to true happineſſe. Oh deare Father, make me faithfull in my calling, that I may ſerue thée in it, &amp; be alwaies carefull to doe what good I may in any thing. Bleſſe me in my outward eſtate. Bleſſe my ſoule, body, goods, and name. Bleſſe all that belongeth vnto me. Bleſſe my goings out, &amp; commings in. Let thy countenance be lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp vpon me, now &amp; alwaies: cheare me vp with the ioies &amp; comforts of thy ſpirit: make me thankfull for all thy mercies. For I muſt néeds confeſſe that thou art very kind vnto me in all

things. For in thée I liue mooue &amp; haue my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: of thée I haue my welfare &amp; good being, thou art a daily friend, &amp; ſpeciall good benefactor vnto me. I liue at thy coſt &amp; charges. I hold all of thée in chiefe, and I finde that thou art neuer weary of doing me good: thy goodnes towards me is vnſtanchable. Oh I can neuer be thankefull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough vnto thée for all thy mercies, both ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall &amp; corporall. But in ſuch meaſure as I am able, I praiſe thy name for all, beſéeching thee to accept of my thankeſgiuing, in thy ſon Chriſt, and to giue me a profitable vſe of al thy fauors, that thereby my heart may be fully drawne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thée: giue me O Father to be of ſuch a good nature, and diſpoſition, that I may be wonne by gentleneſſe &amp; faire meanes, as much as if thou gaueſt me many laſhes. Pardon all mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe, vnkindneſſe, and great abuſing of thy mercies, and giue me grace to vſe them more to thy glory in all time to come. Streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then me deare Father thus to continue praiſing &amp; glorifying thy name héere vpon earth: that after this life I may be crowned of thée for euer in thy kingdome. Grant theſe petitions moſt mercifull God, not onely to me, but to all thy déere children throughout the whole world, for Jeſus Chriſt ſake: in whoſe name I doe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther call vpon thée, ſaying as he hath taught me: O our Father which art in Heauen, &amp;c.</p>
