            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

POST-SCRIPT
TO
The late Letter of the
Reconcileableness of God's Presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
&amp;c.</head>
            <p>FInding that this Discourse
of the <hi>Reconcileableness of
God's Prescience of the sins
of Men, with the wisdom and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Counsels, Exhortations,</hi>
&amp;c. hath been mis-understood
and mis-represented; I think it
reqisite to say somewhat briefly
in reference thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48144:3"/>
I wrote it upon the motion of
that honourable Gentleman to
whom it is inscribed; who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
somewhat of that
kind might be of use to render
our Religion less-exceptionable
to some persons of an <hi>enqiring
disposition,</hi> that might perhaps be
too sceptical and pendulous, if
not prejudic't.</p>
            <p>Having finisht it, I thought it
best the Author's Name should
pass under some disguise, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it might, so, better serve
its end. For knowing my Name
could not give the cause an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
I was not willing it
should be in a possibility of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it incur any disadvantage.
And therefore, as I have observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some, in such cases, to make
use only of the <hi>two last Letters,</hi> I
imitated some other, in the choice
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48144:3"/>
of the <hi>penultimate.</hi> But perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Discourse now to fall
under Animadversion, I reckon
it becoming to be no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.</p>
            <p>It was unavoidable to me, if I
would, upon reasonable terms,
apply my self to the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the matter I had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
of shewing the consistency
of God's <hi>Prescience of the sins of
men,</hi> with the <hi>Preventive methods</hi>
we find him to have used against
them, to express somewhat of
my sense of (what I well knew
to have been asserted by divers
Schoolmen) God's <hi>Predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Coucurrence</hi> to the sins of men
also.</p>
            <p>For it had been (any one may
see) very idle, and ludicrous
trifling, to offer at reconciling
those methods with <hi>God's Presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48144:4"/>
and have waved that (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly)
greater difficulty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
them with his <hi>Predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative
concourse,</hi> if I had thought
there had been such a thing. And
were a like case, as if a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
undertaking a wounded
person, should apply himself,
with a great deal of diligence and
address, to the cure of a Finger
slightly scratch't; and totally
neglect a wound (feared to be
mortal) in his Breast.</p>
            <p>And whereas I reckon'd <hi>God's
Prescience</hi> of all whatsoever futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
and, conseqently, of the
sins of men, <hi>most certain,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable
(tho it was not the
business of this Discourse to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
it, but, supposing it,
to shew its reconcileableness
with what it seemed not so well
to agree) if I had believed his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48144:4"/>
               <hi>Predeterminative concurrence</hi> to the
sins of men to be <hi>as certain;</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
despair of being able to say
any thing to purpose <hi>in this case,</hi>
had made me resolve to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>in either.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, to shew how it might
stand with the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of the Blessed God, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
men not to sin, to profess his
hatred and detestation of it, to
remonstrare to men the great
danger they should incur by it;
with so great appearance of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousness
to exhort, warn, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulate
with them concerning it,
express his great displeasure and
grief for their sinning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seqent
miseries; and yet all the
while act them on thereto, by a
secret, but mighty and irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
influence, seem'd to me an
utterly <hi>hopeless</hi> and <hi>impossible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48144:5"/>
The other, without
this (supposing, <hi>as to this,</hi> the
case to have been as some have
thought it) a very <hi>vain one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But being well assured, that
what seem'd the greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to carry most of terrour
and affright in the face of it, was
only a <hi>Chimera.</hi> I reckoned the
other very superable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
directed my Discourse thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
according to the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of it, which was in effect but
to justifie God's making such a
creature as Man, and governing
him agreeably to his Nature.</p>
            <p>Now judging it reqisite, that
he who should read that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
concerning <hi>this designed
Subject,</hi> with any advantage,
should have the same thoughts
<hi>of the other, which was waved,</hi> that
I had; I apprehended it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48144:5"/>
to communicate those
thoughts concerning <hi>that,</hi> as I
did. Not operously, and as my
business, but only on the By,
and as was fit in reference to a
thing that was to be waved, and
not insisted on.</p>
            <p>Now I perceive that some
persons, who had formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
that strange opinion <hi>of
God's Predeterminative concurrence
to the wickedest actions,</hi> and not
purged their minds of it, have
been offended with <hi>that Letter,</hi> for
not expressing more respect unto
it. And yet offered nothing,
themselves (which to me seems
exceeding strange) for the solv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that great difficulty and
encumbrance, which it infers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Religion.</p>
            <p>Nor do I much wonder, that
this opinion of <hi>Predeterminative
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48144:6"/>
concourse, to sinful actions,</hi> should
have some stiff adherents among
our selves. For having been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by certain <hi>Dominicans,</hi>
that were apprehended, in some
things to approach nearer us,
than others of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church;
it came to receive favour and
countenance from some of our
own, of considerable note for
piety and learning, whose Name
and Authority cannot but be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to have much influence,
on the minds of many.</p>
            <p>But I somewhat wonder, that
they who have had no <hi>kindness</hi>
for <hi>this Letter,</hi> upon the account
of its dissent from them, in this
particular, should not allow it
<hi>common justice.</hi> For because it
hath not said every thing they
would have had it say, and that
would have been grateful to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48144:6"/>
themselves, they impute to it
the having said what it said not,
and what they apprehended
would be most ungrateful to all
pious and sober men.</p>
            <p>The sum is, they give out
concerning it, that it denies the
Providence of God about sin,
which all good men ought to
abhor from; and insinuate that
it falls in with the sentiments of
<hi>Durandus,</hi> which they know ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
think not well of.</p>
            <p>All that I intend to do, for the
present, upon this occasion, shall
be to shew wherein <hi>the Letter</hi> is
mis-represented, and charged
with what it hath not in it. To
remark what is said against <hi>that
supposed sense of it,</hi> and give the
<hi>true sense</hi> of what it says touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this matter; with a further
account of the Author's mind
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48144:7"/>
herein, than it was thought fit
to insert into so transient and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional
a Discourse as that part
of <hi>the Letter</hi> was. Whereby it
may be seen, wherein he agrees
with those of that opposite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion,
and what the very <hi>point</hi>
of difference is. Further than
this, I yet intend not to go, till I
see further need.</p>
            <p>There have two Discourses
come to my view that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to that <hi>Letter.</hi> The one
in Manuscript only; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is uncertain to me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the reputed Author of it
will own it or no; and, because
it says little or nothing, by way
of argument, against the <hi>true sense</hi>
of the <hi>Letter,</hi> I shall take no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
present notice of. The
other is <hi>Printed,</hi> and offers at
somewhat of <hi>argument,</hi> which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48144:7"/>
therefore I shall more attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consider.</p>
            <p>It doth <hi>this Letter</hi> an honour,
whereof its Author never had
the least ambition or expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to insert the mention of it
into the close of a very learned,
elaborate Work<note n="†" place="margin">Court of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> part 2. page 522.</note>; with which
it might, yet, easily be imagined,
<hi>its</hi> simplicity, and remoteness
from any pretence to learning,
would so ill agree, that a qarrel
could not but ensue. It is from
one, who having spent a great
part of his time in travelling tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
some Regions of <hi>literature,</hi>
and been peaceable, as far as I
have understood, in his Travels;
it might have been hoped would
have let this Pamphlet alone,
when, for what I can observe,
he finds no fault with it but what
he makes; and is fain to accuse
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48144:8"/>
it of what is no where to be
found in it, lest it should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
            <p>It is an unaccountable pleasure
which men of some humours
take, in depraving what is done
by others, when there is nothing
attempted that doth interfere
with them; nothing that can,
righteously, be understood to
cross any good end, which they
more openly pretend to, nor
the more concealed end (if they
have any such) of their own
glory.</p>
            <p>Common edification seems
less designed, when every thing
must be thrown down, which
is not built by their own hands,
or by their own line and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>I plead nothing of merit in
this little Essay, only I say for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48144:8"/>
it, that I know not what it can
be guilty of towards this <hi>learned
man,</hi> that can have occasioned
this assault upon it by his Pen.
By how much the less it keeps
his road, the more I might have
thought it out of the way of his
notice. I am sure it meant him
no harm, nor had any design to
pilfer from him any part of his
Collections.</p>
            <p>But he says, <hi>he may not let it
pass.</hi> Then there is no remedy.
But I wonder what he should
mean by <hi>he may not.</hi> It must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mean, that <hi>he thought it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi>
to let it pass, or that he
had <hi>a mighty strong and irresistible
inclination</hi> to sqabble a little with
it. The <hi>former</hi> cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
For then, for the same
reason, he would have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sundry others of former and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48144:9"/>
later days, that have said much
to the purpose, which <hi>this Letter</hi>
doth but touch <hi>obiter,</hi> and on the
By; in its way to another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.
But those were Giants,
whom it was not so safe to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with. Therefore he could
very wisely <hi>let them pass,</hi> tho they
have wounded his beloved
Cause, beyond all that it is in
the power of his, (or any) Art
to Cure.</p>
            <p>Whence it is conseqent, that
the whole business must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
<hi>into the latter.</hi> And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
cannot but owe it self
to some peculiar aspect and refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
he had to the Author.
Whom, tho he was <hi>in incognito,</hi>
yet (as I have been informed)
he professes to have discourst
with upon the same Subject ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times. And so, therefore, he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48144:9"/>
might once more before this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
rancounter, if he had thought
sit, and Nature could have been
repel'd a while.</p>
            <p>It is true, he hath found me
not facile to entertain his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in this matter. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I have deeply dreaded the
portentous imaginations which I
found had more lightly tinctur'd
his Mind, as to this thing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Blessed God. Than
which, upon deliberation, I do
believe, no human Wit can ever
devise worse. As I have often
freely told divers of my Friends,
and 'tis very likely, among them,
himself. Tho I do not suspect
the contagion to have infected
his vitals; By a priviledg, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saf't
to some, that they may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
drink some deadly thing
that shall not hurt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48144:10"/>
But why must an impatiency
of this dissent break out into so
vindictive an hostility? I will
not say I expected more friendly
dealing.</p>
            <p>For, as I do well know it was
very possible such a public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
might have been manag'd
with that candour and fairnes, as
not at all to intrench upon friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
So, as it is, I need not own
so much weaknes, as, upon many
years experience, not to be able
to distinguish, and understand
there are some tempers less ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the ingenuities that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to that pleasant relation.</p>
            <p>But it was only a charitable
errour of which I repent not, that
I expected a more righteous
dealing.</p>
            <p>He pretends to give my sense,
in other words. And then grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48144:10"/>
falls to combating his own
man of straw which he will have
represent me, and so I am to be
tortured <hi>in Effigie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[It can never be proved, that it
implies a contradiction, for God to
make a Creature, which should be
capable of acting without immediate
Concourse.]</p>
            <p>This he puts in a different cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
as if I had said so much.</p>
            <p>And why might not my own
words be allowed to speak my
own sense? But that his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and eyes, must then have
conspired to tell him, that the
sense would have been qite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?
It is only a <hi>[predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native]
concurrence to all actions,
even those that are most malignantly
wicked,</hi> p. 32. And again, <hi>Gods
concurring, by a [determinative] in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
unto wicked actions,</hi> p. 36.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48144:11"/>
Which is the only thing I speak
of; as what I cannot reconcile
with the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Sinceritie,</hi> of
his Counsels and Exhortations,
against such actions.</p>
            <p>And if he had designed to serve
any common good end, in this
undertaking of his, why did he
not attempt to reconcile them
himself? But the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie</hi>
of God are thought fit, (as
it would seem) to be sacrificed to
the reputation of his more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
admired Schoolmen. If
there be such an universal deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
by an irresistible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
influence, to all even the
wickedest actions (which God
forbid!) methinks such a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
should not be so easily past
over. And surely the reconciling
such a <hi>determinative influence</hi> with
the <hi>Divine Wisdom and Sinceritie,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48144:11"/>
had been a performance worth
all his learned labours besides,
and of greater service to the
Christian name and honour.</p>
            <p>But it seems the denying <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence</hi>
by such <hi>predetermining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,</hi>
is the denying of <hi>all imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
concurrence.</hi> And I am sent
to the <hi>Thomists, Scotists, Jesuites,</hi>
and <hi>Suarez,</hi> more especially to
be taught otherwise. As if all
these were for <hi>determinative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</hi>
Which is very pleasant,
When the very <hi>Heads</hi> of the two
first-mentioned <hi>Sects</hi> were against
it, as we shall see further anon,
the third <hi>generally,</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
whom he names, have
so industriously and strongly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it. Yea and because I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
not to the Doctrine of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinative
concourse,</hi> I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
(which was the last
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48144:12"/>
spite that was to be done me) as
a favourer of the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of
<hi>Durandus.</hi> And he might, as <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
have said of <hi>Henry Nicholas,</hi>
but not so <hi>prudently,</hi> because he
knowes whose opinions have a
nearer alliance to that Family.</p>
            <p>Now I heartily wish I had a
ground for so much charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, as to suppose him
ignorant that <hi>immediate concourse,</hi>
and <hi>determinative,</hi> are not wont
to be used by the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> in this
controversie, as terms of the
same signification. If he do, <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
think them to be all one,
what warrant is that to him to
give the <hi>same</hi> for <hi>my sense?</hi> When
'tis so well known they are not
<hi>commonly</hi> so taken, and that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminative</hi>
concourse is so volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minously
written against, where
<hi>immediate</hi> is expresly asserted. Let
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48144:12"/>
him but soberly tell me, what
his design was, to dash out the
word <hi>[determining]</hi> from what
he recites Of that <hi>Letter,</hi> and put
in <hi>[immediate].</hi> Which he knowes
is not to be found in any of the
places he refers to in it. Or what
was the spring of that confidence
that made him intimate the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
Thomists,</hi> The <hi>Jesuites,</hi> and
particularly <hi>Suarez,</hi> to be against
what is said in the <hi>Letter,</hi> in this
thing? If he could procure all
the Books in the World to be
burnt, besides those in his own
Library, he would yet have an
hard task to make it be believed
in the next Age, that all these
were for <hi>God's efficacious determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Wills of men unto wicked
actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not, after all this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
my self, as to what he saies
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48144:13"/>
about the <hi>No Medium</hi> between
the extreams of his disjunctive
proposition. <hi>Either the human will
must depend upon the Divine indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Will of God,</hi> &amp;c. (as he phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it in the excess of his caution,
lest any should think the <hi>Will of
God</hi> was not a <hi>Divine Will) Or God
must depend on the human will,</hi> &amp;c.
Unles he can shew that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
will cannot be said to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the Divine, <hi>as being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
by it,</hi> except it be also <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi>
and <hi>impelled</hi> by it, to every
wicked action. A created Being
that was entirely from God, with
all the powers and faculties
which belong to it; That hath
its continual subsistence in him,
and all those powers continued,
and maintained by his influence
every moment; That hath those
powers made habile, and apt for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48144:13"/>
whatsoever its most natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and operations, by a sutable
influence, whensoever it moves
or operates. Can this creature
be said <hi>not to depend,</hi> as to <hi>all its
motions and operations,</hi> unles it be
also unavoidably <hi>impelled</hi> to do
every thing to which it is thus
sufficiently <hi>enabled?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I again say, Was it impossible
to God to make such a creature
that can, in this case, <hi>act or not
act?</hi> It is here odly enough said,
<hi>that the Author gives no demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hereof.</hi> Of what? <hi>Why that it
can never be proved</hi> (as the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the foregoing word
shewes) <hi>that it implies a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
&amp;c. It seems it was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Authour should have <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
by demonstration, <hi>that it can
never be proved, that it implies a
contradiction, for God to make a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48144:14"/>
which should be capable of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
(as he feigns him to have said)
<hi>without immediate concourse.</hi> By
what rule of reasoning was he
obliged to do so? But if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
there is such a creature, as,
in the case before expressed, can
act without <hi>determinative concourse,</hi>
will serve turn to prove, that it
cannot be proved, it implies a
contradiction there should be
such a One: I may think the
thing was done. And may think
it sufficiently proved, that there
is such a creature; If it appear
(whereof there is too much
proof) that there are such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
done by creatures, as, for the
reasons that were before alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it could not stand with the
Nature of God to determine them
unto.</p>
            <p>And was nothing said tending
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48144:14"/>
to prove this, that it could not
consist with the Nature of God,
to determine men unto all the
wicked actions they commit?
It seems unles it were put into
mood and figure, 'tis no proof.
Nor was it the design of those
Papers to <hi>insist</hi> upon that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
but there are things sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
<hi>in transitu,</hi> as such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
could admit, that (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are demonstrative or
no) would puzzle a considering
person. <hi>That God should have as
much influence, and concurrence to the
worst actions, as to the best. As much,
or more than the sinner or the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
That the matter of his Lawes
to Adam, and his posterity, should be
a natural impossibilitie.</hi> And I now
add, the <hi>irreconcileablenes of that
determination, with God's Wisdom
and Sinceritie,</hi> &amp;c. These I shall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48144:15"/>
reckon demonstrations, till I see
them well answered.</p>
            <p>However if mine were a bad
opinion, why was it not as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futable
without the mention of
<hi>Durandus?</hi> But that was, with
him, an odious name; and fit,
therefore, to impress the brand,
which he desired I should wear
for his sake. This is a likely way
to clear the truth. Yet if it serve
not one design, it will another,
he thinks, upon which he was
more intent.</p>
            <p>Are all for <hi>Durandus</hi>'s way
that are against a <hi>predeterminative
influence</hi> to wicked actions? I
could tell him who have shewn
more strength in arguing against
<hi>Durandus,</hi> than I find in all his
Arguments; who yet have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
too, against <hi>determinative</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<hi>to such actions,</hi> more than
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48144:15"/>
ever he will be able to answer, or
any man.</p>
            <p>The truth is, when I wrote
that <hi>Letter,</hi> I had never seen <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus.</hi>
Nor indeed did I consult
any Book for the writing of it,
(as I had not opportunity, if I
had been so inclined) except, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some occasions, the Bible.
Not apprehending it necessary,
to number votes, and consider
how many mens thoughts were
one way, and of how many the
other, before I would adventure
to think any of my own: But,
I have this day, upon the view
of his Animadversions, taken a
view of <hi>Durandus</hi> too. And, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
cannot yet guess, what
should tempt him to parallel my
conceptions with <hi>Durandus</hi>'s, but
that he took <hi>his,</hi> for somewhat
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48144:16"/>
an ill-favoured name.<note place="margin">L. 2. Dist. 1. Q. 5. D. 37. Q. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
flatly, in several places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
God's <hi>immediate concourse</hi> to
the actions of the Creatures.
Which I never said nor thought.
But do really believe his <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi>
concourse, to all actions of
his Creatures (both <hi>immediatione
virtutis,</hi> and <hi>suppositi,</hi> that I may
more comply with his Scholastic
humour, in the use of such terms,
than gratifie my own) Yet not
<hi>determinative unto wicked actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Durandus</hi> denies <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
concourse,</hi> universally, and
upon such a ground, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
the denial must eqally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to <hi>good</hi> actions as to <hi>bad;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dist. 1. Q. 5. ut supr.</note>
viz. <hi>That 'tis impossible the same
numerical action should be from two
or more Agents immediately and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
except the same numerical
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48144:16"/>
vertue should be in each. But</hi> (he
saies) <hi>the same numerical vertue
cannot be in God and in the Creature,</hi>
&amp;c. Whereas he well knowes
the <hi>concourse</hi> or <hi>influence</hi> (for I
<hi>here</hi> affect not the curiosity to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
these two termes, as
some do) which I deny not to
be <hi>immediate</hi> to <hi>any actions,</hi> I only
deny to be <hi>determinative,</hi> as <hi>to
those which</hi> are wicked.</p>
            <p>Yea and the Authours he qotes
(§. 11.) <hi>Aqinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> tho
every body may know they are
against what was the notion of
<hi>Durandus,</hi> yet are as much against
<hi>himself,</hi> if he will directly oppose
that <hi>Letter,</hi> and assert determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
concourse to wicked actions.
They held <hi>immediate concourse,</hi> not
<hi>determinative. The former,</hi> tho he
supposes <hi>Divine help</hi> in reference
to the elections of the human
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48144:17"/>
will, yet asserts the elections
themselves to <hi>be in mans own power,</hi>
and only saies that <hi>in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of those elections men can be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</hi>
That (whatsoever influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
he asserts of the first cause)
men still,<note place="margin">1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. Q. 83.</note> 
               <hi>habent se indifferentèr ad
benè vel malè eligendum. The other,</hi>
tho he also excludes not the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi>
efficiency of God in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the actions of men, yet
is so far from making it <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native,</hi>
that the reason he gives
why, in evil actions, man sins,
and God doth not, is, that the
former of these Causes, <hi>posset re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitudinem
dare actui qam tenetur
eam dare, tamen, qantum est ex se,
daret, si voluntas creata cooperare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi>
in the very place which
himself refers to. Wherein they
differ from <hi>this Authour toto Coelo;</hi>
and <hi>from me,</hi> in that they make
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48144:17"/>
not determinative influence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in reference to good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which I expresly do.</p>
            <p>Thus far it may be seen what
pretence or colour he had to
make <hi>my Opinion</hi> the same with
<hi>Durandus</hi>'s, or, his own, the same
with that of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if he knew in what esteem
I have <hi>the Schoolmen,</hi> he would
hardly believe me likely to step
one foot out of my way, either
to gain the reputation of any of
their names, or avoid the disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
            <p>He, notwithstanding, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his own reputation to be so
good (and I know no reason why
he might not suppose so) as to
make it be believed I was any
thing he pleased to call me, by
such as had not opportunity to
be otherwise informed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48144:18"/>
And thus I would take leave
of him, And permit him to use
his own reflections upon his usage
of me, at his own leisure. But
that civility bids me (since he is
pleased to be at the pains of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techising
me) first to give some
answer to the Qestions wherein
he thus expostulates with me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Q. 1.</note> Whether there be any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Man on earth so good, which
hath not some mixture of Sin in it?
And if God concur to the substrate
matter of it as good, must he not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
concur to the substrate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as sinful? For is not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
matter of the act, both as good
and sinful the same?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">A. 1.</note> It seems then, that God
doth concur to the matter of an
action <hi>as sinful.</hi> Which is honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acknowledged, since by his
Principles, it cannot be denied;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48144:18"/>
tho most, of his way, mince the
business, and say the concurrence
is only to the action <hi>which is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
not <hi>as sinful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This I am to consider as an
argument for God's <hi>predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native
concurrence</hi> to wicked acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And thus it must be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
That if God concur by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminative
influence</hi> to the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
good actions of <hi>Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
Love</hi> to himself, <hi>Prayer:</hi>
Therefore to the acts of enmity
against himself, <hi>Cursing, Idolatry,
Blasshemy,</hi> &amp;c. And is it not a
mighty conseqence? If to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are good <hi>qoad substantiam,</hi>
therefore to such as are in the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
of them evil? We our selves
can, in a remoter kind, concur to
the actions of others: Because <hi>you</hi>
may afford, <hi>your self,</hi> your <hi>leading
concurrence</hi> to actions imperfectly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48144:19"/>
good, therefore may you to them
that are down-right evil? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
to Praier, therefore to <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
and <hi>Swearing?</hi> and then ruin
men for the actions you induc't
them to? You'l say God may
rather, but sure he can much less
do so than you. How could you
be serious in the Proposal of this
qestion?</p>
            <p>We are at a loss how it should
consist with the Divine Wisdom,
Justice, Goodnes, and Truth to
design the punishing Man, yet
innocent, with everlasting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for actions which God,
himself, would irresistibly move
him to; Whereas his making a
Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> in reference
to himself and his posterity, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
there was a possibility it
might be kept; at least that he
would not make the keeping of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48144:19"/>
it, by his own positive influence,
impossible. And you say, <hi>If he
might concur to the substrate matter
of an action as good,</hi> (which tends
to man's Salvation and Blessed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ness)
he must necessarily conc<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               <hi>(and that by an irresistible determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native

all their evil actions, <hi>as evil,</hi> which
tend to their ruine and misery,
brought upon them by the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which God makes them do.
I suppose S. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 9. with <hi>Hos.

therefore ask me, Why I should
not admit this conseqence? I say
it needs no other answer, than
that I take Wisdom, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,

You might better argue thence
the necessity of his producing,

to his own Nature, and stain the

I should least of all, ever have
expected such a qestion to this
purpose, and am ashamed further
to answer it. Only name any
act of Providence, I hereby deny,
if you can.</p>
            <p>In the next place, That my
sense may appear, in my own
words; And that I may shew
<hi>how far</hi> I am of the same mind
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48144:21"/>
with those that apprehend me at
so vast a distance from them;
and where, if they go further,
our <hi>parting point</hi> must be; I shall
set down the particulars of my
agreement with them, and do
it in no other heads than they
might have collected, if they
had pleased, out of that <hi>Letter,</hi>
As</p>
            <p>1. That God exerciseth an
universal Providence about all
his Creatures, both in sustaining
and governing them.</p>
            <p>2. That, more particularly, he
exerciseth such a Providence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Man.</p>
            <p>3. That this Providence about
Man extends to all the actions of
all men.</p>
            <p>4. That it consists not alone
<hi>in beholding</hi> the actions of men,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48144:21"/>
as if he were a meer spectatour
of them only, but is positively
active about them.</p>
            <p>5. That this active Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God about all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
of men consists not meerly
in giving them the natural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
whereby they can work <hi>of
themselves,</hi> but in a real influence
upon those powers.</p>
            <p>6. That this influence is in
reference to holy and spiritual
actions (whereto since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacie,
the nature of Man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
viciously dis-inclined) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be <hi>efficaciously determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native;</hi>
such as shall overcome
that dis-inclination, and reduce
those powers into act.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:48144:22"/>
7. That the <hi>Ordinary, appointed</hi>
way for the communication of
this <hi>determinative influence,</hi> is by
our intervening consideration of
the inducements which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
to us in his Word, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Precepts, Promises, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
which are the moral
instruments of his Government.
No doubt but he may (as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
in <hi>the Letter, p. 141.)</hi>
extraordinarily act Men, in some
rarer cases, by inward impulse,
without the help of such exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
means, (as he did Prophets
or inspired persons) And when
he hath done so, we were not to
think he treated them unagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to their natures, Or so as
their natures could not, without
violence, admit. But it hath
been the care and designment of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48144:22"/>
the Divine Wisdom, so to order
the way of dispensation towards
the several sorts of Creatures, as
not only not, ordinarily, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon them, what they could
not conveniently be <hi>patient</hi> of,
but so as that their powers and
faculties might be put upon the
<hi>exercises</hi> whereof they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
and to provide that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their <hi>passive</hi> capacity should
be overcharged, nor their <hi>active</hi>
be unemployed.</p>
            <p>And whereas the reasonable
nature of Man renders him not
only susceptible of unexpected <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
impressions,</hi> but also capable
of being Governed <hi>by Laws,</hi> which
reqires the use of his own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to understand &amp; obey them;
And whereas we also find such
Lawes are <hi>actually made</hi> for him,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48144:23"/>
and propounded to him with
their proper enforcements. If it
should be the fixed course of
God's Government over him,
only to guide him by inward
impulses, This (as is said, <hi>p. 142)</hi>
would render those Lawes and
their Sanctions impertinencies,
His faculties whereby he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Moral Government <hi>so
far,</hi> and <hi>to this purpose,</hi> useless and
vain. And would be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which the depraved Nature
of Men, would be very apt to
abuse into a temptation to them,
never to bend their powers to
the endeavour of doing any thing
that were of an holy and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
tendency (from which
their aversion would be alwaies
prompting them to devise excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
more than a meer machine
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48144:23"/>
would apply it self to the uses
which it was made for, and doth
not understand.</p>
            <p>Therefore, lest any should be so
unreasonable, as to expect God
should only surprize them, while
they resolvedly sit still and sleep;
he hath, in his infinite Wisdom,
withheld from them the occasion
hereof; And left them destitute
of any encouragement (whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his extraordinary dealings
may have been with some) to
expect his influences, in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of his <hi>Ordinary Methods,</hi> as is
discoursed <hi>p.</hi> 90. and at large in
the following Pages. And which
is the plain sense of that admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12, 13. Yea and
tho there be never so many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of merciful surprisals, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48144:24"/>
of all our own conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and care, Yet <hi>those</hi> are
still to be accounted the <hi>Ordinary
Methods</hi> which are so <hi>de jure,</hi>
which would <hi>actually</hi> be so, if
Men did their duty, and which
God hath obliged us to observe
and attend unto <hi>as such.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. That in reference to all
other actions which are not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
tho there be not a sinful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclination
to them, yet because
there may be a sluggishnes, and
ineptitude to some purposes God
intends to serve by them, This
influence is also alwaies <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native</hi>
thereunto; whensoever to
the immense Wisdom of God
shall seem meet, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to his own great and holy
ends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48144:24"/>
9. That, in reference to <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
actions;</hi> by this influence God
doth not only sustain men who
do them, and continue to them
their natural faculties and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
whereby they are done, but
also, <hi>as the first Mover,</hi> so far
excite and actuate those powers,
as that they are apt and habile
for any congenerous action, to
which they have a natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation;
and whereto they are
not sinfully dis-inclined.</p>
            <p>10. That, if men do then
employ them to the doing of
any sinful action; by that same
influence, he doth, as to him
seems meet, limit, moderate,
and, against the inclination and
design of the sinful Agent, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
and dispose it to good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48144:25"/>
But now, if, besides all this,
they will also assert; That <hi>God
doth, by an efficacious influence, move
and determine men to wicked acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
This is that which I most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvedly
deny.</p>
            <p>That is, in this I shall differ
with them, that I do not suppose
God to have, by internal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as far, an hand, in the
worst and wickedest actions, as
in the best.</p>
            <p>I assert more to be necessary
to actions, to which men are
wickedly dis-inclin'd; but that
less will suffice for their doing of
actions, to which they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
more than enough. I
reckon it sufficient to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of this latter sort of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that their powers be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48144:25"/>
habile, and apt for any such
action, in the general, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
to them; supposing there
be not a peccant aversion, as
there is to all those actions that
are Holy and Spiritual; which
eversion a more potent (<hi>even a
determinative) influence</hi> is necessary
to overcome. I explain my self
by instance.</p>
            <p>A man hath from God the
powers belonging to his nature,
by which he is capable of loving
or hating an apprehended good
or evil. These powers, being,
by a present Divine influence,
rendred habile, and apt for acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
He can now love a good
name, health, ease, life, and
hate disgrace, sicknes, pain, death.
But he doth also by these pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
thus habilitated for action,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48144:26"/>
love wickednes, and hate God.
I say, now, that <hi>to those former
acts</hi> God should over and besides
determine him, is not absolutely
and alwaies necessary; and, <hi>to
the latter,</hi> is impossible. But
that, to hate wickednes <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally,
and as such,</hi> and to love
God, the depravednes of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by the Apostacie, hath
made the <hi>determinative influence</hi>
of efficacious grace necessary.
Which, therefore, he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable
obligation (nor is
destitute of encouragement)
earnestly to implore and pray
for.</p>
            <p>My meaning is now plain to
such as have a mind to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it.</p>
            <p>Having thus given an account
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48144:26"/>
wherein I agree with them, And
wherein, if they please, I must
differ. It may perhaps be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
I should add further Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of that difference on my
part. But I shall for the present
forbear to do it.</p>
            <p>I know it may be alledged,
that some very Pious (as well as
Learned) Men have been of their
opinion. And I seriously believe
it. But that signifies nothing
to the goodnes of the opinion.
Nor doth the badnes of it extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
my <hi>Charity,</hi> nor <hi>reverence</hi>
towards the men. For I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that as many hold the most
important truths, and which
most directly tend to impress the
Image of God upon their Soules,
that yet are never stamped with
any such impression thereby; so,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48144:27"/>
it is not impossible some may
have held very dangerous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
with a notional judgment,
the pernicious influence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hath never distilled upon their
hearts.</p>
            <p>Neither shall I be willing
without necessity to detect other
mens infirmities. Yet if I find
my self any way obliged further
to intermeddle in this matter, I
reckon the time I have to spend
in this World, can never be spent
to better purpose, than in disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the fearful conseqences of
that rejected opinion, the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the subterfuges whereby its
assertours think to hide the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
of it; and the inefficacie
of the Arguments brought for
it.</p>
            <p>Especially those two which
the <hi>Letter</hi> takes notice of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48144:27"/>
For as so ill-coloured an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ought never to be admitted
without the most apparent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
So do I think it most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
there is no necessity it
should be admitted upon those
grounds or any other. And doubt
not but that both the Governing
Providence of God in reference
to all events whatsoever; and
his most certain foreknowledg
of them all, may be defended,
against all opposers, without it.</p>
            <p>But I had rather my prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to these purposes, should
be buried in dust and silence;
than I should ever see the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which should carry the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
with it of their being
at all needful.</p>
            <p>And I shall take it for a just
and most deplorable occasion, if
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48144:28"/>
I shall find any to assert against
me the contradictory to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</p>
            <p>That God doth not by an
Efficacious Influence Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
move and determine men
to all their Actions; even
those that are most wicked.</p>
            <p>Which is the only <hi>true,</hi> and
<hi>plain</hi> meaning, of what was said,
about this busines, in the before
mentioned <hi>Letter.</hi>
