         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I am not now at leiſure. Oh doe not let Chriſt
ſtand <hi>knocking at thy heart, who will come and

<pb facs="tcp:117791:4"/>
becauſe hee is deſirous that all thoſe for whom
it is provided ſhould come to it, (which onely
they doe that believe) he takes away the vaile of
ignorance and unbeliefe from off their hearts:
and here you ſhall finde this skilfull Preacher
hath excellently diſcourſed, what this vaile is,
how it naturally lyes upon all, and is onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved

hath <hi>deſtroyed this covering from off thy heart,</hi> we

condemnes the ranting jollity of ſome looſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
in theſe times.) But here, Chriſt ſerves
<pb facs="tcp:117791:4"/>
in Deaths head, (as <hi>David the head of Goliah)</hi>
the head of a ſlaine and conquered death. Our
<hi>Sampſon</hi> by his owne death <hi>hath deſtroied Death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 13. 14.</note>
               <hi>and hath thereby ranſomed us from the hand of the
grave, and hath redeemed us from Death,</hi> and the
ſlaviſh feare of it: All which is at large handled
in theſe following Sermons for thy comfort and
joy, that thou maiſt triumph in his love through
whom thou art more than Conqueror.</p>
            <p>4. Becauſe <hi>it is a merry heart that makes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
feaſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. Of the Chriſtians teares, and the wiping them away.</note> and that this feaſt might be a Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-day
indeed unto thy ſoule, Chriſt doth here
promiſe, <hi>to wipe away all tears from off the faces of
his people.</hi> The Goſpel hath comforts enough <hi>to
make glad the hearts</hi> of the Saints and people of
God: the <hi>light of Gods countenance</hi> will refreſh
them with <hi>joy unſpeakable, and glorious in the
midſt of the valley of the ſhadow of death.</hi> A
truely godly perſon can weep for his ſinnes,
though the world ſmile never ſo much upon
him; and though hee be never ſo much afflicted
in the world, yet hee can and will <hi>rejoyce</hi> in the
God of <hi>his ſalvation.</hi> In theſe Sermons thou haſt
this Goſpel-promiſe ſweetly opened and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
wherein thou ſhalt finde directions when,
and for what to mourne and weep, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe
of all true mourners, <hi>whoſe ſorrow ſhall
be turned into joy.</hi>

            <p>5. In theſe Sermons you ſhall further finde,<note place="margin">5. Of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Gods people, and the taking of them away.</note>
that though Jeſus Chriſt reſpect his people
highly, and entertaine them bountifully, yet
they have but courſe uſage in the world, who
<pb facs="tcp:117791:5"/>
are wont to revile them as <hi>fooles</hi> and <hi>madmen,</hi> as
<hi>ſeditious Rebels, troublers of Iſrael, proud and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall
perſons.</hi> But bleſſed are they that doe
not <hi>ſtumble at this ſtone of offence,</hi> that weare the
<hi>reproaches of Chriſt as their Crowne, and by well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men:</hi> for
let the world load them with all their revilings,
yet <hi>the ſpirit of glory reſts upon them,</hi> and in due
time he will <hi>rowle away their reproach, and bring
forth their judgement as the light, and their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
as the noon-day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. And becauſe a Chriſtian here hath more
in hope than in hand,<note place="margin">6. Of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</note> more in reverſion than in
poſſeſſion, <hi>walkes by faith rather than ſenſe, and
lives by the Word of God, and not by bread alone,</hi>
Thou ſhalt have here (Chriſtian Reader) a ſweet
Diſcourſe of the <hi>precious promiſes</hi> of Chriſt
which hee hath left us here to ſtay the ſtomack
of the ſoule, till wee come to that feaſt of feaſts
in heaven; that by this glimpſe, wee might in
part know the <hi>greatneſſe of that glory which ſhall
be revealed,</hi> that the firſt fruits might be a pawne
of the Harveſt, and the <hi>earneſt of the Spirit</hi> a
pledge of that full reward wee ſhall have in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
where we ſhall be brim-full of thoſe <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
that are at Gods right hand for ever.</hi> Chriſt
hath given us promiſes to uphold our faith and
hope, till faith be perfected in fruition, and hope
end in viſion, till Jeſus Chriſt, who is here the
<hi>object</hi> of our faith,<note place="margin">7. Of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, and the divine Authority of them.</note> be the <hi>reward</hi> of our faith for

<pb facs="tcp:117791:5"/>
is grounded in the <hi>faithfulneſſe of him that

            <p>Thus we have given you a ſhort proſpect of

nothing of the Author, his former labours
<hi>ſufficiently ſpeak for him in the gates,</hi> his memory

He that enjoyes the glory of heaven, needs not

be truely his, whoſe Name they beare, let him
but obſerve the ſtile, and the excellent and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

Eare-witneſſes yet living, who can cleare them
from any ſhadow of impoſture. They come
forth without any Alteration, ſave onely ſome
repetitions (which the Pulpit did well beare)
are here omitted.</p>
            <p>The Lord make theſe, and all other the labors

the Lord ſo <hi>deſtroy the vaile</hi> from off thy heart,

            <epigraph>

               <q>In this Mountaine ſhall the Lord of Hoſts make unto all
people a Feast of fat things, a Feaſt of Wines on the
Lees, of fat things full of Marrow, of Wine on the Lees

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former Chapter the holy Prophet
having ſpoken of the miſeries,<note place="margin">The connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Text.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
of the Church, in many heavy,
ſad, and dolefull expreſſions; as <hi>the
Vine languiſheth, the earth is defiled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Inhabitants thereof, becauſe they
have tranſgreſſed the Lawes, changed the Ordinance, and
broken the everlaſting Covenant, therefore the earth ſhall
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117791:10"/>
be accurſed, and they that dwell therein ſhall not drink Wine
with a Song, &amp;c.</hi> Here you ſee all ſweetneſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
of heart is departed from them; yet even in the
middeſt of all theſe miſeries, God (the God of comforts)
makes ſweet and gracious promiſes to his Church, to
raiſe it out of its mournfull eſtate and condition. And
therefore the Prophet in the former part of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſpeakes of bleſſing God for the deſtruction of his
Enemies, and for his great love to his Church. And when
he had ſpoken of the ruine of the enemie, hee preſently
breaks out with Thankſgiving, breathing forth abundant
praiſes to his God; as it is the cuſtome of holy men (gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the motion of the bleſſed Spirit of God, upon all
occaſions) (but eſpecially for benefits to his Church) to
praiſe his Name, not out of ill affection at the deſtruction
of the Adverſaries, but at the execution of Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
for the fulfilling of the truth of his promiſe; as in
the firſt Verſe of this Chapter; <hi>O Lord, thou art my God,
I will exalt thee, I will praiſe thy name, for thou haſt done
wonderfull things, thy Counſels of old are faithfulneſſe,
and truth.</hi> When the things that were promiſed of old
were brought to paſſe, the Church was ever ready to give
God the glory of his Truth. Therefore rejoyce not when
thine enemies fall; but when the enemies of the Lord
are brought to deſolation, then we may, nay, we ought
to ſing <hi>Hallelujah</hi> to him that liveth for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>I will now fall upon the very words of my Text. <hi>In
this mountaine ſhall the Lord of Hoſts make unto all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
a Feaſt of fat things, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe words they are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall,
and cannot have a perfect performance all at
once; but they ſhall be performed gradually. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of a new heaven and a new earth ſhall be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
The converſion of the Jewes, and the bringing in
of the fulneſſe of the Gentiles ſhall gradually be brought
to paſſe. All the Promiſes that ever God hath made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſecond comming of Chriſt to Judgement, ſhall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117791:10"/>
be accompliſhed. God hath made his peace with us in
the Goſpell of peace, and when all theſe Promiſes ſhall
be fulfilled, then all imperfection ſhall be done away, and
wee ſhall never be removed from our Rock, but our joy
ſhall then be full; nay even in this life we have ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of perfection, we have grace, and the meanes of
grace, the Ordinances of Chriſt, and a teſtimony of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
glory.</p>
            <q>In this Mountaine will the Lord of Hoſts make a
Feaſt.</q>
            <p>In theſe words yee have ſet downe a glorious and
royall Feaſt; and the place where this Feaſt is to be kept
is Mount <hi>Syon;</hi> the Feaſt-maker is the Lord of Hoſts; the
parties invited are all people; the iſſues of it, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for the Feaſt, are fat things, and wine of the beſt;
a Feaſt of the beſt of the beſt; a Feaſt of the fat, and of
the Marrow, a Feaſt of wine on the Lees well refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>Here you may ſee that God doth veile heavenly things
under earthly things, and condiſcends ſo low as to enter
into the inward man by the outward man; for our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
are ſo weak, and narrow, that we cannot bee
acquainted with ſpirituall things, but by the inward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Spirit of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>This <hi>mountaine</hi> is the place where this Feaſt is made,
even <hi>Mount Syon,</hi> which is a type and figure of the
Church, called in Scripture, <hi>the holy Mountaine;</hi> for as
Mountains are raiſed high above the earth, ſo the Church
of God is raiſed in excellency and dignity above all the
ſorts of man-kinde;<note place="margin">1 Obſerv.</note> 
               <hi>As much as men above Beaſts, ſo
much is the Church raiſed above all men.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Church the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all ſocieties.</note> This <hi>Mountain</hi>

all other Mountaines whatſoever; <hi>Thou O Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ſhalt ſtand immoveable,</hi> when all other Mountaines
ſhall ſmoak, if they are but touched; this is the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117791:11"/>
of Mountaines: The Church of God is moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in glory and dignity, as ye may ſee in the latter end
of the former Chapter, how the glory of the Church
puts down all other glories whatſoever; <hi>The Moon,</hi> ſaith
the Prophet, <hi>ſhall be confounded, and the Sunne aſhamed
when the Lord of Hoſts ſhall reigne in Mount Sion, and
in Jeruſalem, and before his Ancients gloriouſly:</hi> So
that the brightneſſe of the Church ſhall put downe the
glory of the Sunne and of the Moon. Thus you ſee the
Church of God is a Mountaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Becauſe God hath eſtabliſhed it upon a

               <note place="margin">The Church built upon the ſtrongeſt foundation.</note> It is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the goodneſſe, and power, and truth of God.
Mountaines of Braſſe and Iron are not ſo firme as this
Mountaine; For what ſuſtains the Church but the Word
of God? And being built upon his Word and Truth, it
may very well be called a Mountaine, for it ſhall bee as
Mount <hi>Syon,</hi> which ſhall never be removed; it may be
moved, but never removed. Thus in regard of the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and ſtability thereof, it may rightly bee termed a
Mountain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Obſ. Of the viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Church.</note> 
               <hi>we may here ſpeak in ſome ſort of the viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Church;</hi> but here will ariſe a quarrell for the
Papiſts, who when they hear of this Mount, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently allude it to their Church. Their Church, ſay they,
is a Mount, ſo ſaith the Scripture. I anſwer. 1. Wee
confeſſe in ſome ſort their Church to be a Mount (though
not this Mount) for <hi>Babylon</hi> is built on ſeven Hills; but
if this prove her a Church, it is the Antichriſtian Church.
Secondly, That the Catholick Proteſtantiall Church had
alwayes a being, though ſometimes inviſible. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> exhorts them, <hi>not to bee
high-minded, but feare,</hi> for ſaith hee, <hi>if God hath broken
off the naturall branches, perhaps he will break off you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi>
And indeed for their pride and haughtineſſe of minde
they are at this day broken off. Chriſt that walks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ſeven golden Candleſticks, did never ſay
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117791:11"/>
that the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> or <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſhould alwaies
remaine a viſible Church to the eyes of the world, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were they; for to this very day, they lie under
bondage and ſlavery to the Turke. The <hi>Mount</hi> hath bin
alwaies viſible, though not alwaies alike gloriouſly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
for there will be a time when the Church ſhall
fly into the wilderneſſe, where then ſhall be the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
viſibility of the Church? there is a time when all
ſhall follow the beaſt; the Papiſts themſelves confeſſe
that in Antichriſts time the Church ſhall ſcarce be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
The eſſence of a thing, and the quality of a thing
may differ: The Church is a Church, and viſible, but
not alwaies equally, and alike gloriouſly viſible; yet
thoſe that had ſpirituall eyes, and did looke upon things
with the ſpectacles of the Scripture, they could alwaies
declare the Church was viſible; for from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the world the Church had alwaies luſtre enough
ſufficient to delight, and draw the elect, and ſo ſhall
have to the end of the world, though ſometimes the
Church may have a miſt before it, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeakes;
<hi>It is no wonder that thou canſt not ſee a mountaine, for
thou haſt no eyes.</hi> But the Papiſts have ſeen this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;
as they have alwaies bin bloody perſecutors of the
Church, they have ſeen enough to confound them: For
we have nothing in our Church, but they have the ſame;
onely ours is refined, and freed from Idolatry; Wee
have two Sacraments, they have ſeven; Wee have
Scripture, they have traditions, which they equall with
it; Wee have Scriptures pure, they corrupt. So that
our Church was in the midſt of theirs, as a ſound and
more uncorrupt part in a corrupt body.</p>

Mountaine they are Chriſts. <hi>And in this Mountaine
ſhall the Lord of hoſts make a feaſt for all people.</hi> And this
feaſt is a royall feaſt, a marriage feaſt, wherin the joy
and comfort of Gods people are ſet down by that which
is moſt comfortable among men.<note place="margin">The Lord of Hoaſts the founder of the Feaſt.</note> The founder of the
feaſt is the Lord of hoaſts; It is onely he that is able to
prepare a table in the wilderneſſe, that is mighty, and
of ability to feaſt his Church with a ſpirituall, and holy
banquet. We all live at his table for the feeding of our
bodies, but much more in regard of our ſoules; He
can make a feaſt for the whole man, for he is Lord of
the conſcience: and he is to ſpread a table for the whole
world; nay more, (if there were ſo many) he can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
a table for ten thouſand worlds; he is the God of
all ſpirituall comforts, and the God of all conſolation;
He is infinite, and can never be drawne dry, for he is
the fountaine of eternall life. All graces and comforts
in the Scripture are called the comforts and graces of the
holy Spirit, becauſe God is the giver of them by his
Spirit. Who can take away the wound of a guilty
conſcience, but he that hath ſet the conſcience in the
hearts of men? Hee (if hee pleaſeth) can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the burden of a grieved conſcience, and ſupply it,
inſtead thereof, with new and ſolid comforts. He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all the windings and turnings of the ſoule, where
all the paine and griefe lieth, and he cannot but know
it becauſe he onely is above the ſoule: He is therefore
the fitteſt to make the ſoule a feaſt, he only can do it, and
he will do it.</p>
            <q>In this Mountaine ſhall the Lord of Hoaſts make
a feaſt.</q>
            <p>Why is he called the Lord of Hoaſts?</p>
            <p>It is an uſuall terme, to ſet forth the glory of God, to

            <q>He ſhall make a feaſt for all people.</q>
            <p>Thoſe that are invited to this glorious feaſt,<note place="margin">This Feaſt is for all people.</note> are all
people, none excepted, none excluded, that will come
in to Chriſt; ſome of all ſorts, of all nations, of all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages;
this hath relation to the time of the Goſpel.
The Church at firſt had its being in particular families,
but afterwards more inlarged. The Church at the firſt
was of the daughters of men, and the ſonnes of God;
the children of the Church mingled with a generation
of corrupt perſons, that would keepe in no bounds; but
after <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, there was another generation of
the Church, that ſo it was a little more inlarged. Then
there was a third generation, a divided generation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of Jewes, and Gentiles; So that when Chriſt
came into the world, the bounds of the Church began to
inlarge themſelves more and more; ſo that now it is
in this happy condition, <hi>Come ye all unto me, all that are
heavy laden;</hi> both Jewes and Gentiles, all are invited
whoſoever they are, <hi>nothing is now uncleane. Act.</hi> 10.
15. Chriſt is come, and hath made to all people a feaſt
of fat things, it muſt be a feaſt, and of fat things, for all
the world ſhall be the better for it. The Jewes ſhall be
converted, and the fullneſſe of the Gentiles ſhall come
in. And yet it is no prejudice to any particular man,
becauſe the things ye are to taſt of are ſpirituall. Go to
all the good things in the world, the more one hath of
them, the leſſe another muſt have, becauſe they are
earthly and ſo are finite; but in ſpirituall things, all may
have the whole, and every man in particular. Every
man enjoyeth the light of the Sunne in particular, and
all enjoy it too; So the whole Church, and onely the
Church injoyes the benefit and comfort of this
feaſt; but under the name of this Church, come all the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117791:13"/>
elect, both Jewes and Gentiles; and therefore it muſt
be the Lord of Hoaſts that can make ſuch a feaſt as
this is, a feaſt for all people. No other is able to doe
it.</p>
            <p>This feaſt,<note place="margin">Chriſt the chiefe diſh in the Feaſt.</note> is a feaſt of fat things, full of marrow, and
of wine on the lees well refined, the beſt that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
the beſt of the beſt; A feaſt is promiſed, a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
feaſt. The ſpeciall graces and favours of God are
compared to a feaſt made up of the beſt things, full of all
varieties and excellencies; and the chiefe diſh (that is
all in all) is Chriſt, and all the gracious benefits wee
by promiſe can in any wiſe expect from him; All other
favours and bleſſings whatſoever they are, are but Chriſt
diſhed out (as I may ſo ſpeake) in ſeverall offices and
attributes; he is the originall of comfort, the principle of
grace and holineſſe, all is included in Chriſt. Aske of
him and yee ſhall obtaine, even the forgiveneſſe of your
ſinnes, peace of conſcience, and communion of Saints.
Aske of Chriſt as of one inveſted with all priviledges for
the good of others, but yet this is by his death; he is
the feaſt it ſelfe, he is diſhed out into promiſes; have
you a promiſe of the pardon of ſinnes, it is from Chriſt;
wouldſt thou have peace of conſcience, it is from Chriſt;
juſtification, and redemption, it is from Chriſt; the love
of God is derived to us by Chriſt, yea, and all that we have
that is good, is but Chriſt parcelled out.</p>
            <p>Now I will ſhew why Chriſt with his benefits,<note place="margin">Why Chriſt with his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Feaſt.</note> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives,
graces, and comforts, is compared to a
feaſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Becauſe the favours we have by Chriſt are choice ones.</note> in regard of the choice of the things; In a feaſt
all things are of the beſt, ſo are the things we have in
Chriſt: whatſoever favours we have by Chriſt, they
are choice ones, they are the beſt of every thing; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for ſin, is a pardon of pardon; the title we have for
heaven, through him, is a ſure title; the joy we have
by him, is the joy of all joyes; the liberty and freedom
from ſin, which he purchaſed for us by his death, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117791:13"/>
freedome; the riches of grace we have by him,
are the only laſting, and durable riches; take any thing
that you can, if we have it by Chriſt it is of the beſt: All
worldly excellencies and honours, are but meere ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
to the high excellencies, and honour we have in
Chriſt. No joy, no comfort, no peace, no riches, no
inheritance to be compared with the joy, peace, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
which we have in Chriſt; whatſoever we
have by him we have it in a glorious manner: And
therefore he is compared to fat, to fat things full of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
to wine, to wine on the lees that preſerveth the
freſhneſſe of it; the beſt wine of all, that is not changed
from veſſell to veſſell, but keepeth its ſtrength; And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the ſtrength and vigour of all floweth from Jeſus
Chriſt in covenant with us.</p>
            <p>The love of Chriſt is the beſt love, and he himſelfe
incomparably the beſt, and hath favours, and bleſſings
of the choiſeſt.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">2. There is variety of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in Chriſt.</note> as in a feaſt, beſides choice, there is variety;
ſo in Chriſt there is variety anſwerable to all our wants.
Are we fooliſh, he is wiſdome; have we guilt in our
conſciences, he is righteouſneſſe, and this righteouſneſſe
is imputed unto us; are we defiled, he is ſanctification;
are wee in miſery, he is our redemption. If there be a
thouſand kinds of evils in us, there is a thouſand waies
to remedy them by Jeſus Chriſt; Therefore the good
things we have by Chriſt, are compared to all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
we have in this world, in Chriſt is choice and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety.
Are we weake, he is meat to feed us, that we
may be ſtrong, he will refreſh us, he is the beſt of
meats, he is marrow; ſo are our ſpirits faint, he is
wine: thus we have in Chriſt to ſupply all our wants,
he is variety.</p>
            <p>There is a plant among the Indians called by the
name of <hi>Coquus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chriſt like the Indian plant <hi>Coquus,</hi> good for all things.</note> the fruit thereof ſerveth for meat and
drinke, to comfort and refreſh the body: It yeeldeth
that whereof the people make apparell to cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117791:14"/>
withall; and alſo that which is phiſicall, very good
againſt the diſtempers of the body: And if God will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
ſo much vertue into a poore plant, what vertue may
we expect to be in Chriſt himſelf? He feedeth our ſoules
to all eternity, puts upon us the roabes of righteouſneſſe,
heales the diſtempers of our ſoules; there is variety in
him for all our wants whatſoever. He is food, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,
and apparell to cloath us; and when we are cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with him, we may with boldneſſe ſtand before the
Majeſty of God; He is all in all, He is variety, and all.
There is ſomething in Chriſt anſwerable to all the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
of Gods people, and not only ſo, but to their full
content in every thing.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">3. There is ſufficiency and fulneſſe in Chriſt.</note> as there is variety in a Feaſt, ſo there is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,
full ſufficiency. <hi>We beheld the only begotten Son
of God, full of grace and truth.</hi> And being full of grace,
He is wiſe, and able to furniſh this heavenly banquet,
with enough of all ſorts of proviſions fit for the ſoule to
feed upon. Ther's abundance of grace, and excellency,
and ſufficiency in Chriſt; And it muſt needs be, becauſe he
is a Saviour of Gods owne ſending. <hi>Labour not therefore
for the meate that periſheth, but for the meat that the Son
of God ſhall give you, for him hath God the Father ſealed.</hi>
That is, ſent forth for this purpoſe to feed the Church
of God. As there is an all-ſufficiency in God, ſo in
Chriſt, who by the ſacrificing of himſelfe was able to
give ſatisfaction to divine juſtice. Therefore (ſaith he)
<hi>My fleſh is meate indeed, and my bloud is drinke indeed.</hi>
That is, ſpiritually to the ſoule he is food indeed, and can
ſatisfie Gods juſtice. If we conſider him as God alone,
he is a conſuming fire; or as man alone, he can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
But conſidered as God-man, he is meate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and drinke indeed. And now the ſoule is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with that, which Divine juſtice is contented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
though our conſciences be large, yet God is larger,
and above our conſciences: Therefore as there is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of excellency, ſo is there ſufficiency, and fulneſſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117791:14"/>
in Chriſt; what he did, he did to the full. He is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and he filleth up that name to the full. His pardon
for ſinne, is a full pardon. His merits for us are full me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
His ſatisfaction to divine juſtice, a full ſatisfaction.
His redemption of our ſoules and bodies, a full redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
thus all he did was full.</p>
            <p>A Feaſt is for company,<note place="margin">4. As a Feaſt for many, ſo Chriſt is a feaſt for the community of Saints.</note> it is <hi>convivium,</hi> there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
at it; So <hi>Cicero</hi> preferres the name of <hi>convivium</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Latines, before the Greeke name <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
And this Feaſt is not for one, we are all invited to
it; the excellency of Chriſts Feaſt conſiſteth in the
Communion of Saints; for whoſoever takes part of it,
their ſpirits muſt agree one with another: Love is
the beſt, and chiefeſt diſh in this Feaſt; the more wee
partake of the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt, the more we love
one another. Chriſt by his ſpirit ſo works in the hearts
of the children of men, that bring a thouſand together
of a thouſand ſeverall nations, and within a little while
you ſhall have them all acquainted one with another; if
they be good, there is agreement of the ſpirit, and a
ſympathy between them, there is a kindred in Chriſt.
He is the true <hi>Iſaack;</hi> the death of Chriſt, and the bloud of
Chriſt, is the ground of all union and joy and comfort
whatſoever; the bloud of Chriſt ſprinkled upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
will procure that peace of conſcience, that ſhall
be a continuall Feaſt unto the ſoule. This Feaſt muſt
needs be wonderfull comfortable, for we do not feaſt
with thoſe that are like our ſelves, but we feaſt with
God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, ſent by Chriſt,
procured by the death of Chriſt; the Angells at this
Feaſt attend us, therefore it muſt needs be joyfull, no joy
comparable to the joy of a Feaſt; this is not every Feaſt,
this is a marriage Feaſt, at which we are contracted to
Chriſt. Now of all Feaſts, marriage Feaſts are moſt
ſumptuous; this is a marriage Feaſt for the Kings Son,
for Chriſt himſelfe, and therefore of neceſſity it muſt
be full of all choice varieties, and of the ſweeteſt of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117791:15"/>
things, of the moſt excellenteſt of things, and of the
quinteſcence of things. Here is all joy that belongeth
to a feaſt; Here it is to be had with Chriſt; what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
can be more glorious then that which is to be
had between Jeſus Chriſt and a chriſtian ſoule? when we
have hope of better things to come, then we finde the
ſweetneſſe of this communion. No harmony in the
world can be ſo ſweet as the harmony maintained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Chriſt and the ſoule. When we have this, and
are made one with God in Chriſt, our joy muſt
needs then be unſpeakable. When the contract is once
made between the ſoule and Chriſt, there cannot but be
aboundant joy; when the ſoule is joyned with Chriſt
by faith, it cannot but ſolace it ſelfe in a perpetuall jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
and a perpetuall feaſt in ſome degrees.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">5. Becauſe we have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attire of Chriſt, as men put on choice garments at Feaſts.</note> for a Feaſt ye have the choiceſt garments, as
at the marriage of the Lambe, <hi>White and fine linnen,</hi>
which is the righteouſneſſe of the Saints. When God
ſeeth theſe robes upon us, and the ſpirit of Chriſt in us,
then there is a robe of righteouſneſſe imputed, and a
garment of ſanctity whereby our ſoules are cloathed: ſo
this is a Feaſt that muſt have wonderfull glorious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire;
and when this marriage ſhall be conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
we are ſure to have a garment of glory put upon
us.<note place="margin">6. Becauſe he was reſembled by the Paſchal Lambe which was chooſen foure daies before out of the flock.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This was ſignified in old time by the Jewes, in the
Feaſt of the Paſſeover; not to name all reſemblances,
but onely one or two. The Lambe for the Paſſeover
(you know) was choſen out of the flocke from amongſt
the reſt, foure daies before the time appointed for that
Feaſt: So Chriſt is the true Paſchall Lambe, choſen of
God, before the foundation of the world was laid, to be
ſlaine for us.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">2. By Manna, to which Chriſt anſwers in many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</note> 
               <hi>Manna</hi> was a type of Chriſt, it came from
Heaven to feed the hungry bodies of the Iſraelites in the
wilderneſſe; even ſo came Chriſt, ſent from God the
Father, to be the eternall food, and upholder of the ſoules
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117791:15"/>
and bodies of every one of us. Manna was white and
ſweet; ſo is Chriſt, white in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe,
and alſo ſweet to delight the ſoule. Manna fell upon
the tents in the night; And Chriſt came, when dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
was ſpread over all the world. God gave Manna
freely from Heaven; ſo Chriſt was a free gift, and he
freely gave himſelfe to death, even to the curſed death
of the croſſe for us: All, both poore and rich, they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
Manna. Chriſt is a common food for King and
ſubject; all take part of Chriſt, neither Jew nor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
are exempted, but all may come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and buy freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
money. Of this Manna he that had leaſt had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
ſo here, he that hath leaſt of Chriſt, though he
take him with a trembling hand, yet he ſhall have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
for Chriſt is his; whoſoever hath the leaſt grace,
if it be true and ſound, hath grace enough to bring him
to eternall life. The Jewes wondred at the Manna,
ſaying what thing is this? So it is one of Chriſts names
to be called <hi>wonderfull, Iſaiah</hi> 9. 6. Grace and favour
from Chriſt is true ſpirituall Manna to the ſoule. Manna
fell in the wilderneſſe, even ſo musſt we remaine in the
wilderneſſe of this wretched world untill we come to
Heaven. Chriſt is Manna to us, and very ſweet in the
conveyance of his Word and Sacraments. When the
Iſraelites came into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Manna cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
not before: ſo when we come to Heaven (the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
purchaſed poſſeſſion) we ſhall have another kind
of Manna for our ſoules; we ſhall not there feed on
Chriſt, as in the Sacrament, no, but we ſhall ſee him
face to face, and know as we are knowne. In the
wilderneſſe of this world it is fit God ſhould convey this
Heavenly Manna to the ſoule whatſoever way he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.
Manna could not fall untill the Iſraelites had
ſpent all the proviſion they brought with them out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi>
and we cannot taſt of that heavenly Manna of
our Father, untill our ſoules are drawne away from
all worldly dependencies, and carnall delights, then
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117791:16"/>
indeed Manna will be ſweet and precious.</p>
            <p>What is this heavenly Manna,<note place="margin">Surely thoſe that are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall taſte Chriſt.</note> what is Chriſt and his
Father, what is the word and Sacraments, to a depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
vitious heart ſtuffed full with earthly vanities? alas,
it loatheth all theſe. As none taſted of Manna, but thoſe
that came out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo none ſhall taſte of Chriſt
but thoſe that are not of the world, that are come out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> out of ſinne and darkneſſe. Manna fell onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the tents of Iſraell, and in no other part of the
world, but only there, that none might have the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to eate of it, but Gods peculiar choſen ones. Chriſt
falls upon the tents of the righteous, and none ſhall
taſte of this bleſſed ſpirituall food but ſuch as are the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
of God, ſuch as are of the Church, ſuch as feele the
burthen of ſinne, and groane under it; oh the very taſte
of this heavenly Manna is ſweet to their ſoules, and to
none but them. Thus yee ſee the Feaſt that Chriſt
maketh for us in Mount Syon; and that this Manna doth
typifie Chriſt with all his benefits.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">3. By the rock in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> the hard rocke in the wilderneſſe, when it was
ſtrucken with the rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> preſently water guſhed
out in abundance, which preſerved life to the Iſraelites:
ſo Chriſt the rocke of our ſalvation, the ſtrength of his
Church, the rocke and fortreſſe of all his Saints; when
his precious ſide was gored with the bloudy lance upon
the croſſe, that the blood guſhed out, and in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and ſuch abundance, that by the ſhedding thereof our
ſoules are preſerved alive. He is both Manna and the
rocke of water; Manna had all in it, ſo had the rocke,
and all neceſſities are plentifully ſupplied by Chriſt. The
Church of God hath alwaies had bread to ſatisfie ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
hunger, it never wanted neceſſary comfots. It is
ſaid, <hi>Rev. 12. When the Church fled into the wilderneſſe,
God fed her there;</hi> alluding to the children of Iſraell, fed
by Manna. The Jewes did not want in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
nor the Church of God, never wanted comfort,
though in the midſt of the perſecution and oppreſſion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117791:16"/>
of all her enemies. When <hi>Elias</hi> was in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
he was fed. The Church of God ſhall not onely
be fed in her body, but in her ſoule, for Chriſt hath hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Manna for his Elect; this doth typifie the exceeding
joy of the Church, the hidden Manna, <hi>that neither eye
hath ſeen, nor eare heard of, neither can it enter into the
heart of man to conceive of thoſe joyes that the Church of
God ſhall have when the marriage ſhall be conſummated.</hi>
Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and peace of conſcience, they
are hid from the world, and ſometimes from Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
themſelves, though they ſhall injoy them hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>All the former Feaſts in times paſt were but types of
this.<note place="margin">4. By all the Jewiſh feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls.</note> The Feaſt of Tabernacles, the Feaſt of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
the ſpirituall Manna, and all other holy Feaſts,
were but to ſignifie and to ſhew forth this Feaſt by
Chriſt. But there is this difference between the type,
and the thing ſignified; by the type, the Paſſeover Lambe
was quite eaten up, but this Paſſeover Chriſt, that was
ſlaine for ſinne, can never be eaten up: We feed upon
him with our ſoules, he cannot be conſumed as the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
Lambe, nor as Manna, which was gone when the
Sunne aroſe; yea that Manna that was laid up for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
before the Arke, became nothing, but Chriſt
is in heaven for evermore for the ſoule to feed upon.
Though theſe were reſemblances, yet theſe failed, as it
is fit reſemblances ſhould faile; that is, come ſhort of
the body of the thing it ſelfe. Thus you ſee the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
comforts of a Chriſtian, may well and fitly be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to a Feaſt.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee God provideth a Feaſt,<note place="margin">5. By the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper.</note> and inviteth all.
In the Sacrament you have a Feaſt, a Feaſt of varieties,
not only bread, but wine, to ſhew the variety and full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of comfort in Chriſt: He intendeth full comfort.
As for our Adverſaries the Papiſts, they have dry Feaſts,
they give the people the bread, but the wine they keep
for themſelves, but God in Chriſt intendeth us full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117791:17"/>
whatſoever Chriſt did, it was full, his merits are
compleat, and his joy was full. He is fulneſſe it ſelfe,
and therefore whatſoever comes from him, muſt needs
be as he himſelfe is,<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> both full, and ſweet. He intendeth us
full conſolation;<note place="margin">Be prepared for this Feaſt.</note> Therefore we ought to be prepared to
partake of this Feaſt, in ſuch a manner, as that we may
have ful joy, and ful comfort; for there is in Chriſt enough
to ſatisfie all the hungry ſoules in the world, he himſelfe
being preſent at this heavenly banquet. <hi>All fullneſſe
dwells in him, from which we have all received, and grace
for grace.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Labour for large hearts to receive much.</note> Therefore let us labour to have large hearts,
for as our faith groweth more and more, ſo we ſhall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
more comfort, and more ſtrength from this holy Feaſt.
As the poore widdow, if her veſſels had not failed, the
oyle had not ceaſed; if there had bin more veſſels, there
had been more oyle; our ſoules are as theſe veſſels, let
us therefore labour, and make it our great buſineſſe to
have large ſoules, ſoules capable to drinke in this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
oyle of gladneſſe; for as much faith as we bring to
Chriſt, ſo much comfort we ſhall carry from him. The
favours of God in Chriſt being infinite, the more wee
fetch from him, the more glory we give unto him; but
if they were finite, we ſhould offend his bounty, he
might ſoon be drawne dry, and ſo ſend us away with an
uncomfortable anſwer, that he was not able to relieve
us. But Chriſt is infinite, and the more we have from
him, the more we may have: to him that hath ſhall be
given; the oftner we goe to Chriſt, the more honour
and glory we bring unto him; this is a banquet to the
full.</p>
            <p>Wee are now come to the banquet, and Chriſt is the
founder of it; nay, he is the Feaſt it ſelfe, he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it, and he it is that wee feed upon.</p>

            <p>1. The Appetite is raiſed with ſoure things, as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117791:18"/>
of Spirit, and mournfulneſſe of heart for ſinne, if
we will ever reliſh Chriſt aright we muſt labour to have
a quick apprehenſion of our ſinnes; we muſt do as the
Jewes did at the Paſſeover, They eat it with ſoure Herbs,
that they might thereby have the ſharper ſtomacks: So
muſt we, we muſt caſt our eyes into our owne hearts, and
conſider what vile wretches we are, how full of ſinne
and vanity, and this will be as ſoure Herbs to the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall
Lambe. We muſt joyne the ſweet benefits and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
that wee have in Chriſt with the conſideration
of our owne wretched and miſerable condition, and then
this heavenly ordinance cannot but be ſweet and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to our ſoules. I beſeech you enter into your owne
ſoules and conſider ſeriouſly under what guilt you lie, and
this will whet your appetite. <hi>A full ſtomack deſpiſeth the
honey comb:</hi> but in this appetite there is ſenſe of empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
&amp; from that ſenſe of emptines paine, and from pain an
earneſt deſire of ſatisfaction; thus it is in ſpirituall things,
we want Chriſt and all the ſpirituall comforts that flow
from him: There is an emptines in us, and we ſee a need
every day to feed upon the mercies of God in Chriſt.
There is an emptines in our ſouls, &amp; there muſt be a ſenſe
of that emptines, and pain from that ſenſe, which muſt ſtir
up a ſtrong endeavour to follow after that that we doe
deſire. Then Chriſt indeed is ſweet, when wee
finde our ſoules hungring and thirſting after him.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Second Means</note> if ſo bee wee would have that appetite of
Spirit that is fit for this Feaſt, <hi>wee muſt purge our ſouls
from the corruptions of Fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the feare of God;</hi> we muſt cleanſe our ſoules from
thoſe luſts and paſſions that dayly cleave unto them; all
crudities muſt be taken away that the edge of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
may not be flatted: for while theſe earthly carnall
Corruptions lye upon the ſoule, we can expect no ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
appetite to heavenly things. Let us therefore exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
our ſelves what filth lies upon our ſoules, and what
corrupt inclinations are there, that ſo they may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117791:18"/>
and our deſires be carryed fully after Chriſt in the
Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Another means to get appetite is to conſider through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what is required of a Chriſtian well to maintaine the
trade of Chriſtianity.<note place="margin">Third Means.</note> Its another manner of thing than
we we take it for to entertaine Communion with God,
to performe holy Duties in an holy manner, to beare
the yoke as a Chriſtian ſhould do. Here is a great deal of
ſtrength required: And becauſe corruptions will mix
themſelves amongſt our beſt performances, there
muſt be a great deal of mercy from God to pardon them.
And whence is all this but by the death of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
Jeſus Chriſt? for his ſake God hath a forbearing eye.
Now if we conſider what a degree of ſpirituall ſtrength
&amp; vigor we ſhould have to go through with theſe duties,
this would ſharpen our ſtomacks and ſpirituall appetites,
to furniſh our ſelves with grace from Chriſt to go through
with theſe holy Services. There muſt be an exerciſing
of all the duties of Chriſtianity, which is an eſtate, that
muſt be maintained with a great deale of charge, and
labour. A man can doe no ſervice acceptable to God,
but by grace, and grace muſt feed the ſoule with fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
knowledge in the power of Faith, and when the
ſoule feeleth a neceſſity of grace, oh then beloved, it
hungers, and earneſtly thirſteth after the love of God in
Chriſt. Wee need to every Trade a great deale of
knowledge, then ſurely the calling of Chriſtianity
needeth a great deale. A Chriſtian muſt expect much
both in Proſperity, and Adverſity, as the Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>I have learned to want and to abound, to bee
in honour, and to bee in diſgrace, and I can doe all things
through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me.</hi> Now becauſe there
is ſo much goings out for the maintenance of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
wee muſt alſo bring in much grace, and faith, and
love, and holineſſe, or elſe we ſhall never be able to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
this condition. Where there is an exerciſe of
Chriſtianity, there willl be an appetite to heaven: that is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117791:19"/>
our beſt calling, for when that we have done all that wee
can, that that wee muſt have comfort from, is Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
therefore labour with all labour, to bee holy and
able Chriſtians. All other Callings are but for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
life, but that that is for eternity, is this Calling of
Chriſtianity: And this is onely to fit us here in this
world for an everlaſting condition of glory in the world
to come.</p>
            <p>Again,<note place="margin">Fourth Means, Acquaintance with thoſe that are good.</note> if we would have a deſire and appetite to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things, we muſt labour to get acquaintance, and
conſtantly converſe with thoſe that are good. The old
Proverb is, <hi>Company will make a man fall to,</hi> eſpecially
the company of thoſe that are better than our ſelves, for
very emulation men will be doing as others doe. When
men live amongſt thoſe whoſe hearts are framed this
way, they muſt be equall. Converſation with thoſe that
have good reliſh of ſpirituall things, and ſhew forth
grace in their lives, ſetteth an appetite upon our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
to deſire the ſame things that they doe. Thus
St. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to the Gentiles to ſtirre up the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
of the Jewes. Therefore receive this likewiſe
for the procuring of a ſpirituall appetite.</p>
            <p>To goe on.<note place="margin">Fifth Means, We know not how long wee have to live.</note> The next thing that may ſtirre up our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to get an appetite to the beſt things, is ſeriouſly to
conſider, That we cannot tell how long we have to live,
or may enjoy the benefit of the meanes of grace. Thoſe
that ſit at Table and diſcourſe away the greateſt part of
Dinner time in talke, had need at laſt to fall to ſo much
the faſter, by how much the more negligent they had
been before in eating. We cannot tell how long we may
enjoy this ſpirituall Feaſt that God makes for us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be ſtirred up to get ſpirituall appetites, for we know
not how long God will ſpread a Table for us; we know
not how long we ſhall enjoy our lives, and if we be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
on the ſuddaine, wee may ſuffer a ſpirituall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
a Famine of the ſoule if wee have nothing to
comfort us before hand: And of all Famines a ſpirituall
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117791:19"/>
Famine is moſt grievous,<note place="margin">Wee ſhould hold out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt hunger to come.</note> moſt fearfull. Therefore doe
as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did, and be wiſe. He in the ſeven yeares of
Plenty, gathered for ſeven yeares of Famine that was to
come upon the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Alas, if we have nothing
laid up before hand, what will be our end? we ſhall lie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to Gods wrath and anger; nothing can ſupport our
ſoules in the evill time: wherefore as you deſire at that
day to have comfort of thoſe things yee ſhall ſtand moſt
in need of, labour to get a good appetite: for to periſh
and ſtarve at a Feaſt is a ſhame; to famiſh in the liberty
of the Goſpell, and plenty of ſpirituall meat is ſhamefull,
and diſhonourable. Thus you ſee, beloved, (not to be
large in the point) how you may procure ſuch an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
as is fit for ſuch an holy Feaſt. Firſt, by getting a
ſenſe of ſinne: Secondly, by ſeeing a neceſſity of Chriſt:
Thirdly, by purging out thoſe Luſts that lye upon the ſoul:
Fourthly, by converſing with thoſe that are ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
minded: And laſtly, by conſidering the time to
come.</p>
            <p>It is not enough to have a ſtomack,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. 3.</note> but we muſt have
a ſpirituall diſpoſition of ſoule to heavenly things,<note place="margin">Get a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſpoſition of ſoul to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things.</note> as we
have to outward things. Labour to have a taſte of good
things, and a diſtinguiſhing taſte of heavenly things from
other things: God is the God of nature, and hath furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
us with five ſenſes, and as he hath given us ſenſe to
apprehend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo he hath furniſhed the Creature with varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of excellencies, ſuitable to all our ſeverall ſences; he
will not have objects in the Creature without ſenſe, nor
ſence in man without objects:<note place="margin">The ſoule hath her ſenſes.</note> Hee hath furniſhed man
with ſenſes, and variety of ſenſes, and given fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
objects for thoſe ſenſes: The ſoule alſo hath
her ſenſe, whereſoever there is life there is ſenſe. God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given ſpirituall life to the ſoul, he doth maintain that
life with ſpiritual food. As in a Feaſt there is ſight, and the
eie is not only fed there with rich furniture, but with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of dainties; the ear likewiſe, &amp; the ſmel is ſatisfied, the
one with Muſick, the other with ſweet ſavors. So in this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117791:20"/>
Feaſt there is to delight both the eare, and the ſmell of
the ſoule, the one with hearing the gracious promiſes of
Jeſus Chriſt, and the other in receiving the ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of that ſacrifice, that was offered up once for all;
nothing ſo ſweet to the ſoule as the bleſſings of Chriſt;
he is ſweet in the word, as the veſſell that conveyeth
him into our ſoules. Thus you ſee in this feaſt all the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the ſight, the ſmell, the taſte, and hearing, all are
ſatisfied: and a great care had in the proviſion for the
Feaſt, that our outward man may be pleaſed. And
ſhall the Lord of Hoſts make a Feaſt, and not content
the whole man? he is for our ſight, if we have ſpirituall
eyes to ſee; the eare, if we have eares to heare; all the
ſenſes are exerciſed here: What is the reaſon why car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
men cannot reliſh a pardon for ſinne, and juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſanctification, and holineſſe, nor goe boldly to
God? It may be they have good ſweet notions of theſe,
but they have no ſpirituall taſte or reliſh of them, and all,
becauſe they want ſpirituall life; None but a Chriſtian
can have ſpirituall taſte anſwerable to a ſpirituall life.
Taſte is a kind of feeling, one of the moſt neceſſary ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and a Chriſtian cannot be without reliſh and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
yea it is the very beeing of a Chriſtian to have a
taſte of ſpirituall things: Of all other ſenſes there is a
ſtronger application in taſte; the other ſenſes fetch their
objects afarre off, but as for taſte there is a neer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
in it, and therefore moſt neceſſary: every life
is maintained by taſt. <hi>Taſte and ſee how good the Lord
is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now taſte doth two things,<note place="margin">Two things in ſpirituall taſt.</note> it doth reliſh that that is
good, and diſreliſh the contrary; there muſt be a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
taſte to diſcerne of differences. There can be
no ſpirituall taſte, but it muſt know what is good and
profitable for the ſoule, and what is not: becauſe God
will not have our taſtes to be wronged, yee ſee what
courſe he takes. Firſt the eye ſeeth what things we taſte
on, and if the eye be diſpleaſed, ſo alſo is the ſmell.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:117791:20"/>
Thus God layeth before us ſpirituall things, knowledge
of good and bad, and giveth us many <hi>caveats,</hi> and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he would not have us to taſte things hurtfull for
the ſoule, nor poiſon inſtead of meate. Now when we
have taſted that which is good, let us take heed it be not
a taſte onely, leſt we fall into the ſinne againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Vſe. 4.</note> beſide taſte, there muſt be a diſgeſting of
what we taſte,<note place="margin">Wee muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things.</note> and that throughly, in our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
when we apprehend a thing to be true and good
it muſt be diſgeſted throughly into the affections. Love
to the beſt things, muſt be above all other love whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
yet this muſt be diſgeſted. Men oftentimes have
ſweet notions, but alas they are but notions, they doe
not diſgeſt them into their affections. It is the laſt diſge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
that nouriſheth, and when any ſpirituall truths are
underſtood throughly, then comes in ſpirituall ſtrength,
and hereupon the ſoule comes and ſuckes in that virtue
which is for the nouriſhment of it, thus it is in the ſoule,
upon diſgeſtion, there is nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>Againe there muſt be a faculty to retaine what wee
have received, that it maybe diſgeſted; yee have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that love to heare, but they do not diſgeſt. If there
be nothing in the ſoule, nothing can be extracted, and
therefore we muſt learne to retaine neceſſary truths, that
ſo upon occaſion they may come from the memory into
the heart; though indeed they are not in their proper
place when they are in the memory only, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
if they are there, they may with eaſe be brought
down into the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Then we muſt labour to walke in the ſtrength of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
things.<note place="margin">Vſe. 5.</note> For what is the uſe of this Feaſt,<note place="margin">Wee muſt walk in the ſtrength of ſpirituall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</note> but to
cheriſh both ſoule and ſpirit? the uſe of ſpirituall things
which we have through Chriſt, is to cheriſh and enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
It conveyeth ſtrength to us, that we may walke
in the ſtrength of Chriſt, as <hi>Elias</hi> did fourty daies in the
ſtrength of his food. And conſider, though in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117791:21"/>
and conditions we have variety of changes, yet
in Chriſt we have ſeverall comforts ſuitable to all our
ſeverall conditions. If ſo be our ſinnes trouble us, wee
ſhould watch over our ſelves, that wee be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
caſt downe, but feed upon ſpirituall things in
conſideration of pardon for ſinne in the bloud of Chriſt;
this is the grand iſſue of all that Chriſt hath traced out in
the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes. He is not, he cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided;
where he pardons ſinnes, he ſanctifieth; where
he ſanctifieth, he writes his law in their hearts, ſo that
there is a chaine of ſpirituall favours, where the firſt
linke is, all the reſt follow; where forgiveneſſe of ſinne
is, there is the ſpirit, and that ſpirit ſanctifieth, and
comforts, and is an earneſt of everlaſting life; therefore
feed eſpecially upon the favours of God, and get for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe
of ſinnes, and then all the reſt of the chaine
of grace and ſpirituall life will follow.</p>
            <p>Sometimes wee ſtand in need of preſent grace and
comfort, and we are undone if comforts and grace are
not at hand, never conſidering the promiſes that are to
come; as that promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>I will be with thee
to the end of the world, feare not;</hi> No temptation ſhall
befall us, but we ſhall have an iſſue out of it, and it
ſhall worke together for the good of all thoſe that feare
God. This is <hi>Aquavitae</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the ſoule of man, therefore
the gracious promiſes of Chriſt and his holy Spirit wee
ſhould ever remember to get into our ſoules, for when
all other comforts faile, then commeth in the comforts
of the Spirit, who will be with us and uphold us in all
extremities; if we had nothing in this world to comfort
our ſpirits, yet let us rejoyce in hope of glory to come.
<hi>Our life is hid with Chriſt, wee have the hidden Manna,
in him we rejoyce in hope of glory, Rom.</hi> 5. 2. And the
way to maintaine a Chriſtian holy life, is to make uſe of
all the privileges of chriſtianity, and of thoſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that convey theſe privileges to our ſoules.</p>
            <p>Now that we may the better do this, obſerve conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117791:21"/>
what it is that hinders us, that we cannot feed
upon ſpirituall things as we ſhould doe, whatſoever it is,
we muſt labour conſtantly to remove it.</p>
            <p>Now what muſt follow after this Feaſt?<note place="margin">Conſequents of this Feaſt is ſpirituall chearfulneſſe.</note> why ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
chearefulneſſe; if we finde this in our duties of
Chriſtianity, it is a ſigne we have fed upon ſpirituall
things; the nature of a ſpirituall Feaſt is to empty the
foule of ſinne, and to fill it full of gracious thoughts and
actions; inſtead thereof it moderates all things, it
makes us uſe the world as if we uſed it not: when wee
can do this, we may certainly know that our ſoules
have taſted of abundance of benefit by this Feaſt.</p>
            <p>A man that hath no ſpirituall joy, is drowned, for the
moſt part, in the contentments of the world; drowned
in riches and honours, and theſe are like to ſtrong wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

            <p>Here we ſee how to make this ſpirituall food fit for

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117791:22"/>
our owne falſe and carnall hearts, and againſt the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
imputations of the world; when our hearts are
ready to be falſe to us, and hanker after the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the world, and are ready to ſay the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
that they can enjoy, is in the things below:
Let us anſwer our baſe and falſe diſputing hearts, that the
waies of wiſdome, the waies that God directs us to,
they onely are the waies of pleaſure. And Religion is
that that makes the hearts of the children of men joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and a good conſcience onely makes a continuall
feaſt, ſo long as man liveth; but eſpecially at the houre
of death, when all the comforts of the world ceaſe,
then conſcience ſtandeth our friend.<note place="margin">Object.</note> But the worlds
objection is,<note place="margin">Religious people are melancholy.</note> that of all kind of men in the world, thoſe
that profeſſe Religion are the moſt melancholy: But if
it be ſo, it is becauſe they are not religious enough, their

people may have ſpirituall joy, and inward conſolation,
and yet not know of it: there may be ſuch a time when
they may be ſad, and droope, and that is, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
God doth not looke pleaſantly upon them; but
the true character of a Chriſtian is to be cheerfull, &amp; none
elſe can be truly chearefull or joyous: Joy is uſurped by
others, there is no comfort in them that can be ſaid to
be reall. All the joy of a man that is a carnall man, is but
as it were the joy of a Traytor, he may come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and feaſt with the reſt of Gods people, but what
mirth or joy can he have ſo long as the Maſter of the
Feaſt frownes upon him? Where Chriſt is not, there
God is not reconciled; no joy like that joy of him that
is aſſured of the love of God in Chriſt. A man may
ſometime through ignorance want that joy that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

               <hi>Rejoyce ye righteous, and be glad;</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to thoſe that are in Chriſt, and to the righteous
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:117791:22"/>
to rejoyce, for joy is all their portion: They onely can
juſtifie the waies of God, againſt all reproaches what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
but the eyes of carnall men are ſo held in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that they can ſee no joy, no comfort in this courſe.
As it is ſaid of <hi>Auſtin</hi> before his converſion, hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to turne Chriſtian indeed, leſt he ſhould want all
thoſe joyes and pleaſures that the world did then afford
him; but after he was converted, then he could cry,

            <p>Take a Chriſtian at the worſt,<note place="margin">A Chriſtian at the worſt, is happier then a worldling at the beſt.</note> and he is better then

an heire of heaven; The evill of evils is taken away
from him; take him at the worſt, he is an heire of heaven,
but take the wicked at the beſt, he is not a child of God,
he is a ſtranger to God, he is as a branch cut off, and as
miſerable a wretch as ever <hi>Belſhazzer</hi> in the midſt of his

when he ſaw the writing on the wall. When a
man apprehends the wrath of God hanging over his
head, though he were at the greateſt feaſt in the world,
and amongſt thoſe that make mirth and jollity, yet ſeeing
vengeance ready to ſeize upon him, it cannot but dampe
all his joy and all his carnall pleaſures; and therefore only
a Chriſtian hath a true title to this feaſt.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you let us labour earneſtly to have our part

hath invited thee, and he will not alwaies be inviting
thee: therefore come in, and ſtudy the excellencies of
Chriſt. When ſuch perſons as theſe ſee they need mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and grace, and reconciliation, and muſt either have
it, or elſe be damned for ever; now they are earneſt to
ſtudy the favour and love of God in Chriſt; now they
beſtirre themſelves to get peace of conſcience, and joy
in the Holy Ghoſt; now they ſee ſalvation to be founded
onely on Chriſt, and all other excellencies belonging to
Chriſtianity; and therefore he goeth conſtantly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with grace and holineſſe, ſo in this life, that he
may not loſe his part in glory in the life to come. Think
of this and pray for it, as they in the Goſpell, <hi>Lord ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
give us of that bread;</hi> here is hope that thou maiſt
be ſaved, becauſe thou art invited to come in: to what
end is the miniſtry of the Goſpel, but to intreat thee to
be reconciled? Oh let this worke upon our ſoules, when
we heare of the excellencies of theſe things, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with them conſider of the neceſſity that is caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us to obtaine them, and that we muſt have them or
elſe be damned eternally: Wee muſt doe as the Leapers
did,<note place="margin">We are ſure to periſh without Chriſt.</note> who ſaid one to another, <hi>Why ſit we here till we die;
if we ſay wee will enter into the City, why the famine is in
the City, and we ſhall die there, and if we ſit ſtill here, wee
ſhall alſo die,</hi> now what courſe tooke they? <hi>They ſaid
one to another, let us enter into the campe of the</hi> Syrians,
<hi>there is meat to feed us.</hi> So ſaith the ſoule, if I goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the City of the world, there I ſhall be ſtarved, if I
ſit ſtill, I ſhall alſo periſh; what ſhall I now doe, I will
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117791:23"/>
venture upon Jeſus Chriſt, he hath food that endures to
eternall life, and if I periſh there, I periſh; If I have not
Chriſt I muſt die, the wrath of God hangeth over my
head, and I cannot eſcape. Alas poore ſoule, now thou
ſeeſt thy wretchedneſſe, caſt thy ſelfe upon him, and
come in: If thou ventureſt, thou canſt but die, adventure
therefore, put thy ſelfe upon Gods mercy, for he is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and full of compaſſion.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that have given up themſelves to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Honour God by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</note> let
them ſtudy to honour God, and Chriſt, by taking thoſe
comforts that are allotted to them. When any man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viteth
us to a Feaſt, he knoweth if we reſpect him, wee
will fall too: God hath beſtowed his Sonne upon
us, and will he not with him give us all things? let us
not therefore diſhonour the bounty of our good God,
but come in, and labour to have our hearts more and
more inlarged with the conſideration of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of theſe eternall comforts. The fulneſſe of
Chriſt is able to ſatisfie the ſoule, though it were a
thouſand times larger then it is. If it were poſſible
that wee could get the capacity of Angels, it could not
be ſufficient to ſhew forth the fulneſſe of pleaſures that
are provided for a Chriſtian; let us therefore labour
with all labour to open our hearts to entertaine theſe
joyes, for we cannot honour God more then of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to receive thankfully what he freely offers. To taſte
plentifully in the covenant of grace, of theſe riches, and
joy, and hope of things to come, glorious above all that
we are able to thinke of: I ſay, this is the way to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God under the Goſpel of hope, of things that are
infinite, the more we take, the more we may take, and
the more we honour him that giveth. Let us therefore
enter deeply into our ſpeciall ſinnes, there is no feare
of deſpaire; thinke of all thy wants, and of all thy ſins,
let them be never ſo many, yet there is more to be had
in Chriſt, then there can be wanting in thee. The
ſoule that thinkes it ſelfe full of wants, is the richeſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117791:24"/>
ſoule, and that that apprehendeth no want at all, no
need of grace or Chriſt, is alwaies ſent empty away;
grieve therefore for thy ſinnes, and then joy that thou
haſt grieved, and goe to God for the ſupply of all thy
wants. The ſeeds of joy and of comfort are ſowne in
teares, and griefe in this world, but yet we know we
ſhall reape in joy in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Remember this, we have we know not what to goe
through withall in this valley of teares. That ſpeech of
<hi>Barzillai</hi> was good and excellent, who being by <hi>David</hi>
himſelfe invited to the Court, anſwered, I am now
growne old, I am not fit for the Court, for my ſenſes
are decayed and gone; even ſo the time will come
when our ſenſe of reliſhing earthly pleaſures will utterly
be loſt, we are ſure to goe to our graves, and we know
not what particular trouble we may meet with in this
world, and goe through, if we live to a full age. Alas,
what are all comforts here, to the comforts of eternity:
when our daies are ſpent on earth, then comes in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
of pleaſure, or everlaſting ſorrow. Oh then, if
(when we ſhall leave all behind us) we have the joy
of the holy Ghoſt in our hearts, it will advance us above
all the ſuggeſtions of ſinne or Satan, and bring us cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
above to the tribunall ſeat of Chriſt. Labour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to have a ſpirituall reliſh of ſoule, to grow in grace
and comforts of the holy Ghoſt, for the time will come
when we ſhall wiſh that we had had more then we have,
every one will repent of looſenes and ſlacknes in the
waies of holineſſe: Therefore let us labour earneſtly to
be good husbands for our ſoules for the time to come.</p>

               <q>And in this Mountaine ſhall the Lord of Hoſts make unto

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have heretofore ſpoken of the Feaſt
that God makes to his Church, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the later times, which was ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
performed at the firſt comming of
Chriſt, when the Gentiles came in: But
the conſummation and perfection of all
will be at the day of judgement, then
God will ſpread a Table for his to all eternity.</p>
            <p>We have ſpoken heretofore at large of the reſemblance
of ſpirituall good things, by this compariſon of a Feaſt,
God ſets out ſpirituall things by outward, becauſe wee
cannot otherwiſe conceive of them: the beſt things in
grace, by the beſt, and ſweeteſt things in Nature. And
thus God enters into our ſoules by our ſenſes, as we ſee
in the Sacrament.<note place="margin">The Spirit of God muſt work us to a reliſh of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But wee have ſpoken at large of this: Our care
muſt be to have a ſpeciall taſte, a ſpirituall appetite, to
reliſh this Feaſt that God provides; naturally wee are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:117791:25"/>
diſtaſtfull, we reliſh not ſpirituall, and heavenly things,
we ſavor not the things of God. And the ſpirit of God
muſt alter our ſavor, and taſte as he doth; whereſoever
there is ſpirituall life, there is ſpirituall reliſh of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
truths.</p>
            <p>Now let me adde this further,<note place="margin">We muſt bring ſomething to the Feaſt, though not of our owne.</note> that though it be made
by God, yet we muſt bring ſomething to this Feaſt: Chriſt
feaſteth with us, as yee have <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. he ſups with us, not
that wee have grace from our ſelves, or can bring any
thing, he bringeth his own proviſion, with him when hee
ſuppeth with us; But yet by the Covenant of grace
whereby he enters into termes of friendſhip with us, we
muſt ſup with him, wee muſt have grace to entertaine
him, though it is at his owne coſt; yet we muſt have
ſomething: he doth not require us to pay our debts, but
he giveth us wherewith, ſecretly he bids us come, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
a ſecret Meſſenger to draw us; he ſends his ſpirit
certainly; certainly hee will have us bring ſomthing
when wee come to feaſt, but it is of his owne giving:
And that we are to bring, is humble and empty ſoules,
(wherein we are to delight our ſelves in ſenſe of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe,)<note place="margin">Wee muſt bring empty ſoules, and a ſpirit of Faith, and a ſpirit of Love.</note>
and the ſpirit of faith to believe his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
that pleaſeth him when we can honour him with a
Spirit of Faith, and then a Spirit of Love, and new Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
ſpringing from a Spirit of Faith and Love: theſe
bee the things Chriſt requires wee ſhould have. Our
ſoules muſt be thus furniſhed that Chriſt may delight to
dwell with us: And therefore it is a good importuning
of God; Lord I deſire thou ſhouldeſt dwell in mee,
and prepare my ſoule as a fit Temple, vouchſafe me the
graces thou delighteſt in, and delighteſt to dwell in. So
wee may begge of God his Holy Spirit to furniſh our
ſoules, ſo as he may dwell, and delight in us.</p>
            <p>But we have ſpoken largely of the former Verſe, I
will now ſpeak of the next that followeth.</p>
            <p>And I will deſtroy in this Mountaine the face of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
caſt over all people, and the vaile ſpread over all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117791:25"/>
to ſwallow up death in victory, the Lord will wipe
away teares from all faces, and the rebukes of his people
ſhall be taken from the earth, for the Lord hath ſpoken it.</p>
            <p>Theſe depend one upon another, being the ſeverall
Services of the Feaſt.<note place="margin">The ſervices of this Feaſt.</note> He promiſeth a Feaſt in the ſixth
Verſe. And what be the ſeverall Services. He will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
in this <hi>mountaine,</hi> this <hi>Church,</hi> the face of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
caſt over all people, &amp;c. Hee will take away the
vaile of Ignorance, and unbeliefe, that they may have
ſpeciall ſight of heavenly things, without which they
cannot reliſh heavenly things, they can take no joy at
this Feaſt.</p>
            <p>And then, becauſe there can be no Feaſt, where there
is the greateſt enemy in force and power, he ſwallowes
up death in victorie. Death keeps us in feare all our life
time, that that ſwalloweth up all Kings and Monarchs;
the terror of the World Death ſhall bee, and is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by our head, Chriſt, and ſhall be ſwallowed
up by us in victory. In the meane time we are ſubject
to many ſorrowes which cauſe teares; for teares are but
drops that iſſue from that cloud of ſorrow: And ſorrow
we have alwayes in this world, either from our ſinnes,
or miſeries, or ſimpathy in teares of that kinde. Well,
the time will come that teares ſhall bee wiped away,
and the cauſe of teares; all ſorrow for our owne ſinnes,
for our own miſery, and for ſimpathizing with the times
wherein we live. Our time ſhall bee hereafter at the day
of the reſurrection, when all teares ſhall be wiped from
our eyes: God will performe that office of a mother to
wipe the childrens eyes, or of a Nurſe to take away all
cauſe of grief whatſoever, elſe it cannot be a perfect feaſt.</p>
            <p>I but there is reproaches caſt upon Religion, and
religious perſons, it goeth under a vaile of reproach,
and the beſt things are not ſeene in their owne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
nor the worſt things, they go under vizards here.</p>
            <p>But the time will come, that the rebukes of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhall be taken away. The good things as they are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117791:26"/>
beſt, ſo ſhall they be knowne to bee ſo: And ſinne, and
baſe courſes, as they are bad, and as they are from Hell,
ſo they ſhall be knowne to be; every thing ſhall appear
in its owne colours, things ſhall not goe masked any
longer. And what is the ſeal of all this? The ſeal of it is,
<hi>The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it;</hi> truth it ſelfe
hath ſpoken it, and therefore it muſt needs be, <hi>Jehovah</hi>
that can give a being to all things, he hath ſaid it.</p>
            <p>Wee have heard why the Church is called a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
He will deſtroy, or ſwallow up, as the word may
ſignifie, the face of covering, or the covering of the
face; the vaile which is the covering of the face, and
particularly expreſt in that terme, alwayes, the vaile that
is ſpread over all Nations.</p>
            <p>God will take away the ſpirituall vaile that covers
the Soules of his people, that is between them and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
truths. It hath alluſion to that of <hi>Exodus</hi> 34, about
<hi>Moſes</hi> when he came from the Mount, he had a vaile,
for the people could not behold him, hee had a glory put
upon his face, that they could not look upon him with
a direct eye, and therefore he was faine to put a vail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his face, to ſhew that the Jews could not ſee, as <hi>Paul</hi>
interprets it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15. To this day, ſaith hee, when
<hi>Moſes</hi> is read, there is a vaile put upon their hearts;
they could not ſee that the Law was a Schoole-maſter to
bring to Chriſt, the Ceremoniall Law, and the Morall
Law. God had a bleſſed end by the curſe of it, to bring
them to Chriſt: They reſted in the vaile, their ſight was
terminated in the vaile, they could not ſee through to
the end and ſcope of it. Nevertheleſſe, when they
ſhall turne to the Lord, the vaile ſhall be taken away.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> From the words conſider firſt of all, that natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there is a vaile of ignorance upon the ſoule.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, God doth take away his vaile, and God by
his Spirit onely can doe it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that this is onely in his Church: And where
this vaile of ignorance is taken off, there is feaſting with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:117791:26"/>
God, and ſpirituall joy, and delight in the beſt order:
And where it is taken off, there is none of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all by nature there is a vaile of covering over
all mens ſpirits.<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> To underſtand this better,<note place="margin">There is a vail over all mens ſpirits by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> let us unfold
the termes of vaile a little. There is a vaile either upon
the things themſelves that are to bee ſeen, or upon the
ſoule which ſhould behold them:<note place="margin">A two-fold vaile.</note> The vaile of things
themſelves is when they be hidden altogether, or in part,
when we know part,<note place="margin">1. Of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> and are ignorant of part. And this
vaile upon the things ariſeth from the weak apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them, when they are not repreſented in cleare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
but in obſcurity of words, or in types. When
we ſee them onely in types, or obſcure phraſes, which
hideth ſometime the ſight of the thing it ſelfe; The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Speech ſometimes caſteth a vaile on things; for
our Saviour Chriſt ſpake in Parables, which were like
the cloud darke on the one ſide, light on the other, darke
towards the Egyptians, light towards the Iſraelites: So
ſome expreſſions of Scripture have a light ſide, that
onely the godly ſee, and a darke ſide, that other men
good wit (as naturall men) ſee not.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">2 Of the ſouls not ſeeing, or not beleeving.</note> there is a vaile upon the Soule, and upon the
Sight; if the things be vailed, or the ſight vailed, there
is no ſight. Now the ſoule is vailed, when we be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and unbeleeving, when we are ignorant of what is
ſpoken and revealed, or when we know the termes of
it, and yet beleeve it not.</p>
            <p>Now this vaile of ignorance, and unbeliefe, continueth
in all unregenerate men, untill grace takes away the
vaile. Beſides, before a thing can be ſeene, the object
muſt not onely be made cleare, and the eye-ſight too, but
there muſt be <hi>Lumen deferens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 There muſt be a light to make things viſible.</note> a light to carry the object
to the eye: If that be not wee cannot ſee. As the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
in the three dayes of darkneſſe, had their eyes,
but there wanted light to repreſent the object; And
therefore they could not goe neare one to another; it is
the light and not ſight; if there be ſight, and no light to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117791:27"/>
carry and convey the object, we cannot ſay there is
ſight.</p>
            <p>That which anſwereth to this vaile, is the vaile of
Scripture, whereby heavenly things are ſet out by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery;
a miſtery is, when ſomething is openly ſhewed,
and ſomething hidden.</p>
            <p>When ſomething is concealed,<note place="margin">All things in religion are myſterious.</note> as in the Sacrament,
they be myſteries: we ſee the bread, we ſee the wine,
but under the bread and wine other things are intended;
the breaking of the body of Chriſt, and the ſhedding of
his bloud, and in that the love and mercy of God in
Chriſt, in giving him to death for us; and Chriſts love
to give himſelf to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice: theſe be the
things intended, which onely the ſoule ſees and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.
And ſo all things in the Church indeed are my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,
the incarnation of Chriſt, the union of both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that Chriſt ſhould ſave the world by ſuch a way
as he did, that he ſhould bring us to glory by ſhame, to
life, by death, to bleſſing and happineſſe, by being a
curſe for us; it is a myſtery to bring contrary out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
That ſo glorious a perſon as God, ſhould be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with our weake and ſinnefull nature: it was a
myſtery, the Jewes ſtumbled at it; light came, and
the darkeneſſe could not comprehend the light. And
as Chriſt was a myſtery himſelfe, ſo the Church is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
that God ſhould ſo much delight in a company of
poore men, the off-ſcowring of the world, to make
them temples of his holy Spirit, and heires of heaven,
men that were under the ſcorne of the world: this is
a myſtery, ſo all is myſticall, the head, the members,
the body, the Church, and every particular point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
there is a myſtery in repentance, no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what ſorrow for ſin is, but the true gracious perſon;
no man knowes what it is to believe, but he that hath an
heart to believe; no man knoweth what peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
and joy of the holy Ghoſt is, but thoſe that feele
it; ſo that is a myſtery. And therefore great is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117791:27"/>
of godlineſſe, ſaith the Apoſtle, not onely in the
points themſelves, but even the practice of Religion is
a myſtery too. Repentance, and Faith, and new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and love, and the comforts of Religion, are
all myſteries; there is a vaile upon them in all theſe
points, that a carnall man cannot ſee them.</p>
            <p>You ſee then in what ſenſe there is a vaile of the
things, and in what ſenſe there is a vaile on mens hearts;
that is, either the things themſelves are hid, or if the
things be open, they want ſight, and light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and they want faith to believe. Beloved, we live
in times that the object is cleare to us, the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are made cleare: as who knoweth not what
Chriſt is, and the notion of the incarnation, and of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with him; wee know them notionally, they be
opened and revealed to us very clearely, all the articles
of faith, and miſteries of Religion; ſo that there is no
obſcurity in the object, the things are cleare, ſpecially in
theſe places of knowledge: But yet notwithſtanding
there is a vaile upon the ſoule. The ſoule of every man
that is not graciouſly wrought upon by the ſpirit of God,
hath a vaile of ignorance, and unbeliefe.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, of Ignorance. There is a vaile of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in many,<note place="margin">1. Theres a vaile of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance on all naturall men.</note> and in all men naturally a vaile of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of ſpirituall things; for unleſſe they be revealed,
they can never be knowne to Angels themſelves: The
Angels themſelves know not the Goſpell till it be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and therefore they be ſtudents in it continually;
and the beſt men in the world know nothing in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
further then it is revealed; but there is a vaile of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
upon them that know theſe things notionally,<note place="margin">Naturall men know not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things in their proper ſpecies.</note>
becauſe they do not know them as they ſhould know
them; they doe not know them in <hi>propria ſpecie,</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
and heavenly things as ſpirituall and heavenly
things: they doe not know ſpirituall things as ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
things, they have a humane knowledge of ſpirituall
things. Thoſe that want grace, they know the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117791:28"/>
of the Scripture and Divinity, and they know how
to diſcourſe as Schoolemen doe, from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to argue; they know the Logicke and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricke
of the Scripture, but they ſticke in the ſtile, there
is ſomething they are ignorant of: That is, they have
not an eye of knowledge, as wee call it; they doe not
ſee the things themſelves, but onely they ſee things by
another bodies ſpirit, and they have no light of their
owne: And ſo no man knoweth naturally but the
children of God what originall ſinne is, what corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of nature is, nor knowes ſinne in its owne odious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
to be filthy, and to be dangerous as it is; to draw
the curſe and vengeance of God upon it, this is not
knowne, but by the ſpirit revealing the odiouſneſſe of
ſinne, that the ſoule may apprehend it, as Chriſt did
when he ſuffered for it, and as God doth. A gracious
man ſeeth it as God ſeeth it, becauſe by the ſpirit of
God hee ſeeth the filthineſſe and odiouſneſſe of it, and the
danger it draweth after it.</p>
            <p>And ſo in any points of Religion naturally, a man ſees
not them ſpiritually, as they are, and as God ſees them,
but he ſeeth them by a humane light; hee ſeeth heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things by a humane light, notionally, and meerely to
diſcourſe of them, he ſeeth not intritively into the things
themſelves, he ſeeth them <hi>ſub aliena ſpecie,</hi> under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
repreſentation then their owne; onely a godly man
ſeeth ſpirituall things as the ſpirit of God,<note place="margin">A godly man ſees ſpirituall things intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</note> and ſeeth
them as they are, knowes ſinne as it is, knoweth grace
to be as it is, and knoweth faith; what it is to believe,
what it is to have peace of conſcience, and the pardon
of ſinnes: he knoweth theſe things in ſome ſenſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritively,
though not ſo as he ſhall doe when he ſhall ſee
theſe things in heaven, when he ſhall ſee face to face.
There is a great difference in it, hee ſees them intritive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in reſpect of the knowledge of other men, though he
ſees but in a glaſſe, in regard of the knowledge hee ſhall
have in heaven: As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, for wee ſee but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117791:28"/>
as in a glaſſe; but he that ſees in a glaſſe ſeeth more life,
then he that ſees the dead picture of a man: So though
we ſee but in a glaſſe heavenly things, yet wee ſee them
better then thoſe that ſee them in a dead notion; though
it be nothing to the knowledge wee ſhall have in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
yet it is incomparable above the knowledge of any
carnall naturall man upon the earth.</p>
            <p>Againe, naturally men have vailes of ignorance upon the
moſt divine things; of ſpirituall things, ſuch as is union,
and as is the communion between Chriſt and us, and the
myſtery of regeneration in the new creature, ſuch as is
the joy in the holy Ghoſt, the inward peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
I will not name the particulars to inſiſt on them,
but give you onely an iuſtance; though they know the
notion of theſe things, yet they are altogether ignorant
of them: their knowledge is a meere outward light,
it is a light radicated in the ſoule; It is not as the light of
the Moone, which receiveth light from the Sunne, but
it is a light radicated and incorporated into the ſoule, as
the light of the Sunne is by the ſpirit, it is in the ſoule; it
is not onely upon the ſoule, but in the ſoule; the heart ſees
and feeleth, and knoweth divine truths: there is a
power and vertue in the ſight and knowledge of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
man, there is none in the knowledge of a carnall
man. The light of a candle hath a light in it, but no
vertue at all goeth with it;<note place="margin">The light of the godly is a light with influence, the light of the wicked is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</note> but the light of the Sunne,
and the light of the ſtarres, they have a ſpeciall vertue,
they have heate with them, and they have an influence
in a ſpeciall kind on inferiour bodies working together
with the light; So it is with heavenly apprehenſion
and knowledge, it actually conveyeth light but with
the light there is a bleſſed and gracious influence, there
is heate and efficacy with that light. But though a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
man know all the body of divinity, yet it is a meere
light without heat,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> a light without influence: It is not
experimentall. As a blind man can talke of colours, if he
be a Scholler, and deſcribe them better then he that hath
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117791:29"/>
his eyes, he being not a Schollar: but he that hath his
eyes can can judge of colours a great deale better.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
by booke a Schollar can tell you forraigne
countries, better than he that hath travelled, yet the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
that hath bin there, can tell them more diſtinctly;
So he that is experienced in that kind, though a ſtranger,
can meaſure another mans ground better then himſelfe,
he can tell you here is ſo many Acres;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but he that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth
them knowes the goodneſſe of them, the worth
of them, and improveth them to his owne good. And
ſo it is with many, they can meaſure the points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and define, and divide them; I but the poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
can taſte, can feele them, can reliſh and improve
them: his knowledge is a knowledge with intereſt, but
other mens knowledge is a knowledge with no intereſt
or experience at all: So that there is naturally a vaile
of ignorance on the heart of every naturall man.</p>
            <p>Chriſtianity is a myſtery; till converſion there is a
myſtery in every point of Religion: none know what
repentance is, but a repentant ſinner; all the bookes in
the world cannot informe the heart what ſin is, or what
ſorrow is. A ſicke man knoweth what a diſeaſe is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then all Phyſicians, for he feeleth it; no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what faith is but the true believer: there is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
alſo in love. Godlineſſe is called a myſtery, not
onely for the notionall, but the practicall part of it; why
doe not men more ſolace themſelves in the tranſcendent
things of Religion, which may raviſh Angels. Alas,
there is a vaile over their ſoule, that they doe not know
them, or not experimentally they have no taſte or feeling
of them.</p>
            <p>And ſo there is a vaile of unbeliefe;<note place="margin">There is a vaile of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe over the unregenerate.</note> there is no man
without grace, that believeth truly what he knoweth,
but he believeth in the generall onely, he beleeveth
things ſo farre forth, as they croſſe not his luſts. But
when particular truths are inforced on a carnall man,
his luſts doe overbeare all his knowledge, and he hath a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117791:29"/>
ſecret ſcorne ariſing in his heart, whereby he derideth
thoſe truths, and goeth againſt them, and makes him
thinke certainly theſe be not true, and therefore he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth
them not. If a man by nature beleeved
the truths he ſaith he knoweth, he would not goe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
againſt them: But the ground of this is, there is
a miſt of ſinnefull luſts that are raiſed out of the ſoule,
that darkens the ſoule, that at the preſent time the ſoule
is atheiſticall, and full of unbeliefe; for there is no ſin
but ignorance and unbeliefe breatheth it into the ſoule,
and maketh way for it; For if a man knew what he
were about, and apprehended that God ſaw him, and
the danger of it,<note place="margin">Ignorance and unbeliefe act in all ſinnes.</note> he would never ſinne. There is no
ſinne without an error in judgement, there is a vaile of
ignorance and unbeliefe; what creature will run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a pit when he ſeeth it open? what creature will runne
into the fire, the moſt dull creature? Man will not run
into that danger that is open to the eye of the ſoule,
if there were not a vaile of ignorance, at leaſt unbeliefe,
at that time upon the ſoule. <hi>All ſinne ſuppoſeth er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this ſhould make us hate ſinne the more, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
we ſinne, ſpecially againſt our conſcience; there
is atheiſme in the ſoule at that time, and there is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe:
we beleeve not truth it ſelf; no ſinner but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
truth into queſtion: when he ſinneth, he denieth it,
or queſtioneth it; and therefore there is a vaile on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man naturally over his heart by ignorance and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.
The truths themſelves are cleare, God is cleare,
and the Goſpel is light, <hi>Mens, Lux,</hi> you know they
know things in the object, but in us there is darkeneſſe
in our underſtandings; and therefore the Scripture ſaith
not, wee are <hi>darke</hi> onely, but <hi>darkneſſe it ſelfe.</hi> The
clouds that ariſe, are like the miſts that doe interpoſe
between our ſoules, and divine things, ariſing from our
own hearts; &amp; the love of ſinfull things raiſe ſuch a cloud,
that we know not, or elſe believe not what is ſpoken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:117791:30"/>
To proceed,<note place="margin">2. Obſer.</note> God onely can reveale and take away
the vaile of ignorance,<note place="margin">God only can take off the vaile of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe.</note> and unbeliefe from off the
ſoule: I will ſpeake ſpecially of this vaile. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, there is ſuch a naturall unſuitableneſſe between
the ſoule and heavenly light, and heavenly truths, that
unleſſe God opens the eye of the ſoule,<note place="margin">Reaſ.</note> and puts a new
eye into the ſoule,<note place="margin">Becauſe of the unſuitablenes between the ſoule and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things.</note> it can never know or diſcerne of
heavenly things; there muſt be an eye ſuitable to the
light, elſe there will never be ſight of it. Now God can
create a new ſpirituall eye to diſcerne of ſpirituall things,
which a naturall eye cannot; who can ſee things inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
Divine things are inviſible to naturall eyes, there
is no ſuitableneſſe: he that muſt reveale theſe, and take
away the vaile, muſt create new light within, as well as a
light without; now God, and only God, that created light
out of darkneſſe, can create light in the ſoule. <hi>Let there
be light.</hi> Hee only can create a ſpirituall eye, to ſee the
things that to nature are viſible.</p>
            <p>There be four things in ſight.<note place="margin">Foure things. required in ſight.</note> 1. The object to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.
2. The light that conveyeth it. 3. The organ
that receiveth it. 4. And the light of the eye to meet
the light without. So it is in the ſoule together with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
truths, there muſt be light to diſcover them; for
light is the firſt viſible thing that diſcovers it ſelfe and all
things elſe: And then there muſt be a light in the ſoule
to judge of them, and this light muſt be ſuitable. A car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
baſe ſpirit judgeth of ſpirituall things carnally, like
himſelfe, becauſe he hath not light in his owne ſpirit:
The things are ſpirituall, his eye is carnall, he hath not
a light in his eye ſuitable to the object, and therefore
he cannot judge of them; for the Scripture ſaith plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they are ſpiritually diſcerned. Therefore a carnall
perſon hath carnall conceptions of ſpirituall things, as
an holy man doth ſpiritualize things by a ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of them.<note place="margin">Foure degrees of diſcerning things.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There be degrees of diſcerning things. The higheſt
degree is to ſee things face to face as they be in heaven;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:117791:30"/>
The next to that is to ſee them in a glaſſe: for there I
ſee the motion and true ſpecies of a man, though not
ſo clearly, as when I ſee him face to face; therefore We
ſoone forget the ſpecies of it in a glaſſe. Wee have more
fixedneſſe of the other, becauſe there is more reality: We
ſee things put into Water, and that is leſſe; but then
there is a ſight of man in Pictures, which is leſſe than the
reſt, becauſe we ſee not the motion. It is even ſo, a
carnall man ſcarce ſees the dead reſemblance of things.
In <hi>Moſes</hi> time, they ſaw things in water as it were blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
though true: but we ſee things in a glaſſe of truth, as
clearly as poſſibly we can in this world. In heaven wee
ſhall ſee face to face, ſhall ſee him as he is: And then will
be the joy of this excellent Feaſt, and the conſummation
of all ſweet promiſes, which here we can but have a
taſte of.</p>
            <p>So that is the firſt reaſon of it,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> that God is onely
the taker away of the vaile, which ariſeth from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitableneſſe
between the ſoule, and divine Truths. There
is nothing in the heart of man, but a contrariety to divine
light. The very naturall knowledge, that is contrary, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Conſcience that onely checketh for groſſe ſinnes,
but not for ſpirituall ſinnes: Obedience and Civill
life, that makes a man full of pride, and armeth him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſelfe-denyall, and againſt the righteouſneſſe of
Chriſt, and Juſtification. There is nothing in the ſoule,
but (without grace) riſeth againſt the ſoule in divine
things.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 3.</note> there is ſuch diſproportion between the ſoule
being full of ſinne,<note place="margin">And a diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion alſo.</note> and guiltineſſe, and heavenly things,
that are ſo great, that the heart of man will not believe,
unleſſe God convinceth the ſoule, that God is ſo good
and gracious, though they be great and excellent, yet
God will beſtow them upon our ſoules, and therefore he
ſendeth the Spirit, that over-powers the ſoule, though
it bee full of feare, and guilt, that ſinne contracts.</p>
            <p>Though we be never ſo unworthy, he will magnifie
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117791:31"/>
his grace to poore ſinners, and without that the ſoule
will never believe, there is ſuch an infinite diſproportion
betweene the ſoule and the things, between the ſinfull
ſoule and the ſpirit, ſo that God muſt over-power the
ſoule to make it believe.</p>
            <p>The Scripture is full of this: As we are naturally igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and full of unbeliefe: ſo God onely can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power
the ſoule, and take away the vaile of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>All the Angels in heaven,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 4.</note> and all the Creatures in the
world,<note place="margin">No creature, Angels or men can bring light into the ſoule.</note> the moſt skilfull men in the world cannot bring
light into the ſoule, they cannot bring light into
the heart; they can ſpeake of divine things, but
they underſtand them little, but to bring light into the
heart, that the heart may taſte of them, and yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to believe, that they cannot doe. And therefore all
Gods children they bee <hi>Theodidactoi,</hi> taught of God;
God onely hath the privilege to teach the heart, to bend
and bow the heart to believe.</p>
            <p>So that God onely by his Spirit takes away the vaile of
ignorance and unbeliefe.</p>
            <p>Now the third thing is,<note place="margin">3 Obſ.</note> that this is peculiar to the
Church,<note place="margin">Its peculiar to the Church to have the vaile taken away.</note> and to the Children of God, to have the vaile
taken off. In this Mountaine, ſaith the Scripture, the
vail of all Faces ſhall be ſwallowed up, or taken away.</p>
            <p>I partly ſhewed in the former point, that it is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to Gods Children to have the vaile taken off. There
is a vailin all things, either the things be hid from them,
as amongſt the Gentiles, or if the things bee revealed,
there is a vaile upon the heart, their luſts raiſe up a cloud,
which untill God ſubdue by the holy Spirit, they bee
darke, yea darkneſſe it ſelfe. <hi>Goſhen</hi> was onely light,
when all <hi>Egypt</hi> was in darkneſſe: ſo there is light onely
in the Church, and all other parts in the world are in
darkneſſe: And amongſt men in the Church there is a
darkneſſe upon the ſoule of unregenerate men, that bee
not ſanctified, and ſubdued by the Spirit of God. And
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:117791:31"/>
all godly men are lightſome, nay they be lights in the
world. As wicked men are darkneſſe, ſo gracious men
by the Spirit of God, are made lights of the world from
him that is the true light, Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
            <p>It is peculiar to the Church to know the greateſt good,<note place="margin">Its peculiar to the Church to know the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt good, and greateſt evill.</note>
and the greateſt evill. It is no where but in the Church,
who are the people of God. None but Gods Elect can
know the greateſt evill, that is ſinne, which the Spirit of
God revealeth: And the greateſt good, that is Gods
mercy in Chriſt, and ſanctifying grace. The ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
doth both: As light doth diſcover foul things, as well
as faire; ſo the ſame Spirit of God diſcovers the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſſe
of ſinne, and the ſweetneſſe of grace. Where
the one is, there is never the other; where there is not
truely a deep diſcerning of ſinne, there is never know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of grace; there is none but in the Church, thoſe
that have the Spirit of illumination, they have ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
likewiſe.</p>
            <p>We ſhall make uſe of all together. You ſee then what
naturally we are, and that Gods grace muſt take away
the vaile, and this is from all them within the Church,
and in the Church thoſe whom God is pleaſed to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place.<note place="margin">4 Obſ.</note> Where this vaile is taken off from
any,<note place="margin">Where the vaile is taken away, there is ſpirituall joy and feaſting.</note> there is with it ſpirituall joy, and feaſting, as here he
joyneth them both together. I will make a feaſt of fat
things, and will take away the vaile.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of the connexion of this, is that ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">Reaſon.</note>
that is a Spirit of Revelations, is a Spirit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:<note place="margin">The ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is a Spirit of Revelation and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
And the ſame Spirit that is the Spirit of Comfort, is
a Spirit of Revelation: All ſweetneſſe that the ſoule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth,
commeth from light, and all light that is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
conveyeth ſweetneſſe both together. Beloved, there
is a marvailous ſweetneſſe in divine Truths, in Chriſt is
all marrow, and in Religion forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and
inward peace, and joy, and grace, fitting us to be like
to Chriſt, and for heaven, they be incredibly ſweet, they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:117791:32"/>
bee all marrow. I but they are onely ſo to them that
know them; now Gods Spirit that revealeth theſe
things to us, doth breed a taſte in the ſoule. The Spirit
of illumination of Gods Children is a Spirit of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
likewiſe; and that ſanctification alters the taſte,
and reliſh of the will and affections, that with diſcovery
of theſe things, there is a taſte, and reliſh of them. It is
<hi>ſapida Scientia,</hi> a ſavory knowledge they have: And
therefore where he maketh a Feaſt, he taketh away the
vaile; and where hee takes away the vaile hee makes a
Feaſt: what a wonderfull ſatisfaction hath the ſoule,
when the vaile is taken off, to ſee God in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
to ſee ſin pardoned, to ſee the beginnings of grace,
which ſhall bee finiſhed, and accompliſhed in glory, to
diſcerne that peace which paſſeth underſtanding, &amp;c.
What a marvellous ſweetneſſe are in theſe things?</p>
            <p>They cannot be revealed to the knowledge ſpiritually,
but there is a Feaſt in the ſoule, wherein the ſoule doth ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
it ſelfe; ſo both theſe goe together.</p>
            <p>And therefore we ſhould not reſt in that revealing
that doth not bring a ſavor with it to the ſoule; undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
that knowledge hath no ſolace and comfort for the
ſoule that is not by divine Revelation of heavenly
truths.</p>
            <p>We ſee the dependence of theſe one upon another:
Then let us make this Uſe of all.</p>
            <p>Since there is a vail over all men by nature,<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> the work
of ignorance and unbeliefe,<note place="margin">To labour to have this vaile taken off.</note> and ſince God onely taketh it
away by his Holy Spirit, and ſince that onely thoſe that
be godly and ſanctified have this taken off: While this is,
there is a ſpirituall feaſt, joy, and comfort, and ſtrength;
then let us labour to have this vaile taken off, let us la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour
to have the eyes of our underſtandings enlightned
to have our hearts ſubdued to believe, let us take notice
of our naturall condition. We are drowned and inwarpt
in darkneſſe, the beſt of us all: It is not having know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
what wee are by nature, it is not any knowledge
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:117791:32"/>
that can bring us to heaven, there muſt be a revelation,
a taking away of the vaile. How many content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with common light of Education and traditionary
knowledge; ſo they were bred and catechized, and under
ſuch a Miniſtery, but for ſpirituall knowledge of ſpirituall
things, how little is it cared for; And yet this is neceſſary
to ſalvation. There is great occaſion to preſie this, that
we reſt not in common knowledge. If Religion be not
knowne to purpoſe, its like Lightning, which directs not
a man in his way, but dazles him, and puts him quite out
of his way. Many have flaſhes of knowledge that affect
them a little: but this affection is ſoon gone, and directs
them not a whit in the wayes of life; and therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
that the will and affections may be ſubject. Beg
of God a fleſhy heart, an heart yeelding to the truth. We
know eare-truths will harden; as none is harder than a
common formall Chriſtian. A man had better fall into
the hands of Papiſts, than into the hands of a formall hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall
Chriſtian. Why? they pride themſelves in
their profeſſion. No Perſecuters worſe than the Scribes
and Phariſees, that ſtood in their own light. They were
more cruell than <hi>Pilate:</hi> And therefore if wee bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
but not truly transformed; to love the truth
we know, and hate the evill we know, it maketh us
worſe.</p>
            <p>And then it inrageth men the more: The more they
know, the more they be enraged. Men when truths be
preſt, which they purpoſe not to obey, they fret againſt
the Ordinance, and caſt ſtones, as it were in the face of
truth. When Phyſick doth raiſe humors, but is not ſtrong
enough to carry them away, they indanger the body;
And where light is not ſtrong enough to diſpell corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
when it raiſeth corruption, it inrageth it. When men
know Truth and are not moulded into it, they firſt rage
againſt it, and then by little and little fall from it, and
grow extreme enemies to it. Its a dangerous thing
therefore to reſt in naked knowledge. Beg then of God
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:117791:33"/>
that he would take away the vaile of ignorance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe,
that light and life may goe together, and ſo wee
ſhall be fit to feaſt with the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now that we may have true ſaving knowledge, firſt we
muſt attend meekly upon Gods Ordinances, which be
ſanctified to this end to let in light to the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Will we know ſinne and our ſtate by nature,<note place="margin">Meanes.</note> and how
to come out of it,<note place="margin">For this wee muſt attend on Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> then together with this Revelation
muſt come an heavenly ſtrength into the ſoule, a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taſte, and reliſh, and therefore attend upon the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;
And labour for an humble ſoule, empty of our
ſelves; And doe not think to break into heavenly things
with ſtrength of parts, God muſt reveal, God muſt take
away the vaile only by his holy Spirit in the Ordinance.
The vaile is taken away from the oject, in opening of
Truths; but the vaile muſt bee taken away from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and from the heart too, there muſt bee knowledge
of the object, as well as an object; the object muſt bee
ſanctified, and fitted to the perſons, elſe divine Truths
will never be underſtood divinely, nor ſpirituall Truths
ſpiritually: Labour to be emptied of your ſelves. In what
meaſure we are emptied of our ſelf-conceitedneſſe, and
underſtanding, wee bee fill'd in divine things: in what
meaſure we are emptied of our ſelves, we are filled with
the Spirit of God, and knowledge, and grace. As a
veſſell in what meaſure it is emptied,<note place="margin">Smile.</note> in that meaſure it
is fit to be fill'd with more ſupervenient liquor: ſo in
what meaſure we grow in ſelf-denyall, and humility, in
that meaſure wee are filled likewiſe with knowledge.
He will teach an humble ſoule that ſtands not in its own
light, what it is to repent, to believe, to love; what it is
to be patient under the Croſſe, what it is to live holily,
and dye comfortably. The Spirit of God will teach an
humble ſelfe-denying ſoule all theſe things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
labour for an humble empty ſoule, and not to caſt
our ſelves too much into the ſinnes, and faſhions of the
times; As the Apoſtle <hi>Rom. 12. Be not conformed to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117791:33"/>
this world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Faſhion not our ſelves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the times.</note> 
               <hi>but be yee transformed by the renewing of your
minde, &amp;c.</hi> When a man caſteth himſelfe into the mould
of the times, and will live as the reſt doe, he ſhall never
underſtand the ſecrets of God, and the good pleaſure of
God; for the world muſt be condemned. The world
goeth the broad way: And therefore we muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what others doe, but what God teacheth us to do.
And adde to this;<note place="margin">4. Be carefull to practiſe what we know</note> What we know, let us labour to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
<hi>Iohn 7. 17. But he that doth the will of my Father,

heart affect them, leſt God giveth us up to believe lies.
We have many given up to this ſinne, becauſe when
truths are revealed, they give way to their owne proud
ſcornfull hearts, they know not the love of the truth.
God knoweth what a jewell the Truth is, and ſince they
deſpiſe it, God giveth them up to believe lies: and take
heed, practice what we know, and love what we know,
entertaine it with a loving affection.</p>
            <p>A loving affection is the Casket of this jewell, if
we entertain it not in love, it removes from us its Station,
and being gone, God will remove us into darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>And remember it is God that taketh away the vaile
of ignorance and unbeliefe: And therefore make this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:117791:34"/>
uſe of it,<note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> to make our Studies, and Cloſets, Oratories, not
to come to Divine Truths,<note place="margin">Make our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets Oratories for the getting of knowledge.</note> to out-wraſtle the excellency

you have <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. Open mine eyes, and reveale thy
truth. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth for the Spirit of Revelation,
1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 19. And ſo deſire God to reveale, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the vaile from us, that he will open divine Truths
to our ſoules; that ſince he hath the Key of <hi>David,</hi> that
opens, and no man ſhutteth, that he would open our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
to conceive things, and our hearts to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
He hath the onely Key of the ſoule, we can ſhut
our ſouls,<note place="margin">We can ſhut, but not open our hearts to divine truths.</note> but cannot open them againe: ſo we can ſhut
our hearts to divine Truths, we can naturally doe this, but
open them without the help of the Spirit we cannot: He
can open our underſtandings, as he did the Diſciples: He
can open our Hearts to believe, he can doe it, and will do
it. If we ſeek to him, he will not put back the humble
deſires of them that feare him; And therefore for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
light and heavenly revelation, all the teaching of
the men of the world cannot do it. If we know no more
than wee can have by Bookes, and men that teach us,
wee ſhall never come to Heaven; but wee muſt have
God teach the heart, as well as the Braine, hee muſt
teach not onely the Truths themſelves, as they bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
but the love of them, the faith in them, the
practice of them, and hee onely can doe this, hee on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
can teach the heart, hee onely can diſcover the bent
of the heart, and Satans wiles that caſt a cloud upon the
underſtanding, the Spirit onely can doe it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in all our endeavours labour to get knowledge, and
joyne holineſſe and divine grace, and pray to God that
he would reveale the myſtery of ſalvation to us.</p>
            <p>But how ſhall we know whether we have this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
light and revelation,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> or no? Whether the vaile

the goodneſſe of God, a wondering at the things of
faith: And the ſoule ſets ſuch a price upon divine things,
that all is dung and droſſe in compariſon of the excellent
knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore is it that thou
wilt reveale thy ſelfe to us, and not unto the world? as
admiring the goodneſſe of God. What are we? what
am I? that God ſhould reveale theſe things to me, and
not to the world? that many periſh in darkenſſe and
ſhadow of death, though they heare of divine things; yet
they teaching rebellion and unbeleife, are not moulded
to them, and ſo periſh eternally. There is a ſecret ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of the goodneſſe of God to the poore ſoule, and
a wonderment at ſpirituall things. Oh how ſweet is
thy law ſaith <hi>David.</hi> And teach me the wonders of thy
law, and joy unſpeakable, and glorious, and peace that

by the taſte of what they have, they wonder at that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and at that they looke for, and are carried with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

they that have any ſpirituall knowledge, they be carried
to grow more and more,<note place="margin">2. By being carried with deſire to know more and more.</note> and to enter further and

a deſire ſtill till they come to the full meaſure that is to be
had in Jeſus Chriſt, there is no knowledge at all: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a gracious ſoule when once it ſees, it deſires ſtill
to feele the power and vertue of Chriſt in it, as <hi>Paul</hi>
counted all dung in compariſon of this knowledge to

walk ſtill to the high price of Gods calling, and where
that is not, no grace is begun.</p>
            <p>And againe, where divine light is, and the vaile ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

by his owne inſtruments and meanes, and they be able
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:117791:35"/>
to juſtifie all courſes of wiſdome, <hi>Wiſdome is juſtified of
her children.</hi> By experience they be able to ſay the
word is the word; I have found it caſting me downe,
and raiſing me up, and ſearching the hidden corners of
my heart. I have found Gods Ordinances powerfull,
the word and Sacrament. I have found my hope, faith,
ſtrength, and ſpirituall comfort, and therefore I can
juſtifie them; for I have found, taſted, and reliſhed of
theſe things; which worketh that upon the ſoule
which Chriſt did on the body. I finde mine eyes, I
finde my deafe eares opened. I can heare with another
reliſh then before. I finde a life and quickning to good
things, though it be weake; I had no life at all to them
before. I find a reliſh which I knew not before; So
that there be ſpirituall ſenſes whereby I am able to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that theſe things be the things of God: So that
they that have divine truths, can juſtifie all the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God, by their owne experience. As <hi>Peter</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
when Chriſt asked him, will you be alſo gone?
be gone ſaid <hi>Peter, Whether ſhould we goe, thou haſt the
words of eternall life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have found thy words efficacious to comfort and
ſtrengthen, and raiſe, and ſhall I depart from thee, who
haſt the words of eternall life? And ſo take a ſoule that
the ſpirit of God hath wrought upon; aske whether they
will be careleſſe of meanes of ſalvation, not to pray, or
heare, or receive the Sacrament, by theſe have I eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

and ſtrength, and joy, and ſhall I leave theſe things? no,
I will not; whether ſhall I goe, thou haſt the words of
eternall life? Are we able to juſtifie theſe things by the
ſweetneſſe wee have found in them? then certainly God
hath ſhined upon the ſoule, and together with ſtrength
and light,<note place="margin">Fourthly, When our knowledge worketh upon us.</note> conveyed ſweetneſſe to the ſoule.</p>
            <p>A godly man ſeeth things with life, his ſight worketh

wee all behold the glory of God and are changed. Sight
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:117791:35"/>
of light and life goeth together with a chriſtian; as Chriſt
ſaith, he is the light of the world, and the life of the
world. Firſt light, for life commeth with light, and
light conveyeth life: All grace is dropt into the will
through the underſtanding; and whereſoever Chriſt is
life, he is light, becauſe true knowledge is a transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

hidden love, which is not ſeen with the eyes of the body;
they may ſee and taſte, and reliſh his love and goodneſſe
in Jeſus Chriſt: that as the outward man is refreſhed
with the elements, ſo the inward man may be refreſhed
with his ſpirit, that they may be effectuall to us; that
we may juſtifie the courſe God takes ſo farre, as to come
charitably, and joyfully to them.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have heretofore at large ſpoken of the
ſpirituall and eternall favors of God,
ſet out in the former Verſe, <hi>In this
Mountain will the Lord of Hoſts make
a Feaſt of fat things.</hi> While our ſoule
is in the body it is much guided by our
fancy: ſpirituall things are therefore
preſented by outward, and conveyed to the ſoule that
way; onely we muſt remember that there is a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
excellency in the things themſelves, than in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation;
for what is all Banquets, fatneſſe with
Marrow, Wine on the Lees, to the joy and ſweetneſſe of
Religion, begun here, and accompliſhed in the world

            <p>In Chriſt there is nothing but all Marrow, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in Religion, that may refreſh a man in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:117791:36"/>
condition, if hee can but have a taſte of it.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe the ſpirituall things of Chriſt doe us no
good, as long as they are hid, therefore the Holy Ghoſt
ſetteth downe a Promiſe, <hi>That God will take away the
covering cast on all people, and the vaile ſpread over all
Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there be ſome things that will dampe all mirth:
Now here is ſecurity againſt them, that our joy may bee
compleat; and this in the next verſe to which I now
come; <hi>Hee will ſwallow up death in victory, hee will
wipe away teares from all faces.</hi> The Prophet having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of a great Feaſt before, an excellent Feaſt, ſets
forth here the ſervices of that feaſt; what is it that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies
it.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all there ſhall be light to diſcover the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the feaſt, the vaile is taken away, and a
knowledge given to know divine things in a ſpirituall
manner.</p>
            <p>Then (which will damp all feaſts) the feare of death
is taken away; <hi>He will ſwallow up death in victory, and
wipe away all tears,</hi> that is all ſorrow, the effect is put for
the cauſe: This is an excellent promiſe, an excellent
Service in this ſpirituall banquet. Suppoſe a man were ſet
at a Feaſt furniſhed with all Delicates, royally attended,
Cloaths ſuitable, and had a Sword hung over his head
ready to fall upon him, it would caſt ſuch a dampe on his
ſpirit, as would ſpoile the joy of this feaſt: So to heare
of Spirituall excellencies, and yet death, and hell, and
damnation comming along, alas where is the comfort you
ſpeake of? And therefore to make the feaſt more perfect,
there is not onely light and knowledge, but removall of
it ever may dampe the feaſt. So this muſt needs come
in to comfort all the reſt; <hi>He ſhall ſwallow up death in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and wipe away tears from all faces.</hi> Death is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to us under the word victory, as a Combatant,
as one that we are to fight withall, a Captaine.</p>
            <p>And then here is the victory of him, Chriſt overcomes
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:117791:37"/>
him, and overcomes him gloriouſly: It is not onely a
Conqueſt, but a ſwallowing of him up. Uſually God u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
all ſorts of enemies in their owne kinde; he cauſeth
them that ſpoile, to be ſpoyled; them that ſwallow up, to
be ſwallowed up: So Death the great ſwallower ſhall
be ſwallowed up.</p>
            <p>Beloved,<note place="margin">Death is the great King of Kings.</note> Death is the great King of Kings, and the
Emperor of Emperors, the great Captaine, and ruling
King of the world; for no King hath ſuch Dominion as
Death hath, it ſpreads its government and victory over
all Nations; he is equall, though a Tyrant. As a Tyrant
ſpares none, he is equall in this, he ſubdueth young and
old,<note place="margin">Death ſpares none.</note> poore and rich, he levels Scepters and Spades toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
he levels all; there is no difference between the
duſt of an Emperor and the meaneſt man; he is a Tyrant
that governeth over all; And ſo there is this equity in
him, he ſpares none.</p>
            <p>He hath continued from the beginning of the world
to this time;<note place="margin">Death hath continued from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, let in by ſin.</note> but he is a Tyrant brought in by our ſelves,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Sin let in Death, it opened the doore: death
is no Creature of Gods making; Satan brought in ſin,
and ſinne brought in death: So that we be acceſſary our
ſelves to the powerfull ſtroak of this prevailing Tyrant;
And therefore ſinne is called the cauſe of death. Sinne
brought in death,<note place="margin">Sin armeth Death.</note> and armeth death; the weapon that
death fights with, and cauſeth great terror, it is ſinne:
The cauſe is armed with the power of the wrath of God
for ſinne, the feare of hell, and damnation; So that wrath,
and hell, and damnation, arming ſinne, it bringeth a ſting
of it ſelf, and put as venome into death. All cares, and
feares, and ſorrowes, and ſickneſſes, are leſſe and petty
deaths, harbingers to death it ſelfe; but the attendants
that follow this great King are worſt of all: As <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.
I ſaw a pale horſe,<note place="margin">Hel the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of death.</note> and death upon it, and after him comes
hell: what were death, if it were not for the Pit, and
Dungeon that followeth it? So that death is attended
with hell, and hell with eternity. Therefore here is a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:117791:37"/>
ſtrange kind of prevailing. There is no victory where
there is no enemy, and therefore death muſt needs be an
enemy, yea it is the worſt enemy, and the laſt enemy:
Death is not planted in the forlorne hope, but it is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at laſt for the greateſt advantage, and is a great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
what doth death? It depriveth us of all comfort,
pleaſure, communion with one another in this life, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
or whatſoever elſe is comfortable. The grave is the
houſe of oblivion; Death is terrible of it ſelfe, even to
nature, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, where it is not ſwallowed
up of Chriſt: for it is an evill in it ſelfe, and as I
ſaid, armed with a ſting of ſinne, after which followes
Hell.</p>
            <p>Now this death is ſwallowed up. When the Scripture
puts a perſon upon death, it is not uncomly for us to ſpeak
as the Scripture doth: The Scripture puts a perſouup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
death, and a kind of triumphing ſpirit in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
over death: Oh death where is thy ſting, oh grave
where is thy victory; death is the greateſt ſwallower,
and yet it is ſwallowed up by Chriſt; death hath ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up all, and when it hath ſwallowed up, it kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
them; It keeps the duſt of Kings, Subjects, great and
ſmall, to the generall day of judgement, when death
ſhall be ſwallowed up of it ſelfe. It is therefore of the
nature of thoſe that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, that cry, give, give,
and yet is never ſatisfied, like the grave, yet this death is
ſwallowed up in victory.</p>
            <p>But how commeth death to be ſwallowed up?<note place="margin">Chriſt ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows up death in victory, for himſelfe and his.</note> Chriſt
will ſwallow up death in victory, for himſelfe and his.
Firſt of all, becauſe ſin brought in death, our Saviour
Chriſt became ſinne, a ſacrifice to his fathers juſtice for
ſinne;<note place="margin">Reaſ.</note> he was made ſinne for us, he was made a curſe
for us,<note place="margin">Becauſe hee hath ſatisfied for ſin.</note> to take away the curſe due to us: and ſinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken away, what hath death to doe with us, and
hell, and damnation, the attendants on death? nothing
at all; Therefore <hi>Coll.</hi> 2. upon the croſſe Chriſt did
naile the law, and ſinne, and the devill; there he raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:117791:38"/>
over principalities and powers, which were but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners
let looſe by reaſon of our ſinnes: And God
being ſatisfied for ſinne, the devill hath nothing to doe
with us, but to exerciſe us, except it be for our good:
So that he hath ſwallowed up death, becauſe by his death
he hath taken away ſinne, and ſo the power of Satan,
whoſe power is by ſinne. And therefore it is excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſet downe <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. He alſo tooke part of fleſh
and blood, that through death he might deſtroy him
that had the power of death, that is, the devill: So
Chriſt by death overthrew Satan, that had the power of
death; becauſe by death he tooke away ſinne, the ſinnes
of all, and bare our ſinnes upon the croſſe, and was made
ſinne for us that knew no ſinne; he is ours, if we believe:
For then Chriſt is given to a particular man when hee
believes. Beloved, Chriſt upon the croſſe did triumph
over all our ſpirituall enemies, ſinne, and death, and all;
It was a kingdome of patience.<note place="margin">A double kingdome of Chriſt.</note> You know there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
kingdome of Chriſt; a kingdome of patience, and a
kingdome of power: Chriſt on the croſſe ſuffering pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
due to ſinne,<note place="margin">1. A kingdom of patience.</note> overcame the law, and the devill,
and ſinne, which is the kingdome of patience; the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of power he hath in heaven.<note place="margin">2. A kingdom of power.</note> If Chriſt were ſo
able in his kingdome of patience to conquer our greateſt
enemies, what will he doe in his kingdome of power?
As <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoneth <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. If by his death we are ſaved,
much more now he triumphs in heaven, and appeares
for us, is he able to convey greater matters to us.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt in the daies of his fleſh did conquer,<note place="margin">Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quereth for us and in us.</note> how
glorious will his conqueſt be at the day of judgement.
Now Chriſt hath conquered all in his owne perſon, as
our head, then he will conquer for us in his myſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
what is now done in his perſon, ſhall be done in
his members. In the meane time, faith is our victory,
his conqueſt over death our victory, his victory over all
our ſpirituall enemies, is our victory; every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,
is a conquerour of death, though he die, becauſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:117791:38"/>
he ſees it conquered in Chriſt his head: and as it is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conquered in him, ſo Chriſt will conquer it in all his
members; For as Chriſt in his naturall body is gone to
heaven there to appeare in our behalfe, ſo ſhall myſticall
Chriſt be wholly in glory; he will not leave a finger, we
ſhall all triumph over all our ſpirituall enemies; as Chriſts
naturall body is glorious in heaven as our head, ſo ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
his myſticall body be.</p>
            <p>You ſee then how death is ſwallowed up by Chriſt
as our ſurety, as the ſecond Adam upon the croſſe; and
truly ſwallowed up in him, and by faith this victory is
ours, and time will come when in our owne perſons it
ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory.</p>
            <p>This might be inlarged, but I haſte to make uſe of
it.</p>
            <p>Marke I beſeech you how death is ſwallowed up by
Chriſt in his owne perſon for our good,<note place="margin">Death was conquered by Chriſt when he had given way to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of it.</note> he gave a great
way to death, for death ſeiſed on him upon the croſſe,
death ſevereth ſoule from body, death had him in his
owne cabinet, his grave for three daies; nay this great
King and tyrant death, had a great conqueſt over Chriſt
himſelfe; but here was the glory of this victory; when
death this great conquerour of the world had Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the croſſe, and in his owne dominion, in the grave,
where he rules and raignes, conſuming and ſwallowing
up all, death was faine to give up all, and Satan thought
to have had a great morſell when he devoured Chriſt; but
there was an hooke in his divine power that catched
him, that when he thought to have ſwallowed up Chriſt
was ſwallowed up himſelfe, his head was then broken;
he never had ſuch a blow, as by Chriſt on the croſſe, when
he was overcome being a ſcorne of the world viſibly, yet
inviſibly in Gods acceptation of that ſacrifice, and in a
ſpirit of faith: Chriſt triumpheth over Satan, death was
ſubdued even in his owne kingdome, and that makes the
victory great.</p>
            <p>Death by ſeiſing on Chriſt without right, Chriſt hath
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:117791:39"/>
freed us from the evill of death when it had right to us:
Death hath loſt all its right by faſtening on Chriſt, and ſo
is become as a Drone without a ſting; ſo the great ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
of all is ſwallowed up it ſelfe at laſt by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now for comfortable uſe of it.<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> Firſt, let us conſider
that God oftentimes giveth a great deale of way to his
greateſt enemies:<note place="margin">Firſt, we ſee God gives way to his enemies for a time, when he will give glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious victory.</note> God uſeth a ſtratagem of retiring,
he ſeemes to retire and give liberty to his enemies, but it
is to triumph and trample upon them with greater
ſhame, he will tread them to duſt afterward; Chriſt
gave death a great deale of liberty, he was crucified
and tormented, then had to the grave, and there he lay:
And this was to raiſe a greater triumph over this great
prevailer, over the world and death it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>It is continued ſo in the Church: Doth not he give way
to the enemies of the Church, they may come to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hah,
ahah, ſo would we have it. Now the poore chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God are where we would have them, but then
comes ſuddaine deſtruction: God to make his victory
more glorious, and more to diſcover their cruelty, comes
upon them when they be in the top of pleaſure, and
the Church in the bottome of abaſement; then God
ſwalloweth up all in victory, as Chriſt did death when
it ſeemed to have bin it ſelfe victorious.</p>
            <p>This is a very comfortable conſideration, for if death
be overcome when it ſeem'd to overcome Chriſt, what
need wee feare any other enemy? Chriſt hath broken
the net as an Eagle or great bird, and the reſt eſcape by
him.</p>
            <p>You may inlarge this in your owne meditations: hee
will ſwallow up death in victory, this is ſaid for the time

ſo it is in our head. Were it not comfortable now to
all true hearted Chriſtians, to heare that the Church
fareth better, and that the enemies were ſwallowed up,
for they be but the inſtruments of this inferiour death; let
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:117791:39"/>
us get the ſpirit of faith and ſee them all conquered, for
certainly they ſhall have the worſt at laſt. He that
hath ſwallowed up death in victory, will ſwallow up all
that be the cauſe of death: And therefore the Scripture
ſpeaks of theſe things as paſt, <hi>Babilon</hi> is fallen, as a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
caſt into the bottome of the Sea.</p>
            <p>Get a ſpirit of faith, and wee ſhall never be much
troubled with <hi>Babilon;</hi> for all the enemies of Chriſt,
and adherents to that man of ſinne muſt downe, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the judgement threatned in the <hi>Revelations;</hi>
Heaven hath concluded it, and all the policy of <hi>Rome</hi>
and hell cannot diſanull it: they be already ſwallowed
up to faith, and Chriſt will rule till hee hath put them all
under his feet; which ſhall be done, not only to deſtroy
them, but to raiſe himſelfe higher, in giving them up to
their confuſion.</p>
            <p>Againe, if death be ſwallowed up in victory, labour
to be one with Chriſt crucified,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> for union with him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with union,<note place="margin">Labour to be one with Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> with Chriſt crucified. The firſt union
is with Chriſt abaſed, and then with Chriſt glorified:
And therefore labour to ſee ſinne that brought in death,
ſubdued by the power of Chriſts death in ſome meaſure,
and then wee ſhall have comfort in his death glorified.
For in my holy mount death is ſwallowed up, that is, the
true Church of Chriſt, labour to be members of Chriſt,
otherwiſe death will come as a tyrant indeed, armed
with a terrible ſting, in his full force to aſſaile you. It
is the moſt terrible thing to ſee death come armed with
the wrath and anger of God, and attended with hell
and damnation. Labour therefore to be one with Chriſt
crucified, to get our ſinnes crucified, and our ſelves
partakers of his death: and then no damnation, no
feare of death to them that are in Chriſt: they may die,
but they are freed from eternall death, and they ſhall
riſe againe even as Chriſts body roſe to glory.</p>
            <p>Get therefore into Chriſt and deſire the power of his
death ſubduing ſinne: In what meaſure we grow in that,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:117791:40"/>
wee grow in boldneſſe and joy, and whatſoever priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> when wee be in Chriſt, true members of
him,<note place="margin">Be thankfull to God for this victory in Chriſt.</note> then let us be thankfull to God for this victory,
thankfull to Jeſus Chriſt that hath given us victory;
when wee thinke of death, of ſinne, of judgement, of

fearfull things in the world as conquered enemies) ſay,
oh bleſſed be God for Chriſt, and bleſſed be Chriſt for
dying for us, and by death diſarming death of his ſting;
that now wee can thinke of it in our judgements quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;

it is a doore and paſſage to life; death is the death

till wee die, and when wee die, we are paſt feare of

though it takes us from comforts, and employments, and
friends here, yet it is a change to a better place, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
company, and better employments, and better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
to be in a glorious condition to eternity; and
therefore wee have cauſe to bleſſe God in Chriſt, that
tooke our nature, and in our nature diſarmed our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

the wrath of of God,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> and hell, and damnation. Oh we can
never be thankfull enough for this.<note place="margin">Let thoſe that are in Chriſt be aſhamed of the feare of death.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, if death be ſwallowed up in victory, let us
be aſhamed of the feare of death, becauſe Chriſt ſaith he

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:117791:40"/>
Shall wee be afraid of an enemy that is ſwallowed

holy mountaine death ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory,
and why ſhould we feare a conquered enemy, none will
feare an enemy that is conquered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But how came Chriſt to feare death, and we
not to fear?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt had to deale with death armed with a
terrible ſting, with ſinne, and the wrath of God for ſin:
And therefore when he was to die, <hi>Father let this cup
paſſe from me.</hi> But death is diſarmed to us: He had to
encounter with ſinne and the wrath of God, and death
in all its ſtrength. But we are not ſo: we are to deale
with death like the brazen Serpent, that hath the ſhape of
death, but no ſting at all; Its become a drone ever ſince
it loſt its ſting in Chriſt. <hi>(Life tooke death, that death
might take life)</hi> as he ſaid. The meaning is, Chriſts life
it ſelfe tooke death, that wee that were ſo ſubject to
death, that we were death it ſelfe, might take life. Oh
bleſſed conſideration, nothing comparable to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the death of Chriſt, it is the death of
deaths.</p>
            <p>And then againe wee are ſure of victory, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
in our head, and ſhall be in us. But you ſay wee
are to conflict with the pangs of death, and many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
meet in death. It is true, but it is conquered to
faith, and in Chriſt our head; we muſt fight, Chriſt trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
us to overcome death our ſelves by faith, and then
wee are ſure of victory. Joyne theſe two together, it
is conquered in Chriſt our head, and ſhall be conquered
of us; death keeps our duſt, and muſt give them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But in the mean time we die.</p>

            <p>Hee that hath been our Saviour in life, will be ſo to

for he ſendeth the devill to fetch them out of the world:
but for theſe that be his, he ſendeth his Angels to fetch
them, and he helps them in their combat: we muſt not
therefore feare overmuch. There is a naturall feare of
death, death wrought upon Chriſt himſelfe God-man;
not only death, but ſuch a death, he was to be left of his
Father, and lie under the ſenſe of the wrath of God, the
ſeperation of that ſoule from the body he tooke upon
him was terrible; and therefore he ſaith, If it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
let this cup paſſe from me; that was nature, and
without it he had not bin true man. But that I ſay, is,
that grace may be above nature; death is a time of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
it ſtrips us of earthly comforts, friends, callings,
imployments, but then comes the eye of faith to lay
hold on the victory of Chriſt in time to come, when
death ſhall be only ſwallowed up in victory, and then
the glorious ſtate to come, to which death bringeth us;
ſo that here faith muſt be above ſenſe, and grace above
nature, and therefore I beſeech you let us labour for
it.</p>
            <p>There be two ſorts of men to whom I would ſpeake a
little.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">They are fools that in a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bravery contemn death before diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Chriſt.</note> thoſe that in a kind of bravery ſeeme to ſlight
death; men of baſe ſpirits as we call them, fooles, vain-glorious
ſpirits, empty ſpirits. Is there any creature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
in Chriſt, able groundedly to ſlight ſo great an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
as death, armed with a ſting of ſinne, and attended
with hell and damnation? The Romiſh and divelliſh
ſpirits are terrible; but if thy ſinnes be not pardoned, it
is the moſt terrible thing in the world to die, for there
is a gulfe afterwards: what ſhall we ſay then, of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:117791:41"/>
Combatants that for vain-glory are prodigall of their
lives,<note place="margin">Of Duelliſt.</note> that for a foule word, a little diſgrace, will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on this enemy, that is armed with ſinne, and if they
dye, they dye in ſinne: And which is the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of him that dyes in ſinne, his death opens the gate
to another death which is eternall. They ſay they have
repented, but there is no repentance of a ſinne to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
Canſt thou repent of a ſinne before it bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted?
that is but a mockery of God. And what ſaith
the Scripture? Is it not the moſt terrible judgement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heaven to dye in our ſinnes? A man that dyes in ſinne,
dyes in hell, he goeth from death to hell, and that eternall.</p>
            <p>I wonder therefore that the wiſedome of fleſh and
bloud ſhould take away mens wit, and faith, and grace,
and all, ſo much as to ſlight death, and repentance, as if
it were ſo eaſie. Now beloved, death is a terrible thing,
it hath a ſting, and thou ſhalt know it, if thou haſt not
grace to feele the ſting of it whilſt thou liveſt, when
thou dyeſt the ſting will revive, then thy Conſcience
ſhall awake in hell: Drunkenneſſe and jollity takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
ſenſe of ſinne; but ſinne will revive, and conſcience
will revive, God hath not put it into us for nought: death
is terrible, if not diſarmed before hand. And if thou goe
about to dye without diſarming it before, it will not be
out-faced. It is not an enemy to be ſcorned and ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and therefore be Chriſtians in good earneſt, elſe
leave profeſſion, and periſh eternally; for wee muſt all
dye; and it is a greater matter than we take it: but if we
be true Chriſtians, it is the ſweeteſt thing in the world,
an end of all miſery, a beginning of true happineſſe, an
inlet to whatſoever is comfortable; bleſſed are they that
are in the Lord by faith, and them that dye in the Lord,
their death is better than the day of life: Our Birth-day
brings us into miſery; and therefore let me ſpeak to true
Chriſtians, and bid them be aſhamed of fearing death
too much, which of an enemy is become a reconciled
friend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:117791:42"/>
This may in the next place yeeld great conſolation to
thoſe that are in Chriſt Jeſus,<note place="margin">Vſ</note> that death by Chriſt is
ſwallowed up in victory;<note place="margin">Of conſolation to thoſe that are in Chriſt.</note> and the rather, becauſe the holy
Ghoſt meaneth more than a bare victory over death:
Death is not onely ſubdued,<note place="margin">Death is not only ſubdued, but made a friend.</note> but is made a friend to us.
As <hi>Pſalme</hi> 110. it is ſaid his enemies ſhall bee his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole.
Now a footſtoole is not onely trampled upon,
but an helpe to riſe: And ſo death is not onely ſubdued,
but it advanceth Gods Children, and raiſeth them high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
It is not onely an enemy, but a reconciled friend;
for he doth that which no friend in the world can doe;
It ends all our miſery, and is the inlet into all happineſſe
for eternity: And whatſoever it ſtrips us of here, it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
us advantage of better in another world. It cuts off
our pleaſures, and profits, and Company, and Callings
here; but what is that to our bleſſed change afterward, to
our prayſing of God for ever, to the Company of bleſſed
ſoules, and the profits, and pleaſures at the right hand of
God for evermore? And therefore it is not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
but to ſhew the excellency of his power, hee
hath made it a friend of an enemy, and the beſt friend in
the world. It indeed ſeperates ſoule from body, but it
joyneth the ſoule to Chriſt; ſo that the conjunction wee
have by it, is better than the ſeparation, if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
makes us partake of our deſire. I deſire to be
diſſolved, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but that is not well tranſlated;
I deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of
all: ſo that it is not onely, not an enemy, but a friend;
and therefore the Apoſtle makes it our joyncture, part
of our portion, all things are yours. Why? you are
Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods: what are ours? things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
things to come, life, death: And well may death be
ours, becauſe ſinne is our enemy; that remainder that is
kept in our nature to exerciſe us, and humble us, and fit
us for grace, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, I dare be bold to ſay, it is
profitable for ſome to fall,<note place="margin">Its profitable to ſome to fal</note> to make them more carefull
and watchfull, and to prize mercy more: ſo that not only
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:117791:42"/>
Death, but ſinne and the devill himſelfe is ours; for his
plots are for our good: God over-ſhooteth him in his
owne Bow. Hee will give them over to Satan, ſaith
the Apoſtle, that they may learne not to blaſpheme: yet
though they have a ſpirit of blaſphemy by the humbling
of their bodies, they be taught not to blaſpheme, ſo that
not onely death, but ſinne, and hee that brought
ſinne into the World, the Devill, are become our
friends.</p>
            <p>This being ſo,<note place="margin">Satan hath advantage by our fearing death.</note> it may be for ſpeciall comfort, that
wee not feare the King of Feares. The Devill hath
great advantage by this affection of feare, when it is
ſet upon this object <hi>Death:</hi> Overcome death, and all
troubles are overcome; who will fear any thing that hath
given up himſelf to God? Skin for skin, and all that a
man hath, will he give for his life. The Devill know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that well enough; Therefore feare not, ſaith Chriſt,
them that can kill the body: feare cauſeth ſnares, ſaith
<hi>Solomon,</hi> ſnares of Conſcience: But if a man hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the the fear of death once, what more is to be
done? What if they take away life, they cannot take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
that that is better than life, the favor of God. If
we dye in the Lord, we dye in the favor of God, which
is better than life; and we ſhall be found in the Lord at
the day of judgement, and ſhall bee for ever with the
Lord in heaven; and therfore this is a ground of reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in good cauſes, notwithſtanding all threats whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
becauſe death it ſelfe is ſwallowed up in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
            <p>The worſt the world can doe,<note place="margin">The worſt the world can doe is to take away life, and in that they doe the godly a pleaſure.</note> is to take away this
Nature of ours, when they have done that they have done
all they can; and when they have done that, they have
done a pleaſure. That is not to be feared, ſaith <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
that frees us from all that is to be feared. What is to
be feared in the world? every ſickneſſe, every diſgrace;
why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> death frees us from all. We doe ſee every day takes
away a peece of ones life, and when death commeth it
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:117791:43"/>
overthroweth it ſelfe; for the ſoule goeth preſently to
the place of happineſſe, the body ſleepeth awhile, and
death hath no more power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that beleeveth in mee,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>hee ſhall not ſee
death, but is paſt from death to life.</hi> He ſhall not ſee ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
death; but as he lives in Chriſt, ſhall dye in Chriſt,
and riſe againe in Chriſt: He that hath the life of grace
begun, ſhall have it conſummate without interruption.
Its a point of wonderfull Comfort, that death is ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
that we bee in heaven already: And it is no hard
ſpeech, but ſtands with the truth of other points; for
are not Chriſt, and we all one, his body is there, and is
not he the head of his myſticall body? hee that carried
his naturall body, will not hee carry his myſticall body
thither too? will hee bee in piece-meale in heaven?
Therefore we are in heaven already the beſt part of us:
We are repreſented in heaven, for Chriſt repreſents us
there as the Husband doth the Wife. He hath taken up
Heaven for us.</p>
            <p>Chriſt cannot be divided,<note place="margin">Chriſt will draw his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body to him into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> as <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith; we ſit in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
places already with Chriſt. And what a comfort
is this, that while wee live we are in heaven, and that
death cannot hinder us from our Reſurrection, which is
the reſtoring of all things. And therefore, as the Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>Comfort one another with theſe things.</hi> Theſe
things indeed have much comfort in them.</p>
            <p>Let us labour then to bee comfortable, (this uſe the
Apoſtle makes of it,)<note place="margin">Our comfort by Chriſt ſhould make us fruitfull to Chriſt.</note> and fruitfull in our places, upon
conſideration of the victory we have by Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
It is an excellent Chapter that largely proveth Chriſts
victory, as the cauſe of our victory, becauſe hee is the
firſt fruit that ſanctifieth all the reſt. <hi>Finally my brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
bee conſtant, immoveable, alwayes abound in the
works of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in
vaine in the Lord.</hi> He raiſeth that exhortation of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
and conſtancy, from this very ground of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
Chriſt hath gotten by death: <hi>O Death where is thy
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:117791:43"/>
Sting? O Grave where is thy Victory? thanks bee to
God through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And therefore be conſtant,
immovable, alwayes abounding in the worke of the
Lord, knowing that your labour ſhall not be in vaine in
the Lord: Make that uſe the Apoſtle doth of fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to God for Chriſt, that we can thinke of death,
and ſinne, the devill, and all his malice, and not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
yea thinke of them all with comfort, that we be
not onely freed from their tyranny, but they bee our
friends.</p>
            <p>Chriſt hath the Key of Hell and Death; a ſaying ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the cuſtome of Governours that carryed the
Key: he hath the Government and Command of Hell
and Death. Now if Chriſt hath command of Death, he
will not ſuffer Death to hurt his Members, or triumph
alwayes over them, he will keep them in the grave. Our
bodies are ſafe in the grave, the duſt is fitted for a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
for another manner of body than we have now,
and Chriſt that hath the Key will let them out againe:
Therefore truſt awhile till times of reſtoring come, and
then we ſhall have a glorious ſoule, and glorious body,
as the Apoſtle ſaith. I beſeech you think of theſe things,
and get comfort againſt the evill day: And to that end,
be ſure to get into Chriſt, that wee may bee in Chriſt,
living, and dying, and bee found in Chriſt: For
what ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Bleſſed are they that dye in
the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Its better to dye in the Lord, than for the Lord.</note> It is an argument of bleſſedneſſe to dye for
the Lord, but if it be not in the Lord, it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
If there is granted this happineſſe of dying for
the Lord, it is well: <hi>but bleſſed are they that dye in the
Lord.</hi> Why? <hi>they reſt from their labour.</hi> Death
takes them off from their labours; All their good
Workes goe to heaven with them: So ſaith the Spirit,
whatſoever the Fleſh ſaith; and there is no reſting
till that time, their life is full of troubles and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and therefore labour to get aſſurance that wee
are in Chriſt, that wee bee in Chriſt, and dye in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:117791:44"/>
Chriſt, and then, <hi>there is no condemnation to them that
are in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How beſotted are wee to put away preparation of
Death till it comes;<note place="margin">Prepare for death, by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into Chriſt.</note> he that forgets Chriſt, and getting
into Chriſt all his life time, it is Gods juſt judgment that
he ſhould forget himſelf in death. We ſee how a villaine
that hath no care of his owne life, may have power of
another mans life.</p>
            <p>And therefore labour to bee ingraffed into Chriſt by
faith, and that we may know it by the Spirit of Chriſt
prevailing in us over our naturall Corruptions more and
more. As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There is no condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to them that are in Chriſt;</hi> for the ſpirit of life,
<hi>the Law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt, hath
freed me from the Law of ſinne and death,</hi> the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
law of ſinne. If the Law of the ſpirit of life
which is in Chriſt the head be in us in any meaſure, it
frees us from the condemning law of ſinne, that it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
us not whither it would; then wee may ſay with
comfort, <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in
Chriſt;</hi> for the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt, hath
freed us from the condemning, tyrannizing law of ſinne
and death.</p>
            <p>Sinne hath no Law;<note place="margin">Sin hath no Law in us to rule by.</note> It is in us as a ſubdued Rebell,
but it ſets not up a Throne. Some hope to bee ſaved
by Chriſt, and yet they ſet up ſinne a Throne in the
ſoule: Sinne biddeth them defile themſelves, and they
muſt obey it; This is a wofull eſtate, how can they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to dye in the Lord? but ſuch as are freed by the
Law of the Spirit of life. New Lords new Lawes:
When Kings Conquer, they bring fundamentall Lawes;
and when wee are taken from Satans Kingdome into
the Kingdome of Chriſt, the fundamentall Lawes are
then altered. Chriſt by his Spirit ſets up a Law of
believing, and praying, and doing good, and abſtaining
from evill: the Law of the Spirit of life frees us from
the Law of ſinne and death.</p>

things, nothing ſhall go under falſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
all tears ſhall be wiped away; we
have now many cauſes of teares. In the world there is
continuall raiſing of clouds that diſtill into drops of
teares; had we nothing without us to raiſe a vapour to
be diſtil'd in teares, we are able to raiſe up miſts from
our owne miſts, from our owne doubts and conflicts
within.</p>
            <p>As we ſhould weepe for our owne ſinnes, ſo for the
ſinnes of others; as wee may ſee in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> where the
Prophet ſaith, <hi>Oh that my head were a fountaine of

               <note n="*" place="margin">Good men ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to weepe.</note> And indeed good men are eaſie to weepe, as

Our bleſſed Saviour himſelfe, we never read that he
laughed, wee have heard that he wept, and for his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
enemies, <hi>Oh Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem;</hi> He ſhed teares
for them that ſhed his bloud. Teares were maine evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of Chriſts ſweetneſſe of diſpoſition; as that hee
would become man, and a curſe, and die for us, and
that he would make ſo much of little children, and call
all to him that were weary and heavy laden; that hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
refuſed any that came to him. Hee that wept ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for the miſeries and afflictions; this ſhewed his
gracious and ſweet diſpoſition: And that in heaven, he
is ſo full of ſympathies in glory, that when <hi>Paul</hi> perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
the Church, <hi>Why doſt thou perſecute me?</hi> So
though he is free from paſſion in heaven,<note place="margin">Chriſt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> he is not free
from compaſſion, from ſympathie with his Church.
And ſo every child of God is ready, not onely to grieve
for his own ſinnes, and the miſerie that followeth them,
but the ſins and miſeries of others.<note n="*" place="margin">Pſa. 119. 136</note> 
               <hi>Mine eyes guſh out
with rivers of teares,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> when
hee ſaw that men brake the law of God, whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>A true naturall child takes to heart the diſgrace of his
father; if we be not grieved to ſee our father diſgraced,
wee are baſtards, not ſonnes. They that make a ſport of
ſinne, what are they? Alas, they have not one ſparke
of the ſpirit of adoption: they are not children, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
at that at which they ſhould grieve.</p>
            <p>So Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 3. 18,</note> 
               <hi>I have told you often, and now tell

When he ſaw ſome men preach againſt, and others ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe end is damnation, hee
telleth them of it weeping.</p>
            <p>Wee have cauſe therefore to mourne for the ſinnes of
others,<note place="margin">We have cauſe to weepe for the ſinnes of others.</note> and for the miſeries of others; whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

            <p>Firſt, the love of God moveth us to weepe when wee
ſee him diſhonored:<note place="margin">1. From our love to God.</note> If we love the Church, we ſhould
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:117791:46"/>

Doth it not pitty any man to ſee an Oxe go to ſlaughter;
to ſee a man of parts otherwiſe, by ſinning againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
going to ſlaughter; to ſee an ordinary ſwearer,
an uncleane perſon, a prophane wretch, covering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with pride as a garment, ſcorning God, and the
world, and all. Can a Chriſtian looke upon this, ſee
fleſh and blood, like himſelf, under the Goſpell, under a
curſed condition unavoidable, without ſerious repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
and not be affected with it? Can a man ſee a
poore Aſſe fall under a burthen, and not helpe to take it
up, and yet ſee man falling to hell, and not be affected
with it? Thus we ſee wee have cauſe enough of teares:
And as there is cauſe, ſo we ſhould be ſenſible; we ought
to take to heart the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> hee is a dead
man that hath not ſenſe in this kinde. If wee go to the
body and ſtate, or any thing about a man, there is cauſe
of griefe; hath not every member many diſeaſes? and is
not our lives a kind of hoſpitall, ſome ſicke of one thing,
ſome of another? But as there is cauſe wee ſhould bee
ſenſible of it, wee are fleſh and not ſtones, therefore it
is a ſottiſh opinion, to be ſtockiſh and brutiſh; <hi>as if to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
ſorrow and griefe were a glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When our Saviour was ſent into the world,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note>

               <hi>dolor maximus,</hi> there were no patience without
ſenſibleneſſe; away then with that iron, that flinty Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
that thinks it a vertue to be ſtupid: And as the
Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Romans</hi> 1. 31. without naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
He counteth it the greateſt judgement of God upon
the ſoule, yet they would have it a vertue. Why
ſhould I ſmite them any more ſaith God<note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 1. 5.</note>? they have no
ſenſe, no feeling.</p>
            <p>The proud Phyloſopher thought it was not phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall
to weepe; a proud ſtoicall humor, but Chriſtians
deſire it.</p>
            <p>And therefore we ought to labour to be more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that we might make our peace, and reverence the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:117791:46"/>
juſtice of God, and be more ſenſible of him afterwards.
It is moſt true,<note place="margin">The beſt men apteſt to grieve.</note> that <hi>Sapiens miſer, plus miſer;</hi> the more
wiſe any man is, the more ſenſible of miſery: And
therefore of all men, the beſt men have moſt griefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have moſt quicke ſenſes, they be not ſtupifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with inſenſibility, and reſoluteneſſe, to beare it brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the world; but they apprehend with griefe, the
cauſe of griefe. And as they have a more ſanctified
judgement than other men, ſo they have a more wiſe
affection of love, and a quicker life of grace; where
life is, there is ſenſe: and where there is a cleare ſight,
or cauſe of griefe, there is moſt griefe. Therefore the
beſt men have moſt griefe, becauſe they be moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
moſt loving.</p>
            <p>Then they have moſt grace to beare it out of all others;
therefore conſidering there is cauſe in our ſelves, and
in others of griefe continually, wee ought to labour to be
ſenſible of it, elſe it were no favour to have teares wiped
away.</p>
            <p>So that there is cauſe of teares, and teares is a duty of
Chriſtians, ſenſible of the cauſe both of ſinne and miſery,
upon one, and another.</p>
            <p>And as it is an unavoidable griefe,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſo it is good wee
ſhould grieve:<note place="margin">Its good wee doe grieve.</note> we muſt ſtoope to Gods courſe, we muſt
bring our hearts to it, and pray, (that ſince our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and ſins doe call for this diſpenſation, that we muſt
under correction, he will make us ſenſible of his rod)
that he would make good his Covenant of grace, to take
away our ſtony hearts, and give us hearts of fleſh, that we
may be ſenſible.</p>
            <p>Moſt of graces are founded upon affection; and all
graces are but affections ſanctified: what would become
of grace, if wee had not affections? therefore as there
is cauſe of griefe, and teares from griefe, wee ought
to grieve. It is a condition, and a duty; a condition
following miſery, and a duty following our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:117791:47"/>
Take heed of that which hinders ſenſibleneſſe of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and judgement,<note place="margin">Avoid what hnders ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe.</note> that is, hardneſſe of heart, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
ſtudying to put away ſorrow with ſinne: For
we ought to be ſenſible, and ought to labour to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
to know the meaning of every croſſe in our ſelves,
and others.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe wee have croſſes, and we muſt be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of them, <hi>then it followeth, God will wipe away all
teares from our eyes.</hi> Is there nothing for the preſent,
no ground of comfort? yes. As we ought to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of griefe, ſo we ought to be ſenſible of matter of joy
for the preſent, ſpecially if we conſider the time to come.
The life of a Chriſtian is a ſtrange kind of life;<note place="margin">The life of a Chriſtian is a mixture of joy and ſorrow.</note> hee ought
to grieve, and he ought to joy; hee hath occaſion of
both, and hee ought to entertaine both: for that that
wee ought to aime at ſpecially is joy; and if we grieve,
it is that afterwards wee might joy. We muſt be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of any affliction,<note place="margin">Uſes of joy in Chriſtians.</note> that wee might joy afterwards, and
wee ought to labour for it: For is not the joy of the
Lord our ſtrength? Are not we fit to doe ſervice, when
our ſpirits are moſt inlarged? And is it not a credit to
Religion, when we walke in comfort of the holy Ghoſt?
Is it not a ſcandall, when we droope under the croſſe?
Wee ought to be ſenſible, yet not ſo, as to forget mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of joy and comfort. And therefore as wee ought
to grieve, ſo wee ought when we have grieved, to keep
up the ſoule with conſideration of joy for the preſent as
much as wee can,<note place="margin">We ſhould picke matter of comfort out of griefe.</note> yea, to picke out matter of comfort
from the very croſſe. That is the heart of a Chriſtian, not
onely to joy in other matters, but to picke comfort out
of griefe. God ſuffers me to fall into this or that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is a fruit of his fatherly love; he might ſuffer
me to runne the broad way, to be given up to a reprobate
ſenſe and hard heart, but he doth not doe ſo. Picke out
matter of comfort from griefe.</p>
            <p>Then conſider the preſence of God in it; indeed I
have matter of griefe, but I finde God moderating it:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:117791:47"/>
It might be farre worſe, it is his mercy I am not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
I finde God by it doing me good, I finde my ſelfe
better by it, I cannot well be without it. Who would
not labour to be ſenſible of a croſſe, when he looketh up
to Gods croſſe, and juſtice, and mercy, he hath rather
cauſe to joy, than to grieve in the very croſſe it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But ſpecially marke what the holy Ghoſt ſaith here,
wee ought not to be caſt downe overmuch with any
croſſe, conſidering God will wipe away all teares from
our eyes, that is, all naturall teares, and the miſeries of
this life. There ſhall be no more miſery, no more ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
no more trouble.</p>
            <p>And then all teares that ariſe from conſideration of
ſinne, and miſery following ſinne. Death is the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of all mortification. It is a comfort wee ſhall
not alwaies leade this conflicting life, but the warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the fleſh and ſpirit will be taken up; the ſenſe wil
be removed,<note place="margin">All cauſes of ſorrow ſhall be removed.</note> wee ſhall be out of Satans reach, and the
worlds reach one day, which is a great comfort to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider:
Whatſoever the cauſe is, the cauſe ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
ere long. If the cauſe be deſertion, for that God
leaveth us comfortleſſe, wee ſhall be for ever hereafter
with the Lord: If the cauſe be ſeparation from friends,
why wee ſhall all meet together ere long, and be for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in heaven: If the cauſe be our owne ſinnes, wee
ſhall ceaſe hereafter to offend God, and Chriſt will be
all in all; Now ſin is almoſt all in all, ſinne and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
beare a great ſway in us: If the matter of our griefe
be the ſinnes of others, and the afflictions of others; there
is no ſinne in heaven, no uncleane thing ſhall enter
there. The ſoules of perfect men are there, and all are
of one mind, there is no oppoſition to goodneſſe, there
all ſhall goe one way, there (howſoever they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
here) all ſhall have mutuall ſolace and contentment
in one another; they in us and wee in them, and that
for ever; you cannot name them, or imagine a cauſe of
teares, but it ſhall be removed there: Nay, the more
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:117791:48"/>
teares we have ſhed here,<note place="margin">The more teares here, the more joy hereafter.</note> the more comfort wee ſhall
have. As our troubles are increaſed here, our conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhall increaſe: That wee ſuffer here, if for a good

glory: wee ſay <hi>Aprill</hi> ſhowers, bring forth <hi>May</hi> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
It is a common ſpeech from experience of common
life. It is true in Religion, the more teares wee ſhed in
the <hi>Aprill</hi> of our lives, the more ſweet comfort we ſhall
have hereafter: If no teares are to be ſhed here, no
flowers are to be gather'd there. And therefore beſides
deliverance from trouble, here is comfort, God will take

            <q>
               <p>And therefore thus think of it.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The next thing to be conſidered is the order.<note place="margin">The Order, Firſt ſhed teares, and then have them wiped away.</note> Firſt,
we muſt ſhed teares, and then they muſt be wiped away:
After a ſtorme, a calme; after ſowing in teares, comes

            <p>Againe, conſider it is for our increaſe of comfort af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,<note place="margin">Reaſon. 2.</note>
that God will have us ſhed teares; and then
to have our teares wiped away,<note place="margin">For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our comfort.</note> becauſe we be more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of joy, and comfort after ſorrow. We cannot bee
ſenſible of the joyes of heaven, unleſſe wee feele the
contrary here: And therefore of all men, heaven will be
the moſt heaven to them that have had their portion of
Croſſes, and afflictions here. Firſt therefore ſhed teares,
and then they muſt be wiped away, becauſe joy is moſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:117791:48"/>
ſenſible.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As it is with the wickedeſt of all men, they
be moſt miſerable that have been happieſt, becauſe their
ſoule is inlarged by their happineſſe, to apprehend ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
more quickly and ſenſibly; ſo they that have
been moſt miſerable here, ſhall have moſt joy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Now for Uſe:<note place="margin">Uſe. 1.</note> Here is not onely the mercies of God
in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Take notice of the tender mercy of God in this, that he will wipe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way teares.</note> but the tender mercy; that whereas our life is
full of teares, which we have brought upon our ſelves,
yet God ſtoops ſo low as to wipe our eyes, like a father
or mother, his mercy is a ſweet and tender mercy: And
as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, When wee are ſick he maketh our
beds in our ſickneſſe. Chriſt will come, and ſerve them
that watch and ſerve him; nay hee will attend them,
and ſup with them. He is not only mercy and goodneſſe,
but there be in him bowells of mercy; he not onely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
matter of joy and comfort, but hee will doe like a
tender hearted mother, wiping away all teares from our
eyes; we cannot apprehend the Bowells in Gods love,
the pitty and mercy of God towards them that be his,
and afflicted in the World, ſpecially in a good cauſe:
though they bee never ſo many, if they bee penitent
teares, he will wipe them all away.</p>
            <p>And whereas wee muſt ſhed teares here,<note place="margin">Judge not by ſight, for the godly here mourn moſt.</note> that we may
be comforted hereafter, take heed that we doe not in this
life judge by ſight, but by faith: if we live by ſight, wee
are of all men moſt wretched. In the world the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God are moſt miſerable, and of the Children of
God, the beſt Saints. Who hath more cauſe of teares
than the beſt Saints? It is but ſeed time here; while ſeed
time continues, there be teares. The Husbandman while
it is ſeed time cannot doe his office but with trouble: the
Miniſter cannot doe his office, but he is forc'd to take to
heart the ſinnes of the times, to ſee his worke go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
Governours of Families and ſuch, they carry their
ſeed weeping; yea, the beſt men cannot doe good ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
but they doe it with trouble in themſelves, and with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:117791:49"/>
conflict of corruptions. There is no good ſowne here,
but it is ſowne in teares: yet take no ſcandall at this, God
will wipe away all teares.</p>
            <p>The head of the Church our bleſſed Saviour, and all
his gracious Apoſtles, what a life did they live? The
glorious Martyrs that ſealed the truth with their bloud.
And therefore as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 19.</note> 
               <hi>If our happineſſe
were here onely, we were of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> If we

the righteous: we live by ſight; when wee ſee any caſt

of conſcience, wee thinke him forlorne; Oh take heed
of that: For thoſe that ſhed teares here, God will wipe
them all away. <hi>Woe to them that laugh now, for they
ſhall mourne hereafter:</hi> Though wee weepe here, yet
matter of joy enough ſhall ſpring up hereafter. Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will yeeld a quiet fruit of righteouſneſſe to them that
are exerciſed thereby, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. we may not ſee their
fruits preſently, but afterwards: And therefore be not
diſcouraged for any thing we can ſuffer here, or for the
Church, if we ſee her under preſſure. As darkneſſe is
ſowne for the wicked,<note place="margin">Be not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged for our own or Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches cauſes of griefe.</note> the foundation of their eternall
torment is laid in their joy: ſo the ground and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all a godly mans joy is laid in teares.<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 5. 4. Chriſtians have more cauſe of joy than griefe, and they ought to eye both.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed are
they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted.</hi> Yet for the
preſent there is more matter of joy than griefe, if we look
with both eyes: as wee ought to have double eyes, one
to be ſenſible of our griefe as we muſt be, the other of
our comfort, that we may not be ſurprized with griefe.
There is a ſorrow to death, an overmuch ſorrow; it is
unthankfulneſſe to God to forget our comforts, as it is
ſtupidity to forget our ſorrow: Take us at the worſt,
have not we more cauſe of joy then ſorrow? Marke
<hi>Rom. 5. Being juſtified by faith, wee have peace with God,
and rejoyce under hope of glory;</hi> Nay afterwards, ſaith he,
<hi>we rejoyce in tribulations:</hi> And why? upon what ground?
<hi>Knowing that tribulations bring experience, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:117791:49"/>
hope, and hope maketh not aſhamed.</hi> Now we rejoyce
in God reconciled in Chriſt: So that as we ought to
looke with one eye upon the griefe, that we may have
ground to exerciſe grace, which we are not capable of
without ſenſibleneſſe; ſo we muſt look to grounds of joy.
Our life is woven of matter of ſorrow, and joy; &amp; as it is
woven of both, affections ſhould be ſenſible of both, that
they may be more apprehenſive of the grounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
            <p>When the day of perſecution approacheth,<note place="margin">This is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable while we live and when we die.</note> this will
make us comfortable, for our life is a valley of teares;
and ſhall not wee go through this valley of teares, to
this mount where all teares ſhall be wiped away from all
eyes? When we be dejected with the loſſe of any
friend, they ſay as Chriſt ſaid to the woman, weepe
not for me: they be happy, and all teares are wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from their eyes. And therefore as it is matter of
comfort while we live, ſo ground of comfort when wee
die; for there is occaſion of ſorrow in death, parting
with friends and comforts of this world, then teares are
ſhed in more abundance, and then wee bethinke our
ſelves of former ſinnes, and there is renewing of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
more then at other times; yet then are we neer
the time of joy, and neereſt the accompliſhment of the
promiſe, that all teares ſhall be wiped away.</p>
            <p>And ſo you have the whole ſtate of a chriſtian life, an
afflicted condition, I but it is a comfortable condition:
The more afflictions here, the more comfort here, but
ſpecially hereafter. The life of a carnall man is all in
miſery;<note place="margin">A carnall man is all joy, or all ſorrow.</note> if he falls to joy, he is all joy, if to ſorrow, he

of the ſea, like <hi>Achitophell</hi> downe he goeth; when
he is upon the merry pinne, he is nothing but joy: But
a Chriſtians ſtate and diſpoſition are both mixt, he hath
ground of ſorrow for his owne ſinnes, and for the ſinnes
and miſeries of the times; So he hath matter of comfort
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:117791:50"/>
for the preſent, in the favour of God, in the pardoning
of ſinnes, in the preſence of God, in delivering him from
trouble. He hath ſpeciall ground of joy in hope of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

labour for a mixt diſpoſition, and labour to be in a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
frame, ſo to grieve, as out of it to raiſe matter of
joy: And when wee would joy, grieve before, for joy
is ſowne in griefe. The beſt method of joy is for to take
away all that diſturbeth our joy; ſearch the bottome of
the heart, ſee what ſinne is unconfeſt, unrepented of,
ſpread it before God, deſire God to pardon it, to ſeale
the pardon. When our ſoules are ſearched ro the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
then out of that ſorrow ſpringeth joy: and out
of theſe ſighs, and grones that cannot be expreſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
joy unſpeakable, and full of glory. If a man will
be joyfull, let him labour to weepe firſt, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

that will be joyfull, and not ſearch to the bottome, muſt
needs with ſhame be brought backe to ſorrow. When
wee will joy to purpoſe, let us judge our ſelves, that we
may not be judged of the Lord; mourne for our ſinnes,
and then lay hold upon the promiſe, that <hi>all they that
mourne for ſinne ſhall be comforted.</hi> And bleſſed are they
that ſhed teares here, for all teares ſhall be wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>Wee are ſubject to wrong our ſelves both good and
bad; for the good thinke if they be in miſery they ſhall
be ever ſo: the bad if they be in proſperity they ſhall all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
be ſo, and they bleſſe themſelves in it. Now the
the joy of the hypocrites is as the crackling of thornes,
and the griefe of the godly is but ſhort; and therefore
let not the wicked foole themſelves with groundleſſe
hopes, nor the godly vex themſelves with needleſſe
feares; but put off conceitedneſſe of the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of troubles: time is but ſhort, and ere long God
will wipe away all teares from our eyes. No miſts, no
clouds, ſhall be extended to heaven; the ſtate in heaven

provided for Gods people, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it being God himſelfe, who
only can indeed comfort (that which
is ſpecially to be comforted) the
ſoule and the conſcience, he being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the conſcience. The place
where the feaſt is kept is Mount Syon, the Church of
God; the delicacies are deſcribed by fat things, wine
refined on the lees, &amp;c. The beſt of the beſt that can be
thought of, which is Chriſt with all his benefits; who is
bread indeed, and drinke indeed, that cheriſheth and
nouriſheth the ſoule to life everlaſting. And becauſe
there ſhould be nothing to diſturbe the ſolemnity of the
feaſt, he promiſeth to deſtroy the face of covering, to
take away the vaile ſpread over all nations, the vaile of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:117791:51"/>
ignorance and infidelity, to ſhine upon the ſoule, and fill
it full of knowledge, and heavenly comfort. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there can be no comfort where death is feared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the greateſt enemy in this life; therefore he will
ſwallow up death in victory, and all that makes way for
death, or attends death: and when this is taken away,
all the attendants vaniſh with it, <hi>God will wipe away all
teares from all faces.</hi> Becauſe the beſt things have not
the beſt entertainment in the world, nor the beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
God promiſeth that the rebukes of his people
ſhall be taken away from off the earth; what they are
they ſhall be knowne to be. Theſe be very great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

there was no cauſe of teares, nothing was out of

in heaven there ſhall be no teares, becauſe no cauſe of

life is a valley of teares, a life of miſery, and therefore
we ſhed teares here: And wee want no cauſe of it as
long as ſinne is in the world, and ſorrow, and miſery
that followeth ſinne. Our own ſins, and the ſins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
our owne miſeries, and the miſeries of others.
And ſurely a child of God finds this the greateſt cauſe of

alwaies moleſting him in the ſervice of God, he cannot
ſerve God with that chearfulneſſe, his unfeelingneſſe that
he cannot be ſo ſenſible of God diſhonoured by himſelfe
and others is his burthen; hee is grieved that he cannot
grieve enough; he can find teares for other things, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this enough, as the heathen man could ſay. A man
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:117791:52"/>
loſeth his eſtate, and hath teares for them, but forceth
teares for other things, which are the true ground of
griefe; a child of God hath a remainder of corruptions
which puts him on to offend againſt God, and hinders
him in his ſervice, in the liberty and chearfullneſſe of it:
And this he complaines of with <hi>Paul</hi> and others, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
man that I am,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> not for his affliection though that
was much; but, <hi>who ſhall deliver me from this body of
death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will here adde a caſe.<note place="margin">1. A caſe about teares.</note> Some ſay they cannot weep,
but they can grieve, whether then is it neceſſary or no
to weepe? Teares are taken for the ſpring of teares,
griefe, all griefe ſhall be taken away. Teares are but
the meſſengers of griefe; and often times the deepeſt
apprehenſion that takes things deepely, cannot expreſſe
it in teares. In ſome the paſſages fetching the conceit
to the heart are made more tender that they can weepe.
Now the griefe of a Chriſtian is a judiciall griefe, a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
griefe, not onely ſenſible teares muſt have ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
griefe, but a Chriſtians griefe is a ſenſible judiciall
griefe; hee hath a right judgement of things that cauſe
ſorrow, willeth it, and teares are onely an expreſſion of
it.</p>
            <p>But how ſhall I know whether griefe be right or no?
There be teares God hath no bottle for:<note place="margin">Pſa. 56. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Thou putteſt
my teares into thy bottle,</hi> he makes much of them, they
be <hi>Vinum Angelicum</hi> as he ſaith,<note place="margin">God hath no bottle for ſome teares.</note> God is an Angell to
his people to wipe away their teares: but ſome teares
God hath no bottle for, hypocriticall teares, <hi>Dalilahs</hi>
teares, teares of revenge and anger, <hi>Eſaus</hi> teares. And
therefore the true teares that God will wipe away, are
ſuch as firſt of all follow our condition here, our miſery,
God will wipe them away.<note place="margin">Marks of good teares. 1. When their ſpring is the love of God.</note> If wee ſpeake of teares
from a judiciall ground; the ſpring of true teares is the
love of God, and of Chriſt, and of his Church, and the
love of the ſtate of Chriſtianity. Teares ſpring from love,
theſe teares ſpecially.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:117791:52"/>
O a Chriſtian takes to heart that God ſhould be ſo ill
uſed in the world, that Chriſt the Saviour of the world
ſhould finde ſuch entertainement, that he ſhould have
any thing in him that ſhould offend ſuch a Saviour:
this unkindneſſe ſtingeth him to the heart, he takes it
grievouſly that God ſhould be abuſed. <hi>Laetitia habet
ſuas lachrimas,</hi> there is not onely griefe that is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
cauſe of teares, but another cauſe before hand,
that is love. Joy likewiſe hath its teares, though they be
not here meant ſpecially.</p>
            <p>Againe teares are good and ſound,<note place="margin">2. When wee weepe for our own ſins, and ſins of others.</note> when wee weepe
for our owne ſinnes, as well as the ſinnes and miſeries
of others? And I will adde more, wee muſt weepe for
the ſinnes of others, as well as for our owne; For it is
a greater ſigne of the truth of grace to take to heart the
ſinnes of others,<note place="margin">Truth of grace appeares more in grieving for others ſins then our own.</note> more then our owne. You will ſay
this is a kind of paradox, for often a man may take to
heart his owne ſinnes, as matter of terror of conſcience;
not his ſinnes, as contrary to God, having antipathy to
him, being oppoſite to the ſtate of the ſoule, not as ſinne
is properly ſinne, but to be grieved and vexed for ſinne, as
it hath vexation and terror of conſcience. When a man
can take to heart the ſinnes of another, and that truly as it
is an offence of his good God, and a crucifying againe
of his ſweet Saviour, theſe be true teares indeed: It
is more ſigne of grace, then to weepe for a mans owne
ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Some are taken up with terrors of conſcience, that let
their children, family, and friends alone, their heart is
eaten up with ſelfe love, and they be neer eaten up with
their owne terrors of conſcience: but here is true griefe
and an hatred of ſinne in a right reſpect, when it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth
it ſelfe upon others, as well as upon our
ſelves.</p>
            <p>Againe teares ariſe from the right ſpring,<note place="margin">3. When our teares are ſhed in ſecret.</note> from true
griefe, when wee can weepe in ſecret. O ſaith <hi>Jeremy,</hi>
if you doe ſo,<note place="margin">Jer. 13. 17.</note> and ſo, <hi>My ſoule ſhall weepe in ſecret for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:117791:53"/>
your pride;</hi> here was a good ſoule indeed: many will
have teares of comfort in publicke, &amp;c. I but when
they can weepe in ſecret for their owne ſinnes, and the
ſinnes of others, it is an evidence of a right ſpring of
griefe.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">4. When they tend to refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of what they are ſhed for.</note> when teares tend to reformation of what
they grieve for; for elſe they be <hi>Steriles lachrimae,</hi> bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
teares: doe they tend to reforme what wee weepe
for? doe they tend to action? Affections are then good
when they carry to action; as griefe, love, joy, they
are all for action: when wee weepe and grieve, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
withall, it is a good ſigne. I will name no more;
you ſee then, that griefe is ſound, when it ſpringeth from
the love of God, and is for the ſinnes of others, as well
as our owne, and our owne, as well as others; when it
ſtirres up to reformation; when it is in ſecret; and
therefore let us examine our griefe by theſe and the like
evidences, it will be a good character of a gracious ſoule.
Then God will carry himſelfe as a ſweet nurſe, or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
mother to her child that ſheddeth teares; God will
wipe away all theſe teares. O the tranſcending love
of God, his love is a tender love; the love of a mother,
the love of a nurſe! it is not love, but the bowels of love,
the bowells of mercy and compaſſion: how low doth
he ſtoope to wipe away the teares of his children! <hi>God
will wipe away all teares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will propound one queſtion more, and then proceed.
But wee are bid to rejoyce alwaies; why then is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
that we weepe and mourne? can two contraries
ſtand together?</p>
            <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">2. Caſe.</note> very well; for wee may grieve, as wee
have matter of griefe, and are in a condition of griefe:
And we may rejoyce,<note place="margin">How can a Chriſtian joy and grieve to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> and ought to rejoyce, as we look
to the promiſe that God will wipe away all teares. When
we thinke of the preſent cauſe wee cannot but grieve,
but when wee looke beyond all troubles, we cannot but
joy, it hath influence of joy into our heart: nay for the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:117791:53"/>
preſent we may joy, and grieve, without looking to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
ſometimes. If we conſider that we have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
God, done that that grieveth his ſpirit, that is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of griefe: but when we conſider wee have Chriſt at
his right hand, that ſpeaketh peace for us, and makes
our peace by vertue of his mediation, that giveth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
So that wee have cauſe of joy, and cauſe of griefe,
about the ſame things at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>Wee are never in ſuch a ſtate of griefe here, but if we
looke about us, looke foreward, looke upward, A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
that is, a good Chriſtian, is a perſon that hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things to looke after, that he may mannage his eſtate
of Chriſtianity wiſely: He is to looke to himſelfe and
his ſinnes, to the mercies of God in Chriſt, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie
of it, that it is anſwerable to the fruit of it in
peace and joy here, and happineſſe hereafter, which
are conſtant too; his grace, as himſelfe is conſtant, the
fruits of it conſtant:<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 4.</note> Therefore <hi>rejoyce evermore.</hi> And
(ſaith the Apoſtle: I know what I ſay, I am well advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
<hi>evermore rejoyce.</hi> So that the life of a Chriſtian is a
mixed life; nay the ground of our joy, is our ſorrow,
and griefe, and joy is ſowne in griefe. If we will rejoyce
indeed, let us mourn indeed; true joy ariſeth and ſprings
out of ſorrow.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the next. <hi>And the rebukes of his people
ſhall be taken away from of the face off the earth.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
benefit that makes the Feaſt ſweet and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is this; Hee will take away the rebukes of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.<note place="margin">Gods people here are under rebuke and reproach.</note>
And here is the ſame method to be uſed: that
Gods children, his Church and people, are under rebukes,
and under reproach.</p>
            <p>We need not ſtand to prove the truth of it. It is true,
Firſt, the head of the Church, and the Church it ſelfe,
and every particular member, they goe under rebukes.
For the head of the Church, we ſhould ſpend the time to
no purpoſe to prove it; what was Chriſts life? it was
under a vaile, he appeared not to be what he was; you
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:117791:54"/>
know he was eſteemed the chiefe of Devills, an enemy
to his Prince, to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> I will not ſpend time in cleare
truths.</p>
            <p>For the Church it ſelfe you ſee in the Booke of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
3. There is a strange people that acknowledge no law,
they be againſt the lawes of the Prince;</hi> they paſſe under
the imputation of rebells: the poore Church that had
thoughts of peace, the meek Church of God, they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as enemies of the ſtate; as Chriſt the head was.
And ſo the Church in <hi>Babylon,</hi> under what rebukes was
it?<note place="margin">Pſal. 137.</note> they reproached them, <hi>By the waters of Babylon we
ſat downe and wept, when they ſaid ſing us one of the

all this life: The world is a kind of <hi>Babylon</hi> to
Gods people, and then ſing us one of your ſongs; where
is now your God, ſay the hearts of wretched peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
when they ſaw the people of God in diſgrace.
<hi>Tully</hi> could ſay of the nation of the Jewes; <hi>It ſheweth
how God regardeth it, it hath bin ſo often overcome.</hi>
Thus the heathen man could ſcorne the ſtate of Gods
people. You ſee how the Pſalmiſt complaines in the
name of particular Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 78.</note> 
               <hi>where is his God, he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
in him, let him ſave him.</hi> Oh this was daggers to
<hi>Davids</hi> heart, <hi>Pſal. 42. 10. It peirced to my heart, when
they ſaid where is thy God.</hi> To touch a Chriſtian in his
God, as if God had no care of him, it is more then his
owne griefe and affliction. So when a child of God is
rebuked and affronted, when religion muſt ſuffer by it.
So that the head of the Church, the members of the
Church, are under rebukes, as it may be proved, if I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
you through all ſtories.</p>
            <p>At this day, the Church of the Jewes you ſee what it
is come to: the nation of the Jewes under what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

There is a light ſhineth in the life of them that be good;

that they may be alike: men cannot abide diſtinctions

and take up perſons and things under prejudice. It is
enough for them, that this is ſaid of them, they have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wit nor judgement, nor ſo much patience, from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
their luſts, as to examine them: And that
makes them ſo mad as they are. <hi>Calumniare audacter
aliquid haerebit,</hi> Slander ſtoutly, ſomething will ſticke
they are ſure of it. That which hath raiſed, and ruined
many a man, is that of <hi>Hamans</hi> caſting of jealouſie upon
thoſe that are better then themſelves. That was <hi>Hamans</hi>
trick, and ſo will be the practice of the wicked, as it hath
bin from the beginning, ſo to the end of the world. <hi>Thou
art not Caeſars friend</hi> ſay they, and its enough to <hi>Pilate;</hi>
thus it hath bin and will be to the end of the world.
Therefore we had need to be wiſe, that wee be not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
Men will never leave to ſpeake ill, till they have
learned to ſpeak better, till the ſpirit of God hath taught
them.</p>
            <p>Now it is ſaid that Chriſt will take away the rebukes
of his people.<note place="margin">Things ſhall be known to be as they ar<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

now. In this confuſion we muſt looke to the cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe,
the concluſion of all; hee will take away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
of all. God is the Father of truth, and truth is the
daughter of time; time will bring forth truth at laſt.
And thoſe that be honourable indeed, ſhall be honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.<note place="margin">Reaſon</note>

God, but ſhall ſhine forth gloriouſly; even all his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency

fers them to goe away with it, that are his enemies; he
is working another thing by ſuffering them, he is work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the glory of his children, and confuſion of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
There is nothing in God but ſhall gloriouſly
ſhine, and nothing in his children, no beames of God,
but ſhall gloriouſly ſhine to the confuſion of the world:
They that are good, ſhall be knowne to be good, God
will bring their righteouſneſſe to light. The Witneſſes
that vexed the world,<note place="margin">Revel. 11.</note> and had baſe entertainement,
they were ſlaine and diſgraced, but they roſe againe and
were carried to heaven, as <hi>Elias.</hi> So there will be a
reſurrection of name, a reſurrection of reputation: That
that is good ſhall be good, and that that is bad ſhall be
bad; it ſhall be knowne to be as it is. This is for comfort.</p>
            <p>You hear therefore what courſe to take under diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace;<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note>
what ſhall wee doe,<note place="margin">To direct what courſe to take under diſgrace and ſcandall.</note> when the Church paſſeth
under diſgrace? as it is now: A Proteſtant is worſe
then a Turke or a Jew, amongſt the railing Papiſts. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our ſelves wee ſee under what reputation the beſt
things goe, it is too well knowne to ſpeake of: And the
ſcandall taken from hence doth extreamely harden, it
keepes men from religion, it draweth many from religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that have entred into it, becauſe they have not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſo much ſelfe denyall, as to venture upon diſgrace.
And ſurely where no ſelfe-denyall is, there is no religion.
Chriſt knew what doctrine he taught, when he taught
ſelf-denyall in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>What ſhall wee doe therefore?<note place="margin">1. Labour to be innocent.</note> Labour firſt of all for
innocency; that if men wil reproach, they may reproach
without a cauſe.</p>
            <p>Then labour for a ſpirit of patience to ſerve Chriſt
with;<note place="margin">2. To be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</note> great is your reward when men ſpeake evill of

this life, to doe well, and ſuffer ill. Of all, certainely they
are beſt that out of love to goodneſſe, are carried to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
without looking to rewards, or diſgrace, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
with a ſingle eye. Labour therefore for patience,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:117791:56"/>
and not onely ſo,<note place="margin">3. To be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious.</note> but for courage; for the Moone goeth
its courſe, and lets the dog barke: Wee have a courſe
to runne, let us keepe our courſe conſtantly; paſſe
through good reports, and bad reports, be at a point,
what the world thinkes, wee ſeeke applauſe at another
theater then the world.</p>
            <p>Againe then,<note place="margin">4 To be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</note> labour for ſincerity under rebukes, that
wee have a good aime, ſuch an aime as <hi>Paul</hi> had: <hi>If I

               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 13. 14</note> he being earneſt for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

of my wits it is for Chriſt. <hi>If I be ſober it is for you, the
love of Chriſt conſtraineth me to be ſo.</hi> Get the love of
Chriſt, and that will make a man care for nothing. If I
goe beyond my ſelf, it is to God: As <hi>David</hi> ſaid, when
he was mocked by <hi>Micholl:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 20. 21.</note> 
               <hi>It is to the Lord,</hi> when he

where <hi>Micholl</hi> ſcoffeth, and <hi>David</hi> danceth; where
gracious men magnifie God, and have <hi>Micholls</hi> to ſcoffe

for it is to the Lord. Labour that our aimes be good, and
it is no matter what the world judgeth of them.</p>
            <p>And when all will not doe,<note place="margin">5. Commend our credits to God by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> commend our credits to
God by prayer, as wee commend our ſoules and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

that hee would bring our righteouſneſſe to light, that it
ſhould ſhine out as the noone day. So <hi>David</hi> doth, hee
complaines to God, and commendeth all to him, prayeth
him to take part againſt his enemies, to right his cauſe;
and when wee have done that,<note place="margin">Comfort your ſelfe in your own true worth.</note> wee have done our duty:
yet with all hope for better things; be content to paſſe
under the world as unknowne men, and to be inwardly
worthy, and paſſe as unknown men. Rich men if truly
rich, they will applaud themſelves in their boſomes,
though the world diſgrace them, yet at home I am thus
furniſh'd. And ſo a Chriſtian that knoweth his worth,
that he is a child of God, heire of heaven, that he is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon by Angels, that hee is a jewell to God in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:117791:57"/>
to be abſolutely the beſt thing in the world. Hee
knoweth the worth of a Chriſtian, and his owne worth
as being a Chriſtian; he applauſeth and comforteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
in that he knoweth he hath a hidden life, a ſtate of
glory hidden in Chriſt. Now it is covered with diſgrace,
and diſreſpect in the world, ſcorned and reproached, but
what is that to him? it is an hidden life, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
he knoweth his owne excellency, and therefore can
paſſe through good report,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 3.</note> and bad report. <hi>I care not for
mans day</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> there is another day to which I muſt
ſtand.</p>
            <p>And thus if we do,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4 14.</note> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is a ſpirit of

under rebuke, and diſgrace, there is a ſpirit of glory,

comfort, inward joy, inward love of God. <hi>A ſpirit
of glory ſhall reſt upon you,</hi> and ſhall continue with you, as

that Gods people ſuffer in the world,
there is none greater than reproach,
diſgrace, and contumely, <hi>Movemur
contumeliis plus quam injuriis: We are
more moved with reproaches than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</hi>
Injuries come from ſeverall cauſes, but diſgrace
from abundance of ſlighting. No man but thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
worthy of reſpect from ſome or other. Now ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
come from abundance of malice, or elſe abundance
of contempt; and therefore nothing ſtickes ſo much
as reproaches, ſpecially by reaſon of opinion, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that raiſeth them over high.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour Chriſt endured the Croſſe and deſpiſed
the ſhame. That ſhame that vaine people caſt upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:117791:58"/>
and the beſt things, they deſpiſe that, and make
that a matter of patience: They knew the Croſſe
would not be ſhaken off, Perſecution and Troubles muſt
be endured, and therefore they endured the Croſſe, and
deſpiſed the ſhame. Now to bear Croſſes take the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of the Holy Apoſtles, look up to him, conſider Chriſt,
and whatſoever diſgrace in words or carriage wee ſhall
endure, we are ſure, (though wee ſhall never know it,
till wee feele it by experience) <hi>The ſpirit of glory ſhall
reſt upon us,</hi> and rebuke ſhall be taken away.</p>
            <p>Ere long there will be no glory in heaven and earth,
but the glory of Chriſt, and of his Spouſe, for all the reſt
ſhall be in their owne place: as it was ſaid of <hi>Judas,</hi>
that <hi>he went to his place.</hi> Their proper place is not to
domineere, but to be in hell, and ere long they ſhall bee
there. Heaven is the proper element of the Saints, that
is the place of Chriſt the head. And where ſhould
the body be, but with the head? where the Spouſe, but
with the Husband? I ſay this ſhall come to paſſe, that
all the wicked ſhall be in their place, and all the godly in
theirs, with Chriſt, and then ſhall the rebukes of Gods
people be taken away. A great matter, and therefore it
is ſealed with a great confirmation, <hi>The Lord Jehovah
hath ſpoken it;</hi> therfore it muſt, and will be ſo: <hi>The mouth
of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> This is not in vaine added,
for the Lord knoweth well enough we need it, to believe
ſo great things that there is ſuch a Feaſt provided; And
that there is ſuch a victory over death our laſt enemy,<note place="margin">God is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</note> and
that there will be ſuch glory, that all the glory ſhall bee
Chriſts, and his Spouſes, that the wicked that are now
ſo inſolent, ſhall be caſt into their proper place with the
Devill, by whoſe Spirit they are led: They bee great
matters; and there is great diſproportion between the
preſent condition, and that condition in heaven, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
being in the ſoule, its hard to faſten ſuch things on
the ſoule, that ſo great things ſhould be done; but they
are no greater than God hath ſaid, and hee is able to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:117791:58"/>
make good his Word, <hi>The Lord hath ſaid it;</hi> and
when God hath ſaid it heaven and earth cannot unſay it;
when heaven hath concluded it, earth and hell cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anull
it; <hi>The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it,</hi> That is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
truth it ſelfe hath ſpoken it, that cannot lye. A man may
lye, and be a man, and an honeſt man too, he may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſpeak an untruth, it taketh not away his nature:
But God who is pure truth, unchangable truth, truth it
ſelfe, cannot lye.</p>
            <p>When we heare of great matters,<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> as matters of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
be great matters,<note place="margin">Conſider God in the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to helpe our faith.</note> they be as large as the capacity
of the ſoule, and larger too; And yet the ſoule is large
in the underſtanding, and affection too; When wee
heare of ſuch large matters, wee need a great faith to
believe them. Great faith needeth great grounds, and
therefore its good to have all the helps we can. When
we heare of great things promiſed, great deliverances,
great glory; to ſtrengthen our faith, remember God hath
ſpoken them; He knoweth our weakneſſe, our infirmity,
and therefore helps us with this prop, The mouth of the
Lord hath ſpoken it. Let us therefore remember, thoſe
great things are promiſed in the word of God, in the
word of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that can make them all good, that
gives a being to all his promiſes: He is being it ſelfe, and
gives being to whatſoever he ſaith; he is able to doe it.
Set God and his power againſt all oppoſition whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

grant one thing in Religion or another. But let him grant
there is a God and a Reaſonable Creature, then there
muſt be a ſervice, a Religion; and this ſervice muſt bee
according to ſome Rules preſcribed; for the ſuperior will
not be ſerved as the inferior pleaſeth: he muſt diſcover
what good the ſuperior intendeth, and what duties he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects:
this muſt be revealed in ſome word; God and
the Reaſonable Creature, and Religion, make a neceſſity
of a word, and that muſt be the word we have, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and what word in the world is probable to bee the
word but this?</p>
            <p>You will ſay it may be corrupt.<note place="margin">Object.</note> The Jewes looked to
the old Teſtament,<note place="margin">The word may bee corrupted.</note> that it ſhould not be corrupted; for

theſe reaſons to thoſe which the ſoule of a gracious

            <p>And therefore let us regard it as the word of God,<note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note>

they are condemned by God; and whom we ſhut
heaven to, by opening the Scriptures, God will ſhut
heaven to. The opening of the Scriptures is the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

in ſuch a ſinne ſhall not be ſaved, heaven ſhall be ſhut to
him, he is in a ſtate of death, he is ſtrucken, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:117791:61"/>
of their ſinnes, they be wounded, they be ſtruck by the

be not executed; and they be as much in danger of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
death as a condemned Traytor, onely God ſuffers
them to live, that they may make their peace, they have

the reliſh of divine truths, that when wee heare them
we may reliſh the truth in them, and may ſo feele the
worke of Gods Spirit, that we may bee able to ſay, hee
is our God. And when we heare of any threatning, we
may tremble at it, and any ſinne diſcovered, wee may
hate it: For unleſſe wee by the Spirit of God have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

the Lord by his Spirit to frame our hearts to be ſuitable
to divine Truths, and ſo frame them in our affections,
that we may find the word in our joy, in our love, in our
patience, that all may be ſeaſoned with the word of God.
When there is a reliſh in the word,<note place="margin">Reliſhing the word makes a man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian indeed.</note> and in the ſoule ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

ſoule, they doe not know the word to bee the word by
arguments fetched from the word, and therefore they
fall from the power of the word. But if we will not fall
from divine truths get truth written in the heart, and our
hearts ſo ſeaſoned by it, and made ſo harmonious and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

            <p>To goe on:</p>

            <p>It is an excellent portion of Scripture to ſhew the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

performed, vvhich is not preſently; for the end of a
promiſe is to ſupport the ſoule till the performance.
God doth not onely reſerve great things for us in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vvorld, but to comfort us in the vvay, doth reach
out to us Promiſes to comfort us till vvee come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
There is a time when he will performe them, and
not onely a time, but there are likewiſe promiſes of
performance: at that time the promiſes of theſe great
things ſhall be performed.</p>
            <p>The next thing is, that God will ſtirre up in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Children a diſpoſition ſuitable: That is, the Grace of
waiting. As great things were promiſed before, ſo
the ſoule hath a grace fit for it: Wee have waited for
thee.</p>
            <p>And as they wait for them, while they are in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
ſo they ſhall enjoy them: Wee have way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for thee, and wee will bee glad in thy ſalvation.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:117791:63"/>
We ſhall ſo enjoy them, that we ſhall joy in them: Good
things when they be enjoyed, they bee joyed in.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Againe, wee ſhall rejoyce in our ſalvation; wee
ſhall glory in our God. After they bee a while exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in waiting, then commeth performance, then
they bee enjoyed, and they bee enjoyed with joy,
in glorying in God. For that is the iſſue of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
when hee hath what hee would enjoy, when
hee enjoyeth it with joy, when the fruit of it is, that
God hath his glory, and therefore the heart can rejoyce
in his ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Then there is a day, as for the exerciſing of his
people here by waiting: So there is a day of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
promiſes. <hi>In that day.</hi> That is, a day of all
dayes: When that day commeth, then all Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Promiſes ſhall be accompliſhed to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
            <p>But before that great day, there is an intermediate
performance of Promiſes aſſiſted by waiting, to drop
comfort to us by degrees: He reſerveth not all to that
day, there be leſſer dayes before that great day. As at
the firſt comming of Chriſt, So at the overthrow of
Antichriſt, the Converſion of the Jewes, there will be
much joy; but that is not that day, theſe dayes make
way for that day. VVhenſoever Prophecies ſhall end
in Performances, then ſhall bee a day of joying and
glorying in the God of our ſalvation for ever. And
therefore in the <hi>Revelations</hi> where this Scripture is ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>Revelations</hi> 21. 4. is meant the Converſion of
the Jewes, and the glorious eſtate they ſhall enjoy before
the end of the world: We have waited for our God, and
now we enjoy him. I, but what ſaith the Church
there? <hi>Come Lord Ieſus come quickly:</hi> there is yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>come Lord,</hi> till wee be in heaven. So that though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate,
promiſes bee performed here, yet there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
great day of the Lord to be performed, which is
ſpecially meant here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:117791:63"/>
The laſt thing conſiderable in the words is the manner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
of expreſſion: They are expreſſed full of life, and with
repetition, to make them ſure and more certaine, <hi>In that
day it ſhall be ſaid, this is our God, wee have waited for
him, he ſhall ſave us:</hi> He bringeth them in ſpeaking theſe
words of affection.</p>
            <p>Indeed when wee come to enjoy the performance
of Gods gracious promiſes, if we ſhould live to ſee the
fulneſſe of the Gentiles come, and Jewes called, wee
ſhould ſpeake of it againe, and againe: Affections are
large, and few expreſſions will not ſerve for large affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It will be no tautology to ſay, <hi>This is our God, wee
have waited for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beloved, times are yet to come which may much
affect the hearts of the Children of God. Howſoever
we may not live to ſee the performance of theſe things,
yet wee ſhall all live to ſee that day of Judgement, and
then we ſhall ſay, <hi>This is our God, wee have waited
for him.</hi> VVee now ſee God in the Promiſes, and
then wee ſhall ſee him face to face whom wee have
waited for in the Promiſes, and we ſhall ſee him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

            <p>
               <hi>Loe, this is our God, we have waited for him.</hi> VVhile
we live here we are in ſtate of waiting, wee are under
Promiſes, and a condition under promiſes is a waiting
condition; a condition of performance is an enjoying
condition. VVe are in a waiting condition till our bodies
be raiſed out of the grave: for when vve dye vvee vvait
for the reſurrection of our bodies. VVe may ſay as <hi>Jacob</hi>
vvhen he vvas dying, <hi>I have waited for thy ſalvation.</hi> VVe
are in a vvaiting condition till body and ſoule bee joyned
together at the day of judgement for ever.</p>
            <p>And therefore vve ſhould labour to have thoſe graces
that are ſuitable for this condition. The things vve vvait
for are of ſo tranſcending excellency, as glory to come,
that they cannot bee vvaited for, but the ſpirit by the
things vvaited for, fitteth us to vvaite for them. A man
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:117791:64"/>
cannot vvait for glory of ſoule and body, but the Spirit
that raiſeth up faith to believe, and hope to vvait, vvill
purge, and fit, and prepare him for that glorious conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>He that hath this hope purifieth himſelfe, as hee is
pure.</hi> Oh it is a quickning waiting, and a purging wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
it is efficacious by the Spirit to fit, and purifie his
ſoule ſuitable to that glorious condition hee waits for.
Where that is not, it is but a conceit; a very ſlender ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of the glory to come will make men better.
He that hath hope of heaven and happineſſe under glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
it will make him ſuitable to the place hee looketh

ſhall be ſaid in that day, loe this is our
God.</hi> The mouth of the Lord hath
ſpoken gracious things before, hath
promiſed a Feaſt, and an excellent
Feaſt. Gods manner is firſt of all to
give promiſes to his Church;<note place="margin">Promiſes of God, flow from Gods goodneſſe.</note> why?
his goodneſſe commeth from his goodneſſe, his goodneſſe
of grace commeth from his goodneſſe of nature: <hi>He is
good, and doth good.</hi> Now the ſame goodneſſe of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
which we call bounty, that reſerveth heaven and
happineſſe for us in another world; the ſame goodneſſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:117791:65"/>
will not ſuffer us to be without all comfort in this world:
Becauſe the knowledge and revelation of the glory to
come hath much comfort in it. Therefore in mercy he
not only intendeth performance of glory, but out of the
ſame fountaine of goodneſſe, he intendeth to reveale
whatſoever is good for his Church in the way to glory.
So that promiſes of good, come from the ſame goodneſſe
of God by which he intendeth heaven: For what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
God to come out of that hidden light, that no man
can come into, and diſcover himſelfe in his ſonne? The
word in his promiſes to reveale his minde to mankinde,
and make knowne what he will have us to doe, and
what he will doe to us? but onely his goodneſſe is the
cauſe of all. And therefore the end of promiſes in Gods
intention is to comfort us in the way to heaven, that we
may have ſomething to ſupport us; they are <hi>promiſſa,
quaſi praemiſſa:</hi> They are promiſes and premiſes, and ſent
before the thing it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now here it commeth that the glory to come is tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the joy of heaven, and the glorious eſtate to come.
You have need of patience, that you may get the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
heaven and happineſſe is called the promiſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we have them aſſured in promiſes. The bleſſings
of the New Teſtament are called promiſes; as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the promiſe, yea the heires of glory; becauſe all
is conveyed by a promiſe, therefore all happineſſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
by a promiſe.</p>
            <p>Now the promiſes are of good things.<note place="margin">Promiſes free and full.</note> They are for
the ſpring of them, <hi>free,</hi> from Gods free goodneſſe; for
the meaſure of them, <hi>full;</hi> for the truth of them, <hi>conſtant,</hi>
even as God himſelfe that promiſeth. And therefore wee
may well build upon them.</p>
            <p>Before I goe any farther, I beſeech you let us account
the promiſes of the good we have to be our beſt treaſure,<note place="margin">Uſe.</note>
our beſt portion,<note place="margin">Let us count promiſes our beſt treaſure.</note> our beſt riches, for they be called pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
promiſes; not onely becauſe they be precious in
themſelves, but becauſe they are from the precious love
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:117791:65"/>
of God in Chriſt to us. They are likewiſe for precious
things, they are laid hold of by precious faith, as the
Scripture calleth them, and therefore they are precious
promiſes. Let us not onely account of our riches that
wee have; for what is that we have, to what wee ſpeak
of, to that wee have in promiſe. A Chriſtian is rich in
reverſion, rich in bills, and obligations: Chriſt hath
bound himſelfe to him, and he can ſue him out when he
pleaſeth. In all kinds of neceſſitie, he can ſue God for
good; hee can goe to God and ſay, <hi>Remember thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
Lord, wherein thou haſt cauſed me thy ſervant to
truſt;</hi> and can binde God with his own word.</p>
            <p>But I take this onely in paſſage as the foundation of
what I am to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>From the mouth of God you ſee the great promiſes
delivered: and now we have waited for them. That
which anſwereth promiſes, is expectation and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing therefore between the promiſes
wherein God is a debter,<note place="margin">God taketh a long day for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</note> and the performance, is, that
there is a long time, a long day: oftentimes God takes
a long day for performing of his promiſe, as 400 yeares
<hi>Abrahams</hi> poſterity went to be in <hi>Egypt.</hi> And it was
4000 yeares from the beginning of the world, till the
comming of Chriſt, which was the promiſe of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
the promiſe of the ſeed, a great long day: And
therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to come in the latter end of the
world. <hi>Abraham</hi> had promiſe of a ſonne, but it was
not performed till he was an old man: <hi>Symeon</hi> had a
promiſe to ſee Chriſt in the fleſh, but hee was an old

God taketh a long day for his promiſes; long to

            </p>
            <p>The promiſes of God are long in performing; for to

take us off from the creature,<note place="margin">To waine from the creature.</note> and to indeare the things

intended to inlarge my ſelfe in that point. A Chriſtian
hath a title to heaven, as ſoon as he is a Chriſtian, he is
an heire to heaven; perhaps he may live here twenty,
or fourty yeares more, before God takes him up to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
why doth he defer it ſo long?</p>
            <p>The reaſon is,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 4.</note> God will fit us for heaven by little and
little;<note place="margin">To fit us for injoyment.</note> and will perfume us as <hi>Eſther</hi> was perfumed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe muſt come to <hi>Ahaſuerus:</hi> there were many
weekes, and moneths of perfuming: So God will ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and fit us for heaven and happineſſe. It is a holy
place, God a holy God: Chriſt is that holy one; and
for us to have everlaſting communion with God and
Chriſt in ſo holy a place, requireth a great preparation.
And God by deferring it ſo long, will mortifie our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
by little and little, and will have us die to all baſe
things here in affection, before we die indeed. <hi>David</hi>
had title to the Kingdom as ſoone as ever he was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
but <hi>David</hi> was fitted to be an excellent King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
by deferring the performance of the promiſe till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward:
So in our right and title, and poſſeſſion of
heaven, there is a long time betweenl</p>
            <p>Our Saviour Chriſt was 34 yeers before he was taken
up to heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Simile.</note> becauſe hee was to worke our ſalvation:
And he was willing to ſuſpend his glory for ſuch a time,
that he might doe it; to ſuſpend his glory due to him,
from the firſt moment of his conception: For by vertue
of the union, glory was due to him at the firſt; but becauſe
he had taken upon him to be a Mediator, out of love hee
would ſuſpend his glory due to him, that he might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.
And ſo God by way of conformity, will ſuſpend
the glory due to us, that we may be conformed to Chriſt.
Though wee have right to heaven, as ſoon as wee are
borne, yet God will ſuſpend the full performance of it;
becauſe he will by correction, and by length of time
ſubdue by little and little that which maketh us uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to our head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:117791:66"/>
And can we complaine for any deferring of heaven
when wee are but conformed to our glorious head, who
was content to be without heaven ſo long.</p>
            <p>But to goe on. As there be gracious and rich promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and they have long time of performance to us, and
<hi>hope deferred makes the ſoule languiſh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A condition of waiting, is a mixt condition of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</note> So God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth
a ſpirit to fit that expectation of his, a ſpirit of
hope and waiting: And this waiting hath ſomething
perfect in it, and ſomething imperfect; it is a mixt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
There is good, becauſe there is a promiſe; for a
promiſe is the declaration of Gods wil concerning good:
But becauſe it is a promiſe of a thing not performed,
there is an imperfection. So there is a mixture in the
promiſe, and a mixture in the grace, hope, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and waiting, is an imperfect grace. That there
be glorious things, it is perfection of good; that we have
them not in poſſeſſion, that is the imperfection. So that
hope is ſomthing, but it is not poſſeſſed; a promiſe is
ſomething, but it is not the performance. A ſeed is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
but it is not the plant.</p>
            <p>Thus God mixeth our condition here of perfection and
imperfection; hee will have us in ſtate of imperfection,
that wee may not thinke our ſelves at home in our
Countrey, when wee are but in our way: Therefore
he will have us in a ſtate of imperfection, that wee may
long homeward; yet hee will have it a ſtate of good,
that we may not ſinke in the way.</p>
            <p>And not onely promiſes;<note place="margin">Wee have a taſte here of what we ſhall have hereafter to ſupport us.</note> for in the way to heaven,
God keeps not all for heaven, he lets in drops of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
oftentimes in the midſt of miſery, hee doth reveale
himſelfe more glorious and ſweet then at other times:
there is nothing reſerved for us in another world, but
wee have a beginning, a taſte, an earneſt of it here, to
ſupport us, till wee come to the full poſſeſſion of what
remaineth. Wee ſhall have full communion of Saints
there; wee have it here, in the taſte of it: Wee know
what it is to be acquainted with them that be gracious
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:117791:67"/>
ſpirits: Wee have praiſing of God for ever there; we
know the ſweetneſſe of it here, in the houſe of God,
which made <hi>David</hi> deſire this one thing, <hi>that hee might
dwell in the houſe of God, to viſit the beauty of God, &amp;c.</hi>
There wee ſhall have perfect peace; here we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace, unſpeakable and glorious; a peace that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
underſtanding in the beginning of it: There we
ſhall have joy without all mixture of contrariety; here
we have joy, and joy unſpeakable and full of glory.
There is nothing in heaven that is perfect, that is ſweet
and good, and comfortable, but we have a taſte, and
earneſt of it here. The ſpirit will be all in all there, there
is ſomthing of it in us now: more light in our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
more obedience in our wills, more and more
love in our affections, and it is growing more and
more.</p>
            <p>And therefore all is not kept for time to come: we
have ſomthing beginning here, beſides promiſes; there
is ſome little degrees of performance; ſo that the ſtate
between us and heaven, is a ſtate mixt of good, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection.</p>
            <p>Now God hath fitted graces ſuitable to that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Waiting is a grace whereby God ſits us for an imperfect condition.</note>
and that is expectation, or waiting, a fit grace, and a fit
diſpoſition of ſoule from imperfect condition, that is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to be perfected; for fruition is the condition of
perfect happineſſe, not of waiting: for waiting implieth
imperfection.</p>
            <p>This waiting carrieth with it almoſt all graces,<note place="margin">Waiting car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth with it all graces.</note> wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for better times in glory to come, it hath to ſupport
it. It is a carriage of ſoule that is ſupported with many
graces. For firſt we wait for that we believe, we have a
ſpirit of faith to leade to it: And then we hope, before we
waite, and hope is the anchor of the ſoule that ſtayeth
the ſoule in all the waves and miſeries of the world; it is
the helmet that keeps off all the blowes: This hope iſſues
from faith for what we believe, we hope for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:117791:67"/>
So that all graces make way for waiting,<note place="margin">1. Patience.</note> or accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it. The graces that accompany the waiting for good
things in time to come, are <hi>patience,</hi> to endure all griefes
between us and the full poſſeſſion of heaven.<note place="margin">2. Long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> Then
<hi>long ſuffering,</hi> which is nothing elſe but patience length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
becauſe troubles are lengthned, and the time is
lengthned: So there is patience, and patience length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
which we call long ſuffering; and then together
with patience and long ſuffering, there is <hi>contentment</hi>
without murmuring at the diſpenſation of God;<note place="margin">3. Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the ſoule that he would have it to be ſo. Hee
that hath a heart to riſe, becauſe hee hath not what hee
would have, hee doth not wait with that grace of wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that iſſueth from a right ſpring.</p>
            <p>God reſerveth joy for the time to come, for our home,
wee ſhould be content to have communion with God
and the ſoules of perfect men; and not murmure though
God exerciſeth us with many croſſes here. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Scripture calleth it a <hi>ſilence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. Silence from murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> 
               <hi>In ſilence and in

to God in this waiting condition, and this ſilence quells
all riſings in the ſoule preſently: As <hi>David, my ſoule
kept ſilence unto the Lord.</hi> It will ſtill all riſings of the
heart, iſſuing from a reſignation of the ſoule to God, to
doe as he will have us to doe: So it implieth patience
and long ſuffering, contentment, holy ſilence, without
murmuring and repining.</p>
            <p>And then it implies <hi>watchfulneſſe</hi> over our ſelves,<note place="margin">5. Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> (till
wee come to the full accompliſhment of the promiſes)
that we carry not our ſelves unworthily in the meane

in wickedneſſe, to fetch ſorrow from the devill,
and the world to comfortus, or to be beholding to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
This is no waiting, but murmuring, and rebellion,
when in croſſes and diſcomforts we cannot be content,
but muſt be beholding to the Devill: ſo there muſt bee
watchfulneſſe;<note place="margin">6. Fruitfulnes.</note> and not onely ſo, but fruitfulneſſe in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:117791:68"/>
waiting. For he waits, that waiteth in doing good,
that waiteth in obſervance; hee waiteth for his Maſters
comming, that is, doing his duty all the time in a fruitfull
courſe of obſervance and obedience; elſe it is no wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
waiting is not meerly a diſtance of time, but a
filling up of that time with all gracious carriage, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and with ſilence, with long ſuffering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
and watchfulneſſe wee take not any ill courſe,
and obſervance, and with fruitfulneſſe, that wee may fill
up times of waiting, till performance, with all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that we may have communion with God.</p>
            <p>It is another manner of grace then the world thinks.<note place="margin">Want of wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the cauſe of wickednes.</note>
What is the reaſon of all the wickedneſſe of the world,
and barrenneſſe, and voluptuouſneſſe, but becauſe they
have not learned to wait? They heare of good things,
and precious things promiſed; but they would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
payment, they will have ſomthing in hand. As <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
ſonne, ſonne, thou haſt had thy good things here;</hi> they
will have their good things here. And what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of wickedneſſe, but becauſe they will have preſent
pleaſures of ſinnes. Wee muſt preferre the afflictions
of Chriſt before the pleaſures of ſin. Now that ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of ſpirit to have reward here, is the cauſe of all
ſinne: They have no hope, nor obedience, nor expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to endure the continuance of diuturnity; where then
is patience, and hope, and contentment?</p>
            <p>The character of a Chriſtian is, that he is in a waiting
condition, and hath the grace of waiting; others will
have the pleaſures of ſin, their profits and contentments,
elſe they will cracke their conſciences, and ſell Chriſt,
God, heaven, and all.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian as he hath excellent things above the world,
ſo he hath the grace of expectation, and all the graces
that ſtore up, and maintain that expectation till the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
come.<note place="margin">Many rubs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and heaven.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore it is an hard thing to be a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
another thing then the world taketh it to be: For
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:117791:68"/>
marke I beſeech you, what is between us and heaven,
that wee muſt goe through, if ever wee will come there:
Between us and heaven, the thing promiſed, there be
many <hi>Croſſes</hi> to be met withall, and they muſt be borne,
and borne as a Chriſtian ſhould doe; <hi>Through many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
we muſt enter into the kingdome of Heaven.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
croſſes, there be <hi>ſcandalous offences,</hi> that be enough
to drive us from profeſſion of Religion without grace.
Sometimes good men by their failings, and fallings out,
they fall into ſinne, and fall out; and that is a ſcandall
to wicked men. Oh ſay they, who would be of this
Religion, when they cannot agree among themſelves:
This is a great hinderance and ſtop. It is a ſcandall and
rubbe in the way, not ſo much in themſelves; wee are
full of ſcandall our ſelves, catch at any thing, that we may
except againſt the beſt waies; there is a root of ſcandall
in the hearts of all, becauſe men will not goe to hell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reaſon.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe wee are eaſie to take offence, rather
then wee will be damned without reaſon, it is not eaſie
to hold out. Beſides this, Satan plies it with his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
from affliction, and from ſcandall; he amplifies
theſe things in the fancy: who would be a Chriſtian?
Yee ſee what their profeſſion is; And ſo hee maketh the
way the more difficult.</p>
            <p>And then againe,<note place="margin">We are of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> looke at our owne diſpoſition to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
to hold out, to fix; there is an unſetledneſſe, which
is a proper infirmity in our natures ſince the fall: we love
variety, wee are inconſtant, and cannot fix our ſelves
upon the beſt things, and wee are impatient of ſuffering
any thing. Wee are not onely indiſpoſed to doe good,
but more indiſpoſed to ſuffer any ill; the ſpirit muſt
helpe us over all this, which muſt continue all our life
long, till wee be in heaven, ſomething or other will be in
our way: now the Spirit of God muſt helpe us over all
theſe afflictions. We ſhall never come to heaven to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
afflictions, and ſcandals, and temptation, which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:117791:69"/>
plies us here withall.<note place="margin">Its hard to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of time.</note> And then to overcome the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe
of time; this needeth a great deale of ſtrength:
now this grace of expectance doth all. And therefore
it is ſo oftentimes ſtood upon in Scripture;<note place="margin">All to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by waiting.</note> in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
and in the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> how often is it repeated, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. laſt,
<hi>Wait on the Lord, if he tarry wait thou.</hi> The Lord will
wait for them that wait for him; and it is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in Scripture of a Chriſtian. <hi>Moſes,</hi> he ſaith, ſuch
as waited for the conſolation of Iſraell before Chriſt
came in the fleſh, ſuch a one, is one that waiteth for the
conſolation of Iſraell. To have a gracious diſpoſition,
and a grace of waiting was the character of good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Now ſince the comming of Chriſt, the character
of the New Teſtament, is, to wait for Chriſts appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
<hi>There is a Crowne of glory for me, and not onely
for me, but for all them that love his appearance.</hi> That
is an ingredient in waiting, when we love the thing we
wait for. And ſo <hi>Titus</hi> 2. laſt, <hi>The grace of God
that teacheth to deny ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and to
live holily, and juſtly, and ſoberly in this preſent evill world,
looking for, and waiting for this glorious appearing of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that looking with the eye of the ſoule, partly on
the firſt comming of Chriſt, which was to redeeme our
ſoules, and partly upon the ſecond, which is to redeeme
our bodies from corruption, and to make both ſoule and
body happy, it makes a man a good Chriſtian: For
the grace of God on the firſt, teacheth us to deny ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe;
and looking for Chriſts appearing, maketh us
zealous of good workes. You have ſcarce any Epiſtle,
but you have time deſcribed for looking for the comming
of Chriſt; As <hi>Jude, Preſerve your ſelves in the love of
God and wait for the comming of Chriſt.</hi> So that as
there be gracious promiſes, and a long day for them,
God vouchſafeth grace to wait for the accompliſhment
of them.</p>
            <p>Now as God giveth grace to wait, ſo he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:117791:69"/>
what wee waite for; As they ſay here, <hi>wee
have waited,</hi> that is the ſpeech of enjoying. God will
at length make good what hee hath promiſed; and
what his truth hath promiſed, his power will performe.
Goodneſſe inclineth to make a promiſe, truth ſpeakes it,
and power performeth it. As you ſhall ſee here.</p>
            <q>Wee have waited, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>In God there is a mouth of truth, a heart of pitty, and
an hand of power; theſe three meeting together, make
good whatſoever is promiſed: <hi>Hee will fulfill the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of them that feare him.</hi> The deſires that God hath
put into his Children, they be kindled from heaven; and
he will ſatisfie them all out of his bowells of pitty and
compaſſion: hee will not ſuffer the creature to be all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
under the racke of deſire, under the racke of
expectation, but hee will fulfill the deſire of them that
feare him. And therefore learne this for the time to
come.</p>
            <p>Though wee waite,<note place="margin">God will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to them that wait.</note> God will performe whatſoever
wee waite for; And therefore, <hi>loe, wee have waited for
him.</hi> As there is a time of promiſing, ſo there is a time
of performing; as there is a ſeed time, ſo there is a
time of harveſt. There is a ſuccesſion in nature, and a
ſuccesſion in grace; as the day followeth the night, and
the Sabbath the weeke, and the Jubile ſuch a terme of
yeares; and as the triumph followeth the warre; and
as the Conſummation of Marriage followeth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract;
ſo it is a happy and glorious condition, above all
conditions here on earth. Therefore in this text you
have not onely the ſeed time of the Chriſtian; wee may
ſow in teares, and an expectation, as in ſowing: But
here is likewiſe the harveſt of a Chriſtian; as there is
time of ſowing, ſo there is time of reaping; as time of
waiting, ſo of injoying. Wee have waited, and now loe,
we have what we waited for.</p>
            <p>But why doth not the Holy Ghoſt ſet downe a certain
time,<note place="margin">God keeps times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in his own power.</note> but leaveth it indefinite, <hi>In that day.</hi> God keepes
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:117791:70"/>
times and ſeaſons in his owne power; the point of
time in generall he leaveth it, There is a day; but the
point and moment of time he keepeth in his owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
It is enough to know there is a day, and a day that
will come in the beſt ſeaſon; Gods times is the beſt time.
When judgments were threatned upon the wicked, they
ſay, <hi>Let us eate, and drinke, for to morrow wee ſhall die.</hi>
So <hi>Saul, to morrow thou ſhalt die,</hi> and was he the better?
So where there is a certain time of Gods comming in
judgement, godly men would not be the worſe, and
wicked men never the better. Thetefore God reſerveth
it indefinite, <hi>In that day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a day,<note place="margin">There is a glorious day yet for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> and it is a glorious day, a day of all
dayes, a day that never will have night, a day that we
ſhould thinke of every day; <hi>That day,</hi> by way of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.<note place="margin">There be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular dayes of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance in this life.</note>
And before that day there be particular dayes in
this world, wherein God ſheweth himſelfe, and fulfills
the expectation of his children, to cheriſh the grand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of life everlaſting. As in times of trouble they
expect of God, and wait for deliverance in Gods time,
and they muſt be able to ſay, <hi>Loe, wee have waited</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is a beginning and pledge of the great perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
that ſhall be conſummate at that great day, and
of all the miſeries that ſhall then be removed: So there is
a day when the Jewes ſhall be converted, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Gentiles brought in, and the man of ſinne
diſcovered, and conſumed by the breath of Chriſt. And
when the Church of God ſeeth them, they may ſay,
<hi>Loe, we have waited for the Lord,</hi> and loe, hee is come,
that we looked for is now fulfilled: So that God reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not the fulfilling of all the promiſes to the great day
of all dayes, but even in this life hee will have a <hi>that day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it were very good for Chriſtians in the paſſages
of their lives,<note place="margin">Good to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what dayes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance God gives in.</note> to ſee how God anſwereth their prayers,
and delivereth them. Let them doe as the Saints in the
Old Teſtament, that gave names to places where they
ſaw God; As <hi>Penuell</hi> hee ſhall ſee God, and <hi>Abraham,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:117791:70"/>
God will be ſeen in the Mount.</hi> So <hi>Sampſon</hi> and others
they gave names to places where they had deliverance,
that they might be moved to bee thankfull. A Chriſtian
taketh in all the comforts of this life to believe the things
of the laſt great day. <hi>Loe, we have waited for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſhall be a time of ſight, and fruition, of full pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and full joy, which is reſerved for heaven; then we
ſhall ſay, <hi>Loe, behold this is the Lord.</hi> The more we ſee
God here, the more wee ſhall ſee him hereafter. There
be many wayes of ſeeing, ſo as to ſay, <hi>Loe, this is the
Lord.</hi> We may ſay from the pooreſt creature, <hi>Loe this is
the Lord,</hi> here are beams of his Majeſty in the works of his
Juſtice and Mercy, <hi>Loe here is the Lord.</hi> The Lord hath
brought mighty things to paſſe, the Lord is marvailous lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to this Children. <hi>Behold and ſee the ſalvation of the
Lord.</hi> We may ſay, <hi>Loe here,</hi> and ſee ſomething of God in
every creature, no creature but hath ſomething of God.
The things that have but meere being, have ſomething
of God; but the things that have life have more of God:
And ſo in ſome there is more, in ſome leſſe of God.</p>
            <p>But in the Church of God ſpecially, wee may ſee his
going in the Sanctuary; Loe this God hath done for his
Church. And in the Sacraments we may ſay, I have ſeen
the Lord, and felt the Lord in his Ordinance by his holy
Spirit. Wee doe all this before we come to ſee him in
heaven: but that is not meant ſpecially.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſay, <hi>Loe, this is the Lord,</hi> when we ſhall ſee
him in heaven, all ſight here leadeth to that ſight. Faith
hath a ſight here, but it is in the Word and Sacrament, and
ſo imperfect; but the ſight in heaven is immediate and
perfect, and therefore oppoſed to faith. VVee live by
faith, and not by ſight, in heaven we ſhall live by ſight;
not that we live not by ſight here in ſome degree, for
the leſſer ſight leadeth to the greater ſight, But in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of ſight in heaven, there is no ſight.<note place="margin">A ſight of God comparative here.</note> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſpeaketh of ſight of God comparatively: <hi>Moſes
ſaw God,</hi> that is, more than any other: And <hi>Jacob ſaw
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:117791:71"/>
God,</hi> that is, comparatively more than before, but not
fully and wholly. VVee can apprehend him, but not
comprehend him, as they ſay; wee may ſee ſomething
of it,<note place="margin">Abſolute in heaven.</note> but not wholly: but in heaven we ſhall have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſight of God, and then wee ſhall ſay, <hi>Loe, this is
the God we have waited for;</hi> wee ſhall ſee Chriſt face to
face.</p>
            <p>Beloved, that is the ſight indeed. And if yee will
aske me whether wee ſhall ſee God then or no; Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what I ſaid before, this is the God wee have wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for in obedience, and fruitfully.</p>
            <p>If we ſhall be raviſhed with the ſight of God, ſurely
if we ſee him here we may ſee him there: VVe ſee him
with the eye of faith, we ſee him in the Ordinance, wee
have ſome ſight of God that the world hath not, God
diſcovereth himſelfe to his children, more than to the
world, And therefore they ſay, <hi>thou revealeſt thy ſelf
to us, not unto the world.</hi> A Chriſtian wonders that
God ſhould reveale his love, and mercy, and goodneſſe to
him, more than to others. And therefore if wee belong
to God, and ſhall ſee him hereafter, wee muſt ſee him
now, as we may ſee him, we muſt have ſome knowledge
of him: And if wee ſee God any way, all things in the
world will be thought of no requeſt in compariſon of
the Communion of God in Chriſt. As <hi>Iſaiah 14. We
have ſeen the Lord, and what have wee to doe with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols?</hi>
The ſoule that hath ſeene Chriſt, growes in
deteſtation of ſinne, and loatheth all things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.</p>
            <p>And then againe, if we ſhall ever ſee God in glory,
in this glorious and triumphing manner, <hi>This is the Lord,</hi>
This ſight is a changing ſight. There is no ſight of God,
but it changeth, and alters to the likeneſſe of God. When
he calls to look up to him, and he looks on us in favour and
mercy. The beſt fruit of his favour is grace, of peace,
and joy, for theſe be beames that iſſue from him, grace,
as beames from the ſunne. But where-ever God lookes
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:117791:71"/>
with any favour, there is a conformity to Chriſt, a
gracious, humble, pittifull, mercifull, obedient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
which is an earneſt of the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And there is a ſtudy of purity, of a refined diſpoſition
from the pollutions of the world; <hi>The pure in heart
ſhall ſee God,</hi> they that hope to ſee God for ever in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
will ſtudy that purity that may diſpoſe, and fit them
for heaven. And there is ſuch a gracious influence in it
that they that hope for heaven, the very hope muſt needs
helpe to purifie them.</p>
            <p>As there is grace ſuitable to waiting,<note place="margin">There's an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from the thing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold graces in waiting.</note> ſo there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
from the things hoped for, to give vigor to all
grace: As all the graces of a Chriſtian fit and inable him
for heaven; ſo hope of heaven yields life to all grace.
There is a mutuall influence into theſe things. God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth
diſcovery of theſe glorious things, to helpe us to
wait, to be patient, and fruitfull and abundant in the work
of the Lord.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> And the more wee wait fruitfully and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
and ſilently, the more wee ſee of heaven. So that
as in nature, the ſeed bringeth the tree, and the tree the
ſeed; ſo in the things of God one thing breeds another,
and that breeds that againe; ſo that waiting and grace fit
us for heaven, and the thought of heaven puts life and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
into all the graces that fit us for heaven. What is our
faith to thoſe glorious things we ſhall ſee hereafter? what
is patience, but for conſideration of that? what is
hope, but for the excellency of the object of hope?
And what were induring of troubles, if ſomething were
not in heaven to make amends for all? They help us to
come to glory, and the lively hopefull thoughts of thoſe
things, animate and enliven all the graces that fit for
heaven. If ever we ſhall hereafter poſſeſſe heaven, and
ſay, <hi>Loe, this is he we have waited for,</hi> wee muſt ſee
him here ſo, as to undervalue all things, to ſee him with
a changing ſight, for the object of glory cannot bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
but it will ſtirre up a diſpoſition ſuitable to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
if this bee not, never hope for a ſight of him in
heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:117791:72"/>
And therefore let mee intreat,<note place="margin">Wee ſhould look to the laſt end, to fit us for it.</note> and beſeech you, with
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> to look to the end, look to the maine
chance, that can come in this world, and that ſhall come
hereafter. It is wiſedome to looke to the end. A man
that buildeth an houſe, will thinke of the end, that is,
dwelling, and habitation, that he propoundeth. We are
for everlaſting communion with God; we are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
as in grace, ſo in glory. Heaven is our element, we
reſt not till then, we are in motion till then, that being
our ſtation. Then thinke often of this, never to reſt
in any intermediate Condition, becauſe we are in wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
till we come to that condition. Let us ſo carry our
ſelves, that we may ſay, this we waited for, it is the glory
wee expected. It is our wiſdome often to have the
end of our lives in our eyes that wee may bee hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to waite patiently, cheerefully, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
till the conſummation come when all promiſes
ſhall end in performance, when all that is ill, and
imperfectly good ſhall bee removed, a conſumption
of ill, and a conſummation of all good.</p>
            <p>Oh have that day in our eyes, that day of all
dayes, and the very thoughts of it will fit us for the
day. The thoughts of our end will fit and ſtirre
us up to all meanes tending to that end. Phyſicke
is good, if it tend to health: The very thoughts
of that preſcribes order, and meanes. Wee read, <hi>Seek
the Kingdome of Heaven firſt, and all other things
ſhall bee added to you.</hi> The thought of the end pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
order to all meanes, and it preſcribes meaſure,
<hi>How to uſe the World, as though I uſed it not:</hi> for
the thoughts of my end ſtirre mee up to uſe all cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſuitable to that end. And therefore the beſt wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in Chriſtians is often to prefixe the end, and
to bee content in no grace, nor comfort, as it is
in a way of imperfection, but to look upon every
grace, every comfort, every good, as it tends to
perfection. <hi>David</hi> deſired not to dwell in the Houſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:117791:72"/>
of God for ever, becauſe hee would terminate his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
in the houſe of God here, but hee aimeth at Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And ſo when the Saints of God bound and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
their deſires and contentment, it is with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the laſt day, the reſt of a Chriſtian,
beyond which they cannot goe,
even communion with
God himſelfe.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the worſt age of the Church, that the
Church may not be ſwallowed up with
fear, in the worſt times, God doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
promiſes for his people. It was
the caſe of our bleſſed Saviour himſelf
to his poore Diſciples, that they might
not be overwhelmed with ſorrow. Therefore hee addeth
Sacraments to Paſſeover, and the New Teſtament to the
Old, and all to confirme faith, knowing that our hearts
are very ſubject to be danted.</p>
            <p>The Lord promiſeth here a feaſt of fat things, and all
things pertaining to a Feaſt, the beſt of the beſt, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall
of all that may hinder joy, as taking away the vaile,
which hinders them from the ſight of it. And then death
is ſwallowed up in victory, as it is already in our head,
who is gloriouſly triumphing in heaven: And then all
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:117791:73"/>
teares ſhall be wiped from all faces. There is a viciſſitude
of things, they are now in a valley of teares, but it will
not be alwayes thus, time ſhall come when all teares ſhall
be wiped away; and the cauſe of all teares are ſorrow.
The rebukes of his people ſhall be taken away, the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall
that lyeth upon the beſt things ſhall be taken away.
The worſt things goe under a better repreſentation, and
the beſt things under a vaile, but one day as things are,
they ſhall be. The God of truth will have truth to be
cleare enough; And all this is ſealed up with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Authority that admits of no contradiction. <hi>The Lord
of Hoſts hath ſpoken it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We came the laſt day to theſe words; <hi>Loe this is our
God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wherein we may conſider firſt of all, That God hath
left to his Church rich and precious promiſes, ſuch as is
ſpoken of before. A feaſt, and removall of all hinderances
whatſoever. He not only vouchſafeth heaven when we
dye, and eternall happineſſe, but in this world in our way
he vouchſafes precious promiſes to ſupport our faith,
that we may begin heaven upon earth. What theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
are, we ſhewed the laſt day.</p>
            <p>The ſecond obſervation was, in that Gods people are
here in a ſtate of expectation. <hi>It ſhall be ſaid, loe we have
waited for him.</hi> We are in a condition of waiting while
we live in this world, becauſe we are not at home; our
ſtate requires waiting, heaven requires ſetledneſſe and
reſt: There all appetites, all deſires ſhall be ſatiated to the
full: Our eſtate here is a paſſage to a better eſtate, and
waiting is a diſpoſition fit for ſuch a condition.</p>
            <p>And in this there is good, and imperfection; good, that
we have ſomething to wait for, imperfection, that we are
to wait for it, that we have it not in fruition, and till we
be in heaven we are in a ſtate of waiting. In the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
<hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly,</hi> there is a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſtate of a Church ſet forth, but while all is done, it
hath not what it would have. We cannot be in ſuch a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:117791:74"/>
ſtate in the world, but there is place for a deſire, namely
immediate and eternall communion with Chriſt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And therefore <hi>it ſhall be ſaid in that day, loe this is
our God, we have waited for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will adde a little to this ſtate of waiting before I goe
farther.<note place="margin">God will have us continue in a ſtate of wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> God will not have our condition preſently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
but have us continue in a ſtate of waiting.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſ</hi> 1. Its his pleaſure we ſhould live by faith, not by ſight.</note> it is his pleaſure that we ſhould live by
faith, and not by ſight. We have ſence and feeling of
many things, he reſerveth not all for heaven; how many
ſweet refreſhments have we in the way? but the tenor of
our life is by faith, and not by ſight. God will have us in
ſuch a condition.</p>
            <p>Again,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. We are not yet fitted for ſight of Glory.</note> we are not fitted for ſight of the glory to come
here: our veſſels are not capable of that glory. A few
drops of that happineſſe ſo overcame <hi>Peter</hi> in the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration,
that he knew not himſelfe.</p>
            <p>God is ſo good to us that he would have us enjoy the
beſt at the laſt;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe God would have us enjoy the beſt at laſt.</note> the ſweeter is heaven, by how much the
more difficult our way thither is: Heaven is heaven, and
happineſſe is happineſſe, after a long time of waiting; For
waiting enlargeth the capacity and deſires of the ſoule to
receive more, it commendeth the happineſſe afterwards.
And therefore God keepeth the beſt for the laſt, becauſe
he will never interrupt the happineſſe of his children,
when they be in heaven, there is a baniſhment of all cauſe
of ſorrow. Hee will have a diſtinction between the
Church-militant and Triumphant: He will traine up his
children here, before he bringeth them to heaven; he
will perfume his Spouſe, and make her fit for an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
communion with him in heaven.</p>
            <p>The third thing is,<note place="margin">Waiting not an empty thing.</note> that as there be promiſes, and theſe
promiſes are not preſently fulfilled, which put us in a
ſtate of waiting: ſo God giveth grace to uphold in wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
Waiting is not an empty time, to wait ſo long, and no
grace in the meane time; but waiting is a fitting time for
that we are to receive afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:117791:74"/>
We ſee in nature,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> In the winter, which is a dull time
to the ſpring, and harveſt, and the times are very cold; yet
it ripens and mellowes the ſoile, and fits it for the ſpring.
There is a great promotion of harveſt in winter, it is not
a meere diſtance of time: ſo between the promiſe and
heaven it ſelfe, it is not a meere waiting time, and there is
an end; but it is a time which is taken up by the ſpirit of
God in preparing the heart in ſubduing all baſe luſts, and
in taking us off from our ſelves, and whatſoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to heaven. The time is filled up with a great deale
of that which fits us for glory in heaven. The gracious
God that fits us for heaven,<note place="margin">God fits hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for us, and us for heaven.</note> and heaven for us, fits us with
all graces neceſſary for that condition. As faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
patience to wait for, and to depend on that which
he ſeeth not to be above ſence; a grace of hope to wait
for that which he believeth to be an anchor to his ſoule
in all conditions whatſoever: And then a grace of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to wait meekly all the while: And then long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering
patience lengthened out. As the tediouſneſſe is
long between us and heaven, ſo there be lengthening
graces. We would have all preſently, <hi>How long Lord,
how long.</hi> We are ſo ſhort, even <hi>David</hi> and others, and
therefore God giveth grace to hold out and lengthen our
ſpirituall faith, and hope and perſeverance, and conſtant
courage to encounter with all difficulties in the way.
When the ſpirit of a man beholds heaven, and happines,
and God, it makes him conſtant in ſome ſort, as the things
he beholdeth, for the ſpirit transformeth him to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
Now he beholds a conſtant Covenant: And as
faith looks upon a conſtant God, conſtant happineſſe,
and conſtant promiſes, it frameth the ſoule ſuitable to the
excellency of the object it layeth hold upon.</p>
            <p>And then the ſpirit of God in the way to heaven, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth
all evill murmurings, and exceptions, in ſuffering
us not to put forth our hands to any iniquity, though we
have not what we would have, he keeps us in a good
and fruitfull way; for to wait, is not only to endure, but
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:117791:75"/>
to endure in a good courſe, fitting us for happineſſe, till
grace end in glory.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, God will performe all his promiſes
in time. As the Church ſaith here, <hi>This is the Lord, we
have waited for him.</hi> Now he hath made good what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he hath ſaid.</p>
            <p>To inlarge this point a little.<note place="margin">As there is a time of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo there will be a time of performing.</note> As there is a time of
waiting, ſo there will be a time when Gods people ſhall
ſay, <hi>Lee this is the Lord, we have waited for him.</hi> Why
God is Jehovah, a full and pregnant word, a word of
comfort and ſtay for the ſoule,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Reaſ.</hi> God is Jehovah.</note> in this word Jehovah.
He is a God that giveth a being to all things, and a being
to his word, and therefore what he ſaith, he will make
good: He is Lord of his word. Every mans word is, as his
nature, and power, and abilitie is, the word of a man, or
the word of an honeſt man, but being the word of a God,
he will make all good.</p>
            <p>And then he will make all good,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. God is faithfull.</note> becauſe he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. He hath bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people.</note>
God, he ſaith it, and he will doe it, you need no more
reaſon then pitty to his people, his bowels of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
the hearts of people would faile, if he ſhould ſtay
too long. And therefore out of his bowels in his time,
which is the beſt time, not only becauſe he is faithfull, but
becauſe he is loving and pittifull, he will make good all
his promiſes. And then he will doe it; for what is grace,
but an earneſt of that fulneſſe we ſhall have in heaven?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſ</hi> 4. Becauſe the grace we have, is but an earneſt of what we ſhall have.</note>
What is peace here, but an earneſt of that peace in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
And what is joy here, but an earneſt of fulneſſe of
joy for evermore? And wil God loſe his earneſt? Therfore
we ſhall enjoy what God hath promiſed, and we expect,
becauſe we have the earneſt. It is not a pledge only, for a
pledge may be taken away, but an earneſt w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, but is made up in the full bargain. Grace is made
up in glory, as beginnings are made up with perfection.
Where God layeth a foundation, he will perfect it. Where
God giveth the firſt fruits, he will give the harveſt.</p>
            <p>But it will be a long time before, becauſe he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:117791:75"/>
all grace to the uttermoſt. You ſee how <hi>Abraham</hi>
was brought to the laſt. In the mountaine God provideth
for a ſacrifice, when the knife was ready to ſeiſe on
<hi>Iſaacks</hi> throat.</p>
            <p>We ſhould anſwer with our faith Gods dealing,<note place="margin">Our faith ſhould anſwer Gods dealing.</note> that
is, if God deferre let us wait, yea wait to the uttermoſt,
wait to death. He is our God to death, and in death, and
for ever. If God performe his promiſe at the worſt, then,
till we are at the loweſt we muſt wait.</p>
            <p>And therefore one character of a child of God from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
is this.<note place="margin">Waiting the character of Gods people.</note> Give me the preſent, ſaith the carnall beaſtly
man, the world, but Gods people are content to wait, he
knoweth what he hath in promiſe is better then what
he hath in poſſeſſion. The gleanings of Gods people are
better then the others harveſt. The other cannot wait, but
muſt have preſent payment: Gods child can wait, for he
liveth by faith. And therefore we ſhould learne patiently
to wait for the performance of all Gods promiſes.</p>
            <p>And to direct a little in that,<note place="margin">Directions to help waiting.</note> remember ſome rules,
which every man may gather to himſelfe,<note place="margin">1 Gods time is the beſt time.</note> as Gods time
is the beſt time. <hi>Deus eſt optimus arbiter opportunitatis,</hi>
The beſt deſcerner of opportunities. And, <hi>in the mountain
will God be ſeen.</hi> Though he tarry long, he will come, and
not tarry over-long, and then all the ſtrength of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
is with God: <hi>Robur hoſtium apud Deum,</hi> The
ſtrength of the enemy is in his hand, he can ſuſpend it
when he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Then though God ſeemes to carry things by contrary
wayes to that he promiſeth,<note place="margin">2 God will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect things, though by contraries.</note> which makes waiting ſo
difficult, yet he will bring things about at laſt. He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
happineſſe, and there is nothing but miſery; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
forgiveneſſe, and opens the conſcience to cry out
of ſinne. I but <hi>Luthers</hi> rule is exceeding good in this
caſe; <hi>Summaars,</hi> the greateſt art of a Chriſtian is, <hi>credere
credibilia,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; ſperare dilata,</hi> to hope for things a long
time, and to beleeve God when he ſeemeth contrary to
himſelfe in his promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:117791:76"/>
But though God doth deferre, yet in that day he doth
performe, it is ſet downe indefinitely, for it is not fit we
ſhould not be acquainted with the particular time. And
therefore he ſaith,<note place="margin">Times are in Gods hands.</note> in that day, he ſets not downe a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
time, but in that day wherein he meaneth to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in the performance of his promiſe. There is a time,
and a ſet time, and there is a ſhort time too, in regard of
God, and a fit time. If the time were ſhorter then God
hath appointed, then it were too ſhort, if longer, too long.
<hi>My times,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, are in thy hands.</hi> If they were in
the enemies hands, we ſhould never be out: If in our
owne, we would never enter: If in our friends, their
good will would be more then their ability. <hi>But my times,</hi>
he ſaith not, <hi>my time, but my times are in thy hands,</hi> that
is, my times of trouble, and times of waiting. And it is
well they be in Gods hands, for he hath a day and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
day, and a fit day to anſwer the waiting of all his
people.</p>
            <p>And when that day is come, you ſee how their hearts
are inlarged, they will ſay, <hi>This is the Lord, we have wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God meaneth to performe his promiſe either
in this world, or in the world to come, the world to come
ſpecially, when there ſhall be conſummation of all promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
God ſhall inlarge the hearts of his people. <hi>This is the
Lord, we have waited for him, This is the Lord;</hi> he repeats
it againe and againe.</p>
            <p>Our ſoule is very capable being a ſpirituall ſubſtance,
and then God ſhall fill the ſoule, and make it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
miſery, or comprehend happineſſe, when every
corner of the ſoule ſhall be filled, and then having bodies
too, it is fit they ſhould have a part; ſo the whole man

            <p>For the nature of the thing it cannot be otherwiſe, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

ſay of every member, doe thy office in glorifying the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:117791:76"/>
Lord, and rejoycing in the Lord: <hi>Pectus facit diſertos,</hi>
The heart makes a man eloquent and full: ſo the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of any promiſe fils the heart ſo full of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the affections are ſo inlarged, and therefore we muſt
not have affections to a Court-kind of expreſſions, as
they in old time, and the like Court-eloquence, when
men might not ſpeake fully. But when joy poſſeſſeth the
heart to the full, there be full expreſſions. <hi>This is the
Lord, this is the Lord, let us rejoyce in him.</hi> And therefore
there ſeemeth ſo many tautologies in the Pſalmes,
though they be no tautologies, but meere exuberancies of
a ſanctified affection.</p>
            <p>Oh beloved what a bleſſed time will that be, when
this large heart of ours ſhall have that that will fill it!
When the beſt parts of us, our underſtanding, will and
affections ſhall be carried to that which is better and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then it ſelfe, and ſhall be as it were ſwallowed up in
the fulneſſe of God! And that is the reaſon of the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of the word, <hi>This is the Lord, this is the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it followeth, <hi>We will rejoyce and be glad in his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
When a gracious heart is full of joy, how doth
he expreſſe that joy! A wicked heart, when it is full of
joy, is like a dirty river that runs over the banks, and
carrieth a deale of filth with it, dirty expreſſions. But
when a gracious heart expreſſeth it ſelfe being full of
joy, it expreſſeth it ſelfe in thanks and praiſes, in ſtirring
up of others: Loe this is our God, we will rejoyce and be
glad in his ſalvation.<note place="margin">There's ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble action for every affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note>

cauſe of joy? let him ſing; there is action for every affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

up to begin the imployment in heaven, on earth here.

<hi>Our converſation is in heaven,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle:
And what is the greateſt part of a Chriſtians converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but in all things to give thankes. Here the Holy
Church ſaith, their matter of praiſe was too big for their
ſoule, and therefore they brake out in this manner. And
ſo oftentimes a child of God, his heart is ſo full, that it is
too big for his body in the expreſſion of matter of praiſe.
But it is his comfort, that in heaven he ſhall have a large
heart, anſwerable to the large occaſion of praiſe. I will
not inlarge my ſelf in the common place of thanks-give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>In this condition we can never be miſerable, for it
ſprings from joy, and joy diſpoſeth a man to thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and upon thankfulneſſe there is peace, and can we
be miſerable in peace of conſceince? Therefore ſaith the
Apoſtle, <hi>in all things give thanks, and let your requeſts be
made knowne to God,</hi> and what will follow upon that,
when I have made knowne my requeſts and paid my
tribute of thanks? <hi>then the peace of God which paſſeth
underſtanding ſhall guide your minde.</hi> When we have
paid to God the tribute we can pay him, then the ſoule,
as having diſcharged a debt, is at peace. I have prayed
to God, I have laid my petition in his boſome, I am not
in arrerages for former favours, <hi>therefore the peace of
God which paſſeth all underſtanding ſhall keepe your hearts
and mindes.</hi> Hanna had prayed once, went not away
but prayed againe; the happineſſe of heaven followeth
the actions of heaven, praiſings being the maine imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of heaven, the happineſſe and comfort of heaven
followeth.</p>
            <p>And howſoever theſe promiſes be fulfilled in heaven,
yet they have a graduall performance on earth; For he
ſpeaks certainly of the ſtate of the Jewes yet to come,
wherein there ſhall be accompliſhment of all theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>

The begining of a Chriſtian, and midſt, is to hope for

            <p>Beloved,<note place="margin">We ought to treaſure up experiences.</note> we are too backward that way to treaſure
up the benefit of experience; there be few of yeares, but
might make ſtories of Gods gratious dealings with them,
if all were kept; the comforts paſt, and for time to come,

Goe along with Gods favours, and uſe them as argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

            <p>
               <hi>We have have waited for him, he will ſave us, we have
waited for him, and we will rejoyce in his ſalvation.</hi> That
which a child of God gives thanks for, &amp; rejoyces in, and
labors for, is more &amp; more experience of his ſalvation. <hi>We
wil rejoyce in his ſalvation.</hi> There is not a ſtronger word in
all the Scripture, nor in nature, he doth not ſay rejoycing
in this or that benefit, but in his ſalvation, that is in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from all evill; we will reioyce in his perſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when he hath delivered us, we will reioyce in his
advancement of us, and we will reioyce in his ſalvation.
And therfore when the wiſedome of heaven would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all in one word, hee uſeth the word <hi>Jeſus,</hi> all
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:117791:78"/>
happineſſe in that word, that pregnant full word, a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that Gods carriage towards his children is Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">Gods carriage towards his children is ſalvation.</note>
He is the God of Salvation, or a ſaving God. And
God ſent his name from heaven, and the Angels brought
it, the name of <hi>JESUS.</hi> Therefore looke to the full
ſenſe of it. We have a Saviour that will anſwer his
name, as he is <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſo he will ſave his people from their
ſinnes; And therefore we will reioyce in his ſalvation.
God dealt with us like a God, when he delivered us from
all miſery, from all ſinnes, and advanced us to all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
that nature is capable of, As he ſaid before, he
will wipe away all teares from all faces, and take away
the rebukes of all people. He will puniſh the wicked
with eternall deſtruction. And if he advanceth a people
he will be ſalvation, then which he can ſay no more.</p>
            <p>And this ſheweth that the children of God rejoyce
more then in any thing elſe in ſalvation, becauſe it is the
ſalvation of God, and becauſe God is ſalvation it ſelfe.
Heaven were not heaven, if <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> in our nature
were not there; And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I deſire
to depart,</hi> not to be diſſolved, <hi>and to be with Chriſt, for that
is better.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Our joy and happineſſe is in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</note> The ſight of God, ſpecially in our nature, God
the ſecond perſon taking our nature, that we might be
happy, will make us happy for ever. In loving God, and
joying in God, and enjoying God, makes full happineſſe;
but that is not the cauſe of joy in heaven, but the cauſe
of all, is Gods influence into us. Here in the world hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
is mediate, in Gods revealing of himſelfe to us, by
his holy ſpirit in the uſe of meanes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his dealings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances,
letting us ſee him by his grace, to ſee him, and
joy and delight in him for ever. It is no good love that
reſteth in any bleſſings of God for themſelves. It is an
harlottry affection, to love the gift more then the giver:
So the Saints of God they doe all deſire to ſee him as
they may, and to joy in God, and enjoy God himſelfe,
and to ſee God in our nature, and to be with him for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:117791:78"/>
ever. Before he ſpake of a feaſt, and if the Feaſt-maker
be not there, what is all? In a Funerall feaſt there is much
cheere, but the Feaſt-maker is gone. In heaven there is
joy, but where is God, where is Chriſt, he that hath done
ſo much, ſuffered ſo much for us, that hath taken poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of heaven, and keepeth a place for us there? What is
heaven without him? ſalvation ſevered from him is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſay when we are there, Loe here is <hi>David,
Abraham,</hi> Saint <hi>John,</hi> here the <hi>Martyrs.</hi> I but here is
Chriſt, here is God, here is our Saviour the cauſe of all,
and the ſeeing of him in them, that he will be glorious in
his Saints, that maketh us rejoyce. We ſhall ſee all our

            <p>The words are expreſſed with a kind of glorying,<note place="margin">The joy of a Chriſtian ends in glorying.</note> 
               <hi>Loe,
this is our God.</hi> So that the joy of a Chriſtian endeth in
glory, and in the higheſt degree of glory. As you have
it, Rom. 5. <hi>We glory alſo in tribulation, we glory in hope
of glory,</hi> nay we glory in God as ours reconciled. And if
we glory in him now as a God reconciled, what ſhall we
doe in heaven? Can a worlding glory in his riches, his
greatneſſe, his favour from ſuch a man, as <hi>Haman</hi> did?
And ſhall not a Chriſtian glory in his God? and make
his boaſt in his God?<note place="margin">Begin to glory in God here.</note> And therefore in this world wee
ſhould learne to glory, before we come to that glory
in heaven, ſpecially when we be ſet upon by any thing
that is apt to diſcourage us, glory then in our head; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a Chriſtian hath no wealth, no great rents to glory
in, I but he hath a God to glory in, let him glory in him.
The world may take all elſe from him, but not his God.
As the Church in Cant. 5. The virgins put the Church to
deſcribe her beloved, <hi>what is thy beloved more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beloved? My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt
of</hi> 10000. Then ſhe goeth on in particulars, <hi>my beloved is
thus and thus,</hi> and if you would know what my belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is, this is my beloved. So a Chriſtian that hath a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:117791:79"/>
of faith, ſhould glory in God here, for heaven is begun
here, and he ſhould glory in Chriſt is Saviour, and ſhould
ſet Chriſt againſt all diſcouragements, and oppoſitions; if
you will know what is my beloved, <hi>this is my beloved,
the chiefe among ten thouſands.</hi> Pſal. 115. <hi>Our God is in
heaven, and doth whatſoever he pleaſeth in heaven, and
earth, and the deepes,</hi> yea we make our boaſt of God ſaith
the Pſalmiſt, when there is occaſion; <hi>this is the Lord, this
is our God, we have waited for him;</hi> ſpecially in times of
afflictions, and what is the reaſon? This will hold out
to eternity. <hi>This is our God.</hi> As in the Revelations, It is a
plea, and a glory for ever; for God is our happineſſe. As
the School-men ſay, he is our <hi>objective happineſſe,</hi> and
<hi>our formall happineſſe,</hi> he is our happineſſe, as he is ours.
And he is ours, in life, and death, and for ever, ſo there is
alwayes ground of glory, onely God doth diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be ours, by little and little, as we are able to beare
him; he is ours in our worſt times. <hi>My God my God why
haſt thou forſaken me? yet my God ſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is our God to death, and hee is ours in heaven.
<hi>This is our God, we will rejoyce in him.</hi> And therefore well
may we boaſt of God, becauſe in God is everlaſting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
If we boaſted in any thing elſe, our boaſting
would determine with the thing it ſelf, but if we rejoyce
in God, we rejoyce in that which is of equall Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with our ſoules, and goeth along with the ſoule to
all eternity.</p>
            <p>And therefore we ſhould learne to rejoyce in God, and
and then we ſhall never be aſhamed.<note place="margin">Intereſt in God &amp; Chriſt is the ground of all rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</note> It is ſpoken here
with a kind of exalting, a kind of triumphing over all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
<hi>Loe, this is our God.</hi> Beloved, this, that God

and of all happineſſe.<note place="margin">Therefore we are to make good that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt whilſt we are here.</note> All joy, all comfort is founded upon
this, <hi>our intereſt in God;</hi> and therefore we muſt make
this good, while we live here, that God is our God, and
that we may doe ſo, obſerve this; Chriſt is called <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuell,</hi>
God with us.<note place="margin">1 By Union.</note> God in the ſecond perſon, is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:117791:79"/>
and ſo God with us, and the Father in <hi>Emanuell</hi> is
God with us too. So we are God the Fathers, becauſe
we are his. <hi>All things are yours</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>whether
Paul, or Apollo, things preſent, things to come;</hi> why? <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you are Chriſts.</hi> I but what if I be Chriſts, Chriſt is
Gods. So we muſt be Chriſts, and then we ſhall be Gods;
if Chriſt be ours, God is ours, for God is <hi>Emanuell</hi> in
Chriſt, <hi>Emanuell,</hi> God is with us in Chriſt, who is with
us. God is reconciled to us in God and man, in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And therefore get by faith into Chriſt, and get uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and get communion, by prayer open our ſouls to him,
entertaine his ſpeeches to us by his word, and ſpirit, and
bleſſed motions, and open our ſpirits to him, and ſo
maintaine a bleſſed entercourſe. Make it good
that God is our God,<note place="margin">2 By acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him</note> by dayly acquaintance. Theſe
ſpeeches at the latter end are founded upon acquaintance
before. <hi>This is our God.</hi> Grace and glory are knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indiſſolubly. If God be our God here, he will be
ours alſo in glory, if not here, not in glory. There is a
Communion with God here, before communion with
him in glory, and therefore make it good that God be our
God here, firſt by union with him. And then maintaine
dayly acquaintance with him, by ſeeing him with the
eye of faith, by ſpeaking to him, and hearing him ſpeake
to us by his ſpirit, joyning in his ordinances; And then he
will owne us, and be acquainted with us, in heaven we
ſhall ſay, <hi>Loe, this is our God.</hi> We have had ſweet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
one with another, He by his ſpirit with me &amp;
I by my prayers with him. Our Saviour Chriſt will not be
without us in heaven, we are part of his myſticall body,
and heaven were not heaven to Chriſt, without us. With
reverence be it ſpoken, we are the fullneſſe of Chriſt, as
he is the fullneſſe of his Church.<note place="margin">The Church cannot be without Chriſt, nor Chriſt without the Church.</note> And if he ſhould want
us, in ſome ſort, he were miſerable, he having fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, as objects of his eternall love. In what caſe were
he, if he ſhould loſe that object? And therefore as we
glory in him, he gloryeth in us. <hi>Who is this that cometh
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:117791:80"/>
out of the wilderneſſe?</hi> who? <hi>his beloved.</hi> And, <hi>woman is
this thy faith?</hi> he admires the graces of the Church, as
the Church admires him, <hi>This is the Lord.</hi> The Church
cannot be without him, nor he without the Church.
Theſe words are ſpoken with a kind of admiration.<note place="margin">In heaven no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but in its admirable.</note> 
               <hi>Loe,
this is the Lord, we will rejoyce in him.</hi> So I ſay, as there is
thanks and joy, ſo their is admiration, loe, behold. This is
a God worthy beholding, &amp; ſo he wonders at the graces
of his Children. Beloved there is nothing in the world
worthy admiration. <hi>Sapientis non eſt admirare,</hi> It was a
ſpeech of the proud <hi>Philoſopher, A wiſe man will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,</hi>
for he knoweth the ground. But in heaven the parts
are lifted up ſo high, that there is nothing but matter of
admiration, <hi>things that eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor
hath entred into the heart of man to conceive of.</hi> They be
things beyond expreſſion, and nothing is fit for them,
but admiration at the great things vouchſafed to the
Church.</p>
            <p>And as with admiration ſo with invitation, that is the
nature of true thankfullneſſe; there is no envy in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
things, no man envyeth another the light of the

of all others, <hi>This is the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us therefore rejoyce beforehand, at the glorious
times to come, both to our ſelves and to others, be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and exciting one another to glory, and rejoyce in

            </p>
            <p>And therefore learne all to be ſtirred up from hence,
not to be offended with Chriſt, or with Religion. Be not
offended, ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> with the parvity of Religion. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing to the eyes of the world is little in Religion. A

conſider with the littleneſſe,<note place="margin">2 Nor offended with Religion, for there's a glory to come.</note> and baſeneſſe, and deſpiſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Church, the glory to come. Time will come

admiration, to the ſtirring up of others, <hi>Loe, this is the

Lord.</hi> And therefore ſay with our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>happy is
he that is not offended with me,</hi> nor with Religion, there
is a time coming that will make amends for all. Who in
the world can ſay at the houre of death, and day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Loe, this is my riches, this my honours? alas the
greateſt perſons muſt ſtand naked to give account, all
muſt ſtand on even ground to hold up their hands at the

man, loe this is the man that put his confidence in his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
And none but reconciled Chriſtians can ſay, <hi>loe
this is our God.</hi> Therefore take heed of being offended
with any thing in Religion.</p>
            <p>Againe if time to come be ſo tranſcendently glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,<note place="margin">3 Be not afraid to dye, for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is our reſt and center.</note>
let us not be affraid to dye, let us not be over much
caſt downe, for it ſhall end in glory. And let us be in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
ſtill of good times, waite for this bleſſed time
to come, and never be content with any condition, ſo
as to ſet up our reſt here. We may write upon every
thing, <hi>Hic non eſt requies veſtra;</hi> Our reſt is behind, theſe
things are in paſſage. And therefore reſt content with
nothing here. Heaven is our centre, our element, our
happineſſe, and every thing is contentedly happy, and
thriveth in its Element; The birds in the aire, the fiſh in
in the ſea, beaſts on the earth, they reſt there as in their
center: And that that is our place for ever, it is heaven, it is
God. The immediat injoying of God in heaven, that is our
reſt, our Element, and we ſhall never reſt till we be there.
And therefore he is befooled for it, in the Goſpell, that
ſetteth up his reſt here; whoſoever ſaith I have enough,
and will now take contentment in them, he is a foole.
There is a reſt for Gods people, but it is not here.</p>
            <p>Neither reſt in any meaſure of grace,<note place="margin">4 Neither reſt in any meaſure of grace or comfort here.</note> or comfort.
What is faith to ſight? we have hope an Anchor, and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
that keepeth up many a ſoule, as the Cork keepeth
from ſinking. What is this hope to the fruition of what
we hope for? Here we have love, many love tokens
from God, I, but what is love to union? Ours is but a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:117791:81"/>
love of deſire, we are but in motion here, we lye in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
onely, and our deſires are not accompliſhed, what is
this love to the accompliſhing of the union with the
thing beloved for ever? Here we have Communion of
Saints; but what is this communion of Saints, to
Communion with God for ever? We have infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
here as others, which breedeth jealouſies and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition;
I, but we ſhall have Communion in heaven, and
there ſhall be nothing in us to diſtaſt others, but everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
friendſhip; yea our Communion ſhall be with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ſoules. Our Communion of Saints here is our heaven
upon earth, but it is Communion with unperfect ſoules.
Peace we have, I, but it is peace intermixt, It is peace in
the midſt of enemies; There we ſhall have peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
enemies. Chriſt doth now rule in the midſt of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
In heaven he ſhall rule in the midſt of his friends.
So that we can imagine no condition here though never
ſo good, but it is imperfect. And therefore reſt not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing in the world, no not in any meaſure of grace,
any meaſure of Comfort, till we be in heaven, but waite
for the time to come, <hi>and rejoyce in hope by which we are
ſaved.</hi> Wait ſtill, and though we have not content here,
yet this is not our home, this is a good refreſhment by the
way. As when the Children of Iſrael came from Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
they had wells by the way, as in <hi>Michae,</hi> they dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up wells. So from Babylon to Ieruſalem we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſweet refreſhments; But they be refreſhments far off
the way. God digs many wells, we have breſts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
to comfort us, I but they are but for the way.
And therefore let us anſwer all temptations, and not take
contentment with any thing here. It is good, but it is
not our home. <hi>Cui dulcis peregrinatio non amat patriam.</hi>
If we have eternity,<note place="margin">5 Be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much dejected for the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church.</note> love heaven, we cannot be over
much taken with any thing in the way.</p>
            <p>And ſo for the Church, let us not be over much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
for the deſolation of the Church, but pray for a
ſpirit of faith, which doth realize things to the ſoule, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:117791:81"/>
preſents them as preſent to the ſoule, ſeeth <hi>Babylon</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
preſents things in the Scripture phraſe, and in the
words, <hi>Babylon is fallen,</hi> for as much as all the enemies of
the Church fall. Mighty is the Lord that hath ſpoken,
and will performe it. And as the Angell ſaith, <hi>it is
downe.</hi> So time will come ere long, when it ſhall be
ſaid, <hi>It is downe.</hi> The Church ſhall be gathered, and then,
<hi>Loe, this is our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the comfort of the beleeveing Jewes that the
Gentiles ſhould come. And why ſhould it not be the
comfort of the Gentiles that there be bleſſed times for the
ancient people of God, when they ſhall all cry, and
ſay, <hi>Loe, this is our God; We have waited for him long,
and he will ſave us.</hi> Therefore be not over much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
for whatſoever preſent deſolation the Church
lyeth under. If it were not for this, <hi>we were of all men
moſt miſerable,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. But there be times to come
when we ſhall rejoyce, and rejoyce for ever, and make
boaſt of the Lord, if it were not, <hi>we were of all men moſt
miſerable.</hi> Howſoever happineſſe is to come, yet of all
perſons he is moſt happy, that hath Chriſt and heaven.
The very fore-taſte of happineſſe is worth all the
world,<note place="margin">The fore taſte of heaven is better than all worldly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</note> the inward peace of conſcience, joy in the Holy
Ghoſt, the beginings of the Image of God, and of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
here is worth all the injoyments of the world.
Aske of any Chriſtian whether he will hang with the
greateſt worldling, and be in his condition; he would
not change his place in grace, for all his glory. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſet heaven aſide; the very firſt fruits is better, then
all the heaiveſt of the world. Let us therefore get the ſoul
raiſed by faith to ſee her happineſſe, we need it all, for till
the ſoul get a frame raiſed up to ſee its happineſſe here,
ſpecially in the world to come, it is not in a frame fit for
any ſervice, it will not ſtoop to any baſe ſinne, where the
affections are ſo poſſeſt they look upon all baſe courſes
as unworthy of their hope. What, I that hope to rejoyce
for ever with God in heaven, that am heir of heaven, that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:117791:82"/>
have the Image of God upon me, that am in Covenant
with God, to take any beaſtiall courſe, to place my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
in things meaner than my ſelfe, that have God to
delight in, a God in Covenant that hath taken me into
Covenant, with himſelfe. So I ſay in all ſolicitations to
ſinne, get our ſelves into a frame that may ſtand firme,
and immovable.</p>
            <p>In all troubles let us know we have a God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
that we may joy in him here, and rejoyce with
him in heaven for ever hereafter.</p>
