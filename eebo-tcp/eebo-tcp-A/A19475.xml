            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no Doctrine in the Church of God more neceſſary the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrine of Repentance and amendment of life; neither doth the holy Ghoſt ſo much labour in all the Scripture, as hee doth to beat repentance into mens heads.</p>
               <p>It was not only the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sermon which S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> preached, to prepare the way for Chriſt, but alſo
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16406:5"/>
it was the firſt that euer was made, it was preached by God himſelfe, to our firſt parents in Paradiſe; &amp; euer ſince both the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apoſtles, and many of Gods faithful Miniſters haue preached Repentance vnto the people.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding many are ſo wedded vnto ſinne, and they are become ſo godleſſe, ſo graceleſſe, ſo rooted and fully reſolued to liue therein, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the moſt part little vnderſtand the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Repentance, and leſſe practiſe the duty. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preſume to deſcribe it, though few know it: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can talke of it, but few walke in it; many ſpeake of it, but few feele it; and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16406:5"/>
many thinke they haue caught it, when they haue but the ſhaddow of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo ſlippery that few can hold it, and ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret that many cannot find it: it is hid from the world, and reuealed vnto none but to the elect Children of God.</p>
               <p>It is a worke that no men with their ſine heads and deepe deuices can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, for the conuerſion of a ſinner is ſupernatural. And whoſoeuer doth or hath not felt in himſelfe what repentance is, ſhalbee dammed; therefore hee that hath eares to heare, let him heare, and he that hath eyes to ſee, let him ſee what Repentance is, and withall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16406:6"/>
bring this precept of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> with him, <hi>Noſce teipſum,</hi> Know thy ſelfe; it is the firſt thing to be done in repentance, and the beginning of all grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repentance</hi> is a worke of grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ariſing of a godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, from a true faith, and knowledge of a mans own ſpirituall eſtate. It is a conſtant turning of man in his whole life from all his ſinnes, vnto God; it is an harty ſorrow for ſinne with amendment of life, hauing a godly <hi>Reſolution</hi> to ſinne no more.</p>
               <p>It is a moſt neceſſary thing for mankind; it is the very <hi>ſuperſedeas</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of ſinne, and the cauſe of vnity betweene
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16406:6"/>
God and man. There is no other means to make peace betweene Chriſt and vs, but Repentance: No other to diſcharge ſin, nor courſe to auoyde hell, but Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; neither any way to winne heauen, but Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and therefore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is moſt neceſſary.</p>
               <p>What wounded body would not ſeeke a ſalue? much more what wounded ſoule, ſlain with ſin, would not ſeeke Repentance, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is the onely ſalue to cure the ſoule?</p>
               <p>It is an Ephod of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and a defiled man may not weare it. The dignity of it is great, &amp; honorable; and the Lord will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it vpon an vnworthy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16406:7"/>
perſon. It is a magnificent gueſt, and wil not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a polluted <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> It is an holy <hi>Sainct,</hi> and will not dwell in the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of <hi>Sathan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not to bee bought with ſiluer or gold, nor to bée had from the gifts of Kings, Popes, or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates: it is a thing of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable value, it ſheweth the attonement betweene the Sauiour and the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and beeing gotten by Faith, Prayer, and hearing the Word of God, it brings thee vnto Chriſt. It is <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bera Donatio,</hi> a gift abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, without conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which God euer beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vpon his friends, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thoſe that loue him.

               <p>The true <hi>Eſſence</hi> or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thy Repentance, onely conſiſteth in turning from all thy ſinnes vnto God: and therefore it is not altogether deriued of the word <hi>Poenitentia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Diuines ſay, it doth not comprehend <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Terminum a quo et ad quem,</hi> from what, and to whom thou muſt returne.</p>

               <p>I may call Repentance a worke, becauſe it ſeemes not to bee a quality or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, but an action of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinner, ſtriuing to returne from all his ſinnes, to come vnto God: and it cannot be practiſed by any, but ſuch as are in the ſtate of Grace.</p>

               <p>To Repent, conſiſteth but of two ſyllables; yet vnto the wicked it is ſo hard to be learned, and ſo vnapt to be practiſed, that

               <p>BEfore thou confeſſe thy ſinnes vnto God, thou muſt take heede to examine thy ſelfe, that thereby thou maiſt know them both in greatneſſe and danger: for vntill thou know thy ſins, that thy conſcience may be conuicted by them, thou canſt neuer humbly &amp; harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſe them.</p>
               <p>For, let any repentant ſinner aske his conſcience, what was the firſt cauſe of his conuerſion, and ſurely he will ſay, That when hee began to repent, he did firſt ſearch himſelfe; and finding his wayes dangerous, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16406:14"/>
his cauſe feareful, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon reſolue to take a new courſe. It is the beginning of all grace, to ſearch, trie, and examine thy ſelfe. It is alſo a meanes to preuent Gods iudgement: for if thou doeſt not ſearch thy ſelfe, then God will ſearch thee with his fiery croſſes and terror of his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>But if thou truely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy ſelfe, firſt to bee guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, ſubiect to the curſe of Gods wrath.</p>
               <p>Thus in the guiltineſſe of Adams ſin, ſin hath his beginning; in the originall, his continuance; and in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16406:15"/>
actuall, his full perfection.</p>
               <p>So, anſwerable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is the wrath of God; it beginneth by leauing thée by nature vnto the ſlauery of Sathan; it is continued by death, and accompliſhed by damnation.</p>
               <p>Now theſe three rules I leaue to thy carefull conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, aſſuring thée from God, thou canſt neuer bee ſaued, vnleſſe thou repent; nor neuer repent, except thou doeſt ſearch, trie, and examine thy ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thus, if thou wilt repent truly, thou muſt ſearch and looke into thy ſelfe, to ſee in what a miſerable caſe thou art; as I haue ſaid before: and thou ſhalt find, that by nature thou art the

child of wrath, out of the fauour of God, not onely wretched and accurſed by the Law, a bond-ſlaue vnto Sathan, but finally ſubiect to death, hell, and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Thus if thou wouldſt know, if thou art in the right way of repentance, or no, thou ſhalt finde, if thou conſider in thy ſelfe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou hadſt euer any neede of Gods pardon for thy ſinne, or of Chriſt his blood, to ſalue and cure thy ſoule: Or was thy heart euer wounded or grieued for thy ſin, ſo that thy ſoule were euen ſicke with the ſtinke thereof?</p>
               <p>Or didſt thou euer hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after God in

Chriſt? and with ſighes, groanes and teares, beg for his mercy vpon thy knees (as for life and death:) If thou haſt not felt, nor done theſe things in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſurely thy caſe is very fearefull and dangerous; y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> art not yet in the way of Repentance: therefore as yet the mercies of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not vnto thee.</p>

becauſe they cannot bee truly humble &amp; repent, who confeſſe not their ſins vnto God: neither will he giue them pardon; for God couers when men vncouer and acknowledge; he iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth when men condemne themſelues, and flye vnto him for mercy.

               <p>Thou muſt alſo accuſe thy ſins, thy very conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt witneſſe againſt them, and thy heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them; thou muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them, firſt, as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers deiected; ſecondly, as aduerſaries conuicted; and thirdly, as enemies profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

               <p>Therefore confeſſe thy ſins vnto God without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excuſe or delay. For it is another manner of thing to repent then many take it for; It is not euery ſob or ſigh, that brings Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; God is mercifull, &amp;c. And thus lightly dawbe them ouer, as though Gods mercy were to be gained in a moment. Let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue himſelfe; it will coſt

               <p>If thou diddeſt feele the ſmart of ſin but pricke in thy wounded conſcience, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> wouldſt neuer giue God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſt; but like <hi>Dauid,</hi> crye vnto God againe, &amp; againe, vntill thou haſt found ſome comfortable perſwaſion of Gods mercy in Chriſt, for the forgiueneſſe of thy ſins.</p>
               <p>Untill thou doe thus, thou ſhalt neuer finde any quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in thy conſcience, nor any ſound comfort of Gods Spirit in thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> could neuer repent vntill God ſent <hi>Nathan</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; to reprooue him for his ſin: but ſo ſoone as hee
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16406:19"/>
ſaw his ſin, and that it was not onely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againſt <hi>Vriah,</hi> but alſo againſt God it preſently ſo woundes his conſcience, killed his poore heart, and ſo grieued his ſoule, that hée cryed out in his conſcience; <hi>Againſt thee O Lord, againſt thee haue I ſinned, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if he would haue ſaid, Oh my God, it grieues me exceedingly, and wounds my very ſoule, that euer I was ſo vile a ſinner as to ſinne againſt thee, O my moſt gracious and merciful God.</p>
               <p>Therefore the only way to repent, is, from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of thy heart, in thy conſcience to grieue for thy ſin; eſpecially for that it is

againſt God, and cauſeth thee to breake his Lawes; for if thou couldſt bee ſorry for thy ſin, becauſe it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, more then for fear of puniſhment it were a good ſigne that thou wert in the ready way of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if there were no ſhame nor puniſhment, no Hell nor damnation, yet thou oughteſt to repent, becauſe thou haſt ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo good and gracious a God, who hath created and redeemed thee.</p>

               <p>By manifeſtation Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce goeth before faith, for it is ſooner deſcried then faith.</p>
               <p>Regeneration is like the ſap of a trée, hid within the barke, when as Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is like the bud, that spéedily ſheweth it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>If wee reſpect the time, neither of them are one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other, but are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten both in an inſtant. So ſoone as there is fire, ſo
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16406:21"/>
ſoone it is hot: and ſo ſoone as a man is regenerate, ſo ſoone hee repents: for he that beleeues, inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. Therefore none can truly repent, except hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues that he is Gods. And none can haue beleefe, but hee that hath his grace, and faith in him.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, none can repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnleſſe they hate ſin; and faith cauſeth a man to hate ſin: now none can hate ſin, except he be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and none can be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, without hee be iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith; for faith compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth iuſtification.</p>
               <p>Againe, the inward or inſtrumentall cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is faith, which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16406:22"/>
may be called the mother of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, becauſe it brings it forth, as the Word is the begetter; and ſo may haue the name of a Father: for he that is without faith is dead. No life without faith; no repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance without life: &amp; therfore neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Phariſies Prayer, the Harlots vow,</hi> the <hi>Traitors kiſſe,</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice of Caine,</hi> the <hi>Faſt of Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi> the <hi>Oblation of Anani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> nor the <hi>Teares of Eſau,</hi> could bee accepted of God, becauſe they were not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deuoted from a liuely faith.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall working cauſe of faith in thy repentance, is God, wherby, by faith euery true beleeuer receiueth Chriſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16406:22"/>
for himſelfe, as giuen for him, borne for him, dying for him, and roſe againe for him: for hee dyed for his ſins, and roſe againe for his iuſtification.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſeparated from faith in Chriſt, is no true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>And thus much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Faith.</p>

               <head>Laſtly, the time when to repent.</head>
               <p>MAN hath no time of repentance certaine, no tearme of yeares but tearme of life, and that is moſt vncertaine.</p>
               <p>Though God called <hi>Saul</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:16406:23"/>
twice, <hi>Samuel</hi> thrice, his <hi>Spouſe</hi> foure times, the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuites</hi> forty dayes, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> forty yeares; yet hee giues vs no time to repent, but to repent now.</p>
               <p>The time of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time preſent without delay, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt teacheth: This day if you will heare his voice, harden not your hearts: for there is but one acceptable time, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being neglected, is as a Bird eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of the hand, or a ſhaft ſhot out of a bow, not to be recalled. At what time (ſaith the Lord.) The Lord limits no time, if a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent truly. The time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is double; Firſt it muſt be done preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay: Secondly, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,

euery day. It muſt bee done ſpéedily without delay: for who knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this bee the acceptable time, which if thou neglect when God calls thée in thy youth, or in thy health, it may be he will not call thee hereafter in thy age or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and the longer thou doeſt defer thy repentance, the harder it will be for thée to repent. Therefore if thou haſt ſuffered the bud of thy youth to be blaſted, thy flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to fade, thy leaues to dry vp, and thy boughes to wither, yet kéepe life in the roote, leſt the whole become fuell for hell fire.</p>

               <p>The theefe indéede may be ſaued on the Croſſe, and mercy found at the laſt; but late repentance is ſeldome or neuer true repentance. For if a man repent when he can ſin no more, then hée leaues not ſinne, but ſinne leaues him.</p>
               <p>Looke in the whole book of God, there is but onely

               <p>O what then wilt thou doe? What anſwer canſt thou make? Doeſt thou

think that God whom thou neuer regardedſt to ſerue, will then ſend his Angels to deliuer thée out of his clawes? No, no. It is iuſt and right, that thou beeing dead ſhouldſt neuer want torment, that whilſt thou liuedſt wouldeſt neuer want ſinne.</p>
               <p>According vnto Chriſts owne ſaying, <hi>Quantum in<note place="margin">Reu. 18. 7.</note> delitiis fuit, tantum dato illi tormentum:</hi> Looke how much they haue delighted in ſin, ſo much torment ſhal be laid vpon them.</p>

               <p>Or wouldeſt thou conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in thy ſinnes, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer repent, and yet thinke to haue eternall life? It is impoſſible.

               <p>Wherefore to conclude, I beſeech thée gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in the Name of Jeſus,
