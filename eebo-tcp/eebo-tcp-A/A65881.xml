            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ve not prevailed, nor ever shall effect the Enemies Designs against God's Cause or Heritage. Had they been Men of <hi>Tender Conscience,</hi> or respected the <hi>Honour of Religion</hi> more then <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi> and <hi>Popular-Fame,</hi> they would not have given us Occasion for these publick Contests, neither by <hi>abetting</hi> a <hi>manifest Forger,</hi> nor by <hi>lying Pamphlets</hi> or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106644:3"/>
               <hi>false Relations</hi> that they so frequently bring forth, and cause to be spread against us: But their hard Hearts, their fretful striving Spirits vent forth their <hi>Envy,</hi> and declare their <hi>Spleen</hi> and <hi>Ill-will</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, only that they want Power to effect their <hi>Revenge</hi> upon us; to evince this I could give divers Instances, that an <hi>Inveterate Persecuting Spirit</hi> hath long been, and yet lives and works in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of these <hi>Baptist-Teachers</hi> and <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>; such as cannot <hi>suffer Persecution</hi> themselves for their <hi>Religion,</hi> but a little <hi>Storm</hi> or small <hi>Gust</hi> would blow them into their <hi>Holes</hi> and <hi>Obscurities</hi> again, and yet they seem to envy the <hi>Liberty,</hi> and grudge the <hi>Prosperity</hi> of others; we have Cause to think, that even <hi>Ours</hi> is as an Eye-Sore to them: If they urge me herein, I doubt not but I can particularly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it, and in some Measure shew the Antiquity of their <hi>persecuting Envy</hi>; and of late their <hi>Outrage</hi> is ominous of their <hi>Decrease, Confusion</hi> and <hi>Ruin</hi>: I am sensible the secret Hand of God hath
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106644:3"/>
been, and is at Work against this Perverse Generation, because of their <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> against <hi>us</hi> his People: And how do they <hi>Revile, Infamize, Baite</hi> and <hi>Bark</hi> at that Sincere-hearted and Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Man <hi>William Penn</hi>? What <hi>Libels, Pamphlets, Books, Squibs, Cantings, Jeers, Silly Drolls and Railing</hi> have his Adversaries (<hi>Baptists</hi> and their Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stents) let fly at him, as Men full freight with <hi>Envy,</hi> by all which both <hi>He</hi> and many more are but the more confirmed against them and their Way, resolving (if they were otherwise to seek) they would never be <hi>Dipt</hi> by these <hi>Baptists</hi> into their <hi>Spirit, Religion</hi> or <hi>Church.</hi> Of late I have met with a very partial and scornful Pamphlet, styled, <hi>The Quakers Quibbles,</hi> said to be set forth in <hi>an Expostulatory Epistle to</hi> W. Penn; unto which I thought meet to write this following brief Tract; though it be not directed to me, I am concerned for the Truth and People of God, being both abused through the <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> of their Confused Adversaries: We find the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106644:4"/>
said Pamphlet subscribed with the Name, <hi>Thomas Thompson,</hi> p. <hi>26.</hi> And in Conclusion, <hi>Thomas Thompson,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be the Real Author's Name some question; however, some of the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> have commended and promoted his Work, as an <hi>Ingenuous Piece,</hi> who have pretended themselves ignorant of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it: but whatever he be, he writes like a Confident Controuler of <hi>W. P.</hi> and the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and would seem to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body; but his Complement of <hi>Sir,</hi> and <hi>thou Sir,</hi> and <hi>thou,</hi> &amp;c. as also, <hi>Mountebank, Fool,</hi> &amp;c. with much more such Language to <hi>W. P.</hi> looks but oddly; a strange Way of complementing from such a Person as would be thought a <hi>Moderator</hi> and <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Pen</hi>! But whoever the Author be, his Work will further declare what dark Spirit it came from, and that it much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles that of a <hi>Prejudiced, Angry Anabaptist,</hi> only disguised and mixed with a little of <hi>different Style</hi> and <hi>silly Drollery:</hi> However, he and these <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> that so much envy us, and out of their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106644:4"/>
               <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Emulation</hi> would be smiting at <hi>W. Penn,</hi> because of his <hi>Testimony for the Truth</hi> among us, and his <hi>Zeal</hi> against Truth's Adversaries, they do but strive and quarrel in vain; and I must tell them, there was a Hand of the Lord in raising him up (as also will appear in many more) to bear Witness against such a stingy Generation of <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Apostates,</hi> as of late do busy themselves and take Counsel together like malicious Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries against us, and their Counsel God will bring to nought, <hi>and scatter the Proud in their Imaginations</hi>; yet I have a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Sadness and Sorrow of Spirit because of the great <hi>Loss, Declension</hi> &amp; <hi>Apostacy</hi> that divers, even of these <hi>Baptists</hi> are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into. On the former <hi>Zeal for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Tenderness of Conscience</hi> and <hi>Desires after an Experimental and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Knowledge of the Spirit, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Work of God</hi> that were stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in many (when they were in a Low and Suffering Condition) which now they have lost, and the <hi>Zeal</hi> of several turned
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106644:5"/>
into <hi>Enmity,</hi> and they grown <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Dead</hi> in the Earth and Spirit of the World! yet there is a Remnant among them, whom the Lord will visit and gather out, as those other Sheep that desire to return to the great Shepherd and Sheepfold, from off those <hi>Barren Hills,</hi> and out of those <hi>Empty Professions,</hi> and <hi>Dead Forms,</hi> and <hi>Shadowy Observations</hi> under which the Souls of many yet lye starving and pining, for want of the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Heavenly Bread, which is in the Father's House.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. Between his <hi>commending</hi> W.P. <hi>for an excellent Rhetorician and fluent Tongue; and so was</hi> Cicero, p. 6.</p>

               <p>Was <hi>Cicero</hi> such an one then?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Between his proposing, that <hi>if</hi> W.

               <p>And his confessing, <hi>That good Saint</hi> Paul <hi>saith, Though I speak with the Tongues of Men and Angels, and have not Charity I am become as sounding Brass or a tinkling Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> p. 9.</p>
               <p>So then it is Charity, not the Gift of Tongues, that is a certain Proof of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Between his saying, <hi>Thou madest thy self the Author of a Lye, and shewdst thy self not only a Fool, but Vnjust,</hi> p. 13.</p>

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:106644:7"/>
And saying, <hi>To say it is a Lye, that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Answer nor Argument; therefore in Love I should advise thee to leave off all such</hi> Billins-gate <hi>Rhetorick and gross Language.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See here how he hath condemned that as <hi>Billings-gate</hi> Rhetorick and gross Language which himself hath used.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Between his saying to <hi>W.P. Perhaps thou art of a different mind from some of thy Friends as it is reported, thou hast brought them off from some ridiculous Fancies, p.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>And speaking of <hi>W.P.</hi>'s being <hi>engaged with such a People, and having received their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, thereby thinking himself oblieged now to maintain them,</hi> p. 26.</p>
               <p>How should he so differ with us (his Friends) being engaged with us, and oblieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to maintain our Principles? Which we doubt not of his Sincerity in, whatsoever be here insinuated to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Now after the great Noise these <hi>Baptists</hi> have made against us, as being no <hi>Christians,</hi> and the several Attempts made to prove us none; as also their begging Questions, and calling for an Evidence to prove our selves <hi>Christians,</hi> and not telling us what Evidence; the Author of the <hi>Quakers Quibles</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth something as Evidence, in order to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106644:7"/>
convince him of <hi>W.

Also he asketh, <hi>Where is the Demonstration of the Spirit with thee in Power and mighty Signs</hi>? p. 9.</p>
               <p>What say you <hi>Baptists</hi> to this Proposal? Must this conclude the Controversie between you and us, that if we can produce such a Sign or Evidence, it shall be taken as a Proof of our <hi>Christianity</hi>; but if not, then no <hi>Christians</hi>? And who then shall escape your Censure in this Case that have not the Gift of Tongues immediately inspired? Have not the <hi>Jesuites</hi> in this wise argued against the <hi>Protestants</hi> and reformed Churches, calling for some such Sign or Miracle to ascertain them of their being the true Church, or led by the Spirit, otherwise have urged them to return to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>?</p>
               <p>And at this rate how will you <hi>Baptists</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape your own Condemnation of being <hi>no Christians</hi> or Members of Christ's Church, if you cannot exhibit such an Evidence as the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106644:8"/>
Gift of Tongues inspired among you? But to say, <hi>the Members</hi> of the true Church (that is, in general without Exception) had that Gift, is a great Mistake (though some had) see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29, 30. And what if God will not bestow such Gifts and Signs now; must we therefore be no <hi>Christians</hi>? But <hi>for ought he can learn, our Friends and Church is as low, poor, naked and destitute herein as the</hi> Baptists <hi>Church</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> as to such former Signs and Wonders) p. 8.</p>
               <p>And what follows? Are we not therefore the true Church? Are the <hi>Baptists</hi> willing to be thus concluded on this Ground?</p>
               <p>By that Accusation (viz. <hi>Whilst you are both in the dark, you wrangle and fight, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute and confound one another to little Purpose, p.</hi> 8.) He hath condemned the <hi>Baptists</hi> as well as us for wrangling and fighting in the dark, &amp;c.

               <p>But <hi>what Clamour? what Noise? what Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies? what Disorder? what Discord? what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion— your Vnchristian Carriage, &amp;c. p.</hi> 10.</p>

Oh partial Man! many hundreds can te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, that this Disorder, unchristian, yea, and uncivil Carriage, and frequent Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (to divert us from our Charge against <hi>T.

               <p>Touching the Complaint of <hi>our giving Occasion by a solemn Offer for Thousands of People to meet together and that to the Hazard of their Limbs and Lives, &amp;c.</hi> p. 10.

               <p>The Charge of <hi>Shuffling and Bogling at one single Question, being afraid,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 12. is unjust, and scornfully aggravated; for though there was some Intermission before an Answer was given, it was not at all out of any Fear, or to Shuffle about it, but because 1<hi>st,</hi> It was not W.

               <p>Where proves he these Words to be ours? Have we not plainly and often confest also, that <hi>the Divine, Nature or Word, cloathed with the most holy Manhood, and as having taken Flesh of the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>was and is the Christ</hi>?</p>
               <p>Yet we must own that if he was the <hi>Son of God</hi> before he took Flesh, <hi>he was Christ</hi> with respect to his Divine Nature, as proceeding from the Father; and that he was the Son of God before, is not denyed that we know of, in which Respect he was not seen with <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eyes,</hi> but with Respect to the Body which he took upon him in Time.</p>

               <p>Then how consistent with this is it to say, that the <hi>Human Nature (or Christ's Body of Flesh and Blood)</hi> is <hi>Christ</hi>? p. 17, 18.

               <p>Farther as to what we hold concerning the <hi>Christ of God,</hi> in Answer to his 20th Page.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Christ (who was the Word in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning) in due Time came in the Flesh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That though the meer Body of Jesus was not the entire Christ, yet the Name <hi>Christ,</hi> is sometimes given to the Body, though not so properly as to the whole Man Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That God was in Christ, and the Father and Son are inseparable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Distinction of Father and Son,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106644:13"/>
is not <hi>only nominal</hi> (as this Opposer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies against us) but real in the divine Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Father and Son, the Son as being the only-begotten of the Father, and also known as Co-Workers in the Order and Degrees of Manifestation and Discovery.</p>

               <p>Though these are none of our Words, yet this favours of meer Ignorance and Envy; we do not own any such Separation between God and Christ as these Words [<hi>The Christ of himself, and the God of himself</hi>] do imply, <hi>Socinian-like</hi>; but that the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father; as also that the Son is <hi>the mighty God, the everlasting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Prince of Peace</hi>; see how plain it is, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.6.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>That Christ is not a Person without us,</hi> p. 21. is not our Doctrine or Phrase that I know of or remember; only that the Title is thought too low and unscriptural, to give to the Christ of God, many Men having Gross Apprehensions about the Phrase [PERSON WITHOUT].

It's reported, <q>That their Books contain many Blasphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Almighty God, and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and withal, much Incredulity touching his only-begotten Son and First begotten of all Creatures, and the word Incarnate, and senseless Ignorance of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Euseb.</hi> lib. 7. fol. 125. ch. 5.

               </p>
               <p>Mark here, Though he grants Christ and the Word to be one and the same; yet this <hi>Argument</hi> denyes him to be either <hi>Christ,</hi> or the <hi>Word</hi> from the Beginning: What was he then? He tells us not. Doth not this oppose the <hi>Divinity of Christ,</hi> or <hi>Deity of the Son of God</hi>? to affirm, that <hi>He</hi> was neither <hi>as</hi> Christ, nor the Word from the Beginning; for, <hi>The Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> among much more of his idle <hi>Quibbling</hi> and Opposition, thus queries, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask thee, if Christ signifie Anointed, and God be Christ, as thou</hi> [Quaker] <hi>affirmest, Whether God himself e anointed</hi>? Dial. 3. pag. 32.</p>
               <p>Mark here who is the <hi>Quibbler</hi> irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently reflecting upon <hi>Scripture-Language,</hi> But unto the Son he saith, <hi>Thy Throne, O God! is for ever; a Scepter of Righteousness is the Scepter of thy Kingdom; Thou hast loved Righteousness and hated Iniquity; Therefore

God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the Oyl of Gladness above thy Fellows,</hi> Hebr. 1.8, 9. Psal. 45.6, 7.

Or that as the</hi> Son (<hi>who is</hi> God) <hi>he be anointed</hi> as <hi>he is the Son</hi>? And <hi>If</hi> He <hi>was the</hi> Son of God, <hi>and so</hi> Christ, <hi>before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation or assuming Flesh</hi>? However these men appear <hi>Socinianized</hi> now, and boggle at this Pre-Existence of <hi>Christ,</hi> and seem to define or limit him, only <hi>as a Person without us in Flesh</hi>; yet formerly some of their Brethren have confessed, <hi>That</hi> Christ <hi>is</hi> God, <hi>That</hi> Christ <hi>is call'd the</hi> Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17 yea, that <hi>The Father hath put his Name upon him,</hi> Exod. 23.21.

               <p>I pass by several Falshoods, traducing and canting Language in the said <hi>Qu. Quibbles</hi>; and grant that at length, that the <hi>Author</hi> hath shewn himself more ingenious then in all the Book besides, where he concludes thus, viz.

               <head>A Brief Introduction.</head>
               <p>THat these Men, who have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to answer our <hi>Appeal</hi> against <hi>Tho. Hicks,</hi> have pretended very fair in Words, is undeniable; but how they have performed and answered is already manifest, and will further appear in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Particulars, wherein I do complain against them both of their <hi>Injustice, Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and <hi>false Testimony,</hi> and affirm that they have neither approv'd themselves <hi>Just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> nor <hi>faithful Witnesses,</hi> in matters plain, and obvious (nor yet clear'd <hi>T. Hicks</hi>)</p>
               <p>In their <hi>Title-Page</hi> they say, <hi>Wherein the Allegations of</hi> William Penn <hi>in two Books lately published by him against</hi> T. Hicks, <hi>were answer'd and disproved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a manifest <hi>Vntruth</hi> as any Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Eye may see who is willing but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

this their <hi>Barbican</hi> Relation, styl'd <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>Appeal answered,</hi> with <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s two Books, the one entitul'd <hi>Reason against Railing,</hi> and the other, <hi>The Counterfit</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>detected</hi>; wherein many things are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and charged against <hi>T Hicks,</hi> both of <hi>vile Forgeries, black Slanders, gross Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, self-Contradictions, &amp;c.</hi> which are not so much as particulary mention'd, or touch'd in their said <hi>Relation</hi>; and some of those things they have medled with, were never so charg'd upon him, as under the Notion of <hi>vile Forgeries, &amp;c.</hi> nor in such things wherein he had truly cited our Words: We have not charg'd him for <hi>True Citations,</hi> nor for meer <hi>Mistakes</hi>; but, for plain <hi>Forgeries, Falshoods,</hi> and <hi>Slanders</hi> wilfully contrived by himself (about which, and not to judge of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>Appeal</hi> was made) as doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the two Books, and our late Charge exhibited agaist him, which we could never obtain a fair Tryal of <hi>T.

               <p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106644:26"/>
against him,</hi> viz. <hi>a FORGER and LYAR, we could do no less then desire</hi> T.H. <hi>to give us a Publick Meeting, that we might hear</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">when it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, they had heard that before the Meeting.</note> 
                  <hi>what he could say hereunto; and if he had done them</hi> ANY WRONG, <hi>either by Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoting of them in any of their Books, or Slandering of them in any thing he had charged them with, that we might, if any such thing appear'd, discharge that Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him as becomes us,</hi> viz. <hi>Either to bring him to acknowledge his Evil as publickly as he had wrong'd them; or to have disown'd him as a Person unworthy of Countenance among us, in case he should refuse so to do, it being altogether contrary to our Principle and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to allow any among us, that shall either in</hi> WORD <hi>or</hi> DEED <hi>wrong any sort of Men.</hi>

From all which it may be observ'd their fair Pretence in the first place, <hi>That if</hi> T.H. <hi>had done us any Wrong, either by</hi> Misquoting <hi>or</hi> Slandering <hi>us, their Duty had been cut her to bring him to acknowledge his Evil as publickly as he had wronged us, or to have disowned him, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>G.

Where nothing can well be clearer, then that G.

                  </q> See further <hi>Reas. against Rail.</hi> pag. 66, 67.</p>
               <p>And further let it be observed, wherein <hi>T. Hicks</hi> hath dealt Unfairly by G. F. in this matter [Though it be true that G. F. saith, <hi>That God breathed into Man the Breath of Life and he became a living Soul</hi>; and askt, <hi>Is not this which cometh out from God, of God, being without Beginning, Infinis in itself, &amp;c?</hi> Gr. Myst. <hi>fol.</hi> 29, 68, 90, 100.] But then <hi>T. Hicks</hi> having left out those Passages that chiefly explain G. F's Sense in this matter, takes it for granted, without Distinction,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106644:30"/>
that it is our Opinion, <hi>That the Soul is God</hi> (as he hath charg'd us) and this he hath made one main Reason for his accusing us with <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying all future &amp; distinct Beings or Rewards of Men after Death</hi> (which must procede either from his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,<note place="margin">Dial. 1. p. 62, 75.</note> or wilful <hi>Perversion</hi>) he taking G. F's Question about the <hi>Soul,</hi> to intend the meer <hi>Spirit</hi> of Man that God <hi>form'd</hi> in him, or the <hi>Soul,</hi> that is, <hi>a Reasonable Creature</hi>; which could not be intended in G. F's Question, which concerns that <hi>Immediate Breath,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Life,</hi> which came out from God, by which Man became a living Soul; wherein what is more evident then that G.F. doth not at all confound the <hi>Being of Man</hi> with the Being of <hi>his Maker</hi> [though <hi>God</hi> may be truly said to be the <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>Beings, the Life</hi> of <hi>Lives,</hi> &amp; so the <hi>Soul</hi> (or Life) <hi>of Souls,</hi> even of all Mankind] with respect unto this G. F's words appear very plain, where he saith, <hi>God breathed into Man the Breath of Life, and he became a living Soul; for that which came out from God, was the Cause that</hi> MAN <hi>became</hi> ALIVE, <hi>a living Soul; and is not this of God?</hi> Gr. Myst. <hi>pag.</hi> 68. See how plain and distinct these words are, between <hi>That</hi> which came out from God, and <hi>Man</hi> himself; and whether it was not an <hi>Abuse</hi> in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106644:31"/>
                  <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> to leave out those G.F's explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory words, which are in the very same Page that he quotes, and misconstrue his Question and Words to another Intention then they will bear; while G. F's words relating to that which came out from God, do not at all mention <hi>Man's Soul or Spirit,</hi> that I do or can find. Although <hi>T. H.</hi> and his Brethren take <hi>Soul</hi> (in G.F's Question) for the <hi>Spirit of Man,</hi> or <hi>the Reasonable Creature,</hi> so far as I can gather; as <hi>W. Kiffin</hi> and the rest do in their <hi>Epistle,</hi> entituled <hi>Heart-Bleedings for Professors, Abominations,</hi> and annext unto their <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> printed 1651. where they have these Phrases, viz. <hi>The Spirit which God formeth in Man; Our Spirit or Soul; a Creature; The reasonable Soul, &amp;c.</hi> Here they grant <hi>man's Spirit or Soul</hi> to be the same; whereas when <hi>G. F.</hi> speaks of the Soul in that sense, he hath this Phrase, <hi>The Soul being in Death, in Transgression, man's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit there is not sanctified,</hi> Gr. Myst. p. 91. These plain words <hi>T. H.</hi> also hath left out though in the very next page to what he quotes: What is more plain then that G.F. could not intend that <hi>Soul or Spirit</hi> of Man (which could be in Death, in Transgression) to be either <hi>God, his Divine Life, Being,</hi> or <hi>Part</hi> of God, but of Man only; for the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106644:31"/>
                  <hi>Being</hi> of God can never be either in Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, or Corrupted; because <hi>God is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible</hi>: And now from the Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that I have of G. F's words about the <hi>Soul,</hi> as in divers places of his said Book; He speaks of the <hi>Soul</hi> as under a two fold Consideration; 1st, with respect unto that <hi>Breath of Life,</hi> which God breathed into man, by which MAN became a <hi>living Soul,</hi> 2<hi>dly,</hi> with the respect to <hi>Man</hi> himself, as being thereby made a <hi>living Soul</hi>: And of <hi>Man,</hi> as under a three fold Consideration; 1. As Man was in the Beginning (before the Fall) being made <hi>Alive,</hi> a <hi>Living Soul,</hi> by the <hi>Breath</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> of God. 2. To Man faln, and in the Fall, from God; wherein his Soul or Spirit is brought under Death in Sin and Transgression, and so is polluted with Sin while Unsanctified. 3. To Man as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, and his Soul quickned to God again by the Spirit of Life, and so saved by and in <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> who is the <hi>Bishop of the Soul.</hi> This I do understand and plainly gather from the Tenour of G. F's Words and Answers.</p>
               <p>But sith <hi>Thomas Hicks</hi>'s Charge against the <hi>Quakers</hi> was, that <hi>they are No Christians,</hi> and that one of his principal Allegations for Proof is, that their Opinion is, That <hi>the Soul is God, or part of God, and of God's Being with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106644:32"/>
Beginning and Infinite,</hi> which perversly and darkly he hath drawn from G.F's meer Question (as plainly appears before) we had need to look the more strictly into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Upon which I ask, If to put this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion [<hi>Is not THAT of God, and of his Being, which came out from God, by which Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a living Soul</hi>?] be an Opinion suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prove Us <hi>No Christians</hi>? Then, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no they are</hi> Christians, <hi>who say, that</hi> the Soul of Man is a Spirit of the NATURE of God, which returns to God that gave it? <hi>And whether this be not as high an Assertion of the</hi> Soul <hi>of Man, as can be supposed</hi> G. F. <hi>ever asserted</hi>? And that some <hi>Baptists</hi> have thus asserted of the <hi>Soul,</hi> see what they say in their own Instances and Words, viz. <hi>That this is a known Truth, that every thing at its Dissolution dissolveth into its first Principles:</hi>

               <p>And again, T. H. addeth, <hi>This Question was put meerly to slander him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A notorious Untruth! It was not put with any such Intent as meerly <hi>to slander him</hi>; for it is true that such a Report was given to me of him, and seem'd not improbable, or then incredible to me, such <hi>Recreations</hi> (so call'd) being common to men of his Coat. It is true that by the <hi>Question</hi> before, I did oppose a <hi>Gamster</hi> or <hi>Player at Bowls,</hi> to a Minister of the Gospel; but that I neither made the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> nor design'd <hi>to slander T.D.</hi> by way of Question, or otherwise, as I am <hi>slanderously</hi> accused, see the following <hi>Certificate</hi>:</p>

Hicks</hi>'s Charge against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as before; but sufficient to shew his great <hi>Malice</hi> &amp; <hi>False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>; and these Coverings will not hide him: It is his own Sin, to insinuate by way of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, to <hi>slander us</hi>; for thus he hath done by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106644:41"/>
us and our Sufferings, witness his base and Deceitful Questions, insinuating, that the <hi>Satisfaction of our Wills and Lusts, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting our Carnal Interests, is, or may be our chief Motive or Inducement, to suffer as we use to do,</hi> Dial. 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 75.</p>
               <p>This he hath made no Scruple to insinuate by Way of Question against us, and yet maketh it a great <hi>Crime,</hi> to ask a Question that seem'd probable about <hi>a Report of a</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Priest's <hi>Playing at Bowls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And be it noted also, that for a further Proof of his Charge against us, he brings this Instance, <hi>pag.</hi> 24. viz. <hi>If any Persons write or speak their Grief that the publick take notice of it, they will represent them under such Terms as may render them Odious; and the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to weaken their Testimonies, they will fix upon them scurrilous and contemptible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations, and to prevent any Inquisition into the Truth of the Matter they would make Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe that they are Envious, Malicious, Dirty, Factious and Ranting Spirits.</hi> And for these general <hi>Accusations</hi> (which we may say, are very <hi>Abusive</hi> and <hi>False</hi>) he quotes <hi>Spir. of the Hat,</hi> pag. 36, 37. which is so far from being any <hi>of our Books,</hi> or any one's <hi>Eminent among us,</hi> that it was an Envious <hi>Apostate's,</hi> a <hi>Libellous Pamphlet,</hi> yet promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106644:41"/>
and spread by some <hi>Baptists</hi> against us, who are beholding to <hi>Apostates</hi> and <hi>Back-sliders</hi> for their Engines to work against the People of God call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their Integrity in the Truth; But the said <hi>Lying Pamphlet</hi> styl'd <hi>The Spirit of the Hat,</hi> was plainly opposed and seriously an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd by our Friends in their Book, entitul'd <hi>The Spirit of</hi> Alexander <hi>the Coppersmith, &amp;c.</hi> yet these <hi>Baptists</hi> in their <hi>Preface,</hi> would make the World believe, <hi>That the Books</hi> (<hi>produced and cited by</hi> T.

Now you that have concern'd your selves for <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> Do you think to acquit him from <hi>Forgery</hi> by such Proceding? Have you approv'd your selves either <hi>Just</hi> or <hi>Impartial Men,</hi> to admit of our Adversary's <hi>Accusations</hi> for <hi>Proof,</hi> to Clear your Brother <hi>T.

No, No; Such Work will neither clear you nor him, while <hi>Justice and Truth is faln in your Streets,</hi> and you have <hi>not suffer'd Equity to enter</hi>: You are <hi>Witnesses</hi> on behalf of a <hi>Forger,</hi> and your <hi>Confederacy</hi> therein is Impious, and <hi>God will break it and bring you to Judgment.</hi>

For Proof of this he again citeth that lying Pamphlet, <hi>Spir. of Hat,</hi> in these Words; <hi>What meaneth</hi> (saith he of the <hi>Quakers</hi>) <hi>that certain Persons are appointed to spend the whole Time in speaking in every Meeting, and all the rest to come as Hearers, neglecting the Gift in themselves, only waiting upon their Lips,</hi> Spirit of the Hat, p. 29.</p>
               <p>Which is also as arrant a Falshood as his Charge before; for 1<hi>st,</hi> we do not so appoint our Ministers or certain Persons before hand to speak in such a Place and Time, or to spend the whole Time in speaking. 2<hi>dly,</hi> Neither do the rest of the Hearers neglect their Gift, or only wait upon their Lips, but upon the Lord, and all are referred to the Guidance of God's free Spirit in themselves,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106644:42"/>
having a free Liberty therein to improve and make Use of their Gifts, as God shall call, there being both Gospel Liberty and Order among us, and <hi>the Spirit of the Prophets subject to the Prophets</hi>; and Gospel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters have Unity in the Spirit, and with one anothers Testimony, which is not of Man, nor by the Will of Man: However, these <hi>Baptists</hi> seek to clear their Brother by such false Stories as before, scraped out of an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state</hi> and Enemies Pamphlet.</p>
               <p>Another Charge, falsly insinuating, <hi>That we do not really or fully own the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> is this, viz. <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>own the Scripture as far as it agrees to the Light in them:</hi> And for Proof of this <hi>T.

               </p>
               <p>Whereas this is a Proof, that we fully own the Scriptures without any such Exception or Reservation, as is implyed in the Charge before; for it is apparent, that we fully own the <hi>Light</hi> within to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> and therefore the Scriptures which came from it to be really true: However, the <hi>Dialogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> would be accounted a very exact Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Consequences, even such an one as would <hi>not abate a Word</hi> of his <hi>Dialogues,</hi> but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106644:43"/>
would have them be believed as <hi>Real</hi> Truths, though they be <hi>no Real Discourses,</hi> as he hath since confessed, in Answer to <hi>T. R</hi>'s Objection, That the <hi>Dialogue</hi> is presented to the World, as a <hi>Real Discourse</hi>; to which he answers, <hi>I do assure him it was not so understood or intended by me in the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it</hi> (he should then have told the World so) but then he adds, <hi>though it be as True and Real, as though it had been a Verbal Discourse</hi>; whenas much of his <hi>Dialogues</hi> is made up of <hi>Consequences</hi> of his own framing, yet he hath sought to make the World believe, that the Answers given are <hi>no other then what the</hi> Quakers <hi>give</hi>; and that the Matters he had objected were <hi>Real Truths and no Factions</hi>: But doth not his Charge and Consequence before imply such Untruth as this his unjust Charge, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>undervalue or slight the Holy Scriptures, or account them of no more Authority then</hi> Esop'<hi>s Fables</hi>? And that all this follows from their asserting <hi>the Scriptures to be given forth from the Light within, which they so highly esteem of and own to be Infallible</hi>?

               <p>To which he gives this Answer in the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Name, viz. <hi>I say tho Plagues and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God will follow thee</hi> [and to this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth] <hi>George Whitehead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>T. Hicks</hi>'s Abuse and Falshood herein was detected in <hi>W. P's</hi> Answer to his last Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue, <hi>Counterf. Christian,</hi> pag. 19, 20, 21. As also his <hi>Forgery</hi> herein laid upon him in my <hi>Appendix</hi> to <hi>Reason ag. Railing,</hi> p. 13. Howbeit, he is not ashamed in the <hi>Barbican Relation</hi> to say, <hi>The Truth of this Answer see attested under Mr</hi> John Gladman'<hi>s hand,</hi> Dial. 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 85.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:106644:44"/>
I do not think that <hi>T. Hicks</hi> can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his wittingly wronging both me and <hi>John Gladman</hi> in this case; for observe, doth <hi>Jo. Gladman</hi> in the place quoted attest, that this was <hi>G. W's Answer to the Question to which it is annexed by T. H. in G.W's Name</hi>? No. But that G.W. <hi>spoak the Words in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with him,</hi> that is, with <hi>John Gladman</hi>; Not to T. H. in Answer to his Question: If <hi>J. Gladman</hi> speak his Conscience, he dare not attest that this was <hi>G. W's Answer</hi> to this Question to which it is here adjoyned as <hi>his Answer</hi> or <hi>saying thereunto</hi>; Therefore T.H. <hi>is a Forger,</hi> and hath cheated his <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and drawn in <hi>J. Gladman</hi> for a <hi>Cover to his Deceit</hi>; which shews his Spirit and Work to be in the Dark, like that of an <hi>Impostor</hi> and <hi>Jugler</hi> in these matters; And <hi>Men fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God,</hi> would be ashamed either to be his <hi>Witnesses,</hi> or to countenance, or encourage him therein. Although I deny not, that I spake any such Words against T. H. at any time, as J. G. hath unfairly represented me, in telling the World, <hi>That G. W. denyeth he said so</hi> (against <hi>T. Hicks</hi>) Dial. 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 85. for my Answer shows the contrary in my said <hi>Appendix,</hi> p. 13. though still I deny that to be my Answer unto <hi>T.H's</hi> Question before; however, as I did not question (as in my <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix</hi>)
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106644:44"/>
but that <hi>the Judgments of God would follow</hi> T. Hicks <hi>for his Forgeries &amp; Slanders</hi>; so I am of the same mind still, and my so speaking I neither did give, nor do give for an Answer to his particular Questions: But in his fictitiously placing it, as my saying to that one Question before, he might as well have made it serve to every Question in all his <hi>Dialogues,</hi> which was never so intended nor spoaken by me; but with reference to his <hi>Forgeries and Slanders</hi> in general.</p>
