            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE very Title to these Ensuing Sheets seems so clearly to express the
Author's Design in them that Use alone, rather than any Necessity,
seems to extort this from him: For though the Instruction of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<hi>Protestant Christian</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> was greatly the Author's scope
and intent, yet the terrible Impressions left in the Two last Reigns, even upon all
Degrees and Qualities, remain yet so fresh and lively, that any one that would take
the pains to read Three or Four<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the First Pages, would readily believe any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planatory
Preamble; needless 'tis therefore to satisfie the Nicety or Prejudice, that
some Persons may conceive, from the Author's too boldly, and too publickly intruding
into the Cabinets of Princes, that this small Apology is prefixt: In order to this, the
Author Solemnly here Declares, That the Lashing and Exploding the Crimes and
Villanies publickly, and most under a seeming Form of Law and Justice, committed
in the Two late Reigns, rather then exposing any particular Persons, was his chief
Aim and Design; and that since, Works of this Nature, could not be done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the using some Fictitious Names of Persons, whereon to fix his Characters, He
thinks He may justly decline, any Blame ensuing thereupon, since they alone can
justy pretend to be affronted, whose Consciences too clearly convince them of the
Truth of these Relations: The Truth I say, which by the Authentick Testimony, as
well as Experience of many Grave Persons, has often, already, though
in another Method, been asserted and exprest: And although in one thing especially,
<hi>viz.</hi> in his representing the King Poysoned, He will not be so Obstinate, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
he hath Demonstration for it, yet the common Fame of it remaining amongst us,
almost without Contradiction, even to this very Day, may in some measure be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused,
as the Foundation of a very plausible Argument, in a Work especially of
this kind: Another Observation is too Obvious to him; Why a Person of so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polite
a Stile, and perhaps not truly verst in a regular Connection of Things, would
venture upon a Work which ought to have been left to the Elaborate Pens of some
more Experienc'd Author. To this he Answers, That being to play the Historian,
rather than the Orator, to Instruct with Truth, rather than to Amuse with Flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes;
to vndeceive the Commonalty (so often led aside by the crafty Insinuations of
the Witty) and to bring in Parallel the happy State of <hi>Hungary,</hi> under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Government; with its deplorable Condition under the Two last Reigns, he
thought this stile and manner more suitable to his Designs, and their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages;
desiring them to read with an Impartial Judgment, the following Sheets;
and promising to submit to the acknowledgment of any Errors, such a Judgment
shall at any time Convict and Consute him.</p>

                     <p>Why, a'nt please your Highness, I prove in thus: <hi>None
but Madmen and Fools hang themselves; but</hi> Demophilus <hi>was a
Madman and a Fool, therefore he hang'd himself.</hi> Ha—ha—ha,
there's an Argument off-hand egad, I'le have it in my next <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servator</hi>
egad, and you shall see how the grave Citts will hammer
upon it: This is only to shew your Highness how an ingenious
Man may baffle this dull <hi>plodding World</hi> egad: But the plain truth
on't is, I do hear it whisper'd about that he has made away with
himself, but as yet I know no particulars.</p>

                     <p>Pish, pish, 'tis as plain as the Sun, and the Reason for
it prevent all dispute; for either <hi>there was a Plot, or there was not:</hi>
If there was a Plot, he was afraid the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> would have
brought him in for a Snack for not discovering it sooner; and let
me tell you, a man had as good be half hang'd as be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a <hi>House of Commons; ergo,</hi> He was afraid, and so forth. And
if there was no plot, as to be sure there is not, why then, mark
you me, there's <hi>Scandalium Magnatum,</hi> and a hundred other
Plagues, that let me be hang'd, I think he took the best way to
remove himself by a <hi>Habeas Corpus;</hi> and if this be not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
I'le be bound to write Ballads as long as I live; and
there's somthing for <hi>Observator</hi> again.</p>

                     <p>Nay, let me be hang'd, an't please your Highness, but
you have hit upon my way to an <hi>hairs</hi> breadth; for when there is
any Matter of Consequence likely to be disputed, then <hi>what do
me I,</hi> mark you me, but espouse the <hi>Court Curse</hi> to be sure, <hi>right
or wrong;</hi> and then do I, in a bantering sort of way, insinuate and
introduce all the Arguments that the other side can possibly be
suppos'd to bring, and by <hi>ridiculing</hi> some, and <hi>waving</hi> the rest,
egad I leave them bustling and scratching their Heads to find out
new Matter; for efack, if they come once to Repetition, whip I
slave 'em like School-boys; so that egad in <hi>Conclusion</hi> I'le prove
that this Sir <hi>Demophilus</hi> feloniously laid <hi>violent hands</hi> upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himself,

were made of the <hi>same Flesh and Blood</hi> as other People; that they
were subject to the same Infirmities as other Men; that Lusts, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and Vices, were sometimes predominant in them, as in others;
and consequently when any of them were so given over to all sorts
of Licentiousness and bloody Tyranny, as to neglect the great End
for which they were set over their People; and instead of protecting
them in their Laws, Liberties, Religion, and Lives, they would
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93485:28"/>
endeavour wholly to subvert and destroy them; that then it was
lawful for such a People to take such proper means as might restrain;
and if that would not do, to resist, and obtain that by force, which
he would not in Justice grant: And all this as his private general
Opinion of the Case, without the least Reflection on the King or
his Government.</p>

                     <p>True; what care I if the Sanhedrim don't sit these seven
years. A murrain on 'em, they never come together but it costs
me as much Money as would maintain my Family a Month: Beside,

without Taxes as well as any of you; but I fear we shall pay for it
one day; as they say, the King is not made of Money, nor is he so
very thrifty of that little he has, but that he must want in a little time;
