            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For then should they be free from much prejudice, and find better acceptance with those that they come to.

I doe not abuse good words, or load one with thhem whom they do not belong to, as many p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Neither is this all that the Authours quality may suggest unto the considerate Reader: but he may arise from this to more important thoughts; especially if the remembrance of M.

<pb facs="tcp:50465:3"/>
the reason should be what such famous men of God, could never like wel of our Bishoply courses in England, nor ever be favoured of them. The case is plaine to all: and the cause is as evident to those that have eyes to see: but no where more apparant then in the person of M. Baines, and the place where he, and other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> like him were made signes of this antipathie. Cambridge is or should be, as an eye to all our land: so that the alterations that fall out there cannot but be felt of all parts. It is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When M. Perkins had there for many yeares held forth a burning and shining light, the sparks wherof did flie abroad into all corners of the land, and after he had served his time was taken up into heaven, there was none found so meet for to receive, as it were, the torch out of his hand, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in that great office of bearing it before such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as this M. Bains, upon whom also the spirit of that Elias, was by experience found to be doubled. In this station he so demeaned himself for some years, that impietie only had cause to complaine: for all that favoured the waies of God, rejoyced and gloried in him and his Minist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry, asa spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all treasure. But at length the hower of darknes came from Lambeth, when Arch. Bancroft sent M. Harsenet to Visite as they call it, that is (if termes may be interpreted by common practise) to pick the purses of poore men, and to suppr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iends to the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shops King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For though in that circuit there were a multitude of unable and notoriously scandalous Ministers, yet none were fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d worthy of censure, but only M. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, of whom the world was not worthy, and one other Preacher like unto him. Now it is hard to say, whether the silencing of him was more odious, or the manner of it shameles. There must be a Sermon (ye know) at such Visitations, for fashion sake, though the Visiter himself can seldom find leasure to make it. This part was therfore appointed to M. Bains by
<pb facs="tcp:50465:3"/>
the Visiters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he might either be insnared in his words, if he did not apply himself to their humours, or else grace their ungratious courses, if he did. But it did not succeed handsomly either way: For he delivered wholesome doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine appertaining to the present audience, in such warie manner, that no specious occasion could be taken therby of questioning his liberty. Yet fairely or fouly the mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous intention must not faile. M. Baines having heat his weak body by straining to speak unto a great audience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired himselfe presently upon his comming down from the Pulpit to provide for his health, which otherwise would have bin indangered. They in the mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time going on with their businesse, as they are wont in the masterly forme of a master, called for M. Baines amongst the rest, and upon his not answering, though he was not cited thither as to a Court, but only intreated to preach, as he did, yet for not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, he was immediately silenced. Afterward in deed, the Chancellor being informed of that grosse nullity, which was in the sentence, urged him about subscription and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; and so to make sure work, silenced him over again. In which businesse he was so conscious unto himself of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable and ridiculous dealing, that when M. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s standing to receive the sentence of a corrupt man, did lift up his heart and eies unto God with a heavenly smiling countenance, as he used, he interpreted that gesture to be a skorne of his authority. This being don, M. Baines was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by his friends to try the Archbishops courtesie, unto whom, when he presented himself, at the very first sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation; the gravity and severity of B. Bancroft led him sharply to rebuke the good man for a little black-worke, which was upon the edges of his cuffes, asking him how he durst come before him with such cuffs, telling him very bishoplike, that it were a good turn to lay him by the heels for so doing. After this he would have no more to do with such absurd unreasonable men: but preached somtime wher he might have liberty, as his weakenesse of body would suffer; and spent the rest of his time in reading, meditating, praying and writing, saving that upon occasion hee did
<pb facs="tcp:50465:4"/>
instruct or comfort those which came to him in private, wherin he had a heavenly gift. He was indeed all his life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, beside the weakenes of his body pressed with want, no having (as he often complained to his friends) a place to rest his head in: which me thought was an upbraid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng of the age and place where he lived with base regardlesnes of piety &amp; learning: yet he never so much as consulted with himselfe of denying his sinceritie by pleasing the Bishops, of whom and their courses he was wont to say, <hi>They are a generation of the earth, earthly and savour not the waies of God.</hi> Which saying of his, they, and some Doctors of Cambridge have since made good, in that they could not indure, that the place from whence they thrust him, should be supplied by oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r honest men, though they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable, but with absolute authority at length forbad it, alledging that Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes were made by that lecture: wheras the truth is, that one lecture hath done more good to the Church of God in England, then all the doctors of Cambridge: though I doe not deny, but some of them have wrought a good work.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:50465:4"/>
of those Ministers which they have silenced for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity then in all the Bishops families that are now in England? Was there ever any of them that could endure such a Parish as Lambeth is, if they had such power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it as the Archbishops haue?</p>
            <p>To returne therfore unto our Authour: whilst he lived a private life, being thus strucken with the Bishops Planet, he had time to apply his able wit and judgement unto the discussing of many questions, which if the Prelates had not forced such leasure upon him, it may be he would have passed by with others. And among the rest, by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence he was directed to these Ecclesiastical Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies which concerne our Diocesan state in England: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as in all other questions which he dealt in, he hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such distinct and piercing understanding together with evidence of truth, as cannot but give good satisfaction to him that in these things seeketh light.</p>
            <p>He might indeed have chosen other particular corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to have written on, if it had bene his purpose either to have taught men, what they daily see and feel, or to have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured about the branches, and leave the root untouched: But it was no delight unto him, for to prove that which no man doubted of, as that the common course and practise of our Prelates, their courts, their urging of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bscriptions, with human superstitious ceremonies, are presumptuous insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies against God and his Church: or preposterously to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne at the end of the streame for to cleanse the water. He chose rather to search the fountain of all that foulnes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ions here in this Treatise examined. And if these few questions be wel considered, it will appear that a multitude of pernitious abuses doe depend on those positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which in them are confuted. One fundamentall abuse in our Ecclesiasticall oppression in the disposing of charges, our placing of Ministers over Congregations: it is called u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually bestowing of Be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>efices or Livings, in an earthy phrase which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avoureth of the base corruption commonly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. For Congregations ought not to be bestowed on Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
<pb facs="tcp:50465:5"/>
but Ministers on Congregations: the benefit or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice of the Minister, is not so much to be regarded, as of the Congregation: It is the calling and charge which every Minister should looke at, not his living and benefice. Now these Benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es are bestowed ordinarily by the Patro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popish, prophane, or religious, all is one) &amp; the Bishop, without any regard of the peoples call or consent: so as no lawful mariage is made; no servant placed: against all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Councels and antient examples. Wherby it commeth ordinarily to passe, that Lawyers must determine of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters callings, after long sutes and great charges; as if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and Farms were held by one title and right. And sometime it is found that the Minister is a continuall plague unto his people, living in contention, spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e &amp; hatred with them, as many law-suits do too too plainly witnes. What is the reason? Because Parishes are esteemed as no Churches that ever were ordained by Christ, or received any power and priviledges from him, but as mans creatures, and by man to be ordered as it pleaseth him. Another practice of like nature with the former, is that the minister being called to one Congregation, becommeth a Pluralist by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or more livings, in spite of that Congregation, to which he was first and is still personally tied. And after this he may be a nonresident, abiding or Preaching at none of his many livings. Nay he may chop and change, sell and buy like a marchant, so he do it closely; which is such an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as Rome and Trent condemneth, and hell it selfe will scarse defend. What is the ground? Because (forsooth) Christ hath not appointed Parishes, their office<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s &amp; offices, and therfore no man is bound further in this kinde, then mens Laws, canons, customes, and injunctions do prescribe unto them. For a grave Doctor of Cambridge answered one that questioned him for his grosse non-residencie, <hi>viz.</hi> that Parishes were divided by a Pope: insinuating as it seemeth, that he accounted it a point of Poperie, for to tie Ministers unto their particular charges.</p>
            <p>A third grosse corruption is, that the officers in Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Ministers, Church-wardens, &amp;c. are made servants to
<pb facs="tcp:50465:5"/>
the Bishops, Chancellours, Archdeacons, &amp;c. being, as it were, their promotors, informers, and executioners, in all matters of jurisdiction and government, for to bring in mony into their purses: for performance also of which service to them, the Church-wardens upon every occasion are enforced to take such corporall oathes as not one of them doth ever keep. What other ground of this, beside the fore-mentioned, that particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are no spirituall incorporations, and therefore must have no officers for government within themselves?</p>
            <p>Now all these confusions with many others of the same kind, how they are condemned in the very foundation of them, M. Bains here sheweth in the first question, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the divine constitution of a particular Church, in one Congregation. In which question he maintaineth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his adversaries a course not unlike to that which Armachanus, in the daies of King Edward the third, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for against the begging F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iers in his booke called <hi>The defence of Curates</hi>: For when those Friers incroach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d upon the priviledges of Parochiall Ministers, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood them upon these grounds: <hi>Ecclesia Parochialis jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta verba Mosis Deut.</hi> 12. <hi>est locus electus a Deo, in quo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus accipere cuncta quae praecipit Dominus ex Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis. Parochus est ordinaritu Parochiani: est persona a Deo praecepta, vel mandato Dei ad illud ministerium ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plendum electa:</hi> which if they be granted, our adversaries cause may goe a begging with the foresaid Friers.</p>
            <p>Another sort of corruptions there are, which though they depend upon the same ground with the former, yet immediately flow out of the Hierarchie. What is more dissonant from the revealed will of Christ in the Gospell, even also from the state of the Primitive Church, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en that the Church and Kingdome of Christ should be managed as the Kingdomes of the world, by a Lordly authority, with externall pompe, commanding power, contentious courts of judg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ment, furnished with chancellors, officials, commissaries, advocates, proctors, paritors, and such like humane devices? Yet all this doth necessarily follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:50465:6"/>
the admitting of such Bishops as ours are in England: who not onely are Lords over the flock, but doe professe so much in the highest degree, when they tell us plainly, that their Lawes or Canons doe binde mens consciences. For herein we are like the people of Israel, who would not have God for their immediate King, but would have such Kings as other Nations: Even so the Papists, and we after them, refuse to have Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an immediate King in the immediate government of the Church; but must have Lordly Rulers with state in Ecclesiasticall affaires, such as the world hath in civill.</p>
            <p>What a miserable pickle are the most of our Ministers in, when they are urged to give an account of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? To a Papist indeed they can give a shifting answer, that they have ordination from Bishops, which Bishops were ordained by other Bishops, and they, or their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers by Popish Bishops: this in part may stop the mouth of a Papish: but let a Protestant which doubteth of these matters move the question, and what then will they say? If they flie to popish Bishops, as they are popish, then let them goe no longer masked under the name of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants. If they alledge succession by them from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, then (to say nothing of the appropriating of this succession unto the Popes chaire, in whose name, and by whose authority o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r English Bishops did all things in times past) then I say they must take a great time for the satisfying of a poore man concerning this question, and for the justifying of their station. For untill that out of good records they can shew a perpetuall succession from the Apostles unto their Diocesan which ordained them, and untill they can make the poore man which doubteth, perceive the truth and certainty of those records, (which I wiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they will doe at leasure) they can never make that succession appeare. If they flye to the Kings authority, the King himse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe will forsake them, and deny that he taketh upon him to make or call Ministers. If to the present Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Archbishops, alas they are as farre to seeke as themselves, and much further. The proper cause of all this
<pb facs="tcp:50465:6"/>
misery is the lifting up of a lordly Prelacy, upon the ruines of the Churches liberties.</p>
            <p>How intollerable a bondage is it, that a Minister being called to a charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may not preach to his people except he hath a licence from the Bishop or Archbishop: Cannot receive the best of his Congregation to communion if he be censured in the spirituall Courts, though it be but for not paying of six pence which they required of him in any name, be the man otherwise never so innocent: nor keep one from the communion, that is not presented in those Courts, or being presented is for money absolved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he be never so scandalous: and must often times (if hee will hold his place) against his conscience put backe those from communion with Christ, whom Christ doth call unto it (as good Christians if they will not kneele) and receive those that Christ putteth backe, at the command of a mortall man.</p>
            <p>What a burthen are poore Ministers pressed with, in that many hundreds of them depend upon one Bishop and his Officers: they must hurry up to the spirituall Court upon every occasion, there to stand with cap in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd, not onely before a Bishop, but before his Chancellour, to bee railed on many times at his pleasure: to be censured, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, deprived, for not observing some of those canons which were of purpose framed for snares, when far more ancient and honest canons are every day broken by these Iudges themselves for lucre sake, as in the making of Vto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian Ministers, who have no people to minister unto; in their holding of commendams, in their taking of money, even to extortion, for orders and institutions: in their sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as well by giving as by taking: and in all their idle, covetous, and ambitious pompe? For all these and such like abuses, we are beholding to the Lordlinesse of our Hierarchy: which in the root of it, is here overthrown by M. Bayne, in the conclusions of the second and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:50465:7"/>
For he in his booke called <hi>Defensor pacis,</hi> layeth the same grounds that here are maintained. Some of his words, though they be large, I will here set downe for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders information. <hi>Potestas clavium sive solvendi &amp; ligan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, est essentialis &amp; inseparabilis Presbyterio in quantum Presbyter est. In hac authoritate, Episcopus à Sacerdote non differt, teste Hieronymo, imo verius Apostolo, cujus etiam est aperta sententia.

It were too long to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ite all. Yet one thing is worthy to be observed how he interpreteth a phrase of Ierome so much alledged, and built upon by the Patrons of our Hierarchy. Ierome saith ad Evagr. that a Bishop doth nothing, excepting ordinati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n, which a Presbyter may not doe. Of this testimony D. Downan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voucheth, that nothing can be more pregnant then it, to prove that Bishops were superiour to Presbyters in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ordination. But heare what this ancient Writer saith <hi>Ordinatio non significat ibi potestatem conferendi, ceu collationem sacrorum ordinum: sed oeconomicam potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem regulandi vel dirigendi Ecclesiae ritus, atque personas, quantum ad exercitium divini cultus in templo; unde ab antiquis legumlatoribus vocantur Oeconomi reverendi.</hi>

               </gap>y then, though many Synagogues, yet because they were all but one Kingdome, and had all but one profession, were all one nationall church. Ergo, upon like grounds many church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s with us, in a nation or city, may be one nationall or Diocesan church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the church of Jerusalem in the New Testament is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. 1 That which the Apostles intended should be a head church to all Christians in Judea, that was a Diocesan church. But this they did by the church of Jerusalem. Ergo: 2. That which was more numbersome, then could meet Parishion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lly, was no Parishional but Diocesan church. But that church was such. First, by growing to 3000. then 5000 Act. 2.41. &amp; 4.4. then to have millions in it, Act. 21.20. Ergo, the church of Jerusalem was not a Parishionall, but a Dioc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>san church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the church of Corinth is objected to have beene a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan church. He who writing to the church of Corinth, doth write to all the Saints in Achaia with it, doth imply that they were all subordinate to that church. But th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s doth Paul, 1 Cor. 2.1. Ergo. Secondly He who saluteth jointly the Corinthians and Achaians, and calleth the church of Corinth by the name of Achaia, and names it with pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the church of Corinth was the Metropolitan church to which all Acha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>a was subject. But the Apostle doth this, 2 Cor. 9.2. &amp; 11.11.8.9.10. Ergo.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that which was the mother city of all Macedonia, the church in that city must be, if not a Metropolitan, yet a Diocesan church. But Philippi was so. Ergo.</p>
            <p>The fifth is from the chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

But Christ in his Epiphonema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall conclusion to every church, which he had spoken to in singular, doth speake of the same as of a multitude. <hi>Let him that hath eares, beare what the Spirit saith to the Churches.</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p>Thus leaving sacred examples, we come to Ecclesiasticall.</p>
            <p>First, in regard of those ancien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> churches, Rome, Alexandria. It is impossible they should bee a Parishionall congregation 200. yeares after Christ. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f the multitude of christians did in Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem so increase within a little time, that they exceeded the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of one congregation, how much more likely is it that chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in Rome and Alexandria did so increase in 200. yeares, that they could not keep in one particular Assembly? But the first is true. Ergo, also the latter. Which is yet further co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>firmed by that which Tertullian and Cornelius testifie of their times.</p>
            <p>To come from these to our moderne reformed church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, these prove a Diocesan church. That respect which many congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons distinct may have now assembled in one place, that they may have severed in many places. For the unity of the place is but extrinsicke to the unity of the congreg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> congregations gathered in one city, may make, wee say, one church, as they doe in the Netherlands. Ergo, distinct congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, severed in divers places may make one church. If many churches, which may subject themselves to the government of one Presbytery, may so make one, they may subject themselves to a bishop and cathedrall consistory, and so make one. But the 24. churches of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the territories belonging to it, doe subject themselves to the government of one Presbytery, and so make one. For so farre as two meete in a th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rd, they are one in it. Ergo.</p>
            <p>The third principall Argument is from reason. If city chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches onely, and not the churches of Villages, and coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50465:9"/>
Presbyters planted by the Apostles were so. Ergo. They who were set in a church before Parishes were, could not be given to a Parishionall church. But such were the Presbyters of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s institution, Ergo. For it is plaine in the practice of all ages, from the first division, that no church but the mother church had a Presbytery and a bishop, but Presbyters onely. Nay, it was ever by councels condemned, and by the judgement of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent forbidden, that in Townes or Villages, any but a Presbyter should be planted. 3. This is also proved by reason, for it was no more possible to have bishops and Presbyters in every Parish, then to have a Maior and Aldermen (such as we have in London) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n every Towne. 2. If every Parish had a Presbyter, then had they power of ordination, and furnishing themselves with a Minister, when now they were destitute. But they were alwaies in this case dependant on the city. Ergo, there was then a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ocesan church having government of others. Presbyters could not ordaine, <hi>sede vacante,</hi> though th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now we must muster those forces which oppose these Diocesan churches, allowing onely such churches to bee instituted of Christ, which may meet in one congregation ordinarily.</p>

they are said to be millions of beleevers, yet that was by accident of a circumstance, happily the Passeover. We must not judge the greatnesse of a water by that it is, when now it is up and swelleth by accident of some inundations.

            <p>Fourthly, the Church of Ephesus was but one flocke. First, it is likely that it was of no other forme then the other. Secondly, it was but one flocke; that flocke which Presbyters might jointly feed, was but one. They had no Diocesan B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>shop. If Presbyters onely, then none but Parishionall Churches in and about Ephesus. There may be many flocks, but God ordained none, but such as may wholly meet with those, who have the care of feeding and governing of them. <hi>Peter</hi> indeed, 1 Pet. 5.2. calleth all those he writeth to, one flocke: but that is in regard either of the mysticall estate of the faithfull, or in respect of the common nature which is in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches one and the same: but properly, and in externall adunation, one flocke is but one congregation. Thirdly, Parishes according to the adverse opinion, were not then divided. Neither doth the long and fruitfull labours of the Apostles argue, that there should be Parish Churches in Diocesan wise added; but a greater number of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>First, the efficient cause, God ordeyning. For none can take on him to be a minister <hi>Diocesan:</hi> no place to be a place, where the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly Diocesan should be held; no people can worship God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to this place and ministery, without warrant of his word. <hi>Ergo.</hi> In the Nationall church of the Jewes, <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes tooke not that honour, it was given them: The place of the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall meeting, God chose Hierusalem. The people he precisely bound to practise some ordinances of worship no where but there, and to appeare there before him. Secondly, the matter of a Diocesan church is people within such a circuit, obliged to meet at least on solemne dayes, wheresoever the Diocesan Ministers and Ordinances of worship are exercised; Pastors who have callings to tend them and minister to them in this Diocesan meeting now assembled. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the actuall meeting of them to such, end, as such more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and publike meetings are ordained to, are no where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50465:11"/>
nor in any fashion were ever by any warrant of the Word pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised.</p>
            <p>If any say, these are not the causes of a Diocesan Church, but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God binding persons within such a circuit to subject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to such a Church and the ministery thereof, that they may be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by them.</p>
            <p>I answer. First, there is no ordinance of God for this, that can be shewed, that Churches within such a circuit should be tyed to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine head Church for government. Nay, it is false. For every Church by Christs institution hath power of government; and the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue had in ordinary matters, the government that the Church of Jerusalem had; (being all over) except onely in some reserved causes. Secondly, I say, that this will not make a Diocesan Church formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so called. As a Nationall Church could not formally be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out binding the whole Nation to exercise ordinances of worship in the head Church of it: So by proportion. Yea, government is a thing which doth now <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ccidere</hi> to a Church constituted, and doth not essentially concurre as matter or forme to constitute a Church of this or that kinde. Againe, were this true, that the Diocesan Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Ministers have onely government committed to them, then it will follow, that they onely have the governing of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, who are not any way Pastors of them, ministring Word and Sacraments to them. But this is most absurd, that their proper and ordinary Pastors, who dispence Word and Sacraments to them, should not have <hi>potestatem pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i,</hi> nothing to doe in governing those flockes which depend on them. If any say, they were not <hi>actu,</hi> but they were <hi>virtute potentiae</hi>: I say, it is also to make the Apostles Churches imperfect: and how can this be knowne but by a presumed intention, which hath nothing to shew it, but that after event of things.</p>
            <p>From the effect I argue.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Those Churches which Christ did ordaine, and the Apostles plant, might ordinarily assemble to the ordinances of worship. But a Diocesan Church cannot ordinarily assemble. <hi>Ergo.</hi> For when God will have mercy and not sacrifice, and the Sabboth is for man, he will not for ever ordaine a thing so unequall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, as is the ordinary assembling of a Diocesan multitude. If any distinguish the assumption, and consider a Diocesan as she is in her parts, or as she is <hi>a torum,</hi> standing of her parts now collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and say she may, and doth meet and communicate, and edifie her selfe in the first respect. I answer. This is nothing, and doth prove her to be nothing, as she is a Diocesan Church: <hi>quia quid quid est, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>git secundum quo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>est.</hi> If therefore a Diocesan Church were a reall Church, she must have the effect of such a Church; to wit.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50465:11"/>
assembling, as she is Diocesan. The Synagogues through Israel met Sabboth by Sabboth, but were no Nationall Church in this regard; that is to say, as it is a Nationall Church, it had her Nationall reall meetings.</p>
            <p>I reason thirdly, from the subject.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That Church which doth <hi>per se,</hi> essentially require locall bounds of place, that must have locall limits set forth of God. But a Diocesan Church doth so. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Whence I thus inferre, He who institutes a Diocesan Church, must needs set out the locall bounds of this Church. But God hath not set out any locall bounds of the Church in the New Testament: <hi>Ergo.</hi> He hath not instituted any Diocesan Church. The proposition is certaine: for this doth enter in the definition of a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Church, as also of a Nationall. And therefore God instituting the Nationall Church of the Jewes, did as in a map set forth the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of that Nation. So also if he had instituted Diocesan and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Churches, he would have appointed locall bounds, if not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly described, yet knowne and certaine. But God hath not done this. For the Church of the New Testament is not thus tied to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; it being so with the power of teaching, and the Ecclesiasticall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, that it doth <hi>respicere subditos</hi> onely <hi>perse,</hi> not <hi>terminos locales.</hi> Civill jurisdiction doth <hi>respicere solum</hi> primarily, the subjects on it in the second place. As for that commandement of <hi>appointing Presbyters Citie by Citie,</hi> it is too weake a sparre for this building. Againe, that Church which may be said to be in a Citie, is not Diocesan. But the Churches which the Apostles planted, are said to be in Cities. <hi>Ergo.</hi> If one say to the proposition, they may; because the head Church is in the Citie. <hi>Answer.</hi> The Churches the Apostles planted are taken for the multitude of Saints united into such a body Ecclesiasticall. But the multitude of Saints through a Diocesse cannot be said to be in a Citie. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The soule may be said to be in the head, though it be in other parts; and God in heaven. God, because of his most infinite and indivisible nature. And so the soule, because it is indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, and is as all of it in every part, not as a thing placed in a place containing it, but as a forme in that which is informed by it. But in things which have quantity, and are part out of another, there is not the like reason.</p>
            <p n="4">4 From the adjuncts. That Church which hath no time set, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to assemble, is no Church. I suppose the ground above, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but union of a Diocesse in worship, can make a Diocesan Church. But this Church hath no time. Ordinary it cannot have: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary solemnities God hath not commanded. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is no such Church. For if it be a reall D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ocesan Church, it must have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all action according to that nature of which it is. The action formall of a Church indefinite is to meet and communicate in worship. Of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50465:12"/>
a Nationall Church, is to meet nationally and communicate in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. If then it must meet, it must have some time set downe, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or extraordinary. But God hath done neither. The Churche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which the Apostles planted, were in their times most perfect and flourishing. But Diocesan Churches were not: for in those times they were but in <hi>seminali</hi> infolded, not explicated, as the adversaries confesse.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That which maketh Gods dispensation incongruous to his ministers, is absurd. But a Diocesan frame of Church doth so. <hi>Ergo.</hi> That which maketh God give his extraordinary gifts to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of churches in the Apostles times, when now they had but one congregation, and give ordinary gifts onely when now they had 800. churches under them, is absurd. But this doth the Diocesan frame. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 The churches throughout which a Presbyter might doe the office of a teaching Presbyter, and a Deacon the office of a Deacon, were not Diocesan. But every Presbyter might minister in the Word and Sacraments throughout the Church to which he was called; so might a Deacon tend to the poore of the whole church, whereof he was a Deacon. <hi>Ergo,</hi> these were not Diocesan. The reason of the proposition is; No Pesbyter can through many congregations performe ordinary ministery. In which regard the Canon law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth that Presbyters should have many Churches, cap. 10. quaest. 3. <hi>Vna plures Ecclesiae vni n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Now to come to open the termes, and lay downe conclusions: whether Diocesan or Parishionall Churches were at the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute.</p>
            <p>First, the word <hi>Church</hi> we understand here, not <hi>figuratively</hi>; taken <hi>Metonymically</hi> for the place, Syn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, for Ministers administring ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>operly,</hi> for a body politick, standing of people to be taught and governed, and of teachers and governours.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it may be asked, What is meant by a Diocesan church? <hi>Answ.</hi> Such a frame in which many Churches are united with one head Church, as partaking in holy things, or at least in that power of government which is in the chiefe Church, for all the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in such, or such a circuit. These phrases of a <hi>Diocesse,</hi> a <hi>Diocesan B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shop,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> are all since the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> yea the two last much later. A Diocesse seemeth from the common-wealth to have beene taken up in the Church, from what time Bishops had Territories, ample demaines, and some degree of civill jurisdiction annexed to them. For a Diocesse by the Lawyers, is a circuit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, such as the Romans Praesidents had: or <hi>active,</hi> an admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of those Provinces with jurisdiction. <hi>L. unica. c. ut omnes sudicet.</hi> And in the Canon law, sometimes <hi>Provincia</hi> and <hi>Diocoesis</hi> are used promiscuously, Dist. 50. cap. 7. But the ancientest use of this word was to note the Territory, or Countrey circuit, opposed to the Citie. Thus the Countrey churches are called <hi>Diocaesanae Ecclesiae, cont. tur. c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Baptismales Ecclesiae</hi> were contra distinguished to Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. These had every one a Diocesse, and the inhabitants were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Diocoesani</hi>: these Churches had a moity of houses dwelling in neighbourhood th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t belonged to them; but at length by a Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche, the whole Church was called a Diocesse; though the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists dispute whether it may be so called, seeing the Diocesse is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50465:13"/>
the meaner part by much, in comparison of the Citie, and should not give the denomination to the whole. So at length the Bishop was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Diocoesanus,</hi> and the Church which had beene called <hi>Ecclesia civita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, matrix, nutrix, Cathedralis,</hi> grew to be called <hi>Diocesan.</hi> But here we take a Diocesan Church for such a head Church, with which all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in such a circuit hath reall union, and communion in some sacred things. Now a Diocesan Church may be put <hi>objectivè,</hi> that is, for a Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h in which are ministers and ministery for the good of the whole Diocesse, though they should never assemble, as the worship in the Church of Jerusalem was for all Judea, and profited, though absent. Or it may be put formally for a body politicke, a congregation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers through a Diocesse, with the ministers of the same, having some reall union and communion in sacred things. We deny any such Church.</p>
            <p>A Parishionall Church may be considered <hi>Materially</hi> or <hi>Formally</hi>; M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>erially, as it is a Church within such locall bounds, the members whereof dwell contiguously one bordering upon the other. This God instituted not, for it is accidentall to the Church, may <hi>abesse</hi> and <hi>adesse,</hi> a Church remaining one. If a Parishionall Church in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don should dwell, as the Dutch doe, one farre enough from the other, while the same beleevers were united with the same governours, the Church were not changed, though the place were altered. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is put formally, for a multitude which doe in manner of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish ordinarily congregate; such Churches, and such onely we say God erected.</p>
            <p>Now for some Conclusions, what we agree in, then what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 1. Churches of Cities, Provinces, Kingdomes, may be called Diocesan, Provinciall, Nationall Churches; as the Churches of the world are called Oecumenicall, yea haply not without warrant of Scripture: As 1 Pet. 1.1. writing to all those dispersed Churches, speaking of them singularly, as of one flocke, 1 Pet. 5.2. The reason is, things may be called not onely as they are really in themselves, but according to some respect of reason, under which we may apprehend them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 2. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here may be a reall Diocesan, Nationall, or head Church, wherewith others should be bound to communicate more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly in Word and Sacraments, and in some more reserved cases con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their government. This was done in the Church of Judea. Our men are too shie, that feare to come to this proposition, <hi>de posse.</hi> I am sure our adversaries will grant us, that our Parishionall frame might have beene so constituted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus</hi> 3. That there cannot be such a frame of Church, but by Gods institution. No Ministers can take this honour, but they must
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50465:13"/>
(as <hi>Aaron</hi>) be called to it. When nothing in nature can have further d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gree of perfection, then the author of nature putteth into it; how much more must the degree of perfection and eminence in things Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, depend on God? We may reason from the Church of Judea, as <hi>à pari,</hi> to prove, That there cannot be such a Church, but that all subordinates must communicate with the chiefest head Church in some sacred things, which may make them one Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h. Thus there would not have beene a Church Nationall of the Jewes, but that all the Nation had union and communion together even in the worship and ordinances of worship. The men onely went up, so the male onely were circumcised: but the female representatively went up in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It is enough if the communion be in government, which all our opposites grant necessary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This maketh then rather one <hi>in tertio quodam separabili,</hi> then one Church: government being a thing that commeth to a Church now constituted, and may be absent, the Church remaining a Churc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shops, when now they were divided, did keep all other, who were the Bishops presbyters strictly so called, and the people also in some communion with the head Church; for in greater solemnities one and other went up thither. See <hi>decret. dist.</hi> 3. <hi>dist</hi> 38.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conclus.</hi> 4. We agree in this, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Churches were in their first plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either not actually Diocesan, being one congregation without any other subordinate, or if they had any, yet were they imperfect, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many parts or members of particular Churches, which belonged to them.</p>
            <p>That wherein we contradict one another, is, we affirme that no such head Church was ordained either virtually or actually, but that all Churches were singular congregations, equall, independent each of other, in regard of subjection. Secondly, we say, were there a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan granted, yet will it not follow, that Parish churches should be without their government within themselves, but onely subject in some more common and transcendent cases. As it was with the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues and that Nationall Church of the Jewes, and as it is betwixt Provinciall and Diocesan Churches. If any say there is not the same reason of a Diocesan Church and Parishionall: for that hath in it all the perfection of a Church. I answer, not; taken in comparison to a Provinciall Church, it is but a part and member, and hath not perfection, no more then a parochiall Church hath, compared with a Diocesan.</p>
            <p>Now followeth to answer the Arguments first proposed.</p>
            <p>To the first, I answer to the proposition by distinction. Those who ordained that the <hi>Civita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>

                  </gap>bs</hi> people taken in regard of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50465:14"/>
whole multitude of the one, and locall bounds of the other, should make but one Church, they did institute a Diocesan church. But those who so instituted a Church in Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, Suburbs, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey that their number might bee compared fitly to one congregation, they did not therefore ordaine a Diocesan Church. Againe to the assumption. But those who use <hi>City by City,</hi> and <hi>Church by Church</hi> as equivalent (which the Apostles doe) they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y, Suburbs, and Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y should make but one Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h. I answer by the like distinction. They who use <hi>City by City,</hi> people being taken for the whole multitude within the extent of these locall bounds, as equivalent with <hi>Church by Church,</hi> they may be said to have ordained that city, suburbs and territories, should make but one Church. But th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the Apostles doe not use them, as of equall signification. For the City had a reason of an ample continent, the Church of a thing contained. These phrases are, the one proper, the other metonymicall, and are therefore to bee expounded the one by the other. Hee placed Presbyters <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, lest we should understand it of the multitude and locall bounds, it is said in the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles that they placed them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Church by Church: because Presbyters were not given but to Disciples and Christians now converted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut of the multitude and locall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites wherewith cities were bounded. Secondly, there is an <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate</hi> acception of these phrases <hi>per accidens,</hi> not because the citie and church was to make but one church, but because the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by occasion of their number, not being then too great, were framed into one church; or because by occasion there was yet but one church, not because there was to be but one. Now hee who thus us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th them promiscuously, doth imply that one church was as yet constituted, not that there was to be but one through the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of city, suburbs, and countrey. Thus likewise it is easi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to the proofe of the proposition: For thus the multitude of citizens converted and unconverted, could not be a church of one congregation yet the number of those who in city, suburbs, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, were actually converted, was no more then might be ordered into one church and the Apostles framing these into one on the present occasion, did not exclude the after constituting of any other within the same locall bounds.</p>
            <p>To the second Argument: and first, the objection from the Nationall church of the Jewes. I answer, denying the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That the Synagogues being many, made one church; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were all one Kingdome, one posses<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion. For thus there was one Oecumenicall church, when the world was under one
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50465:14"/>
Emperour, and of one profession. It is accidentall to the unity of a Church whether the kingdome be one or no. If Israel, when God had divided the kingdome into two, had gone up to Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, and kept there communion in the worship of that Church, they had still been one Church, though two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. If here were as many Kings and Kingdomes as have beene in England, so many as should belong to one Provinciall Church, should bee one Church, though ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y Kingdomes. The truth is, they were one Church, because they had union and Nationall communion in the ordinances of worships, which were in that one Church to which they all belonged. The high Priest was their proper Priest, hee made intercession for them, blessed them, they were not to offer any where, but there. If any thinke this cannot bee the cause, why there were one Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the governement of one high Priest, for then should <hi>Aaron</hi> have beene as well as <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To the second instance of Hierusalem; we deny the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. It might be intended for a head and mother Church in regard of order, and yet not bee a Nationall Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power over oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs: If it should have beene a head, having power accordingly, as it was a mother Church, it should have beene head to all the world. Secondly, wee deny the Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the Apostles ever intended, that it should be a head to Christian Churches through Judea: as it had beene before under the High Priest. That constitution was typicall, and may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plead for an universall Christian Church, then for a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Secondly, there is not the least intimation of Scripture this way. Thirdly, had this D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vinity beene knowne, the Fathers would not have suffered, that it should have beene made a Diocesan church, and subjected to Caesarea. To the Prosillogisme. The Church which was so numbersome, that it could not meete or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, could not bee a Parishionall Church. This was so. Ergo, &amp;c. To the proposition I answer. That which was by inhabitants, who had <hi>fixum domicilium,</hi> so numbersome that it could not meete, I grant it. But so this was not; by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent often many others were there <hi>in transitu.</hi> Secondly, nay wee read that they did meete ordinarily, as is above said, and in that deliberation about which the Church of Antioch did send to them, <hi>Irenaeu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Luke</hi> affirmeth the same. As for that of millions of beleevers, it is certaine, they were not fixed members of this Church.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion. The Apostles seeing such times to ensue, wherein many of them should translate themselves, and be dispersed hither and thither. God letting it grow a while more ranke and aboundant then ordinary Churches are to be, because it was <hi>Ecclesiae surcularis,</hi> many of whose branches were to be transplanted in their time. Yea, had there beene five thousand set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led members, we read of some ordinary Auditories, sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Touching the third instance, As to the first reason, The proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is denyed: for naming the rest of Achaia with them, doth no more signifie the subjection of all Achaians, ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in the 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.2. naming all Saints in every place, doth signifie their subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The second reason, hath the sequell of the proposition denied: for the contrary is rather true. He who without any note of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence calleth the church of Corinth by the name of Achaia, he doth imply that it is but one particular church equall with the other churches in Achaia. To the third, the proposition is againe denied, That he that speaketh of all the churches as one, doth imply a metropolitan church. For by the first conclusion we may speake of things not onely as they are really, but according to any respect of reason, under which they are apprehended. Againe, the assumption is false: He speaketh not of them as one church, but as divers churches in one Province. But it is named and set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hers. Ergo. &amp;c. The sequell is againe denied. For it may be named before other, because it is the most illustrious and conspicuous church; but not because it hath any power over other. Finally, it is too grosse to thinke, that all in Achaia came to Corinth to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed and make their contributions, every church using the first day of the weeke when they assembled to make their collections within themselves.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50465:15"/>The fourth instance is <hi>Crete</hi>; where the many churches in that Iland, so full of cities, are said to be one church of Crete, whereof <hi>Titus</hi> was Bishop.

            <p>The fifth instance. Phillip. 3. That church, which was in the chiefe citie of Macedonia, must needs be at least a Diocesan. But the church of Philippi was so. Ergo. This will prove an argument, when churches must needs be conformed to the civill regency of the Emperour: his foure chiefe Governours called <hi>praefecti praetorii,</hi> his presidents of Provinces under them, and inferiour Judges, and Magistrates, under these in one citie, and the regions of it. But this is an errour giving ground to a Patriarchall and Oecumenicall church, as well as a Provinciall and Diocesan. This rule of planting churches varieth at mans pleasure: For the Romane Provinces af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the people of Rome gave up their right to the Emperour, were brought all into one, under one head and Monarch, and Provinces have beene diversly divided from time to time. From this Monarchie arose the Popes plea against the Greeke churches for his Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call soveraignty. What forme of churches must we have amongst them who never received any such government, nay any constant govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all. If I were a conformitant I should object otherwise for a Provinciall church in Philippi: viz thus. That church wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y Bishops are not in the Provinciall citie, though many are in a Provinciall church.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the churches of Asia. I answer to the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the first Syllog. by distinction. One church may conteine others, as an example doth conteine in it a thing exemplified: or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50465:16"/>
as a head Church doth Churches united in subjection to it. Those Churches which conteine all other in the latter sence, it is true, they were at least Diocesan: but in this sense the assumption is denyed. The same answer fitteth the Prosyllog. He that writing to these, writeth to all other by vertue of their subjectionall subordination, he doth imply that all others are conteined in these as member Churches under one head. But he who writing to these, writeth to all other as exemplified onely in them, he doth not imply any such thing. Now this is manifest, because he writeth to seven Churches: whereas this were superfluous, if Christ did intend his letter one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to head Churches conteyning other. For then five Churches should have beene written to onely, seeing in them all others were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned, as they say. For by law of this virtuall continency, Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia and Thiatira were included in two of the other, viz. Sardis, and Pergamus, which were their mother cities. What needed he have named Philadelphia and Thyatira, which by law of this virtuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency did intend to direct his letter onely to head Churches? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the assumption is false: For he doth write principally to the seven, and to all other Churches in Asia no further then he writeth to all the Churches in the world. There were other Churches in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, such as were Colosse, Hierapolis, Troas, the Church at Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, and Assos, which the Centuries mention, which depended not on those seven. If Colosse and Hierapolis were not, as L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>odicaea, reedified when John did write the Revelation, yet these other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were not extant. Not to name Magnesia and Tralles, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependancy whereof is fully cleared whatsoever Doct. Downam ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth.</p>
            <p>To the third reason; from Christs manner of concluding his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, it is answered by denying the assumption. For Christ doth not use the plurall number in respect of that one Church preceding, but in respect of the seven collectively taken, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will that the members of each singular Church should lay to heart both severally and joyntly, what ever was spoken to them and to others.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the Ecclesiasticall examples, as of Rome, and Alexandria, two hundred yeares after Christ. And first to answer the reason brought for their increase, such as could not keepe still in a Parishionall meeting. The proposition is not of necessary consequence; for there were very extraordinary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of that which was effected in the Church of Jerusalem: From Christ himselfe, from the residence of all the Apostles; from the state of the people there assembled; from the state of that Church; from the time in which these were done. Christ
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50465:16"/>
had prayed for them particularly, to which some attribute the first miraculous conversion by Peters preaching. Againe, it was fit, that being now ascended into his glory, he should there more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly display his power, and more conspicuously swallow up the scandall of his crosse. Againe, this Church had the labour of all the Apostles for a time in it: whose care and industry we may guesse by their ordination of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>acons, that they might not be distracted. Thirdly, the confluence and concourse to H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erusalem was of much people, who though explicately they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Christ; yet had in them the faith of the Messiah, and therefore were neerer to the kingdome of God then the common Heathen. The state of this Church was such, that it was to send out light to all other, a common nursery to the world. Finally, the time being now, the beginnings of planting that heavenly Kingdome, seeing beginnings of things are difficult, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the Lord did reveale his arme more extraordinarily. It doth not therefore follow from this particular, to the so great encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of these churches in tract of time, Nay, if these other Churches had enjoyed like increase in their beginnings, it would not follow, as thus. <hi>Those Churches which within a few yeares had thus many in them, how numbersome w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re they many yeares after</hi>? Because the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things hath a Period set, after which, even those things which a great while encreased, doe decrease and goe downward, as it was in Jerusalem. Not to mention, that we deny the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</p>
            <p>But though the Argument is but Topicall, and can but breed an opinion onely, yet the testimonies seeme irrefragable. Tertullian testifying that halfe the Citizens in Rome was Christians. And Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius, that there was besides himselfe, and 45. Presbyters, a number-some Clergie.</p>
            <p>I answer, That Tertullians speech seemeth to be somewhat Hyperbolicall: for who can beleeve that more then halfe the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and world, after a sort, were Christians? But he speaketh this, and truely in some regard, because they were so potent through the world, that if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hey would have made head they might have troubled happily their per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y they were halfe of them Christians, not because there were so many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut because there were so many who did beare some favour to their cause, and were it as safe as otherwise, would not sticke to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urne to them. But Tertullian knew no Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which did not meet, having prayers, exhortations, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering all kindes of censures: If therefore there were more Churches in Rome in his time, it will make little for Diocesan Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50465:17"/>Touching <hi>Cornelius</hi>: we answer. It is not unlike but auditories were divided and tended by Presbyteries. <hi>Cornelius</hi> keeping the Catherall Church, and being sole Bishop of them: but we deny that these made a Diocesan Church. For first, the Cathedrall and Parochiall Churches were all within the Citie, in which regard he is said, <hi>Officium Episcopi implevisse in civitate Romae.</hi> Neither was his Church as ample as the Province, which that of Foelicissimus sufficiently reacheth. Secondly, we say that these Parochiall churches, were to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h as had liberty of Baptizing, and therefore could not be severed from communion with the head Church.</p>
            <p>Now to answer further, it is beyond 200. yeares for which our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is taken. For there is reason why people which had beene held toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her must we thinke that an Emperour, as <hi>Philippus,</hi> favouring the faith, did not bring on multitudes to the like profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Secondly, we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lius</hi> which may not well stand, that the Church of Rome, though now much increased, did not keepe together as one Church.

               </gap>ndant, but that all the members of it had union and communion, for the mutuall edifying and restoring one of another. And I would faine know, whether the seven Deacons, seven Subdeacons, two and forty Acolouthes, whether those exorcistes, L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ctors, Porters about two and fifty are so many, as might not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in a Congregation of fifteene or twenty thousand? Surely the time might well require them, when many were to be sent forth to doe some part of ministery more privately. Not to name the errour of the Church in superfluous multiplications of their Presbyters, to vilifying of them, as they were superfluous in the point of their Deacons. There were six<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

True it is, the Congregation could not but be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great, and might well be called in a manner innumerable, though it were but of a twenty thousand people. But because of that which is reported touching division by <hi>Evaristus, Hyginus, Dionisius,</hi> and

            <p>Concerning the objection from the Churches of Belgia, or the low Countries, we deny the proposition: for we cannot reason thus: <hi>If many Masters, and distinct forme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it is one thing, when sheepe feed together in one common Pasture, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hey bite not on the same individuall grasse: Another thing when now they are tended in diverse sheepe-gates. Not to urge, that in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Discipline, they may communicate as one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>Touching the objection from Geneva: I answer to the propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by distinction. <hi>Those who subject themselves to a Presbyterie, as not having power of governing themselves within themselves, as being under it by subordination, these may in effect, as well be subject to a Consistorie: But thus the twenty foure Churches of Geneva doe not.</hi> They or have power of governing themselves, but for greater edification, voluntarily confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, not to use nor exercise their power, but with mutuall communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one asking the counsell and consent of the other in that common Presbytery. Secondly, it is one thing, for Churches to subject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to a Bishop and Consistory, wherein th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y shall have no power of suffrage: Another thing to communicate with such a Presbytery, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themselves are members and Judges with others. Thirdly, say, they had no power, nor were no members in that Presbytery, yet it is one thing to submit themselves to the government of Aristocrasie, another to the Bishops Monarchicall government. For while his Presbyters are but as Counsellours to a King, though he consulteth with them, he alone governeth. Geneva made this consociation, not as if the Prime Churches were imperfect, and to make one Church by this union: but because though they were intire Churches, and had the power of Churches, yet they needed this support in exercising of it, and that by this meanes the Ministers and Seniors of it might have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But what are all the foure and twenty Churches of Geneva to one of our Diocesan Churches?</p>
            <p>Now to answer the reasons. The first of them hath no part true: the proposition is denyed. For these Churches which had such Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons as the Apostles instituted were Parishionall, that is, so conjoyned that they might and did meet in one Congregation.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50465:18"/>
The Doctor did consider the slendernesse of some of our Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, and the numbersome Clergy of some Cathedrall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but did not consider there may be Presbyteries much lesser, and Congregations ampler and fuller, and yet none so bigge as should require that multitude he imagineth, nor made so little as might not have Presbyters and Deacons. What though such Maior and Aldermen as are in London cannot be had in every Towne, yet such a Towne as Cambridge may have a Maior and Aldermen as Cambridge aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But they will not seeme to speake without reason; the Scripture say they placed City by City Presbyters, and therefore in such Churches as occupied Citie, Suburbes, and Countrey, which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishionall ones doe not. But may not a Church of one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be in a Citie, without occupying limits of Citie, Suburbes, and Countrey? and if Presbyters be placed in such a Church, may they not bee said to be placed in Cities? Indeed if the Presbyters placed in Cities were given to all the people within such bounds; the case were other; but the citie is not literally thus to be understood, but metonymically for the Church in the Citie. Neither was the Church in the city, all within such bounds; for the Saints of a place and Church of a place, are all one in the Apostles phrase of speech. As for that which is objected from Ecclesiasticall history, it is true, that in processe of time, the Bishop onely had a company of Presbyters. Before, Churches kept in one Congregation and had all their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. Churches should so have afterward beene divided, that all should have beene alike for kinde, though in circumstantiall excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy some were before other.

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> We deny the assumption: viz. That those Presbyters of Ephesus were Diocesan Bishops. It is most plaine they were such who did <hi>Communi consilio</hi> tend the feeding and government of the Church; such Bishops whereof there might be more then one in one congregation. The common glosse referreth to this place that of <hi>Ierom</hi>: that at first Presbyters did by common councell governe the Churches. Yea, Doct. <hi>Downam</hi> doth count Ephesus as yet to have had no Bishop, who was sent unto them after <hi>Pauls</hi> being at Rome, as he thinketh. And others defending the Hierarchie, who thinke him to have spoken to Bishops, doe judge that these words belong not to the Presbyters of Ephesus, but are spoken in regard of others toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then present with them, to wit, of <hi>Timothy, Sosipater, Tychicus,</hi> who,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50465:19"/>

But the Angels were singular persons in every Church, having Ecclesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Angels were so. Ergo. Againe, Those to whom onely Christ did write, who onely bare the praise, dispraise, threatning, in regard of what was in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In the two first syllogismes the assumption is denyed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the first Prosyllogisme the consequence of the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>position is denied, That they must needs be seven singular persons. For se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven singular starres may signifie seven Vnites, whether singular or ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregative: seven pluralities of persons who are so united as if they were one. And it is frequent in Scripture to note by a unity, a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted multitude. Thirdly, the consequence of the proposition of the last prosyllogisme is denyed. For though we should suppose singular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons written to, yet a preheminency in order and greater authority, without majority of power, is reason enough why they should be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to singularly, and blamed, or praised above other. Thus the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of a Colledge, though he have no negative voyce, might be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to, and blamed for the misdemeanours of his Colledge, not that he hath a power over-ruling all: but because such is his dignity, that did he doe his endeavour in dealing with, and perswading others, there is no disorder which he might not see redressed. Fourthly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the assumption may be denyed: That they are onely written to. For though they are onely named, yet the whole Churches are written to in them; the supereminent member of the Church by a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche put for the whole Church. For it was the custome in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times, and long after, that not any singular persons, but the whole Churches were written unto, as in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles is manifest, and in many examples Ecclesiasticall. And that this was done by Christ here, the Epiphonemaes testifie. <hi>Let every one beare what the spirit speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Churches.</hi>

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had the dignity of Bishops: for they did not make Bishops onely, but Presbyters also. Now wee must conster the ancient, as taking them onely eminently and virtually to have been Bishops, or else wee must judge them to have been of this minde, That the Apostles had both as extraordinarie Legats, most ample power of teaching and governing suting thereto, as also the ordinary office of Bishops and Pastors, with power of teaching and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, such as doe essentially and ministerially agree to them: which indeed Doctor <hi>Downam</hi> himselfe confuteth, as Popish, and not without reason, though while hee doth strive to have <hi>Iames</hi> both an Apostle and a Bishop properly, himselfe doth confirme it not a little.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it will not be unprofitable to shew some reasons why the Apostles neither were nor might be in both these callings.</p>
                  <p>First, That which might make us doubt of all their teaching, and writing, is to bee hiffed forth as a most dangerous assertion. But to make <hi>Iames,</hi> and so any of them, have both these offices in proprietie, might make us doubt. Ergo. The assumption proved thus. That which doth set them in office of teaching liable to errour, when they teach from one office, as well as infallibly directed with a rule of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble discerning, when they teach from the other, that doth make us subject to doubting in all they teach and write. But this opinion doth so. Ergo. The proposition is, for ought I see, of necessarie truth, the assu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ption no lesse true. For if there bee any rule to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <hi>Iames</hi> infallibly, as hee was formally the ordinary bishop of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, let us heare it: if there were none, may not I question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all his teaching and writing were not subject to errour? For if hee taught them as an ordinarie bishop, and did write his Epistle so, then certainly it might erre. If he did not teach them so, then did hee not that hee was ordained to, neither was hee properly an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Pastor, but taught as an extraordinarie Embassadour from Christ.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Those offices which cannot bee exercised by one, but the one must expell the other, were never by God conjoyned in one person. But these doe so. Ergo. The assumption is manifest. Because it is plaine, none can be called to teach as a Legat extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, with infallible assistance, and unlimited jurisdiction, but he is made uncapable of being bound to one Church, teaching as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary person, with jurisdiction limited to that one Church. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, one can no sooner bee called to doe this, but at least the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of the other is suspended. Thirdly, that which is to no end, is not to bee thought to bee ordained of God. But to give one an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie authority whereby to doe this or that in a Church, who
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50465:22"/>
had a higher and more excellent power of office, whereby to doe those same things in the same Church, is to no end. Ergo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it will be denied that any other power of order, or to teach and administer sacraments was given, then that he had as an Apostle: but onely jurisdiction or right to this Church as his Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi> To this I reply, first, that if hee had no new power of order, he could not be an ordinary Bishop properly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally so called. Secondly, I say power of governing ordinary was not needfull for him who had power as an Apostle in any Church where hee should come. <hi>Object.</hi> But it was not in vaine, that by assignation hee should have right to reside in this Church as his Church. <hi>Answer.</hi> If by the mutuall agreement in which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>h the Church of the Jewes, and the whole circumcision, as they by occasion resorted thither, then by vertue of his Apostleship hee had no lesse right to tend those of the circumcision by residing here, then the other had right to doe the same in the Provinces through which they walked. But they did thinke it meete that hee should there tend that Church, and with that Church all the Circumcision, as they occasionally resorted thereto. Ergo. For though hee was assigned to reside there, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if it were assigned to him for his abode, as hee was an Apostolicke Pastor, what did hee need assignation under any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther title. Nay he could not have it otherwise assigned, unlesse wee make him to sustaine another person, viz. of an ordinary Pastor, which hee could not bee who did receive no such power of order as ordinary Pastors h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that calling which hee could not exercise without being much abased, that hee never was ordained unto, as a point of honour for him. But he could not exercise the calling of an ordinary B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shop, but hee must bee abased. Hee must bee bound by office to meddle with authority and jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but in one Church, hee must teach as an ordinary man lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to errour. Ergo, hee was never ordained to bee a Bish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>p properly. If it bee sacriledge to reduce a Bishop to the degree of a Presbyter, what is it to bring an Apostle to the degree of a Bishop? True it is, hee might have beene assigned to reside con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly in that Church without travelling, and be no whit aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: but then he must keepe there a Pastor of it with Apostolicall authority, caring not for that Church, but the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Jewes, which hee might doe without travelling.

                     </gap>ither or thither. Honour and ease are seldome bed-fellowes. Neither was <hi>Iames</hi> his honour in this circumstance of the rest, but in having such an honourable place wherein to exercise his Apostolicke calling. As for that question, who was their ordinary Pastor, it is easily answered. Their Presbyters, such as <hi>Linus,</hi> or <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> in Rome, such as Ephesus and other Churches had. <hi>Iames</hi> was their Pastor also, but with extraordinary authority. What needed they an ordinary Bishop, which grew needfull (as the favourers of the Hierarchy say) to supply the absence of Apostles, when now they were to decease? What needed then here an ordinary Bishop where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were joyntly to keepe twelve yeares together, and one to reside during his life, according to the current of the story? Thus much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the first instance.</p>
                  <p>To the second instance of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and the argument dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen from it. First, we deny the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oposition. For had some ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pastors beene so stiled, it might imply but a preheminencie of dignity in them above other: wherefore unlesse this be inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is unsound, viz. <hi>Those ordinary Pastors, who are called Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in comparison of others, because the Apostles did give to them po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of ordination, jurisdiction, and peerelesse preheminency, which they did not give to others, they are above others.</hi> Secondly, the Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is false altogether: First, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was an ordinary Pastor: Secondly, that hee was called an Apostle in comparison of inferiour Pastors of that Church. <hi>Obi.</hi> But the judgement of <hi>Ierom, Theodoret, Chrysostome,</hi> is that he was. <hi>Answ.</hi> The common judgement is, that he was an egregious teacher of theirs, but further then this, many of the testimonies doe not depose. Now so he might be: for he was an Evangelist, and one who had visited and laboured among them and therefore might be called their teacher, yea an egregious teacher, or Doctor of them. Nay, Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth plainely insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, that he was an Evangelist: for he saith he was made their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle by the Apostle, while he sent him to exhort them, and because he was a good man, he was desired of the people.

Philippians, because hee was a good man, not because hee was their ordinary Pastor. <hi>Ieroms</hi> testimony on this place doth not evince.

For even <hi>Theodoret</hi> doth take him to have beene such an Apostolicke person as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were. Now these were as truly called bishops as the Apostles themselves. Neither is the rule of <hi>Theodore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> to bee admitted: for it is unlike that the name of Apostle should bee communicated then with ordinarie Pastors, where now there was danger of confounding those eminent Ministers of Christ, with others, and when now the Apostles were deceased, that then it should cease to bee ascribed to them. Againe, how shall wee know that a bishop is to bee placed in a Citie, that hee must bee a person thus and thus (according to <hi>Pauls</hi> Canons) quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: all is voided, and made not to belong to a bishop. For those who are called bishops, were Presbyters and no bishops, bishops being then to be understood onely u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For they are presupposed to have and exercise power Episcopall for the materiall of it, as Apostles had also; but not to have and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise in that manner and formallity which doth agree to a Bishop, but which doth agree to an Evangelist, and therefore they are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to doe the worke of an Evangelist, to exercise all that power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If wee should reason then thus: Hee who did exercise Episcopall power in these churches, he is presupposed to have beene bishop in them. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is not true, but with limitation: Hee who exercised Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall power after that formall manner, which doth agree to the office of a Bishop, hee was Bishop; but not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

power <hi>secundum aliam rationem &amp; modum</hi>: viz. after such a manner at doth agree to an Apostle.</p>
                  <p>To the second maine proofe, wee deny the proposition. If patternes for Bishops, then written to Bishops. The reason is, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Evangelists, ordinary Pastors, have many things common in their administration. Hence is it, that the example of the one may be a patterne to another, though they are not identically and formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of one calling. Councells have enjoyned all Presbyters to be well seene in these Epistles, as being patternes for them, <hi>Vide Aug. De doctrin. Christ. cap.</hi> 16. <hi>lib.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>To the third reason. <hi>Who so prescribing them their duties doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the very duties of Bishops, bee doth take them to have beene Bishops.</hi> The Proposition is not true without a double limitation. If the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle should propose such duties of Bishops as they in later times usurped, he doth not therefore presuppose them bishops, because th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ord doth ascribe and appropriate to bishops, yet if he doe not prescribe them as well in regard of matter as forme exercised by them, it will not follow that he doth take them for bishops: not that <hi>Paul</hi> doth purpose the very duties of bishops, both in substance and manner of performance. Secondly, we deny him to purpose for substance the duties of bishops. For hee doth not bid him or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, as having a further sacramentall power then other Ministers, nor governe with power directive and corrective over others. This exceedeth the bounds of all ministeriall power.

                     </hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> was not therefore Evangelists because they did write the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, for then none should have beene Evangelists that had not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but in this regard they were more renowned then other. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome hath so prevailed, saith <hi>Maldonate</hi> in his Preface on <hi>Matthew,</hi> that wee call them Evangelists, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Writers of the Gospells) whom the Scriptures never call Evangelists. These Evangelists <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of were given at Christs ascension, but the first writer of the Gospell, being an Apostle, was at least eight yeares after. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they were a distinct order of workemen from the Apostles, but two of the penmen of the Gospels were Apostles. Thirdly, they were such as by labour of ministery (common for the generall of it to all other) did gather Saints, and build Christs Body. Now writing the Gospell was not a labour of Ministery common to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, but the publishing of it.</p>
                  <p>Those degrees which Christ did distinctly give to othersome, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hersome, those he did not give conjoynedly to one and the same persons. But these callings he gave to some one, to others another. Else he must have said, he gave the same men to be Apostles and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists, the same to be Evangelists and Pastors. Ergo.</p>
                  <p>That calling which is not compatible with the calling of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist, that <hi>Paul</hi> never annexed to an Evangelist. But the call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng of a bishop is such. For a bishop is tyed to a particular Church. The calling of an Evangelist is a calling whereby one is called to the worke of the Ministery, to gather Saints, and edifie Christs body, without any limitation to any particular Church. Ergo, <hi>Paul</hi> never annexed the calling of a bishop to an Evangelist.</p>
                  <p>The calling of an Evangelist is not to write the Gospell, nor to preach it simply: for then every Minister of the Word should be an Evangelist. But this doth difference them, to preach it without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation or assignation to any particular church. Thus <hi>Phillip</hi> thus all those who were the Apostles helpers, working the work of the Lord as they did were Evang. of which sort some continued to the time of <hi>Commodus</hi> the Emperour, as <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now a calling whereby I am thus called to publish the Gospel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fixing my selfe in any certaine place; and a calling which bindeth during life to settle my selfe in one Church, are incompatible.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, that which would have debased <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> did not put upon them. But to have brought them from the honour of serving the Gospell, as <hi>Collaterall</hi> companions of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles to be ordinary Pastors, had abased them. Ergo, this to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Pastors <hi>Paul</hi> did not put upon them. <hi>Object.</hi> The assumption it denyed, it was no abasement. For before they were but Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and afterward by imposition of hands were made bishops.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50465:27"/>
why should they receive imposition of hands, and a new ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they did not receive an ordinary calling? we meane if they were not admitted into ordinary functions by imposition of hands. I answer, This deny all with all whereon it is builded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> grosse: For to bring them from a Superiour order to an Inferiour, is to abase them. But the Evangelists office was superiour to Pastors. Ergo. The assumption proved. First, Every office is so much the greater, by how much the power of it is of ampler extent and lesse restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But the Evangelists power of reaching and governing was il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited. Ergo. The assumption proved. Where ever an Apostle did that part of Gods worke which belonged to an Apostle; there an Evangelist might doe that which belonged to him. But that part of Gods worke which belonged to an Apostle he might doe any where without limitation. Ergo. Secondly, every Minister by how much he doth more approximate to the highest, by so much he is h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gher. But the companions, &amp; coadjutors of the Apostles, were neerer then ordinary Pastors. Ergo. Who are next the King, in his Kingdome, but those who are <hi>Regis Comites.</hi> The Evangelists were <hi>Comites</hi> of these Ecclesiasticall Cheiftaines. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> doth expresly say on Ephes. 4. That the Evangelists in an ambulatory course spreading the Gospell, were above any bishop or Pastor which resteth in a certaine Church. Wherefore to make them Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters is a weake conceite. For every Prsbyter (properly so called) was constituted in a certaine Church to doe the worke of the Lord in a certaine Church, But Evangelists were not, but to doe the worke of the Lord in any Church as they should be occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Ergo, they were no Presbyters properly so called. Now for their ordination; <hi>Timothy</hi> received none as the Doctor conceiveth, but what hee had from the hand of the Apostle and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, when now he was taken of <hi>Paul</hi> to be his companion. For no doubt but the Church which gave him a good testimony, did by her Presbyters concurre with <hi>Paul</hi> in his promoting to that office. Obj. What, could they lay on hands with the Apostles, which <hi>Phillip</hi> could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and could they enter one into an extraordinary office? Answ. They did lay on hands with the Apostles, as it is expresly read, both of the Apostles and them. It is one thing to use preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory imposition, another to use miraculous imposition, such as the Apostles did, whereby the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost were conferred. In the first, Presbyters have power. Neither is it certaine, that <hi>Phillip</hi> could not have imposed hands, and given the Holy Ghost. For though he could, he might choose in wisedome for their greater confirmation and edification to let that be done by persons more eminent. Finally, imposition of hands may be used in promoting and setting one forth to an extraordinary office.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50465:27"/>
For every extraordinary office is not attended with immediate vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from God. As the calling of Evangelists, though extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, was in this unlike the calling of Apostles and Prophets. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, men called immediately may be promoted to the more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full exercise of their immediate and extraordinary callings by imposition of hands from their inferiours, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were. Howsoever, it is plaine, that <hi>Timothy</hi> by imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sition of hands, was ordained to no calling, but the calling of an Evangelist. For that calling he was ordained to, which he is called on by <hi>Paul</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, and fully execute. But he is called on by him to doe the work of an Evangelist. Ergo, that calling he was ordained to.</p>
                  <p>That worke which exceedeth the calling of an ordinary bishop, was not put upon an ordinary bishop. But <hi>Titus</hi> his worke did so: for it was to plant Presbyters Towne by Towne through a Nation, Ergo. For the ordinary plantation and erecting of Churches to their due frame, exceedeth the calling of an ordinary bishop. But this was <hi>Titus</hi> his worke. Ergo. Bishops are given to particular Churches when now they are framed, that they may keepe them winde and wether tight, they are not to lay foundations, or to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie some imperfect beginnings. But say <hi>Titus</hi> had beene a bishop: he is no warrant for ordinary bishops, but for Primates whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority did reach through whole Ilands. Nay, if the Doctors rule out of <hi>Theodor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t</hi> were good, it would serve for a bishop of the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality cut. For it is said he placed Presbyters city by city, or Towne by Towne, who are in name onely bishops, but not that he placed Angels or Apostles in any part of it. He therefore was the sole bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of them, the rest were but Presbyters, such as had the name, not the office and government of Bishops.</p>
                  <p>Finally, were it granted that they were ordinary bishops, and written to doe the things that bishops doe, yet would it not be a ground for their majority of power in matter sacramentall and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as is above excepted.</p>

                  <p>An order is reputed higher, either because intrinsecally it hath a higher vertue, or because it hath a higher degree of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and honour.

                     </gap>le he is a child, which he hath when he is a man, but yet it is not in a child free from all impediment, that it can actually beget the like. But this is too much to grant. For the power sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall in the Priest, is an actuall power which hee is able to performe and execute, nothing defective in regard of them, further then they be with-held from the exercise of it. For that cause which standeth in compleat actuality to greater &amp; more noble effects, hath an inferior &amp; lesser of the same kind under it also, unlesse the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the matter be intercepted. Thus a Presbyter he hath a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall power standing in full actuality to higher sacramentall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, &amp; therfore cannot but have these inferior of confirmation and orders in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s power, further then they are excepted &amp; kept from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied to him. And therefore power sacramentall cannot be in a Presbyter, as the generative faculty is in a child, for this is inchoate onely, and imperfect, such as cannot produce that effect. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Priest is compleat. Secondly, I say, these are no sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall actions. Thirdly, were they, yet as much may be said to prove an Archbishop a distinct order from a bishop, as to prove a Presbyter and bishop differing in order. For it is proper to him out of power to generate a bishop, other bishops laying on hands, no otherwise then Presbyters are said to doe, where they joine with their bishops. If that rule stand not <hi>major ad minori,</hi> nor yet <hi>equalie ab equall,</hi> I marvel how bishops can beget bishops equall, yea superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to them, as in consecrating the Lord Archbishop, &amp; yet a Presbyter may not ordaine a Presbyter. It doth not stand with their Episcopall majority, that the rule (<hi>every one may give that which he hath</hi>) should hold here in the exercise of their power. Those who are in one order may differ <hi>jure divino</hi> or <hi>humans. Aaron</hi> differed from the Priests not in power sacramentall, for they might all offer incense, and make intercession. But the solemne intercession in the holy of holies
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50465:31"/>
God did except and appropriate to the high Priest the type of Christ. Priests would have reached to this power of intercession in the holy place, or any act of like kinde: but that God did not permit that this should come under them, or they intermeddle in it.

Yea, they say in amplitude of jurisdiction, as in which it is apparant an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop exceedeth a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But were it manifest that God did give bishops Pastorall power through their Diocesse, and an Archbishop through his Province, though but when hee visiteth, this would make one differ in order from the other; as in this regard Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists deffered from ordinary Pastors. But that jurisdiction is in one more then another, is not established, nor hath apparency in any Scripture.</p>
                  <p>To the proofes thereof I answer briefly: the one may be a step to the other, while they differ in degrees of dignities, though essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially they are but one and the same order. In this regard it may be sacriledge to reduce one, from the greater to the lesser, if he have not deserved it. As for that of <hi>Ierom</hi> it is most plaine, hee did meane no further order, but onely in respect of some dignities wherewith they invested their bishop, or first Prebyter, as that they did mount him up in a higher seat, the rest sitting lower about him, and gave him this preheminence to sit first as a Consull in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and moderate the carriage of things amongst them: this <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiori gradu,</hi> being nothing but his honourable <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50465:32"/>
may be added a third. That which <hi>Moses</hi> and the 70. Seniors were, that are the bishops and Presbyters. First, for the proposition it is not true, for first of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes, they were not orders dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent essenally in their power, but onely in degree of dignity, wherein the high Priest was above others. For every Priests power would have reached to that act which was reserved to the high Priest one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y. Besides, when the high Priest was deceased or removed, the other Priests did consecrate the successour, as <hi>Sadock.</hi> Finally, the one had for substance the same consecration that the other, neither had the high Priest any majority of directive or corrective power over others. So the Apostles, and 72. will not be found different in order; and therefore those who resemble these cannot be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be of divers orders. For the Apostles and 72. differ no more then ordinary messengers who are impolyed in a set course, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary sent by occasion onely: They were both messengers, the Apostles <hi>babitu</hi> and abidingly, the other in act onely, and after a transitory manner.</p>
                  <p>Againe, had <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes beene divers orders, differing essentially in the inward power of them, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> is not the proposition true, but with addition in this wife. Those who are indentically and formally that which <hi>Aaron</hi> and the Apostles were, and that which his sonnes, and the 72. were, they differ in degree essentially, not those who were this analogically by reason of some imperfect resemblance. For things may be said to be those things wherewith they have but imperfect similitude. In this sense onely the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is true.</p>
                  <p>Now to come to the assumption. First, touching <hi>Aaron,</hi> wee deny any bishop is as <hi>Aaron</hi> by divine institution, or by perfect si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude answering to him. But because <hi>Aaron</hi> was the first and high Priest, others inferiour: so it hath pleased the Church to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this pollicy, and make the bishop, as it were <hi>Primum Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> or <hi>Antistuem in primo ordine,</hi> Presbyters <hi>in secundo.</hi> Whence B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shops may be said to be that which <hi>Aaron</hi> was through the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ordination, which she framed, looking to this patterne of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which God himselfe had set out in the old Testament. The fathers call them <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes onely for some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon analogy, which through the ordinance of the Church arose betwixt the bishops and Presbyters, and them; and conceive them to be so by humane accommodation, not by divine institution. But that they were so properly succeeding them as orders of Ministery typified by them by Gods owne appointment, this the fathers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght. Christs priesthood, no mans, was properly typified in <hi>Aaron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:50465:32"/>So touching the other part of the assumption, That Bishops and Presbyters are what Apostles, and the 72 were. The fathers many of them insist in this proportion, that as the Apostles and 72 were teachers, the one in a higher, the other in an inferiour or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, so bishops and Presbyters, were by the Churches ordinance. This is the fathers phrase, to call them Apostles, who in any manner resemble the Apostles to call them, as <hi>Ambrose.</hi> Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, Doctors, who resemble these, and come in some common analogie neerest them, <hi>Moses</hi> and the 70 Seniors, who in any sort resembled them. Now the assumption granted in this sense ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not against us. For th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y might be said these, if there were but diverse degrees of dignity amongst them, though for power of order by Gods institution they were all one. But some straine it further, and take it, that Christ instituting those two orders, did in so doing, institute B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shops and Presbyters, the one whereof suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Apostles, the other the 72. and that thus the Fathers take it. To which I answer, First, in generall, this analogy of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and 72: is not generally affected by them all. <hi>Ignatius ad Smyrnenses dicit Apostolis Presbyteros successisse, Diaconos</hi> 72. <hi>discipulis. Clem. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Const. cap.</hi> 30. saith, That Bishops answer to God the Father, Presbyters to Christ, Deacons to the Apostles. <hi>Ierom</hi> doth manifestly make Presbyters (whom hee also calleth by name of Bishops in that Epistle, where hee maintaineth the Presbyters dignity) successours to the Apostles. The like hath <hi>Cyprian, Apostolus id est Episcopos &amp; preposiros,</hi> that is, <hi>ordinis ratione prepositos minorum Ecclesiarum,</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh, else it should bee all one with the former; when hee maketh the Presby<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er as well as the Bishop to bee ordained in the Apostles. Finally, these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who take the 72. to have beene Apostles, as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, could not imagine this porportion of diverse or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders let up in them. Secondly, if Christ in these instituted those other, it must bee one of these waies. First, hee did make these not onely Apostles, but Bishops, and so the 72. not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his messengers for the time, but Presbyters also. Or, secondly, else hee did ordaine these as he did raine Nanna, noting and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuring as by a type, a further thing which hee would worke: viz. that he would institute B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shops and Presbyters for Teachers ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in his Church: but both these are <hi>gratis</hi> spoken without any foundation or reason. For the first, wee have shewed that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles could not bee Bishops ordinarily; nor yet the calling of these seventy two (which was to goe through all Cities Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing) stand with Presbyters, Presbyters being given to Churches <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and there fixed. Neither can the latter be true for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50465:33"/>
then Christ should have given a Sacrament, when he ordained his Apostles, and sent forth his 72. Secondly, the type or the shadow i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> lesse then the thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ypified, the substance of it. But the giving Apostles was a greater thing then giving ordinary Pastors. Ergo. Thir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly, I say, that Christ did never ordaine that any should suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Apostles, or the 72 in regard of their order. There is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble succession, <hi>in g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus the Apostles have no successors succeeding them <hi>in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> but such onely as follow them, being of other degrees, and in another line, as it were, in which sort every Pastor doth succeed them. But then they are said to succeed them, because they follow them, and after a sort resemble them, not because they hold the places which the Apostles did properly. <hi>Apostolo in quantum est A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolus non succeditur, Legato quitenus est Legatus non succeditur.</hi> Fourthly, that the Presbyters doe as persons of a diverse order suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Apostles n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50465:33"/>
one then to another. <hi>Object.</hi> This is denyed, for the Apostles are said to have kept the power of ordination, and the coercive power in their owne hands, and to have committed these in the end onely to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolike men, as <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> who were their successours, succeeding them in it. <hi>Answ.</hi> A notable fiction: for it is most plaine by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that ordination, power of deciding controversies, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, were given to Presbyters, and not kept up from them; they should otherwise have provided ill for the Churches which they left to their care. Secondly, if the Apostles did commit some ordinary power of government to some men above others, in which regard they should be their successours, then the Apostles did not onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy as <hi>Legates</hi> power over the Churches, but as ordinary Ministers. For what power they enjoyed as <hi>Legates,</hi> this they could not <hi>aliis Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> Power as ordinary Pastors in any Nations or Churches they never reserved, and therefore did never substitute others to themselves in that which they never exercised nor enjoyed. And it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that this opinion of Episcopall succession from the Apostles is grounded on this, that the Apostles were not onely Apostles, but Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in Provinces and particular Churches. For the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves urged with this, that the Apostles have none succeeding them, they doe consider a double respect in the Apostles, the one of <hi>Legates,</hi> so <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any other could have a successour. The other of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, <hi>Oecumenicall</hi> in <hi>Peter,</hi> of Bishops Nationall or Diocesan, as in some other. Thus onely considered, they grant them to have other Bishops succeeding them: For the Apostolick power precisely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, was <hi>Privilegium personale simul cum persona extinctum.</hi> Now we have proved that this ground is false, and therefore that succeeding the Apostles, more appropriate to Bishops then other Ministers grounded upon it, is false also.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the Presbyters cannot be said successors of the seventy two. For first, in all that is spoken to the seventy two, the full duty and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Presbyter is not laid downe. Secondly, it doth not appeare that they had any ordinary power of preaching or baptizing and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistering the other Sacrament. For they are sent to Evangelize, to preach the Gospell: but whether from power of ordinary office, or from commission and delegation onely for this present occasion it is doubtfull. Thirdly, it is not read that they ever baptized, or had the power of administring the Supper given to them: Yea, that they had neither ministery of Word or Sacraments <hi>ex officio ordinario,</hi> seemeth hence plaine; That the Apostles did choose them to the Deacons care, which was so cumbersome that themselves could not tend the ministery of the Word with it, much lesse then could these not having such extraordinary gifts as the Apostles had. Fourthly, if they were set Ministers, then were they Evangelists in destination. For the act

Hath not an Archbishop a distinct ordination or consecration from a Bishop? yet is he not of any order, essentially differing.

Secondly, it is testified by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that ordinar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is wholly denyed. As for the proofe of it. First, we that deny that Evangelists h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, I answer to the assumption. That Presbyters were to be placed in Churches framed where there were Presbyters, or where there were as yet none. In the

In the latter Churches which were to be constituted, they may be conceived as Evangelists, with sole power of setting Presbyters forth by this rite of imposition of hands. We hold Apostles might doe it, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists might, and the Presbyteries also. Yea, Presbyters in Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria when now their first Presbyter was d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sh. We grant therefore that antiquity doth sometime speake of the ordainer as one. In the Churches of Affrica one did not lay on hands, yet in some other Churches the rite was by one administred. And it is to be noted by the way, that <gap reason="foreign">

They might therefore by their Canons be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, because regularly and canonically the executing of it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them. This is all that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> or <hi>Ierome excepta ordinatione</hi> can prove. But these two conclusions we would see proved out of scriptures and Fathers. First, that ordination is an action of power, of order, a power sacramentall, which a Presbyter hath not. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that by vertue of this power, the bishop doth ordaine, and not by Ecclesiasticall right or commission from the Church. Certainly, the act of promoting a minister of the Church, is rather an act of jurisdiction then order. As it belongeth to policy and government, to call new Magistrates, where they are wanting. <hi>Object.</hi> But a new spirituall officer may be instituted by a sacrament. <hi>Answ.</hi> If God would so have collated the grace of spirituall callings; but he hath appointed no such thing. The Apostles and 72. were not institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a sacrament or imposition of Christs hands. Now the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the grace was which was given, the more need of a sacrament whereby it should be given. <hi>Object.</hi> They were extraordinary. <hi>Answ.</hi> They might have had some ambulatory sacrament for the time.

                     </gap>ving extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary graces, Acts 8. Secondly, were it a sacrament, it should conferre the grace of office, as well as grace sanctifying the person to use it hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

grace in their behalfe. For the sacramentall collating of grace san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying all callings, we have in these two sacraments of Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. Thirdly, there are many kindes of imposition of hands in the old and new Testament, yet cannot it be proved, that it is any where a proper sacrament. It is then a rite, a gesture, a ceremony, signifying a thing or person separate, presented to God, prayed for to God. Thus Antiquity did thinke of it, as a gesture of one, by prayer to God, seeking a blessing on every one chosen to this or that place of ministery. So Ecclesiastically it was used in baptising, in consecrating, in reconciling penitents, as well as ordaining: but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver granted as a sacrament in those other cases by grant of all.

Hence it is, that they imposed hands even on Deaconesses, where it could not be otherwise considered then a deprecative gesture. Neither is it like the African Fathers ever thought it a sacrament, which no other had vertue and power to minister, but the Bishop. For then they would never have admitted Presbyters to use the same rite with them. For so they had suffered them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane a sacrament, wherein they had no power to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. <hi>Object.</hi> If one say they did lay on hands with them, but the Bishops imposition was properly <hi>Consecrative</hi> and sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The assumption is denied: they did not place them, as the chiefe ordinary Pastors in those churches, but placed them to teach and governe, <hi>in fore interno</hi>; with a reference of subordination to a more eminent Pastor, which when now they were growen to a just multitude should be given to them. The Apostles had all power of order and jurisdiction: they give to Presbyters power of order, power to teach, minister sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and so gather together a great number of those who were yet to be converted; but kept the coercive power in their owne hands, meaning, when now by the Presbyters labour, the churches were growne to a greater multitude, meaning (I say) then to set over them some more eminent Pastors, Apostolicall men, to whom they would commit the power of government, that so they might rule over both the Presbyters and their Churches; and to these with their successours, not to the Presbyters, were the churches recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. All which is an audacious fiction, without any warrant of Scripture, or shew of good reason. For it is confessed that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were placed at the first constitution, as the Pastors and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Churches. Now if the Apostles had done this with reference to a further and more eminent Pastor and Governour, they would have intimated somewhere this their intention: but this they doe not; yea, the contrary purpose is by them declared. For <hi>Peter</hi> so biddeth his Presbyters feed their flocks, as that he doth insinuate them subject to no other but Christ, the Arch shepheard of them all. Againe, the Apostles could not make the Presbyters Pastors without power of government. There may be governours without pastorall power; but not a Pastor without power of governing.

               <p>That which is found in all other orders of Ministers instituted by Christ, may be presumed likewise in the order of Pastors and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: but in all other orders, there were none that had singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of preheminence and majority of power above other: No A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, Prophet, Evangelist had this rule one over another: If the proposition be denied, upon supposall of a different rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because that though parity in a few extraordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters might be admitted without disorder, yet in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ordinary Ministers, it could not but breed schisme and confusion, and therefore as the order of Priesthood was divided into
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50465:41"/>
a high Priest, and other secondary ones, so is it fit that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the new Testament should be devided, some being in the first, and some in the second ranke. To this I answer, the parity is the more dangerous, by how much the places are supereminent. Secondly, though Pastors should be equall, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t this would not bring parity into the Ministers of the Church, some whereof should bee in degree inferiour to other, the governing Elders to the Pastors, and the Deacons to them. Thirdly, if every Church being an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall body, should have governours every way equall, there were no feare of confusion, seeing Aristocracy, especially where God ordaineth it, is a forme of gouernment sufficient to preserve order. But every Church might then doe what ever it would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it selfe. Not so neither; for it is subject to the censure of other Churches synodically assembled, and to the civill Magistrate, who in case of delinquency, hath directive and corrective power over it. Parity doth not so much indanger the Church by schisme, as impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doth by tyranny subject it. As for the distinction of Priests, wee grant it; but as man could not have made that distiction, had not God ordained it in time of the old Testament, no more can we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the new. Howbeit, that distinction of Priests did bring in no such difference in order and majority of rule, as our Bishops now challenge.</p>

But no Pastor or Teacher dependeth on an other but Christ for any of these. Ergo. The proposition standeth on a sufficient enumeration: the assumption may be proved in the severall parts of it. The former branch is thus cleared. First, the power we have, is the same essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially with theirs; yea, every way the same. Secondly, wee have it as imediately from Christ as they.

Nothing lesse. All grant that Christ doth immediately give it, even as the inward grace of every Sacrament commeth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally from him. The Church, did she give this power, might make the sacrament and preaching which one doth in order, no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, no preaching. The Pope doth not (if we follow the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tenent) challenge so much as to give the power of order to any bishop or priest whatsoever. If you say, the Presbyter is ordained by the bishop, that is nothing: so is the bishop by other bishops, from whom notwithstanding he receiveth not this power. We will take this as granted of all: though the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h is, all doe not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it from right grounds. But it will be said the Presbyter is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in jurisdiction, and can have none but what is derived to him from the bishop, who hath the fulnesse of it within his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Church. But this is false, and grounded on many false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions. As first, that Ministers of the Word are not properly and fully Pastors; for to make a Pastor, and give him no help against the Wolfe, is to furni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h him forth imperfectly. Secondly, it presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the power of jurisdiction to be given originally and fontally to one person of the Church, and so to others, whereas Christ hath committed it <hi>originaliter</hi> and <hi>exercitative</hi> to the representative Church, that they might Aristocratically administer it. Thirdly, this presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the plenitude of regiment to be in the bishop, and from him to be derived to other: which maketh him a head of virtuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, that in his Church, which the Pope doth challenge in regard of all bishops. For his headship and spirituall soveraignty standeth according to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this, that the government of all <hi>in for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> externo,</hi> is committed to him. Not to mention, how bishops, while they were bishops, gloried of their chaire and teaching, as the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their garland, preferring it farre before government, but when they were fallen from their spirituall felicity, and infected with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular smoke, then they recommended the labour of teaching to the Presbyters, then their jurisdiction and consistory did carry all the credite, every office in the Church being counted a dignity, as it had more or lesse jurisdiction annexed; as those are more or lesse honourable in the Common-wealth, which have civill authority in lesse or greater measure conjoyned. The truth is, it cannot be shewed that God ever made Pastor without this jurisdiction; for whether it do agree to men as they are Pastors, or as they are Prelats in the Church, it cannot be avoided but that the Pastor should have it, because though every <hi>Praesul</hi> or <hi>Pralatus,</hi> be not a Pastor, yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pastor is <hi>Pralatus,</hi> in order to that Church where he is the proper
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50465:42"/>
and ordinary Pastor. Yea, when censure is the most sharp spirituall medicine, it were ill with every Church, if he who is resident alwayes among them as their spirituall Phisition, should not have power in administring it. Thirdly, I say, no Minister hath majority of power in applying the power of order or jurisdiction to this or that person. In the application there is a ministery of the Church interposed: but so that Christ onely is the cause with power, not onely why Presbyters are in the Church, but why <hi>Thomas</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> is chosen to and bestowed on this or that place. A Master onely doth out of power take every servant into his house: so God in his. God did choose <hi>Aarons</hi> sonnes with the Levites, and Christ the 70. not medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately leaving it to the arbitrement of any to set out those that should stand before him. God doth ever onely in regard of authority, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all power Ecclesiasticall to every particular person, his sole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority doth it, though sometime as in ordinary callings, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of others doth concurre. The Church is in setting out, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining this or that man, as the Colledge is in choosing, when she taketh the man whom the statute of her founder doth most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly describe, or where the Kings mandate doth strictly injoyne, it would otherwise bring an imperiall power into the Church. For though many Kings cannot hinder but that there shall be such and such officers, and places of government as are in their Kingdome, yet while they are free at their pleasure to depute this or that man to the places vacant, they have a Kingly jurisdiction in them. Briefly, God doth ever apply the power Ecclesiasticall unto the person: sometime alone by himselfe, as in the Apostles, and then he doth it <hi>

Or as the Count Palatine hath ordinary Judges, who are <hi>habitu tantum judices,</hi> having none under them, amongst whom they may exercise jurisdiction. Or as the University giveth the degree of a Doctor in Physicke, without any patients among whom he may practise. But Gods Ministery is the calling of a man to an actuall administration, <hi>Goe teach</hi>: and the power of order if nothing by the way, but a relative respect, founded in this, that I am called to such an actuall administration. Now there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an act commanded, without the subject about which it is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied: otherwise, God should give them a faculty of feeding, and leave them depending on others for sheep to feed; God should make them but remote potentiall Ministers, and the Bishop actuall, Thirdly, the Holy Ghost is said to have set the Presbyters over thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A man taking a steward, or other servant into his house, doth give him a power of doing something to his family; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinketh of taking servants, further then the necessity of his houshold doth require: so is it with God in his Church, which is his house: fore the exegency of his people so require, he doth not call any to the function of Ministery. Againe, this is enough to ground the authority which Antichrist assumeth: For some make his sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty to stand onely in this, not that he giveth order or power of jurisdiction, but that he giveth to all Pastors and Bishops the moity of sheepe, on whom this their power is exercised, Christ having given him the care of all his sheepe, <hi>feed my sheepe</hi>: so <hi>Vasquez.</hi> Thus if a Bishop challenge all the sheepe in a Diocesan flocke to be his, and that he hath power to assigne the severall flockes under him, he doth usurpe an Antichristian authority. Finally, if the Churches be the Bishops through the Diocesse, Ministers then are under them in their Churches, but as a Curate is, whom a Parson giveth leave to helpe within his Church. Yea, they should loose their right in their Churches, when the Bishop dieth, as a Curate doth when the Parson of this or that Church, whom he assisted, is once departed. To conclude, they are not dependant (one Minister I meane on another) in the exercise and use of their calling. A servant that hath any place, doth know from his Master what belongeth to it. The Priests and Levites had set downe what belonged to their places, as well as the high Priest what belonged to his. Againe, God hath described the Presbyters office, as amply as any other. A Legate dependeth on none for instructions, but on him that sendeth him; now every Minister is an Embassadour of Christ. By their reason a Minister should be accountant to man for what he did in his Ministery, if his exercising of it did depend on man. Then also

Moreover, should the bishop bid him not preach at al, preach rarely, teach onely such and such things, or come and live from his charge, he should not sinne in obeying him. But man cannot limit that power of ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which he cannot give.

Morall is Civill or Ecclesiasticall. Civill is either Lord-like and ruling, or ministeriall and servile. So Ecclesiasticall, taken large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for all power subjectively in, or objectively about the Church, is either Lord-like and Regall, such as is in Christ, or it is ministeriall and servile, such as is in the Church and the principall members of it.

This ministeriall power is no supernaturall vertue or quality inherent in the soule: but a relative respect founded on this, that I am called by God to this or that actuall administration in his Church. For it is not a power simply, whereby a man is made able to doe some supernatural act, which he could not before in any manner performe: but it is respectively said a power, in as much as it doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to doe those acts in the Church of God lawfully, and <hi>ex officio,</hi> with which before he might not intermeddle. The power of a Deacon, Pastor, Evangelist, Apostle, belong to one predicament in regard of that which is the genus or common nature of them: the power of the Church cannot be other. Naturall and civill power doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with vertue and efficacy reach those effects and ends to which they are designed: because they are proportioned to them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not their activity: but Ecclesiasticall power cannot thus concur to the end and effects for which it is ordained: because they are such as the omnipotenty of God onely can produce, asthe converting or creating grace in the heart of a sinner, to which no supernaturall vertue in man can by any reall, though instrumentary efficacy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conclus.</hi> 3. God hath not given ministeriall power to any, which himselfe is not personally to discharge, nor in further plenitude then that by himselfe it may be performed. The reason is, because God cannot give one the charge of doing more then a mans proper industry can atchieve, but he must withall put it in a mans power to take others, and to impart with them power of teaching and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, so farre as may supply that defect which is in his strength to performe it alone. He that will have the end, will have that without which the end cannot be attained. If God would have any one an universall pastor to all the Churches of the world, he must needs allow him power to substitute Pastors here and there, deriving unto them power both to teach and governe, so far as may supply his absence in the Pastorall cure. If I will have one keepe my flockes which goe in twenty sheepe-gates, if I commit them to one, I must needs together give him leave to assume unto himselfe such as may be under shepheards to him. Thus if God give a Bishop the plenitude of Pastorall care and government over all the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shionall Churches through a Diocesse, he must needs together al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him this power, of being a head of internall influence, even a head virtually communicating with others part of pastorall power, whether teaching or government. Thus should none but Bishop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be <hi>ex officio</hi> servants in Pastorall cure to God: all others should be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50465:45"/>
immediately and formally servants to the bishop, and doe every thing in the name of the bishop, being immediately onely and in a remote sense the servants of God: as in the former comparison of one servant receiving from his master the care of all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tockes, he is the masters servant to whom the master committeth the trust, from whom he onely looketh to see it performed: but those whom this shepheard taketh to himselfe for his aid, they come under his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and are servants to him. If it be said, that God doth not thus make the bishop Pastor, but that he wil likewise that there be parish Pastors under him, and helps of government. To this I answer, If God will have them, then either after his owne de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ignement, or else leaving it to the bishops arbitrement: if he leave it to the bishops arbitrement, then the objection before is in force, God will looke for the cure from him onely, he shal take according to his judgment, such as may helpe him. If God will have them after his owne design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then he giveth the bishop no more Pastorall power then he can discharge himselfe, others having their right in all the bishop cannot execute, as well as the bishop, and as immediatly from Christ. Some write, as if the Apostles had the plenitude of all Pastorall power, that from them it might be derived to the Church, it being seene through nature, that inferiour things receive influence from the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour. But they misconceive the matter; they had onely a power to serve the Church with the personall service of their Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as Christ gave the one order, so the two other also, for the gathering of the Saints, and exaedifying of the body of Christ: and no person in any ranke had any power to do this or that in the Church further then himselfe might performe in person. The steward in a house hath full power of a steward, but not the power of all other officers, as Clark of the kitchin, B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the power of one may be about more noble acts then the power of another, or in the same kinde, the power of one may be more extended, and the power of another more contracted.

This power ministeriall tending to execute the pleasure of Christs corrective power, was committed to some in extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degrees, personally and singularly, and might be so in some cases exercised by them.

This without doubt was in the Apostles and Evangelists: and it was needfull it should be so: first, because it might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovefull there to excommunicate whereas yet Churches were not risen to their perfect frame: secondly, because there might be some persons not setled as fixed dwellers in any Church, whom yet to be cast forth was very behovefull.

That ordinarily this power is not given to any one singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by himselfe to exercise the same, but with the company of others constituting a representative Church: which is the point next to bee shewed.

For then Christ should give not some, but all the members of the Church to be governors of it. Fourthly, Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> speaketh it of such a Church to whom wee may ordinarily and orderly complaine: now this we cannot to the whole multitude. Fiftly, this Church he speaketh of, he doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose it as the ordinary executioner of all discipline and censure. But the multitude have not this execution ordinary, as all but <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius,</hi> and such Democritall spirits doe affirme. And the reason ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the sentence of the Church, doth shew that often the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it is but small: <hi>For where two or three are gathered together in my name.</hi> Whereas the Church or congregations essentially taken for teachers and people, are incomparably great. Neither doth Christ meane by Church the chiefe Pastor, who is virtually as the whole Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For first, the word Church doth ever signifie a company, and never is found to note out one person. Secondly, the Bishop may be the person offending or offended, and the Church to which he must bring the matter, must be other then himselfe. Thirdly, the gradation doth shew it. First, by thy selfe, <hi>Then shew a witnes or two. Then to the Church,</hi> as the sinne increaseth, the number of those by whom it is to be rebuked and censured, increaseth also. If one say, though the Church signifie one governour, yet the gradation hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, for to tell it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urch taken here to note some eminent governour, it might be brought in as a further degree, though one onely were enforced. But how can <hi>Peter</hi> be complainaint, if <hi>Peter</hi> the Praesul onely be the judge to whom the thing must be denounced. Fourthly, the church in the Corinthians which <hi>Paul</hi> stirreth up to censure the incestuous person, was not any one but many. Their rebuke upon which it is like he repented, was a rebuke of many, 2 Cor. 2.6. Fiftly, if the church had been one, he would not have subjoyned: <hi>for what ye shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Where two or two or three are assembled in Gods name, God is in the midst of them to doe that they agree on. But where the Church is binding or loosing, there

Secondly, were the power in the church, the church should not onely call them, but make them out of vertue and power received into her selfe: then should the church have a true Lordlike power in regard of her Ministers.

                     </gap>m the jurisdiction is premised, then the Church receiving and execucing it may be one.</hi> A most false Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whose contrary is true. The reason is, because the church typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Peter</hi> is properly and really a church, not figuratively and improperly: for then <hi>Peter</hi> should have beene a figure or type, of a type or figurative church. The figure therefore and type being of the church which is properly taken, and the church properly and really taken, being a company assembled, hence it is that (<hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17.) the church cannot signifie one; for one is but figuratively and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly a church. There is not the same reason of the figure and the thing that is figured. Nay hence an Argument may be retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, proving that by that church whereof <hi>Peter</hi> was a figure, is not meant one chiefe Governour. <hi>Peter</hi> as one man or Governour was properly and really a virtuall church and chiefe Governour. But <hi>Peter</hi> as one man and Governour was in figure onely the church. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. Ergo, that church <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. is not a virtuall church, noting forth one chiefe Governour onely. As for <hi>Cyprians</hi> speech, it doth nothing but shew the conjunction of Pastour and people by mutuall love, which is so streight that the one cannot be schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally left out, but the other is forsaken also. Otherwise I thinke it cannot be shewed to the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, that the Bishop was counted the church; or this dreame of a virtuall church once imagined. The Clerkes of the church of <hi>Placentia</hi> did in their oath of canonicall obedience sweare thus: <hi>That they would obey the Church of Placentia, and the Lord their Bishop.</hi> Where the Chapiter doth carry the name of the church from the Bishop. Yea, even in those times preposed, or set before him, when the Pope was lifted up above ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councels, then it is like was the first nativity of these virtuall churches. As for a Kingdome I doubt not, but it may be put for a King figuratively: but the church typified by <hi>Peter,</hi> must needs be a church properly. And it will never be proved that any one Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was set up in a church proportionable to a King in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, in whom is all civill power whereby the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is administred.</p>

The truth is, the Apostle might have judged him to be excommunicate; and an Evangelist, if present, might have judged him also to be excommunicate, and yet place left for the Churches judgement also.

Here it may be objected, that if place be left for the Churches judgement after the Apostles sentence; then the Church is free not to excommunicate where the Apostles have, and the same man should bee excommunicate and not excommunicate. <hi>Ans.</hi> Suppose the Apostles could excommunicate <hi>Clave errante,</hi> Without cause, it is true.

Yes, where she should see just cause of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating she is not (though none call on her) free not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate. Neverthelesse, though she is not free, so as she can lawfully not excommunicate, yet she is free, speaking of freedome absolutely and simply, and if she should not excommunicate him, hee should remaine not excommunicable but excommunicate, by chiefe judgement, yet it should not be executed, by the sinister fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a particular Church. As, say <hi>Sauls</hi> sentence had beene just, and the peoples favour had beene unjust, <hi>Ionathan</hi> had beene under condemnation, but execution had beene prevented by the peoples he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To the fourth, <hi>That one is fitter for execution then many.</hi> To which we may adde, that though the Bishops be but as Consuls in a Senat, or Vice-chancellors in a University, having when they sit with others, no more power then the rest. Yet these have execution of many things committed to them. The assertion. viz. <hi>That many are lesse fit for execution,</hi> we deny. That order is fittest which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted. But he doth commit the keyes to the Church, to many, that they might exercise the authority of them; when that mean is most fit, which God will most blesse, and his blessing doth follow his owne order, this is the fittest. Secondly, in the Apostles times, and in the times after, almost foure hundred yeeres expired, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did continue with Bishops in governing and executing what ever was decreed. Thirdly, this deprivation from the first order, one to execute for a Diocesan, one for a Provinciall, the decrees of a Diocesan and Provinciall, drew on a necessityof one to execute the decrees of the Oecumenicall Church or Pope. Fourthly, Let them shew where God divided the power of making lawes for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Church from the power to execute them. Regularly they who have the greater committed, have the lesser also. Fiftly, we see even in civill governments many parts by joynt Councell and action are as happily governed as others are by a singular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. Truely, that the Affrican Fathers write to <hi>Celestive</hi> is true: <hi>It is unlikely that God will be present, with one, inspiring him with his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not be present with many who are in his name, and with his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant assembled.</hi> As for those comparisons they hold not in all: they hold in that which the Consull doth in calling the assembly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding things, &amp;c. Yet the Consuls never took the power to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure their fellowes without the concurrence of their fellow Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, nor to withdraw themselves from being subject to the censure of the rest of the Senate.</p>
               <p>To the fift argument, to the proposition by distinction: if they have all power both of ministeriall application, and instituting others out of vertue and authority, then Pastours derive. But this is denyed. She hath no power but of Ministery, and no plenitude but so farre as they in their owne persons can discharge. It presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth therefore we affirme in our question what we doe not. But to let the proposition passe, because of some derivation, it is true. If she have but all power of Ministeriall application, then Bishops

Thus the Church deriveth, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the person whom Christ describeth, and out of power will have placed in this or that office in his Church. This answereth to the last suggestion. For if the Church did virtually, and out of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er make an officer, it is true, as we see with those whom the King maketh in the common-wealth. But if she doe it in Steward-like manner, ministring to the sole Lord and master of his house, then is not he so taken in to doe in his name, but in his masters name. As a Butler taken in by a servant, doth execute his office not in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Stewards name, but in his masters, who onely out of power did confer it on him.</p>
               <p>The last objection I answer. That the particular Church may depose their Bishop. What member soever in the Church is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending person, may be complained of to the Church. The Church of Philippi, if it had power to see that <hi>Archippus</hi> doe his dutie, then it had power to reprove and censure him not doing it. If the Church have power by election to choose one their Bishop, and so power of instituting him, then of destituting also. <hi>Instituere &amp; destituere ejusdem es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No more then the Electors of the Emperour have in them power of the Imperiall dignity. <hi>Answer.</hi> We say therefore, that as the Church hath onely ministeriall power of application, that is, as they cannot out of power call a Pastour, but onely call one whom Christ pointeth out, and to whom Christ out of power gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Surely I marvell men of learning will deny it, when no reason evinceth the Pope though a generall Pastor subject to the censure of a Church Oecumenicall, but the same proveth a Diocesan Bishop subject to the censure of the particular Church. Unlesse they will say with some Schoolmen, <hi>Sot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That the Pope is but the vicar of Christ in the generall Church: but the Bishop is both the vicar of Christ, and also representeth the generall Church in his Diocesse, whence he cannot be proceeded against by the Church that is a particular. As if to be a vicar of Christ were a lesser matter then to represent the generall Church, with whom in his calling the Church Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call hath nothing to doe.</p>
               <p>To that which is objected touching Fathers, Pastors; the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes hold not in all things. Naturall parents are no wayes children, nor in state of subjection to their children: but spirituall fathers are so fathers, that in some respect they are children to the whole Church. So shepherds are no way sheepe, but ministers are in regard of the whole Church. Secondly, Parents and Shepherds are absolutely parents and shepherds, be they good or evill: but spirituall Parents and Pastors are no longer so then they doe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly behave themselves. Besides, are not civill Kings Parents and Pastors of their people? yet if they be not absolute Monarches, it was never esteemed as absurd, to say that their people had power in some cases to depose them. If their owne Churches have no power over them, it will be hard to shew wherein others have such power of jurisdiction over persons who belong not to their owne churches.
