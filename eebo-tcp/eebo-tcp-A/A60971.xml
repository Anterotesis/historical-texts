            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO Mr. Southern; ON HIS COMEDY, Called the WIVES EXCUSE.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>SUre there's a Fate in Plays; and 'tis in vain</l>
               <l>To write, while these malignant Planets Reign:</l>
               <l>Some very foolish Influence rules the Pit,</l>
               <l>Not always kind to Sence, or just to Wit.</l>
               <l>And whilst it lasts, let Buffoonry succeed,</l>
               <l>To make us laugh; for never was more need.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45042:3"/>
Farce, in it self, is of a nasty scent;</l>
               <l>But the gain smells not of the Excrement.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Nymph, a Wit and Beauty too,</l>
               <l>With all her Charms bore but a single show:</l>
               <l>But, let a Monster <hi>Muscovite</hi> appear,</l>
               <l>He draws a crowded Audience round the Year.</l>
               <l>May be thou hast not pleas'd the Box and Pit,</l>
               <l>Yet those who blame thy Tale, commend thy Wit;</l>
               <l>So <hi>Terence</hi> Plotted; but so <hi>Terence</hi> Writ.</l>
               <l>Like his thy Thoughts are true, thy Language clean,</l>
               <l>Ev'n Lewdness is made Moral, in thy Scene.</l>
               <l>The Hearers may for want of <hi>Nokes</hi> repine,</l>
               <l>But rest secure, the Readers will be thine.</l>
               <l>Nor was thy Labour'd <hi>Drama,</hi> damn'd or hiss'd,</l>
               <l>But with a kind Civility, dismiss'd:</l>
               <l>With such good manners as the <note place="margin">The Wife in the Play, Mrs. <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi>
                  </note> Wife did use,</l>
               <l>Who, not accepting, did but just refuse.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45042:3"/>
There was a glance at parting; such a look</l>
               <l>As bids thee not give o're, for one rebuke.</l>
               <l>But if thou wou'dst be seen, as well as read;</l>
               <l>Copy one living Author, and one dead;</l>
               <l>The Standard of thy Style, let <hi>Etherege</hi> be:</l>
               <l>For Wit, th' Immortal Spring of <hi>Wycherly.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Learn after both, to draw some just Design,</l>
               <l>And the next Age will learn to Copy thine.</l>

               <l>GAllants, you're welcome to our homely cheer:</l>
               <l>If you have brought your <hi>English</hi> Stomachs here;</l>
               <l>We'll treat you, as the <hi>French</hi> say, <hi>Cherentine.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And what we want of Humour, or of Wit,</l>
               <l>Make up with your She-Neighbours in the Pit;</l>
               <l>For on the Stage whate're we do, or say,</l>
               <l>The Vizard Masks can find you better play:</l>
               <l>With all our pains, we can but bring 'em in;</l>
               <l>'Tis you must take the Damsels out agen:</l>
               <l>And when we've brought you kindly thus together,</l>
               <l>'Tis your fault if you're parted by foul weather.</l>
               <l>We hope these natural Reasons may produce,</l>
               <l>In every Whoremaster, a kind excuse</l>
               <l>For all our Faults, the Poet's, and the Players,</l>
               <l>You'l pardon us, if you can find out theirs. <hi>[To the Maskers.</hi>

               <l>But to the gentler Men, who love at sight,</l>
               <l>And never care to come to closer fight,</l>
               <l>We have provided work for them to night.</l>
               <l>With safety they may draw their Cannon down,</l>
               <l>And into a Surrender bomb the Town.</l>
               <l>From both side-boxes play their Batteries;</l>
               <l>And not a Bullet shot, but burning Eyes:</l>
               <l>Those they discharge with such successful Arts,</l>
               <l>They fire, three deep, into the Ladies hearts.</l>
               <l>Since each Man here finds his Diversion,</l>
               <l>Let not the damning of our Play be one.</l>
               <l>But to the Ladies, who must sit it out,</l>
               <l>To hear us prate, and see the Oglers shoot,</l>
               <l>Begging their favour, we have this to say,</l>

               <l>MY Character, not being much in Vogue,</l>
               <l>Has drawn me in to speak the <hi>Epilogue:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But, pray conceive me right, not to disparage</l>
               <l>That ancient, <hi>English</hi> Perquisite of Marriage;</l>
               <l>Which, when the Priests first made all Pleasure Sin,</l>
               <l>Faster than they could cheat us, drew us in</l>
               <l>With Rites and Liberties of Cuckolding.</l>
               <l>That us'd to be the Custom, and so common,</l>
               <l>No Girl but wish'd her self a Married Woman.</l>
               <l>Whether I've done my Husband right, or no;</l>
               <l>Most Women may be in the right, that do:</l>
               <l>Our Author does not set up for reforming,</l>
               <l>Or giving hints to Fools who won't take warning:</l>
               <l>He's pleas'd, that other People are pleas'd too,</l>
               <l>To help to reap that Harvest which they sow:</l>
               <l>For among all the Cuckolds of this Town,</l>
               <l>Who show themselves, and are as daily shown,</l>
               <l>Our Poets may make some of 'em their own.</l>
               <l>You find in me what may excuse a Wife:</l>
               <l>Compare at home the Picture with the Life,</l>
               <l>And most of you may find a <hi>Friendal</hi> there;</l>
               <l>And most of you more justly us'd than here:</l>
               <l>Our Author has his ends, if he can show,</l>
               <l>The Women ne'er want cause for what they do:</l>
               <l>For, Ladies, all his aim is pleasing you.</l>
               <l>Some metled Sparks, whom nothing can withstand,</l>
               <l>Your Velvet-Fortune-Hunters, may demand,</l>
               <l>Why, when the means were in the Lady's hand,</l>
               <l>The Husband civil, and the Lover near,</l>
               <l>No more was made of the Wife's Charecter?</l>
               <l>Damn me, cries one, had I been <hi>Betterton,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And struts, and cocks, I know what I had done;</l>
               <l>She should not ha' got clear of me so soon.</l>
               <l>You only fear such Plays may spoil your Game:</l>
               <l>But Flesh and Frailty always are the same:</l>

                  <l>A Wife you may lay aside, but a foolish fond Mistriss,</l>

                  <p>Better, nor worse, than I do of all the young men in Town: For I believe you wou'd now resign her to any body else, with as much satisfaction, as you got her for your self: I know most of those matters end in the benefit of the Publick: and a little of your ill usage (which you will take care to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply her withall) may make her one of the common goods of the Town: But that's a ruine I wou'd prevent if I cou'd: Therefore, to save you the labour of getting rid of her (for that's the only design you have now upon her, I'm sure) I came to spare your good Nature the trouble, by making you a very fair Offer.</p>

                  <p>Very reasonable you shall find me, if you will but give over your far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempts upon her, (which now you may easily be persuaded to I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) and contribute, by your assistance, to my design of marrying her: I will engage my self and interest (which you know is very considerable in my own Sex) to serve you in any other Woman of my acquaintance.</p>

                  <p>But take this advice along with you; Raise the Scene of your affairs above the conquest of a Girl. Some of you Sparks think, if you can but compass a Maiden-head, though but your Taylor's Daughter's, you have setled a reputation for ever. Why, Sir, there are Maiden-heads among the Women of Quality, though not so many perhaps; but there are favours of all kinds to be had among 'em; As easily brought about, and at the same price of pains that you can purchase a Chamber-maids.</p>

I have known Mrs. <hi>Sightly</hi> these seven years—known her! I mean, I have seen her, observed her, followed her: may be there's no knowing a Woman: but in all that time, I never found a freedom, that allowed me any encouragement beyond a friend—May be I have been wanting to my self—. But then she would not throw her self away upon a common Lover; that's not probable: If she had been affectedly reserv'd, I wou'd suspect, the Devil in her heart had stampt the sign of Vertue in her looks, that she might cheat the world, and sin more close. But she is open in her carriage, easie, clear of those arts that have made Lust a Trade—Perhaps that openness may be design—'Tis easie to raise doubts—And still she may be—I won't think she can—till I know more: But <hi>Wittwoud</hi> is, <hi>I</hi> know her, every thing that's mischievous; abandon'd and undone; undone her self, she wou'd undo the Sex: she is to bawd for <hi>VVilding: I</hi> know her bad enough for any trade.

a dying tone, no Lady can out-live it. Mr. <hi>Lovemore,</hi> you might have known me better, than to imagine your fly Flattery, and softly Sing me into a Consent to any thing my Virtue had abhorr'd. But how have I behav'd my self? What have <hi>I</hi> done to deserve this? What encouragement have <hi>I</hi> giv'n you?</p>

                  <p>Perhaps 'tis from the general encouragement of being a Marry'd Woman, supported on your side by that Honourable Opinion of our Sex, that, because some Women Abuse their Husbands, every Woman may. <hi>I</hi> grant you indeed, the Custom of <hi>England</hi> has been very prevailing in that point; and <hi>I</hi> must own to you, an ill Husband is a great provocation to a Wife, when she has a mind to believe as ill of him as she can</p>

                  <p>Why then the Folly's hers: For my part, <hi>I</hi> have known Mr. <hi>Friendall</hi> too long, not to know justly what he deserves; <hi>I</hi> won't justifie his Faults, but because he does not take that care of me he shou'd, must not <hi>I</hi> have that regard to my self <hi>I</hi> ought? What <hi>I</hi> do is for my own sake: Nay what is past, which, by your hints, <hi>I</hi> know you do suspect, <hi>I</hi> own <hi>I</hi> did it; not for the Commendation of your VVit, nor as a Debt to him, but to my self, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing a long Life of Infamy, which in his Follies <hi>I</hi> was Marry'd to; and therefore sav'd my self by saving him.</p>

                  <p>I find I am restor'd, but I was reduc'd to the necessity of a lye to come into favour again; but that's a Necessity that every man of honour must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to, sometimes, that has any thing to manage with the women: For a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that never speaks more than the truth, is never believed to be a Lover: and he that won't lye to his Mistress, will hardly lye with her: So let his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty reward him; the Lady won't, I dare say for her. There must be a cheat upon the sense sometimes, to make a perfect pleasure to the soul: For if the women did but always know what really we are; we shou'd not so often know so much of them as we doe: But 'tis their own faults; they know we can't live without 'em, and therefore ask more of us than we have honestly to give for the purchase. So, very often, they put us upon dissimulation, slattery and false love, to come up to their price. Mrs. <hi>Friendall</hi> went away a little abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: I'm glad she did: for that methinks confesses an obligation which she has not yet in her power to return.</p>

For being seen so often abroad, and visiting with my Wife, I pass upon the formal part of the Town, for a very good Husband; and upon the Priviledge of that Character, I grow intimate with all her Acquaintance, (and, by the way, there's hardly a Family in Town, but I can contrive to come acquainted with, upon her account) there I pick and, and chuse in the very Face of their reverend Relations, and deliver my Billets my self.</p>

                  <speaker>Teaz.</speaker>
                  <p>Why the wicked ways of Living in this Town, are matter enough for the vexation of any Woman, that has a Girl to look after: God's my life! Can't you keep up your Masquerades, in the primitive institution of making Cuckolds, as it us'd to be, without bringing the young Wenches into the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Matrimony before their time? VVhere's my Niece among you? 'tis a burning shame to draw away a poor young Girl into these deboist gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping doings, as you do.</p>

                  <speaker>Teaz.</speaker>
                  <p>Innocent diversion, with a Pox to't! for that will be the end on't, at last: very innocent diversion indeed; why, your Musick-meetings, Dancing-meetings, Masquing-meetings, are all but pretences to bring you together: and when you meet, we know what you meet for well enough; 'tis to the same purpose, in good troth: all ends in the innocent diversion.</p>

                  <p>An untowardly Girl, to be sure, my Cozen <hi>Fanny,</hi> Madam: she has undone her self, and my hopes of a Husband for her: Gad forgive me, <hi>I</hi> have no Patience, when I think upon't: last night, <hi>VVittwoud</hi> forsooth, she carries her to the Musick-meeting; then one <hi>VVilding,</hi> an impudent Whore-mastering fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, he carries her home with him, which <hi>I</hi> cou'd forgive well enough too, if it ended there: but now, when all things were agreed upon, and Mr. <hi>Butty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bun</hi> was to give us a Supper, and sign the Writings, in order to Marry her to
