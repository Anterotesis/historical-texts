         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR Lordship, in the beginning
of the last Letter you honoured
me with, seems so uneasie and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
at my having said too
much already in the Question between us,
that I think I may conclude, you would be
well enough pleas'd if I should say no more;
and you would dispense with me for not
keeping my Promise I made you<note n="*" place="margin">2d Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, p. 167.</note> to answer
the other parts of your first Letter. If this
proceeds from any tenderness in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for my Reputation, that you would not
have me expose my self by an overflow of
Words, in many places void of Clearness,
Coherence and Argument, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
might have been spared; I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it is a piece of great Charity, and such
wherein you will have a lasting Advantage
over me, since good Manners will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me to return you the like. Or should I
in the <hi>Ebullition of Thoughts,</hi> which in me
your Lordship finds as impetuous as <hi>the
Springs of</hi> Modena <hi>mentioned by</hi> Ramazzini,
be in danger to forget my self, and to think,
I had some right to return the general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of length and intricacy without Force,
yet you have secured your self from the Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
of any such Trash on your side, by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65912:3"/>
making<note n="*" place="margin">p 4.</note> 
               <hi>Cobwebs</hi> the easie Product of <hi>those
who write out of their own Thoughts,</hi> which it
might be a Crime in me to impute to your
Lordship.</p>
            <p>If this Complaint of yours be not a Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Warning to me, I cannot well guess at
the design of it; for I would not think that
in a Controversie, which you, my Lord, have
dragg'd me into, you would assume it as a
Priviledge due to your self to be as copious
as you please, and say what you think fit,
and expect I should reply only so, and so
much, as would just suit your good liking, and
serve to set the Cause right on that side which
your Lordship contends for.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I shall always acknowledge the
great distance that is between your Lordship
and my self, and pay that Deference that is
due to your Dignity and Person. But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
though it excludes not good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
will not be managed with all that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
which one is ready to pay in other
Cases. Truth, which is inflexible, has here
its Interest, which must not be given up in
a Complement. <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and
other great Names must give way, rather
than make us renounce Truth, or the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
we have for her.</p>
            <p>This possibly your Lordship will allow, for
it is not <hi>spun out of my own Thoughts;</hi> I have
the Authority of others for it: And I think
it was in Print before I was born. But you
will say however, I am too long in my
Replies. It is not impossible but it may be so.
But with all due Respect to your Lordship's
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65912:3"/>
Authority (the greatness whereof I shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
readily acknowledge) I must crave
leave to say, That in this Case you are by no
means a proper Judge. We are now, as
well your Lordship as my self, before a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
to which you have appealed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which you have brought me: 'Tis the
Publick must be judge, whether your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
has enlarged too far in accusing me, or
I in defending my self. Common Justice
makes great allowance to a Man pleading in
his own Defence, and a little length (if he
should be guilty of it) finds excuse in the
Compassion of by-standers, when they see a
Man causelesly attacked, after a new way,
by a potent Adversary; and under various
Pretences, Occasions sought, and Words
wrested to his disadvantage.</p>
            <p>This, my Lord, you must give me leave
to think to be my Case, whilst this strange
way your Lordship has brought me into this
Controversie; your gradual Accusations of
my Book, and the different Causes your
Lordship has assigned of them; together
with Quotations out of it, which I cannot
find there, and other Things I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of (to some of which your Lordship
has not vouchsafed any Answer) shall remain
unaccounted for, as I humbly conceive
they do.</p>
            <p>I confess my Answers are long, and I wish
they could have been shorter. But the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
I have to find out, and set before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
your Lordship's meaning, that they
may see what I am answering to; and so be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65912:4"/>
able to judge of the Pertinency of what I
say, has unavoidably enlarged them. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be wholly owing to my dulness, or
whether a little perplexedness both as to
Grammar and Coherence, caused by those
numbers of Thoughts, whether of your own
or others, that crowd from all parts to be
set down, when you write, may not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to have some share in it, I shall not
presume to say. I am at the Mercy of your
Lordship and my other Readers in the
Point, and know not how to avoid a Fault
that has no Remedy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordship says,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 4.</note> The World soon grows
weary of Controversies, especially when they are
about Personal Matters, which made your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
wonder that one who understands the World
so well, should spend above 50. Pages in renewing
and enlarging a Complaint wholly concerning
himself.</p>
            <p>To which give me leave to say, That if
your Lordship had so much considered the
<hi>World,</hi> and what it is not much pleased with,
when you published your <hi>Discourse in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Trinity,</hi> perhaps your Lordship had
not so personally concerned me in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
as it appears now you have, and
continue still to do.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship <hi>wonders</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>that I spend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
50 Pages in renewing and enlarging
my Complaint concerning my self.</hi> Your
Wonder, I humbly conceive, will not be
so great, when you recollect, That your
Answer to my Complaint, and the <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
you proposed to <hi>give me and others in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65912:4"/>
that Personal Matter,</hi> began the first Letter
you honoured me with, and ended in the
47th Page of it, where you said, <hi>You suppose
the Reason of your mentioning my Words so often
was now no longer a Riddle to me;</hi> and so <hi>you
proceeded to other Particulars of my Vindication.</hi>
If therefore I <hi>have spent 50 Pages</hi> of my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
in shewing that what you offered in
47 Pages for my <hi>Satisfaction</hi> was none, but
that the <hi>Riddle</hi> was a Riddle still; the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
in the number of Pages is not
so great as to be the Subject of much <hi>wonder;</hi>
especially to those who consider that in what
you call <hi>Personal Matter</hi> I was shewing, that
my Essay, having in it nothing contrary to
the <hi>Doctrin of the Trinity,</hi> was yet brought
into that Dispute; and that therefore I had
reason to complain of it, and of the manner
of its being brought in: And if you had
pleas'd not to have moved other Questions,
nor brought other Charges against my Book
till this, which was the Occasion and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of my First Letter, had been cleared, by
making out that the Passages, you had in
your <hi>Vindication of the Doctrin of the Trinity</hi>
quoted out of my Book, had something in
them against the <hi>Doctrin of the Trinity,</hi> and
so were with just reason brought by you, as
they were, into that Dispute: there had
been no other but that <hi>Personal Matter,</hi> as
you call it, between us.</p>
            <p>In the Examination of those Pages meant,
as you said, for my <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and of other
parts of your Letter, I found (contrary to
what I expected) Matter of <hi>renewing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65912:5"/>
my complaint,</hi> and this I took notice
of and set down in my Reply, which it seems
I should not have done; <hi>The knowledge of the
World</hi> should have taught me better: And I
should have taken that for Satisfaction,
which you were pleased to give, in which I
could not find any, nor, as I believe, any
<hi>intelligent or impartial Reader.</hi> So that your
Lordship's care of the <hi>World,</hi> that it should
not <hi>grow weary</hi> of this <hi>Controversie,</hi> and the
Fault you find of my mis-imploying Fifty
Pages of my Letter, reduces it self at last in
effect to no more but this, That your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
should have a liberty to say what you
please, pay me in what Coin you think fit;
my part should be to be satisfied with it,
rest content and say nothing. This indeed
might be a way not to <hi>weary the World,</hi> and
to save 50 <hi>Pages</hi> of clean Paper; and put
such an end to the Controversie, as your
Lordship would not dislike.</p>
            <p>I learn from your Lordship,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 178.</note> that it is <hi>the
first part of Wisdom,</hi> in some Mens Opinions,
<hi>not to begin in such Disputes:</hi> What the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the World (which is a sort of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
should in your Lordship's Opinion
make a Man do, when one of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Character begins with him, is very
plain: He is not to reply, so far as he
judges his Defence and the Matter requires,
but as your Lordship is pleased to allow;
which some may think no better than if one
might not reply at all.</p>
            <p>After having thus rebuked me for having
been too copious in my Reply, in the next
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65912:5"/>
Words your Lordship instructs me what I
should have answer'd,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 4.</note> That I should have
<hi>clear'd my self by declaring to the World, that
I owned the Doctrin of the Trinity as it has been
received in the Christian Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, as I take it, is a meer <hi>Personal Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of the same Woof with a Spanish <hi>Sant
Benito,</hi> and, as it seems to me, designed to
sit close to me. What must I do now, my
Lord? Must I silently put on and wear this
Badge of your Lordship's Favour, and as one
<hi>well understanding the World</hi> say not a Word
of it, because the World <hi>soon grows weary of
Personal Matters?</hi> If in Gratitude for this
<hi>Personal</hi> Favour I ought to be silent, yet I
am forced to tell you, That in what you
require of me here, you possibly have cut
out too much Work for a poor ordinary
Layman, for whom it is too hard to know,
how a Doctrin so disputed has been <hi>received
in the Christian Church,</hi> and who might have
thought it enough to own it as delivered in
the Scriptures. Your Lordship herein lays
upon me what I cannot do, without owning
to know what I am sure I do not know.
For how the Doctrin of the Trinity has been
always <hi>received in the Christian Church,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
my self ignorant. I have not had time
to examine the History of it, and to read
those Controversies that have been writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it: And to own a Doctrin as received
by others, when I do not know how those
others received it, is perhaps a short way to
Orthodoxy, that may satisfie some Men:
But he that takes this way to give Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

in my Opinion makes a little bold
with Truth; and it may be questioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such a Profession be pleasing to that God
who requires Truth in the inward Parts,
however acceptable it may in any Man be to
his Diocesan.</p>
            <p>I presume your Lordship, in your <hi>Discourse
in Vindication of the Doctrin of the Trinity,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to give it us <hi>as it has been received in the
Christian Church.</hi> And I think your Words,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 87.</note> 
               <hi>viz. It is the Sense of the Christian Church
which you are bound to defend, and no particular
Opinions of your own,</hi> authorize one to think
so. But if I am to own it as your Lordship
has there delivered it, I must own what I
do not understand: For I confess your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Sense of the Church, wholly
transcends my Capacity.</p>
            <p>If you require me to own it with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
Faith, I shall pay that Deference as
soon to your Lordship's Exposition of the
Doctrin of the Church, as any ones. But
if I must understand and know what I <hi>own,</hi>
it is my Misfortune, and I cannot deny it,
that I am as far from owning what you in that
Discourse deliver, as I can be from profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the most unintelligible thing that ever I
read, to be the Doctrin that I <hi>own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether I make more use of my poor
Understanding in the Case, than you are
willing to allow every one of your Readers,
I cannot tell; but such an Understanding as
God has given me is the best I have, and
that which I must use in the apprehending
what others say, before I can <hi>own</hi> the Truth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65912:7"/>
of it; and for this there is no help that I
know.</p>
            <p>That which keeps me a little in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
is, That, if I mistake not, Men of
no mean Parts, even Divines of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and those of neither the lowest
Reputation nor Rank, find their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
fail them on this occasion; and
stick not to <hi>own,</hi> That they understand not
your Lordship in that <hi>Discourse,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
that your 6th Chapter is unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
to them as well as me; whether the
fault be in their and my Understandings,
the World must be judge. But this is only
by the by, for this is not the Answer I here
intend your Lordship.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship tells me, That to <hi>clear my
self</hi> I should have <hi>owned to the World the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
of the Trinity as it has been received,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Answer,</hi> I know not whether in a Dispute
managed after a new way, wherein one Man
is argued against, and another Man's words
all along quoted, it may not also be a good
as well as a new Rule for the Answerer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to what was never objected, and <hi>clear
himself</hi> from what was never laid to his
Charge. If this be not so, and that this
new way of Attacking requires not this new
way of Defence, your Lordship's Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to me here, what I should have done,
will, <hi>amongst the most intelligent and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Readers,</hi> pass for a strange Rule in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
and such as the learnedst of them
will not be able to find in all Antiquity;
and therefore must be imputed to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65912:8"/>
else than your Lordship's great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Did your Lordship in the <hi>Discourse of the
Vindication of the Trinity,</hi> wherein you first
fell upon my Book, or in your Letter; (my
Answer to which, you are here Correcting)
did your Lordship, I say, any where object
to me, that I did not <hi>own the Doctrin of
the Trinity, as it has been received in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church,</hi> &amp;c? If you did, the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was so secret, so hidden, so artificial,
that your words declared quite the contrary.
In the <hi>Vindication of the Doctrin of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
your Lordship says,<note n="*" place="margin">Vindic. p. 239.</note> That my <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were borrowed to serve other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
[whereby, if I understand you right,
you meant against the Doctrin of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity]
<hi>than I intended them;</hi> which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
again<note n="†" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 35.</note> for my <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and insist
<note n="*" place="margin">1b. p. 36, 37, 40, 42, 46.</note> upon for my <hi>Vindication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You having so solemnly more than once
professed to <hi>clear</hi> me and my Intentions
from all suspition of having any part in
that Controversie, as appears farther in the
close of your first Letter,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 132, 133.</note> where all you
charge on me, is the ill use, that others had,
or might make of my Notions, how could
I suppose such an Objection made by your
Lordship, which you declare against, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
accusing your Lordship of manifest Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication?</p>
            <p>If your Lordship had any thing upon
your Mind, any secret Aims, which you did
not think fit to own, but yet would have me
divine and answer to, as if I knew them,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65912:8"/>
this I confess is too much for me, who <hi>look
no</hi> farther <hi>into Mens Thoughts,</hi> than as they
<hi>appear in their Books.</hi> Where you have given
your Thoughts vent in your Words, I
have not, I think, omitted to take notice
of them, not wholly passing by those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations,
which have been drop'd from
your Lordship's Pen; which from another,
who had not professed so much personal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
would have shewn no exceeding good
disposition of Mind towards me.</p>
            <p>When your Lordship shall go on to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
me of not believing the <hi>Doctrin of the
Trinity, as received in the Christian Church,</hi>
or any other Doctrin you shall think fit, I
shall answer as I would to an Inquisitor. for
tho your Lordship tells me,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 5.</note> That <hi>I need not
he afraid of the Inquisition, or that you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to charge me with Heresie in denying
the Trinity;</hi> yet he that shall consider your
Lordship's proceeding with me from the
beginning, as far as it is hitherto gone, may
have reason to think, that the Methods and
Management of that <hi>Holy Office</hi> are not
wholly unknown to your Lordship, nor
have scaped your great reading. Your
Proceedings with me have had these steps,</p>
            <p>1. Several Passages of my <hi>Essay of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Vnderstanding,</hi> and some of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
barely to the Being of a God, and
other Matters wholly remote from any
Question about the Trinity, were brought
into the <hi>Vindication of the Doctrin of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
and there argued against as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Errors of <hi>Those</hi> and <hi>Them,</hi> which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65912:9"/>
               <hi>Those</hi> and <hi>Them</hi> are not known to this
day.</p>
            <p>2. In your Lordship's Answer to my first
Letter, when that was given as the great
reason why my <hi>Essay</hi> was brought into that
Controversie, (<hi>viz.</hi>) because in it <hi>Certainty
was founded upon clear and distinct Ideas,</hi> was
found to fail, and was only a supposition of
your own; other Accusations were sought
out against it in relation to the Doctrin of
the Trinity. <hi>viz.</hi> That<note n="*" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 133.</note> 
               <hi>it might be of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
consequence,</hi> to that Doctrin, <hi>to introduce
the new term of Ideas,</hi> and to <hi>place Certainty in
the perception of the agreement or disagreement
of our Ideas.</hi> What are become of these
Charges, we shall see in the progress of this
Letter, when we come to consider what
your Lordship has reply'd to my Answer
upon these Points.</p>
            <p>3. These Accusations not having, it seems,
weight enough to effect what you intended,
my Book has been rumaged again to find
new and more important Faults in it; and
now at last at the third Effort<note n="†" place="margin">2 Ans. Title. page.</note> 
               <hi>my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Ideas are found inconsistent with the
Articles of the Christian Faith.</hi> This indeed,
carries some sound in it, and may be thought
worthy the Name and Pains of so great a
Man and zealous a Father of the Church
as your Lordship.</p>
            <p>That I may not be too bold in affirming a
thing I was not privy to, give me leave, my
Lord, to tell your Lordship why I presume
my Book has upon this occasion been look'd
over again, to see what could be found in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65912:9"/>
it capable to bear a deeper Accusation, that
might look like something in a Title-Page.
Your Lordship, by your Station in the Church,
and the Zeal you have shewn in defending
its Articles, could not be supposed, when
you first brought my Book into this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
to have omitted these great Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that it now stands accused of, and to
have cited it for smaller Mistakes, some
whereof were not found, but only ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
to be, in it; if you had then known
these great Faults, which you now charge it
with, to have been in it. If your Lordship
had been apprised of its being guilty of such
dangerous Errors, you would not certainly
have pass'd them by: And therefore I think
one may reasonably conclude, that my <hi>Essay</hi>
was new looked into on purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordship says,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 177.</note> That what you have
done herein you thought it your Duty to do, not
with respect to your Self, but to some of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of our Faith, which you <hi>do not charge</hi> me
with opposing, but by laying such Foundations as do
tend to the overthrow of them. <hi>It cannot be
doubted but</hi> your Duty <hi>would have made you
at the first warn the World, that my</hi> Notions
were inconsistent with the Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, <hi>if your Lordship had then known
it. Though the excessive Respect and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
you express towards me Personally
in the immediately preceding Words, would
be enough utterly to confound me, were I
not a little acquainted with your Lordship's
Civilities in this kind. For you tell me,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 177.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi> these things laid together made your
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65912:10"/>
Lordship think it necessary to do that which
you was <hi>unwilling</hi> to do till I had driven you
to it, which was to shew the Reason you had,
why you looked on my Notion of Ideas and of
Certainty by them, as inconsistent with it self,
and with some important Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith.</p>
            <p>What must I think now, my Lord, of
these Words? Must I take them as a meer
Complement, which is never to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
rigorously, according to the precise
meaning of the Words? Or must I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that your <hi>unwillingness,</hi> to do so hard
a thing to me, restrained your <hi>Duty,</hi> and
you could not prevail on your self (how
much soever the <hi>Mysteries of Faith</hi> were in
danger to be <hi>overthrown)</hi> to get out these
harsh Words, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>my Notions were
inconsistent with the Articles of the Christian
Faith,</hi> till your third Onset, after I had
forced you to <hi>your Duty</hi> by two Replies of
mine?</p>
            <p>It will not become me, my Lord, to
make my self a Complement from your
Words, which you did not intend me in
them. But on the other side, I would not
willingly neglect to acknowledge any Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
from your Lordship in the full extent
of it. The Business is a little nice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
what is contain'd in those two Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 177.</note> cannot by a less skilful Hand than
yours be well put together, though they
immediately follow one another. This, I
am sure, falls out very untowardly, that
your Lordship should <hi>drive</hi> me, (who had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65912:10"/>
much rather have been otherwise imployed)
to <hi>drive</hi> your Lordship to do that which
you were <hi>unwilling</hi> to do. The World
sees how much I was <hi>driven:</hi> For what
Censures, what Imputations must my Book
have lain under, if I had not cleared it
from those Accusations your Lordship
brought against it; when I am charged now
with <hi>Evasions,</hi> for not <hi>clearing</hi> my self from
an Accusation which you never brought
against me? But if it be an <hi>Evasion,</hi> not
to answer to an Objection that has not been
made, what is it I beseech you, my Lord, to
make no reply to Objections that have been
made? Of which I promise to give your
Lordship a List, whenever you shall please
to call for it.</p>
            <p>I forbear it now for fear that if I should say
all that I might upon this new Accusation, it
would be more than would suit with your
Lordship's liking; and you should complain
again that you have <hi>opened a Passage</hi> which
brings <hi>to your mind</hi> Ramazzini <hi>and his Springs
of</hi> Modena. But your Lordship need not <hi>be
afraid of being overwhelmed with the Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
of my Thoughts,</hi> nor much trouble your
self to <hi>find a way to give check to it: Meer
Ebullition of Thoughts never overwhelms</hi> or
sinks any one but the Author himself; but
if it carries Truth with it, that I confess
has force, and it may be troublesome to
those that stand in its way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordship says,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 3.</note> You see how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
it is to give occasion to one of such a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Invention as I am, to write.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:65912:11"/>
I am obliged to your Lordship, that you
think my <hi>Invention</hi> worth concerning your
self about, though it be so unlucky as to
have your Lordship and me always differ
about the measure of its <hi>Fertility.</hi> In your
first Answer<note n="*" place="margin">p. 80.</note> you thought I too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the <hi>Fertility</hi> of my <hi>Invention,</hi> and
ascribed to it what it had no Title to:
And here I think you make the <hi>Fertility of</hi>
my <hi>Invention</hi> greater than it is. For in
what I have answered to your Lordship,
there seems to me no need at all of a <hi>Fertil
Invention.</hi> 'Tis true it has been hard for
me to find out whom you writ against, or
what you meant in many places. As soon
as that was found the Answer lay always
so obvious, and so easie, that there needed
no labour of <hi>Invention</hi> to discover what
one should reply. The Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(where there were any) strip'd of
the Ornaments of Scholastick Language,
and the less obvious ways of learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
seemed to me to carry their Answers
visibly with them. This permit me, my
Lord, to say, That however <hi>fertil</hi> my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi>
is, it has not in all this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
produced one Fiction or wrong Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>But before I leave the Answer you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate,
permit me to observe that I am so
unfortunate to be blamed<note n="*" place="margin">1st Answ. p. 8.</note> for <hi>owning</hi> what
I was not accused to disown; and here for
not <hi>owning</hi> what I was never charged to
disown. The like Misfortune have my
poor Writings. They offend your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65912:11"/>
in some places, because they are <hi>new,</hi>
and in others, because they are not <hi>new.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your next Words which are a new
Charge, I shall pass over till I come to
your Proof of them, and proceed to the
next Paragraph. Your Lordship tells me,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 5.</note>
               <hi>You shall wave all unnecessary Repetitions, and
come immediately to the matter of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
as it is renewed in my Second Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What your Lordship means by <hi>unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Repetitions</hi> here, seems to be of a piece
with your blaming me in the foregoing
Page, for having said too much in my own
defence; and this taken altogether, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
my Opinion, That, in your Thoughts,
it would have been better I should have
replyed nothing at all. For you having set
down here near twenty Lines as a <hi>necessary
Repetition</hi> out of your former Letter, your
Lordship omits my answer to them as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>unnecessary</hi> to be seen; and consequently
you must think was at first <hi>unnecessary</hi> to
have been said. For when the same Words are
<hi>necessary</hi> to be repeated again, if the same
reply which was made to them be not
thought fit to be <hi>repeated</hi> too, it is plainly
judged to be nothing to the purpose, and
should have been spared at first.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, your Lordship has set down
some few Expressions taken out of several
parts of my Reply; but in what manner
the Reader cannot clearly see, without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back to the Original of this Matter.
He must therefore pardon me the trouble
of a deduction, which cannot be avoided,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65912:12"/>
where Controversie is managed at this rate;
which necessitates, and so excuses length of
the Answer.</p>
            <p>My Book was brought into the Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Controversie by these steps. Your
Lordship says, That</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The</hi> Vnitarians<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 231.</note> have not explained the
Nature and Bounds of Reason.</p>
            <p>2. The Author <hi>Of Christianity not My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ibid.</note>
to make amends for this, has offer'd
an account of Reason.</p>
            <p>3. His Doctrin <hi>concerning Reason,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ib. p. 232.</note> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
that we must have clear and distinct Ideas
of whatever we pretend to any Certainty of in
our Mind.</p>
            <p>4. Your Lordship calls this a <hi>new way
of Reasoning.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ib. p 233.</note>
            </p>
            <p>5. This <hi>Gentleman of this new way of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning</hi>
in his First Chapter says something,
which has a conformity with some of the
Notions in my Book. But it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
he speaks them as his own Thoughts
and not upon my Authority, nor with tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any notice of me.</p>
            <p>6. By vertue of this he is presently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
to I know not how much of my
Book;<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 234.</note> and divers Passages of my <hi>Essay</hi> are
quoted, and attributed to him under the
Title of <hi>The Gentlemen of the new way of
Reasoning,</hi> (for he is by this time turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Troop) and certain unknown (if
they are not all contained in this one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
Doublet) <hi>They</hi> and <hi>These</hi> are made
by your Lordship to lay about them
shrewdly for several Pages together in your
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65912:12"/>
Lordship's <hi>Vindication of the Doctrin of the
Trinity,</hi> &amp;c. with Passages taken out of my
Book, which your Lordship was at the pains
to quote as <hi>Theirs, <hi>i. e.</hi>
               </hi> certain unknown
Anti-trinitarians.</p>
            <p>Of this your Lordship's way, strange
and new to me, of dealing with my Book
I took notice.<note n="*" place="margin">1 Letter p. 59.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which your Lordship tells me here</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 5.</note> 
               <hi>you replyed in these following words
which your Lordship has set down as no</hi>
unnecessary Repetition. <hi>Your Words are:</hi>
It was because the Person who opposed the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Christianity went upon my Grounds,
and made use of my Words; although your
Lordship declared withal, That they were used
to other purposes than I intended them; and
your Lordship confessed that the Reason why
you quoted my Words so much, was, because
your Lordship found my Notions as to Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by Ideas, was the main Foundation on which
the Author of <hi>Christianity not Mysterious</hi>
went; and that he had nothing that looked
like Reason if that Principle were removed,
which made your Lordship so much endeavour
to shew, that it would not hold; and so you
supposed the Reason why your Lordship so often
mentioned my Words, was no longer a Riddle
to me. <hi>And to this Repetition your Lordship
subjoins,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 6.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi> I set down these Passages in my
Second Letter, <hi>but with these Words annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<q>That all this seems to me to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the clearing of this Matter.</q>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> I say so indeed in the place quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by your Lordship, and if I had said no
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65912:13"/>
more, your Lordship had done me Justice
in setting down barely these Words as
my Reply, which being set down when
your Lordship was in the way of <hi>Repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
your own Words with no sparing
Hand, as we shall see by and by, these
few of mine set down thus without the
least intimation, that I had said any thing
more, cannot but leave the Reader under
an Opinion, that this was my whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
            <p>But if your Lordship will please to turn
to that place of my Second Letter,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Letter p. 48. &amp;c.</note> out
of which you take these Words, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
you will find that I not only said,
but proved, <q>That what you had said
in the Words above repeated, to clear
the Riddle in your Lordship's way of
writing, did nothing towards it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That which was the Riddle to me, was,
That your Lordship writ against others,
and yet quoted only my Words, and
that you pinn'd my Words, which you
argued against, upon a certain sort of
<hi>These</hi> and <hi>Them</hi> that no where appeared
or were to be found; and by this way
brought my Book into the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this your Lordship says,</hi> You told me
it was because the Person who opposed the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Christianity, went upon my Grounds
and made use of my Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> He that will be at the pains to
compare this, which you call a <hi>Repetition</hi>
here, with the place you quote for it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65912:13"/>
1. <hi>Answ.</hi> p. 46. will, I humbly conceive, find
it a new sort of <hi>Repetition;</hi> unless the setting
down of Words and Expressions not to be
found in it, be the <hi>Repetition</hi> of any Passage.
But for a <hi>Repetition,</hi> let us take it of what
your Lordship had said before.</p>
            <p>The Reason, and the only Reason there
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 46.</note> given why you quoted my Words after
the manner you did, was, <hi>Because you found
my Notions as to Certainty by Ideas, was the
main Foundation which the Author of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
not Mysterious went upon.</hi> These are
the Words in your Lordship's first Letter,
and this the only Reason there given, though
it hath grown a little by <hi>Repetition.</hi> And
to this my Reply<note n="†" place="margin">2 Let. p. 49.</note> was. <q>That I thought
your Lordship had found, that that which
the Author of <hi>Christianity not Mysterious</hi>
went upon, and for which he was made
one of <hi>the Gentlemen of the new way of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,</hi>
opposite to the Doctrin of the
Trinity was, that he made or supposed
<hi>clear and distinct Ideas necessary to Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
But that was not my Notion <hi>as to
Certainty by Ideas,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Which Reply,
my Lord, did not barely <hi>say,</hi> but shew'd
the Reason why I said, That what your
Lordship had offered as the Reason of your
manner of Proceeding, did nothing towards
the clearing of it: Unless it could clear the
Matter to say you joined me with the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of Christianity not Mysterious,</hi> who goes
upon a different Notion of Certainty from
mine; because he goes upon the same with
me. For he (as your Lordship supposes)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65912:14"/>
making Certainty to consist in the perception
of the Agreement or Disagreement of clear
and distinct Ideas; and I on the contrary
making it consist in the perception of the
Agreement of Disagreement of such Ideas
as we have, whether they be perfectly in
all their Parts clear and distinct or no. It
is impossible he should go upon my Grounds,
whilst they are so different, or that his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon my Grounds should be the Reason
of your Lordship's joining me with him.
And now I leave your Lordship to Judge,
how you had <hi>cleared</hi> this Matter, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
what I had answer'd did not prove,
that what you said did nothing towards the
clearing of it?</p>
            <p>This one Thing methinks your Lordship
has made very clear, that you Thought it
necessary to find some way to bring in my
Book, where you were arguing against that
<hi>Author,</hi> that he might be the Person, and
mine the Words you would Argue against
together. But 'tis as clear that the particular
matter which your Lordship made use of to
this purpose, happen'd to be somewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily
chosen. For your Lordship having<note n="†" place="margin">Vindic. p. 232.</note>
Accused him of <hi>supposing clear and distinct
Ideas necessary to Certainty,</hi> which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 14.</note> to be <hi>the Opinion you opposed,</hi> and
for that Opinion having made him a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of a new way of Reasoning,</hi> your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
imagined that was the Notion of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
I went on. But it falling out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and I denying it to be mine, the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
tie between that <hi>Author</hi> and me, was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65912:14"/>
unexpectedly dissolved; and there was no
appearance of Reason for bringing Passages
out of my Book, and arguing against them
as your Lordship did, as if they were that
<hi>Author's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To justifie this, (since my Notion of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
could not be brought to agree with
what he was charged with, as opposite to
<hi>the Doctrin of the Trinity</hi>) he at any rate
must be brought to agree with me, and to
<hi>go upon my Notion of Certainty.</hi> Pardon me
my Lord, that I say at any rate. The
Reason I have to think so, is this. Either
that <hi>Author</hi> does make clear and distinct
Ideas necessary to Certainty, and so does
not go upon my Notion of Certainty: And
then your assigning his going upon my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Certainty, as the Reason for your
joyning us as you did, shews no more but
a willingness in your Lordship to have us
joyn'd. Or he does not <hi>lay all Certainty on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in clear and distinct Ideas,</hi> and so possibly
for ought I know may <hi>go upon my Notion of
Certainty.</hi> But then my Lord, the Reason
of your first bringing him and me into this
Dispute, will appear to have been none.
All your arguing against the <hi>Gentlemen of this
new way of Reasoning,</hi> will be found to be
against no Body, since there is no Body to
be <hi>found</hi> that <hi>lays all Foundation of Certainty
only in clear and distinct Ideas;</hi> no Body to
be <hi>found</hi> that holds the <hi>Opinion</hi> that your
Lordship <hi>opposes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus given you an Account of some
part of my Reply (to what your Lordship
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65912:15"/>
really answer'd in that 46th Page of your
first Letter) to shew that my Reply contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
something more than these Words here
<note n="*" place="margin">.p 6.</note> set down by your Lordship. <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That
all this seems to me to do nothing to the
clearing this Matter.</q> I come now to
those parts of your <hi>Repetition,</hi> as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is pleased to call it, wherein there is
nothing Repeated.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 5.</note> 
               <hi>That you told me</hi>
the Reason why I was brought into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
after the manner I had complained
of, <hi>was because the Person who opposed the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Christianity, went upon my Grounds;</hi>
and for this you quote the 46th Page of your
first Letter. But having turned to that
place, and finding there these Words. <hi>That
you found my Notions as to Certainty by Ideas,
was the main Foundation which that Author
went upon:</hi> Which are far from being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in the Words set down here, unless
<hi>Grounds</hi> in general be the same with <hi>Notions
as to Certainty by Ideas.</hi> I beg leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what you here say as new to me, and
not <hi>Repeated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship says, That you brought
me into the Controversie as you did, <hi>because
that Author went upon my Grounds.</hi> 'Tis possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
he did, or did not: But it cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that he did <hi>go upon my Grounds,</hi> till those
<hi>Grounds</hi> are assigned, and the places both
out of him and me produced to shew, that
we agree in the same <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>go</hi> both
<hi>upon them;</hi> when this is done there will be
room to consider whether it be so or no.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65912:15"/>
In the mean time you having brought me
into the Controversie, for his going upon
this particular Ground, supposed to be
mine, <hi>That clear and distinct Ideas are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Certainty.</hi> It can do nothing towards
the clearing this, to say in general, as your
Lordship does,<note n="*" place="margin">pag. 6.</note> 
               <hi>That he went upon my
Grounds,</hi> because though he should agree
with me in several other Things, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from me in this one <hi>Notion of Certainty,</hi>
there could be no reason for your dealing
with me as you have done. That <hi>Notion of
Certainty,</hi> being your very exception against
his <hi>Account of Reason;</hi> and the sole occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
you took of bringing in Passages out of
my Book; and the very Foundation of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
against them.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship farther says here,<note n="*" place="margin">pag 6.</note> in this
<hi>Repetition</hi> which you did not say before in
the place refer'd to as <hi>Repeated, That he made
use of my Words.</hi> I think he did of Words
something like mine. But as I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
also, <hi>he made use of them,</hi> as his own,
and not <hi>as my Words;</hi> for I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that he quotes me for them. This I am
sure, That in the Words quoted out of
him by your Lordship, upon which my
Book is brought in, there is not one Syllable
of <hi>Certainty by Ideas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt whatever he or I or any one
have said, if your Lordship disapproves of
it, you have a right to Question him that
said it. But I do not see how this gives
your Lordship any Right to entitle any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to what he does not say, whoever else
says it.

The Author of <hi>Christianity not Mysterious,</hi>
says in his Book something suitable to what
I had said in mine; borrowed or not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from mine, I leave your Lordship
to determine for him. But I doe not see
what ground that gives your Lordship to
concern me in the Controversie you have
with him, for things I say which he does
not; and which I say to a different pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
from his. Let that <hi>Author</hi> and I agree
in this one <hi>Notion of Certainty</hi> as much as
you please, what Reason I beseech your
Lordship could this be, to quote my Words
as his, who never used them; and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
as you say more than once, to which
I never intended them? This was that which
I complained was a Riddle to me. And
since your Lordship can give no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it, than those we have hitherto seen,
I think it is sufficiently unridled, and you
are in the right when you say, <hi>you think it
is no longer a Riddle to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I easily grant my little Reading may not
have instructed me, what has been, or what
may be done, in the several ways of writing
and managing of Controversie, which like
War always produces new Stratagems:
Only I beg my Ignorance may be my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
for saying, that this appears a new
way of writing to me, and this is the first
time I ever met with it.</p>
            <p>But let the ten Lines which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
has set down out of him<note n="*" place="margin">Vindic. p. 234.</note> be if you
please, supposed to be precisely my Words,
and that he quoted my Book for them. I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65912:20"/>
not see how even this entitles him to any
more of my Book than he has quoted. Or
how any Words of mine in other parts of
my Book, can be ascribed to him, or argued
against as his, or rather, as I know not
whose, which was the Thing I complained
of; for the <hi>These</hi> and <hi>They,</hi> those Passages
of my Book were ascribed to, could not be
that Author, for he used them not: Nor the
Author of <hi>The Essay of Humane Vnderstanding</hi>
for he was not argued against, but was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
from the Controversie under De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.
So that neither he nor I being the
<hi>They</hi> and <hi>Those,</hi> that so often occur, and
deserved so much Pains from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
I could not but complain of this to
me incomprehensible way of bringing my
Book into that Controversie.</p>
            <p>Another part of your Lordship's <hi>Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 6.</note> which I humbly conceive, is no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition;</hi>
because this also I find not in that
Passage quoted for it, is this, That your
Lordship <hi>confessed that the Reason why you
quoted my Words so much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, I do not remember any need
your Lordship had to give <hi>a Reason why
you quoted my Words so much,</hi> because I do
not remember, that I made that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of my Complaint. That which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of, was not the quantity of what
was quoted out of my Book, but the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of quoting it,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Let. p. 49.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That I was so
every where joined with others, under
the comprehensive words <hi>They</hi> and <hi>Them,</hi>
though my Book alone were every where
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65912:21"/>
quoted, that the World would be apt
to think, I was the Person who argued
against the Trinity:</q> And again,<note n="†" place="margin">ib. p. 51.</note> 
               <q>That
which I complained of, was, That I was
made one of <hi>the Gentlemen of the new way
of Reasoning,</hi> without being guilty of
what made them so, and so was brought
into a Chapter wherein I thought my
self not concerned; which was manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so, that my Book was all along quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and others argued against; others
were entitled to what I said, and I to
what others said, without knowing why
or how:</q> Nay, I told your Lordship
in that very Reply,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Let. p. 50</note> 
               <q>That if your
Lordship had <hi>directly</hi> questioned any of
my Opinions, I should not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</q>
Thus your Lordship sees my
Complaint was not of the largeness, but
of the manner of your Quotations. But
of that in all these many Pages imployed
by your Lordship for my <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> you,
as I remember, have not been pleased to
offer any reason, nor can I hither to find it
any way <hi>cleared:</hi> When I do, I shall
readily acknowledge your great Mastery
in this as in all other ways of writing.</p>
            <p>I have in the foregoing Pages, for the
clearing this Matter, been obliged to take
notice of <hi>Them</hi> and <hi>Those,</hi> as directly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
no body. Whether your Lordship
will excuse me for so doing I know not,
since I perceive such slight words as <hi>Them</hi>
and <hi>Those</hi> are not to be minded in your
Lordship's Writings: Your Lordship has
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65912:21"/>
a priviledge to use such trifling <hi>Particles</hi>
without taking any great care what or whom
they refer to.</p>
            <p>To shew the Reader that I do not talk
without Book in the Case, I shall set down
your Lordship's own Words,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 90.</note> 
               <hi>What a
hard fate doth that Man lie under, that falls
into the Hands of a severe Critick! He must
have a care of his</hi> But, <hi>and For, and Them,
and It. For the least ambiguity in any of
these, will fill up Pages in an Answer, and
make a Book look considerable for the bulk of
it. And what must a Man do, who is to
answer all such Objections about the use of
Particles?</hi> I humbly conceive 'tis not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reason, that your Lordship here claims
an exemption from having a care of your
<hi>But,</hi> and your <hi>For,</hi> and your <hi>Them,</hi> and
other <hi>Particles.</hi> The sequel of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will shew, That 'tis a priviledge your
Lordship makes great use of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have reason to be tender of it, and to
cry out against those unmannerly <hi>Criticks,</hi>
who question it. Upon this consideration,
I cannot but look on it as a misfortune to
me, that it should fall in my way to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
your Lordship, by disturbing you
in the quiet, and perhaps antient Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of so convenient a Priviledge. But
how great soever the advantages of it may
be to a Writer, I upon experience find it
is very troublesome and perplexing to a
Reader, who is concern'd to understand what
is written, that he may answer to it. But
to return to the place we were upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:65912:22"/>
Your Lordship goes on and says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it doth or no,</hi> i. e. Whether what your
Lordship had said does clear this Matter
or no, <hi>you are content to leave it to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Reader; and there it must rest at last
although I should write Volumes about it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the reading of these last Words
of your Lordship's, I thought you had quite
done with this <hi>personal Matter,</hi> so apt, as
you say, <hi>to weary the World.</hi> But whether
it be that your Lordship is not much sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in the handling of it, or in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it alone; whether your Lordship
meant by these last words, that what I
write about it is <hi>Volumes,</hi> i. e. too much,
as your Lordship has told me in the first
Page; but what your Lordship says about
it is but necessary; whether these or any
other be the cause of it, <hi>Personal Matter,</hi>
as it seems, is very importunate, and
troublesome to your Lordship, as it is to
the World: You turn it going in the end
of one Paragraph, and <hi>personal Matter</hi>
thrusts it self in again in the beginning of
the next, whether of it self, without your
Lordship's notice or consent, I examine
not. But thus stand the immediate fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words wherein you Lordship asks
me,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 6.</note> 
               <hi>But for what cause do I continue so
unsatisfied?</hi> To which you make me give
this answer, <hi>That <hi>the cause why I continue
so unsatisfied, is, That the Author men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
went upon this Ground, That clear
and distinct Ideas are necessary to Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but that is not my Notion as to Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65912:22"/>
by Ideas; which is, That Certainty
consists in the perception of the agreement
or disagreement of Ideas, such as we have,
whether they be in all their parts perfectly
clear and distinct or no; and that I have
no Notions of Certainty more than this
one.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Words which your Lordship has
set down for mine, I have printed in a
distinct Character, that the Reader may
take particular notice of them; not that
there is any thing very remarkable in this
Passage it self, but because it makes the
business of the Fourscore following Pages.
For the <hi>three several Answers</hi> that your
Lordship says you have <hi>given to it,</hi> and that
which you call your <hi>Defence</hi> of them, reach,
as I take it, to the 87 Page. But another
particular Reason why this Answer which
your Lordship has made for me to a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of your own putting, is distinguished
by a particular Character, is to save fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Repetitions of it, that the Reader
by having recourse to it, may see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
those things, which your Lordship says
of it, be so or no, and judge whether I am
in the wrong, when I assure him, that I
cannot find them to be as you say.</p>
            <p>Only before I come to what your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
positively says of this which you call
my <hi>Answer,</hi> I crave leave to observe that
it supposes I <hi>continue unsatisfied:</hi> To which
I reply, That I no where say that I <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
unsatisfied:</hi> I may say, That what is
offer'd for Satisfaction, gives none to me
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65912:23"/>
or any body else; and yet I as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
People, may be satisfied concerning
the matter.</p>
            <p>I now come to what your Lordship says
positively of it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>You say that <hi>I tell you, That</hi>
               </hi> the cause
why I continued unsatisfied, is, That the
Author mentioned, went upon this Ground,
That clear and distinct Ideas are necessary
to Certainty; but that is not my Notion
of Certainty by Ideas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I crave leave to reply, That
neither in the 50th Page of my Second
Letter which your Lordship quotes for
it, nor any where else did I tell your
Lordship any such thing. Neither could
I assign, <hi>That Authors going upon that Ground,</hi>
there mentioned as any cause of dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to me, because I know not <hi>that he
went upon this Ground, That clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Ideas are necessary to Certainty;</hi> for I
have met with nothing produced by your
Lordship out of him, to prove that he did
so. And if it be true, that he <hi>goes upon
Grounds of Certainty</hi> that are not mine, I
know no Body that ought to be <hi>dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
with it but your Lordship, who have
taken so much pains to make his Grounds
mine, and my Grounds his, and to entitle
us both to what each has said apart.</p>
            <p>2. Your Lordship says, <hi>This <hi>is no more
than what I had said before in my former Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Answ.</hi>
               </hi> For this I appeal to the 57th, or
rather (as I think you writ) 87th page quoted
for it by your Lordship; where any one
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65912:23"/>
must have very good Eyes, to find all that is
set down here in <hi> this Answer,</hi> (as you a
little lower call it) which you have been
pleased to put into my Mouth. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the one nor the other of those Pages,
is there any such <hi>Answer</hi> of mine. Indeed,
in the 87th Page there are these Words,
<q>That Certainty, in my Opinion, lies in
the perception of the agreement or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
of Ideas, such as they are,
and not always in having perfectly clear
and distinct Ideas.</q> But these Words
there, are not given as Answer to this
Question, <hi>Why do I continue so unsatisfied?</hi>
And the remarkable Answer above set
down, is as I take it, more than these
Words, as much more in proportion as
your Lordship's whole Letter is, more than
the half of it.</p>
            <p>3. Your Lordship says of the remarkable
Answer above set down, That <hi>you took par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
notice of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I crave leave to reply, That
your Lordship no where before took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of <hi>this Answer,</hi> as you call it: For it
was no where before extant, though it be
true, some part of the Words of it were.
But some part of the Words of <hi>this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi>
(which too were never given as an
Answer to the Question propos'd) can
never be <hi>this Answer,</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>4. Your Lordship farther says, That <hi>you
gave three several Answers to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:65912:24"/>
To which I must crave leave further to
reply, That never an one of the <hi>three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers</hi>
which you here say you gave to <hi>this</hi>
my <hi>Answer,</hi> were given to <hi>this Answer</hi>
which in the Words above set down, you
made me give to your Question, Why <hi>I
continued so unsatisfied?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To justifie this my Reply, there needs
no more but to set down these your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
<hi>three Answers,</hi> and to turn to the
places where you say <hi>you gave</hi> them.</p>
            <p>The first of your three Answers is this,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 7.</note> 
               <hi>That those who offer at clear and distinct
Ideas, bid much fairer for Certainty than I
do, (according to this Answer) and speak more
agreeably to my original Grounds of Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
The place you quote for this, is 1 <hi>Ans.</hi>
p. 80. but in that place it is not given as
an <hi>Answer</hi> to my saying, That <hi>the cause
why I continue unsatisfied, is, That the
Author mentioned, went upon this Ground,
That clear and distinct Ideas are necessary
to Certainty, but,</hi> &amp;c. And if it be given for
Answer to it here, it seems a very strange
one. For I am supposed to say, That <hi>the
cause why I continue unsatisfied, is, That
the Author mentioned, went upon a Ground</hi>
different from mine; and to satisfie me I am
told, his way is better than mine, which
cannot but be thought an Answer very likely
to satisfie me.</p>
            <p>Your second Answer, which you say <hi>you
gave</hi> to that remarkable Passage above set
down is this,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 15.</note> 
               <hi>That it is very possible the
Author of</hi> Christianity not Mysterious, <hi>might
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65912:24"/>
mistake or misapply my Notions; but there is
too much reason to believe he thought them the
same, and we have no reason to be sorry that
he hath given me this occasion for the explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my meaning, and for the Vindication of
my self in the matters I apprehend he had
charged me with;</hi> and for this you quote
your first Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 36. But neither are
these Words in that place an Answer to
my saying, That the cause why I continued
dissatisfied, is, That that Author went up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Ground, That clear and distinct I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
are necessary to certainty, but, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Your third Answer, which you say you
gave to that Passage above set down, is,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 20.</note> 
               <hi>That my own Grounds of Certainty tend to
Scepticism; and that in an Age wherein the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Faith are too much exposed by the
Promoters of Scepticism and Infidelity, it is a
thing of dangerous consequence to start such
new methods of Certainty, as are apt to leave
Mens Minds more doubtful than before:</hi> For
this you refer the Reader to your first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.<note n="†" place="margin">p. 36.</note>
But I must crave leave also to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
That these Words are not all to
be found in that place; and those of them
which are there, are by no means an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi>
to my saying, That <hi>the cause why I
continue unsatisfied, is,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What the Words which your Lordship
has here set down as your <hi>three Answers,</hi>
are brought in for in those three places
quoted by your Lordship, any one that will
consult them may see, it would hold me
too long in <hi>Personal Matter</hi> to explain that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65912:25"/>
here; and therefore for your Lordship's
satisfaction I pass by those particulars. But
this I crave leave to be positive in, That
in neither of them, they are <hi>given</hi> in reply
to that, which is above set down, as my
Answer to your Lordship's Question, <hi>For
what cause do I continue so unsatisfied?</hi> Tho'
your Lordship here says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 7.</note> That to <hi>This
Answer</hi> they were given as a Reply, and
it was it you had <hi>taken notice of,</hi> and <hi>given</hi>
these <hi>three several</hi> Replies to. As <hi>Answers</hi>
therefore to what you make me say here,
<hi>viz. That the cause of my continuing unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
is, That the Author mentioned, went up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Ground of Certainty that is none of mine;</hi>
I cannot consider them. For to this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them is given as an Answer, tho'
<hi>this</hi> and it in ordinary construction, make
them have that reference. But these are
some of your priviledged <hi>Particles,</hi> and
may be applied how and to what you
please.</p>
            <p>But though neither of these Passages be
any manner of Answer to what your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
calls them <hi>Answers</hi> to, yet your lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such stress on them, that well nigh
half your Letter, as I take it, is spent in
the defence of them; 'tis fit I consider
what you say under each of them.</p>
            <p>I say, <hi>as I take it,</hi> near half your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is in defence of these three Passages.</p>
            <p>One reason why I speak so doubtfully,
is, that though you say here,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 7.</note> That <hi>you
will lay them together and defend them,</hi> and
that in effect all that is said to the 87th
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65912:25"/>
Page is ranged under these three Heads; yet
they being brought in as <hi>Answers</hi> to what I
am made to say is <hi>the cause why I continued
unsatisfied;</hi> I should scarce think your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
should spend so many Pages in this <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Matter,</hi> after you had but two or three
Pages before so openly blamed me for spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a less number of Pages in my Answer
concerning <hi>Personal Matters,</hi> what your
Lordship had in your Letter concerning
them.</p>
            <p>Another reason why I speak so doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
is because I do not see how these
three Passages need so long or any <hi>Defences</hi>
where they are not attacked; or if they be
attacked, methinks the <hi>Defences</hi> of them
should have been applied to the Answers I
had made to them; or if I have made
none, and they be of such moment that
they require Answers, your Lordship's
minding me that they did so, would either
by my continued silence have left to your
Lordship all that you can pretend to for
my granting them, or else my Answers to
them have given your Lordship an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to <hi>defend</hi> them, and perhaps to have
defended them otherwise than you have
done. This is certain, that these defences
had come time enough when they had been
attack'd, and then it would have been seen
whether what was said, did defend them
or no. The truth is, my Lord, if you
will give me leave to speak my Thoughts
freely, when I consider these <hi>three,</hi> as you
call them, <hi>Answers,</hi> how they themselves
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65912:26"/>
are brought in, and what Relation that which
is brought under each of them has to them,
and to the Matter in Question; methinks
they look rather like Texts chosen to be
discoursed on, than as Answers to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended</hi>
in a Controversie. For the connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that which in Train is tacked on to
them, is such that makes me see I am wholly
mistaken in what I thought the established
rule of Controversie. This was also another
Reason why I said you spent, <hi>as I take it,</hi> near
half of your Letter in defence of them.
For when I consider how one thing hangs
on to another, under the 3d <hi>Answer,</hi> from
Page 20, where it is brought in to p. 87.
where I think that which you call your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
it ends, 'tis a hard matter by the
relation and dependency of the parts of
that Discourse (contained in those Pages)
one on another, to tell where it ends.</p>
            <p>But to consider the Passages themselves,
and the Defense of them.</p>
            <p>That which you call your <hi>first Answer,</hi> and
which you say you will <hi>defend,</hi> is in these
Words,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Those who offer at clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Ideas, bid much fairer for Certainty than
I do, (according to</hi> this Answer) <hi>and speak more
agreeably to my original Grounds of Certainty.</hi>
These Words being brought in at first as a
reply to what was called <hi>my Answer,</hi> but
was not my <hi>Answer,</hi> as may be seen, <hi>Lett.</hi> 1.
p. 87. I took no notice of them in my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Letter, as being nothing at all to the
Point in Hand, and therefore what need
they have of a farther <hi>defence,</hi> when nothing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65912:26"/>
is objected to them, I do not see. To what
purpose is it to spend seven or eight Pages
to shew, that anothers Notion about Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
is better than mine; when that
tends not to shew how your saying, <hi>That
the Certainty of my proof of a God, is not placed
upon any clear and distinct Ideas, but upon the
force of Reason distinct from it,</hi> concerns me,
which was the thing there to be shewn; as
is visible to any one who will vouchsafe to
look into that 87th Page of my first Letter.
And indeed, why should your Lordship
trouble your self to prove, which of
Two different ways of Certainty by Ideas
is the best, when you have so ill an
Opinion of the whole way of Certainty by
Ideas, that you accuse it of tendency to
<hi>Scepticism?</hi> But it seems your Lordship is
resolved to have all the Faults in my Book
clear'd or corrected, and so you go on to
<hi>defend</hi> these Words. <hi>That those who offer
at clear and distinct Ideas, bid much fairer for
Certainty than I do.</hi> I could have wished that
your Lordship had pleased a little to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
them, before you had defended them;
for they are not, to me, without some Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity.
However, to guess as well as I can, I
think the Proposition that you intend here, is
this, That those who place Certainty in the
perception of the agreement or Disagreement
of only clear and distinct Ideas, are more in
the right than I am, who place it in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the agreement or disagreement of
Ideas, such as we have though they be not in
all their parts perfectly clear and distinct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:65912:27"/>
Whether your Lordship has proved this,
or no, will be seen when we come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what you have said in the <hi>defence</hi> of
it. In the mean time, I have no reason
to be sorry, to hear your Lordship say so;
because this supposes, That Certainty can
be attained by the perception of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or disagreement of clear and distinct
Ideas. For if Certainty cannot be attained
by the perception of the agreement or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
of clear and distinct Ideas: How
can they be more in the right, who place
Certainty in one sort of Ideas, that it cannot
be had in; than those who place it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sort of Ideas, that it cannot be had in?</p>
            <p>I shall proceed now to examine what your
Lordship has said in defence of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
you have here set down, to <hi>defend:</hi>
which, you may be sure I shall do, with all
the favourableness that Truth will allow,
since if your Lordship makes it out to be
true, it puts an end to the Dispute you
have had with me. For it confutes that
main Proposition, which you have so
much contended for, <hi>That to lay all Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Certainty, as to matters of Faith, upon
clear and distinct Ideas, does certainly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all Mysteries of Faith:</hi> Unless you
will say, that Mysteries of Faith cannot
consist with what you have proved to be
true.</p>
            <p>To prove that they are more in the right
than I, who place Certainty in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the agreement or disagreement
of clear and distinct Ideas only, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65912:27"/>
says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 7.</note> 
               <hi>That it is a wonderful thing, in
point of Reason, for me to pretend to Certainty
by Ideas, and not allow these Ideas to be clear and
distinct.</hi> This my Lord looks as if I placed
Certainty only in obscure and confused Ideas,
and did not <hi>allow</hi> it might be had by clear
and distinct ones. But I have declared my
self so clearly and so fully to the contrary,
that I doubt not, but your Lordship would
think I deserved to be ask'd, whether <hi>this
were fair and ingenuous dealing, to represent
this matter,</hi> as this Expression does: But
the instances are so many, how apt my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
way of Writing is to mislead your
Lordship, and that always on the side least
favourable to my Sense, that if I should cry
out as often as I think I meet with occasion
for it; your Lordship would have reason
to be uneasie at the <hi>Ebullition</hi> and <hi>Inlarging</hi>
of my Complaints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordship farther asks,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 7 and 8.</note> How can
I clearly perceive the agreement or disagreement
of Ideas, if I have not clear and distinct Ideas?
For how is it possible for a Mans Mind to know
whether they agree or disagree, if there be some
parts of those Ideas, we have only general and
confused Ideas of. <hi>I would rather Read these
later Words, if your Lordship please</hi> if there
be some parts of those Ideas <hi>that are</hi> only gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and confused, <hi>for</hi> parts of Ideas that we
have only general and confused Ideas of, <hi>is not
very clear and intelligible to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Taking then your Lordship's Question
as cleared of this Obscurity, it will stand
thus. <hi>How is it possible for a Man's Mind
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65912:28"/>
to know, whether Ideas agree or disagree, if
there be some parts of those Ideas obscure and
confused?</hi> In answer to which, I crave leave
to ask. <hi>Is it possible for a Man's Mind to
perceive, whether Ideas agree or disagree, if
no parts of those Ideas be obscure and confused,</hi>
and by that Perception to attain Certainty?
If your Lordship says, No. How do you
hereby prove, that they who place Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
in the perception of the agreement
or disagreement of only clear and distinct
Ideas, are more in the right than I? For
they who place Certainty, where it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be had, can in that be no more
in the right, than he who places it in any
other impossibility. If you say, Yes, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
may be attained by the perception of
the agreement or disagreement of clear and
distinct Ideas, you give up the main Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion:
You grant the Proposition, which
you declare you chiefly oppose; and so all
this great Dispute with me is at an end. Your
Lordship may take which of these Two
you please, if the former, the Proposition
here to be proved, is given up, if the latter,
the whole Controversie is given up, one of
them 'tis plain you must say.</p>
            <p>This and what your Lordship says far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on this Point, seems to me, to prove
nothing, but that you suppose, that either
there are no such thing as obscure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Ideas; and then, with submission,
the distinction between clear and obscure,
distinct and confused is useless, and 'tis in
vain to talk of clear and obscure, distinct
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65912:28"/>
and confused Ideas, in opposition to one
another: Or else your Lordship supposes,
that an obscure and confused Idea, is wholly
undistinguishable from all other Ideas, and
so in effect is all other Ideas: For if an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and confused Idea, be not one and the
same with all other Ideas, as it is impossible
for it to be, then the obscure and confused
Idea may and will be so far different from
some other Ideas, that it may be perceived
whether it agrees or disagrees with them
or no. For every Idea in the Mind, clear
or obscure, distinct or confused, is but that
one Idea, that it is, and not another Idea,
that it is not; and the Mind perceives it
to be the Idea, that it is, and not another
Idea that it is different from.</p>
            <p>What therefore I mean by obscure and
confused Ideas, I have at large shewn<note n="*" place="margin">Essay B. 2. C. 29.</note>
and shall not trouble your Lordship with a
Repetition of here. For that there are
such obscure and confused Ideas, I suppose
the instances your Lordship gives here<note n="†" place="margin">p. 24.</note>
Evince; to which I shall add this one
more. Suppose you should in the Twilight,
or in a thick Mist, see two Things standing
upright, near the size and shape of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Man; but in so dim a Light, or at
such a distance, that they appeared very
much alike, and you could not perceive them
to be what they really were, the one a
Statue, the other a Man, would not these
Two be obscure and confused Ideas? And
yet could not your Lordship be certain of
the Truth of this Proposition concerning
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65912:29"/>
either of them, that it was something, or
did exist, and that by perceiving the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that Idea (as obscure and confused
as it was) with that of Existence as exprest
in that Proposition?</p>
            <p>This my Lord, is just the case of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
upon which you raised this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
concerning obscure and confused
Ideas; which this instance shews may have
Propositions made about them, of whose
Truth we may be certain.</p>
            <p>Hence I crave liberty to conclude, That
I am nearer the Truth than those who say,
That <hi>Certainty is founded only in clear and
distinct Ideas,</hi> if any Body does say so. For
no such Saying of any one of those, with
whom your Lordship joined me, for so say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is, that I remember, yet produced;
though this be that for which <hi>They</hi> and
<hi>Those,</hi> whoever they be, had from your
Lordship<note n="†" place="margin">Vindic. p. 233. 234.</note> the Title of the <hi>Gentlemen of the
new way of Reasoning:</hi> And this be the <hi>Opinion</hi>
which your Lordship declares<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 14.</note> you <hi>Oppose,</hi>
as <hi>certainly overthrowing all Mysteries of Faith,
and excluding the Notion of Substance out of
rational Discourse;</hi> which terrible Tarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Proposition, <hi>viz. That Certainty is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only in clear and distinct Ideas,</hi> which
has made such a Noise, and been the cause
of the <hi>spending</hi> above Ten times <hi>Fifty Pages,</hi>
and given occasion to very large <hi>Ebullition
of Thoughts;</hi> appears not by any thing that
has been yet produced, to be any where in
their Writings, with whom upon this Score
you have had so warm a Controversie, but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65912:29"/>
only in your Lordship's Imagination, and
what you have at least for this once, <hi>writ
out of your own Thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this Paragraph contain so little in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi>
of the Proposition, which your Lordship
in the beginning of it, set down on purpose
to <hi>defend;</hi> what follows is visibly more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from it. But since your Lordship
has been pleased to tack it on here, though
without applying of it any way, that I see,
to the <hi>defence</hi> of the Proposition to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,</hi>
which is already got clean out of
Sight, I am taught, that 'tis fit I consider
it here in this, which your Lordship has
thought the <hi>proper place</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>In the next Paragraph,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 9.</note> your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is pleased to take notice of this part
of my Complaint, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>I say more than
twice or ten times,</hi> 
               <q>That you blame those
who place Certainty in clear and distinct
Ideas; but I do not, and yet you bring
me in amongst them.</q> And for this, your
Lordship quotes Seventeen several Pages of
my second Letter. Whoever will give
himself the trouble to turn to those Pages,
will see how far I am in those places, from
barely saying, <hi>That you blame those who place
Certainty,</hi> &amp;c. And what reason you had
to point to so many Places for my so saying,
as a repetition of my Complaint. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they will find the Proposition about
<hi>placing Certainty only in clear and distinct Ideas,</hi>
is mentioned in them upon several occasions,
and to different purposes as the Argument
required.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:65912:30"/>
Be that as it will, this is a part of my
<hi>Complaint,</hi> and you do me a Favour, that
after having, as you say, met with it in so
many Places, you are pleased at last to take
notice of it, and promise me <hi>a full answer to
it.</hi> The first part of which <hi>full answer,</hi> is
in these Words<note n="*" place="margin">pag. 9.</note> That <hi>you do not deny but the
first occasion of your Lordship's Charge, was
in the Supposition, that clear and distinct Ideas
were necessary, in order to any Certainty in our
Minds.</hi> 
               <q>And that the only way to attain
this Certainty, was by comparing <hi>these</hi>
Ideas together.</q>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, though I have faithfully set
down these Words out of your 2d Answer,
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 9.</note> yet I must own I have Printed them in
something a different Character from that
which they stand in your Letter. For your
Lordship has published this Sentence so,
as if <hi>the supposition that clear and distinct Ideas,
were necessary in order to any Certainty in our
Minds,</hi> were my <hi>Supposition;</hi> whereas I must
crave Leave to let my Reader know, That
that <hi>Supposition</hi> is purely your Lordship's, for
you neither in <hi>your Defence of the Trinity,</hi>
nor in your <hi>first Answer,</hi> produce any thing
to prove, That that was either an Assertion
or <hi>Supposition</hi> of mine: But your Lordship
was pleased to suppose it for me. As to the
latter Words, <q>and that the only way to
attain this Certainty, was by comparing
<hi>these</hi> Ideas together.</q> If your Lordship
means by <hi>these <hi>Ideas,</hi>
               </hi> Ideas in general; then
I acknowledge these to be my Words, or
to my Sense; but then they are not any <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:65912:30"/>
in my Book, though they are made
part of the <hi>Supposition</hi> here; but their Sense
is expressed in my <hi>Essay</hi> at large in more
places than one. But if by <hi>these <hi>Ideas,</hi>
               </hi> your
Lordship means only clear and distinct Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
I crave leave to deny, that to be my
Sense or any <hi>Supposition</hi> of mine.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship goes on,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 9.</note> 
               <hi>But to prove
<hi>this.</hi>
               </hi> Prove what, I beseech you my Lord?
That Certainty was to be attained by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
Ideas, was a Supposition of mine?
To prove that there needed no <hi>Words</hi> or
<hi>Principles</hi> of mine to be <hi>produced,</hi> unless
your Lordship would prove that which was
never denied.</p>
            <p>But if it were to prove <hi>this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </hi> That
it was a <hi>Supposition</hi> of mine, That <hi>clear and
distinct Ideas were necessary to Certainty,</hi> and
that to <hi>prove</hi> this to be a <hi>Supposition</hi> of mine,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 9.</note> 
               <hi>My Words were produced, and my Principles
of Certainty laid down and none else;</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
I do not remember any <hi>Words</hi> or
<hi>Principles</hi> of mine <hi>produced</hi> to shew any
ground for such a <hi>Supposition,</hi> that I placed
Certainty only in clear and distinct Ideas;
and if there had been any such <hi>produced,</hi>
your Lordship would have done Me and
the Reader a favour, to have marked the
Pages wherein one might have found them
<hi>produced,</hi> unless your Lordship thinks you
make amends for quoting so many Pages
of my second Letter, which might have
been spared, by neglecting wholly to quote
any of your own where it needed. When
your Lordship shall please to direct me to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65912:31"/>
those places where such <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of mine were <hi>produced</hi> to prove such
a <hi>Supposition,</hi> I shall readily turn to them,
to see how far they do really give ground
for it. But my bad Memory not suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to me any thing like it, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
I hope, will pardon me if I do not
turn over your <hi>Defence of the Trinity</hi> and
your <hi>First Letter,</hi> to see whether you have
any such <hi>Proofs</hi> which you your self seem
so much to doubt or think so meanly of,
that you do not so much as point out the
places where they are to be found; though
we have in this very Page so eminent an
Example, that you are not sparing of your
Pains in this kind, where you have the
least thought that it might serve your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to the meanest purpose.</p>
            <p>But though you <hi>produced</hi> no <hi>Words</hi> or
<hi>Principles</hi> of mine to <hi>prove</hi> this a <hi>Supposition</hi>
of mine, yet in your next Words, here
your Lordship <hi>produces</hi> a Reason why you
your self supposed it. For you say,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 9.</note> 
               <hi>You
could not imagine that I could place Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the agreement or disagreement of Ideas,
and not suppose those Ideas to be clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct;</hi>
so that at last the Satisfaction you
give me, why my Book was brought into
a Controversie, wherein it was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
is that your Lordship <hi>imagined</hi> I
<hi>supposed</hi> in it, what I did not <hi>suppose</hi> in it.
And here I crave leave to ask, Whether
the Reader may not well suppose that you
had a great mind to bring my Book into
that Controversie, when the only handle
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65912:31"/>
you could find for it, was an imagination
of a <hi>Supposition</hi> to be in it, which in truth
was not there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordship adds,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 9.</note> That I finding my
self joined in such Company which I did not
desire to be seen in, I rather chose to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
my self from them, by denying clear
and distinct Ideas to be necessary to Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>If it might be permitted to another to
guess at your Thoughts, as well as you do
at mine, he perhaps would turn it thus,
That your Lordship finding no readier way,
as you thought, to set a mark upon my
Book, than by bringing several Passages of
it into a Controversie concerning the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
wherein they had nothing to do; and
speaking of them under the name of <hi>Those</hi>
and <hi>Them,</hi> as if your Adversaries in that
Dispute had made use of those Passages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Trinity, when no one Opposer
of the Doctrin of the Trinity, that I know,
or that you have produced, ever made use
of one of them; you thought fit to jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
my Book with other Peoples Opinions
after a new way never used by any other
writer that I ever heard of. If any one
will consider what your Lordship has said
for my <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> (wherein you have, as
I humbly conceive I have shewn, produced
nothing but Imaginations of Imaginations,
and Suppositions of Suppositions) he will,
I conclude, without straining of his
Thoughts, be carried to this Conjecture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:65912:32"/>
But Conjectures apart, your Lordship
says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 9.</note> 
               <hi>That I finding my self joined in such
Company which I did not desire to be seen in,
I rather chose to distinguish my self.</hi> If keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my Book can be called <hi>distinguishing
my self.</hi> You say, I <hi>rather chose. Rather!</hi>
than what, my Lord, I beseech you? Your
learned way of Writing, I find is every
where beyond my Capacity; and unless I
will guess at your meaning (which is not
very safe) beyond what I can certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by your Words, I often know not
what to answer to. 'Tis certain, you mean
here, that I prefer'd <hi>distinguishing my self
from them I found my self joined with</hi> to
something; but to what you do not say. If
you mean to owning that for my Notion
of Certainty, which is not my Notion of
Certainty; this is true, I did and shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<hi>
                  <hi>rather choose to distinguish my self from
any</hi> them,</hi> than own that for my Notion
which is not my Notion: If you mean that
I prefer'd <hi>my distinguishing my self from them
to my being joined with them,</hi> you make me
<hi>choose</hi> where there neither is nor can be any
Choice. For what is wholly out of one's
Power, leaves no room for Choice: And
I think, I should be laughed at, if I should
say, I <hi>rather choose to distinguish my self</hi> from
the Papists, than that it should Rain. For
it is no more in my Choice not to be joined,
as your Lordship has been pleased to join
me, with the unknown <hi>They</hi> and <hi>Them,</hi>
than it is in my Power that it should not
Rain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:65912:32"/>
'Tis like you will say here again, this is
a <hi>nice Criticism;</hi> I grant, my Lord, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Words and Expressions: But since I
cannot know your meaning but by your
Words and Expressions, if this defect in
my Understanding very frequently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
me in your Writings to and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me, 'tis troublesome, I confess; but
what must I do? Must I play at blind
Man's-buff? Catch at what I do not see?
Answer to I know not what; to no mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>i. e.</hi> to nothing? Or must I presume
to know your meaning when I do not?</p>
            <p>For Example, suppose I should presume
it to be your meaning here, That <hi>I found
my self joined in Company</hi> by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
with the Author of <hi>Christianity not
Mysterious,</hi> by your Lordship's imputing the
same Notions of Certainty to us both; That
<hi>I did not desire to be seen in his Company,</hi> i. e.
to be thought to be of his Opinion in other
things: And therefore <hi>I choose rather to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
my self from him, by denying clear
and distinct Ideas to be necessary to Certainty,
than to be so joined with him.</hi> If I should
presume this to be the Sense of these your
Words here, and that by the doubtful sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the Expression of being <hi>joined
in Company</hi> and <hi>seen in Comany,</hi> used equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally,
your Lordship should mean,
that because I was said to be of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in one thing, I was to be thought to
be of his Opinion in all things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
disowned to be of his Opinion in
that, wherein I was of his Opinion; because
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65912:33"/>
I would not be thought of his Opinion all
through, would not your Lordship be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with me for supposing you to have
such a meaning as this, and ask me again,
Whether <hi>I could think you a Man of so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Sense</hi> to talk thus? And yet my Lord,
this is the best I can make of these Words,
which seem to me rather to discover a secret
in your way of dealing with me, than any
thing in me, that I am ashamed of.</p>
            <p>For I am not, nor ever shall be ashamed
to own any Opinion I have, because another
Man holds the same; and so far as that
brings me <hi>into his Company,</hi> I shall not be
troubled to be <hi>seen</hi> in it. But I shall never
think, That that entitles me to any other
of his Opinions, or makes me of <hi>his Company</hi>
in any other sense, how much soever that
be the design: For your Lordship has used
no small Art and Pains to make me of his
and the Unitarians Company in all that
they say, only because that Author has ten
lines in the beginning of his Book, which
agrees with something I have said in mine,
from whence we become Companions, so
universally united in Opinion, that <hi>They</hi>
must be entitled to all that I say, and I
to all that <hi>They</hi> say.</p>
            <p>My Lord, when I writ my Book, I could
not design <hi>to distinguish my self from the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the new way of Reasoning,</hi> who
were not then in being, nor are, that I
see, yet: Since I find nothing produced
out of the <hi>Vnitarians,</hi> nor the Author of
<hi>Christianity not Mysterious,</hi> to shew, That
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65912:33"/>
they make clear and distinct Ideas necessary
to Certainty. And all that I have done
since, has been to shew, That you had no
Reason to join my Book with Men (let them
be what <hi>they</hi> or <hi>those</hi> you please) who
founded Certainty only upon clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Ideas, when my Book did not found
it only upon clear and distinct Ideas. And
I cannot tell why the appealing to my Book
now should be called a <hi>choosing rather to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
my self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Reader must pardon me here for
this uncouth Phrase of joining my Book
with Men. For as your Lordship order'd
the matter (pardon me if I say in your new
way of writing) so it was, if your own
word may be taken in the Case: For, to
give me Satisfaction, you insist upon this,
That you did not join me with those <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi>
in their Opinions, but tell me they
used <hi>my Notions to other purposes than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
them;</hi> and so thee was no need for
me to <hi>distinguish my self from them,</hi> when
your Lordship had done it for me, as you
plead all along. Though here you are
pleased to tell me, That I was <hi>joined</hi> with
them, and That <hi>I found my self joined in such
Company as I did not desire to be seen in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, I could find my self <hi>joined in</hi>
no <hi>Company</hi> upon this occasion, but what
you <hi>joined me in.</hi> And therefore I beg
leave to ask your Lordship, Did you <hi>join
me in Company</hi> with those, in whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
you here say, <hi>I do not desire to be seen?</hi>
If you own that you did, how must I
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65912:34"/>
understand that Passage where you say,<note n="*" place="margin">Vindic. p. 239.</note>
That <hi>you must do that Right to the ingenious
Author of the Essay of Humane Vnderstanding,
from whence these Notions were borrowed, to
serve other Purposes than he intended them;</hi>
which you repeat again<note n="†" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 35.</note> as matter of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to me, and as a Proof of <hi>the care
you took not to be misunderstood.</hi> If you did
join me with them, what is become of all
the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in the Point, which your
Lordship has been at so much Pains about?
And if you did not <hi>join</hi> me with them, you
could not think I <hi>found</hi> my self <hi>joined</hi> with
them, or <hi>chose to distinguish my self from
Men</hi> I was never joined with. For my Book
was innocent of what made them <hi>Gentlemen
of the new way of Reasoning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There seems to me something very deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
in this matter. I should be supposed
<hi>joined</hi> to them, and your Lordship should not
be supposed to have <hi>joined</hi> me to them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so slight or no occasion; and yet all
this comes solely from your Lordship. How
to do this to your satisfaction, I confess my
self to be too dull: And therefore I have
been at the Pains to examine how far I have
this Obligation to your Lordship; and how
far you would be pleased to own it, that the
World might understand your Lordship's,
to me, incomprehensible way of writing on
this occasion.</p>
            <p>For if you had a Mind by a new and very
dexterous way, becoming the learning and
caution of a great Man, to bring me into
<hi>such Company,</hi> which you think <hi>I did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65912:34"/>
to be seen in:</hi> I thought such a Pattern
set by such an Hand as your Lordship's, ought
not to be lost by being passed over too
slightly. Besides, I hope, that you will not
take it amiss, that I was willing to see, what
Obligation I had to your Lordship in the
favour your designed me. But I crave leave
to assure your Lordship, I shall never be
ashamed to own any Opinion I have, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
another Man (of whom perhaps your
Lordship or others have no very good
Thoughts) is of it, nor be unwilling to be
so far <hi>seen in his Company:</hi> Though I shall
always think I have a right to demand, and
shall desire to be satisfied, why any one
makes to himself, or takes an occasion from
thence, in manner that favours not too
much of Charity to extend this Society to
those Opinions of that Man, with which
I have nothing to do, That the World
may see the Justice and good Will of such
endeavours, and judge whether such arts sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
not a little of the Spirit of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p>For if I mistake not, 'tis the method of
that holy Office, and the way of those rever'd
Guardians of what they call the Christian
Faith, to raise Reports or start occasions of
Suspition concerning the Orthodoxy of any
one they have no very good Will towards;
and require him to clear himself, guilding
all this with the care of Religion, and the
Profession of respect and tenderness to the
Person himself, even when they deliver him
up to be Burnt by the secular Power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:65912:35"/>
I shall not my Lord say, That you have
had any ill Will to me, for I never deserved
any from you. But I shall be better able
to answer those, who are apt to think the
Method you have taken, has some Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
so far as it has gon; with what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
complain of in the Inquisition, when
you shall have <hi>cleared</hi> this matter a little
otherwise, and assigned a more sufficient
Reason, for bringing me into the Party of
those that oppose the Doctrin of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
than only because, The Author of
<hi>Christianity not Mysterious,</hi> has in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Book, half a Score Lines which
you guess he borrowed out of mine. For
that in Truth is all the matter of fact, upon
which all this Dust is raised; and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so advanced by degrees, that now I am
told, I should have <hi>cleared my self, by own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Doctrin of the Trinity:</hi> As if I had been
ever accused of disowning it. But that
which shews no small skill in this manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is, That I am called upon to <hi>clear
my self,</hi> by the very same Person who raising
the whole Dispute, has himself over and
over again cleared me; and upon that
grounds the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> he pretends to give
to me and others, in answer to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of his having without any Reason at
all, brought my Book into the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
concerning the Trinity. But to go
on.</p>
            <p>If the preceding part of this Paragraph,
had nothing in it of <hi>Defence</hi> of this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<hi>That those who offer at clear and distinct
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65912:35"/>
Ideas, bid much fairer for Certainty than I
do,</hi> &amp;c. It is certain, That what follows,
is altogether as remote from any such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 10.</note> That <hi>Certainty by
Sense, Certainty by Reason,</hi> and <hi>Certainty by
Remembrance, are to be distinguished from the
Certainty</hi> under debate, and to be shut out
from it: And upon this you spend the 11th,
12th and 13th Pages. Supposing it so, how
does this at all tend to the <hi>defence</hi> of this
Proposition, That <hi>those who offer at clear and
distinct Ideas, bid much fairer for Certainty
than I do?</hi> For whether <hi>Certainty by Sense,
by Reason and by Remembrance,</hi> be or be not
comprehended in the <hi>Certainty</hi> under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
this Proposition, That <hi>those who offer
at clear and distinct Ideas, bid much fairer for
Certainty than I do,</hi> will not at all be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
or invalidated thereby.</p>
            <p>The proving therefore, That <hi>Certainty
by Sense, by Reason, and by Remembrance,</hi>
is to be excluded from the Certainty under
debate, serving nothing to the <hi>defence</hi> of
the Proposition to be <hi>defended,</hi> and so
having nothing to do here, let us now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it as a Proposition, that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
has a Mind to prove, as serving to some
other great purpose of your own, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
in some other View against my Book;
for you seem to lay no small stress upon it,
by your way of introducing it. For you
very solemnly set your self to prove,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 9. &amp; 10.</note> 
               <hi>That
the Certainty under debate, is the Certainty of
Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>that a Proposition whose Ideas
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65912:36"/>
are to be compared as to their agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
is the proper object of this Certainty.</hi>
From whence your Lordship infers,<note n="†" place="margin">p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. 11, 12.</note> That
<hi>therefore this Certainty is to be distinguished
from a Certainty by Sense, by Reason</hi> and <hi>by
Remembrance.</hi> But by what Logick this is
infer'd, is not easy to me to discover. For
if a <hi>Proposition, whose Ideas are to be compared
as to their agreement or disagreement, be the
proper object of the Certainty</hi> under debate;
If Propositions whose Certainty we arrive
at by <hi>Sense, Reason</hi> or <hi>Remembrance</hi> be of
Ideas, which may be compared, as to their
agreement or disagreement, then they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be excluded from that Certainty, which
is to be had by so comparing those Ideas:
Unless they must be shut out for the very
same Reason, that others are taken in.</p>
            <p>1. Then as to <hi>Certainty by Sense</hi> or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of that kind.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Object of the Certainty under debate,</hi>
your Lordship <hi>owns, is a Proposition whose
Ideas are to be compared as to their agreement
or disagreement.</hi> The agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of the Ideas of a Proposition to be
compared, may be examined and perceived
by Sense, and is <hi>Certainty by Sense:</hi> And
therefore how this <hi>Certainty</hi> is to be <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished</hi>
and <hi>shut out</hi> from that, which consists
in the perceiving the agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of the Ideas of any Proposition,
will not be easy to shew; unless one <hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
is <hi>distinguished</hi> from another, by having
that, which makes the other to be Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>viz.</hi> The perception of the agreement
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65912:36"/>
or disagreement of two Ideas, as expressed
in that Proposition, <hi>v. g.</hi> May I not be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that a Ball of Ivory that lies before my
Eyes is not square? And is it not my Sense
of Seeing, that makes me perceive the disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of that square Figure, to that
round Matter, which are the Ideas expressed
in that Proposition? How then is Certainty
by Sense excluded or <hi>distinguished</hi> from, that
knowledge which consists in the perception
of the agreement or disagreement of Ideas?</p>
            <p>2. Your Lordship <hi>distinguishes</hi> the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which consists in the perceiving the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or disagreement of Ideas, as expressed
in any Proposition <hi>from Certainty by Reason.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 11.</note>
To have made good this distinction, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceive, you would have done well to
have shewed that the agreement or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of two Ideas could not be perceived
by the intervention of a third, which I, and
as I guess other People call Reasoning, or
knowing by Reason. As for example, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
the sides of a given Triangle, be known
to be equal by the Intervention of two
Circles, whereof one of these sides is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Radius?</p>
            <p>To which 'tis like your Lordship will
answer, what I find you do here,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 12.</note> about
the knowledge of the existence of Substance,
by the intervention of the existence of Modes,
<hi>That you grant one may come to Certainty of
Knowledge in the case; but not a Certainty by
Ideas, but by a Consequence of Reason deduced
from the Ideas we have by our Senses.</hi> This,
my Lord, you have said, and thus you have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65912:37"/>
more than once opposed Reason and Ideas
as inconsistent, which I should be very
glad to see proved once, after these several
occasions I have given your Lordship, by
excepting against that Supposition. But
since the word <hi>Idea</hi> has the ill luck to be so
constantly opposed by your Lordship to
Reason, Permit me if you please instead
of it, to put what I mean by it, <hi>viz.</hi> the
immediate objects of the Mind in thinking
(for that is it which I would signifie by the
word <hi>Ideas</hi>) and then let us see how your
answer will run. You grant that from
the sensible Modes of Bodies, <hi>we may come
to a certain Knowledge,</hi> that there are <hi>Bodily
Substances;</hi> but this you say is <hi>not</hi> a Certainty
by the immediate objects of the Mind in
thinking, <hi>but by a consequence of Reason de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from</hi> the immediate objects of the
Mind in thinking, <hi>which we have by our Senses.</hi>
When you can prove that we can have a
Certainty, <hi>by a consequence of Reason;</hi> which
Certainty shall not also be by the immediate
objects of the Mind in using its Reason, you
may say such Certainty is <hi>not by Ideas</hi> but <hi>by
Consequence of Reason.</hi> But that I believe
will not be, till you can shew, That the
Mind can think, or reason, or know, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
immediate objects of thinking, reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or knowing, all which Objects, as your
Lordship knows, I call <hi>Ideas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You subjoin,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 12.</note> And <hi>this can never prove
that we have Certainty by Ideas, where the Ideas
themselves are not clear and distinct.</hi> The
Question is not, whether <hi>we can have Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65912:37"/>
by Ideas that are not clear and distinct?</hi>
Or whether my Words (if by the Particle
<hi>This,</hi> you mean my Words set down in
the foregoing Page) prove any such thing,
which I humbly conceive they do not. But
whether <hi>Certainty by Reason,</hi> be excluded
from the Certainty under debate, which I
humbly conceive you have not from my
Words or any other way proved.</p>
            <p>3. The third sort of Propositions that
your Lordship excludes,<note place="margin">p. 12.</note> are those whose
<hi>Certainty</hi> we know by <hi>Remembrance,</hi> but in
these two the agreement or disagreement
of the Ideas contained in them is perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
not always indeed, as it was at first
by an actual view of the Connection of all
the intermediate Ideas, whereby the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or disagreement of those in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
was at first perceived, but by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intermediate Ideas, that shew the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or disagreement of the Ideas contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Proposition, whose Certainty we
remember.</p>
            <p>As in the instance you here make use of,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the three Angles of a Triangle
are equal to two right ones. The Certainty
of which Proposition we know by Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
though <hi>the Demonstration hath sliped
out of our Minds;</hi> but we know it in a
different way from what your Lordship sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
The agreement of the two Ideas,
as joined in that Proposition is perceived,
but it is by the intervention of other Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
than those which at first produced that
Perception. I remember, <hi>i. e.</hi> I know (for
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65912:38"/>
Remembrance is but the reviving of some
past Knowledge) that I was once certain
of the truth of this Proposition, That the
three Angles of a Triangle are equal to
two right ones. The immutability of the
same Relations between the same immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things, is now the Idea that shews me,
that if the three Angles of a Triangle were
once equal to two right ones, they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be equal to two right ones; and
hence I come to be certain, that what was
once true in the Case is always true;
what Ideas once agreed, will always agree;
and consequently what I once knew to be
true, I shall always know to be true as
long as I can remember that I once knew
it.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 9.</note> 
               <hi>That the Debate
between us is about Certainty of Knowledge,
with regard to some Proposition whose Ideas are
to be compared as to their agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement:</hi>
Out of this Debate you say, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
by <hi>Sense,</hi> by <hi>Reason</hi> and by <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi>
is to be excluded. I desire you then,
my Lord, to tell what sort of Propositions
will be within the <hi>Debate,</hi> and to name me
one of them; if Propositions, whose Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
we know by <hi>Sense, Reason,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi>
are excluded?</p>
            <p>However, from what you have said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, your Lordship in the next
Paragraph concludes them <hi>out of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;</hi>
your Words are, <hi>These things then
being out of the Question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:65912:38"/>
Out of what Question, I beseech you,
my Lord? The Question here, and that of
your own proposing to be defended in the
Affirmative is this, Whether <hi>those who offer
at clear and distinct Ideas, bid much fairer
for Certainty than I do?</hi> And how Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by Sense, by Reason, and by Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
comes to have any particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
in reference to this Question, 'tis
my misfortune not to be able to find.</p>
            <p>But your Lordship leaving the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Question under debate, by a
new state of the Question, would pin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me what I never said. Your Words
are,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 13.</note> 
               <hi>These things then being put out of the
Question which belong not to it. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
truly stated is, Whether we can attain to
any Certainty of Knowledge as to the truth of
a Proposition in the way of Ideas, where the
Ideas themselves, by which we came to that
Certainty, be not clear and distinct?</hi> With
Submission, my Lord, that which I say in
the Point, is, That we may be certain of
the truth of a Proposition concerning an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea
which is not in all its parts clear and
distinct; and therefore if your Lordship will
have any <hi>Question</hi> with me concerning this
matter, <hi>the Question truly stated is, Whether
we can frame any Proposition concerning a
thing whereof we have but an obscure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Idea, of whose Truth we can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is the Question, you will easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agree, when you will give your self the
trouble to look back to the Rise of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:65912:39"/>
Your Lordship having found out a strange
sort of Men<note n="†" place="margin">Vindic. p. 232.</note> who had broached <hi>a Doctrin
which supposed that we must have clear and
distinct Ideas of what ever we pretend to a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of in our Minds,</hi> was pleased for this
to call them the <hi>Gentlemen of a new way of
Reasoning,</hi> and to make me one of them. I
answer'd, that I placed not Certainty only in
clear and distinct Ideas, and so ought not to
have been made one of them, being not guilty
of what made <hi>a Gentleman of this new way
of Reasoning.</hi> 'Tis pretended still, that I
am guilty; and indeavour'd to be prov'd.
To know now whether I am or no, it must
be consider'd what you lay to their Charge,
as the consequence of that Opinion; and
that is, That upon this Ground <hi>we cannot
come to any Certainty that there is such a thing
as Substance.</hi> This appears by more places
than one. Your Lordship asks,<note n="*" place="margin">Vindic. p. 240.</note> 
               <hi>How is
it possible that we may be certain that there are
both bodily and spiritual Substances, if our
Reason depend upon clear and distinct Ideas?</hi>
And again,<note n="†" place="margin">ib.</note> 
               <hi>How come we to be certain
that there are spiritual Substances in the World,
since we can have no clear and distinct Ideas
concerning them?</hi> And your Lordship having
set down some Words out of my Book,
as if they were inconsistent with my
Principle of Certainty founded only in clear
and distinct Ideas, You say,<note n="*" place="margin">Vindic. p. 244.</note> 
               <hi>From whence
it follows that we may be certain of the Being of a
spiritual Substance, though we have no clear
and distinct Ideas of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:65912:39"/>
Other places might be produced, but
these are enough to shew, That those who
held clear and distinct Ideas necessary to
Certainty, were accused to extend it thus
far, that where any Idea was obscure and
confused, there no Proposition could be
made concerning it, of whose truth we
could be certain, <hi>v. g.</hi> we could not be
certain that there was in the World such
a thing as <hi>Substance,</hi> because we had but an
obscure and confus'd Idea of it.</p>
            <p>In this sense therefore I denyed that clear
and distinct Ideas were necessary to Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
<hi>v. g.</hi> I denyed it to be my Doctrin,
That where an Idea was obscure and
confus'd, there no Proposition could be
made concerning it, of whose Truth we
could be certain. For I held we might
be certain of the truth of this Proposition,
That there was <hi>Substance</hi> in the World,
though we have but an obscure and confus'd
Idea of <hi>Substance:</hi> And your Lordship en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to prove we could not, as may
be seen at large in that 10th Chapter of
your <hi>Vindication,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From all which it is evident, that the
Question between us <hi>truly stated</hi> is this,
Whether we can attain Certainty of the
truth of a Proposition concerning any thing
whereof we have but an obscure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
Idea?</p>
            <p>This being the Question, the first thing
you say,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 13.</note> is, That <hi>Des Cartes</hi> was of your
Opinion against me. <hi>Answ.</hi> If the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
were to be decided by Authority, I
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65912:40"/>
had rather it should be by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
than <hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I should excuse my self to you, as
not having needed, that you should have
added his Authority to yours, to shame me
into a Submission; or that you should have
been at the Pains to have transcribed so
much out of him, for my sake, were it fit
for me to hinder the display of the Riches
of your Lordship's universal reading; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
I doubt not, but I should take pleasure
my self, if I had it to shew.</p>
            <p>I come therefore to what I think your
Lordship principally aimed at; which, as I
humbly conceive, was to shew out of my
Book, That I founded Certainty only on clear
and distinct Ideas. <hi>And yet,</hi> as you say,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 15.</note> 
               <hi>I have complained of your Lordship in near
twenty places of my Second Letter, for charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this upon me. By this the World will judge
of the Iustice of my Complaints, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
of my Notion of Ideas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> What <hi>Consistency of my Notion of
Ideas has to do here,</hi> I know not; for I do
not remember, that I made any Complaint
concerning that. But supposing my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
were ill grounded in this one case
concerning Certainty; yet, they might be
reasonable in other Points; and therefore,
with Submission, I humbly conceive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
was a little too large, to conclude
from this particular against my Complaints
in general.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:65912:40"/>
In the next place I answer, That sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the places which your Lordship
brings out of my Book did prove what they
do not, <hi>viz.</hi> That I founded Certainty on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in clear and distinct Ideas, yet my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
in the Case are very just. For your
Lordship at first brought me into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
and made me one of <hi>the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the new way of Reasoning,</hi> for found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Certainty on clear and distinct Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
only upon a bare <hi>Supposition</hi> that I did so,
which I think your Lordship confesses in
these Words;<note n="†" place="margin">p. 9.</note> where you say, That <hi>you
do not deny but the first occasion of your Charge,
was the Supposition that clear and distinct Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
were necessary in order to any Certainty in
our Minds; and that the only way to attain this
Certainty, was the comparing</hi> these, <hi>i. e.</hi> clear
and distinct <hi>Ideas together; but to prove this,
my Words,</hi> your Lordship says, <hi>were produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and my Principles of Certainty laid
down and none else. Answer.</hi> 'Tis strange,
that when my <hi>Principles of Certainty were
laid down,</hi> this (if I held it) was not found
amongst them: Having looked therefore, I
do not find in that place, that any <hi>Words
or Principles of mine were produced</hi> to prove
that I held, That the only way to attain
Certainty, was by comparing only clear
and distinct Ideas; so that all that then
made me one of <hi>the Gentlemen of the new
way of Reasoning,</hi> was only your supposing
that I supposed that clear and distinct Ideas
are necessary to Certainty. And therefore
I had then and have still, reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65912:41"/>
That your Lordship brought me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Controversie upon so slight Grounds,
which I humbly conceive will always shew
it to have proceeded not so much from any
thing you had then found in my Book, as
from a great willingness in your Lordship
at any rate to do it; and of this the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
which you have here now produced
out of my <hi>Essay</hi> are an evident Proof.</p>
            <p>For if your Lordship had then known any
thing that seemed so much to your purpose,
when you <hi>produced,</hi> as you say, <hi>my Words
and my Principles to prove,</hi> That I held clear
and distinct Ideas necessary to Certainty, it
cannot be believed that you would have
omitted these Passages, either then or in
your Answer to my first Letter, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
them to this your Answer to my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
These Passages therefore now quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here by your Lordship, give me leave,
my Lord, to suppose have been by a new
and diligent search found out, and are now
at last brought <hi>post factum</hi> to give some
colour to your way of proceeding with me,
though these Passages being, as I suppose,
then unknown to you; they could not be
the Ground of making me one of <hi>those</hi> who
place Certainty only in clear and distinct Ideas.</p>
            <p>Let us come to the Passages themselves,
and see what help they afford you.</p>
            <p>The first Words you set down out of my
<hi>Essay</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">B. 4. C. 18. §. 8.</note> are these, <q>The Mind not being
certain of the truth of that it doth not
evidently know.</q> From these Words,
that which I infer in that place, is, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65912:41"/>
               <q>Therefore the Mind is bound in such
Cases, to give up its Assent to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
Testimony.</q> But your Lordship
from them infers here,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore I make
clear Ideas necessary to Certainty;</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by considering the immediate Objects
of the Mind in thinking, we cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that <hi>Substance</hi> (whereof we have an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and confus'd Idea) doth exist. I shall
leave your Lordship to make good this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
when you think fit, and proceed to
the next Passage you alledge, which you say
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 15.</note> proves it <hi>more plainly.</hi> I believe it will
be thought it should be proved more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or else it will not be proved at all.</p>
            <p>This plainer Proof is out of B. 4. Ch.
4. Sect. 8. in these words, <q>That which
is requisite to make our Knowledge cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
is the clearness of our Ideas.</q> 
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
The Certainty here spoken of, is the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of general Propositions in Morality,
and not of the particular Existence of any
thing; and therefore tends not at all to
any such Position as this, That we cannot
be certain of the existence of any particular
sort of Being, though we have but an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and confus'd Idea of it. Though
it does affirm, That we cannot have any
certain Perception of the Relations of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Moral Ideas (wherein consists the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of general Moral Propositions) any
farther than those Ideas are clear in our
Minds. And that this is so, I refer my
Reader to that Chapter for Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65912:42"/>
The third place produced<note n="*" place="margin">p. 15.</note> by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
out of <hi>B. 4. Ch. 12. Sect.</hi> 14. is, <q>For
it being evident that our Knowledge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
exceed our Ideas, where they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imperfect, confused or obscure; we
cannot expect to have certain perfect or
clear Knowledge.</q> To understand these
Words aright, we must see in what place
they stand, and that is in a Chapter of the
improvement of our Knowledge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are brought as a reason to shew how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it is <q>for the enlarging of our
Knowledge, to get and setle in our Minds
as far as we can, clear distinct and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Ideas of those things we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
and know.</q> The Reason whereof
there given, is this, That as far as they are
only imperfect, confused and obscure; we
cannot expect to have certain, perfect or
clear Knowledge, <hi>i. e.</hi> that our Knowledge
will not be clear and certain so far as the Idea
is imperfect and obscure. Which will not at
all reach your Lordship's purpose, who
would argue, that because I say our Idea of
<hi>Substance</hi> is obscure and confused, therefore
upon my Grounds, we cannot know that
such a thing as <hi>Substance</hi> exists; because I
placed Certainty only in clear and distinct
Ideas. Now to this I answer'd, that I did
not place all Certainty only on clear and
distinct Ideas, in such a Sense as that, and
therefore to avoid being mistaken, I said,
<note n="†" place="margin">2 Answ. p. 50.</note> 
               <q>That my Notion of Certainty by Ideas,
is, that Certainty consists in the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the agreement or disagreement
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65912:42"/>
of Ideas; such as we have, whether they
be in all their parts <hi>perfectly</hi> clear and
distinct or no,</q> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> if they are clear and
distinct enough to be capable of having their
agreement or disagreement with any other
Idea perceived, so far they are capable of
affording us Knowledge, though at the same
time they are so obscure and confused, as that
there are other Ideas, with which we can
by no means so compare them, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their agreement or disagreement with
them. This was the clearness and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which I denyed to be necessary to Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
            <p>If your Lordship would have done me the
honour to have consider'd what I understood
by obscure and confused Ideas, and what
every one must understand by them, who
thinks clearly and distinctly concerning
them, I am apt to imagine you would have
spared your self the trouble of raising this
Question, and omitted these Quotations out
of my Book, as not serving to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
purpose.</p>
            <p>The fourth Passage which you seem to
lay most stress on, proves as little to your
purpose as either of the former Three.
The Words<note n="*" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 2. §. 15.</note> are these. <q>But obscure and
confused Ideas, can never produce any
clear and certain Knowledge. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as far as any Ideas are confused
or obscure, the Mind can never perceive
clearly whether they agree or no.</q> The
latter part of these Words, are a plain
interpretation of the former, and shew
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65912:43"/>
their meaning to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> Our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and confused Ideas, as they stand
in contra-distinction to clear and distinct,
have all of them something in them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are kept from being wholly imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
and perfectly confounded with all
other Ideas, and so their agreement or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
with at least some other Ideas,
may be perceived, and thereby produce
Certainty, though they are obscure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Ideas. But so <hi>far</hi> as they are obscure
and confused, so that their agreement or
disagreement cannot be perceived, so <hi>far</hi>
they cannot produce Certainty, <hi>v. g.</hi> the
Idea of <hi>Substance</hi> is clear and distinct enough
to have its agreement with that of <hi>actual
Existence</hi> perceived: But yet it is so far ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and confused, that there be a great
many other Ideas, with which, by reason
of its obscurity and confusedness, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
compare it so, as to produce such a
Perception: And in all those Cases we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
come short of Certainty. And that
this was so, and that I meant so, I humbly
conceive, you could not but have seen, if
you had given your self the trouble to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on that Passage which you quoted, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 7.</note> 
               <q>That Certainty consists in the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the agreement or disagreement
of Ideas, such as we have, whether they
be in all their parts perfectly clear and
distinct or no. </q> To which, what your
Lordship has here brought out of the second
Book of my Essay, is no manner of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
unless it be a Contradiction to say,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65912:43"/>
that an Idea which cannot be well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with some Ideas, from which it is
not clearly and sufficiently distinguishable,
is yet capable of having its agreement or
disagreement perceived with some other
Idea, with which it is not so confounded,
but that it may be compared. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I had, and have still reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of your Lordship, for charging that
upon me, which I never said nor meant.</p>
            <p>To make this yet more visible, give me
leave to make use of an Instance in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the Eyes in Seeing, from whence
the Metaphor of obscure and confused is
transfer'd to Ideas the objects of the Mind
in Thinking. There is no object which
the Eye sees, that can be said to be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obscure, for then it would not be seen
at all; nor perfectly confused; for then it
could not be distinguished from any other,
no not from a clearer. For Example, one
sees in the Dusk something of that shape and
size, that a Man in that degree of Light and
distance would appear. This is not so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
that he sees nothing, nor so confused
that he cannot distinguish it from a Steeple
or a Star; But is so obscure, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
thought it be a Statue distinguish it from
a Man, and therefore in regard of a Man,
it can produce no clear and distinct Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
But yet as obscure and confused an
Idea as it is, this hinders not, but there
may many propositions be made concerning
it, as particularly that it exists, of the
Truth of which we may be certain. And

that without any Contradiction to what
I say in my Essay, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That obscure and
confused Ideas can never produce any
clear and certain Knowledge. Because
as far as they are confused or obscure,
the Mind cannot perceive clearly whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they agree or no.</q> This reason that
I there give, plainly limiting it only to
Knowledge, where the obscurity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
is such, that it hinders the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of agreement or disagreement, which
is not so great in any obscure and confused
Idea, but that there is some other Ideas,
with which it may be perceived to agree
or disagree, and there 'tis capable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Certainty in us.</p>
            <p>And thus I am come to the end of your
<hi>Defence</hi> of your <hi>first Answer,</hi> as you call it,
and desire the Reader to consider, how
much in the eight Pages imploy'd in it, is
said to <hi>defend</hi> this Proposition, <hi>that Those
who offer at clear and distinct Ideas, bid much
fairer for Certainty than I do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But your Lordship having under this
Head taken occasion to examine my making
clear and distinct Ideas necessary to Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty;
I crave leave to consider here,
what you say of it in another place. I find
one Argument more to prove, That I place
Certainty only in clear and distinct Ideas.
Your Lordship tells me,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 63.</note> and bids me <hi>observe
my own Words, that I positively say,</hi> 
               <q>That
the Mind not being certain of the Truth
of that it doth not evidently know.</q> 
               <hi>So
that,</hi> says your Lordship, <hi>it is plain here, that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65912:44"/>
I place Certainty in evident Knowledge, <hi>or in
clear and distinct Ideas,</hi> and yet my great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of your Lordship was, that you charged
this upon me, and now you find it in my own
Words. Answer,</hi> I do <hi>observe</hi> my own Words,
but do not find in them, <hi>or in clear and
distinct Ideas,</hi> though your Lordship has set
these down as my Words. I there indeed
say, <q>The Mind is not certain of what
it does not evidently know.</q> Whereby
I place Certainty, as your Lordship says,
only in <hi>evident Knowledge,</hi> but evident Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
may be had in the clear and evident
perception of the agreement or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ideas; though some of them should
not be in all their parts perfectly clear and
distinct, as is evident in this Proposition,
that <hi>Substance does Exist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you give not off this Matter so. For
these Words of mine above quoted<note n="*" place="margin">p. 15.</note> by
your Lordship, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>It being evident that
our Knowledge cannot exceed our Ideas,
where they are imperfect, confused or
obscure, we cannot expect to have certain,
perfect or clear Knowledge</q> your
Lordship has here<note n="†" place="margin">p. 63.</note> up again: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
charge it on me as a contradiction,
that confessing our Ideas to be imperfect,
confused and obscure, I say, I do not yet
place Certainty in clear and distinct Ideas.
<hi>Answer,</hi> The Reason is plain, for I do not
say that all our Ideas are imperfect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
and obscure; nor that obscure and
confused Ideas are in all their parts so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and confused, that no agreement or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65912:45"/>
disagreement between them and any other
Idea can be perceived, and therefore my
confession of imperfect, obscure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Ideas, takes not away all Knowledge,
even concerning those very Ideas.</p>
            <p>But, says your Lordship, <hi>Can Certainty be
had with imperfect and obscure Ideas, and yet
no Certainty be had by them?</hi> Add if you please,
my Lord, [by those parts of them which
are obscure and confused.] And then the
Question will be right put, and have this
easie Answer. Yes, my Lords, and that
without any contradiction, because an Idea
that is not in all its parts perfectly clear and
distinct, and is therefore an obscure and
confused Idea; may yet with those Ideas,
with which, by any obscurity it has, it is
not confounded, be capable to produce
Knowledge by the perception of its agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or disagreement with them. And
yet it will hold true, that in that part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is imperfect, obscure and confused, we
cannot expect to have certain, perfect or
clear Knowledge.</p>
            <p>For Example, he that has the Idea of a
Leopard, as only of a spotted Animal, must
be confessed to have but a very imperfect,
obscure and confused Idea of that <hi>Species</hi> of
Animals; and yet this obscure and confused
Idea, is capable by a perception of the
agreement or disagreement of the clear part
of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Animal,</hi> with several
other Ideas to produce Certainty: Though
as far as the obscure part of it confounds it
with the Idea of a Lynx, or other spotted
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65912:45"/>
Animal it can, joyn'd with them, in many
Propositions, produce no Knowledge.</p>
            <p>This might easily be understood to be
my meaning by these Words, which your
Lordship quotes<note n="*" place="margin">p. 122.</note> out of my <hi>Essay,</hi> viz.
<q>That our Knowledge consisting in the
perception of the agreement or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any two Ideas, its clearness or
obscurity consists in the clearness or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity
of that Perception, and not in
the clearness or obscurity of the Ideas
themselves.</q> Upon which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
asks,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 122.</note> 
               <hi>How is it possible for the Mind
to have a clear perception of the agreement of
Ideas, if the Ideas themselves be not clear and
distinct? Answer,</hi> Just as the Eyes can have
a clear perception of the agreement or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
of the clear and distinct parts of
a Writing, with the clear parts of another;
though one, or both of them, be so obscure
and blur'd in other parts, that the Eye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perceive any agreement or disagreement
they have one with another. And I am
sorry that these Words of mine<note n="†" place="margin">2 Let. p. 50.</note> 
               <q>My
Notion of Certainty by Ideas, is, that
Certainty consists in the perception of
the agreement or disagreement of Ideas,
such as we have, whether they be in all
their parts perfectly clear and distinct
or no,</q> were not plain enough to make
your Lordship understand my meaning, and
save you all this new, and as it seems to me,
needless trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:65912:46"/>
In your 15th Page, your Lordship comes
to your second of the three <hi>Answers which</hi>
you say<note n="*" place="margin">p. 7.</note> you <hi>had given</hi> and would <hi>lay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
and defend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You say<note n="†" place="margin">p. 15.</note> (2) you answer'd, <hi>That it is
very possible the Author of</hi> Christianity not
Mysterious, <hi>might mistake or misapply my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
but there is too much reason to believe,
he thought them the same; and we have no
reason to be sorry that he hath given me this
occasion for the explaining my meaning, and for
the Vindication of my self in the matters I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
he had charged me with.</hi> These
words your Lordship quotes out of the 36th
Page of your first Letter. But as I have
already observed they are not there given
as an answer to <hi>this</hi> that you make me
here say; and therefore to what purpose
you repeat them here is not easie to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
unless it can be thought that an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfactory
answer in one place can become
satisfactory by being repeated in another,
where it is, as I humbly conceive, less to
the purpose, and no answer at all. It was
there indeed given as an answer to my
saying, That I did not place Certainty in
clear and distinct Ideas, which I said to shew
that you had no reason to bring me into the
Controversie, because the Author of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
not Mysterious</hi> placed Certainty in clear
and distinct Ideas. To satisfie me for your
doing so, your Lordship answers, <hi>That it was
very possible that Author might mistake or misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
my Notions.</hi> A reason indeed, that will
equally justifie your bringing my Book into
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65912:46"/>
any Controversie: For there is no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
so infallible, write he in what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
he pleases, but <hi>'tis possible</hi> he may
<hi>mistake, or misapply my Notions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That was the force of this your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
<hi>Answer</hi> in that place of your first
Letter, but what it serves for in this place
of your second Letter I have not Wit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to see. The remainder of it I have
answer'd in the 37th and 38th Pages of my
second Letter, and therefore cannot but
wonder to see it repeated here again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any notice taken of what I said in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to it, though you set it down here
again, as you say, <hi>p.</hi> 7. on purpose to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all the <hi>defence</hi> made, is only to that
part of my Reply which you set down<note n="*" place="margin">p. 16.</note> as
a fresh Complaint that I make in these
Words, <q>This can be no reason why I
should be joined with a Man that had
misapplied my Notions, and that no
Man hath so much mistaken and misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
my Notions as your Lordship; and
therefore I ought rather to be joined with
your Lordship.</q> And then you, with
some warmth, subjoin; <hi>But is this fair and
ingenuous dealing, to represent this Matter so,
as if your Lordship had joined us together, because
he had misunderstood and misapplied my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
Can I think your Lordship a Man of
so little Sense to make that the reason of it?</hi>
No; Sir, says your Lordship, <hi>it was because
he assigned no other Grounds but mine, and
that in my own Words; however, now I
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65912:47"/>
would divert the meaning of them another
way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, I did set down your Words at
large in my second Letter, and therefore do
not see how I could be liable to any Charge
of <hi>unfair</hi> or <hi>disingenuous dealing in represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Matter;</hi> which I am sure you will
allow as a Proof of my not <hi>misrepresenting,</hi>
since I find you use it your self<note n="*" place="margin">p. 133.</note> as a sure
Fence against any such Accusation; where
you tell me, <hi>That you have set down my own
Words at large, that I may not complain that
your Lordship misrepresents my Sense.</hi> The
same Answer I must desire my Reader to
apply for me to your 73d and 90th Pages,
where your Lordship makes Complaints of
the like kind with this here.</p>
            <p>The Reasons you give for joining me
with the Author of <hi>Christianity not Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi>
are put down <hi>verbatim</hi> as you gave
them; and if they did not give me that
<hi>Satisfaction</hi> they were designed for, am I to
be blamed that I did not find them better
than they were? You joined me with that
Author because he placed Certainty only in
clear and distinct Ideas. I told your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
I did not do so, and therefore that
could be no reason for your joining me with
him. You answer, <hi>'Twas possible he might
mistake or misapply my Notions.</hi> So that our
agreeing in the Notion of Certainty (the
pretended Reason for which we were join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
failing, all the reason which is left
and which you offer in this Answer for your
joining of us, is the <hi>possibility of his mistaking
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65912:47"/>
my Notions.</hi> And I think it a very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Inference, that if the meer <hi>possibility</hi> of
any ones <hi>mistaking me,</hi> be a reason for my
being <hi>joined with him:</hi> Any ones actual mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking
me, is a stronger reason why I should
be joined with him. But if such an Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
shews (more than you would have it)
the satisfactoriness and force of your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
I hope you will not be angry with
me, if I cannot change the Nature of
things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordship indeed adds in that place,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 36.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi> there is too much reason to believe that
the Author thought his Notions and mine the
same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> When your Lordship shall produce
that <hi>Reason,</hi> it will be seen whether it were
<hi>too much</hi> or too little. Till it is produced,
there appears no Reason, at all; and such
concealed Reason, though it may be <hi>too much,</hi>
can be supposed, I think, to give very little
Satisfaction to me or any body else in the
Case.</p>
            <p>But to make good what you have said in
your Answer, your Lordship here<note n="†" place="margin">p. 16.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
That <hi>you did not join us together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had misunderstood and misapplied my
Notions. Answ.</hi> Neither did I say, That
therefore you did <hi>join us.</hi> But this I crave
leave to say, That all the reason you there
gave for your <hi>joining</hi> us <hi>together,</hi> was the
<hi>possibility of his mistaking and misapplying my
Notions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But your Lordship now tells<note n="*" place="margin">p. 16.</note> me, <hi>No,
Sir,</hi> this was not the reason of your <hi>join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:65912:48"/>
us; but <hi>it was because he assigned no other
Grounds but mine, and in my own Words.
Answ.</hi> My Lord, I do not remember that
in that place you give this as a reason for
your <hi>joining of us;</hi> and I could not answer in
that place to what you did not there say,
but to what you there did say. Now your
Lordship does say it it here, here I shall
take the liberty to answer it.</p>
            <p>The Reason you now give for your <hi>join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
me with that Author, is <hi>because he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
no other Grounds but mine,</hi> which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
tenderly expressed, is to be understood,
I suppose, that he did <hi>assign my Grounds.</hi> Of
what, I beseech your Lordship, did he <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
my Grounds and in my Words?</hi> If it
were not <hi>my Grounds</hi> of Certainty, it could
be no manner of reason for your <hi>joining</hi>
me with him; because the only reason
why at first you made him (and me with
him) <hi>a Gentleman of the new way of Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was his supposing clear and distinct Ideas
necessary to Certainty,</hi> which was <hi>the Opinion</hi>
that you declared <hi>you opposed.</hi> Now my
Lord, if you can shew where that Author
has <hi>in my Words assigned my Grounds</hi> of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
there will be some Grounds for
what you say here. But till your Lordship
does that, it will be pretty hard to believe
that to be the ground of your <hi>joining</hi> us
together; which being no where to be found
can scarce be thought the true <hi>reason</hi> of
your doing it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:65912:48"/>
               <hi>Your Lordship adds,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 16.</note> However, now I
would divert the meaning of <hi>Them</hi> [i. e. <hi>those
my Words</hi>] an other way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> When ever you are pleased to set
down those <hi>Words of mine wherein</hi> that Author
<hi>assigns my Grounds of Certainty,</hi> it will be seen
how <hi>I now divert their meaning another way;</hi>
till then they must remain with several
other of your Lordship's invisible <hi>Them,</hi>
which are no where to be found.</p>
            <p>But to your asking me,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 17.</note> Whether <hi>I can
think your Lordship a Man of that little Sense?</hi>
I crave leave to reply, That I hope it must
not be concluded, that as often as in your
way of writing I meet with any thing that
does not seem to me satisfactory, and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to shew that it does not prove,
what it is made use of for, that I present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>think your Lordship a Man of little Sense.</hi>
This would be a very hard Rule in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ones self; especially for me against so
great and learned a Man, whose reasons
and meaning it is not, I find, always easie for
so mean a Capacity as mine to reach; and
therefore I have taken great care to set
down your Words in most places, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
my self from the imputation of <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representing</hi>
your Sense, and to leave it fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before the Reader to judge, whether I
mistake it, and how far I am to be blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
if I do. And I would have set down
your whole Letter page by page as I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
it, would not that have made my
Book too big.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:65912:49"/>
If I must write under this fear, that
you apprehend I think meanly of you, as
often as I think any reason you make use
of is not satisfactory in the Point it is
brought for, the causes of uneasiness would
return too often; and it would be better
once for all, to conclude your Lordship
infallible, and acquiesce in whatever you
say, than in every page to be so rude as
to tell your Lordship, <hi>I think you have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Sense,</hi> if that be the interpretation of
my endeavouring to shew, that your reasons
come short any where.</p>
            <p>My Lord, when you did me the honour
to answer my first Letter (which I thought
might have passed for a submissive Complaint
of what I did not well understand, rather
than a Dispute with your Lordship) you were
pleased to insert into it direct Accusations
against my Book, which looked as if you
had a mind to enter into a direct Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
with me. This condescention in your
Lordship, has made me think my self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the protection of the Laws of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
which allow a free examining and
shewing the weakness of the Reasons brought
by the other side, without any offence. If
this be not permitted me, I must confess,
I have been mistaken, and have been guilty
in answering you any thing at all: For
how to answer without answering, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
I do not know.</p>
            <p>I wish you had never writ any thing that
I was particularly concerned to examine;
And what I have been concerned to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65912:49"/>
I wish it had given me no occasion
for any other answer, but an admiration
of the manner and justness of your Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
and an acknowledgment of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of that great Opinion, which I had
of your Lordship before. But I hope it is
not expected from me in this Debate, that
I should admit as good and conclusive all
that drops from your Pen, for fear of
causing so much displeasure as you seem
here to have upon this occasion, or for
fear you should object to me the presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thinking you had but <hi>little Sense,</hi> as
often as I endeavoured to shew, that what
you say is of little force.</p>
            <p>When those <hi>Words and Grounds of mine</hi>
are produced, that the Author of <hi>Christianity
not Mysterious, assigned,</hi> which your Lordship
thinks a sufficient <hi>reason</hi> for your <hi>joining me
with him,</hi> in opposing the Doctrin of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
I shall consider them, and endeavour
to give you Satisfaction about them as well
I have already concerning those ten Lines,
which you have more than once quoted
out of him, as taken out of my Book, and
which is all that your Lordship has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
out of him of that kind; in all which
there is not one Syllable of <hi>clear and distinct
Ideas,</hi> or of <hi>Certainty</hi> founded in them. In
the mean time, in answer to your other
Question,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 16.</note> 
               <hi>But is this fair and ingenuous
dealing?</hi> I refer my Reader to <hi>p.</hi> 35-38
of my second Letter, where he may see at
large all this whole matter, and all the
<hi>unfairness</hi> and <hi>disingenuity</hi> of it, which I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65912:50"/>
to him, to judge whether for any fault
of that kind, it ought to have drawn on
me the marks of so much displeasure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordship goes on here,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 16.</note> 
               <hi>and tells
me, That</hi> although you were willing to allow
me all reasonable occasions for my own Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as appears by your Words; yet you were
sensible enough that I had given too just an
occasion to apply them in that manner as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the next Page.</p>
            <p>What was it, I beseech you my Lord,
that I was to <hi>vindicate</hi> my self from, and
what was those <hi>Them</hi> I <hi>had given too just an
occasion to apply in that manner,</hi> and what was
that <hi>manner</hi> they were applied in, and what
was the <hi>occasion</hi> they were so applied? For
I can find none of all these in that <hi>next page</hi>
to which your Lordship refers me; when
those are set down, the World will be
the better able to judge of the <hi>Reason</hi> you
had <hi>to join</hi> me after the manner you did:
However, saying, my Lord, without prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I humbly conceive, is but saying, and
in such <hi>Personal Matter</hi> so turned, shews
more the disposition of the speaker, than
any ground for what is said. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
as a proof of your great care of me,
tells me<note n="†" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 36.</note> at the top of that Page, That
you had said so much that nothing <hi>could be
said more for my Vindication:</hi> And before
you come to the bottom of it, you labour
to persuade the World, That I have need
to vindicate my self. Another possibly,
who could find in his Heart to say two
such things, would have taken care they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65912:50"/>
should not have stood in the same Page,
where the Juxta-position might enlighten
them too much, and surprize the Sight.
But possibly your Lordship is so well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
of the Worlds readiness to believe
your Professions of good Will to me, as a
mark whereof you tell me here of
your willingness <hi>to allow me all reasonable
occasions to vindicate my self,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 16.</note> that no body
can see any thing but Kindness in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you say, though it appears in so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Shapes.</p>
            <p>In the following Words,<note place="margin">p. 16.</note> your Lordship
accuses me of too <hi>nice a</hi> piece of Criticism;
and tells me <hi>it looks like Chicaning. Answ.</hi>
I did not expect in a Controversie begun
and managed as this which your Lordship
has been pleased to have with me, to be
accused of <hi>Chicaning</hi> without great provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
because the mentioning that Word
might perhaps raise in the Reader's Minds
some odd Thoughts which were better spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
But this Accusation made me look
back into the places you quoted in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and there find the Matter to stand
thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To a pretty large quotation set down
out of the Postscript to my first Letter, you
subjoin,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 37.</note> Which Words seem to express so
much of a Christian Spirit and Temper, that
<hi>your Lordship</hi> cannot believe I intended to give
any advantage to the Enemies of the Christian
Faith; but whether there hath not been too just
occasion for them to apply <hi>them</hi> in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
is a thing very fit for me to consider.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:65912:51"/>
In my answer<note n="†" place="margin">2 Let. p. 45.</note> I take notice that the
Term <hi>Them,</hi> in this Passage of your
Lordship's can in the ordinary construction
of our Language be applied to nothing but
<hi>which Words</hi> in the beginning of that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
<hi>i. e.</hi> to my Words immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding.
This your Lordship calls <hi>Chican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
and gives this reason for it,<note n="*" place="margin">pag. 17.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi>
Because <hi>any one that reads without a design to
Cavil, would easily interpret <hi>Ihem</hi> of my Words
and Notions about which the Debate was.
Answ.</hi> That any one that reads that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
with or without <hi>design to Cavil,</hi> could
hardly make it intelligible without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
<hi>Them</hi> so, I readily grant; but
that it is easie for me or any body, to
interpret any ones meaning contrary to the
necessary construction and plain import of
the Words, that I crave leave to deny.
I am sure it is not <hi>Chicaning</hi> to presume,
that so great an Author as your Lordship,
writes according to the Rules of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
and as an other Man writes, who
understands our Language and would be
understood; to do the contrary, would
be a presumption liable to blame, and
might deserve the name of <hi>Chicaning</hi> and
<hi>Cavil.</hi> And that in this case it was not <hi>easie</hi> to
avoid the interpreting the term <hi>Them</hi> as
I did; the reason you give why I should
have done it, is a farther Proof. Your
Lordship, to shew it was <hi>easie,</hi> says <hi>the Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,
comes in but as a Parenthesis:</hi> Now
I challenge any one living, to shew me
where in that place the <hi>Parenthesis</hi> must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65912:51"/>
and where end, which can make <hi>Them</hi>
applicable to any thing, but the words of
my Postscript. I have tried with more
care and pains than is usually required of a
Reader in such cases, and cannot I must own
find where to make a breach in the Thread
of your Discourse, with the imaginary <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis,</hi>
which your Lordship mentions,
and was not I suppose omitted by the Printer
for want of Marks to Print it. And if this,
which you give as the Key, that opens to
the interpretation that I should have made,
be so hard to be found, the interpretation
it self could not be so very <hi>easie</hi> as you speak
of.</p>
            <p>But to avoid all blame for understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Passage as I did, and to secure my
self from being suspected to seek a subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
in the natural import of your Words,
against what might be conjectur'd to be your
Sense, I added.<note n="†" place="margin">Letter 2 p. 45.</note> 
               <q>But if by any new
way of Construction, unintelligible to
me, the word <hi>Them</hi> here shall be applied
to any Passages of my <hi>Essay of Humane
Vnderstanding;</hi> I must humbly crave leave
to observe this one Thing, in the whole
course of what your Lordship had design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for my <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> That tho' my
Complaint be of your Lordship's <hi>manner
of applying,</hi> what I had publish'd in my
<hi>Essay,</hi> so as to interest me in a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
wherein I medled not; yet your
Lordship all along tells me of others,
that have <hi>misapplied</hi> I know not what
Words in my Book, after I know not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65912:52"/>
what <hi>manner.</hi> Now as to this Matter,
I beseech your Lordship to believe that
when any one, in such a manner applies
my Words contrary to what I intended
them, so as to make them opposite to the
Doctrin of the Trinity; and me a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in that Controversie against the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as your Lordship knows I complain
your Lordship has done, I shall complain
of them too; and consider, as well as I
can, what <hi>Satisfaction</hi> they give me and
others in it.</q> This Passage of mine your
Lordship here<note n="*" place="margin">p. 17.</note> represents thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That
I say, That if by an unintelligible new way
of Construction, the word <hi>Them</hi> be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to any Passages in my Book: <hi>What then?
Why then, whoever they are,</hi> I intend to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of them too. <hi>But,</hi> says your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<hi>the Words just before tell me who they are,</hi>
viz. <hi>The Enemies of the Christian Faith.</hi> And
then your Lordship Asks, <hi>whether this be all
that I intend,</hi> viz. only to Complain of them
<hi>for making me</hi> a Party in the Controversie
against the Trinity?</p>
            <p>My Lord, were I given to <hi>Chicaning,</hi>
as you call my being stop'd by Faults of
Grammar that disturb the Sense, and make
the Discourse incoherent and unintelligible,
if we are to take it from the Words as they
are, I should not want Matter enough for
such an Exercise of my Pen: As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
here again<note n="*" place="margin">p. 17.</note>, where your Lordship
makes me say, <hi>That</hi> if the word <hi>Them</hi> be
applied to any Passages in my Book, <hi>then
whoever <hi>They</hi> are, I intend to Complain,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65912:52"/>
These being set down for my Words, I
would be very glad to be able to put them
into a Grammatical construction, and make
to my self an intelligible Sense of them. But
<hi>They</hi> being not a Word that I have an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Power over, to place where and for
what I will, I confess I cannot do it. For
the term <hi>They</hi> in the Words here, as your
Lordship has set them down, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that it can refer to but <hi>Passages,</hi> or
<hi>them</hi> which stands for Words, it must be
a very suddain metamorphosis that must
change them into Persons, for 'tis for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that the word <hi>They</hi> stands here; and
yet I crave leave to say, that as far as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
English, <hi>They</hi> is a Word cannot
be used without reference to something
mentioned before. Your Lordship tells me
<hi>the Words just before tell me who they are.</hi> The
Words just mentioned <hi>before</hi> are these, <hi>if
by an unintelligible new way of Construction the
word <hi>Them</hi> be applied to any Passage of my Book,</hi>
for 'tis to some words <hi>before</hi> indeed, but
<hi>before</hi> in the same contexture of Discourse,
that the word <hi>They</hi> must refer to make it
any where intelligible. But here are no
Persons mentioned in <hi>the Words just before,</hi>
though your Lordship tells me the <hi>Words
just before</hi> shew <hi>who they are,</hi> but this <hi>just
before,</hi> where the Persons are mentioned
whom your Lordship intends by <hi>They</hi> here,
is so far off that 16 Pages of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
second Letter, 174 Pages of my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Letter, and above 100 Pages of your
Lordships first Letter come between: So
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65912:53"/>
that one must read above 280 Pages from
<hi>the Enemies of the Christian Faith,</hi> in the 37th
Page of your first Letter, before one can
come to the <hi>They</hi> which refers to them
here in the 17th Page of your Lordship's
second Letter.</p>
            <p>My Lord, 'tis my misfortune that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pretend to any Figure amongst the
Men of Learning; but I would not for that
reason be render'd so despicable, that I
could not write ordinary Sense in my own
Language: I must beg leave therefore to
inform my Reader, that what your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
has set down here as mine, is neither
my Words, nor my Sense. For,</p>
            <p>1. I say not, if by any <hi>unintelligible new
way of Construction;</hi> But I say, <q>If by any
new way of Construction unintelligible
to me:</q> Which are far different Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
For that may be very intelligible to
others, which may be unintelligible to me.
And indeed my Lord, there are so many
Passages in your Writings in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
with me, which for their Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as well as otherwise, are so unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to me, that if I should be so unmannerly,
as to measure your Understanding by mine,
I should not know what to think of them.
In those cases therefore, I presume not to
go beyond my own Capacity: I tell your
Lordship often (which I hope Modesty will
permit) what my weak Understanding will
not reach; but I am far from saying it is
therefore absolutely <hi>unintelligible.</hi> I leave
to others the benefit of their better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65912:53"/>
to be enlightened by your Lordship,
where I am not.</p>
            <p>2. The use your Lordship here makes
of these Words, <q>But if by any new way
of Construction unintelligible to me,
the word <hi>Them</hi> be applied to any Passages
in my Book:</q> Is not the principal nor the
only (as your Lordship makes it) use for
which I said them. But this; That if your
Lordship by <hi>Them</hi> in that place, were to
be understood to mean, that there were
others that misapplied Passages of my Book;
this was no satisfaction for what your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
had done in that kind. Though this
I observed was your way of defence; That
when I complained of what your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
had done, you told me, that others
had done so too: As if that could be any
manner of Satisfaction. I added in the
close,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Letter p. 46.</note> 
               <q>That when any one, in such a
manner applies my Words contrary to
what I intended them, so as to make them
opposite to the Doctrin of the Trinity,
and me a Party in that Controversie
against the Trinity, as your Lordship
knows I complain your Lordship has
done, I shall complain of them too; and
consider as well as I can, what <hi>Satisfaction</hi>
they give me and others in it.</q> Of this
<hi>any one</hi> of mine, your Lordship makes your
forementioned <hi>They,</hi> whether with any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Sense or clearness to my Words,
the Reader must judge. However this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of that Passage, with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
turn your Lordship gives to it, is what
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65912:54"/>
your Words would perswade your Reader
is all that I say here: Would not your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
upon such an occasion from me, cry
out again, <hi>Is this fair and ingenuous Dealing?</hi>
And would not you think you had reason
to do so? But let us see what we must
guess your Lordship makes me say, and your
exceptions to it.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship makes me say, <hi>whoever
they are,</hi> who misapply my Words, as I
complain your Lordship has done (for these
Words must be supplied to make the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to me intelligible) <hi>I intend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of them too:</hi> And then you find fault
with me for using the indefinite word <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi>
and as a Reproof for the unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it, you say; <hi>But the Words just before
tell me who they are.</hi> But my Words are not
<hi>whoever they are.</hi> But my Words are,
<q>When any one in such a manner applies
my Words contrary to what I intended
them, &amp;c.</q> Your Lordship would here
have me understand, that there are those
that have done it, and Rebukes me that I
speak as if I knew not any one, that had done
it, and that I may not plead Ignorance,
you say your <hi>Words just before, told me who
they were,</hi> viz. <hi>The Enemies of the Christian
Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What must I do now, to keep my Word
and satisfie your Lordship? Must I complain
of <hi>the Enemies of the Christian Faith</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that they have applied my Words as
aforesaid, and then consider as well as I can,
what Satisfaction they give me and others
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65912:54"/>
in it? For that was all I promised to do.
But this would be strange to complain of
<hi>the Enemies</hi> of the Christian Faith, for doing,
what 'tis very likely they never all did, and
what I do not know that any one of them
has done. Or must I to content your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
read over all the writings <hi>of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Christian Faith,</hi> to see whether
any one of them has applied my Words, <hi>i. e.</hi>
in such a manner as I complained your
Lordship has done, that if they have, I may
complain of them too? This truly my
Lord, is more than I have time for; and if it
were worth while, when it is done, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
I should not content your Lordship in
it. For you ask me here, <hi>Is this all I intend,
only to complain of them for making me a Party
in the Controversie against the Trinity?</hi> No
my Lord, this is not all. I promised too,
<q>To consider as well as I can what Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
(if they offer any) they give me
and others for so doing.</q> And why should
not this content your Lordship in reference
to others as well as it does in reference to
your self? I have but one measure for your
Lordship and others. When others treat
me after the manner you have done, why
should it not be enough to answer them after
the same manner I have done your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?
But perhaps your Lordship has some
dextrous meaning under this, which I am
not quick sighted enough to perceive, and
so do not reply right, as you would have
me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:65912:55"/>
I must beg my Readers Pardon as well
as your Lordships, for using so many Words
about Passages, that seem not in themselves
of that importance. I confess, that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
they are not: But yet 'tis my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
that in this Controversie, your
way of writing and representing my Sense
forces me to it.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's name in writing is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
above controle, and therefore
'twould be ill breeding in one, who barely
reads what you write, not to take every
thing for perfect in its kind, which your
Lordship says. Clearness and Force and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
are to be presumed always, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
your Lordship's Words be: And there
is no other Remedy for an Answerer, who
finds it difficult any where to come at your
Meaning or Argument, but to make his
Excuse for it, in laying the particulars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Reader, that he may be Judge
where the Fault lies; especially where any
matter of Fact is contested, deductions from
the first rise, are often necessary, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made in few Words, nor without
several Repetitions: An inconvenience possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
fitter to be endured, than that your
Lordship, in the run of your Learned No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
should be Shackled with the ordinary
and strict Rules of Language, and in the
delivery of your sublimer Speculations, be
tied down to the mean and contemptible
rudiments of Grammar: Though your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above these and freed from a servile ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
in the use of trivial <hi>Particles,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65912:55"/>
the connection of Discourse chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
cannot but cause great difficulties
to the Reader. And however it may be an
ease to any great Man, to find himself above
the ordinary rules of Writing, he who is
bound to follow the connection and find out
his Meaning, will have his Task much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by it.</p>
            <p>I am very sensible how much this has swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
these Papers already, and yet I do not
see, how any thing less than what I have
said could clear those Passages, which we
have hitherto examined; and set them in
their due Light.</p>
            <p>Your next Words are these,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 17.</note> 
               <hi>But whether
I have not made my self too much a Party in it,</hi>
[<hi>i. e.</hi> the Controversie against the Trinity]
<hi>will appear before we have done.</hi> This is an
<hi>Item</hi> for me, which your Lordship seems
so very fond of, and so careful to inculcate,
wherever you bring in any Words it can
be tacked to, that if one can avoid thinking
it to be the main end of your writing, one
cannot yet but see, that it could not be so
much in the Thoughts and Words of a
great Man, who is above such <hi>personal Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and which he knows <hi>the World soon
grows weary of,</hi> unless it had some very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
business there. Whether it be the
Author that has prejudiced you against his
Book, or the Book prejudiced you against
the Author, so it is I perceive, that both
I, and my <hi>Essay</hi> are fallen under your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:65912:56"/>
I am not unacquainted what great stress
is often laid upon invidious Names by
skilful Disputants to supply the want of
better Arguments. But give me leave,
my Lord, to say, That 'tis too late for
me now to begin to value those marks
of good Will, or a good Cause; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall say nothing more to them, as
fitter to be left to the examination of the
Thoughts within your own breast, from
what sourse such reasonings spring, and
whither they tend.</p>
            <p>I am going, my Lord, to a Tribunal that
has a right to judge of Thoughts, and being
secure that I there shall be found of no
<hi>Party</hi> but that of Truth (for which there
is required nothing but the receiving Truth
in the Love of it) I matter not much of
what <hi>Party</hi> any one shall, as may best serve
his turn, denominate me here. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
is not the first Pen from which I
have receiv'd such strokes as these without
any great harm: I never found freedom of
Stile did me any hurt with those who knew
me, and if those who know me not will
take up borrowed Prejudices, it will be more
to their own harm than mine: So that in
this, I shall give your Lordship little other
Trouble, but my Thanks sometimes, where
I find you skilfully and industriously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
me to the World under the
Character you have chosen for me. Only
give me leave to say. That if the <hi>Essay</hi> I shall
leave behind me hath no other fault to sink
it but Heresie and <hi>inconsistency with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65912:56"/>
of the Christian Faith,</hi> I am apt to think
it will last in the World, and do service
to Truth, even the Truths of Religion,
notwithstanding that imputation laid on it
by so mighty a hand as your Lordships's.</p>
            <p>In your two next Paragraphs<note n="*" place="margin">p. 18, 19,</note> your
Lordship accuses me of <hi>Cavilling</hi> in the 43d
and 44th Pages of my second Letter,
whither for shortness I refer my Reader.
I shall only add, That though <hi>in the Debate
about Mysteries of Faith,</hi> your Adversaries
as you say <hi>are not Heathens;</hi> yet any one
among us, whom your Lordship should
speak of as not <hi>owning the Scripture to be
the Foundation and Rule of Faith,</hi> would I
presume be thought to receive from you a
Character very little different from that
of a <hi>Heathen.</hi> Which being a part of your
Complement to me, will I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
excuse what I there said, from being
a <hi>Cavilling exception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto your Lordship, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>you understood the World so well,</hi> has
imploied your Pen in <hi>Personal Matters,</hi> how
unacceptable soever to the World you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it to be; How must I behave my self
in the Case? If I answer nothing, my si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is so apt to be interpreted guilt or
concession, that even the deferring my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to some Points, or not giving it in
the <hi>proper place</hi> is reflected on as no small
Trangression; whereof there are two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
in the two following Pages.<note n="*" place="margin">20, 21.</note> And
if I do answer so at large, as your way
of writing requires, and as the matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65912:57"/>
I recall to your memory <hi>the Springs
of</hi> Modena, <hi>by the Ebullition of my Thoughts.</hi>
'Tis hard, my Lord, between these two to
manage ones self to your good likeing:
However, I shall endeavour to collect the
force of your reasonings, where-ever I can
find it, as short as I can, and apply my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to that, though with the omission of
a great many incidents deserving to be
taken notice of: If my flowness, not able
to keep pace every where with your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
Flights, shall have missed any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
whereon you lay any stress; if you
please to point it out to me, I shall not
fail to endeavour to give you satisfaction
therein.</p>
            <p>In the next Paragraph<note n="*" place="margin">p. 19.</note> your Lordship
says, <hi>Those who are not sparing of writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Articles of Faith, and among them take
great care to avoid some which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
esteemed Fundamental,</hi> &amp;c. This seems
also to contain something <hi>Personal</hi> in it.
But how far I am concerned in it I shall
know, when you shall be pleased to tell me
who <hi>those</hi> are, and then it will be time
enough for me to answer.</p>
            <p>This is what your Lordship has brought
in under your second Answer in these four
Pages as a defence of it, and how much of
it is a defence of that second Answer, let
the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>I am now come<note n="†" place="margin">p. 20.</note> to the (3d) of those
Answers, which you said, <hi>p.</hi> 7. you would
<hi>lay together and defend.</hi> And it is this:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:65912:57"/>
That my Grounds of Certainty tend to Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism,
and that in an Age wherein the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Faith are too much exposed by the
promoters of Scepticism and Infidelity; it is
a thing of dangerous consequence to start such
new methods of Certainty as are apt to leave
Mens Minds more doubtful than before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is what you set down here to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
the defence follows, wherein your
Lordship tells me</hi> that I say, <q>
                  <hi>These Words
contain a farther Accusation of my Book,
which shall be consider'd in its due
place.</hi>
               </q> But <hi>this is</hi> the proper place of
considering it: <hi>For</hi> your Lordship said, That
hereby I have given too just occasion to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Christian Faith, to make use of
my Words and Notions, as was evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from my own Concessions. And if this be
so, however you were willing to have had me
explained my self to the general Satisfaction;
yet, since I decline it, you do insist upon it,
That I cannot clear my self from laying that
Foundation, which the Author of <hi>Christianity
not Mysterious</hi> built upon.</p>
            <p>In which I crave leave to acquaint your
Lordship with what I do not understand.</p>
            <p>First, I do not understand what is meant
by <hi>this is <hi>the proper place;</hi>
               </hi> for in ordinary
construction, these Words seem to denote
this 20th Page of your Lordship's second
Letter, which you were then writing, tho'
the sense would make me think the 46th
Page of my second Letter which you were
then answering should be meant. This
perhaps your Lordship may think a <hi>nice
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65912:58"/>
piece of Criticism;</hi> but till it be cleared, I
cannot tell what to say in my excuse. For
'tis likely your Lordship would again ask
me, whether I could think you a <hi>Man of
so little Sense,</hi> If I should understand these
Words to mean the 20th Page of your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Letter, which no body can conceive
your Lordship should think a <hi>proper place</hi>
for me to consider and answer what you
had writ in your first? 'Twould be as hard
to understand <hi>this is,</hi> to mean a place in
my former Letter, which was past and
done; but 'tis no wonder for me to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in your priviledge word <hi>this.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
there is this farther difficulty to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<hi>this is the proper place,</hi> of the 46th
Page of my former Letter, because I do
not see why the 82d Page of that Letter,
where I did consider and answer it, was
not as proper place of <hi>considering</hi> it as the
46th, where I give a reason why I defend
it. Farther, if I understood what you
meant here by <hi>this is the proper place,</hi> I should
possibly apprehend better the force of your
Argument subjoined to prove <hi>this</hi> whatever
it be, to be the <hi>proper place;</hi> the causal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<hi>For,</hi> which introduces the following
Words, making them a reason of those
preceding. But in the present obscurity
of this matter, I confess I do not see how
your having <hi>said that I gave occasion to the
Enemies of the Christian Faith,</hi> &amp;c. proves
any thing concerning <hi>the proper place</hi> at
all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:65912:58"/>
Another thing that I do not understand
in this Defence, is your inference in the
next Period, where you tell me, <hi>If this be
so, you insist upon it that I should clear my
self.</hi> For I do not see how your having
said what you there said (for that is it
which <hi>this</hi> here, if it be not within Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
must signifie) can be a reason for
your insisting on my <hi>clearing</hi> my self of any
thing, though I allow this to be your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
ordinary way of proceding to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon your suggestions and suppositions
in one place, as if they were Foundations
to build what you pleased on in another.</p>
            <p>Thus then stands your defence, <hi>My
Grounds of Certainty tend to Scepticism, and
to start new Methods of Certainty is of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
consequence.</hi> Because I did not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this your Accusation <hi>in the proper place of
considering it. This is the proper place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
it.</hi> Because your Lordship <hi>said I
had given too just occasion to the Enemies of
the Christian Faith to make use of my Words
and Notions;</hi> and because your Lordship
<hi>said</hi> so, therefore <hi>you insist upon it that I
clear my self,</hi> &amp;c. This appears to me, to
be the connection and force of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
hitherto. If I am mistaken in it,
your Lordship's Words are set down, the
Reader must judge whether the construction
of the Words do not make it so.</p>
            <p>But before I leave them, there are some
things that I crave permission to represent
to your Lordship more particularly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:65912:59"/>
1. That to the Accusation of <hi>Scepticism,</hi>
I have answer'd in another, and as I think,
a <hi>proper place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That the Accusation of <hi>dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence</hi>
I have consider'd and answer'd in
my former Letter<note n="*" place="margin">2 Let. p. 82-95. 109.</note>; but that being it seems
not the <hi>proper place of considering it,</hi> you have
not in this your Defence thought fit to
take any notice of it.</p>
            <p>3. That your Lordship has not any where
proved, That my placing of Certainty in
the perception of the Agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Ideas <hi>is apt to leave Mens
Minds more doubtful than they were before,</hi>
which is what your Accusation supposes.</p>
            <p>4. That you set down those Words of
mine, <q>These Words contain a farther
Accusation of my Book, which shall be
consider'd in its due place,</q> as all the
answer which I gave to that new Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
except what you take notice of out
of my 95th Page; and take no notice
of what I say from Page 82 to 95. where I
consider'd it as I promised, and as I thought
fully answer'd it.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>That the too</hi> just occasion, <hi>you say,</hi> I
have given to the Enemies of the Christian
Faith to make use of my Words and Notions,
<hi>wants to be proved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>That what</hi> use the Enemies of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith have made of my Words and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>is no where shewn though often talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:65912:59"/>
7. That if <hi>the Enemies of the Christian
Faith have made use of my Words and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
yet that, as I have shewn<note n="†" place="margin">2d Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter p. 69 &amp; 85.</note>, is no
proof, That they are of dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
Much less is it a proof, that this
Proposition, <q>Certainty consists in the
perception of the agreement or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ideas, is <hi>of dangerous consequence.</hi>
               </q> 
For some <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Notions</hi> in a Book, that
are of <hi>dangerous consequence,</hi> do not make all
the Propositions of that Book to be <hi>of
dangerous consequence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. That your Lordship tells me, <hi>You were
willing to have had me explained my self to
the general satisfaction,</hi> which is what in the
place<note n="*" place="margin">1st Ans. p. 37.</note> from which the former words are
taken, you expressed thus, That <hi>my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
did not come fully up in all things to that
which you coùld wish.</hi> To which I have given
an answer;<note n="†" place="margin">2d Let. p. 38-41.</note> and methinks your defence
here should have been applied to that, and
not the same thing (which has been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd)
set down again as part of your
<hi>Defence.</hi> But pray, my Lord, give me
leave to ask, is not this meant for a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Matter,</hi> which though the <hi>World,</hi> as
you say, <hi>is soon weary of,</hi> your Lordship, it
seems is not?</p>
            <p>9. That you say, <hi>You insist upon it that I
cannot clear my self from laying that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
which the Author of</hi> Christianity not
Mysterious <hi>built upon.</hi> Certainly this <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Matter</hi> is of some very great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that your Lordship, who <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
the World so well, insists</hi> so much <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65912:60"/>
it.</hi> But if it be true, That <hi>he built upon
my Foundation;</hi> and it be of such moment
to your Lordships business in the present
Controversie, methinks without so much
intricacy it should not be hard to shew it:
It is but proving what <hi>Foundation</hi> of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
(for 'tis of that all this dispute is)
he went upon, which, as I humbly conceive,
your Lordship has not done; and then
shewing that to be my <hi>Foundation</hi> of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
and the business is ended. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of this your Lordship says,<note place="margin">Vindic. p. 232.</note> That <hi>his
account of Reason <hi>supposes</hi> clear and distinct
Ideas necessary to Certainty;</hi> That he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
<hi>he built upon my Grounds;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Answ. p. 36.</note> That <hi>he
<hi>thought</hi>
               </hi> his and my <hi>Notions</hi> of Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>to be the same; That there has been</hi> too
iust occasion <hi>given, for the Enemies of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith to apply my Words</hi> in I know not
what <hi>manner.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ib. p. 37.</note> These and the like Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove that he goes <hi>upon my Grounds</hi>
your Lordship has used; but they are, I
confess, too subtile and too fine for me to
feel the force of them, in a Matter of Fact
wherein it was so easie to produce both his
and my Grounds out of our Books (without
all this talk about Suppositions and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Occasions so far remote from any
direct Proof) if it were a matter of that
consequence to be so <hi>insisted upon</hi> as your
Lordship professedly does.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship has spent a great <hi>many
Pages</hi> to tie me to that Author; and you
still <hi>insist upon it, that I cannot clear my self
from laying that Foundation which the Author
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65912:60"/>
of</hi> Christianity not Mysterious <hi>built upon.</hi>
What this great concern in a matter of so
little moment means, I leave the Reader to
guess: For, I beseech your Lordship, of
what great consequence is it to the World?
What great interest has any Truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in this, That I and another Man (be
he who he will) make use of the same
Grounds to different purposes? This I am
sure, it tends not to the clearing, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
any one material Truth in the
World. If the <hi>Foundation</hi> I have <hi>laid</hi> be
true, I shall neither disown nor dislike it,
whatever this or any other Author shall
<hi>build</hi> upon it; because, as your Lordship
knows, ill things may be built upon a
good Foundation, and yet the Foundation
never the worse for it. And therefore if
that, or any other Author hath <hi>built upon
my Foundation,</hi> I see nothing in it, that I
ought to be concerned to <hi>clear my self
from.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you can shew that my <hi>Foundation</hi> is
false, or shew me a better Foundation of
Certainty than mine, I promise you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to renounce and relinquish mine
with thanks to your Lordship: But till you
can prove, That he that first invented Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme
as a Rule of right Reasoning, or
first laid down this Principle, That it is
impossible for the same thing to be and
not to be, is answerable for all those Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
which have been endeavoured to
be proved by Mode and Figure; or have
been built upon that Maxim, I shall not
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65912:61"/>
think my self concerned, whatever any one
shall <hi>build upon</hi> this <hi>Foundation</hi> of mine, That
Certainty consists in the perception of the
agreement or disagreement of any two Ideas
as they are expressed in any Proposition;
much less shall I think my self concerned,
for what you shall please to <hi>suppose</hi> (for that,
with submission, is all you have done hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto)
any one has <hi>built upon it,</hi> though
he were never so opposite to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in any of the Opinions he should build
on it.</p>
            <p>In that case, if he should prove trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to your Lordship with any Argument
pretended to be <hi>built upon my Foundation,</hi> I
humbly conceive you have no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
but to shew either the <hi>Foundation</hi>
false, and in that case I confess my self
concerned; or his deduction from it wrong,
and that I shall not be at all concerned in.
But if instead of this, your Lordship shall
find no other way to subvert this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Certainty, but by saying, The <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Christian Faith build on it,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you suppose one Author <hi>builds on it;</hi>
this I fear, my Lords, will very little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
the Cause you defend, whilst it so
visibly strengthens, and gives credit to your
Adversaries, rather than weakens any Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
they go upon. For the <hi>Vnitarians</hi>
I imagine, will be apt to smile, at such a
way of arguing, <hi>viz.</hi> That they go on this
Ground, because the Author of <hi>Christianity
not Mysterious</hi> goes upon it, or is supposed
by your Lordship to go upon it; and By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65912:61"/>
will do little less than Smile, to
find my Book brought into the <hi>Socinian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
and the ground of Certainty laid
down in my <hi>Essay</hi> condemned, only because
that Author is supposed by your Lordship
to <hi>build</hi> upon it. For this in short is the
Case, and this the way your Lordship has
used in <hi>answering Objections against the Trinity
in point of Reason.</hi> I know your Lordship
cannot be suspected of writing booty: But
I fear, such a way of arguing in so great a
Man as your Lordship, will <hi>in an Age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Mysteries of Faith are too much exposed,
give too just an occasion to the Enemies,</hi> and
also to the Friends <hi>of the Christian Faith,</hi> to
suspect that there is a great failure some
where.</p>
            <p>But to pass by that. This I am sure is
<hi>personal Matter,</hi> which the World perhaps
will think it need not have been troubled
with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Defence of your third Answer goes
on, and to prove, that</hi> the Author of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
not Mysterious built upon my Foundation,
<hi>you tell me,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 20. 21.</note> That my ground of Certainty
is <hi>the agreement or disagreement of the
Ideas, as expressed in any Proposition.</hi>
Which are my own Words. From hence you
urged, That let the Proposition come to us any
way, either by humane or divine Authority,
if our Certainty depend upon this, we can be no
more certain, than we have clear perception of
the agreement or disagreement of Ideas contained
in it. And from hence the Author of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
not Mysterious, thought he had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65912:62"/>
to reject all Mysteries of Faith, which are
contained in Propositions, upon my grounds of
Certainty.</p>
            <p>Since this <hi>personal Matter</hi> appears of such
weight to your Lordship, that it needs to
be farther Prosecuted; and you think this
your Argument to prove, That <hi>that Author
built upon my Foundation,</hi> worth the repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here again; I am oblieged to enter
again, so far into this <hi>personal Matter,</hi> as to
examine this Passage which I formerly passed
by as of no Moment. For it is easy to shew,
that what you say, visibly proves not, that
he built upon my Foundation; and next
'tis evident, that if it were proved, that he
did so, yet this is no Proof, that my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Certainty is <hi>of dangerous Consequence,</hi>
which is what was to be defended.</p>
            <p>As to the first of these, your Lordship
would prove, that the Author of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
not Mysterious built upon my Ground,
and how do you prove it? <hi>viz.</hi> because <hi>he
thought he had Reason to reject all Mysteries of
Faith, which are contained in Propositions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my Ground.</hi> How does it appear, that
<hi>he rejected them upon my Grounds?</hi> Does he
any where say so? No! That is not offered,
there is no need of such an Evidence of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact, in a case which is only of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact. But <hi>he thought he had Reason to
reject them upon my Grounds of Certainty.</hi> How
does it appear that he thought so? Very
plainly. Because, <hi>let the Proposition come to
us by humane or Divine Authority, if our Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
depend upon the perception of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65912:62"/>
or disagreement of the Ideas contained in
it, we can be no more certain than we have clear
perception of that agreement.</hi> The consequence
I grant is good, that if Certainty, <hi>i. e.</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
consists in the perception of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or disagreement of Ideas, then we
can certainly know the Truth of no Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
further than we perceive that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or disagreement. But how does it
follow from thence, that he <hi>Thought he had
Reason upon my Grounds to reject</hi> any Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
that contained a Mystery of Faith:
Or, as your Lordship expresses it, <hi>all My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Faith which are contained in Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether your Lordship by the word <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting</hi>
accuses him of not knowing, or of not
believing some Proposition, that contains
an Article of Faith; or what he has done or
not done I concern not my self; that which
I deny is the consequence above mentioned,
which I submit to your Lordship to be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And when you have proved it, and
shewn your self to be so familiar with the
Thoughts of that Author, as to be able to
be positive, what he Thought, without his
telling you, it will remain farther to be
proved, that because he thought so, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he built right upon my Foundation, for
otherwise no prejudice will come to my
Foundation by any ill use he made of it; nor
will it be made good, that my method or
way of Certainty, is <hi>of dangerous Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi>
which is what your Lordship is here
to <hi>defend.</hi> Methinks your Lordship's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65912:63"/>
here is all one with this. <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s
ground of Certainty (except of first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples)
lies in this, That those things which
agree in a Third agree themselves. We
can be certain of no Proposition (excepting
first Principles) coming to us either by divine
or humane Authority, if our Certainty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon this, farther than there is such
an agreement. Therefore the Author of
Christianity not Mysterious thought he had
reason to reject all Mysteries of Faith, which
are contained in Propositions upon <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s
Grounds. This consequence as strange as
it is, is just the same with what is in your
Lordship's repeated Argument against me.
For let <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s ground of Certainty be
this, that I have named, or what it will,
How does it follow, that because my ground
of Certainty is placed in the agreement or
disagreement of Ideas, therefore the Author
of Christianity not Mysterious rejected any
Proposition more upon my Grounds than
<hi>Aristotle</hi>'s? And will not <hi>Aristotle</hi> by your
Lordship's way of Arguing here, from the
use any one may make or think he makes of
it, be guilty also of <hi>starting a method of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of dangerous consequence,</hi> whether his
method be True or False, if that or any
other Author whose writings you dislike,
thought he built upon it, or be supposed
by your Lordship to think so. But, as
I humbly conceive, Propositions, specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Propositions such as mine is, about
which all this stir is made, are to be judg'd
of by their Truth or Falshood, and not by
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65912:63"/>
the use any one shall make of them; much
less by the Persons who are supposed to
<hi>build on</hi> them. And therefore it may be
justly wonder'd, since you say it is <hi>dangerous,</hi>
why you never proved or attempted to
prove it to be false.</p>
            <p>But you complain here again, that I <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
not a Word to this in the proper Place.</hi>
My Lord, if I offended your Lordship, by
passing it by, because I thought there was
no Argument in it: I hope I have now given
you some sort of Satisfaction, by shewing
there is no Argument in it; and letting you
see, that your consequence here could not
be infer'd from your antecedent. If
you think it may, I desire you to try it
in a Syllogism. For whatever you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to say in another place<note n="†" place="margin">p. 120.</note> my way of
Certainty by Ideas will admit of <hi>Antecedents</hi>
and <hi>Consequents</hi> and of <hi>Syllogism</hi> as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
form to try whether the Inference be
right or no. I shall set down your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Words, that the Reader may see
your Lordship's manner of Reasoning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this matter in its full force and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency,
and try it in a <hi>Syllogism</hi> if he pleases.
Your Words are<note n="*" place="margin">p. 21.</note>,</p>
            <p>By this it evidently appears, that although your
Lordship was willing to allow me all fair ways
of interpreting my own Sense; yet you by no
means Thought, that my Words were wholy
<hi>misunderstood</hi> or <hi>misapplied</hi> by that Author:
But rather that he saw into the true consequence
of them, as they lie in my Book. And what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65912:64"/>
do I give to this? Not a Word in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place for it.</p>
            <p>You tell me, you <hi>were willing to allow me
all fair ways of interpreting my own Sense.</hi> If
your Lordship had been conscious to your
self, that you had herein meant me any
kindness, I think I may presume, you would
not have minded me here again of a Favour,
which you had told me of but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Page, and to make it an Obligation,
need not have been more than once talked
of; unless your Lordship thought the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
was such, that it would hardly be
seen, unless I were told of it in words at
length, and in more places than one. For
what Favour I beseech you, my Lord, is
it, to <hi>allow</hi> me to do that, which needed not
your allowance to be done, and I could have
done (if it had been necessary) of my self
without being blamed for taking that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Whatsoever therefore your meaning
was in these Words, I cannot think you
took this way to make me sensible of your
Kindness.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship says, you <hi>were willing to
allow me to interpret my own Sense.</hi> What you
were willing to allow me to do, I have done.
My Sense is, that Certainty consists in the
perception of the agreement or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ideas; and my Sense therein I have
interpreted to be the agreement or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not only of perfectly clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Ideas, but such Ideas, as we have,
whether they be in all their parts perfectly
clear and distinct or no. Farther in answer
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65912:64"/>
to your Objection, that it might be <hi>of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Consequence:</hi> I so explained my Sense,
as to shew, that Certainty in that Sense was
not, nor could be of <hi>dangerous Consequence.</hi>
This, which was the Point in question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, your Lordship might have found
at large explain'd in 82d and ten or twelve
following Pages of my second Letter, if
you had been pleased to have taken notice
of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it seems you were more willing to
tell me,</hi> That though you were willing to allow
me all ways of interpreting my own Sense, <hi>yet</hi>
you by no means thought, that my Words were
wholy misunderstood or misapply'd by that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
but rather that he saw into the true conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of them as they lie in my Book. <hi>I shall
here set down your Lordship's Words</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 35.</note>
               <hi>where to</hi> give me and others Satisfaction) <hi>you
say,</hi> you took care to prevent being misunderstood,
which will best appear by your own Words, <hi>viz.</hi>
That you must doe that right to the ingenious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Essay of Humane Vnderstanding,
from whom these Notions are borrowed to serve
other purposes than he intended them. It was
too plain, that the bold Writer against the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of our Faith took his Notions and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
from thence, and what could be said
more for my Vindication, than that he turned
them to other purposes than the Author intended
them? <hi>This you endeavour to prove,</hi> p.
43-46 <hi>and then conclude</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 46.</note> By which it is
sufficiently proved, that you had Reason to say,
that my Notion was carried beyond my Intention.
<hi>These Words out of your first Letter, I
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65912:65"/>
shall leave here, set by those out of your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
that you may at your leisure, if you
think fit (for it will not become me to tell
your Lordship that I am</hi> willing to allow it) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
your self to the general Satisfaction, <hi>that it
may be known which of them is now your
Sense; for they are, I suppose, too much to
be together any ones Sense at the same time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Intention</hi> being thus so well vindicated
by your Lordship, that you think<note n="*" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 36.</note> nothing
<hi>could be said more for my Vindication,</hi> the
misunderstanding or not misunderstanding
of my Book, by that or any other Author,
is what I shall not wast my time about. If
your Lordship thinks he <hi>saw into the true
Consequence</hi> of this Position of mine, that
Certainty consists in the perception of the
agreement or disagreement of Ideas (for 'tis
from the inference, that you suppose he
makes from that my definition of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that you are here proving it to be
of dangerous Consequence) he is beholding
to your Lordship for your good Opinion of
his quick Sight: I take no part in that, one
way or other. What consequences your
Lordship's quick Sight (which must be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have out-done, what you suppose of
that Gentleman's) has found and charged on
that Notion as dangerous, I shall endeavour
to give you Satisfaction in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You farther add,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 21.</note> 
               <hi>that though</hi> I answer'd
not a Word in the proper Place, yet afterwards,
<hi>Let. 2. p.</hi> 95. (for you would omit nothing,
that may seem to help my Cause) I offer some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
towards an Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:65912:65"/>
I shall be at a loss hereafter, what to do
with the 82d and following Pages to the
95th, since what is said in those Pages of
my second Letter, goes for nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is not in its <hi>proper Place.</hi> Though
if any one will give himself the trouble to
look into my second Letter, he will find,
that the Argument I was upon in the 46th
Page, obliged me to defer, what I had far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to say to your new Accusation. But
that I re-assumed it in the 82d, and answer'd
it in that and the following Pages.</p>
            <p>But supposing every Writer had not that
exactness of Method, which shew'd, by the
natural and visible connection of the parts
of his Discourse, that every thing was laid
in its proper place, is it a sufficient Answer
not to take any notice of it? The Reason
why I put this Question is, because if this
be a Rule in Controversie, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
I might have passed over the greatest
part of what your Lordship has said to me,
because the Disposition it has under numerical
Figures, is so far from giving me a view
of the orderly connection of the parts of
your Discourse, that I have often been
tempted to suspect the negligence of the
Printer for misplacing your Lordship's Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
since so ranked as they are, they do
to me, who am confounded by them, lose
all Order and Connection quite.</p>
            <p>The next thing in the Defence, which
you go on with, is an exception to my use
of the word <hi>Certainty.</hi> In the close of
the Answer I had made in the Pages you
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65912:66"/>
pass over<note n="*" place="margin">2 Letter p. 95.</note> I add, that, <q>Though the
Laws of Disputation allow bare denial,
as a sufficient Answer to Sayings without
any offer of a Proof; yet my Lord, to
shew how willing I am to give your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
all Satisfaction, in what you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
may be of <hi>dangerous Consequence</hi> in
my Book, as to <hi>that Article,</hi> I shall not
stand still sullenly, and put your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
upon the difficulty of shewing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that Danger lies; but shall on the other
side endeavour to shew your Lordship,
That that Definition of mine, whether
True or False, Right or Wrong, can be
of no <hi>dangerous Consequence to that Article
of Faith.</hi> The Reason which I shall offer
for it is this; because it can be of no
Consequence to it at all.</q>.And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it was clear from what I had said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<note n="†" place="margin">2 Letter p. 90.</note> That <hi>Knowing</hi> and <hi>Believing</hi> were
Two different Acts of the Mind. And that
my placing of <hi>Certainty</hi> in the perception of
the agreement or disagreement of Ideas, <hi>i. e.</hi>
that my Definition of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> one of
those Acts of the Mind, would not at all
alter or shake the Definition of <hi>Faith,</hi> which
was another Act of the Mind distinct from
it. And therefore I added,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Letter p. 95.</note> 
               <q>That the
<hi>Certainty of Faith</hi> (if your Lordship thinks
fit to call it so) has nothing to do with
the <hi>Certainty of Knowledge.</hi> And to talk
of the <hi>Certainty of Faith,</hi> seems all one to
me, as to talk of the Knowledge of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving;
a way of Speaking not easy to
me to understand.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:65912:66"/>
These and other Words to this purpose
in the following Paragraphs, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
lays hold on, and sets down, as liable to
no small exception: Though as you tell<note n="†" place="margin">p. 23.</note>
               <hi>me the main strength of my Defence lies in it.</hi>
Let what <hi>Strength</hi> you please lie in it, my
<hi>Defence</hi> was strong enough without it. For
to your bare Saying, <hi>my method of Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
might be of dangerous Consequence to any
Article of the Christian Faith,</hi> without proving
it, it was a defence strong enough barely to
deny, and put you upon shewing wherein
that danger lies, which therefore, this <hi>main
strength of my Defence,</hi> as you call it, apart, I
insist on.</p>
            <p>But as to your exception to what I said
on this occasion, it consists in this, that there
is a <hi>Certainty of Faith,</hi> and therefore you
set down my saying. <q>That to talk of
the Certainty of Faith, seems all one as
to talk of the Knowledge of believing.</q>As that which <hi>shews the inconsistency of my
Notion of Ideas, with the Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith.</hi> These are your Words here,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 23.</note>
and yet you tell me,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 74.</note> 
               <hi>That it is not my way
of Ideas, but my way of Certainty by Ideas,
that your Lordship is unsatisfied about.</hi> What
must I do now in the Case, when your
Words are expresly, that my <hi>Notion of <hi>Ideas</hi>
               </hi>
have an inconsistency with the Articles of
the Christian Faith: Must I presume that
your Lordship means my <hi>Notion of <hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi>
               </hi>
All that I can do, is to search out your
meaning the best I can, and then shew where
I apprehend it not conclusive. But this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65912:67"/>
in most places, what you mean,
makes me so much work, that a great deal
is omitted, and yet my Answer is too
long.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship asks in the next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 23.</note> 
               <hi>How comes the Certainty of Faith
so hard a Point with me? Answ.</hi> I suppose
you ask this Question more to give others
hard thoughts of my Opinion of Faith,
than to be informed your self. For you
cannot be ignorant that all along in my
<hi>Essay</hi> I use <hi>Certainty</hi> for <hi>Knowledge;</hi> so that
for you to ask me, <hi>How comes the Certainty
of Faith to become so hard a Point with me?</hi>
is the same thing, as for you to ask, How
comes the <hi>knowledge of Faith,</hi> or if you
please, <hi>the knowledge of Believing</hi> to be so
hard a Point with me? A Question which
I suppose you will think needs no Answer,
let your meaning in that doubtful Phrase
be what it will.</p>
            <p>I used in my Book the term <hi>Certainty</hi>
for Knowledge so generally, that no body
that has read my Book, though much less
attentively than your Lordship, can doubt
of it. That I used it in that sense there, I
shall refer my Reader but to two places<note n="*" place="margin">L<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. C. 1. § 1. &amp; C. 11. § 9.</note>
amongst many to convince him. This I
am sure, your Lordship could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that by <hi>Certainty</hi> I mean <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
since I have so used it in my Letters to
you, Instances whereof are not a few;
some of them may be found in the places
marked in the Margent<note n="†" place="margin">1 Let p. 81, 82, 107, 111, 115, 118, 131, 138, 158, 171, 185.</note>: And in my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Letter, what I say in the leaf imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65912:67"/>
preceding that which you quote
upon this occasion, would have put it past
a possibility for any one to make shew of
a doubt of it, had not that been amongst
those Pages of my Answer, which for
its being out of its <hi>proper place,</hi> it seems
you were resolved not to take notice of;
and therefore I hope it will not be besides
my purpose here to mind you of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>After having said something to shew why
I used <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> for the same
thing, I added,<note n="*" place="margin">2d Let. p. 93.</note> that <q>Your Lordship
could not but take notice of this in the
18th §. of Ch. 4. of my 4th Book, it
being a Passage you had quoted, and runs
thus; Where-ever we perceive the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or disagreement of any of our Ida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
there is certain Knowledge; And
where-ever we are sure those Ideas agree
with the reality of things, there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
real Knowledge; of which having
given the marks, I think I have shewn
wherein <hi>Certainty,</hi> real Certainty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</q>
And I farther add in the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
following Words,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 94.</note> 
               <q>That my
definition of Knowledge in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the 4th Book of my <hi>Essay</hi> stands
thus, Knowledge seems to be nothing
but the perception of the connection and
agreement, or disagreement and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
of any of our Ideas.</q> Which is
the very definition of <hi>Certainty,</hi> that your
Lordship is here contesting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:65912:68"/>
Since then you could not but know that
in this discourse, <hi>Certainty</hi> with me stood
for, or was the same thing with <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
may not one justly wonder how you
come to ask me such a Question as this,
<hi>How comes the Knowledge of Believing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so hard a Point with me?</hi> For that was
in effect the Question that you asked, when
you put in the term <hi>Certainty,</hi> since you
knew as undoubtedly, that I meant <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
by <hi>Certainty,</hi> as that I meant <hi>Believing</hi>
by <hi>Faith,</hi> i. e. you could doubt of neither.
And that you did not doubt of it, is plain
from what you say in the next Page, where
you endeavour to prove this an improper
way of speaking.</p>
            <p>Whether it be a proper way of speaking,
I allow to be a fair Question. But when
you knew what I meant, though I expressed
it improperly, to put Questions in a Word
of mine, used in a sense different from mine,
which could not but be apt to insinuate to
the Reader, that my Notion of Certainty
derogated from the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Faith,</hi> as the Scripture calls it, is
what I guess in another, would make your
Lordship ask again, <hi>Is this fair and ingenuous
dealing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, my Bible expresses<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 10. 22.</note> the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degree of Faith, which the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to Believers in his time by <hi>full
assurance.</hi> But <hi>assurance of Faith,</hi> though it
be <hi>what assurance soever,</hi> will by no means
down with your Lordship in my writing.
You say<note n="*" place="margin">p. 26.</note> I allow <hi>assurance of Faith,</hi> God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65912:68"/>
I should do otherwise; but then you ask,
<hi>Why not Certainty as well as Assurance?</hi> My
Lord, I think it may be a Reason not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
a poor Lay-man, and such as he
might presume would satisfie a Bishop of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> that he found his Bible
to speak so. I find my Bible speaks of the
<hi>Assurance of Faith,</hi> but no <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here, that I can
remember, of the <hi>Certainty of Faith,</hi> though
in many places it speaks of the <hi>Certainty of
Knowledge,</hi> and therefore I speak so too;
and shall not I think be condemned for
keeping close to the Expressions of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
though the Scripture Language, as
it is, does not so well serve your Lordship's
turn in the present Case. When I shall see
in an authentick Translation of our Bible,
the Phrase chang'd, it will then be time
enough for me to change it too, and call it
not the <hi>Assurance</hi> but <hi>Certainty of Faith:</hi> But
till then I shall not be ashamed of it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
you reproach me with it, by
terming it<note n="†" place="margin">p. 31.</note> The Assurance of Faith <hi>as I
call it;</hi> when you might as well have term'd
it The Assurance of Faith, <hi>as</hi> our Bibles
<hi>call it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It being plain, that by <hi>Certainty</hi> I meant
Knowledge, and by <hi>Faith</hi> the act of Believing,
that these Words<note n="*" place="margin">p. 23.</note> where you ask, <hi>How
comes the Certainty of Faith so hard a Point
with me?</hi> And where you tell me,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 26.</note> 
               <hi>I will
allow no Certainty of Faith,</hi> may make no
wrong impression in Mens Minds, who may
be apt to understand them of the Object,
and not meerly of the act of Believing. I
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65912:69"/>
crave leave to say with Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">C. 6 § 3.</note> 
               <q>That I do heartily acknowledge and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Articles of our Faith to be in
themselves Truths as <hi>certain</hi> and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as the very common Principles of
Geometry or Metaphysicks. But that
there is not required of us a Knowledge
of them and an adherence to them as <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
as that of Sense or Science;</q> and
that for this Reason, (amongst others given
both by Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hooker)
viz.</hi> 
               <q>That Faith is not Knowledge, no
more than three is four, but eminently
contained in it: So that he that knows,
believes and something more; but he that
believes many times does not; nay, if
he doth barely and meerly believe, he
doth never know.</q> These are Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi>'s
own Words.<note n="*" place="margin">C. 6. § 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That this Assurance of Faith may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
very near to Certainty, and not
come short of it in a sure and steady influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on the Mind, I have so plainly declar'd,
<note n="*" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 17. § 16.</note> that no body, I think, can question it.
In my Chapter of Reason, which has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the honour of your Lordship's Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions,
I say of some Propositions
wherein Knowledge [<hi>i. e.</hi> in my Sense] Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
fails us, <q>That their probability is
so clear and strong, that Assent as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
follows it, as Knowledge does De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</q>
Does your Lordship as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
any greater Certainty than this to an
Article of meer Faith? if you do not? we
are it seems agreed in the thing; and so
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65912:69"/>
all, that you have so emphatically said about
it, is but to correct a mistake of mine in
the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, if it prove to be one:
A weighty Point, and well worth your
Lordship's bestowing so many Pages upon.
I say <hi>meer Faith,</hi> because though a Man may
be a Christian, who meerly believes that
there is a God, yet that is not an Article of
meer Faith, because it may be demonstrated
that there is a God, and so may certainly be
known.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship goes on to ask,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Have
not all Mankind who have talked of Matters
of Faith, allowed a Certainty of Faith as well
as a Certainty of Knowledge?</hi> To answer a
question concerning what <hi>all Mankind who
have talked of Faith have done,</hi> may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the reach of your great Learning: As for
me, my reading reaches not so far. The
Apostles and the Evangelists, I can answer,
have <hi>talked of Matters of Faith,</hi> but I do not
find in my Bible, that they have any where
spoke (for 'tis of speaking here the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is) of the <hi>Certainty of Faith;</hi> and what
they <hi>allow,</hi> which they do not speak of, I
cannot tell. I say in my Bible, meaning
the <hi>English</hi> Translation used in our Church;
though what <hi>all Mankind,</hi> who speak not
of Faith in <hi>English,</hi> can do towards the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding
of this Question I do not see, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about the signification of an <hi>English</hi>
word. And whether in propriety of speech
it can be applied to <hi>Faith,</hi> can only be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
by those who understand <hi>English,</hi>
which <hi>all Mankind who have talked of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65912:70"/>
of Matters of Faith,</hi> I humbly conceive did
not.</p>
            <p>To prove that <hi>Certainty</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> may
be applied to Faith, you say,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 24.</note> 
               <hi>That among
the</hi> Romans <hi>it was opposed to doubting,</hi> and for
that you bring this Latin Sentence, <hi>Nil tam
certum est quam quod de dubio certum. Answ.
Certum, among the</hi> Romans, might be <hi>opposed
to doubting,</hi> and yet not be <hi>applied to Faith,</hi>
because <hi>Knowledge,</hi> as well as <hi>Believing,</hi> is
<hi>opposed to doubting;</hi> and therefore unless it
had pleased your Lordship to have quoted
the Author out of which this Latin Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is taken, one cannot tell whether <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
be not in it spoken of a thing known,
and not of a thing believed; though if it
were so, I humbly conceive it would not
prove what you say, <hi>viz.</hi> That it, <hi>i. e.</hi> the
word <hi>Certainty</hi> (for to that it must refer
here, or to nothing that I understand) was
<hi>among the</hi> Romans applied to Faith; for as
I take it, they never used the <hi>English</hi> word
<hi>Certainty;</hi> and though it be true, that the
<hi>English</hi> word <hi>Certainty</hi> be taken from the
<hi>Latin</hi> word <hi>Certus,</hi> yet that therefore <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
in <hi>English</hi> is used exactly in the same
sense, that <hi>Certus</hi> is in <hi>Latin,</hi> that I think
you will not say; for then Certainty in
<hi>English</hi> must signifie Purpose and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mind, for to that <hi>Certus</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are pleased here<note n="†" place="margin">p. 24.</note> to tell me, <hi>That
in my former Letter</hi> I said, <q>That if we
knew the Original of Words, we should
be much helped to the Ideas they were
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65912:70"/>
first applied to, and made to stand for.</q>
I grant it true, nor shall I unsay it here.
For I said not, that a Word, that had its
Original in one Language, kept always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
the same Signification in another Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
into which it was from thence tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splanted.
But if you will give me leave to
remind you of it, I remember that you,
my Lord, say<note n="*" place="margin">Vindic. p. 237.</note> in the same place, <hi>That lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
weight is to be laid upon a bare Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Etymology, when a Word is used in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sense by the best Authors.</hi> And I think
you could not have brought a more proper
instance to verifie that saying, than that
which you produce here.</p>
            <p>But pray, my Lord, why so far about?
Why are we sent to the antient <hi>Romans?</hi>
Why must we consult (which is no easie
task) <hi>all Mankind, who have talked of Faith,</hi>
to know whether <hi>Certainty</hi> be properly used
for <hi>Faith</hi> or no, when to determine it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
your Lordship and Me, there is so
sure a Remedy, and so near at hand? It is
but for you to say wherein Certainty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.
This, when I gently offer'd to your
Lordship in my first Letter, you interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it<note n="†" place="margin">1st Ans. p. 69.</note> to be a design to draw you out of
your way.</p>
            <p>I am sorry, my Lord, you should think
it out of your way to put an end, a short
end to a Controversie, which you think of
such moment: Methinks it should not be
<hi>out of your way,</hi> with one blow, finally to
overthrow an Assertion, which you think
to be <hi>of dangerous consequence to that Article of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65912:71"/>
Faith, which your Lordship has endeavoured to
defend.</hi> I proposed the same again<note n="*" place="margin">2d Let. p. 94.</note> where
I say, <q>For this there is a very easie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy:
It is but for your Lordship to
set aside this Definition of Knowledge,
by giving us a better, and this danger is
over. But you choose rather to have a
Controversie with my Book, for having
it in it, and to put me upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of it.</q> This is so express, that
your taking no notice of it, puts me at a
loss what to think. To say that a Man so
great in Letters, does not know wherein
<hi>Certainty</hi> consists, is a greater presumption
than I will be guilty of; and yet to think
that you do know and will not tell, is yet
harder. Who can think, or will dare to say,
That your Lordship so much concerned for
the Articles of Faith, and engaged in this
dispute with me, by your <hi>duty,</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of them, should choose to keep up
a Controversie with me rather than remove
that danger, which my wrong Notion of
<hi>Certainty</hi> threatens to the Articles of Faith?
For, my Lord, since the Question is moved,
and it is brought by your Lordship to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Dispute, wherein <hi>Certainty</hi> consists, a
great many knowing no better, may take up
with what I have said; and rather than have
no Notion of <hi>Certainty</hi> at all, will stick by
mine, till a better be shew'd them. And
if mine tends to <hi>Scepticism,</hi> as you say, and
you will not furnish them with one that
does not, what is it but to give way to <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism,</hi>
and let it quietly prevail on Men
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65912:71"/>
as either having my Notion of <hi>Certainty,</hi>
or none at all? Your Lordship indeed says
something in excuse in your 75th Page,
which that my <hi>Answer</hi> may be in the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place,</hi> shall be consider'd when we come
there.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship declares,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 25.</note> 
               <hi>That you are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
against any private Mints of Words.</hi> I
know not what the Publick may do for
your particular Satisfaction in the Case;
but till publick Mints of Words are erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I know no Remedy for it, but that you
must patiently suffer this matter to go on
in the same course, that I think it has gone
in ever since Language has been in use.
Here in this Island, as far as my knowledge
reaches, I do not find, that ever since the
<hi>Saxons</hi> time, in all the alterations that
have been made in our Language, that any
one Word or Phrase has had its Authority
from the Great Seal, or passed by Act of
Parliament.</p>
            <p>When the dazling Metaphor of the <hi>Mint</hi>
and <hi>new mill'd Words,</hi> &amp;c. (which mightily,
as it seems, delighted your Lordship when
you were writing that Paragraph) will give
you leave to consider this matter plainly
as it is, you will find, that the Coining of
Mony in publickly authoriz'd <hi>Mints,</hi> affords
no manner of Argument against private
Mens medling in the introducing new, or
changing the signification of old <hi>Words;</hi>
every one of which alterations always has
its rise from some <hi>private Mint.</hi> The Case
in short is this, Mony by vertue of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65912:72"/>
Stamp, received in the publick <hi>Mint,</hi> which
vouches its intrinsick Worth, has authority
to pass. This use of the publick Stamp
would be lost, if private Men were suffer'd
to offer Mony stamp'd by themselves: On
the contrary, Words are offer'd to the
Publick by every <hi>private</hi> Man, Coined in his
<hi>private Mint,</hi> as he pleases; but 'tis the
receiving of them by others, their very
passing, that gives them their Authority
and Currancy, and not the Mint they come
out of. <hi>Horace,</hi> I think, has given a true
account of this matter,<note n="†" place="margin">de Arte Poet.</note> in a Country very
jealous of any Usurpation upon the publick
Authority.

            <p>Here we see <hi>Horace</hi> expresly says, That
<hi>private Mints of Words</hi> were always Licensed,
and, with <hi>Horace</hi> I humbly conceive so they

<hi>your Lordship may be against them.</hi> And
therefore he that offers to the Publick <hi>new
mill'd Words</hi> from his own <hi>private Mint,</hi> is
not always in that so bold an Invader of
the publick Authority, as you would make
him.</p>
            <p>This I say not to excuse my self in the
present Case, for I deny, that I have at
all changed the signification of the word
<hi>Certainty.</hi> And therefore if you had pleased
you might, my Lord, have spared your say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on this Occasion,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 24, &amp; 25.</note> 
               <hi>That it seems our
old Words must not now pass in the current
Sense.</hi> And <hi>those Persons assume too much Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to themselves, who will not suffer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Words to pass in their general accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and other things to the same purpose
in this Paragraph, till you had proved,
that in strict propriety of speech it could
be said, That a Man was <hi>certain</hi> of that
which he did not know but only believed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:65912:73"/>
If you had had time in the heat of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to have made a little Reflection on the
use of the English word <hi>Certainty</hi> in strict
Speaking, perhaps your Lordship would not
have been so forward to have made my
using it, only for precise <hi>Knowledge,</hi> so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous
an impropriety; at least you would
not have accused it of weakening the <hi>Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of any Article of Faith.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, People commonly say,
they are <hi>certain</hi> of what they barely Believe,
without doubting. But 'tis as true, that
they as commonly say, that they <hi>Know</hi> it
too. But no Body from thence concludes,
that <hi>Believing</hi> is <hi>Knowing.</hi> As little can
they conclude from the like vulgar way of
Speaking, that <hi>Believing</hi> is <hi>Certainty.</hi> All
that is meant thereby is no more but this,
that the full assurance of their Faith, as stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
determins their assent to the imbracing
of that Truth, as if they actually knew
it.</p>
            <p>But however, such Phrases as these are
used to shew the steadiness and assurance
of their Faith, who thus Speak; yet they
alter not the propriety of our Language,
which I think appropriates <hi>Certainty</hi> only to
<hi>Knowledge,</hi> when in strict and philosophical
Discourse it is, upon that account, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguished
to <hi>Faith,</hi> as in this case here
your Lordship knows it is, whereof there
is an express Evidence in my first Letter,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 115.</note>
where I say, <q>That I speak of <hi>Belief,</hi> and
your Lordship of <hi>Certainty,</hi> and that I meant
<hi>Belief</hi> and not <hi>Certainty.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:65912:73"/>
Your Lordship says,<note place="margin">p. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Certainty is common
to both Knowledge and Faith, unless I think
it impossible to be certain upon any Testimony
whatsoever.</hi> I think it is possible to be <hi>certain</hi>
upon the <hi>Testimony</hi> of God (for that I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you mean) where I know that it is the
<hi>Testimony</hi> of God, because in such a Case,
that Testimony is capable not only to make
me believe, but if I consider it right, to
make me know the thing to be so; and so
I may be <hi>certain.</hi> For the veracity of God
is as capable of making me know a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to be true, as any other way of Proof
can be, and therefore I do not in such a
case, barely <hi>Believe,</hi> but know such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to be true, and attain <hi>Certainty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sum of your Accusation is drawn
up<note n="*" place="margin">p. 26.</note> thus, <hi>That I have appropriated Certainty</hi>
to the perception of the agreement of disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Ideas in any Proposition; <hi>and
now I find this will not hold as to Articles of
Faith; and therefore I will allow no Certainty
of Faith; which you think is not for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of my Cause.</hi> The truth of matter of
Fact is in short this. That I have placed
Knowledge in the perception of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or disagreement of Ideas. This defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Knowledge your Lordship said might
<hi>be of dangerous Consequence to that Article of
Faith, which you have endeavoured to defend.</hi>
This I denied, and gave this Reason for it,
<note n="†" place="margin">2 Let. p. 94-98.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That a Definition of Knowledge,
whether a good or bad, true or false De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition,
could not be of ill or any Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to an Article of Faith. Because a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65912:74"/>
definition of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which was one
Act of the Mind, did not at all concern
<hi>Faith,</hi> which was another Act of the Mind
quite distinct from it. To this then, which
was the Proposition in Question between us,
your Lordship, I humbly conceive should
have answered. But instead of that, your
Lordship by the use of the word <hi>Certainty</hi>
in a Sense, that I used it not (for you knew
I used it only for Knowledge) would repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
me as having strange Notions of Faith.
Whether this be <hi>for the Advantage of your
Cause,</hi> your Lordship will do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.</p>
            <p>Upon such a use of the word <hi>Certainty</hi>
in a different Sense from what I use it in,
the force of all your Lordship says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 27.—31.</note> under
your first Head contained in the two or
three next Paragraphs, depends, as I think,
for I must own (Pardon my Dulness) that
I do not clearly comprehend the force of
what your Lordship there says: And it
will take up too many Pages, to examin it
Period by Period. In short therefore, I
take your Lordship's meaning<note n="*" place="margin">p. 27, 28.</note> to be this,</p>
            <p>That there are <hi>some Articles of Faith,</hi> viz.
<hi>the fundamental Principles of natural Religion,
which Mankind may attain to a Certainty in
by Reason without Revelation; which because
a Man that proceeds upon my Grounds, cannot
attain to Certainty in by Reason, their credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
to him, when they are considered as
purely <hi>matters of Faith will be weakened.</hi> Those
which your Lordship instances in are the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65912:74"/>
               <hi>Being of a God, Providence,</hi> and <hi>the Rewards
and Punishments of a future State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the way, as I humbly conceive,
your Lordship takes here to prove <hi>my Grounds
of Certainty</hi> (for so you call my definition
of Knowledge) to be of dangerous Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to the Articles of Faith.</p>
            <p>To avoid Ambiguity and Confusion in
the examining this Argument of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's,
the best way, I humbly conceive will
be, to lay by the term <hi>Certainty,</hi> which
your Lordship and I using in different Senses,
is the less fit to make what we say to one
another clearly understood; and instead
thereof, to use the term <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which
with me, your Lordship knows, is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's Proposition then as far
as it has any opposition to me, is this, That
if Knowledge be supposed to consist in the
perception of the agreement or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ideas, a Man cannot attain to the
Knowledge, that these Propositions, <hi>viz.
That there is a God, a Providence, and Rewards
and Punishments in a future State,</hi> are true;
and therefore the <hi>credibility</hi> of these Articles,
consider'd <hi>purely as matters of Faith,</hi> will be
<hi>weakened</hi> to him. Wherein there are these
Things to be proved by your Lordship.</p>
            <p>1. That upon my grounds of Knowledge
<hi>i. e.</hi> upon a supposition, that Knowledge
consists in the perception of the agreement
or disagreement of Ideas, we cannot attain
to the Knowledge of the Truth of either of
those Propositions, <hi>viz. That there is a God,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65912:75"/>
Providence, and Rewards and Punishments in
a future State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Your Lordship is to prove, That the
not knowing the Truth of any Proposition,
lessens the credibility of it; which in short,
amounts to this, that want of Knowledge
lessens Faith in any Proposition proposed.
This is the Proposition to be proved, if
your Lordship uses <hi>Certainty</hi> in the Sense
I use it, <hi>i. e.</hi> for Knowledge, in which
only use of it will it here bear upon me.</p>
            <p>But since I find your Lordship in these
two or three Paragraphs, to use the word
<hi>Certainty</hi> in so uncertain a Sense, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to signifie <hi>Knowledge</hi> by it, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Believing</hi> in general, <hi>i. e.</hi> any degree
of believing, give me leave to add that if
your Lordship means by these Words,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 27.</note>
               <hi>Let us suppose a Person by natural Reason to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to a Certainty as to the being of a God,</hi> &amp;c.
i. e. <hi>attain to a belief that there is a God,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>or the Souls Immortality.</hi> I say if you take Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
in such a Sense, then it will be incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
upon your Lordship to prove, That
if a Man finds the natural Reason whereupon
he entertained the belief of a God or of the
immortality of the Soul <hi>uncertain,</hi> that will
<hi>weaken the credibility of those fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
as matters of Faith,</hi> or which is in effect
the same. That the weakness of the <hi>credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of any article of Faith from Reason,
weakens the <hi>credibility</hi> of it from Revelation.
For 'tis this which these following Words
of yours<note n="†" place="margin">p. 28.</note> import. <hi>For before there was a
natural credibility in them on the account of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65912:75"/>
but by going on wrong grounds of Certainty
all that is lost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove the first of these Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>viz.</hi> That upon the supposition that
Knowledge consists in the perception of the
agreement of Ideas, we cannot attain to the
knowledge of the truth of this Proposition,
that there is a God. Your Lordship urges,
that I have said, <hi>That no Idea proves the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of the Thing without it self,</hi> which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
reduced to form, will stand thus.
If it be true, as I say, that no Idea proves
the existence of the thing without it self,
then upon the supposition that Knowledge
consists in the perception of the agreement or
disagreement of Ideas, we cannot attain to the
knowledge of the truth of this Proposition,
that there is a God: Which Argument so
manifestly proves not, that there needs no
more to be said to it, than to desire, that
consequence to be proved.</p>
            <p>Again, as to the immortality of the Soul
your Lordship urges<note n="*" place="margin">p. 28.</note>, that I have said, that
I cannot know but that <hi>matter may think;</hi>
therefore upon my ground of Knowledge, <hi>i. e.</hi>
upon a supposition that Knowledge consists
in the perception of the agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Ideas, there is an end of the
Souls Immortality. This consequence I
must also desire your Lordship to prove.
Only I crave leave by the by to point out
some things in these Paragraphs too remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be passed over without any Notice.</p>
            <p>One is, That you <hi>suppose</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 28.</note> 
               <hi>a Man is made
certain upon my general grounds of Certainty,</hi> i. e.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65912:76"/>
knows by the perception of the agreement
or disagreement of Ideas, that there is a
God, and yet upon <hi>a farther examination of
my method he finds that the way of Ideas will
not do.</hi> Here my Lord, if by <hi>my grounds of
Certainty, my Method,</hi> and <hi>my way of Ideas,</hi>
you mean one and the same thing, then your
Words will have a consistency and tend to
the same point. But then I must beg your
Lordship to consider, that your Supposition
carries a Contradiction in it, <hi>viz.</hi> That your
Lordship supposes, that by my <hi>Grounds,</hi> my
<hi>Method,</hi> and my <hi>way</hi> of Certainty, a Man
is made <hi>Certain</hi> and not <hi>made Certain,</hi> that
there is a God. If your Lordship means
here by my <hi>grounds of Certainty,</hi> my <hi>Method,</hi>
and <hi>my way of Ideas</hi> different things (as it
seems to me you do) then, whatever your
Lordship may suppose here, it makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the Point in Hand, which is to
shew, that by this my ground of Certainty,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Knowledge consists in the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the agreement or disagreement of
Ideas, a Man first attains to a Knowledge,
that there is a God, and afterwards by the
same grounds of Certainty he comes to lose
the Knowledge, that there is a God; which
to me seems little less than a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>'Tis likely your Lordship will say you
mean no such thing, for you alledge this
Proposition, <hi>that no Idea proves the existence
of any thing without it self,</hi> and give that as
an Instance, that my <hi>way of Ideas will not do,</hi>
i. e. will not prove the being of a God. 'Tis
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65912:76"/>
true your Lordship does so. But withal
my Lord, 'tis as true, that this Proposition,
supposing it to be mine (for it is not here
set down in my Words) contains not my
<hi>method,</hi> or <hi>way,</hi> or <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Certainty;</hi> though
'tis in that Sense alone, that it can here be
useful to your Lordship to call it my <hi>method,</hi>
or the <hi>way by Ideas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship undertakes to shew, That
my defining Knowledge to consist in the
perception of the agreement or disagreement
of Ideas, <hi>weakens the credibility of this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Article of Faith,</hi> that there is a God,
what is your Lordship's Proof of it? Just
this. The saying that <hi>no Idea proves the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of the thing without it self, will not do:</hi>
Ergo, the saying, that Knowledge consists
in the perception of the agreement or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
of Ideas, <hi>weakens the credibility</hi>
of this fundamental Article. This my Lord,
seems to me no Proof, and all that I can
find, that is offered to make it a Proof,
is only your calling these Propositions my
<hi>general grounds of Certainty, my method of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
the way of Ideas, and my own Principles
in point of Reason,</hi> as if that made these
two Propositions the same thing, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
were a consequence of one, may be
charged as a consequence of the other;
though it be visible, that though the latter
of these be never so false, or never so far
from being a Proof of a God, yet it will
by no means thence follow, that the former
of them, <hi>viz.</hi> That Knowledge consists in
the perception of the agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65912:77"/>
of Ideas, weakens the <hi>credibility
of that fundamental Article.</hi> But 'tis but
for your Lordship to call them both <hi>the way
of Ideas,</hi> and that is enough.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I may not be accused by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for</hi> unfair or disingenuous dealing for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
this Matter so, <hi>I shall here set down
your Lordship's Words at large.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 27.</note> Let us now
suppose a Person by natural Reason to attain to
a Certainty, as to the Being of God, and
Immortality of the Soul; and he proceeds upon
<hi>J. L's</hi> general grounds of Certainty, from the
agreement or disagreement of Ideas; and so
from the Ideas of God and the Soul, he is made
certain of these two Points before mention'd.
But let us again suppose that such a Person upon
a farther Examination of <hi>J. L's</hi> method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
finds, that the way of Ideas in these
Cases will not do; for <hi>no Idea proves the
existence of the thing without it self, no
more than the Picture of a Man proves his
Being, or the Visions of a Dream make a
true History,</hi> (which are <hi>J. L's.</hi> own Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
And for the <hi>Soul</hi> he cannot be <hi>certain,
but that Matter may think,</hi> (as <hi>J. L.</hi> affirms)
and then what becomes of the Soul's Immateriali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
(and consequently Immortality) from its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations?
But for all this, says <hi>J. L. his assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Faith remains firm on its own
Basis.</hi> Now you appeal to any Man of Sense,
whether the finding of Vncertainty of his own
Principles, which he went upon in point of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
doth not weaken the Credibility of these
fundamental Articles when they are consider'd
purely as matters of Faith? For before there
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65912:77"/>
was a natural Credibility in them on the account
of Reason; but by going on wrong grounds of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
all that is lost; and instead of being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
he is more doubtful than ever. <hi>These
are your Lordship's own Words; and now</hi>
I appeal to any Man of Sense, <hi>whether they
contain any other Argument against my
placing of Certainty as I do, but this,</hi> viz.
<hi>A Man mistakes and thinks that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi>
no Idea, proves the existence of the
thing without it self, <hi>shews, That in</hi> the way
of Ideas <hi>one cannot prove a God,</hi> Ergo, <hi>this
Proposition, Certainty consists in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the agreement or disagreement
of Ideas, weakens the credibility of this
fundament Article, that there is a God. And
so of the immortality of the Soul, because
I say, I know not but Matter may think:
Your Lordship would infer,</hi> Ergo, <hi>my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of Certainty</hi> weakens <hi>the</hi> credibility
<hi>of the Revelation of the Souls immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship is pleased here, to call
this Proposition, <q>That Knowledge or
Certainty consists in the perception of the
agreement or disagreement of Ideas,</q> 
               <hi>My
general grounds of Certainty,</hi> as if I had some
more particular grounds of Certainty.
Whereas I have no other <hi>Ground</hi> or <hi>Notion</hi>
of Certainty, but this one alone; all my
Notion of Certainty is contained in that
one particular Proposition; but perhaps
your Lordship did it, that you might make
the Proposition, above quoted, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>No
Idea proves the existence of the thing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65912:78"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:65912:78"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:65912:79"/>
without it self under the Title you give
it of <hi>the way of Ideas,</hi> pass for one of
my particular Grounds of Certainty; whereas it is no more any Ground of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of mine, or definition of Knowledge,
than any other Proposition in my Book.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing very remarkable in what
your Lordship here says, is, That you make
the failing to attain Knowledge by any
way of <hi>Certainty</hi> in some particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
to be the <hi>finding the uncertainty</hi> of
the way it self, which is all one as to say,
That if a Man misses by <hi>Algebra,</hi> the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Knowledge of some Propositions in
Mathematicks, therefore he finds the way
or principles of <hi>Algebra</hi> to be uncertain
or false. This is your Lordship's way of
reasoning here: Your Lordship quotes out
of me, <q>That I say no Idea proves the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of the thing without it self.</q> And
that I say, <q>That one cannot be certain
that Matter cannot think;</q> from
whence your Lordship argues, That he who
says so, cannot attain to Certainty that
there is a God, or that the Soul is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
and thereupon your Lordship con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 28.</note> 
               <hi>he finds the uncertainty of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
he went upon, in Point of Reason,</hi> i. e.
that he finds this <hi>Principle</hi> or <hi>Ground</hi> of
<hi>Certainty</hi> he went upon in reasoning, <hi>viz.</hi>
That Certainty or Knowledge consists in
the perception of the agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Ideas, to be <hi>uncertain.</hi> For if
your Lordship means here <hi>by Principles he
went upon in Point of Reason</hi> any thing else,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65912:79"/>
but that definition of Knowledge, which
your Lordship calls my <hi>Way, Method,
Grounds,</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>Certainty,</hi> which I and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to the endangering some Articles of
Faith, <hi>go upon;</hi> I crave leave to say, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
nothing at all the Argument your
Lordship is upon, which is to prove, That
the placing of Certainty in the perception
of the agreement or disagreement of Ideas
may be of dangerous consequence to any
Article of Faith.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship in the next place<note n="†" place="margin">p: 29, 30.</note> says,
<hi>Before we can believe any thing upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Revelation, we must suppose there is
a God.</hi> What use does your Lordship make
of this? Your Lordship thus argues; But
by my way of Certainty, a Man is made
uncertain whether there be a God or no.
For that to me is the meaning of those
Words,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 29.</note> 
               <hi>How can his Faith stand firm as
to Divine Revelation, when he is made uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
by his own way, whether there be a God
or no?</hi> Or they can to me mean nothing
to the Question in hand. What is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
from hence? This it must be, or
nothing to the purpose, <hi>Ergo,</hi> my defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of Knowledge, or which is the same
thing, my placing of Certainty in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the agreement or disagreement
of Ideas, leaves not the Articles of Faith
the same credibility they had before.</p>
            <p>To excuse my dulness in not being able
to comprehend this consequence, pray, my
Lord, consider, that your Lordship says,
<note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Before we can believe any thing upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65912:80"/>
of Revelation, it must be supposed that there
is a God.</hi> But cannot he who places Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the perception of the agreement and
disagreement of Ideas, <hi>supposes there is a
God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But your Lordship means by <hi>suppose,</hi> that
one must be <hi>certain</hi> that there is a God.
Let it be so, and let it be your Lordship's
priviledge in Controversie to use one word
for another, though of a different signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as I think to <hi>suppose</hi> and be <hi>certain</hi>
are. Cannot one that places <hi>Certainty</hi> in
the perception of the agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Ideas, be certain there is a
God? I can assure you, my Lord, I am <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
there is a God; and yet I own, That
I place Certainty in the perception of the
agreement or disagreement of Ideas: Nay,
I dare venture to say to your Lordship,
That I have proved there is a God, and
see no inconsistency at all between these
two Propositions, That Certainty consists
in the perception of the agreement of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
of Ideas; and that it is certain
there is a God. So that this my Notion
of <hi>Certainty,</hi> this definition of Knowledge,
for any thing your Lordship has said to the
contrary, leaves to this Fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
the same <hi>Credibility,</hi> and the same <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
it had before.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship says farther,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 29.</note> 
               <hi>To suppose
Divine Revelation, we must be certain that there
is a principle above Matter and Motion in the
World.</hi> Here again, my Lord, your way
of writing makes work for my Ignorance,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65912:80"/>
and before I can either admit or deny this
Proposition, or judge what force it has to
prove the Proposition in question, I must
distinguish it into these different Senses,
which I think your Lordship's way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may comprehend. For your Lordship
may mean it thus; <hi>To suppose Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
we must be certain,</hi> i. e. we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>that there is a principle above Matter
and Motion in the World.</hi> Or your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
may mean thus; <hi>We must be certain,</hi>
i. e. we must know <hi>that there is something
above Matter or Motion in the World.</hi> In
the next place your Lordship may mean by
something <hi>above Matter and Motion,</hi> either
simply an intelligent Being; for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
without determining what Being it
is in, is a <hi>principle above Matter and Motion.</hi>
Or your Lordship may mean an immaterial
intelligent Being; so that this undetermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
way of expressing, includes at least four
distinct Propositions, whereof some are
true, and others not so. For</p>
            <p>1. My Lord, if your Lordship means,
<hi>That to suppose a Divine Revelation,</hi> a Man
must be <hi>certain,</hi> i. e. must certainly know
that there is an intelligent Being in the
World, and that that intelligent Being is
immaterial from whence that Revelation
comes; I deny it. For a Man may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Revelation upon the <hi>belief</hi> of an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Being, from whence it comes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being able to make out to himself, by
a Scientifical Reasoning, that there is such
a Being. A proof whereof I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65912:81"/>
are the <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> among the
Christians heretofore, who nevertheless re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
not the Revelation of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament;
and he that will talk with illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
People in this Age, will, I doubt not,
find many who believe the Bible to be the
Word of God, though they imagine God
himself in the shape of an Old Man sitting
in Heaven, which they could not do, if
they knew, <hi>i. e.</hi> had examined and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
any demonstration whereby he is
proved to be immaterial, without which
they cannot know it.</p>
            <p>2. If your Lordship means, That to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Divine Revelation, it is necessary
to know, that there is simply an intelligent
Being; this also I deny. For <hi>to suppose a
Divine Revelation,</hi> is not necessary that a
Man should know that there is such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
Being in the World: I say, know,
<hi>i. e.</hi> from things, that he does know, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratively
deduce the proof of such a
Being; it is enough for the receiving Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation <hi>to believe,</hi> that there is such
a Being, without having by demonstration
attained to the Knowledge, that there is a
God. Every one that believes right, does
not always reason exactly, especially in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
Metaphysical Speculations; and if no
body can believe the Bible to be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation, but he that clearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
the whole deduction, and sees
the evidence of the demonstration wherein
the existence of an intelligent Being, on
whose Will all other Beings depend, is Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entifically
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65912:81"/>
proved, there are I fear but few
Christians among illiterate People, to look
no farther. He that believes there is a
God, though he does no more than believe
it, and has not attained to the Certainty
of Knowledge, <hi>i. e.</hi> does not see the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
demonstration of it, has Ground e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to admit of Divine Revelation. The
Apostle tells us, <hi>That he that will come to
God, must believe that he is;</hi> But I do not
remember the Scripture any where says,
That he must know that he is.</p>
            <p>3. In the next place, if your Lordship
means, That <hi>to suppose Divine Revelation, a
Man must be certain,</hi> i. e. explicitly believe,
that there is a perfectly immaterial Being, I
shall leave it to your Lordship's conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
whether it may not be Ground
enough for the <hi>Supposition of a Revelation</hi> to
believe, that there is an all-knowing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
Being, who can neither deceive nor
be deceived, without a Man's precisely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
in his Thoughts, whether that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring,
omniscient Being be immaterial or
no. 'Tis past all doubt, that every one
that examins and reasons right, may come
to a Certainty, that God is perfectly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material.
But it may be a question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
every one who believes a Revelation
to be from God, may have enter'd into
the disquisition of the immateriality of his
Being? Whether, I say, every ignorant
day Labourer, who believes the Bible to
be the Word of God, has in his mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
materiality and immateriality, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65912:82"/>
does explicitly believe God to be imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,
I shall leave to your Lordship to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
if you think fit more expresly than
your Words do here.</p>
            <p>4. If your Lordship means, <hi>That to suppose
a Divine Revelation, a Man must becertain,</hi> i. e.
believe <hi>that there is a supreme intelligent Being,</hi>
from whom it comes, who can neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
nor be deceived. I grant it to be true.</p>
            <p>These being the several Propositions,
either of which may be meant in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
so general, and to me doubtful, way
of expressing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your self to avoid the length,
which a particular Answer to each of them
would run me into, I will venture (and it
is a venture to answer to an ambiguous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in one Sense, when the Author has
the liberty of saying he meant it in another,
a great convenience of general loose and
doubtful Expressions) I will, I say, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to answer to it in the Sense I guess
most suited to your Lordship's purpose;
and see what your Lordship proves by it.
I will therefore suppose your Lordship's
Reasoning to be this; That</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To suppose Divine Revelation, a Man must
be certain,</hi> i. e. believe <hi>that there is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
above Matter and Motion,</hi> i. e. an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
intelligent Being <hi>in the World.</hi> Let
it be so; what does your Lordship infer?
<hi>Therefore upon the Principles of Certainty</hi> by
Ideas, he [<hi>i. e.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 29.</note> he that places Certainty in
the perception of the agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Ideas,] <hi>cannot be certain of [i. e.</hi>
believe] <hi>this</hi>]. This consequence seems a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65912:82"/>
little strange, but your Lordship proves it
thus; <hi>Because he <hi>does</hi> not know but Matter
may think:</hi> Which Argument put into form,
will stand thus;</p>
            <p>If one who places Certainty in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the agreement or disagreement
of Idea, does <hi>not know but Matter may think;</hi>
then whoever places Certainty so, <hi>cannot</hi>
believe there is an immaterial intelligent
Being in the World.</p>
            <p>But there is one who placing Certainty in
the perception of the agreement or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ideas, <hi>does</hi> not know but Matter
may think:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> whoever places Certainty in the
perception of the agreement or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ideas, <hi>cannot</hi> believe that there is
an intelligent immaterial Being.</p>
            <p>This Argumentation is so defective in
every part of it, that for fear I should be
thought to make an Argument for your
Lordship in requital for the Answer your
Lordship made for me, I must desire the
Reader to consider; your Lordship says,
<hi>We <hi>must be certain:</hi> He <hi>cannot be certain,
because he</hi> doth <hi>not know,</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 29.</note> which in short, is
<hi>We</hi> cannot because he <hi>cannot,</hi> and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
because he <hi>doth not.</hi> This consider'd, will
justifie the Syllogism I have made to contain
your Lordship's Argument in its full force.</p>
            <p>I come therefore to the Syllogism it self,
and there first I deny the Minor which is this:</p>
            <p>There is one who placing Certainty in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the agreement or disagreement of Ideas,
<hi>doth</hi> not know but Matter may think.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:65912:83"/>
I begin with this, because this is the
Foundation of all your Lordship's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and therefore I desire your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
would produce any one who placing
Certainty in the perception of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or disagreement of Ideas, <hi>does not
know but Matter may think.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reason why I press this, is because
I suppose your Lordship means me here,
and would have it thought that I say, I
do not know <hi>but that Matter may think:</hi> But
that I do not say so; nor any thing else
from whence may be infer'd what your
Lordship adds in the annexed Words,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 29.</note> if
they can be infer'd from it, <hi>And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
all Revelation may be nothing but the
effects of an exalted Fancy, or the heats of a
disorder'd Imagination, as</hi> Spinosa <hi>affirm'd.</hi>
On the contrary, I do say,<note n="*" place="margin">B. 4. C. 10. § 10.</note> 
               <q>It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to conceive that matter, either
with or without motion, could have
originally in and from it self Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and knowledge.</q> And having in
that Chapter establish'd this Truth, That
there is an eternal immaterial knowing
Being, I think no body but your Lordship
could have imputed to me the doubting,
that there was such a Being, because I say
in another place,<note n="†" place="margin">B. 4. C. 3. § 6.</note> and to another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<q>It is impossible for us by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of our own Ideas, without
<hi>Revelation,</hi> to discover, whether Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
has not given to some Systems
of Matter fitly disposed, a power to
perceive and think, or else joined and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65912:83"/>
fixed to Matter so disposed, a thinking
immaterial Substance: It being in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of our Notions, not much more
remote from our Comprehensions to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that God can, if he pleases, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradd
to our Idea of Matter a Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Thinking, than that he should
superadd to it another Substance, with
a faculty of Thinking.</q> From my say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus, That God (whom I have proved
to be an immaterial Being) by his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency,
may, for ought we know, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>add
to some parts of Matter a faculty of
Thinking, it requires some skill for any
one to represent me as your Lordship does
here, as one ignorant or doubtful whether
<hi>Matter may not think;</hi> to that degree, that
I am not <hi>certain,</hi> or I do not believe <hi>that
there is a Principle above Matter and Motion
in the World</hi> and <hi>consequently all Revelation
may be nothing but the effects of an exalted
Fancy or the heats of a disordered Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as</hi> Spinosa <hi>affirm'd.</hi> For thus I, or
some Body else (whom I desire your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to produce) stands painted in this your
Lordship's Argument from the <hi>supposition
of a Divine Revelation,</hi> which your Lordship
brings here to prove, That the defining of
Knowledge, as I do, to consist in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the Agreement or Disagreement
of Ideas, <hi>weakens the Credibility of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Christian Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if your Lordship thinks it so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a Position to say, <q>It is not much
harder for us to conceive, that God
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65912:84"/>
can, if he pleases, superadd to Matter
a faculty of Thinking, than that he
should superadd to it another Substance
with a faculty of Thinking.</q> (which
is the utmost I have said concerning the
faculty of Thinking in Matter.) I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceive it would be more to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to prove, That the infinite, omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Creator of all Things, out of nothing,
cannot, if he pleases, superadd to some
parcels of Matter, disposed as he sees fit,
a faculty of Thinking, which the rest of
Matter has not; rather than to represent
me, with that Candour your Lordship does,
as one, who so far makes Matter a Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thing, as thereby to question the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>a Principle above Matter and Motion in
the World,</hi> and consequently to take away
all <hi>Revelation,</hi> which how natural and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
a Representation it is of my Sense,
expressed in the Passages of my <hi>Essay,</hi>
which I have above set down, I humbly
submit to the Reader's Judgment and
your Lordship's Zeal for Truth to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;
and shall not stay to examin whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Man may not have <hi>an exalted Phancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the heats of a disorder'd Imagination,</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overthrowing Divine Revelation, tho'
the power of Thinking be placed only in
an immaterial Substance:</p>
            <p>I come now to the sequel of your Major,
which is this:</p>
            <p>If one who places Certainty in the perception
of the agreement or disagreement of Ideas, <hi>does
not</hi> know but Matter may Think; then whoever
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65912:84"/>
places Certainty so, <hi>cannot</hi> believe there is an
immaterial intelligent Being in the World.</p>
            <p>The consequence here, is from <hi>does not</hi>
to <hi>cannot,</hi> which I cannot but wonder to
find in an Argument of your Lordships.
For he that <hi>does</hi> not to Day believe or know,
that Matter cannot be so ordered by God's
Omnipotency as to think (if that subverts
the belief of an immaterial intelligent Being
in the World) may know or believe it to
Morrow, or if he should never know or
believe it, yet others who define Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
as he does, may know or believe it.
Unless your Lordship can prove, that it
is impossible for any one, who defines
Knowledge, to consist in the perception of
the agreement or disagreement of Ideas, to
know or believe, that Matter cannot Think.
But this, as I remember, your Lordship has
not any where attempted to prove. And
yet without this, your Lordship's way of
Reasoning is no more, than to argue, that
one <hi>cannot</hi> do a thing because another <hi>does
not</hi> do it. And yet upon this strange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
is built all that your Lordship
brings here to prove, that my definition of
Knowledge, <hi>weakens the credibility of Articles
of Faith,</hi> v. g.</p>
            <p>It weakens the credibility of this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Article of Faith, that there is a God!
How so? Because I who have so defined
Knowledge, say in my <hi>Essay,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">B. 4. C. 11. § 1.</note> 
               <q>That
the Knowledge of the Existence of any
other thing [but of God] we can have
only by <hi>Sensation.</hi> For there being no
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65912:85"/>
necessary connexion of <hi>real Existence</hi> with
any <hi>Idea</hi> a Man hath in his Memory, nor
of any other Existence but that of <hi>God,</hi>
with the Existence of any particular Man;
no particular Man can know the <hi>Existence</hi>
of any other Being, but only when by
actual operating upon him, it makes it
self perceived by him. For the having
the <hi>Idea</hi> of any thing in our Mind, no
more proves the Existence of that thing,
than the Picture of a Man evidences his
Being in the World, or the Visions of
a Dream, make thereby a true History.</q>
For so are the Words of my Book, and not
as your Lordship has been pleased to set
them down here;<note n="†" place="margin">p. 28.</note> and they were well
chosen by your Lordship, to shew, that
the <hi>way of Ideas would not do.</hi> i. e. In my
way by Ideas, I cannot prove there is a
God.</p>
            <p>But supposing I had said in that place,
or any other, that which would hinder
the proof of a God, as I have not, might
I not see my Error, and alter or renounce
that Opinion without changing my defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Knowledge? Or could not another
Man who defined Knowledge, as I do, avoid
Thinking as your Lordship says, I say, <hi>That
no Idea proves the Existence of the thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it self,</hi> and so able, notwithstanding
my saying so, to prove that there is a
God?</p>
            <p>Again, your Lordship argues that my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of Knowledge, weakens the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility
of the Articles of Faith: Because it
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65912:85"/>
takes away Revelation; and your Proof of
that is, because <hi>I do not know whether Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may not Think.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The same sort of Argumentation your
Lordship goes on with in the next Page,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 30.</note>
               <hi>where you say,</hi> Again, before there can be
any such thing as assurance of Faith upon divine
Revelation, there must be a Certainty as to
Sense and Tradition; for there can be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
pretended now, without immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration;
and the Basis of our Faith is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
contained in an antient Book, whereof
the parts were delivered at distant times, but
conveyed down to us by an universal Tradition.
But now, what if my grounds of Certainty can
give us no assurance as to these Things? Your
Lordship says you do not mean, That they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
demonstrate matters of Fact, which it were
most unreasonable to expect, but that these
Grounds of Certainty make all things uncertain;
for your Lordship thinks you have proved, That
this way of Ideas cannot give a satisfactory
Account, as to the Existence of the plainest Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the Sense; <hi>because Reason cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the connection between the Objects and
the Ideas.</hi> How then can we arrive to any
Certainty in perceiving those Objects by their
Ideas?</p>
            <p>All the force of which Argument lies in
this, that I have said (or am supposed to
have said, or to hold, for that I ever said
so, I do not remember) That <hi>Reason cannot
perceive the connection between the Objects and
the Ideas:</hi> Ergo, whoever holds that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
consists in the perception of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65912:86"/>
or disagreement of Ideas, cannot <hi>have
any assurance of Faith upon divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, let that Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<hi>Reason cannot perceive the connection between
the Objects and the Ideas,</hi> be mine as much
as your Lordship pleases, and let it be as
inconsistent as you please, with <hi>the assurance
of Faith upon divine Revelation;</hi> How will it
follow from thence, that the placing of
Certainty in the perception of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or disagreement of Ideas, is the Cause,
that there <hi>cannot be any such thing as the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Faith upon divine Revelation</hi> to any
Body? Though I who hold Knowledge to
consist in the perception of the agreement
and disagreement of Ideas, have the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to run into this Error, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<hi>Reason cannot perceive the connection between
the Objects and the Ideas,</hi> which is inconsistent
<hi>with the assurance of Faith upon divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
yet it is not necessary that all others
who with me hold, that Certainty consists
in the perception of the agreement or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Ideas, should also hold, <hi>That
Reason cannot perceive the connection between
the Objects and the Ideas,</hi> or that I my self
should always hold it: Unless your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
will say, that whoever places Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as I do, in the perception of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or disagreement of Ideas, must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
hold all the Errors that I <hi>do,</hi> which
are inconsistent with or weaken the belief
of any Article of Faith; and hold them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigibly.
Which has as much conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65912:86"/>
as if I should argue, that because
your Lordship who lives at <hi>Worcester</hi> does
sometime mistake in quoting me, therefore
no Body who lives at <hi>Worcester</hi> can quote my
Words right, or your Lordship can never
mend your wrong Quotations. For, my
Lord, the holding Certainty to consist in
the perception of the agreement or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ideas, is no more a necessary cause
of holding those erroneous Propositions,
which your Lordship imputes to me, as
weakening the credibility of the mentioned
Articles of Faith, than the place of your
Lordship's dwelling is a necessary cause of
wrong Quoting.</p>
            <p>I shall not here go about to trouble your
Lordship with Divining again, what may
be your Lordship's precise Meaning in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of the Propositions contained in the
Passage above set down, especially that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
ambiguous and to me obscure
one, <hi>viz. There must be a Certainty as to
Sense and Tradition.</hi> I fear I have wasted
too much of your Lordship's, and my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
time in that imployment already, and
there would be no end, if I should endeavour
to explain whatever I am at a loss about,
the determined Sense of, in any of your
Lordship's Expressions.</p>
            <p>Only I will crave leave to beg my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to observe, That in this first Head,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 27-31.</note>
which we are upon, your Lordship has used
the Terms <hi>Certain</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> near Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
times, but without determining in any
of them, whether you mean <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65912:87"/>
the <hi>full assurance of Faith,</hi> or any <hi>degree of
Believing;</hi> though it be evident, that in
these Pages your Lordship uses <hi>Certainty</hi> for
all these Three. Which ambiguous use of the
main Word in that Discourse, cannot but
render your Lordship's Sense clear and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous,
and your Argument very cogent;
and no doubt will do so to any one, who
will be but at the pains to reduce that one
Word to a clear determined Sense all through
these few Paragraphs.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Have not all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
who have talked of matters of Faith allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Certainty of Faith, as well as a Certainty
of Knowledge? Answ.</hi> But did ever any one
of <hi>all</hi> that <hi>Mankind allow</hi> it as a tolerable
way of speaking, that <hi>believing in general</hi> (for
which your Lordship has used it) which
contains in it the lowest degree of Faith,
should be called <hi>Certainty?</hi> Could he who
said, <hi>I Believe Lord, help my Vnbelief,</hi> or
any one who is <hi>weak in Faith,</hi> or <hi>of little
Faith,</hi> be properly be said to be <hi>certain,</hi> or
<hi>de dubio certus</hi> of what he believes, but
with a weak degree of Assent? I shall not
question what your Lordship's great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may Authorize: But I imagine every
one hath not skill, or will not assume the
liberty to speak so.</p>
            <p>If a Witness before a Judge asked upon
his Oath, whether he were <hi>certain</hi> of such
a thing, should answer yes, he was <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi>
and upon farther demand, should
give this account of his <hi>Certainty,</hi> That he
<hi>believed</hi> it; would he not make the Court
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65912:87"/>
and Auditors believe strangely of him? For
to say that a Man is <hi>certain,</hi> when he bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believes, and that perhaps with no
great Assurance of Faith, is to say that he
is <hi>certain,</hi> where he owns an <hi>Vncertainty.</hi>
For he that says he barely believes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
that he Assents to a Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as true, upon bare probability. And
where any one Assents thus to any Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
his Assent excludes not a possibility
that it may be otherwise; and wherein any
one's Judgment there is a possibility to
be otherwise, there one cannot deny but
there is some Uncertainty; and the less
cogent the Probabilities appear, upon which
he Assents, the greater the Uncertainty.
So that all barely probable Proofs, which
procure Assent, always containing some
visible possibility that it may be otherwise
(or else it would be demonstration) and
consequently the weaker the Probability
appears, the weaker the Assent, and the
more the Uncertainty: It thence follows,
that where there is such a mixture of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
there a Man is so far uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
and therefore to say, That a Man
is certain where he barely believes or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
but weakly, though he does believe,
seems to me to say, That he is certain and
uncertain together. But though bare Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
always include some degrees of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
yet it does not therefore neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
include any degree of wavering, the
evidently strong probability may as stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
determine the Man to Assent to the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65912:88"/>
Truth, or make him take the Proposition
for true, and act accordingly, as Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
makes him see or be certain that it is
true. And he that doth so, as to Truths
reveal'd in the Scripture, will shew his
Faith by his Works; and has, for ought
I can see, all the Faith necessary to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and requir'd to Salvation.</p>
            <p>My Lord, when I consider the length
of my Answer here, to these few Pages of
your Lordship's, I cannot but bemoan my
own dulness, and own my unfitness to
deal with so learned an Adversary as your
Lordship in Controversie: For I know
not how to answer but to a Proposition of
a determin'd Sense. Whilst it is vague and
uncertain in a general or equivocal use of
any of the Terms, I cannot tell what to
say to it. I know not but such compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
ways of expressing ones self, may
do well enough in declamation; but in
reasoning, there can be no judgment made
till one can get to some positive determined
Sense of the Speaker. If your Lordship had
pleased to have condescended so far to
my low Capacity, as to have delivered
your meaning, here determined, to any
one of the Senses above set down, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that you may have in these Words,
I gather'd them from; it would have saved
me a great deal of writing, and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
loss of time in reading. I should not
say this here to your Lordship, were it
only in this one place that I find this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience.
It is every where in all your
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65912:88"/>
Lordship's Reasonings, that my want of
Understanding causes me this difficulty,
and against my Will multiplies the words
of my Answer. For notwithstanding all
that great deal that I have already said to
these few Pages of your Lordship's; yet
my defence is not clear, and set in its due
light, unless I shew in particular of every
one of those Propositions (some whereof
I admit as true, others I deny as not so)
that it will not prove what is to be proved,
<hi>viz.</hi> That my placing of Knowledge in the
Perception of the Agreement or Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ideas, lessens the credibility of any
Article of Faith, which it had before.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship having done with the
<hi>Fundamental</hi> Articles of Natural Religion,
you come in the next place to those of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
to <hi>enquire,</hi> as your Lordship says,
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Whether those who embrace the Articles of
Faith, in the way of Ideas, can retain their
Certainty of those Articles, when these Ideas
are quitted.</hi> What this Enquiry is I know
not very well, because I neither understand
what it is to <hi>imbrace Articles of Faith in
the way of Ideas,</hi> nor know what your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
means by <hi>retaining their Certainty of
those Articles, when these Ideas are quitted.</hi>
But 'tis no strange thing for my short
Sight, not always distinctly to discern
your Lordship's meaning: Yet here I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to know that this is the thing
to be proved, <hi>viz. That my definition of
Knowledge does not leave to the Articles of
the Christian Faith, the same credibility they had
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65912:89"/>
before.</hi> The Articles your Lordship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in are,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Resurrection</hi> of the dead. And
here your Lordship proceeds just in the same
method of arguing, as you did in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
your Lordship brings several Passages
concerning Identity out of my <hi>Essay,</hi> which
you suppose inconsistent with the belief
of the Resurrection of the same Body;
and this is your Argument to prove
that my defining of Knowledge to consist
in the Perception of the Agreement or
Disagreement of Ideas, <q>alters the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this Article of Faith, and leaves it not
the same credibility it had before.</q> Now,
my Lord, granting all that your Lordship has
here<note n="*" place="margin">p. 32.</note> quoted out of my Chapter of <hi>Identity
and diversity,</hi> to be as false as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
pleases, and as inconsistent as your
Lordship would have it, with the Article
of the Resurrection from the dead; nay,
granting all the rest of my whole <hi>Essay</hi> to
be false, how will it follow from thence,
that the placing Certainty in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the Agreement or Disagreement
of Ideas, <hi>weakens the credibility</hi> of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Faith, That <hi>the dead shall rise?</hi> Let
it be, that I who place Certainty in the
Perception of the Agreement or Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ideas am guilty of Errors, that
<hi>weaken the credibility of this Article of Faith,</hi>
others who place Certainty in the same
Perception, may not run into those Errors,
and so not have their belief of this Article
at all shaken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:65912:89"/>
Your Lordship therefore, by all the long
discourse you have made here against my
Notion of <hi>Personal Identity,</hi> to prove that it
<hi>weakens the credibility of the Resurrection of the
dead;</hi> should you have proved it never so
clearly, has not, I humbly conceive, said
therein any one word towards the proving,
That my definition of Knowledge <hi>weakens
the credibility</hi> of this Article of Faith. For
this, my Lord, is the Proposition to be
proved, as your Lordship cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
if you please to recollect, what is
said in your 21st and following Pages, and
what in the 95th Page of my second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
quoted by your Lordship, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
as an answer to. And so I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the next Articles of Faith your
Lordship instances in. Your Lordship
says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 44.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The next Articles of Faith which</hi> my <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Ideas is inconsistent with, are no less
than those of the Trinity and the Incarnation
of our Saviour.</hi> Where I must humbly crave
leave to observe to your Lordship, that in
this second Head here, your Lordship has
changed the Question from <hi>my Notion of
Certainty,</hi> to <hi>my Notion of Ideas.</hi> For the
Question, as I have often had occasion to
observe to your Lordship, is, Whether <hi>my
Notion of Certainty,</hi> i. e. my placing of
Certainty in the Perception of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Disagreement of Ideas, alters the
Foundation, and lessens the credibility of
any Article of Faith? This being the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
between your Lordship and me, ought
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65912:90"/>
I humbly conceive, most especially to have
been kept close to in this Article of <hi>the
Trinity;</hi> because 'twas upon the account
of my Notion of <hi>Certainty</hi> as prejudicial to
the Doctrine of the Trinity, that my Book
was first brought into this Dispute. But
your Lordship offers nothing, that I can find,
to prove, That my definition of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or <hi>Certainty,</hi> does any way lessen the
credibility of either of the Articles here
mentioned, unless your insisting upon some
supposed Errors of mine about <hi>Nature</hi> and
<hi>Person,</hi> must be taken for proofs of this
Proposition, That my definition of <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
lessens the credibility of the <hi>Articles
of the Trinity, and our Saviour's Incarnation.</hi>
And then the Answer I have already given
to the same way of Argumentation used
by your Lordship, concerning the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of <hi>a God, Revelation,</hi> and the <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
I think may suffice.</p>
            <p>Having, as I beg leave to think, shewn
that your Lordship has not in the least
proved this Proposition, That the placing
of <hi>Certainty</hi> in the Perception of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Disagreement of Ideas, weakens
the credibility of any one Article of Faith,
which was your former Accusation against
<hi>this</hi> (as your Lordship is pleased to call it)
<hi>new Method of Certainty, of so dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to that Article of Faith which your
Lordship has endeavoured to defend;</hi> and all
that your terrible Representation of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as I humbly conceive, come to just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
I come now to vindicate my Book
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65912:90"/>
from your new Accusation in your last Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and to shew that you no more prove
the Passages you alledge out of my <hi>Essay</hi>
to have any inconsistency with the <hi>Articles
of Christian Faith</hi> you oppose them to,
than you have proved by them, That my
definition of Knowledge weakens the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility
of any of those Articles.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Article of Christian Faith</hi> your
Lordship begins with, is that <hi>of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the dead;</hi> and concerning that
you say,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 32.</note> 
               <hi>The Reason of believing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the same Body upon my Grounds,
is from the Idea of Identity. Answ.</hi> Give me
leave, my Lord, to say that the <hi>Reason of
believing</hi> any Article of the Christian Faith
(such as your Lordship is here speaking of)
to me and <hi>upon my Grounds,</hi> is its being
a part of Divine Revelation: Upon this
Ground I believed it before I either writ
that Chapter of <hi>Identity and Diversity,</hi> and
before I ever thought of those Propositions
which your Lordship quotes out of that
Chapter, and upon the same Ground I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it still; and not <hi>from my Idea of Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</hi>
This saying of your Lordship's there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
being a Proposition neither self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
nor allowed by me to be true, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
to be proved. So that your Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
failing all your large Superstructure
built thereon, comes to nothing.</p>
            <p>But my Lord, before we go any farther,
I crave leave humbly to represent to your
Lordship, That I thought you undertook
to <hi>make out</hi> that my <hi>Notion of Ideas</hi> was
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65912:91"/>
               <hi>inconsistent with the Articles of the Christian
Faith.</hi> But that which your Lordship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in here is not, that I yet know,
an <hi>Article of the Christian Faith.</hi> The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the dead,</hi> I acknowledge to be
an Article of the Christian Faith: But that
<hi>the Resurrection of the <hi>Same</hi> Body,</hi> in your
Lordship's Sense of <hi>the same Body,</hi> is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Christian Faith, is what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
I do not yet know.</p>
            <p>In the New Testament (wherein, I think,
are contained all the <hi>Articles of the Christian
Faith)</hi> I find our Saviour and the Apostles
to preach <hi>the Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> and
the <hi>Resurrection from the dead</hi> in many
places: But I do not remember any place,
where the <hi>Resurrection of the <hi>same</hi> Body,</hi> is
so much as mentioned. Nay, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
remarkable in the Case, I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in any place of the New Testament
(where the general Resurrection at the last
Day is spoken of) any such Expression as
<hi>the Resurrection of the Body,</hi> much less <hi>of the
same Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say the general Resurrection at the last
Day: Because where the Resurrection of
some particular Persons presently upon our
Saviour's Resurrection is mentioned, the
Words are,<note n="*" place="margin">27 Mat. 52, 53.</note> 
               <hi>The Graves were opened and
many Bodies of Saints, which slept, arose and
came out of the Graves after his Resurrection,
and went into the Holy City, and appeared to
many:</hi> Of which peculiar way of speaking
of this Resurrection, the Passage it self gives
a Reason in these Words, <hi>appeared to many,</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:65912:91"/>
i. e. Those <hi>who slept, appeared,</hi> so as to be
known to be risen. But this could not be
known, unless they brought with them the
Evidence, that they were those who had
been dead, whereof there were these two
Proofs, their Graves were opened, and
their Bodies not only gone out of them, but
appeared to be the same to those who had
known them formerly alive, and knew them
to be dead and buried. For if they had
been those who had been dead so long, that
all who knew them once alive, were now
gone, those to whom they appeared might
have known them to be Men; but could
not have known they were risen from the
dead: Because they never knew they had
been dead. All that by their appearing
they could have known, was that they were
so many living Strangers, of whose Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
they knew nothing. 'Twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
therefore, that they should come in
such Bodies, as might in make and size, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
appear to be the same they had before, that
they might be known to those of their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
whom they appeared to. And
it is probable they were such as were newly
dead, whose Bodies were not yet dissolved
and dissipated, and therefore 'tis particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
said here (differently from what is said
of the general Resurrection) that their <hi>Bodies
arose:</hi> Because they were the same, that
were then lying in their Graves, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before they rose.</p>
            <p>But your Lordship endeavours to prove
it must be the <hi>same Body:</hi> And let us grant,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65912:92"/>
that your Lordship, nay and others too,
think you have proved it <hi>must</hi> be the same
Body, will you therefore say, that he holds
what is inconsistent with an Article of Faith,
who having never seen this your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
interpretation of the Scripture, nor
your Reasons for the <hi>same Body,</hi> in your
sense of <hi>same Body;</hi> or, if he has seen them,
yet not understanding them, or not perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the force of them, believes what the
Scripture proposes to him, <hi>viz.</hi> That at the
last Day, <hi>the dead shall be raised,</hi> without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
whether it shall be with the very
same Bodies or no?</p>
            <p>I know your Lordship pretends not to
erect your particular interpretations of
Scripture, into Articles of Faith; and if
you do not, He that believes the <hi>dead shall
be raised,</hi> believes that Article of Faith,
which the Scripture proposes: And cannot
be accused of holding any thing <hi>inconsistent</hi>
with it, if it should happen, that what he
holds is <hi>inconsistent</hi> with another Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz. That the dead shall be raised with
the same Bodies,</hi> in you Lordship's Sense,
which I do not find proposed in Holy
Writ as an Article of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But your Lordship argues,</hi> it must be the
same Body <hi>which as you explain</hi> same Body<note n="†" place="margin">p. 34. 35.</note>
is not the same individual particles of Matter,
which were united at the point of Death. Nor
the same particles of Matter, that the Sinner
had at the time of the Commission of his Sins.
But that it must be the same material Substance
which was vitally united to the Soul here, <hi>i. e.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65912:92"/>
as I understand it, the same individual par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Matter, which were, sometime or
other during his Life here, vitally united
to his Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your first Argument to prove, that <hi>it
must be the same Body</hi> in this Sense of the
<hi>same Body,</hi> is taken<note n="†" place="margin">p. 37.</note> from these Words
of our Saviour.<note n="*" place="margin">5 John 28. 29.</note> 
               <hi>All that are in the Graves
shall hear his Voice, and shall come forth.</hi> From
whence your Lordship argues, That these
Words, <hi>all that are in their Graves, relates
to no other Substance, than what was united to
the Soul in Life;</hi> because <hi>a different Substance
cannot be said to be in the Graves, and to come
out of them.</hi> Which Words of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
if they prove any thing, prove, that
the Soul too is lodg'd in the Grave, and
raised out of it at the last Day. For your
Lordship says, <hi>Can a different Substance be
said to be in their Graves and come out of them?</hi>
So that according to this interpretation of
these Words of our Saviour; <hi>No other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
being raised, but what hears his
Voice, and <hi>no other Substance</hi> hearing his
Voice, but what being called comes out of
the Grave, and <hi>no other Substance</hi> coming
out of the Grave, but what was in the Grave,
any one must conclude, that the Soul, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be in the Grave, will make no part
of the Person that is raised, <hi>unless,</hi> as your
Lordship argues against me,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 37.</note> 
               <hi>You can make
it out, that a Substance which never was in the
Grave may come out of it,</hi> or that the Soul
is no <hi>Substance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:65912:93"/>
But setting aside the <hi>Substance</hi> of the Soul,
another thing that will make any one doubt,
whether this your Interpretation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Words be necessarily to be received
as their true Sense, is, That it will not be
very easily reconciled to your saying,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 34.</note> you
do not mean by the same Body, <hi>The same
individual Particles which were united at the
point of Death.</hi> And yet by this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of our Saviour's Words, you can mean
no other <hi>Particles,</hi> but such as were united
at the Point of Death: Because you mean
no other <hi>Substance,</hi> but what <hi>comes out of
the Grave,</hi> and no <hi>Substance,</hi> no particles
<hi>come out</hi> you say, but what were <hi>in the Grave,</hi>
and I think your Lordship will not say that
the Particles that were seperate from the
Body <hi>by perspiration,</hi> before the point of
Death, were laid up in the Grave.</p>
            <p>But your Lordship, I find, has an Answer
to this,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 37.</note> 
               <hi>viz. That by comparing this with
other places you find, that the Words,</hi> [of our
Saviour above quoted] <hi>are to be understood
of the Substance of the Body, to which the Soul
was united, and not to</hi> (I suppose your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
writ <hi>of) those individual Particles,</hi> i. e.
<hi>those individual Particles</hi> that are in the Grave,
at the Resurrection. For so they must be
read to make your Lordship's Sense entire,
and to the purpose of your Answer here:
And then methinks this last Sense of our
Saviour's Words given by your Lordship,
wholly overturns the Sense which you have
given of them above, where from those
Words you press the belief of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65912:93"/>
of the same Body, by this strong
Argument, that a <hi>Substance</hi> could not upon
hearing the Voice of Christ, <hi>come out of the
Grave, which was never in the Grave.</hi> There
(as far as I can understand your Words)
your Lordship argues, that our Saviour's
Words must be understood of the Particles
in the Grave, <hi>unless,</hi> as your Lordship says,
<hi>one can make it out that a Substance which never
was in the Grave, may come out of it.</hi> And
here your Lordship expresly says, That our
Saviour's <hi>Words are to be understood of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of that Body, to which the Soul was</hi>
[at any time] <hi>united, and not to those individual
Particles that are in the Grave.</hi> Which put
together seems to me to say, That our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Words are to be understood of those
Particles only that are in the Grave, and not
of those Particles only which are in the
Grave, but of others also which have at any
time been <hi>vitally united to the Soul,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were in the Grave.</p>
            <p>The next Text your Lordship brings to
make the <hi>Resurrection of the same Body,</hi> in
your Sense, an Article of Faith, are these
Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 10.</note> 
               <hi>For we must all appear
before the Iudgment Seat of Christ, that every
one may receive the things done in his Body,
according to that he hath done, whether it be
good or bad.</hi> To which your Lordship sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 38.</note> this Question. <hi>Can these Words be
understood of any other material Substance, but
that Body in which these things were done?
Answ.</hi> A Man may suspend his determining
the meaning of the Apostle to be, that a
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65912:94"/>
Sinner shall suffer for his Sins in the very
<hi>same Body,</hi> wherein he committed them:
Because St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not say he shall have
the very <hi>same Body,</hi> when he suffers, that
he had when he sinn'd. The Apostle says,
indeed done <hi>in <hi>his</hi> Body.</hi> The Body he had,
and did things in at Five or Fifteen, was no
doubt <hi>his <hi>Body,</hi>
               </hi> as much as that, which he
did things in at Fifty was <hi>his <hi>Body,</hi>
               </hi> though
<hi>his</hi> Body were not <hi>the very same Body</hi> at
those different Ages: And so will the Body,
which he shall have after the Resurrection,
be <hi>his <hi>Body,</hi>
               </hi> though it be not the very <hi>same</hi>
with that, which he had at Five or Fifteen
or Fifty. He that at Threescore is broke
on the Wheel, for a Murder he committed
at Twenty, is punished for what he did in
<hi>his</hi> Body, though the Body he has, <hi>i. e. his</hi>
Body at Threescore, be not the same, <hi>i. e.</hi>
made up of the same individual Particles of
Matter, that that Body was, which he had
Forty Years before. When your Lordship
has resolved with your self, what that same
immutable <hi>he</hi> is, which at the last Judgment
shall receive the things done in <hi>his</hi> Body,
your Lordship will easily see, that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
he had, when an <hi>Embryo</hi> in the Womb,
when a Child playing in Coats, when a
Man marrying a Wife, and when Bed-rid
dying of a Consumption, and at last, which
he shall have after the Resurrection, are each
of them <hi>his</hi> Body, though neither of them
be the <hi>same Body,</hi> the one with the other.</p>
            <p>But farther to your Lordship's Question,
<hi>Can these Words be understood of any other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65912:94"/>
Substance, but that Body in which these
things were done?</hi> I <hi>Answer,</hi> these Words of
St. <hi>Paul may be understood of another material
Substance, than that Body in which these things
were done,</hi> because your Lordship teaches
me, and gives me a strong Reason so to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
them. Your Lordship says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 34.</note>
That <hi>you do not say the same Particles of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which the Sinner had at the very time of
the Commission of his Sins, shall be raised at the
last Day.</hi> And your Lordship gives this
Reason for it.<note n="*" place="margin">p. 35.</note> 
               <hi>For then a long Sinner must
have a vast Body, considering the continual
spending of Particles by Perspiration.</hi> Now,
my Lord, if the Apostle's Words, as your
Lordship would argue, <hi>cannot be understood
of any other material Substance, but that Body,
in which these things were done,</hi> and no Body
upon the removal or change of some of the
Particles, that at any time makes it up is
the same material Substance, or the same
Body; it will, I think, thence follow, that
either the Sinner must have all the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Particles vitally united to his Soul,
when he is raised, that he had vitally united
to his Soul, when he sin'd: Or else St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Words here cannot be understood to mean
the <hi>same Body in which the things were done.</hi>
For if there were other Particles of Matter
in the Body, wherein the thing was done,
than in that which is raised, that which is
raised cannot be the <hi>same Body</hi> in which
they were done: Unless that alone, which
has just all the same individual Particles
when any action is done, being the same
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65912:95"/>
Body wherein it was done, that also, which
has not the same individual Particles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that Action was done, can be the same
Body wherein it was done, which is in
effect to make the same Body sometimes to
be the same, and sometimes not the same.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship thinks it suffices to make
the <hi>same Body</hi> to have not all; but no other
Particles of Matter, but such as were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
or other vitally united to the Soul
before: But such a Body made up of part
of the Particles sometime or other vitally
united to the Soul, is no more the same
Body wherein the Actions were done in the
distant parts of the <hi>long Sinner's</hi> life, than
that is the same Body in which a quarter
or half or three quarters, of the same Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
that made it up, are wanting. For
example, A Sinner has acted here in his <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
an hundred Years; he is raised at the
last day, but with what Body? The same
says your Lordship, That he acted in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
St. <hi>Paul</hi> says he must <hi>receive the things
done in <hi>his</hi> Body?</hi> What therefore must his
Body at the Resurrection consist of? Must
it consist of all the Particles of Matter,
that have ever been vitally united to his
Soul? For they, in Succession, have all of
them made up <hi>his</hi> Body, wherein he did
<hi>these things:</hi> No, says your Lordship,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 35.</note>
That would make his Body too <hi>vast;</hi> it
suffices to make the same Body in which the
things were done, that it consists of some
of the Particles, and no other but such as
were sometime during his life, vitally unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65912:95"/>
to his Soul. But according to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<hi>his</hi> Body at the Resurrection, being,
as your Lordship seems to limit it, near the
same size it was in some part of his life,
it will be no more the <hi>same Body</hi> in which <hi>the
things were done</hi> in the distant parts of his
life, than that is the <hi>same Body,</hi> in which
half or three quarters or more of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
Matter that made it then up, is
now wanting. For example, let <hi>his</hi> Body
at 50 Years old consist of a Million of
parts; five hundred thousand at least of
those parts will be different from those
which made up <hi>his</hi> Body at 10 Years, and
at an hundred. So that to take the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Particles, that made up his Body at
50, or any other season of his life; or to
gather them promiscuously out of those
which at different times have successively
been vitally united to his Soul, they will
no more make the same Body, which was
<hi>his,</hi> wherein some of his Actions were done,
than that is the same Body, which has but
half the same Particles: And yet all your
Lordship's Argument here for the same Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
is because St. <hi>Paul</hi> says it must be <hi>his</hi>
Body <hi>in which these things were done;</hi> which
it could not be, <hi>if any other Substance were
joined to it,</hi> i. e. if any other Particles of
Matter made up the Body, which were not
vitally united to the Soul, when the Action
was done.</p>
            <p>Again, your Lordship says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 34.</note> 
               <hi>That you
do not say the same individual Particles</hi> [shall
make up the Body at the Resurrection] <hi>which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65912:96"/>
were united at the point of death, for there
must be a great alteration in them of a lingring
Disease, as if a fat Man falls into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</hi>
Because 'tis likely your Lordship
thinks these Particles of a decrepit, wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
withered Body would be too few, or
unfit to make such a plump, strong, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
well-siz'd Body, as it has pleased
your Lordship to proportion out in your
Thoughts to Men at the Resurrection; and
therefore some small portion of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
formerly united vitally to that Man's
Soul, shall be re-assumed to make up his
Body to the bulk your Lordship judges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient;
but the greatest part of them
shall be left out to avoid the making his
Body more <hi>vast</hi> than your Lordship thinks
will be fit, as appears by these your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
words immediately following, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 35.</note> 
               <hi>That you do not say the same Particles the
Sinner had at the very time of Commission of
his Sins, for then a long Sinner must have a
vast Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then pray, my Lord, what must an
<hi>Embryo</hi> do, who dying within a few hours
after his Body was vitally united to his
Soul, has no Particles of Matter, which
were formerly vitally united to it, to make
up his Body of that size and proportion
which your Lordship seems to require in
Bodies at the Resurrection? Or must we
believe he shall remain content with that
small Pittance of Matter, and that yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Body to Eternity; because it is an
Article of Faith to believe the <hi>Resurrection
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65912:96"/>
of the very same Body?</hi> i. e. made up of
only such Particles, as have been vitally
united to the Soul. For if it be so, as your
Lordship says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 43.</note> 
               <hi>That life is the result of
the Vnion of Soul and Body,</hi> it will follow
That the Body of an <hi>Embryo</hi> dying in the
Womb may be very little, not the thousandth
part of any ordinary Man. For since from
the first conception and beginning of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
it has life, and <hi>life is the result of
the Vnion of the Soul with the Body;</hi> an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo,</hi>
that shall die either by the untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
death of the Mother, or by any other
accident presently after it has Life, must
according to your Lordship's Doctrin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
a Man not an inch long to Eternity;
because there are not Particles of Matter,
formerly united to his Soul, to make him
bigger; and no other can be made use of
to that purpose: Though what greater
congruity the Soul hath with any Particles
of Matter, which were once vitally united to
it, but are now so no longer; than it hath
with Particles of Matter, which it was never
united to, would be hard to determine, if
that should be demanded.</p>
            <p>By these, and not a few other the like
consequences, one may see what service
they do to Religion, and the Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,
who raise Questions, and make Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith about the <hi>Resurrection of the
same Body,</hi> where the Scripture says no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of <hi>the same Body;</hi> or if it does, it is
with no small reprimand<note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 15, 35 &amp;c.</note> to those who
make such an enquiry. <hi>But some Man will

say, How are the dead raised up? And with
what Body do they come? Thou Fool, that
which thou sowest is not quickned except it die
And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not
that Body that shall be, but bare Grain, it may
chance of Wheat or of some other Grain. But
God giveth it a Body as it hath pleased him.</hi>
Words I should think sufficient to deterr
us from determining any thing for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the same Body being raised at the
last day. It suffices, that all the <hi>dead shall
be raised,</hi> and every one appear and answer
for the things done in this life, and receive
according to the things he hath done in his
Body, whether good or bad. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
this, and has said nothing inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
herewith, I presume may, and must
be acquitted from being guilty of any thing
<hi>inconsistent with the Article of the Resurrection
of the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But your Lordship to prove <hi>the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the same Body to be an Article of Faith,</hi>
farther asks,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 38.</note> 
               <hi>How could it be said, if any
other Substance be joined to the Soul at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
as its Body, that they were the things
done in or by the Body? Answ.</hi> Just as it may
be said of a Man at an hundred Years old,
that hath then an other Substance joined to
his Soul, than he had at twenty, that the
Murder or Drunkenness he was guilty of
at twenty, <hi>were things done in the Body:</hi> How
<hi>by the Body</hi> comes in here, I do not see.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship adds, <hi>And St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
about the manner of raising the Body might
soon have ended, if there were no necessity of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65912:101"/>
the same Body. Answ.</hi> When I understand
what Argument there is in these Words to
prove the Resurrection of the same Body,
without the mixture of one new Atom of
Matter, I shall know what to say to it.
In the mean time this I understand, That
St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have put as short an end to
all disputes about this Matter, if he had
said, That <hi>there was a necessity of the same
Body,</hi> or that it should be the <hi>same Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Text of Scripture you bring
for the same Body, is,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 15. 16.</note> 
               <hi>If there be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the <hi>dead,</hi> then is not Christ raised.</hi>
From which your Lordship argues,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 38.</note> 
               <hi>It
seems then other Bodies are to be raised as his
was.</hi> I grant other dead, as certainly rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>as Christ was;</hi> for else his Resurrection
would be of no use to Mankind. But I do
not see how it follows, that they shall be
<hi>raised</hi> with the <hi>same</hi> Body, as Christ was
raised with the same Body, as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
infers in these Words annexed; <hi>And
can there be any doubt, whether his Body was
the same material Substance, which was united
to his Soul before?</hi> I answer, none at all;
nor that it had just the same undistinguish'd
Lineaments and Marks, yea, and the same
Wounds that it had at the time of his death.
If therefore your Lordship will argue from
<hi>others Bodies being raised as his was,</hi> That
they must keep proportion with his in <hi>same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
then we must believe, that every Man
shall be raised with the same Lineaments and
other Notes of distinction he had at the time
of his death, even with his Wounds yet
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65912:102"/>
open, if he had any, because our Saviour
was so raised, which seems to me scarce
reconcilable with what your Lordship says
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 34.</note> of <hi>a fat Man falling into a Consumption,</hi> and
dying.</p>
            <p>But whether it will consist or no with
your Lordship's meaning in that Place, this
to me seems a consequence that will need
to be better proved, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Bodies
must be raised the same just as our Saviours
was: Because St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>If there be no
Resurrection of the <hi>dead,</hi> then is not Christ risen.</hi>
For it may be a good consequence Christ is
risen, and therefore there shall be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the dead, and yet this may
not be a good consequence, Christ was raised
with the same Body he had at his Death,
therefore all Men shall be raised with the
same Body they had at their Death, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to what your Lordship says concerning
<hi>a fat Man</hi> dying <hi>of a Consumption.</hi> But the
Case I think far different betwixt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and those to be raised at the last
Day.</p>
            <p>1. His Body <hi>saw not Corruption,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to give him another Body, new molded
mixed with other Particles, which were
not contained in it as it lay in the Grave,
whole and entire as it was laid there, had
been to destroy his Body to frame him a new
one without any need. But why with the
remaining Particles of a Man's Body long
since dissolved and molder'd into Dust and
Atoms (whereof possibly a great part may
have undergone variety of changes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65912:102"/>
into other concretions even in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of other Men) other new Particles of
Matter mixed with them, may not serve
to make <hi>his</hi> Body again, as well as the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of new and different Particles of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with the Old, did in the compass of his
Life make <hi>his</hi> Body, I think no Reason can
be given.</p>
            <p>This may serve to shew, why though the
Materials of our Saviour's Body, were not
changed at his Resurrection: Yet it does not
follow, but that the Body of a Man dead and
rotten in his Grave, or burnt, may at the
last Day have several new Particles in it,
and that without any inconvenience. Since
whatever Matter is vitally united to <hi>his</hi> Soul,
is <hi>his</hi> Body, as much as is that, which was
united to it when he was born, or in any
other part of his Life.</p>
            <p>2. In the next place, the size, shape, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
and lineaments of our Saviour's Body,
even to his Wounds into which doubting
<hi>Thomas</hi> put his Fingers and his Hand, were
to be kept in the raised Body of our Saviour,
the same they were at his Death, to be a
conviction to his Disciples, to whom he
shew'd himself, and who were to be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of his Resurrection, that their Master,
the very same Man, was crucified, dead and
buried, and raised again; and therefore he
was handled by them, and Eat before them
after he was risen, to give them in all points
full Satisfaction, that it was really he, the
same, and not another, nor a Specter or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition
of him: Though I do not think your
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65912:103"/>
Lordship will thence argue, that because <hi>others
are to be raised as he was,</hi> therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to believe, that because he Eat after
his Resurrection, others at the last Day,
shall Eat and Drink after they are raised
from the dead, which seems to me as good
an Argument, as because his undissolved
Body was raised out of the Grave, just as it
there lay intire, without the mixture of
any new Particles; therefore the corrupted
and consumed Bodies of the dead at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
shall be new framed only out
of those scatter'd Particles, which were
once vitally united to their Souls, without
the least mixture of any one single Atom
of new Matter. But at the last Day, when
all Men are raised, there will be no need to
be assured of any one particular Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.
'Tis enough that every one
shall appear before the Judgement-seat of
Christ, to receive according to what he had
done in his former Life; but in what sort
of Body he shall appear, or of what Particles
made up the Scripture, having said nothing,
but that it shall be a <hi>spiritual Body raised in
incorruption,</hi> it is not for me to determine.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship asks,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 39.</note> 
               <hi>were they</hi> [who
saw our Saviour after his Resurrection] <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
only of some material Substance then united
to his Soul?</hi> In Answer, I beg your Lordship
to consider, whether you suppose our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
was to be known to be the same Man
(to the Witnesses that were to see him, and
testifie his Resurrection) by his Soul, that
could neither be seen, nor known to be the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65912:103"/>
same; or by his Body, that could be seen,
and by the discernible structure and marks
of it, be known to be the same? When
your Lordship has resolved that; all that
you say in that Page, will answer it self.
But because one Man cannot know another
to be the same, but by the outward visible
lineaments, and sensible marks he has been
wont to be known and distinguished by;
will your Lordship therefore argue, That
the great Judge, at the last Day, who gives
to each Man, whom he raises, his new Body,
shall not be able to know, who is who, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he give to every one of them a Body,
just of the same figure, size and features,
and made up of the very same individual
Particles he had in his former Life? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such a way of arguing for <hi>the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the same Body, to be an Article of Faith,</hi>
contributes much to the strengthening the
credibility of the Article of the Resurrection
of the dead, I shall leave to the Judgment
of others.</p>
            <p>Farther, for the proving <hi>the Resurrection
of the same Body, to be an Article of Faith,</hi>
your Lordship says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 40.</note> 
               <hi>But the Apostle insists
upon the</hi> Resurrection of Christ, <hi>not meerly
as an Argument of the possibility of ours, but
of the Certainty of it;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor: 15. 20, 23.</note> 
               <hi>because</hi> he rose, as
the First-fruits; Christ the First fruits, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
they that are Christs at his coming.
<hi>Answ.</hi> No doubt <hi>the Resurrection of Christ,</hi>
is a Proof of the <hi>certainty of our</hi> Resurrection.
But is it therefore a Proof of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>same Body,</hi> consisting of the same
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65912:104"/>
individual Particles which concurr'd to the
making up of our Body here, without the
mixture of any one other Particle of Matter?
I confess I see no such consequence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But your Lordship goes on,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 40.</note> 
               <hi>St.</hi> Paul
was aware of the Objections in Mens Minds,
about the Resurrection of the same Body; and it
is of great consequence as to this Article, to
shew upon what Grounds he proceeds. <hi>But some
Man will say, How are the <hi>dead</hi> raised up,
and with what Body do <hi>they</hi> come?</hi> First he
shews, That the seminal parts of Plants are
wonderfully improved by the ordinary Providence
of God, in the manner of their Vegetation.
Answ. <hi>I do not perfectly understand, what
it is for the</hi> seminal parts of Plants to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
improved by the ordinary Providence
of God, in the manner of their Vegetation:
<hi>Or else perhaps I should better see, how
this here tends to the proof of</hi> the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the same Body, <hi>in your Lordship's
Sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It continues,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 40.</note> 
               <hi>They</hi> Sow bare Grain of
Wheat, or of some other Grain, but God
giveth it a Body, as it hath pleased him,
and to every Seed his own Body. <hi>Here,</hi>
says your Lordship, <hi>is an Identity of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Substance supposed.</hi> It may be so. But
to me a diversity <hi>of the material Substance,</hi>
i. e. of the component Particles <hi>is here sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,</hi>
or in direct Words said. For the
Words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> taken all together, run
thus,<note n="*" place="margin">v. 37.</note> 
               <hi>That which thou sowest, thou sowest not
<hi>that</hi> Body which shall be, but bare Grain,</hi> and
so on, as your Lordship has set down the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65912:104"/>
remainder of them. From which Words
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the natural Argument seems
to me to stand thus. If the Body that is
put in the Earth in sowing, <hi>is not <hi>that</hi> Body
which shall be,</hi> then the Body that is put in
the Grave, <hi>is not</hi> that, i. e. the same, <hi>Body
that shall be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But your Lordship proves it to be the
<hi>same Body,</hi> by these three Greek Words of
the Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which your Lordship
interprets thus,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 40.</note> 
               <hi>That proper Body which
belongs to it. Answ.</hi> Indeed by those Greek
Words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> whether our Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
have rightly render'd them <hi>his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
or your Lordship more rightly, <hi>that
proper Body which belongs to it,</hi> I formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
no more but this, that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of Wheat and other Grain from
Seed, God continued every Species distinct,
so that from Grains of Wheat sown, root,
stalk, blade, ear and grains of Wheat were
produced, and not those of Barly; and so
of the rest, which I took to be the meaning
of <hi>to every Seed his own Body.</hi> No says your
Lordship, these Words prove, That to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Plant of Wheat, and to every Grain of
Wheat produced in it is given, <hi>the proper
Body that belongs to it,</hi> is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the same Body,
with the Grain that was sown. <hi>Answ.</hi> This,
I confess, I do not understand: Because I
do not understand how one individual Grain
can be the <hi>same,</hi> with Twenty, Fifty, or
an Hundred individual Grains, for such
sometimes is the increase.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:65912:105"/>
               <hi>But your Lordship proves it. For says
your Lordship,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 40.</note> Every Seed having that
Body in little, which is afterwards so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged;
and in Grain the Seed is corrupted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its Germination; but it hath its proper
organical Parts, which make it the same Body,
with that which it grows up to. For although
Grain be not divided into Lobes as other Seeds
are, yet it hath been found, by the most accurate
Observations, that upon separating the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes
these seminal parts are discerned in them;
which afterwards grow up to that Body which
we call Corn. <hi>In which Words I crave
leave to observe, that your Lordship sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
that a Body may be</hi> enlarged <hi>by the
addition of a Hundred or a Thousand times
as much in bulk as its own matter, and yet
continue the</hi> same Body, <hi>which I confess, I
cannot understand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the next place, if that could be so;
and that the Plant in its full growth at Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
increased by a Thousand or a Million
of times as much new Matter added to it,
as it had, when it lay in little concealed in
the Grain that was sown, was the very
same Body: Yet I do not think, that your
Lordship will say, that every minute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
and inconceivably small Grain of
the hundred Grains, contained in that little
organized senimal Plant, is every one of
them the very same, with that Grain which
contains that whole little senimal Plant,
and all those invisible Grains in it. For
then it will follow, that One Grain is the
same with an Hundred, and an Hundred
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65912:105"/>
distinct Grains the same with one: Which I
shall be able to assent to, when I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that all the Wheat in the World is
but one Grain.</p>
            <p>For I beseech you, my Lord, consider
what it is St. <hi>Paul</hi> here speaks of! It is plain
he speaks of <hi>that which is sown and dies,</hi> i. e.
the Grain, that the Husbandman takes out
of his Barn to sow in his Field. And of this
Grain, St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, that it <hi>is not <hi>that</hi> Body
that shall be.</hi> These Two, <hi>viz. That which
is sown,</hi> and <hi>that Body that shall be,</hi> are all
the Bodies that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here speaks of, to
represent the agreement or difference of
Mens Bodies after the Resurrection, with
those they had before they died. Now I
crave leave to ask your Lordship, which
of these Two is that little invisible seminal
Plant, which your Lordship here speaks of?
Does your Lordship mean by it the Grain
<hi>that is sown?</hi> But that is not what St. <hi>Paul</hi>
speaks of, he could not mean this <hi>embryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi>
little Plant, for he could not denote
it by these Words, <hi>that which thou sowest,</hi>
for that he says must <hi>die:</hi> But this little
<hi>embryonated</hi> Plant, contained in the Seed
that is sown, dies not: Or does your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
mean by it, <hi>the Body that shall be?</hi> But
neither by these Words, <hi>the Body that shall
be,</hi> can St. <hi>Paul</hi> be supposed to denote this
insensible little <hi>embryonated</hi> Plant; for that
is already in being contained in the Seed
that is sown, and therefore could not be
spoke of, under the name of <hi>the Body that
shall be,</hi> And therefore, I confess, I cannot
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65912:106"/>
see of what use it is to your Lordship to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
here this third Body, which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
mentions not; and to make that the same
or not the same with any other, when those
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, are, as I humbly
conceive, these two visible sensible Bodies,
the Grain sown, and the Corn grown up to
Ear, with neither of which this insensible
<hi>embryonated</hi> Plant can be the same Body,
unless an insensible Body can be the same
Body with a sensible Body, and a little
Body can be the same Body with one ten
thousand or an hundred thousand times as
big as its self. So that yet I confess I see
not the <hi>Resurrection of the same Body</hi> proved
from these words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to be an
<hi>Article of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship goes on,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 41.</note> 
               <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
saith,</hi> That we sow not that Body that
shall be; <hi>but he speaks not of the</hi> Identity <hi>but
the</hi> Perfection <hi>of it.</hi> Here my Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fails me again. For I cannot understand
St. <hi>Paul</hi> to say, That the same Identical
sensible grain of Wheat, which was sown
at seed-time, is the very same with
every grain of Wheat in the Ear at Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
that sprang from it: Yet so I must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it to make it prove, That the same
sensible Body, that is laid in the Grave, shall
be the very same with that, which shall be
raised at the Resurrection. For I do not
know of any seminal <hi>Body in little,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the dead Carcass of any Man or
Woman, which, as your Lordship says, in
Seeds, having its proper Organical parts,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65912:106"/>
shall <hi>afterwards be enlarged,</hi> and at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
grow up into the <hi>same Man.</hi> For
I never thought of any Seed or <hi>Seminal
parts,</hi> either of <hi>Plant</hi> or Animal <hi>so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
improved by the Providence of God,</hi>
whereby the same Plant or Animal should
beget it self; nor ever heard, that it was
by Divine <hi>Providence</hi> designed to produce
the same individual, but for the producing
of future and distinct individuals, for the
continuation of the same Species.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's next Words are,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 41.</note> 
               <hi>And
although there be such a difference from the
Grain it self, when it comes up to be perfect
Corn, with Root, Stalk, Blade, and Ear, that
it may be said to outward appearance not to
be the same Body; yet with regard to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
and Organical parts, it is as much the same
as a Man grown up, is the same with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo
in the Womb. Answ.</hi> It does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by any thing I can find in the Text,
That St. <hi>Paul</hi> here compared the <hi>Body,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
with the <hi>Seminal and Organical parts,</hi>
contained in the Grain it sprang from, but
with the whole sensible Grain that was sown.
Microscopes had not then discovered the
little <hi>Embryo</hi> plant in the Seed, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it should have been reavealed to St.
<hi>Paul</hi> (though in the Scripture we find little
Revelation of natural Philosophy) yet an
Argument taken from a thing perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whom he writ to,
could be of no manner of use to them; nor
serve at all either to instruct or convince them.
But granting that those St. <hi>Paul</hi> writ to,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65912:107"/>
knew it as well as Mr. <hi>Lewenhooke;</hi> yet your
Lordship thereby proves not the raising of
<hi>the same Body:</hi> Your Lordship says it is as
much the <hi>same</hi> [I crave leave to add <hi>Body]
as a Man grown up is the</hi> same. (<hi>Same,</hi> what
I beseech your Lordship?) <hi>with the Embryo
in the Womb.</hi> For that the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo</hi>
in the Womb, and <hi>Body</hi> of the Man
grown up, is the <hi>same Body,</hi> I think no one
will say; unless he can perswade himself
that a <hi>Body</hi> that is not the hundredth part of
an other, is the same with that other,
which I think no one will do, till having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
this dangerous <hi>way by Ideas</hi> of
Thinking and Reasoning, he has learnt to
say that a part and the whole are the <hi>same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship goes on,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 41.</note> 
               <hi>And although
many Arguments may be used to prove, that a
Man is not the same, because Life which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the course of the Blood, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Respiration, and Nutrition is so different
in both States; yet that Man would be thought
ridiculous that should seriously affirm, That it
was not the <hi>same Man.</hi>
               </hi> And your Lordship
says, <hi>I grant that the variation of great Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of Matter in Plants, alters not the Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity:
And that the Organization of the parts in
one coherent Body, partaking of one common
Life, makes the Identity of a Plant. Answ.</hi>
My Lord, I think the Question is not about
the <hi>same Man</hi> but the <hi>same Body.</hi> For tho'
I do say,<note n="*" place="margin">Essay B. 2. C. 27. § 4.</note> (somewhat differently from
what your Lordship sets down as my words
here) <q>That that which has such an Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization,

Nourishment, so as to continue and
frame the Wood, Bark and Leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
of a Plant, in which consists the vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Life, continues to be the same Plant,
as long as it partakes of the same Life,
though that Life be communicated to
new Particles of Matter, vitally united
to the living Plant.</q> Yet I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that I any where say, That a
Plant, which was once no bigger than an
Oaten straw, and afterwards grows to be
above a Fathom about, is the <hi>same Body,</hi>
though it be still the <hi>same Plant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The well known Tree in <hi>Epping</hi> Forest

the fame Oak, the very <hi>same Plant;</hi> but
no body, I think, will say it was the <hi>same
Body</hi> when it weighed a Tun, as it was
when it weighed but an Ounce, unless he
has a mind to signalize himself by saying,
That that is the <hi>same Body,</hi> which has a

no better than to say, That a thousand dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Particles are but one and the same
Particle, and one and the same Particle is a

times a greater absurdity, than to say half
is the whole, or the whole is the same with

little, which was <hi>afterwards</hi> (as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
expresses it) so <hi>much enlarged,</hi> as to
make that mighty Tree. For this <hi>Embryo,</hi>
if I may so call it, or Oak in little, being
not the hundredth, or perhaps the thousandth
part of the Acorn, and the Acorn being not
the thousandth part of the grown Oak, 'twill
be very extraordinary to prove the Acorn
and the grown Oak to be the <hi>same Body,</hi>
by a way wherein it cannot be pretended,
that above one Particle of an hundred
Thousand or a Million, is the same in the
one Body, that was in the other. From
which way of Reasoning, it will follow
that a Nurse and her Sucking-child have the
same Body; and be past doubt, that a Mother
and her Infant have the same Body. But this
is a way of <hi>Certainty</hi> found out to establish
the Articles of Faith, and to overturn the
new <hi>Method of Certainty</hi> that your Lordship
says I have <hi>started, which is apt to leave Mens
Minds more doubtful than before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I desire your Lordship to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of what use it is to you in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Case to quote out of my <hi>Essay</hi> these
Words, <q>That partaking of one common
Life, makes the Identity of a Plant,</q>
since the Question is not about the <hi>Identity
of a Plant,</hi> but about the <hi>Identity of a Body.</hi>
It being a very different thing to be the <hi>same
Plant,</hi> and to be the <hi>same Body.</hi> For that
which makes the same Plant, does not make
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65912:112"/>
the same Body; the one being the partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the same continued vegetable life,
the other the consisting of the same nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Particles of Matter. And therefore
your Lordship's inference from my Words
above quoted, in these which you subjoin,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 42.</note> seems to me a very strange one, <hi>viz. So
that in things capable of any sort of Life, the
Identity is consistent with a continued succession
of Parts; and so the Wheat grown up is the
<hi>same Body</hi> with the Grain that was sown.</hi>
For I believe if my Words, from which you
infer, <hi>and so the Wheat grown up is the <hi>same
Body</hi> with the Grain that was sown,</hi> were put
into a Syllogism, this would hardly be
brought to be the Conclusion.</p>
            <p>But your Lordship goes on with conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
upon consequence, though I have
not Eyes acute enough every where to see
the connection, till you bring it to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the <hi>same Body.</hi> The conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of your Lordship's Words<note n="*" place="margin">p. 41.</note> are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth;
<hi>And thus the alteration of the parts
of the Body at the Resurrection is consistent with
its Identity, if its Organization and Life be the
same; and this is a real Identity of the Body
which depends not upon consciousness. From
whence it follows, that to make the <hi>same Body,</hi>
no more is requir'd but restoring life to the
organiz'd parts of it.</hi> If the Question were
about raising the same Plant, I do not say
but there might be some appearance for
making such inference from my Words as
this, <hi>Whence it follows, that to make the same</hi>
Plant, <hi>no more is required, but to restore life
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65912:113"/>
to the organized parts of it.</hi> But this dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
wherein from those Words of mine
that speak only of the <hi>Identity of a Plant,</hi>
your Lordship infers there is no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to make the the <hi>same Body</hi> than to make
the <hi>same Plant,</hi> being too subtle for me,
I leave to my Reader to find out.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship goes on and says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 42.</note> 
               <hi>That
I grant likewise,</hi> 
               <q>That the Identity of the
same Man consists in a participation of
the same continued life, by constantly
fleeting particles of Matter in succession,
vitally united to the same organized Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</q>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I speak in these Words of
the <hi>Identity of the same</hi> Man, and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
thence roundly concludes; <hi>so that there
is no difficulty of the sameness of the</hi> Body.
But your Lordship knows that I do not
take these two sounds <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> to
stand for the same thing; nor the Identity
of the <hi>Man</hi> to be the same with the Identity
of the <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us read out your Lordship's
Words,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 42.</note> 
               <hi>So that there is no difficulty as to
the sameness of the Body, if life were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and if by divine Power life be restored
to that material Substance which was before
united by a Re-union of the Soul to it, there
is no Reason to deny the Identity of the Body.
Not from the Consciousness of the Soul, but
from that Life which is the Result of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Soul and Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I understand your Lordship right, you
in these Words from the Passages above
quoted out of my Book argue, that from
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65912:113"/>
those Words of mine it will follow, That
it is or may be the <hi>same Body,</hi> that is raised
at the Resurrection. If so, my Lord, your
Lordship has then proved, That my Book is
not inconsistent with, but conformable to
this Article of the <hi>Resurrection of the same
Body,</hi> which your Lordship contends for,
and will have to be an Article of Faith:
For though I do by no means deny that the
<hi>same</hi> Bodies shall be raised at the last day,
yet I see nothing your Lordship has said
to prove it to be an Article of Faith.</p>
            <p>But your Lordship goes on with your
proofs and says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 43.</note> 
               <hi>But St.</hi> Paul <hi>still supposes
that it must be that material Substance to which
the Soul was before united. For saith he,</hi> It
is sown in Corruption, it is raised in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption;
It is sown in Dishonour, it is
raised in Glory; It is sown in Weakness,
it is raised in Power; It is sown a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Body, it is raised a Spiritual Body.
<hi>Can such a material Substance which was never
united to the Body, be said to be</hi> sown <hi>in</hi>
Corruption, <hi>and</hi> Weakness, <hi>and</hi> Dishonour?
<hi>Either therefore he must speak of the same
Body, or his meaning cannot be comprehended.</hi>
I answer, <hi>Can such a material Substance which
was</hi> never laid in the Grave, <hi>be said to be
sown,</hi> &amp;c? For your Lordship says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 34.</note> 
               <hi>You
do not say the same individual Particles, which
were united at the point of death, shall be
raised at the last day;</hi> and no other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
are laid in the Grave, but such as
are united at the point of death, <hi>either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Lordship must speak</hi> of an other <hi>Body</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:65912:114"/>
different from that which was <hi>sown,</hi> which
shall be raised, <hi>or else</hi> your <hi>meaning,</hi> I think,
<hi>cannot be comprehended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whatever be your meaning, your
Lordship proves it to be St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That the <hi>same Body</hi> shall be raised which
was <hi>sown,</hi> in these following Words,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 43.</note> 
               <hi>For
what does all this relate to a conscious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
Answ.</hi> The Scripture being express,
That the same Persons should be raised and
appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ,
that every one may receive according to
what he had done in his Body; it was very
well suited to common Apprehensions,
(which refined not about <hi>Particles that had
been vitally united to the Soul</hi>) to speak of
the Body which each one was to have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Resurrection, as he would be apt
to speak of it himself. For it being <hi>his</hi>
Body both before and after the Resurrection,
every one ordinarily speaks of <hi>his</hi> Body as
the same, though in a strict and philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
sense, as your Lordship speaks, it
be not the very same. Thus it is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety
of Speech to say, This Body of
mine, which was formerly strong and
plump, is now weak and wasted, though
in such a Sense a you are speaking in here,
it be not the same Body, Revelation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
nothing any where concerning <hi>the
same Body,</hi> in your Lordship's Sense of <hi>the
same Body,</hi> which appears not to have been
then thought of. The Apostle directly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
nothing for or against <hi>the same Body,</hi>
as necessary to be believed: That which he
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65912:114"/>
is plain and direct in, is his opposing and
condemning such curious Questions about
the Body, which could serve only to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex,
not to confirm what was material and
necessary for them to believe, <hi>viz.</hi> a Day
of Judgment and Retribution to Men in a
future state, and therefore 'tis no wonder
that mentioning their Bodies he should use
a way of speaking suited to vulgar Notions,
from which it would be hard positively to
conclude any thing for the determining of
this Question (especially against Expressions
in the same Discourse that plainly incline
to the other side) in a matter, which as it
appears, the Apostle thought not necessary
to determin. And the Spirit of God thought
not fit to gratifie any ones curiosity in.</p>
            <p>But your Lordship says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 43.</note> 
               <hi>The Apostle
speaks plainly of that Body which was once quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened,
and afterwards falls to Corruption, and
is to be restor'd with more noble Qualities.</hi> I
wish your Lordship had quoted the Words
of St. <hi>Paul, wherein he</hi> speaks plainly of that
numerical <hi>Body that was once quickened,</hi> they
would presently decide this Question. But
your Lordship proves it by these following
Words of St. <hi>Paul. For this Corruption must
put on Incorruption, and this Mortal must put
on Immortality,</hi> to which your Lordship adds,
That <hi>you do not see how he could more expresly
affirm the identity of this corruptible Body, with
that after the Resurrection.</hi> How expressly
it is affirmed by the Apostle, shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
by and by. In the mean time it is
past doubt that your Lordship best knows
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65912:115"/>
what you do or <hi>do not see.</hi> But this I will
be bold to say, that if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had any where
in this Chapter (where there are so many
occasions for it, if it had been necessary to
have been believed) but said in express
Words, that the <hi>same Bodies</hi> should be
raised, every one else who thinks of it, will
<hi>see</hi> he had <hi>more expresly affirmed the Identity</hi>
of the Bodies which Men now have, with
those they shall have after the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</p>
            <p>The remainder of your Lordship's Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 44.</note> is. <hi>And that without any respect to the
principle of Self-consciousness. Answ.</hi> These
Words, I doubt not, have some meaning,
but I must own, I know not what; either
towards the Proof of <hi>the Resurrection of the
same Body,</hi> or to shew, that any thing I have
said concerning <hi>Self-consciousness,</hi> is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent:
For I do not remember that I have
any where said, That the <hi>Identity</hi> of <hi>Body</hi>
consisted in <hi>Self-consciousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From your preceding Words, your
Lordship concludes thus.<note n="†" place="margin">p. 44.</note> 
               <hi>And so if the
Scripture be the sole Foundation of our Faith,
this is an Article of it.</hi> My Lord, to make
the conclusion unquestionable, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
the Words must run thus. And so
if <hi>the Scripture</hi> and your Lordship's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of it, <hi>be the sole Foundation of our
Faith;</hi> the Resurrection of the same Body
<hi>is an Article of it.</hi> For with submission,
your Lordship has neither produced express
Words of Scripture for it, nor so proved,
that to be the meaning of any of those
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65912:115"/>
Words of Scripture which you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
for it, that a Man who reads and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
endeavours to understand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
cannot but find himself obliged to
believe, as expresly that <hi>the same Bodies of
the dead,</hi> in your Lordship's Sense, shall be
raised, as that <hi>the dead shall be raised.</hi> And
I crave leave to give your Lordship this one
Reason for it.</p>
            <p>He who reads with attention this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> where he discourses of
the Resurrection, will see, that he plainly
distinguishes between <hi>the dead</hi> that shall be
raised, and <hi>the Bodies</hi> of the dead. For it is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are the nominative Cases to<note n="†" place="margin">v. 15. 22, 23, 29. 32, 35, 52.</note>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> all along,
and not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Bodies,</hi> which one may with
Reason think would somewhere or other
have been expressed, if all this had been
said, to propose it as an Article of Faith,
that the very same Bodies should be raised.
The same manner of speaking the Spirit of
God observes all through the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where it is said,<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 22. 3. Mark 12. 26. John 5. 21. Acts 26. Rom. 4. 17 2 Cor. 1. 9 1 Thes. 4. 14, 16.</note> raise the <hi>dead,
quicken</hi> or make alive the <hi>dead,</hi> the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>deads</hi> Nay, these very Words
of our Saviour<note n="†" place="margin">John 5. 28, 29.</note>, urged by your Lordship,
for the Resurrection of the <hi>same Body,</hi> run
thus. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Would a well-meaning
Searcher of the Scriptures be apt to think,
that if the thing here intended by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
were to teach, and propose it as an
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65912:116"/>
Article of Faith, necessary to be believed
by every one, that the very <hi>same Bodies of
the dead</hi> should be raised, would not, I say,
any one be apt to think, that if our Saviour
meant so, the Words should rather have
been, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e.
all the Bodies that <hi>are in the Graves,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than <hi>all who are in the Graves;</hi> which
must denote Persons, and not precisely
Bodies?</p>
            <p>Another Evidence, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes a
distinction between <hi>the dead</hi> and the <hi>Bodies
of the dead,</hi> so that the dead cannot be taken
in this, 1 <hi>Cor. Ch.</hi> 15. to stand precisely for
the Bodies of the dead, are these Words of
the Apostle,<note n="†" place="margin">v. 35.</note> 
               <hi>But some Men will say, How
are the <hi>dead</hi> raised, and with what <hi>Bodies</hi> do
<hi>they</hi> come?</hi> Which words <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>they,</hi> if
supposed to stand precisely for the <hi>Bodies</hi>
of the dead, the Question will run thus.
<hi>How are the dead</hi> Bodies <hi>raised, and with what
Bodies do</hi> the dead Bodies <hi>come?</hi> Which
seems to have no very agreeable Sense.</p>
            <p>This therefore being so, that the Spirit
of God keeps so expresly to this Phrase, or
form of Speaking in the New Testament, of
<hi>raising, quickening, rising, resurrection,</hi> &amp;c.
of the <hi>dead,</hi> where the Resurrection at the
last Day is spoken of; and that the Body
is not mentioned, but in Answer to this
Question, <hi>with what Bodies shall those dead,</hi>
who are raised <hi>come?</hi> so that by the dead
cannot precisely be meant <hi>the dead Bodies:</hi>
I do not see but a good Christian, who
reads the Scripture, with an intention to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65912:116"/>
believe all, that is there revealed to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Resurrection, may acquit himself
of his Duty therein, without entring into
the enquiry whether the dead shall have the
<hi>very same Bodies</hi> or no, which sort of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
the Apostle, by the Appellation he
bestows here on him that makes it, seems
not much to incourage. Nor, if he shall
think himself bound to determine concerning
the Identity of the Bodies of the dead raised
at the last Day, will he, by the remainder
of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Answer, find the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Apostle, to be much in favour
of the very <hi>same Body,</hi> unless the being
told, that the Body sown <hi>is not that Body that
shall be?</hi> That the Body raised is as different
from that which was laid down, as the <hi>Flesh
of Man</hi> is from the <hi>Flesh</hi> of <hi>Beasts, Fishes</hi> and
<hi>Birds,</hi> or as the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
one from another, or as different as
a corruptible, weak, natural, mortal Body,
is from an incorruptible, powerful, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
immortal Body; and lastly, as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
as a Body, that is <hi>Flesh and Blood</hi> is
from a Body, that is not Flesh and Blood.
For <hi>Flesh and Blood cannot,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in
this very place<note n="*" place="margin">v. 50.</note> 
               <hi>inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi>
unless, I say, all this, which is contained
in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, can be supposed to
be the way to deliver this as an Article of
Faith, which is required to be believed
by every one, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>dead should be
raised with the very same Bodies, that they had
before in this Life;</hi> which Article proposed
in these or the like plain and express Words
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65912:117"/>
could have left no room for doubt, in the
meanest Capacities; nor for contest in the
most perverse Minds.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship adds, in the next Words.
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 44.</note> 
               <hi>And so it hath been always understood by the
Christian Church,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Resurrection
of the same Body,</hi> in your Lordship's Sense
of <hi>same Body, is an Article of Faith. Answ.</hi>
What the <hi>Christian Church has always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood</hi>
is beyond my Knowledge. But for
those who coming short of your Lordship's
great Learning, cannot gather their Articles
of Faith from the understanding of all the
whole Christian Church, ever since the
Preaching of the Gospel (who make the far
greater part of Christians, I think I may say,
Nine hundred ninety and nine of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand)
but are forced to have recourse to the
Scripture to find them there, I do not see,
that they will easily find there this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
as an Article of Faith, that there shall
be <hi>a Resurrection of the same Body;</hi> but that
there shall be <hi>a Resurrection of the dead,</hi>
without explicitly determining, That they
shall be raised with Bodies made up wholly
of the same Particles which were once vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
united to their Souls, in their former
Life; without the mixture of any one other
Particle of Matter, which is that which your
Lordship means by the <hi>same Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But supposing your Lordship to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
this to be an Article of Faith,
though I crave leave to own, that I do not
see, that all that your Lordship has said
here, makes it so much as probable; What
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65912:117"/>
is all this to me? Yes says your Lordship
in the following Words,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 44.</note> 
               <hi>My Idea of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Identity is inconsistent with it, for it makes
the same Body which was here united to the Soul,
not to be necessary to the Doctrin of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
But any material Substance united to
the same Principle of consciousness makes the
same Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is an Argument of your Lordship's,
which I am obliged to Answer to. But
is it not fit I should first understand it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I Answer it? Now here I do not well
know, what it is <hi>to make a thing not to be
necessary to the Doctrin of the Resurrection.</hi> But
to help my self out the best I can, with a
guess, I will conjecture (which in disputing
with learned Men, is not very safe) your
Lordship's meaning is, That <hi>my Idea of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>personal
Identity makes it not necessary,</hi> that for
the raising the same Person the Body should
be the same.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's next Word is <hi>But,</hi> to
which I am ready to reply, <hi>But</hi> what?
What does <hi>my</hi> Idea of personal Identity
do? For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> something of that kind the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versative
Particle <hi>But</hi> should in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
construction of our Language, introduce
to make the Proposition clear and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
But here is no such thing, <hi>But</hi> is one
of your Lordship's priviledged Particles,
which I must not medle with, for fear your
Lordship complain of me again, as so <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
a Critick,</hi> that <hi>for the least Ambiguity
in any Particle, fill up Pages in my Answer,
to make my Book look considerable for the bulk
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65912:118"/>
of it.</hi> But since this Proposition here, <hi>my
Idea of personal Identity makes the same Body
which was here united to the Soul, not necessary
to the Doctrin of the Resurrection. <hi>But</hi> any
material Substance being united to the same
Principle of Consciousness makes the same Body,</hi>
is brought to prove <hi>my Idea of personal Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
inconsistent</hi> with the Article of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection;
I must make it out in some
direct Sense or other, that I may see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be both true and conclusive. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
venture to read it thus, <hi>my Idea of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Identity makes the same Body which was
here united to the Soul, not to be necessary</hi> at
the Resurrection; <hi>but</hi> allows, That <hi>any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Substance being united to the same prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Consciousness, makes the same Body,</hi>
Ergo, <hi>my Idea of personal Identity, is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the Article of the Resurrection of the
same Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this be your Lordship's Sense in this
Passage, as I here have guessed it to be,
or else I know not what it is. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>my Idea of Personal Identity</hi> does
not allow that <hi>any material Substance being
united to the same Principle of consciousness
makes the same Body.</hi> I say no such thing
in my Book, nor any thing from whence
it may be infer'd; and your Lordship would
have done me a favour to have set down
the Words where I say so, or those from
which you infer so, and shew'd how it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
from any thing I have said.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:65912:118"/>
2. Granting that it were a consequence
from <hi>my Idea of Personal Identity,</hi> that <hi>any
material Substance being united to the same
Principle of consciousness makes the same Body;</hi>
this would not prove that <hi>my Idea of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Identity was inconsistent</hi> with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<hi>That the same Body shall be raised;</hi>
but on the contrary, affirms it: Since if I
affirm, as I do, That the same Persons
shall be raised, and it be a consequence
of my Idea of Personal Identity, that <hi>any
material Substance being united to the same
Principle of consciousness makes the same Body;</hi>
it follows, that if the same Person be raised,
the same Body must be raised; and so I
have herein not only said nothing inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with the Resurrection of the same
Body, but have said more for it than your
Lordship. For there can be nothing plainer,
than that in the Scripture it is reaveled,
That the same Persons shall be raised, and
appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ,
to answer for what they have done in their
Bodies. If therefore <hi>whatever Matter</hi> be
joined to the same Principle of Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
make the same Body; it is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
That if the same Persons are rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they have the same Bodies.</p>
            <p>How then your Lordship makes this an
inconsistency with the Resurrection, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my conception. Yes, says your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,<note place="margin">p. 44.</note>
               <hi>it is inconsistent with it, for it makes the
same Body which was here united to the Soul,
not to be necessary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:65912:119"/>
3. I answer therefore Thirdly, That this
is the first time I ever learnt, That not
<hi>necessary</hi> was the same with <hi>inconsistent.</hi> I
say that a Body made up of the same nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
parts of Matter, is not necessary
to the making of the same Person; from
whence it will indeed follow, that to the
Resurrection of the same Person, the same
numerical Particles of Matter are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
What does your Lordship infer
from hence? to wit, this. Therefore he
who thinks that the same Particles of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
are not necessary to the making of the
same Person, cannot believe, that the same
Persons shall be raised with Bodies made of
the very same Particles of Matter, if God
should reveal, that it shall be so, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the same Persons shall be raised with the
same Bodies they had before. Which is
all one as to say, That he who thought
the blowing of Rams Horns, was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in it self to the falling down of the
Walls of <hi>Iericho,</hi> could not believe, that
they should fall upon the blowing of Rams
Horns, when God had declared it should
be so.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship says, <hi>My Idea of Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Identity, is inconsistent with the Article of
the Resurrection;</hi> the Reason you ground it
on is this, because it makes not the same
Body <hi>necessary</hi> to the making the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Let us grant your Lordship's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to be good, what will follow from
it? No less than this, That your Lordship's
Notion (for I dare not say your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65912:119"/>
has any so dangerous things as <hi>Ideas</hi>)
of Personal Identity, is inconsistent with
<hi>the Article of the Resurrection.</hi> The demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of it is thus; your Lordship says,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 34 —35.</note> It is not necessary that the Body, to be
raised at the last day, should consist of <hi>the
same Particles of Matter, which were united
at the point of death; for there must be a
great alteration in them in a lingring Disease,
as if a fat Man falls into a Consumption:
You do not say the same Particles which the
Sinner had at the very time of Commission of
his Sins; for then a long Sinner must have a
vast Body, considering the continual spending
of Particles by Perspiration.</hi> And again, here
your Lordship says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 44.</note> 
               <hi>You allow the Notion
of Personal Identity to belong to the same Man
under several changes of Matter.</hi> From which
words it is evident, That your Lordship
supposes a Person in this World may be
continued and preserved the same in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
not consisting of the same individual
Particles of Matter; and hence it demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively
follows, That let your Lordship's
<hi>Notion of Personal Identity</hi> be what it will,
it makes <hi>the same Body not to be necessary to
the same Person;</hi> and therefore it is by
your Lordship's Rule <hi>inconsistent with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Resurrection.</hi> When your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
shall think fit to clear your own <hi>Notion
of Personal Identity</hi> from this <hi>inconsistency</hi>
with the Article of the Resurrection, I do
not doubt but my <hi>Idea of Personal Identity,</hi>
will be thereby cleared too. Till then, all
<hi>inconsistency</hi> with that Article which your
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65912:120"/>
Lordship has here charged on mine, will
unavoidably fall upon your Lordship's
too.</p>
            <p>But for the clearing of both, give me
leave to say, my Lord, That whatsoever is
<hi>not necessary,</hi> does not thereby become <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent.</hi>
It is <hi>not necessary</hi> to the same <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
that his Body should always consist of
the same numerical Particles; this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
because the Particles of the
Bodies of the same Persons in this life
change every moment, and your Lordship
cannot deny it; and yet this makes it not
<hi>inconsistent</hi> with God's preserving, if he
thinks fit, to the same Persons, Bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of the same numerical Particles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
from the Resurrection to Eternity.
And so likewise though I say any thing that
supposes it <hi>not necessary,</hi> that the same nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
Particles, which were vitally unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Soul in this life, should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
to it at the Resurrection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
the Body it shall then have; yet it
is not <hi>inconsistent</hi> with this, That God may,
if he pleases, give to every one a Body
consisting only of such Particles as were
before vitally united to his Soul. And thus
I think, I have cleared my Book from all
that <hi>inconsistency</hi> which your Lordship
charges on it, and would perswade the
World it has with the <hi>Article of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only before I leave it, I will set down
the remainder of what your Lordship says
upon this Head, that though I see not the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65912:120"/>
coherence nor tendency of it, nor the force
of any Argument in it against me; yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
may be omitted that your Lordship
has thought fit to entertain your Reader
with on this new Point, nor any one have
Reason to suspect, that I have passed by any
word of your Lordship's (on this now first
introduced Subject) wherein he might find
your Lordship had proved what you had
promised in your Title-page. Your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
Words are these;<note n="†" place="margin">p. 44.</note> 
               <hi>The Dispute is
not how far Personal Identity in it self may
consist in the very same material Substance;
for we allow the Notion of Personal Identity to
belong to the same Man under several changes
of Matter; but whether it doth not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a vital Vnion between the Soul and Body
and the Life which is consequent upon it; and
therefore in the Resurrection, the same mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Substance must be re-united, or else it
cannot be called a Resurrection, but a</hi> Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<hi>i. e. it may be a new Life, but not a
raising the Body from the dead.</hi> I confess, I
do not see how what is here ushered in by
the words <hi>and therefore,</hi> is a consequence
from the preceding words; but as to the
propriety of the Name, I think it will not
be much questioned, that if the same Man
rise who was dead, it may very properly
be called the <hi>Resurrection of the dead;</hi> which
is the Language of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>I must not part with this Article of the
Resurrection, without returning my thanks
to your Lordship for making me<note n="*" place="margin">p. 62.</note> take
notice of a Fault in my <hi>Essay.</hi> When I
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65912:121"/>
write that Book, I took it for granted, as I
doubt not but many others have done, that
the Scripture had mention'd in express
terms, <hi>the Resurrection of the Body.</hi> But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Occasion your Lordship has given me
in your last Letter to look a little more
narrowly into what Revelation has declar'd
concerning the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and finding no
such express words in the Scripture, as that
<hi>the Body shall rise</hi> or <hi>be raised,</hi> or the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Body.</hi> I shall in the next Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it change these words of my Book,
<note n="†" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 18. § 7.</note> 
               <hi>The dead Bodies of Men shall rise.</hi> into these
of the Scripture, <hi>The dead shall rise.</hi> Not
that I question, that the dead shall be rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Bodies: But in Matters of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
I think it not only safest, but our
Duty, as far as any one delivers it for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
to keep close to the words of the
Scripture; unless he will assume to himself
the Authority of one inspired, or make
himself wiser than the holy Spirit himself.
If I had spoke of the Resurrection in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
Scripture terms, I had avoided giving
your Lordship the occasion of making here
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 63.</note> such a verbal Reflection on my Words;
<hi>What not if there be an Idea of Identity as to
the Body?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to your Lordship's second
Head of Accusation; your Lordship says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 44.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The next Articles of Faith which my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Ideas is inconsistent with, are no less
than those of the Trinity and the Incarnation
of our Saviour.</hi> But all the proof of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
your Lordship here brings, being
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65912:121"/>
drawn from my Notions of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
whereof so much has been said already,
the swelling my Answer into too great a
Volume, will excuse me from setting down
at large all that you have said hereupon,
so particularly, as I have done in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Article of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> which is
wholly new.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's way of proving,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 45, 46.</note> That
<hi>my Ideas of Nature and Person cannot consist,</hi>
with the Articles of the Trinity and Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
is, as far as I can understand it, this,
That, I say, we have no simple Ideas, but
by Sensation and Reflection. <hi>But, says your
Lordship,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 45.</note> 
               <hi>we cannot have any simple Ideas
of Nature and Person, by Sensation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,</hi>
Ergo, <hi>we can come to no Certainty about
the distinction of Nature and Person in my way
of Ideas. Answ.</hi> If your Lordship had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from thence, That therefore in my
way of Ideas, we can have no Ideas at all
of <hi>Nature and Person,</hi> it would have had
some appearance of a Consequence: But as
it is, it seems to me such an Argument as
this; No simple Colours in Sir <hi>Godfry Knel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>'s
way of Painting come into his exact
and lively Pictures but by his Pencil, but
no simple Colours of a Ship and a Man come
into his Pictures by his Pencil, <hi>Ergo, we
can come to no Certainty about the distinction of</hi>
a Ship and a Man in Sir <hi>Godfry Kneller</hi>'s
way of Painting.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 45.</note> 
               <hi>It is not possible for
us to have any simple Ideas of Nature and
Person by Sensation and Reflection,</hi> and I say
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65912:122"/>
so too; as impossible as it is to have a
true Picture of a Rainbow in one simple
Colour, which consists in the arangement
of many Colours. The Ideas signified by
the sounds <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> are each of
them complex Ideas; and therefore it is
as impossible to have a <hi>simple Idea</hi> of either
of them, as to have a multitude in one,
or a Composition in a Simple. But if your
Lordship means, that by Sensation and
Reflection we cannot have the simple Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
of which the complex ones of <hi>Nature</hi>
and <hi>Person</hi> are compounded; that I must
crave leave to dissent from, till your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
can produce a definition (in intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Words) of either of <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Person,</hi>
in which all that is contained cannot ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately
be resolved into simple Ideas of
Sensation and Reflection.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's definition of <hi>Person,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Vindic. p. 261.</note> is,
<hi>That it is a compleat intelligent Substance with
a peculiar manner of Subsistence.</hi> And my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of <hi>Person,</hi> which your Lordship<note n="†" place="margin">p. 59.</note>
quotes out of my <hi>Essay,</hi> is, That <q>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
stands for a thinking intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that has Reason and Reflection, and
can consider it self as it self, the same
thinking thing in different times and
places.</q> When your Lordship shall shew
any <hi>repugnancy</hi> in this my Idea (which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
by the sound <hi>Person</hi>) to the <hi>Incarnation
of our Saviour,</hi> with which your Lordship's
<hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Person</hi> may not be equally charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
I shall give your Lordship an answer
to it. This I say in answer to these Words,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65912:122"/>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 46.</note> 
               <hi>Which is repugnant to the Article of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
of our Saviour:</hi> For the preceding
reasoning to which they refer, I must own
I do not understand.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Person</hi> naturally signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that you allow; your Lordship, in
your definition of it, makes it stand for a
General <hi>abstract Idea. Person</hi> then in your
Lordship, is liable to the same default which
you lay on it in me,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 52.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That it is <hi>no more
than a Notion in the Mind.</hi> The same will be
so of the word <hi>Nature,</hi> whenever your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
pleases to define it; without which you
can have no Notion of it. And then <hi>the
Consequence</hi> which you there<note n="*" place="margin">ibid.</note> draw from
their being <hi>no more than Notions of the Mind,
will hold</hi> as much in respect of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Notion of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Person</hi> as of
mine, <hi>viz. That one Nature and three Persons
can be no more.</hi> This I crave leave to say in
answer to all that your Lordship has been
pleased to urge from Page 46 to these Words
of your Lordship's, p. 52.</p>
            <p>General terms (as <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Person</hi> are
in their ordinary use in our Language) are
the signs of general Ideas, and general
Ideas exist only in the Mind; but particular
Things (which are the Foundations of these
general Ideas, if they are abstracted as they
should be) do, or may exist conformable to
those general Ideas, and so fall under those
general Names; as he that writes this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is a <hi>Person</hi> to him, <hi>i. e.</hi> may be denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
a <hi>Person</hi> by him to whose abstract Idea
of <hi>Person</hi> he bears a conformity; just as what
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65912:123"/>
I here write, is to him a <hi>Book</hi> or a <hi>Letter,</hi>
to whose abstract Idea of a <hi>Book</hi> or a <hi>Letter</hi>
it agrees. This is what I have said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Matter all along, and what, I
humbly conceive, will serve for an answer
to those Words of your Lordship, where
you say,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 54.</note> 
               <hi>You affirm that those who make Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Person to be only abstract and complex
Ideas, can neither defend nor reasonably believe
the Doctrin of the Trinity,</hi> and to all that you
say, p. 52 —58. Only give me leave to
wish, that what your Lordship, out of a
mistake of what I say concerning the Ideas of
<hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> has urged, as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
against them, do not furnish your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
in that dispute, with such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against you as your Lordship will not
easily answer.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship<note n="*" place="margin">p. 58.</note> sets down these Words
of mine, <q>Person in it self signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
but as soon as the common use of
any Language has appropriated it to any
Idea, then that is the true Idea of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</q>
which Words your Lordship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets
thus: i. e. <hi>Men may call a Person
what they please, for there is nothing but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
use required to it: They may call a Horse or a
Tree, or a Stone, a Person if they think fit.
Answ.</hi> Men, before common use had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
this name to that complex Idea
which they now signifie by the sound <hi>Person,</hi>
might have denoted it by the sound <hi>Stone,</hi>
and <hi>Vice versa:</hi> But can your Lordship
thence argue, as you do here, Men are at the
same liberty in a Country where those words
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65912:123"/>
are already in common use? There he that
will speak properly, and so as to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
must appropriate each sound used in
that Language to an Idea in his mind (which
to himself is defining the Word) which is
in some degree conformable to the Idea that
others apply it to.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship in the next Paragraph<note n="†" place="margin">p. 59.</note>
sets down my definition of the word <hi>Person,</hi>
viz. <q>That Person stands for a thinking
intelligent Being that hath Reason and
Reflection, and can consider it self as it
self, the same thinking Being in different
times and places;</q> and then asks many
Questions upon it. I shall set down your
Lordship's definition of <hi>Person;</hi> which is
this,<note n="*" place="margin">Vindic. p. 261.</note> 
               <hi>A Person is a compleat intelligent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
with a peculiar manner of Subsistence,</hi> and
then crave leave to ask your Lordship the
same Questions concerning it, which your
Lordship here asks me<note n="†" place="margin">p. 59.</note> concerning mine;
<hi>How comes Person to stand for this and nothing
else? From whence comes</hi> compleat Substance,
or peculiar manner of Subsistence <hi>to make
up</hi> the <hi>Idea of a Person? Whether it be true or
false, I am not now to enquire; but how it comes
into this Idea of a Person? Has common use of
our Language appropriated it to this Sense? If
not, this seems to be a meer Arbitrary Idea;
and may as well be denied as affirmed. And
what a fine pass are we come to,</hi> in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
way, <hi>if a meer Arbitrary Idea must be
taken into the only true Method of Certainty?
—But if this be the true Idea of a Person,
then there can be no Vnion of two Natures in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65912:124"/>
one Person. For if a</hi> compleat intelligent
Substance <hi>be the Idea of a Person; and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and humane Natures be compleat intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Substances, then the Doctrin of the Vnion
of two Natures and one Person is quite sunk;
for here must be two Persons in this way</hi> of
your Lordship's. <hi>Again, if this be the Idea
of a Person, then where there are three Persons
there must be three distinct</hi> compleat intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Substances; <hi>and so there cannot be three
Persons in the same individual Essence. And
thus both these Doctrins of the Trinity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
are past recovery gon, if this way</hi>
of your Lordship's <hi>hold.</hi> These, my Lord,
are your Lordship's very Words; what
force there is in them I will not enquire, but
I must beseech your Lordship to take them
as Objections I make against your Notion of
<hi>Person,</hi> to shew the danger of it, and the
inconsistency it has with the Doctrin of the
<hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Incarnation of our Saviour;</hi> and
when your Lordship has removed the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
that are in them, against your own
definition of <hi>Person,</hi> mine also by the very
same Answers will be cleared.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's Argument in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Words<note n="*" place="margin">p. 61 —65.</note> to page 65. seems to me (as
far as I can collect) to lie thus: Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
tells me,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 61.</note> that I say, <q>That in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
whose Certainty is built on clear
and perfect Ideas and evident deductions
of Reason, there no Proposition can be
received for divine Revelation which
contradicts them.</q> This Proposition not
serving your Lordship's turn so well, for
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65912:124"/>
the conclusion you designed to draw from
it, your Lordship is pleased to enlarge it.
For you ask,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 62.</note> 
               <hi>But suppose I have Ideas suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for Certainty, what is to be done then?</hi>
From which Words and your following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
if I can understand it, it seems to me,
that your Lordship supposes it reasonable
for me to hold, That where-ever we are
any how certain of any Propositions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Certainty be built on clear and
perfect Ideas or no, there no Proposition
can be received for divine Revelation, which
contradicts them. And thence your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
concludes,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 64.</note> That because I say we may
make some Propositions, of whose Truth
we may be certain concerning things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have not Ideas in all their parts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
clear and distinct; therefore <hi>my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Certainty by Ideas must overthrow the
credibility of a Matter of Faith in all such
Propositions, which are offered to be believed on
the account of divine Revelation.</hi> A Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which I am so unfortunate as not to
find how it follows from your Lordship's
Premisses, because I cannot any way bring
them into Mode and Figure with such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
But this being no strange thing
to me in my want of skill in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
way of writing, I in the mean time
crave leave to ask, Whether there be any
Propositons your Lordship can be certain
of, that are not divinely revealed? And here
I will presume that your Lordship is not
so Sceptical, but that you can allow Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
attainable in many things by your
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65912:125"/>
natural Faculties. Give me leave then to
ask your Lordship, Whether, where there
be Propositions of whose Truth you have
certain Knowledge, you can receive any
Proposition for divine Revelation which
contradicts that Certainty? Whether that
Certainty be built upon the Agreement of
Ideas, such as we have, or on whatever
else your Lordship builds it? If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
as I presume your Lordship will say
you cannot, I make bold to return you
your Lordship's Questions here to me, in
your own Words;<note place="margin">p. 64.</note> 
               <hi>Let us now suppose that
you are to judge of a Proposition delivered as a
Matter of Faith, where you have a Certainty
by Reason from your Grounds such as they are?
Can you, my Lord, assent to this as a Matter
of Faith, when you are already certain of the
contrary</hi> by your way? <hi>How is this possible?
Can you believe that to be true, which you are
certain is not true? Suppose it be, That there
are two Natures in one Person, the Question
is, Whether you can assent to this as a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Faith? hf you</hi> should <hi>say,</hi> where <hi>there
are only Probabilities on the other side, I grant
that you then</hi> allow <hi>Revelation is to prevail.</hi>
But when you say you have <hi>Certainty by Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
or without Ideas <hi>to the contrary, I do not
see how it is possible for you to assent to a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Faith as true, when you are certain
from your</hi> method <hi>that it is not true. For how
can you believe against Certainty—because
the Mind is actually determined by Certainty.
And so</hi> your Lordship's <hi>Notion of Certainty
by Ideas,</hi> or without Ideas, be it what it
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65912:125"/>
will, <hi>must overthrow the credibility of a matter
of Faith in all such Propositions, which are offered
to be believed on the account of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
This Argumentation and Conclusion
is good against your Lordship, if it be good
against me. For Certainty is Certainty,
and he that is certain is certain, and cannot
assent to that <hi>as true, which he is certain is
not true,</hi> whether he supposes Certainty to
consist in the preception of the agreement
or disagreement of Ideas, such as a Man has,
or in any thing else. For whether those
who have attained Certainty, not by <hi>the
way of Ideas,</hi> can <hi>believe against Certainty</hi>
any more than those who have attained
<hi>Certainty by Ideas,</hi> we shall then see, when
your Lordship shall be pleased to shew the
World your way to Certainty without
Ideas.</p>
            <p>Indeed if what your Lordship insinuates
in the beginning of this Passage, which we
are now upon be true, your Lordship is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
(in your way without <hi>Ideas,</hi> i. e. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
immediate objects of the Mind in Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if there be any such way) as to the
understanding divine Revelation right,
than those who make use of Ideas: But
yet you are still as far as they, from <hi>assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that as true, which you are certain is not
true.</hi> Your Lordship's Words are:<note n="*" place="margin">p. 60.</note> 
               <hi>So
great a difference is there between forming
Ideas first, and then judging of Revelation by
them, and the believing of Revelation on its
proper Grounds, and the interpreting the Sense
of it by the due measures of Reason.</hi> If it be
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65912:126"/>
the priviledge of those alone who renounce
Ideas, <hi>i. e.</hi> the immediate objects of the
Mind in Thinking, to <hi>believe Revelation on
its proper Grounds, and the interpreting the
Sense of it, by the due measures of Reason;</hi>
I shall not think it strange, that any one
who undertakes to <hi>interpret the Sense of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi>
should renounce Ideas, <hi>i. e.</hi> That
he who would think right of the meaning
of any Text of Scripture should renounce,
and lay by all immediate objects of the Mind
in Thinking.</p>
            <p>But perhaps your Lordship does not here
extend this difference of <hi>believing Revelation
on its proper Grounds,</hi> and not on its proper
Grounds to all those, who are not, and all
those who are for <hi>Ideas.</hi> But your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
makes this comparison here, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
your Lordship and me, who you
think am guilty of <hi>forming Ideas first, and
then judging of Revelation by them. Answ.</hi> If
so, then this lays the blame not on my
Doctrin of Ideas, but on my particular ill
use of them. That then which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
would insinuate of me here, as a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
way to mistaking the Sense of the
Scripture, is, That <hi>I form Ideas first, and
then judge of Revelation by them,</hi> i. e. In plain
English, that I get to my self, the best I
can, the signification of the Words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Revelation is delivered; and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to understand the Sense of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
delivered in them. And pray, my
Lord, does your Lordship do otherwise?
Does the <hi>believing of Revelation upon its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65912:126"/>
Grounds, and the due measures of Reason,</hi>
teach you to judge of <hi>Revelation,</hi> before
you understand the Words it is deliver'd
in? <hi>i. e.</hi> before you have <hi>formed the Ideas</hi>
in your Mind, as well as you can, which
those Words stand for? If the <hi>due measures
of Reason</hi> teach your Lordship this, I beg
the favour of your Lordship to tell me those
<hi>due measures of Reason,</hi> that I may leave those
<hi>undue measures of Reason,</hi> which I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
followed in the interpreting the
Sense of the Scripture, whose Sense it seems
I should have interpreted first, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the signification of the Words after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I read the Revelation of the
Holy Scripture with a full assurance, that
all it delivers is true: And though this be
a submission to the Writings of those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Authors, which I neither have, nor
can have, for those of any other Men: Yet
I use (and know not how to help it, till
your Lordship shew me a better method in
those <hi>due measures of Reason,</hi> which you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
the same way to interpret to my self
the <hi>Sense</hi> of that Book, that I do of any
other. First I endeavour to understand the
Words and Phrases of the Language I read
it in, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>form Ideas</hi> they stand for. If
your Lordship means any thing else by <hi>form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ideas first,</hi> I confess, I understand it not.
And if there be any Word or Expression,
which in that Author, or in that place of
that Author, seems to have a peculiar mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>i. e.</hi> to stand for an Idea, which is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65912:127"/>
from that, which the common use
of that Language has made it a Sign of, that
Idea also, I endeavour to form in my Mind,
by comparing this Author with himself,
and observing the design of his Discourse,
that so, as far as I can, by a sincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
I may have the same Ideas, in every
place when I read the Words, which the
Author had when he writ them. But here,
my Lord, I take care not to take those for
Words of Divine Revelation, which are not
the Words of Inspired Writers: Nor think
my self concerned with that Submission to
receive the Expressions of Fallible Men, and
to Labour to find out their Meaning, or
as your Lordship Phrases it, <hi>interpret their
Sense,</hi> as if they were the Expressions of
the Spirit of God, by the Mouths or Pens
of Men Inspired and Guided by that infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Spirit. This, my Lord, is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
I use in <hi>interpreting the Sense</hi> of the
Revelation of the Scriptures; if your
Lordship knows that I do otherwise, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
you to convince me of it: And if your
Lordship does otherwise, I desire you to
shew me wherein your method differs from
mine, that I may reform upon so good a
Pattern: For as for what you accuse me of,
in the following Words, it is that, which
either has no Fault in it, or if it have, your
Lordship, I humbly conceive, is as guilty
as I. Your Words<note n="†" place="margin">p. 60.</note> are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I may pretend what I please, That I hold the
assurance of Faith, and the Certainty by Ideas,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65912:127"/>
to go upon very different Grounds; but when a
Proposition is offered me out of Scripture to be
believed, and I doubt about the Sense of it, is
not Recourse to be made to my Ideas?</hi> Give
me leave my Lord, with all submission, to
return your Lordship the same Words.
Your Lordship <hi>may pretend what you please,
that you hold the assurance of Faith, and the
Certainty</hi> of Knowledge to stand <hi>upon diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Grounds</hi> (for I presume your Lordship
will not say, that Believing and Knowing
stand upon the same Grounds, for that
would I think be to say, That probability
and demonstration are the same thing) <hi>But
when a Proposition is offered you out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to be believed, and you doubt about the
Sense of it, is not recourse to be made to your
Notions?</hi> What, my Lord, is the difference
here between your Lordship's and my way
in the Case? I must have <hi>recourse to my Ideas,</hi>
and your Lordship must have <hi>recourse to your</hi>
Notions. For I think you cannot believe
a Proposition contrary to your own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
for then you would have the
same and different Notions, at the same
time. So that all the difference between
your Lordship and me, is, That we do
both the same thing, only your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
shews a great dislike to my using the
term <hi>Idea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the instance your Lordship here gives,
is beyond my comprehension. Your
say,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 60.</note> 
               <hi>a Proposition is offered me <hi>out of Scripture</hi> to be believed, and I doubt about the
Sense of it—As in the present Case, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65912:128"/>
there can be three Persons in one Nature,
or two Natures and one Person.</hi> My Lord,
my Bible is faulty again, for I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that I ever read in it either of
these Propositions, in these precise Words,
<hi>There are three Persons in one Nature,</hi> or,
<hi>There are two Natures and one Person.</hi> When
your Lordship shall shew me a Bible where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are so set down, I shall then think
them a good instance of <hi>Propositions offered
me out of Scripture,</hi> till then, whoever shall
say, that they are Propositions in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when there are no such Words so put
together, to be found in Holy Writ, seems
to me to make a new Scripture in Words
and Propositions, that the Holy Ghost
dictated not. I do not here question their
Truth, nor deny that they may be drawn
from the Scripture: But I deny, that these
very Propositions are in express Words
in my Bible. For that is the only thing
I deny here, if your Lordship can shew them
me in yours, I beg you to do it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, taking them to be as
true as if they were the very Words of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation; the Question then is, how
must we <hi>interpret the Sense of them?</hi> For
supposing them to be Divine Revelation,
to ask as your Lordship here does, <hi>what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi>
I, or any one <hi>can come to</hi> about
their possibility, seems to me to involve a
Contradiction in it. For, whoever admits
a Proposition to be of Divine Revelation,
supposes it not only to be possible, but
true. Your Lordship's Question then can
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65912:128"/>
mean only this; What Sense can I <hi>upon my
Principles,</hi> come to of either of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
<hi>but in the way of Ideas?</hi> And I
crave leave to ask your Lordship, what
Sense of them can your Lordship <hi>upon your
Principles come to, but in the way of</hi> Notions?
Which in plain English, amounts to no
more than this, That your Lordship must
understand them according to the Sense you
have of those Terms they are made up of;
and I according to the Sense I have of those
Terms. Nor can it be otherwise, unless
your Lorship can take a Term in any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to have one Sense, and yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it in another: And thus we see, that
in effect, Men have differently understood
and interpreted the Sense of these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Whether they used <hi>the way of Ideas</hi>
or not, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether they called what any
Word stood for <hi>Notion,</hi> or <hi>Sense,</hi> or <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or <hi>Idea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think my self obliged to return your
Lordship my Thanks, for the News you
write me here,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 61.</note> of one who has
found <hi>a secret way how the same Body may
be in distant Places at once.</hi> It making no
part, that I can see, of the Reasoning your
Lordship was then upon, I can take it only
for a piece of News: And the Favour was
the greater, that your Lordship was pleased
to stop your self in the midst of so serious
an Argument as the <hi>Articles of</hi> the <hi>Trinity
and Incarnation,</hi> to tell it me. And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
'tis pity, that that Author had not
used some of the Words of my Book, which
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65912:129"/>
might have served to have tied him and me
together. For his <hi>Secret</hi> about a Body in
two Places at once, which he <hi>does keep up;</hi>
and <hi>my Secret about Certainty, which your
Lordship thinks had been better kept up too,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all your Words, bring me into his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
but very untowardly. If your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
would be pleased to shew, That <hi>my
Secret about Certainty</hi> (as you think fit to
call it) is false or erroneous, the World
would see a good Reason, why you should
<hi>think it better kept up;</hi> till then perhaps they
may be apt to suspect, that the Fault is not
so much in my published <hi>Secret</hi> about Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
as somewhere else. But since your
Lordship <hi>thinks it had been better kept up;</hi> I
promise that as soon as you shall do me the
Favour to make publick a better Notion <hi>of
Certainty</hi> than mine, I will by a publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation
call in mine: Which I hope your
Lordship will do, for I dare say, no Body
will think it <hi>good</hi> or <hi>Friendly Advice</hi> to your
Lordship, if you have such a <hi>Secret,</hi> that
you should <hi>keep it up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship with some Emphasis,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 63.</note>
bids me <hi>observe my own Words, that I here po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
say,</hi> 
               <q>That the Mind not being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Truth of that it doth not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
know:</q> 
               <hi>So that it is plain here, that
I place Certainty only in evident Knowledge,
or in clear and distinct Ideas; and yet my great
Complaint of your Lordship, was, That you
charged this upon me, and now your Lordship
finds it in my own Words. Answ.</hi> My <hi>own
Words</hi> in that place, are, <hi>The Mind in not
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65912:129"/>
certain of what it doth not evidently know;</hi> but
in them or that Passage as set down by your
Lordship, there is not the least mention of
<hi>clear and distinct Ideas,</hi> and therefore I should
wonder to hear your Lordship so solemnly
call them <hi>my own Words,</hi> when they are
but what your Lordship would have to be
a Consequence of my Words, were it not,
as I humbly conceive, a way not unfrequent
with your Lordship to speak of that, which
you think a Consequence from any thing
said, as if it were the very thing said. It
rests therefore upon your Lordship to prove
that <hi>evident Knowledge</hi> can be only where the
Ideas concerning which it is, are perfectly
clear and distinct. I am certain, that I have
evident Knowledge, that the <hi>Substance</hi> of
my Body and Soul exists, though I am as
certain that I have but a very obscure and
confused Idea of any <hi>Substance</hi> at all: So
that my Complaint of your Lordship upon
that Account, remains very well Founded,
notwithstanding any thing you alledge
here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordship</hi> summing up the force of what
you have said <hi>add</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 65.</note> That you have pleaded (1.)
That my method of Certainty shakes the belief
of Revelation in General (2.) That is shakes the
belief of particular Propositions or Articles of
Faith, which depend upon the Sense of Words
contained in Scripture.</p>
            <p>That your Lordship has <hi>pleaded,</hi> I grant,
but with Submission I deny, that you have
proved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:65912:130"/>
(1.) That my definition of Knowledge,
which is that which your Lordship calls my
<hi>method of Certainty, shakes the belief of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in general.</hi> For all that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
offers for Proof of it, is only the alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some other Passages out of my Book
quite different from that my definition of
Knowledge, which you endeavour to shew
do shake the belief of Revelation in General.
But Indeed have not, nor, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
cannot shew, that they do any ways
<hi>shake the belief of Revelation in general.</hi> But
if they did, it does not at all follow from
thence, that my definition of Knowledge,
<hi>i. e. my method of Certainty</hi> at all <hi>shakes the
belief of Revelation in general,</hi> which was what
your Lordship undertook to prove.</p>
            <p>(2.) As to the <hi>shaking the belief of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Propositions or Articles of Faith, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,</hi>
as you here say,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 65.</note> 
               <hi>upon the Sense of
Words;</hi> I think I have sufficiently cleared
my self from that Charge, as will yet be
more evident from what your Lordship here
farther urges.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship says, my placing <hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
in the perception of the agreement or
disagreement of Ideas, <hi>shakes the Foundations</hi>
of the Articles of Faith [above mentioned]
<hi>which depend upon the Sense of Words contained
in the Scripture:</hi> And the Reason your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
gives for it, is this; Because <hi>I do not say
we are to believe all that we find there expressed.</hi>
My Lord, upon reading these Words, I
consulted the <hi>Errata,</hi> to see whether the
Printer had injured you: For I could not
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:65912:130"/>
easily believe that your Lordship should Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
after a Fashon, that would justifie such a
conclusion as this, <hi>viz.</hi> Your Lordship in
your Letter to me, <hi>does not say that we are to
believe all that we find expressed in Scripture?</hi>
therefore your Notion of Certainty shakes
the belief of this Article of Faith, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ descended into Hell. This I
think will scarce hold for a good Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
till the <hi>not saying</hi> any Truth, be the
denying of it, and then if my <hi>not saying</hi> in
my Book, <hi>That we are to believe all there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,</hi>
be to deny, <hi>That we are to believe all
that we find there expressed;</hi> I fear many of
your Lordship's Books will be found to
<hi>shake the belief</hi> of several or all the <hi>Articles
of our Faith.</hi> But supposing this Consequence
to be good, <hi>viz. I do not say</hi> therefore I
deny, and thereby <hi>I shake the belief of some
Articles of Faith;</hi> how does this prove, That
my placing of Certainty in the perception
of the agreement or disagreement of Ideas,
shakes any Article of Faith, unless my say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that Certainty consists in the perception
of the agreement or disagreement of Ideas,
in the 301 page of my Essay, be a Proof,
that <hi>I do not say</hi> in any other part of that
Book, <hi>That we are to believe all that we find
expressed in Scripture</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps the remaining Words of the
period will help us out in your Lordship's
Argument, which all together stands thus,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 65.</note>
               <hi>Because I do not say we are to believe all that
we find there expressed; but</hi> [I do say] <hi>in case
we have any clear and distinct Ideas, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65912:131"/>
the Sense another way, than the Words seem
to carry it, we are to judge that to be the true
Sense.</hi> My Lord, I do not remember where
I say, what in the latter part of this Period
your Lordship makes me say: And your
Lordship would have done me a Favour to
have quoted the place. Indeed I do say
in the Chapter your Lordship seems to be
upon, <q>That no Proposition can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
for divine Revelation, or obtain
the assent due to all such, if it be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to our clear intuitive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</q>This is what I there say, and
all that I there say: Which in effect is this,
That no Proposition can be received for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation, which is contradictory to
a self-evident Proposition, and if that be
it, which your Lordship makes me say here
in the foregoing Words, I agree to it,
and would be glad to know whether your
Lordship differs in Opinion from me in
it. But this not answering your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
your Lordship would in the following
Words of this Paragraph,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 65.</note> change self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident
Proposition into a Proposition we
<hi>have attained Certainty of,</hi> though <hi>by imperfect
Ideas:</hi> In which Sense the Proposition your
Lordship argues from as mine, will stand
thus, That no Proposition can be received
for <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> or obtain the assent
due to all such, if it be contradictory to any
Proposition, of whose Truth we are by
any way certain. And then I desire your
Lordship to name the Two contradictory
Propositions, the one of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:65912:131"/>
I do not <hi>assent</hi> to; the other, That <hi>I have
attained to a Certainty of by my imperfect Ideas,</hi>
which makes me reject or not assent to that
of Divine Revelation. The very setting
down of these Two contradictory Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
will be demonstration against me,
and if your Lordship cannot (as I humbly
conceive you cannot) name any Two such
Propositions, 'tis an evidence, that all this
Dust, that is raised, is only a great deal
of Talk about what your Lordship cannot
prove. For that your Lordship has not
yet proved any such thing, I am humbly
of Opinion, I have already shewn.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's Discourse of <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
in the following Pages,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 66-69.</note> is, I think, as
far as I am concerned in it, to shew, that
Certainty cannot be had by Ideas: Because
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> using the term <hi>Idea</hi> missed of it.
<hi>Answ.</hi> The Question between your Lordship
and me not being about <hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s but
my Notion of <hi>Certainty,</hi> your Lordship will
put an end to my Notion of <hi>Certainty by
Ideas,</hi> whenever your Lordship shall prove,
That <hi>Certainty</hi> cannot be attained any way
by the immediate Objects of the Mind in
Thinking, <hi>i. e. by Ideas;</hi> or that <hi>Certainty</hi>
does not consist in the perception of the
agreement or disagreement of Ideas; or last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when your Lordship shall shew us, what
else <hi>Certainty</hi> does consist in. When your
Lordship shall do either of these Three, I
promise your Lordship to renounce my
<hi>notion,</hi> or <hi>way,</hi> or <hi>method,</hi> or <hi>grounds</hi> (or
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65912:132"/>
whatever else your Lordship has been pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to call it) <hi>of Certainty by Ideas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Paragraph<note n="†" place="margin">p. 69-70.</note> is to shew the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
your Lordship has <hi>to favour me</hi>
in the Words <hi>it may be.</hi> I shall be always
sorry to have mistaken any ones, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
your Lordship's <hi>Inclination to favour me:</hi>
But since the Press has published this to
the World, the World must now be Judge
of your Lordship's <hi>Inclination to favour
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The three or four following Pages<note n="*" place="margin">p. 70-74.</note> are
to shew, That your Lordship's exception
against Ideas was not against the term <hi>Ideas,</hi>
and that I mistook you in it. <hi>Answ.</hi> My
Lord, I must own that there are very few
Pages of your Letters, when I come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
what is the precise meaning of your
Words, either as making distinct Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or a continued Discourse, wherein I
do not think my self in danger to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken;
but whether in the present Case,
one much more learned than I, would not
have understood your Lordship as I did,
must be left to those who will be at the pains
to consider your Words<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 133.</note> and my Reply
to them. Your Lordship saying, <hi>As I have
stated my Notion of Ideas, it may be of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
consequence;</hi> seemed to me to say no
more, but that my Book in general <hi>might
be of dangerous consequence.</hi> This seeming
too general an Accusation, I endeavoured to
find what it was more particularly in it,
which your Lordship <hi>thought might be of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
consequence:</hi> And the first thing I
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65912:132"/>
thought you excepted against, was the use
of the term <hi>Idea.</hi> But your Lordship tells
me here,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 72.</note> I was mistaken, it was not the
<hi>term Idea</hi> you excepted against, <hi>but the way
of Certainty by Ideas.</hi> To excuse my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
I have this to say for my self, That
reading in your first Letter<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 23.</note> these express
Words; <hi>When new Terms are made use of
by ill Men to promote Scepticism and Insidelity,
and to overthrow the Mysteries of our Faith, we
have then Reason to enquire into <hi>them,</hi> and to
examine the Foundation and Tendency of <hi>them;</hi>
               </hi>
it could not be very strange, if I understood
<hi>them</hi> to refer to <hi>Terms;</hi> but it seems I was
mistaken, and should have understood by
<hi>them <hi>my way of Certainty by Ideas,</hi>
               </hi> and should
have read your Lordship's Words thus;
<hi>When new Terms are made use of by ill Men
to promote Scepticism and Infidelity and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the Mysteries of Faith, we have then Reason
to enquire into <hi>them,</hi>
               </hi> i. e. Mr. <hi>L.</hi>'s definition
of Knowledge (for that is my way of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
by Ideas) <hi>and then to examine the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and Tendency of <hi>them,</hi> i. e.</hi> this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Knowledge or Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
consists in the Perception of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Disagreement of Ideas. <hi>Them,</hi> in
your Lordship's Words, as I thought (for
I am scarce ever sure, what your Lordship
means by <hi>them</hi>) necessarily refering to what
<hi>ill Men made use for the promoting of Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism
and Infidelity,</hi> I thought it had refered
to <hi>Terms. Why so?</hi> says your Lordship,
<hi>your Quarrel,</hi> you say, <hi>was not with the term
Ideas.</hi> But that which <hi>you insisted upon was
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65912:133"/>
the way of Certainty by Ideas, and the new
Terms as imploied to that purpose;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis that which your Lordship must be
understood to mean by what <hi>ill Men make
use of,</hi> &amp;c. Now I appeal to my Reader,
whether I may not be excused, if I took
<hi>Them</hi> rather to refer to <hi>Terms,</hi> a word in
the Plural Number preceding in the same
Period, than to <hi>way of Certainty by Ideas,</hi>
which is of the Singular Number, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
preceding, no nor so much as expressed
in the same Sentence? And if by my Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the use of the Pronoun <hi>Them,</hi> 'tis
my misfortune to be often at a loss in the
understanding of your Lordship's Writings,
I hope I shall be excused.</p>
            <p>Another excuse for my understanding,
that one of the things in my Book which
your Lordship <hi>thought might be of dangerous
consequence,</hi> was the term <hi>Idea,</hi> may be found
in these Words of your Lordship,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 92, 93.</note> 
               <hi>But
what need all this great noise about Ideas and
Certainty, true and real Certainty by Ideas:
If after all, it comes only to this, That our Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
only present to us such things from whence
we bring Arguments to prove the Truth of things?
But the World hath been strangely amuzed with
Ideas of late; and we have been told, That
strange things might be done by the help of Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
and yet these Ideas at last come to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Notions of things, which we must make
use of in our Reasoning.</hi> I shall offer one
Passage more<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 93.</note> for my excuse, out of the
same Page. I had said in my Chapter about
the Existence of God, I thought it most
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65912:133"/>
proper to express my self in the most usual
and familiar way, by common Words and
Expressions. <hi>Your Lordship wishes I had done
so quite through my Book; for then I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
given that occasion to the Enemies of our
Faith, to take up my new way of Ideas, as an
effectual Battery (as they imagin'd) against the</hi>
Mysteries of the Christian Faith. <hi>But I
might have enjoyed the Satisfaction of my Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
long enough, before your Lordship had taken
notice of them, unless you had found them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in doing Mischief.</hi> Thus this Passage
stands in your Lordship's former Letter,
though here<note n="†" place="margin">p. 72, 73.</note> your Lordship gives us but
a part off it, and that part your Lordship
breaks of into two, and gives us inverted
and in other words. Perhaps those who
observe this, and better understand the Arts
of Controversie than I do, may find some
skill in it. But your Lordship<note n="*" place="margin">p. 72.</note> breaks off
the former Passage at these Words, <hi>strange
things might be done by the help of Ideas;</hi> and
then adding these new ones, <hi>i. e. as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Certainty,</hi> leaves out those which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
your wish, That <hi>I had expressed my self
in the most usual way by common Words and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
quite through my Book,</hi> as I had done
in my Chapter of the Existence of a God;
<hi>for then,</hi> says your Lordship,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 93.</note> 
               <hi>I had not
given that occasion to the Enemies of our Faith
to take up my new way of Ideas as an effectual
Battery,</hi> &amp;c. which wish of your Lordship's
is, That I had all along left out the term
<hi>Idea,</hi> as is plain from my Words, which
you refer to in your wish, as they stand in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65912:134"/>
my first Letter,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Let. p. 127.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>I thought it
most proper to express my self in the
most usual and familiar way—by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Words, and known ways of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;
and therefore, as I think, I have
scarce used the word <hi>Idea</hi> in that whole
Chapter.</q> Now I must again appeal to
my Reader, Whether your Lordship having
so plainly wished that I had used <hi>common
Words and Expressions</hi> in opposition to the
term <hi>Idea,</hi> I am not excusable if I took you
to mean that Term? Though your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
leaves out the wish, and instead of it
puts in, <hi>i. e. as a matter of Certainty;</hi> words
which were not in your former Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
though it be for mistaking you in my
Answer to that Letter, that you here blame
me. I must own, my Lord, my dulness
will be very apt to mistake you in Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
seemingly so plain as these, till I can
presume my self quick-sighted enough to
understand Mens meaning in their Writings
not by their Expressions; which I confess I
am not, and is an Art I find my self too old
now to learn.</p>
            <p>But bare mistake is not all; your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 73.</note> accuses me also of Unfairness and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuity
in understanding these Words of
yours, <hi>The World has been strangely amuzed
with Ideas, and yet these Ideas at last come to be
only common Notions of things,</hi> as if in them
your Lordship owned <hi>Ideas to be only common
Notions of things.</hi> To this, my Lord, I
must humbly crave leave to answer, That
there was no <hi>Vnfairness</hi> or <hi>Disingenuity</hi> in my
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65912:134"/>
saying your Lordship owned Ideas for such,
because I understood you to speak in that
place in your own Sense; and thereby to
shew that the new <hi>term Idea</hi> need not be
introduced, when it signified only the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Notions of things,</hi> i. e. signified no more
than <hi>Notion</hi> doth, which is a more usual
Word. This I took to be your meaning in
that place; and whether I or any one might
not so understand it, without deserving to
be told,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 73.</note> That this is a way of <hi>turning
things upon your Lordship which you did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from me,</hi> or such a solemn appeal as
this, <hi>Iudge now how fair and ingenuous this
Answer is,</hi> I leave to any one, who will but
do me the favour to cast his Eye on the
Passage above quoted, as it stands in your
Lordship's own Words in your first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 92, 93.</note> For I humbly beg leave to say,
That I cannot but wonder to find, that
when your Lordship is charging me with
want of Fairness and Ingenuity, you should
leave out in the quoting of your own
Words, those which served most to justifie
the Sense I had taken them in, and put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the stead of them. In your first
Letter<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 93.</note> they stand thus: <hi>But the World hath
been strangely amuzed with Ideas of late, and
we have been told that strange things might be
done by the help of Ideas; and yet these Ideas
at last come to be only common Notions of
things which we must make use of in our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,</hi>
and so on to the end of what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
set down; all which I quoted<note n="*" place="margin">1 Let. p. 62.</note> to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
my self from being suspected <hi>to turn
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65912:135"/>
things upon your Lordship</hi> in a Sense which
your Words (that the Reader had before
him) would not bear: And in your second
Letter,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 73.</note> in the place now under conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
they stand thus: <hi>But the World hath
been strangely amuzed with Ideas of late, and
we have been told that strange things may be
done with Ideas,</hi> i. e. <hi>as to matter of Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and there your Lordship ends. Will
your Lordship give me leave now to use
your own Words, <hi>Iudge now how fair and
ingenuous this is:</hi> Words which I should not
use, but that I find them used by your
Lordship in this very Passage, and upon
this very Occasion.</p>
            <p>I grant my self a mortal Man very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Mistakes, especially in your Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
But that in my Mistakes, I am guilty
of any <hi>Vnfairness</hi> or <hi>Disingenuity,</hi> your
Lordship will, I humbly conceive, pardon
me, if I think it will pass for want of
<hi>Fairness</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity</hi> in any one, without
clear Evidence to accuse me: To avoid
any such Suspicion in my first Letter, I
set down every Word contained in those
Pages of your Book which I was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in; and in my second, I set down most
of the Passages of your Lordship's first An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that I replied to. But because the
doing it all along in this, would, I find,
too much increase the bulk of my Book;
I earnestly beg every one, who will think
this my Reply worth his Perusal, to lay
your Lordship's Letter before him, that he
may see whether in these Pages, I direct my
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65912:135"/>
Answer to, without setting them down at
large, there be any thing material unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or <hi>Vnfairly</hi> or <hi>Disingenuously</hi> represented.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship, in the next Words,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 73.</note> gives
a Reason why I ought to have understood
your Words, as <hi>a consequence of my Assertion,</hi>
and not <hi>as your own Sense,</hi> viz. Because <hi>you
all along distinguish the way of Reason, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
one thing from another, from my way of
Certainty in the Agreement or Disagreement of
Ideas. Answer.</hi> I know your Lordship does
<hi>all along</hi> talk of <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>my way be Ideas,</hi>
as distinct or opposite: But this is the thing
I have and do complain of, That your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
does speak of them as distinct, without
shewing wherein they are different, since
the Perception of the Agreement of Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Ideas, which is <hi>my way</hi> of <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi>
is also the way of Reason: For the
Perception of the Agreement or Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ideas, is either by an immediate
Comparison of two Ideas, as in self-evident
Propositions; which way of Knowledge of
Truth, is the way of Reason, or by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention
of intermediate Ideas, <hi>i. e. by the
Deduction of one thing from another,</hi> which is
also <hi>the way of Reason,</hi> as I have shewn<note n="*" place="margin">1 Let. p. 128.</note>;
where I answer to your speaking <hi>of Certainty
placed in good and sound Reason,</hi> and <hi>not in
Ideas;</hi> in which place, as in several others,
your Lordship opposes <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi>
which your Lordship calls here <hi>distinguishing</hi>
them: But to continue to speak frequently
of two things as different, or of two ways
as opposite, without ever shewing any Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65912:136"/>
or Opposition in them, after it has
been pressed for, is a way of Ingenuity
which your Lordship will pardon to my Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
if I have not formerly been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with; and therefore, when you
shall have shewn, that Reasoning about <hi>Ideas</hi>
or by <hi>Ideas,</hi> is not the same way of Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as that about or by <hi>Notions</hi> or <hi>Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and that what I mean by <hi>Ideas</hi> is not
the same that your Lordship means by <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
you will have some reason to blame
me for mistaking you in the Passages above
quoted.<note n="*" place="margin">p. 73.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For if your Lordship, in those Words,
does not except against the Term <hi>Ideas,</hi> but
allows it to have the same Signification with
<hi>Notions,</hi> or <hi>Conceptions,</hi> or <hi>Apprehensions;</hi>
then your Lordship's Words will run thus,
<hi>But what need all this great noise about Notions
or Conceptions, or Apprehensions?</hi> And <hi>the
World has been strangely amuzed with Notions,
or Conceptions, or Apprehensions of late;</hi> which,
whether it be that which your Lordship will
own to be your meaning, I must leave to
your Consideration.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship proceeds<note n="*" place="margin">p. 74.</note> to examine <hi>my
new method of Certainty,</hi> as you are pleased
to call it,</p>
            <p>To my asking <hi>whether there be any other, or
older Method of Certainty,</hi> Your Lordship an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 75.</note> 
               <hi>That is not the point; but whether
mine be any at all? Which your Lordship denies.
Answer.</hi> I grant, to him that barely <hi>denies</hi>
it to be <hi>any at all,</hi> it is <hi>not the point,</hi> whether
there be any <hi>older;</hi> but to him that calls it
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65912:136"/>
               <hi>a new method,</hi> I humbly conceive it will not
be thought wholly besides <hi>the point,</hi> to shew
an <hi>older,</hi> at least, that it ought to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
these following Words of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's,
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>your Lordship did never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to inform the World of new Methods;</hi> which
being in Answer to my desire, that you
would be pleased to shew me an older, or
another Method, plainly imply, That your
Lordship supposes, that whoever will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the World of another <hi>Method of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
than mine, can do it only by <hi>inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
them of <hi>a new one.</hi> But since this is the
Answer your Lordship pleases to make to
my Request, I crave leave to consider it a
little.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship having pronounced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
my Definition of Knowledge, which
you call <hi>my Method of Certainty,</hi> That <hi>it
might be of dangerous Consequence to an Article
of the Christian Faith,</hi> I desired<note n="*" place="margin">2 Let. p. 87, 88.</note> you to
<q>shew in what Certainty lies;</q> and desired
it of your Lordship by these pressing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
That it would secure that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Faith against any <hi>dangerous Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi>
from my way, and be a great Service
to Truth in general. To which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
replies here,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 75.</note> 
               <hi>That you did never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to inform the World of</hi> New <hi>Methods;
and therefore, are not bound to go any farther
than what you found fault with, which was my
new Method.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> My Lord, I did not desire any
<hi>new Method</hi> of you. I observed your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
in more places than one, reflected on
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65912:137"/>
me for <hi>writing out of my own Thoughts;</hi> and
therefore I could not expect from your
Lordship what you so much condemn in
another. Besides, one of the Faults you
found with my Method, was, That it was
<hi>New:</hi> And therefore, if your Lordship will
look again into that Passage,<note n="†" place="margin">2 Let. P. 88.</note> where I desire
you to <hi>set the World right in a thing of that great
Consequence,</hi> as it is to know wherein Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
consists; you will not find, that I
mention any thing of a <hi>new Method</hi> of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty;
my Words were <hi>another,</hi> whether
old or new was indifferent. In truth, all
that I requested, was only such a <hi>Method of
Certainty,</hi> as your Lordship approved of,
and was secure in; and therefore I do not
see how your <hi>not pretending to inform the World
in any new Methods,</hi> can be any way alledg'd
as a Reason, for refusing so useful and so
charitable a thing.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship farther adds,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 75.</note> That <hi>you are
not bound to go any farther, than what you found
fauls with. Answer.</hi> I suppose your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
means, That <hi>you are not bound by the
Law of Disputation;</hi> nor are you, as I humbly
conceive, by this Law forbid: Or if you
were, the Law of the Schools could not
dispense with the Eternal Divine Law of
Charity. The Law of Disputing, whence
had it its so mighty a Sanction? It is at best
but the Law of Wrangling, if it shut out
the great Ends of Information and Instruction;
and serves only to flatter a little
guilty Vanity, in a Victory over an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
less skilful in this Art of Fencing.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65912:137"/>
Who can believe, that upon so slight an
account, your Lordship should neglect your
Design of writing against me? The great
Motives of your Concern for an <hi>Article of
the Christian Faith,</hi> and of that <hi>Duty,</hi> which
you profess has made you do <hi>what you have
done,</hi> will be believed to work more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
in your Lordship, than to let a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Church, and a Teacher in <hi>Israel,</hi>
not tell one who asks him which is the
right and safe Way, if he knows it. No,
no, my Lord, a Character so much to the
Prejudice of your Charity, no-body will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of your Lordship, no, not from your
self: Whatever your Lordship may say,
the World will believe, That you would
have given a better <hi>Method of Certainty,</hi> if
you had had one; when thereby, you would
have secured Men from the danger of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into Errors in <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
have recalled them from <hi>my way of
Certainty,</hi> which leads, as your Lordship
says, to <hi>Scepticism</hi> and <hi>Infidelity:</hi> For to turn
Men from a way they are in, the bare tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them it is dangerous, puts but a short
stop to their going on in it: There is nothing
effectual to set them a going right, but to
shew them which is the safe and sure way;
a piece of Humanity, which when asked,
no body, as far as he knows, refuses an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
and this I have earnestly asked of
your Lordship.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship<note n="*" place="margin">p. 75.</note> 
               <hi>represents to me the Vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactoriness and Inconsistency</hi> of my way of
Certainty, by telling me, That <hi>it seems still
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65912:138"/>
a strange thing to you, that I should talk so
much of a new Method of Certainty by Ideas;
and yet allow, as I do, such a want of Ideas,
so much Imperfection in them, and such a want
of Connection between our Ideas, and the things
themselves. Answer.</hi> This Objection being
so visibly against the Extent of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and not the <hi>Certainty</hi> of it by Ideas,
would need no other Answer but this, that
it proved nothing to the point; which was
to shew, that <hi>my way by Ideas,</hi> was <hi>no way</hi>
to Certainty <hi>at all;</hi> not to <hi>True</hi> Certainty,
which is a Term your Lordship uses here<note n="†" place="margin">p. 76.</note>
which I shall be able to conceive what you
mean by, when you shall be pleased to tell
me what <hi>false Certainty</hi> is.</p>
            <p>But because what you say here, is in short
what you ground your Charge of <hi>Scepticism</hi>
on, in your former Letter, I Shall here, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my Promise, consider what your
Lordship says there, and hope you will allow
this to be no unfit place.</p>
            <p>Your Charge of <hi>Scepticism,</hi> in your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Letter,<note n="†" place="margin">I Answ. p. 125.—131.</note> is as followeth.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's first Argument consists
in these Propositions, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That <hi>I say,</hi> P. 125, That Knowledge
is the Perception of the Agreement or Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Ideas.</p>
            <p>2. That <hi>I go about to prove,</hi> That there are
very many more Beings, of which we have
no Ideas, than those of which we have;
from whence, your Lordship draws this
Conclusion, <hi>That we are excluded from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
any Knowledge, as to the far greatest part
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65912:138"/>
of the Vniverse.</hi> Which I agree to: But with
Submission, this is not the Proposition to
be proved, but this, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>my way by
Ideas,</hi> or <hi>my way of Certainty by Ideas;</hi> for
to that your Lordship reduces it, <hi>i. e.</hi> my
placing of Certainty in the Perception of
the Agreement or Disagreement of Ideas,
<hi>leads to Scepticism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther, from my saying, that the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
World is greater and more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
certainly than the material, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
argues,<note n="†" place="margin">I Answ. p. 126.</note> That if <hi>Certainty</hi> may be had
<hi>by general Reasons without particular Ideas</hi> in
one, it may also <hi>in other Cases. Answer.</hi> It
may no doubt: But this is nothing against
any thing I have said; for I have neither
said, nor suppose, That <hi>Certainty by general
Reasons,</hi> or any Reasons can be had without
<hi>Ideas;</hi> no more than I say, or suppose,
that we can reason without thinking, or
think without immediate Objects of our
Minds in thinking, <hi>i. e.</hi> think without <hi>Ideas.</hi>
But your Lordship asks, <hi>Whence comes this
Certainty</hi> (for I say certainly) <hi>where there be
no particular Ideas,</hi> if Knowledge consists in
the Perception of the Agreement or Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Ideas? I answer, we have
Ideas as far as we are certain, and beyond
that we have neither Certainty, no nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability;
every thing which we either know
or believe, is some Proposition. Now no
Proposition can be framed as the Object of
our Knowledge or Assent, wherein two
Ideas are not joined to, or separated from
one another. As for Example, when I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65912:139"/>
that <hi>something exists in the World, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I have no Idea, Existence</hi> is affirmed of
something, some Being: And I have as clear
an Idea of <hi>Existence</hi> and <hi>something,</hi> the two
things joined in that Proposition, as I have
of them in this Proposition, <hi>something exists
in the World, whereof I have an Idea.</hi> When
therefore I affirm, that the intellectual
World is greater, and more beautiful, than
the material: Whether I should know the
truth of this Proposition, either by Divine
Revelation, or should assert it as highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
(which is all I do in that Chapter,<note n="†" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 3.</note>
out of which this Instance is brought) it
means no more but this, <hi>viz.</hi> That there
are more, and more beautiful Beings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have no Ideas, than there are of
which we have Ideas; of which Beings,
whereof we have no Ideas, we can for want
of Ideas, have no farther Knowledge, but
that such Beings do exist.</p>
            <p>If your Lordship shall now ask me how I
know there are such Beings; I answer, that in
that <hi>Chapter</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 3.</note> 
               <hi>of the Extent of</hi> our Knowledge,
I do not say I know, but I endeavour to shew,
that it is most highly probable: But yet a Man
is capable of knowing it to be true, because he
is capable of having it revealed to him by God,
that this Proposition is true, <hi>viz.</hi> That in
the Works of God there are more and more
beautiful Beings, whereof we have no Ideas,
than there are whereof we have Ideas. If
God instead of shewing the very things to
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> had only revealed to him, that
this Proposition was true, <hi>viz.</hi> That there
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65912:139"/>
were things in Heaven <hi>which neither Eye had
seen, nor Ear had heard, nor had entred into
the Heart of Man to conceive,</hi> would he not
have known the Truth of that Proposition
of whose Terms he had Ideas, <hi>viz. of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
whereof he had no other Ideas, but
barely as something, and of <hi>Existence,</hi> though
in the want of other Ideas of them he could
attain no other Knowledge of them, but
barely that they existed? So that in what
I have there said, there is no Contradiction
nor Shadow of a Contradiction, to my pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Knowledge in the Perception of the
Agreement or Disagreement of Ideas.</p>
            <p>But if I should any where mistake, and say
any thing inconsistent with that way of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of mine; how I beseech your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
could you conclude from thence, that
the placing Knowledge in the Perception of
the Agreement of Disagreement of Ideas,
<hi>tends to Scepticism?</hi> That which is the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
here to be proved, would remain still
unproved: For I might say things inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with this Proposition, That <hi>Knowledge
consists in the Perception of the Connection and
Agreement, or Disagreement and Repugnancy
of our Ideas;</hi> and yet that Proposition be
true, and very far from <hi>tending to Scepticism,</hi>
unless your Lordship will argue, that every
Proposition that is inconsistent with what a
Man any where says, <hi>tends to Scepticism;</hi>
and then I should be tempted to infer, that
many Propositions in the Letters your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
has honoured me with, will <hi>tend to Scepticism.</hi>

Your Lordship's second Argument is<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 126, 127.</note>
from my saying, <q>We have no Ideas of
the mechanical Affections, of the minute
Particles of Bodies, which hinders our
certain Knowledge of universal Truths
concerning natural Bodies;</q> from
whence your Lordship concludes, <hi>That since
we can attain to no Science, as to Bodies or
Spirits, our Knowledge must be confin'd to a
very narrow compass.</hi> I grant it; but I crave
leave to mind your Lordship again, That
this is not the Proposition to be proved:
A little Knowledge is still <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and
not <hi>Scepticism.</hi> But let me have affirm'd our
Knowledge to be comparatively very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
How, I beseech your Lordship, does
that any way prove, that this Proposition,
<q>Knowledge consists in the Perception of
the Agreement or Disagreement of our Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</q>
any way <hi>tends to Scepticism?</hi> which
was the Proposition to be proved. But the
Inference your Lordship shuts up this Head
with<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. P. 127.</note> in these Words; <hi>So that all Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
is given up in the way of Knowledge, as
to the visible and invisible World, or at least the
greatest part of them;</hi> shewing in the first
part of it what your Lordship should have
inferred, and was willing to infer, does at
last by these Words in the Close, <hi>Or at least
the greatest part of <hi>them,</hi>
               </hi> I guess come
just to nothing; I say, I guess; for what
<hi>them,</hi> by Grammatical Construction is to
be referred to, seems not clear to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:65912:141"/>
Your third Argument<note n="*" place="margin">I Answ. p. 128.</note> being just of the
same kind with the former, only to shew,
That I reduce our Knowledge to a very
narrow compass, in respect of the whole
extent of <hi>Beings</hi> is already answered.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, your Lordship sets
down some Words of mine concerning <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning</hi>
and <hi>Demonstration;</hi> and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<note n="†" place="margin">I Answ. p. 129.</note> 
               <hi>But if there be no way of coming to
Demonstration but this, I <hi>doubt</hi> we must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
without it.</hi> Which being nothing but a
Declaration of your <hi>doubt,</hi> is, I grant, a
very short way of proving any Proposition;
and I shall leave to your Lordship the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
you have in such a Proof, since I
think it will scarce convince others.</p>
            <p>In the last place your Lordship argues,
<note n="*" place="margin">I Answ. p. 129-131.</note> that because I say, That the Idea in the
Mind proves not the Existence of that
thing whereof it is an Idea; therefore we
cannot know the actual Existence of any
thing by our Senses; because we know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but by the perceived Agreement of
Ideas. But if you had been pleased to have
consider'd my Answer there to the <hi>Scepticks,</hi>
whose Cause you here seem, with no small
vigour, to manage, you would, I humbly
conceive, have found, that you mistake one
thing for another, <hi>viz.</hi> The Idea that has
by a former Sensation been lodged in the
Mind, for actually receiving any Idea, <hi>i. e.
actual Sensation,</hi> which I think I need not
go about to prove, are two distinct things,
after what you have here quoted out of
my Book. Now the two Ideas, that in
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65912:142"/>
this Case are perceived to agree, and do
thereby produce Knowledge, are the Idea
of <hi>actual Sensation</hi> (which is an Action where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I have a clear and distinct Idea) and
the Idea of <hi>actual Existence</hi> of something
without me that causes that Sensation. And
what other Certainty your Lordship has by
your Senses of the existing of any thing
without you, but the perceived Connection
of those two Ideas, I would gladly know.
When you have destroyed this Certainty,
which I conceive is the utmost, as to this
Matter, which our infinitely Wise and
Bountiful Maker has made us capable of in
this State, your Lordship will have well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
the <hi>Scepticks</hi> in carrying their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against Certainty by Sense, beyond
what they could have expected.</p>
            <p>I cannot but fear, my Lord, that what
you have said here in favour of <hi>Scepticism,</hi>
against Certainty by Sense, (for it is not
at all against me, till you shew we can have
no Idea of actual Sensation) without the
Proper Antidote annexed in shewing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that Certainty consists (if the account I
give be not true) after you have so stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
endeavoured to destroy, what I have
said for it, will, by your Authority, have
laid no small Foundation of <hi>Scepticism,</hi>
which they will not fail to lay hold of,
with advantage to their Cause, who have
any Disposition that way. For I desire any
one to read this your fifth Argument, and
then judge which of us two is a promoter
of <hi>Scepticism:</hi> I who have endeavoured, and,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65912:142"/>
as I think, proved Certainty by our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
or your Lordship, who has (in your
Thoughts at least) destroyed these Proofs,
without giving us any other to supply their
place. All your other Arguments amount
to no more but this, That I have given
Instances to shew, that the extent of our
Knowledge, in comparison of the whole
extent of <hi>Being</hi> is very little and narrow;
which when <hi>your Lordship writ your Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Doctrin of the Trinity,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Vindic P. 244.</note> 
               <hi>were very
fair and ingenuous Confessions of the shortness
of Humane Vnderstanding, with respect to the
Nature and Manner of such things, which we
are most certain of the Being of, by constant and
undoubted Experience:</hi> Though since you have
shewed your dislike of them in more places
than one, particularly, <hi>p.</hi> 33.<note n="‖" place="margin">I Answ. p. 33.</note>; and again
more at large, <hi>p.</hi> 43.<note n="†" place="margin">ib. p. 43-45.</note>; and at last you have
thought fit to represent them as Arguments
for <hi>Scepticism.</hi> And thus I have acquitted
my self, I hope to your Lordship's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
of my promise to answer your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
of <hi>a tendency to Scepticism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to your second Letter where
I left off. In the following Pages<note n="*" place="margin">p. 76-87.</note> you
have another Argument to prove <hi>my way
of Certainty to be none, but to lead to Scepticism;</hi>
which after a serious perusal of it, seems
to me to amount to no more but this,
That <hi>Des Cartes</hi> and I go both in <hi>the way of
Ideas;</hi> and we differ, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the placing of
Certainty in the Perception of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Disagreement of Ideas, is no way
of Certainty, but leads to <hi>Scepticism,</hi> which
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65912:143"/>
is a Consequence I cannot admit: And I
think is no better than this; Your Lordship
and I differ, and yet we go both <hi>in the way of
Ideas, Ergo,</hi> the placing of Knowledge in
the Perception of the Agreement or Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Ideas, is <hi>no way of Certainty
at all, but leads to Scepticism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship will perhaps think I say
more than I can justifie, when I say, Your
Lordship goes in the <hi>way of Ideas;</hi> for you
will tell me, you do not place <hi>Certainty</hi> in
the Perception of the Agreement or Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Ideas. <hi>Answer.</hi> No more does
<hi>Des Cartes;</hi> and therefore in that Respect,
he and I went no more <hi>in the</hi> same <hi>way of
Ideas,</hi> than your Lordship and I do: From
whence it follows, That how much soever
he and I may differ in other Points, our
Difference is no more an Argument against
this Proposition, That Knowledge or Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
consists in the Perception of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
or Disagreement of Ideas, than
your Lordship's and my Difference in any
other Point, is an Argument against the
Truth of that my definition of Knowledge;
or that it <hi>tends to Scepticism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will say, That <hi>Des Cartes</hi> built
his System of Philosophy upon Ideas; and so
I say does your Lordship too, and every
one else as much as he, that has any Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem
of that or any other part of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
For Ideas are nothing but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Objects of our Minds in Thinking;
and your Lordship, I conclude, in building
your System of any part of Knowledge
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65912:143"/>
thinks on something; and therefore you can
no more <hi>build,</hi> or have any <hi>System</hi> of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
without Ideas, than you can think
without some immediate Objects of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Indeed, you do not so often use the
word <hi>Ideas</hi> as <hi>Des Cartes</hi> or I have done;
but using the things signified by that Term
as much as either of us (unless you can
think without an immediate Object of
Thinking) yours also <hi>is the way of Ideas,</hi>
as much as his or mine. Your condemning
the <hi>way of Ideas,</hi> in those general Terms,
which one meets with so often in your
Writings on this Occasion, amounts at last
to no more, but an Exception against a
poor Sound of three Syllables, though your
Lordship thinks fit not to own, that you
have any Exception to it.</p>
            <p>If besides this, these ten or twelve Pages
have any other Argument in them, which
I have not seen, I humbly desire you would
be pleased to put it into a Syllogism to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
my Reader, That I have silently pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by an Argument of importance; and
then I promise an Answer to it: And the
same Request and Promise I make to your
Lordship, in reference to all other Passages
in your Letter, wherein you think there is
any thing of moment unanswered.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship comes<note n="*" place="margin">p. 87.</note> to answer what
was in my former Letter, to shew, that
what you had said concerning Nature and
Person, was to me and several others,
whom I had talked with about it, hard to
be understood. To this purpose, the 16
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65912:144"/>
next Pages<note n="†" place="margin">p. 87-103.</note> are chiefly imploy'd to shew,
what <hi>Aristotle</hi> and others have said about
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>Natura,</hi> a Greek and a Latin Word,
neither of which is the English Word <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
nor can concern it at all till it be
proved, that <hi>Nature</hi> in English has in the
propriety of our Tongue, precisely the
same signification that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> had among the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Natura</hi> among the <hi>Romans.</hi> For
would it not be pretty harsh to an English
Ear, to say with <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 92 &amp; 96.</note> That <hi>Nature</hi>
is a <hi>corporeal Substance,</hi> or a <hi>corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is Nature?</hi> To instance but in this
one among those many various Senses,
which your Lordship proves he used the
term <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in: Or with <hi>Anaximander,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 96.</note>
That <hi>Nature is Matter,</hi> or <hi>Matter Nature:</hi>
Or with <hi>Sextus Empericus,</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">p. 98.</note> That <hi>Nature
is a principle of Life,</hi> or a <hi>principle of Life is
Nature. So</hi> that though <hi>the Philosophers of
old of all kinds,</hi> did understand the Sense of
the terms <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>Natura,</hi> in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
of their Countries, yet it does not
follow, what you would here<note n="†" place="margin">p. 99.</note> conclude
from thence, that they understood the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
signification of the Term <hi>Nature</hi> in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.
Nor has an English Man any more need
to consult those Grecians in their use of the
sound <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to know what <hi>Nature</hi> signifies
in English; than those Grecians had need
to consult our Writings, or bring instances
of the use of the word <hi>Nature</hi> in <hi>English</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
to justifie their using of the term
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in any Sense they had used it in in
<hi>Greek.</hi> The like may be said of what is
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65912:144"/>
brought<note n="*" place="margin">p. 99. 100.</note> out of the <hi>Greek Christian</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
for I think an English Man could be
scarce justified in saying in English, That
the <hi>Angels</hi> were <hi>Natures,</hi> because <hi>Theodoret</hi>
and St. <hi>Basil</hi> calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Indeed your Lordship<note n="†" place="margin">p. 102.</note> brings a Proof
from an Authority that is proper in the
Case, and would go a great way in it, for
it is of an English Man, who writing of
<hi>Nature,</hi> gives an account of the signification
of the word <hi>Nature</hi> in English. But the
mischief is, that among Eight significations
of the word <hi>Nature,</hi> which he gives, that
is not to be found, which you quote him
for, and had need of. For he says not that
<hi>Nature</hi> in English is used for <hi>Substance;</hi>
which is the Sense your Lordship has used
it in and would justifie by the Authority of
that <hi>ingenious and honourable Person;</hi> and to
make it out you tell us, Mr. <hi>Boyle says the
word Essence is of great affinity to Nature, if
not of an adequate import,</hi> to which your
Lordship adds, <hi>But the real Essence of a thing
is a Substance.</hi> So that in fine, the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this excellent Person and Philosopher
amounts to thus much, that he says that
<hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Essence</hi> are two Terms that have
a great affinity, and you say, that <hi>Nature</hi>
and <hi>Substance</hi> are two Terms that have a
great affinity. For the learned Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>
says no such thing, nor can it appear, that
he ever thought so, till it can be shewn, that
he has said that <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> have
the same signification.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:65912:145"/>
I humbly conceive, it would have been a
strange way in any Body but your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
to have quoted an Author for saying
that <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> had the same sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
when one of those Terms, <hi>viz.
Substance,</hi> he does not upon that occasion so
much as Name. But your Lordship has this
Priviledge, it seems to speak of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
as if they were other Mens Words,
whereof I think I have given several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
I am sure I have given one; where
you<note n="*" place="margin">p. 63.</note> seem to speak of <hi>clear and distinct Ideas</hi>
as my Words, when they are only your
Words there infer'd from my words <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Knowledge;</hi> and other the like Instances
might be produced, were there any need.</p>
            <p>Had your Lordship produced Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s
Testimony, that <hi>Nature</hi> in our Tongue had
the same signification with <hi>Substance,</hi> I should
presently have submitted to so great an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and taken it for proper English,
and a clear way of expressing ones self, to
use <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> promiscuously one
for another. But since I think there is no
Instance of any one who ever did so, and
therefore it must be a new, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no very clear way of Speaking; give me
leave, my Lord, to wonder, why in all
this Dispute about the term <hi>Nature,</hi> upon
the clear and right understanding whereof,
you lay so much stress, you have not been
pleased to define it; which would put an
end to all Disputes about the meaning of
it, and leave no doubtfulness, no obscurity
in your use of it, nor any room for any
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65912:145"/>
Dispute what you mean by it. This would
have saved many Pages of Paper, though
perhaps it would have made us lose your
learned Account of what the Ancients have
said concerning <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the several ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptations
they used it in.</p>
            <p>All the other Authors Greek and Latin
your Lordship has quoted, may, for ought
I know, have used the Terms <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura,</hi>
properly in their Languages; and
have discoursed very clearly and intelligibly
about what those Terms in their Countries
signified. But how that proves, there was
no difficulties in the Sense or Construction
in that Discourse of yours, concerning <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
which I, and those I consulted upon
it, did not understand, is hard to see. Your
Lordship's Discourse was obscure and too
difficult then for me, and so I must own it
is still. Whether my Friend be any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enlightened by what you have said to
him here, out of so many ancient Authors,
I am too remote from him at the Writing
of this to know, and so shall not trouble
your Lordship with any Conversation, which
perhaps when we meet again we may have
upon it.</p>
            <p>The next Passage of your Vindication,
which was complained of to be very hard
to be understood, was this, where you say,
<note n="*" place="margin">Vindic. p. 253.</note> That you grant that by Sensation and Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we come to know the Powers and Properties
of Things; but our Reason is satisfied that there
must be something beyond these; because it is
impossible they should subsist by themselves. So
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65912:146"/>
               <hi>that the nature of things properly belongs to our
Reason, and not to meer Ideas.</hi> To rectifie
the mistake had been made in my first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
P. 157. in taking <hi>Reason</hi> here to mean
the Faculty of Reason, you tell me<note n="†" place="margin">I Answ: p. 101.</note> 
               <hi>I might
easily have seen, that by Reason your Lordship
understood Principles of Reason allowed by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
To which it was replied,<note n="‖" place="margin">2 Let. p. 125. 126.</note> That
then this Passage of yours, must be read
thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>your Lordship grants that by
Sensation and Reflection we come to know the
properties of things; but our Reason,</hi> i. e. the
Principles of Reason allowed by Mankind
<hi>are satisfied that there must be something be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
these; because it is impossible they should
subsist by themselves. So that the Nature of
things properly belongs to our Reason,</hi> i. e. to
the Principles of Reason allowed by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<hi>and not to meer. </hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Ideas,</hi> which made
it seem more unintelligible than it was
before.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To the complaint was made of the unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibleness
of this Passage in this last Sense
given by your Lordship, you answer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
So that we [<hi>i. e.</hi> my Friends whom
I consulted and I] are still excusable if not
understanding what is signified by these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.
<hi>The Principles of Reason allowed
by Mankind are satisfied,</hi> and, <hi>the Nature of
Things properly belongs to the Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
allowed by Mankind,</hi> we see not the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection</hi>
of the Propositions here tied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Words <hi>so that,</hi> which was the
thing complained of in these Words, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter p. 121.</note> 
               <q>That the inference here, both for its
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65912:146"/>
Connection and Expression seemed hard
to be understood;</q> and more to the
same Purpose, which your Lordship takes
no notice of.</p>
            <p>Indeed your Lordship repeats these Words
of mine, <q>That in both Senses of the word
<hi>Reason,</hi> either taken for a Faculty, or for
<hi>the Principles of Reason allowed by Mankind;</hi>
Reason and Ideas may consist together;</q>
and then subjoins,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 105.</note> That <hi>this leads your
Lordship to the Examination of that which may
be of some use,</hi> viz. <hi>To shew the difference of my
Method of Certainty by Ideas, and the Method
of Certainty by Reason.</hi> Which how it any
way justifies your opposing <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi>
as you here, and elsewhere often do; or
shews, That <hi>Ideas</hi> are inconsistent <hi>with the
Principles of Reason allowed by Mankind,</hi> I leave
to the Reader to judge. Your Lordship
for the clearing of what you had said, in
your <hi>Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. from Obscurity and
Unintelligibleness, which were complained
of in it; is to prove, That <hi>Ideas</hi> are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with <hi>the Principles of Reason allowed by
Mankind;</hi> and in Answer to this, you say,
you <hi>will shew the difference of my Method of
Certainty by Ideas, and the Method of Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, as I remember, the Expression
in Question, was not, <hi>That the Nature of
Things properly belongs to our Reason, and not
to my Method of Certainty by Ideas:</hi> But this,
<hi>That the Nature of Things belongs to our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and not to meer Ideas.</hi> So that the thing
you were here to shew, was, That Reason,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65912:147"/>
i. e. <hi>the Principles of Reason allowed by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi>
and <hi>Ideas,</hi> and not the <hi>Principles of
Reason,</hi> and <hi>my Method of Certainty by Ideas,
cannot consist together:</hi> For the <hi>Principles of
Reason allowed by Mankind,</hi> and <hi>Ideas,</hi> may
consist together; though perhaps, <hi>my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Certainty by Ideas,</hi> should prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with those <hi>Principles:</hi> So that if
all that you say, from this to the 153 Page,
<hi>i. e.</hi> forty eight Pages were as clear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
as I humbly conceive it is the
contrary; yet it does nothing to clear the
Passage in hand, but leaves that part of
your Discourse, concerning <hi>Nature,</hi> lying
still under the Objection was made against
it, as much, as if you had not said one
Word.</p>
            <p>But since, I am not unwilling that my
Method of Certainty should be examin'd;
and I should be glad (if there be any Faults
in it) to learn the Defects of that my Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of Knowledge, from so great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
as your Lordship; I will consider what
you here say, <hi>to shew the Difference of my
Method of Certainty by Ideas, and the Method
of Certainty by Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordship says,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 105.</note> That the way of
Certainty by Reason lies in two things.</p>
            <p>1. The Certainty of Principles.</p>
            <p>2. The Certainty of Deductions.</p>
            <p>I grant, That a part of that which is called
<hi>Certainty by Reason,</hi> lies in the Certainty of
Principles; which <hi>Principles,</hi> I presume,
your Lordship and I are agreed, are several
Propositions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:65912:147"/>
If then these Principles are Propositions,
to shew the Difference between your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
<hi>way of Certainty by Reason,</hi> and my <hi>way
of Certainty by Ideas;</hi> I think it is visible,
That you ought to shew wherein the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of those Propositions consists in your
<hi>way by Reason,</hi> different from that wherein
I make it consist in <hi>my way by Ideas.</hi> As for
Example, your Lordship and I are agreed,
that this Proposition, <hi>whatsoever is is,</hi> is a
Principle of Reason, or a <hi>Maxim.</hi> Now
<hi>my way of Certainty by Ideas,</hi> is, That the
<hi>Certainty</hi> of this Proposition consists in this,
that there is a perceivable Connection or
Agreement, between the Idea of <hi>Being</hi> and
the Idea of <hi>Being,</hi> or between the Idea of
<hi>Existence</hi> and the Idea of <hi>Existence,</hi> as is
expressed in that Proposition. But now in
your <hi>way of Reason,</hi> pray, wherein does the
Certainty of this Proposition consist? If it
be in any thing different from that perceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Agreement of the Ideas, affirm'd of one
another in it, I beseech your Lordship to tell
it me; if not, I beg leave to conclude, that your
<hi>way of Certainty by Reason,</hi> and <hi>my way of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
by Ideas,</hi> in this Case are just the same.</p>
            <p>But instead of saying any thing, to shew
wherein the <hi>Certainty of Principles</hi> is different
in the way of Reason, from the <hi>Certainty of
Principles</hi> in the way of Ideas, upon my
Friends shewing, That you had no ground
to say as you did; That <hi>I had no Idea of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
as it stands for Principles of Reason,
your Lordship takes occasion (as what will
not, in a skillful hand, serve to introduce
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65912:148"/>
any thing one has a mind to) to tell me,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 106.</note>
               <hi>What Ideas I have of <hi>them</hi> must appear from
my Book; and you do there find a Chapter of
self-evident Propositions and Maxims, which
you cannot but think extraordinary for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of it, which is thus summed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">B. 4. C. §. 20.</note> viz. <hi>That it was to shew,</hi> 
               <q>That these
Maxims as they are of little Use, where
we have clear and distinct Ideas, so they
are of dangerous Use, where our Ideas
are not clear and distinct.</q> 
               <hi>And is not this
a fair way to convince your Lordship, that my
way of Ideas is very consistent with the Certainty
of Reason, when the way of Reason bath been
always supposed to proceed upon general Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and I assert them to be useless and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Words I crave leave to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</p>
            <p>1. That the Pronoun them here, seems to
have Reference to <hi>self-evident Propositions,</hi> to
<hi>Maxims,</hi> and to <hi>Principles,</hi> as Terms used
by your Lordship and me; though it be
certain, That you and I use them in a far
different Sense: For, if I mistake not, you
use them all three promiscuously one for
another; whereas 'tis plain, That in that
Chapter,<note n="†" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 7.</note> out of which you bring your
Quotations here, I distinguish self-evident
Propositions from those, which I there
mention under the Name of Maxims, which
are principally these two, <hi>Whatsoever is is,</hi>
and <hi>it is impossible for the same thing to be and
not to be.</hi> Farther, it is plain, out of the
same place, That by Maxims I there mean
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65912:148"/>
general Propositions, which are so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
received under the Name of Maxims
or Axioms, that they are looked upon as
innate; the two chief whereof, principally
there meant, are those above-mentioned:
But what the Propositions are which you
comprehend under <hi>Maxims,</hi> or <hi>Principles of
Reason,</hi> cannot be determined, since your
Lordship neither defines, nor enumerates
them; and so 'tis impossible, precisely, to
know what you mean by <hi>them</hi> here: And
that which makes me more at a loss, is,
That in this Argument,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 108.</note> you set down for
Principles or Maxims, Propositions that are
not so much as self-evident, <hi>viz.</hi> This, <hi>That
the Essential Properties of a Man, are to reason
and discourse,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. I crave leave to observe, That you tell
me, That in my Book <hi>you find a Chapter of
self-evident Propositions and Maxims,</hi> whereas
I find no such Chapter in my Book: I have
in it indeed, a Chapter of <hi>Maxims,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
an one entitled, <hi>Of self-evident Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Maxims.</hi> This 'tis possible your
Lordship will call <hi>a nice Criticism;</hi> but yet
it is such an one, as is very necessary in the
Cafe: For in that Chapter I, as is before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
expresly distinguish <hi>self-evident Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi>
from <hi>the received Maxims or Axioms,</hi>
which I there speak of: Whereas it seems
to me, to be your Design (in joining them
in a Title of a Chapter, contrary to what I
had done) to have it thought, That I treated
of them as one and the same thing; and so
all that I said there, of the Uselessness of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65912:149"/>
some few general Propositions, under the
Title of <hi>received Maxims,</hi> might be applied
to all <hi>self-evident Propositions,</hi> the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
whereof was the Design of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For that which I endeavour to shew
there, is, That all our Knowledge is not
built on those few received general Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
which are ordinarily called <hi>Maxims</hi>
or <hi>Axioms;</hi> but that there are a great many
Truths may be known without them: But that
there is any Knowledge without self-evident
Propositions, I am so far from denying,
that I am accused by your Lordship for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
in Demonstration, more such than
you think are necessary. This seems, I say,
to be your Design; and I wish your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
by entitling my Chapter as I my self
did, and not as it would best serve your
turn, had not made it necessary for me to
make this <hi>nice Criticism.</hi> This is certain,
That without thus confounding <hi>Maxims</hi>
and <hi>self-evident Propositions,</hi> what you here
say, would not so much, as in Appearance,
concern me: For,</p>
            <p>3. I crave leave to observe, That all the
Argument your Lordship uses here against
me to prove, That my way of Certainty
by Ideas, is inconsistent with the <hi>way of
Certainty by Reason, which lies in the Certainty
of Principles,</hi> is this, <hi>That the way of Reason
hath been alway supposed to proceed upon general
Principles, and I assert <hi>them</hi> to be useless and
dangerous.</hi> Be pleased, my Lord, to define
or enumerate your <hi>general Principles,</hi> and
then we shall see whether <hi>I assert <hi>them</hi> to be
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65912:149"/>
useless and dangerous,</hi> and whether they, who
<hi>supposed the way of Reason, was to proceed upon
general Principles,</hi> differ'd from me; and if
they did differ, whether theirs was more
the way of Reason than mine: But to talk
thus of <hi>General Principles, which have always
been supposed the way of Reason,</hi> without telling
so much as which, or what they are, is not
so much as by Authority to shew, That my
way of Certainty by Ideas, is <hi>inconsistent
with the way of Certainty by Reason:</hi> Much
less is it in reality to prove it. Because ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
I had said any thing contrary to
what, as you say, <hi>has been always supposed,</hi> its
being supposed, proves it not to be true;
because we know that several things have
been for many Ages generally <hi>supposed,</hi>
which at last, upon Examination, have been
found not to be true.</p>
            <p>What <hi>hath been always supposed,</hi> is fit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for your Lordship's great Reading to
declare: But such Arguments, I confess,
are wholly lost upon me, who have not
Time or Occasion to examine what has <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been supposed;</hi> especially in those Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
which concern Truths, that are to
be known from the Nature of things. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
I think, they cannot be established
by Majority of Votes, not easie to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
nor if they were collected, can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
Certainty till it can be <hi>supposed,</hi> that
the greater part of Mankind are always in
the right. In Matters of Fact, I own we
must govern our selves by the Testimonies
of others; but in Matters of Speculation
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65912:150"/>
to <hi>suppose</hi> on, as <hi>others have supposed</hi> before
us, is supposed by many to be only a way
to learned Ignorance, which enables to talk
much and know but little. The Truths,
which the Penetration and Labours of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
before us have discovered and made
out, I own, we are infinitely indebted to
them for; and some of them are of that
Consequence, that we cannot acknowledge
too much, the advantages we receive from
those great Masters in Knowledge: But
where they only <hi>supposed,</hi> they left it to us
to search, and advance farther. And in
those things, I think, it becomes our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
to employ it self, for the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Knowledge, and adding to the
Stock of Discoveries left us by our inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
and thinking Predecessors.</p>
            <p>4. One thing more I crave leave to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
<hi>viz.</hi> That to these Words, <q>These
Maxims, as they are of little use where
we have clear and distinct Ideas, so they
are of dangerous Use where our Ideas are
not clear and distinct,</q> quoted out of
my <hi>Essay,</hi> you subjoin,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 106.</note> 
               <hi>And is not this a
fair way to convince your Lordship, that my
way of Ideas is very consistent with the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Reason? Answer.</hi> My Lord, my <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi>
and those Words in it, were writ many
Years before I dreamt, that you or any body
else would ever question the consistency
of <hi>my way of Certainty by Ideas, with the
way of Certainty by Reason;</hi> and so could not
be intended to convince your Lordship in
this Point: And since you first said, That
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65912:150"/>
these two ways are inconsistent, I never
brought those Words <hi>to convince you, That
my way is consistent with the Certainty of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:</hi>
And therefore why you ask, whether
that <hi>be a fair way to convince you,</hi> which was
never made use of as any <hi>way to convince you</hi>
of any such thing, is hard to imagin.</p>
            <p>But your Lordship goes on in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Words, with the like kind of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 106-107.</note> where you tell me, that I say,
<note n="*" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 7. Sect. 4.</note> 
               <q>That my first design is to prove,
That the consideration of those general
Maxims adds nothing to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or Certainty of Knowledge;</q>
which says your Lordship, <hi>Overthrows all that
which hath been accounted Science and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
and must lay the Foundation of Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism;
because our true Grounds of Certainty
depend upon some general Principle of Reason.
To make this plain, you say, you will put a Case
grounded upon my Words; which are, That I</hi>
have discoursed with very rational Men,
who have actually deny'd that they are Men.
These Words J. S. <hi>understands as spoken of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and charges them with very ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences;
but you think they are capable of an
other meaning: However,</hi> says your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
let us put the Case, That Men did in
earnest question, whether they were Men or
not; and then you do not see, if I set aside ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Maxims, how I can convince them, that
they are Men. For the way your Lordship
looks on as most apt to prevail upon such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Sceptical Men, is by general Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
and Principles of Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:65912:151"/>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> I can neither in that Paragraph
nor Chapter, find that I say, <hi>That my first
design is to prove, that these general Maxims
[i. e.</hi> those which your Lordship calls ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Principles of Reason] <hi>add nothing to
the Evidence and Certainty of Knowledge</hi> in
general: For so these Words must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to make good the Consequence
which your Lordship charges on them, <hi>viz.
That they overthrow all that has been accounted
Science and Demonstration, and lay the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Scepticism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>my design</hi> in that place is, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from these Words in the foregoing
Paragraph,<note n="†" place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> 
               <q>Let us consider whether
this Self-evidence be peculiar only to
those Propositions, which are received
for Maxims, and have the Dignity of
Axioms allowed; and here 'tis plain,
that several other Truths, not allowed
to be Axioms, partake equally with them
in this Self-evidence;</q> which shews
that my design there was to evince, that
there were Truths that are not called Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims,
that are as Self-evident as those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Maxims. Pursuant to this <hi>design,</hi> I
say,<note n="*" place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> 
               <q>That the consideration of these
Axioms</q> [<hi>i. e.</hi> whatsoever is, is; and it is
impossible for the same thing to be and
not to be] <q>can add nothing to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Certainty of its [<hi>i. e.</hi> the Minds]
Knowledge</q> [<hi>i. e.</hi> of the Truth of more
particular Propositions concerning Identity].
These are my Words in that place, and
that the Sense of them is according to the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65912:151"/>
Limitation annexed to them; between those
Crotchets I refer my Reader to that fourth
Section, where he will find that all that I say
amounts to no more but what is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in these Words, in the close of it;
<q>I appeal to every one's own Mind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Proposition, <hi>A Circle is a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi>
be not as Self-evident a Proposition,
as that consisting of more general Terms,
<hi>Whatsoever is, is:</hi> And again, whether
this Proposition, <hi>Blue is not Red,</hi> be not
a Proposition that the Mind can no more
doubt of, as soon as it understands the
Words, than it does of that Axiom, <hi>It
is impossible for the same thing to be and
not to be?</hi> and so of all the like.</q> And
now I ask your Lordship, whether you do
affirm of this, That <hi>it overthrows all that
which hath been counted Science and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
and must lay the Foundation of Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism?</hi>
If you do, I shall desire you to
prove it; if you do not, I must desire you
to consider how fairly my Sense has been
represented.</p>
            <p>But supposing you had represented my
Sense right, and that the little or dangerous
use which I there limit to certain Maxims,
had been meant of all <hi>Principles of Reason</hi> in
general, in your Sense, what had this been,
my Lord, to the Question under debate?
Your Lordship undertakes to shew,
That your way of Certainty by Reason is
different from my way of Certainty by
Ideas. To do this, you say in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Page,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 105.</note> 
               <hi>That Certainty by Reason, lies
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65912:152"/>
1. In Certainty of Principles, 2. In Certainty
of Deductions.</hi> The first of these you are
upon here, and if in order to what you had
undertaken, your Lordship had shewn, That
in your way by Reason, those Principles
were certain; but in my way by Ideas, we
could not attain to any Certainty concerning
them. This, indeed, had been to shew a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
between my way of Certainty, which
you call the <hi>way by Ideas;</hi> and yours, which
you call the <hi>way by Reason,</hi> in this part of
Certainty, that lies in the <hi>Certainty of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
I have said in the Words quoted by
your Lordship, That the consideration of
those two Maxims, <hi>What is, is;</hi> and <hi>it is
impossible for the same thing to be and not to
be,</hi> are not of use to add any thing to the
Evidence or Certainty of our Knowledge
of the Truth of Identical Predications; but
I never said those Maxims were in the least
uncertain; I may perhaps think otherwise
of their use, than your Lordship does, but
I think no otherwise of their Truth and
Certainty than you do; they are left in
their full Force and Certainty for your use,
if you can make any better use of them,
than what I think can be made: So that in
respect of the allowed Certainty of those
Principles, my way differs not at all from
your Lordship's.</p>
            <p>Pray, my Lord, look over that Chapter
again, and see whether I bring their Truth
and Certainty any more into Question, than
you your self do; and 'tis about their
<hi>Certainty,</hi> and not Use, that the Question
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65912:152"/>
here is between your Lordship and me:
We both agree, That they are both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
Certain; all then that you bring
in the following Pages about their Use, is
nothing to the present Question about <hi>the
Certainty of Principles,</hi> which your Lordship
is upon in this place; and you will prove,
That your way of <hi>Certainty by Reason,</hi> is
different from my <hi>way of Certainty by Ideas;</hi>
when you can shew, That you are certain
of the Truth of those, or any other <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims</hi>
any otherwise, than by the Perception
of the Agreement or Disagreement of Ideas
as expressed in them.</p>
            <p>But your Lordship passing by that whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
endeavours to prove, that my saying,
That the consideration of those two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Maxims can add nothing to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Certainty of Knowledge in Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Predications (for that is all that I there
say) <hi>overthrows all that has been accounted Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Demonstration, and must lay the
Foundation of Scepticism,</hi> and 'tis by a very
remarkable Proof, <hi>viz. Because our true
Grounds of Certainty depend upon some general
Principles of Reason;</hi> which is the very thing
I there not only deny, but have disproved;
and therefore should not, I humbly conceive,
have been rested on as a Proof of any
thing else, till my Arguments against it
had been answered.</p>
            <p>But instead of that, your Lordship says,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 107.</note> You will put a Case that shall make it
plain, which is the Business of the six fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Pages, which are spent in this Case.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:65912:153"/>
The Case is founded upon a Supposition,
which you seem willing to have thought
that you borrowed either from <hi>I. S.</hi> or
from me: Whereas, truly that Supposition
is neither that Gentleman's nor mine, but
purely your Lordship's own. For however
grosly Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> has mistaken (which he has
since acknowledg'd in Print) the obvious
Sense of those Words of my <hi>Essay</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">B. 4. C. 7. Sect. 17.</note> on
which you say <hi>you ground your Case;</hi> yet,
I must do him Right herein, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
supposed not, that any Man in his
Wits, ever <hi>in earnest questioned whether he
himself were a Man or no;</hi> though by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
(which I cannot but wonder at, in
one so much exercised in Controversie as
Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi>) he charged me with saying
it.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship indeed says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 107.</note> 
               <hi>That you
think my Words there may have an other mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
Would you thereby insinuate, That
you think it possible they should have that
meaning which <hi>I. S.</hi> once gave them? If
you do not, my Lord, Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> and his
<hi>understanding them so,</hi> is in vain brought in
here to countenance your making such a
Supposition. If you do think those Words
of my <hi>Essay</hi> capable of such a meaning as
<hi>I. S.</hi> gave them, there will appear a strange
Harmony between your Lordship's and Mr.
<hi>I. S.</hi>'s Understanding, when he mistakes
what is said in my Book: Whether it will
continue now Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> takes me right, I
know not; but let us come to the Case as
you put it. Your Words<note n="*" place="margin">p. 107.</note> are,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:65912:153"/>
               <hi>Let us put the Case, That Men did in earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
question whether they were Men or not.</hi>
Your Lordship says, <hi>You do not then see, if
I set aside general Maxims, how I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them that they are Men. Answer.</hi> And
do you, my Lord, see that with <hi>Maxims,</hi>
you can convince them of that or any thing
else? I confess, whatever you should do,
I should think it scarce worth while to
Reason with them about any thing. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you are the first that ever supposed
a Man so much besides himself, as to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whether he were a Man or no, and
yet so rational, as to be thought capable
of being convinced of that or any thing
by Discourse of Reason. This, methinks,
is little different from supposing a Man in
and out of his Wits at the same time.</p>
            <p>But let us suppose your Lordship so lucky
with your Maxims, that you do convince
a Man (that doubts of it) that he is a Man;
what Proof, I beseech you, my Lord, is
that of this Proposition, <hi>That our true
Grounds of Certainty depend upon some general
Principles of Reason?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the contrary, suppose it should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
as is the more likely, that your set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon him with your <hi>Maxims</hi> cannot
convince him; are we not by this your
Case to take this for a Proof, That <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Principles of Reason are not the Grounds of
Certainty?</hi> For 'tis upon the success, or not
success of your Endeavours, to convince
such a Man with Maxims, that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
puts the Proof of this Proposition,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65912:154"/>
               <hi>That our true Grounds of Certainty depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
general Principles of Reason:</hi> The Issue
whereof must remain in suspense, till you
have found such a Man to bring it to Tryal;
and so the Proof is far enough off, unless
you think the Case so plain, that every one
sees such a Man will be presently convinced
by your Maxims, though I should think it
probable that most People may think he
will not.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship adds,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 107.</note> 
               <hi>For the way you
look on as most apt to prevail upon such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Sceptical Men, is by general Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
and Principles of Reason. Answer.</hi> This
indeed, is a Reason why your Lordship
should use <hi>Maxims</hi> when you have to do
with <hi>such extraordinary Sceptical Men;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>you look on it as the likeliest way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</hi>
But pray, my Lord, is your <hi>looking
on it as the best way to prevail on such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Sceptical Men,</hi> any Proof, That <hi>our
true Grounds of Certainty depend upon some
general Principles of Reason;</hi> for 'twas <hi>to
make this plain</hi> that this Case was <hi>put?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther, my Lord, give me leave to ask,
what have we here to do with the ways
of convincing others of what they do not
know, or assent to? Your Lordship and I
are not as, I think, disputing of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods</hi>
of <hi>perswading</hi> others of what they are
ignorant of, and do not yet assent to; but
our debate here, is about the Ground of
<hi>Certainty</hi> in what they do know, and assent
to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:65912:154"/>
However, you go on<note n="*" place="margin">p. 107 &amp; 108.</note> to set down se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Maxims</hi> which you look on as most
apt to prevail upon your <hi>extraordinary Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Man,</hi> to <hi>convince</hi> him that he Exists,
and that he is a Man. The Maxims
are,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 108.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That nothing can have no Operations.</p>
            <p>That all different sorts of Being are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
by Essential Properties.</p>
            <p>That the Essential Properties of a Man, are
to Reason, Discourse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That these Properties cannot subsist by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
without a real Substance.</p>
            <p>I will not question whether a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know, that he exists; or be certain (for
'tis of Knowledge and Certainty the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
here is) that he is a Man, without
the help of these Maxims. I will only crave
leave to ask, how you know that these are
<hi>Maxims?</hi> For methinks this, <hi>That the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential
Properties of a Man are Reason, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi>
&amp;c. an imperfect Proposition, with
<hi>and so forth</hi> at the end of it, is a pretty sort
of Maxim. That therefore which I desire
to be informed here, is, how your Lordship
knows these, or any other Propositions to
be <hi>Maxims;</hi> and how Propositions, that
are <hi>Maxims,</hi> are to be distinguished from
Propositions that are not <hi>Maxims?</hi> And the
Reason why I insist upon it, is this: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this, and this only, would shew, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what I have said in my Chapter about
<hi>Maxims, overthrows all that has been accounted
Science and Demonstration, and lays the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Scepticism.</hi> But I fear my Request,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65912:155"/>
That you would be pleased to tell me,
what you mean by <hi>Maxims,</hi> that I may
know, what Propositions, according to
your Lordship, are, and what are not Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims,
will not easily be granted me: Because
it would presently put an end to all that you
impute to me, as said, in that Chapter
against Maxims, in a Sense, that I use not
the Word there.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship<note n="*" place="margin">p. 109.</note> makes me, out of my
Book, answer to the use you make of the
Four above-mentioned Propositions, which
you call <hi>Maxims,</hi> as if I were declared of
an Opinion, That <hi>Maxims</hi> could not be of
any use in Arguing with others: Which
methinks you should not have done, if you
had considered my Chapter <hi>of Maxims,</hi>
which you so often quote, For I there say,
<note n="†" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 7. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 11.</note> 
               <q>Maxims are useful to stop the Mouths
of Wranglers—to shew, That
wrong Opinions lead to Absurdities,&amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship nevertheless,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 109.</note> goes on
to prove, That <hi>without the help of these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
or</hi> Maxims, <hi>I cannot prove to any, that
doubt it, that they are Men in my way of Ideas.
Answ.</hi> I beseech you, my Lord, to give
me leave to mind you again, that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is not, what I can prove; but whether
in my way by Ideas, I cannot without the
help <hi>of these Principles</hi> know, that I am a
Man; and be certain of the Truth of that,
and several other Propositions: I say of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Propositions. For I do not
think you in your <hi>way of Certainty by Reason,</hi>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:65912:155"/>
pretend to be certain of all Truths; or to
be able to prove (to those who doubt) all
Propositions, or so much as be able to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi>
every one of the Truth of every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
that you your self are certain of.
There be many Propositions in Mr. <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
excellent Book, which there are Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of people, and those a little more
Rational, than such as should deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be Men; whom Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
would not be able, with or without the
use of <hi>Maxims</hi> used in Mathematicks, to
<hi>convince</hi> of the Truth of: And yet this would
be no Argument against his Method of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
whereby he came to the Knowledge,
that they are True. What therefore you
can conclude, as to <hi>my way of Certainty,</hi>
from a Supposition of my not being able in
my way by Ideas, to <hi>convince</hi> those who
doubt of it, that they are Men, I do not see.
But your Lordship is resolved to prove that
I cannot, and so you go on.</p>
            <p>1. Your Lordship says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 110.</note> That <hi>I suppose
that we must have a</hi> clear and distinct Idea <hi>of
that we are certain of;</hi> and this you prove out
of my <hi>Chapter of Maxims,</hi> where I say, <q>That
every one knows the Ideas that he has,
and that distinctly and unconfusedly one
from another.</q> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I suspected all
along, that you mistook what I meant by
confused Ideas. If your Lordship pleases to
turn to my Chapter <hi>of distinct and confused
Ideas,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Essay B. 2. C. 29. § 4. 5, 6.</note> you will there find, that an Idea,
which is distinguished in the Mind from all
others, may yet be confused: The Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65912:156"/>
being made by a careless Application of
distinct Names to Ideas, that are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
distinct. Which having explained
at large, in that Chapter, I shall not need
here again to repeat. Only permit me to
set down an Instance. He that has the Idea
of the Liquor that Circulating through the
Heart of a Sheep, keeps that Animal alive,
and he that has the Idea of the Liquor that
Circulates through the Heart of a Lobster,
has two different Ideas; as distinct as an
Idea of an aqueous pellucid cold Liquor, is
from the Idea of a red opaque hot Liquor,
but yet these Two may be confounded by
giving the Name Blood to this vital circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
Liquor of a Lobster.</p>
            <p>This being considered will shew, how
what I have said there, may consist with
my saying, That to Certainty Ideas are not
required, that are in all their parts perfectly
clear and distinct: Because Certainty being
spoken there of the Knowledge of the Truth
of any Proposition, and Propositions being
made in Words, it may be true, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the Ideas we have in our
Minds, are, as far as we have them there,
clear and distinct; yet those which we would
suppose the Terms in the Proposition to
stand for, may not be clear and distinct
either.</p>
            <p>1. By making the Term stand for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Idea, which we have not yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
determined in our Minds, whereby
it comes to stand sometimes for one Idea,
sometimes for another. Which, though
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65912:156"/>
when we reflect on them, they are distinct
in our Minds, yet by this use of a Name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined
in its Signification, come to be
confounded. Or,</p>
            <p>2. By supposing the Name to stand for
something more than really is in the Idea
in our Minds, which we make it a sign of,
<hi>v. g.</hi> let us suppose, That a Man many
Years since, when he was Young, Eat a
Fruit, whose shape, size, consistency and
colour, he has a perfect Remembrance of;
but the particular Tast he has forgot, and
only remembers, that it very much delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him. This complex Idea, as far as it is
in his Mind, 'tis evident, is there; and as
far as he perceives it, when he reflects on
it, is in all its parts clear and distinct; but
when he calls it a <hi>Pine-Apple,</hi> and will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that Name stands for the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
complex Idea, for which another Man
(who newly Eat of that Fruit, and has the
Idea of the Tast of it also fresh in his Mind)
uses it, or for which he himself used it,
when he had the Tast fresh in his Memory,
'tis plain his complex Idea in that part,
which consists in the Tast, is very obscure.</p>
            <p>To apply this to what your Lordship
here<note n="*" place="margin">p. 110.</note> makes me suppose, I Answer,</p>
            <p>1. I do not suppose, That to Certainty
it is requisite, that an Idea should be in all
its parts clear and distinct. I can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that a <hi>Pine-Apple</hi> is not an Artichoak,
though my Idea, which I suppose that Name
to stand for, be in me obscure and confused,
in regard of its Tast.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:65912:157"/>
2. I do not deny, but on the contrary,
I affirm, That I can have a clear and distinct
Idea of a Man, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Idea I give the
name Man to, may be clear and distinct)
though it should be true, That Men are not
yet agreed on the determined Idea, that the
name Man shall stand for. Whatever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
there may be in the Idea, to which
that Name is indeterminately apply'd; I do
allow and affirm, That every one if he
pleases, may have a clear and distinct Idea
of a <hi>Man</hi> to himself, <hi>i. e.</hi> which he makes
the word <hi>Man</hi> stand for: Which, if he
makes known to others in his Discourse
with them about <hi>Man,</hi> all verbal Dispute
will cease, and he cannot be mistaken, when
he uses the term <hi>Man.</hi> And if this were
but done with most of the glittering Terms
brandised in Disputes, it would often be
seen how little some Men have to say, who
with equivocal Words and Expressions, make
no small noise in Controversie.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship concludes this part, by
saying,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 114.</note> 
               <hi>Thus you have shew'd how inconsistent
my way of Ideas is with true Certainty,</hi> and of
<hi>what use and necessity these general Principles
of Reason are. Answ.</hi> By the Laws of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
which in another place, you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
such a regard to, one is <hi>bound</hi> not to
change the Terms of the Question. This I
crave leave humbly to offer to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
because, as far as I have looked into
Controversie, I do not remember to have
met with any one so apt, shall I say, to
forget or change the question as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:65912:157"/>
This, my Lord, I should not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to say, but upon very good Grounds,
which I shall be ready to give you an account
of, whenever you shall demand it of me.
One Example of it we have here,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 114.</note> you say,
<hi>you have shew'd how inconsistent my way of Ideas
is with true Certainty; and of what use and
necessity these general Principles of Reason are.</hi>
My Lord, if you please to look back to the
105th Page, you will see, what you there
promised, was, to <hi>shew the difference of my
method of Certainty by Ideas, and the method
of Certainty by Reason:</hi> And particularly in
the Pages between that and this, the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Principles,</hi> which you say, is one
of those <hi>two Things, wherein the way of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
by Reason lies.</hi> Instead of that, your
Lordship concludes here, that you have
shew'd two Things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>How inconsistent my way of Ideas is with
true Certainty.</hi> Whereas it should be <hi>to shew
the inconsistency or difference of my method of
Certainty by Ideas, and the method of Certainty
by Reason:</hi> Which are Two very different
Propositions. And before you undertake
to shew, That my <hi>method of Certainty, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with <hi>true</hi> Certainty;</hi> it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for you to define, and tell us where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>true <hi>Certainty</hi>
               </hi> consists, which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
hitherto has shewn no great forwardness
to do.</p>
            <p>2. Another thing which you say, you have
done, is, That you have <hi>shewn of what use
and necessity <hi>these</hi> general Principles of Reason
are. Answ.</hi> Whether by <hi>these <hi>General Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
               </hi>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:65912:158"/>
you mean those Propositions, which
you set down, p. 108. and call there <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims,</hi>
or any other Propositions, which you
have not any where set down, I cannot tell.
But whatsoever they are, that you mean here
by <hi>these,</hi> I know not how the usefulness
of <hi>these</hi> your <hi>General Principles,</hi> be they what
they will, came to be a Question, between
your Lordship and me here. If you have
a Mind to shew any mistakes of mine in
my Chapter of <hi>Maxims,</hi> which you say,
<hi>you think extraordinary for the Design of it,</hi>
I shall not be unwilling to be rectified;
but that the usefulness of Principles, is not
what is here under debate between us, I,
with Submission, affirm. That which your
Lordship is here to prove, is, That the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Principles, which is the way of
Certainty by Reason, is different from my
way of Certainty by Ideas. Upon the
whole, I crave leave to say in your Words,
That <hi>thus I have,</hi> I humbly conceive, made
it appear, that you have not <hi>shewed any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
much less any inconsistency of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Certainty by Ideas, and the method of
Certainty by Reason,</hi> in that first Part, which
you assign of <hi>Certainty</hi> by <hi>Reason,</hi> viz. <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the second Part, which
you assign<note n="*" place="margin">p. 105.</note> of <hi>Certainty by Reason,</hi> viz.
<hi>Certainty of Deductions.</hi> I only crave leave
first to set down these Words in the latter
end of your Discourse, which we have been
considering, where your Lordship says, <hi>you
begin to think</hi> J. S. <hi>was in the right, when he
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:65912:158"/>
made me say,</hi> 
               <q>That I had discoursed with
very rational Men who denyed <hi>themselves</hi>
to be Men</q> 
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I do not know what
may be done by those who have such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over the Pronouns <hi>They</hi> and <hi>Them,</hi>
as to put <hi>they themselves</hi> for <hi>they.</hi> I shall
therefore desire my Reader to turn to that
Passage of my Book, and see, whether he
too can be so lucky as your Lordship, and
can with you <hi>begin to Think,</hi> that by these
Words,<note n="†" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 7. § 17.</note> 
               <q>Who have actually denyed,
that <hi>they,</hi> i. e. Infants and Changelings
are Men.</q> I meant, <hi>who actually denyed,
that <hi>they themselves</hi> were Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship, to prove my <hi>method of
Certainty by Ideas, to</hi> be different from, and
inconsistent with your second Part <hi>of the
Certainty by Reason,</hi> which you say, <hi>lies in
the Certainty of Deductions,</hi> begins thus:<note n="*" place="margin">p. 114.</note>
               <hi>That you come now to the Certainty of Reason,
in making Deductions; and here you shall briefly
lay down the Grounds of Certainty, which the
ancient Philosophers went upon, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
my way of Ideas with them.</hi> To which,
give me leave, my Lord, to Reply. (1.)
That, I humbly conceive, it should have
been <hi>Grounds of Certainty</hi> [in making De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions]
<hi>which the ancient Philosophers went
upon,</hi> or else they will be nothing to the
Proposition, which your Lordship has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
here to prove. Now of the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
in making Deductions, I see none of
the Ancients produced by your Lordship,
who say any thing to shew, wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists,
but <hi>Aristotle.</hi> Who, as you say,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 116.</note> in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65912:159"/>
his Method <hi>of infering one thing from another,
went upon this common Principle of Reason,
that what things agree in a Third, agree among
themselves.</hi> And it so falls out, That so far
as he goes towards the shewing, wherein the
<hi>Certainty of Deductions</hi> consists, he and I
agree, as is evident by what I say in my
Essay<note n="*" place="margin">B. 4. C. 2. § 2. &amp; C. 17. § 15.</note>. And if <hi>Aristotle</hi> had gon any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to shew, how we are certain, that those
two Things agree with a Third, he would
have placed that Certainty in the Perception
of that Agreement, as I have done, and
then he and I should have perfectly agreed.
I presume to say, if <hi>Aristotle</hi> had gon farther
in this matter, he would have placed our
Knowledge or Certainty of the Agreement
of any two Things in the Perception of their
Agreement. And let not any one from
hence think, I attribute too much to my
self, in saying, That that accute and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Philosopher, if he had gone farther
in that matter, would have done as I have
done. For if he omitted it, I imagin it was
not, that he did not see it, but that it was
so Obvious and Evident, that it appear'd
superfluous to name it. For who can doubt
that the Knowledge or being Certain, that
any two Things agree, consists in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of their Agreement? What else can
it possibly consist in? It is so obvious, that
it would be a little extraordinary to think,
that he that went so far could miss it. And
I should wonder, if any one should allow
the <hi>Certainty of Deduction,</hi> to consist in the
Agreement of two Things in a Third, and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65912:159"/>
yet should deny that the Knowledge or Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of that Agreement, consisted in the
Perception of it.</p>
            <p>(2.) In the next place, my Lord, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
my Method of Certainty, in making
Deductions, were different from those of
the Ancients; this, at best, would be only,
that which I call,<note n="*" place="margin">Essay B. C. 17. 4. Sect. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Argumentum ad Vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundiam;</hi>
which proves not on which side
Reason is, though I in Modesty should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
nothing to their Authorities.</p>
            <p>(3.) The Ancients, as it seems by your
Lordship, not agreeing one among another,
about the Grounds of Certainty; what can
their Authorities signifie in the Case? Or,
how will it appear, that I differ from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
in differing from any of them, more
than that they differ from Reason, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
one from another? And therefore,
after all the different Authorities, produced
by you, out of your great Treasure of
Reading, the matter will at last reduce it
self to this Point, That your Lordship should
tell us, wherein <hi>the Certainty of Reason, in
making Deductions</hi> consists; and then shew,
wherein my <hi>Method of making Deductions,</hi>
differs from it: Which whether you have
done or no, we shall see in what follows.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship closes your very Learned,
and to other Purposes very Useful, Account
of the Opinions of the Ancients, concerning
Certainty, with these Words;<note place="margin">p. 120.</note> 
               <hi>That thus
you have, in as few Words as you could, laid
together those old Methods of Certainty, which
have obtained greatest Reputation in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:65912:160"/>
Whereupon I must crave leave to mind you
again, That the Proposition, you are here
upon, and have undertaken to prove in this
place, is concerning the <hi>Certainty of Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and not concerning <hi>Certainty</hi> in general.
I say not this, that I am willing to decline
the Examination of <hi>my Method of Certainty</hi>
in general, any way, or in any place: But
I say it to observe, that in Discourses of
this Nature, the Laws of Disputation have
wisely ordered the Proposition under De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
to be kept to, and that in the same
Terms to avoid Wandring, Obscurity and
Confusion.</p>
            <p>I therefore proceed now to consider what
use your Lordship makes of the Ancients,
against <hi>my way of Certainty in General.</hi> Since
you think fit to make no use of them, as to
<hi>the Certainty of Reason, in making Deductions,</hi>
though it is under this your second Branch
<hi>of Certainty by Reason,</hi> that you bring them
in.</p>
            <p>Your first Objection here,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 120.</note> is that old
one again, That <hi>my way of Certainty by Ideas
is new. Answer.</hi> Your calling of it <hi>New.</hi>
does not prove it to be different from <hi>that
of Reason:</hi> But your Lordship proves it to
be <hi>New</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">ib.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Because here</hi> [i. e. in my way] <hi>we have
no General Principles. Answer.</hi> I do, as
your Lordship knows, own the Truth and
Certainty of the received general Maxim<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and I contend for the Usefulness and Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of self-evident Propositions in all Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
whether of Intuition or Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65912:160"/>
What therefore those <hi>General Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
are, which <hi>you have not</hi> in my way of
Certainty by Ideas, which your Lordship
has in your way of Certainty by Reason, I
beseech you to tell, and thereby to make
good this Assertion against me.</p>
            <p>2. Your Lordship says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 120.</note> That here [i. e.
in my way] <hi>we have no Antecedents and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents,
no syllogistical Methods of Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Answer.</hi> If your Lordship here means,
That there be no <hi>Antecedents and Consequents</hi>
in my Book, or that I speak not, or allow
not of <hi>Syllogism</hi> as a Form of Argumentation,
that has its use, I humbly conceive the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is plain. But if <hi>by here we have no
Antecedents and Consequents, no syllogistical
Methods of Demonstration,</hi> you mean, That
I do not place Certainty, in <hi>having Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and Consequents,</hi> or in making of <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisms,</hi>
I grant I do not; I have said Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisms
instead of your Words, <hi>Syllogistical
Methods of Demonstration;</hi> which examined,
amount here to no more than <hi>Syllogisms:</hi>
For <hi>Syllogistical Methods</hi> are nothing but <hi>mode
&amp; figure,</hi> i. e. <hi>Syllogisms;</hi> and the Rules of
<hi>Syllogisms</hi> are the same, whether the <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisms</hi>
be used in Demonstration or in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability.
But 'twas convenient for you to
say, <hi>Syllogistical Methods of Demonstration,</hi> if
you would have it thought, that Certainty
is placed in it: For to have named bare
<hi>Syllogism,</hi> without annexing <hi>Demonstration</hi> to
it, would have spoiled all, since every one
who knows what Syllogism is, knows it
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:65912:161"/>
may as well be used in Topical or Fallacious
Arguments, as in <hi>Demonstration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship charges me then, That <hi>in
my way by Ideas,</hi> I do not place Certainty,
in having <hi>Antecedents and Consequents.</hi> And
pray, my Lord, do you in your <hi>way by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
do so? If you do, this is certain, That
every body has, or may have <hi>Certainty</hi> in
every thing he disourses about: For every
one, in any Discourse he makes has, or may,
if he pleases, have <hi>Antecedents and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, your Lordship charges me, That I
do not place <hi>Certainty in Syllogism.</hi> I crave
leave to ask again; And does your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?
And is this the difference between
your way of Certainty by Reason, and my
way of Certainty by Ideas? Why else is it
objected to me, That I do not, if your
Lordship does not place <hi>Certainty in Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism?</hi>
And if you do, I know nothing so
requisite, as that you should advise all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Women and all, to betake themselves
immediately to the Universities, and to the
learning of Logick; to put themselves out
of the dangerous State of <hi>Scepticism:</hi> For
there young Lads, by being taught <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism,</hi>
arrive at Certainty; whereas, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Mode and Figure, the World is in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Ignorance and Uncertainty, and is sure
of nothing. The Merchant cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that his Account is right cast up, nor
the Lady that her Coach is not a Wheel-barrow,
nor her Dairy-maid, that one and
one Pound of Butter are two Pounds of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65912:161"/>
Butter, and two and two four; and all
for want of Mode and Figure: Nay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this Rule, whoever lived before
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> or him, whoever it was, that first
introduced <hi>Syllogism,</hi> could not be <hi>certain</hi>
of any thing; no, not that there was a
God, which will be the present State of the
far greatest part of Mankind (to pass by
whole Nations of the East, as <hi>China,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dostan,</hi>
&amp;c.) even in the Christian World,
who to this day have not the <hi>Syllogistical
Methods of Demonstration,</hi> and so cannot be
certain of any thing.</p>
            <p>3. Your Lordship farther says, That in
<hi>my way of Certainty by Ideas we have no Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion.
Answer.</hi> To perceive the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Disagreement of two Ideas, and
not to perceive the Agreement or Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of two Ideas, is, I think, a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion
to distinguish what a Man is <hi>certain</hi>
of, from what he is not <hi>certain</hi> of. Has your
Lordship any other or better <hi>Criterion</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
Certainty from Uncertainty? If
you have, I repeat again my earnest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
That you would be pleased to do that
Right to your <hi>way of Certainty by Reason,</hi>
as not to conceal it. If your Lordship has
not, why is the want of a <hi>Criterion,</hi> when
I have so plain a one, objected to my way
of Certainty, and my way so often accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of a tendency to <hi>Scepticism</hi> and <hi>Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
when you your Self have not a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
And I think I may take the liberty
to say, if yours be not the same, you have
not one so good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:65912:162"/>
Perhaps your Lordship will censure me
here, and think it is more than becomes
me, to press you so hard concerning your
own way; and to ask, whether your way
of Certainty lies in having <hi>Antecedents</hi> and
<hi>Consequents,</hi> and <hi>Syllogisms;</hi> And whether
it has any other or better <hi>Criterion,</hi> than
what I have given: Your Lordship will pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
think it enough, that you have <hi>laid
down the Grounds of Certainty which the ancient</hi>
Grecians <hi>went upon.</hi> My Lord, if you think
so, I must be satisfied with it: Though
perhaps others will think it strange, that
in a Dispute about <hi>a Method of Certainty,</hi>
which for its supposed coming short of
Certainty, you charge with a Tendency to
<hi>Scepticism</hi> and <hi>Infidelity;</hi> you should produce
only the different Opinions of other Men,
concerning Certainty, to make good this
Charge, without declaring any of those dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Opinions or Grounds of Certainty to
be true or false: And some may be apt to
suspect that you your self are not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
wherein to place it.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, I know too well, what
your distance above me requires of me, to
say any such thing to your Lordship. Your
own Opinions are to your self, and your
not discovering them, must pass for a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Reason for your not discovering
them; and if you think fit to Over-lay a
poor Insant modern Notion with the great
and weighty Names of <hi>Pythagoras, Plato,
Aristotle, Plutarch,</hi> and the like; and heaps
of Quotations out of the Ancients, who is
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65912:162"/>
not presently to think it dead, and that
there is an end of it? Especially, when it
will have too much Envy for any one to
open his Mouth in defence of a Notion,
which is declared by your Lordship to be
different, from what those great Men, whose
Words are to be taken without any more
ado, and who are not to be thought Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
or Mistaken in any thing. Though
I crave leave to say, That however infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Oracles they were, to take things
barely upon their, or any Man's Authority,
is barely to believe, but not to know or be
<hi>certain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus your Lordship has sufficiently
proved my <hi>way of Certainty by Ideas</hi> to be
inconsistent with the <hi>way of Certainty by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
by proving it <hi>New;</hi> which you prove
only by saying, That it <hi>is so wholly new,
that here we have no general Principles; no
Criterion; no Antecedents and Consequents;
no Syllogistical Methods of Demonstration: And
yet we are told of a better way of Certainty to
be attained meerly by the help of Ideas;</hi> add
if your Lordship pleases, signified by words,
which put into Propositions, whereof some
are <hi>General Principles,</hi> some are or may be
<hi>Antecedents,</hi> and some <hi>Consequents,</hi> and some
put together in Mode and Figure, <hi>Syllogistical
Methods of Demonstration:</hi> For, pray my
Lord, may not Words that stand for Ideas,
be put into Propositions as well as any
other? And may not those Propositions,
wherein the Terms stand for Ideas, be as
well put into <hi>Antecedents</hi> and <hi>Consequents,</hi> or
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:65912:163"/>
               <hi>Syllogisms,</hi> and make <hi>Maxims</hi> as well as any
other Propositions, whose Terms stand not
for Ideas, if your Lordship can find any
such? And if thus Ideas can be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Maxims, Antecedents and Consequents,</hi> and
<hi>Syllogistical Methods of Demonstration,</hi> what
Inconsistency has the way of Certainty by
Ideas, with those <hi>ways of Certainty by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
if at last your Lordship will say, That
Certainty consists in Propositions put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as <hi>Antecedents and Consequents, and in
Mode and Figure?</hi> For as for <hi>Principles</hi> or
<hi>Maxims,</hi> we shall know whether your <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
or <hi>Maxims</hi> are a way to Certainty,
when you shall please to tell us, what it is,
that to your Lordship, makes a <hi>Maxim</hi> or
<hi>Principle,</hi> and distinguishes it from other
Propositions; and whether it be any thing
but an immediate Perception of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Disagreement of the Ideas, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in that Proposition. To conclude,
by all that your Lordship has alledged out
of the Ancients, you have not, as I humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceive, proved that my way of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
is new, or that they had any way
of Certainty different from mine; much
less have you proved that my way of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
by Ideas is <hi>inconsistent with the way of
Certainty by Reason,</hi> which was the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to be proved.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship having thought it enough
against my way of Certainty by Ideas, thus
to prove its <hi>Newness,</hi> you betake your self
presently to your old Topick of <hi>obscure and
confused Ideas:</hi> And asks,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 120.</note> 
               <hi>But how comes
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:65912:163"/>
there to be such a way of Certainty by Ideas,
and yet the Ideas themselves are so uncertain
and obscure? Answer.</hi> No Idea, as it is in
the Mind, is <hi>uncertain;</hi> though to those
who use Names uncertainly, it may be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain</hi>
what Idea that Name stands for.
And as to obscure and confused Ideas, no
Idea is so obscure in all its parts or so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with all other Ideas but that one,
who in a Proposition, joins it with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in that part which is clear and distinct,
may perceive its Agreement or Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as expressed in that Proposition:
Though when Names are used for Ideas,
which are in some part obscure or confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Ideas, there can be no Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
made which can produce Certainty
concerning that, wherein the Idea is obscure
and confused. And therefore to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Question,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 122.</note> 
               <hi>How is it possible for us
to have a clear Perception of the Agreement of
Ideas, if the Ideas themselves be not clear and
distinct?</hi> I answer, Very well; because <hi>an
obscure or confused Idea,</hi> i. e. that is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
clear and distinct in all its parts, may
be compared with another in that part of
it, which is clear and distinct; which will,
I humbly conceive, remove all those Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
Inconsistencies and Contradictions,
which your Lordship seems to be troubled
with, from my Words quoted in those two
Pages.<note n="*" place="margin">p. 121, 122.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship having, as it seems, quite
forgot that you were to shew wherein
the <hi>Certainty of Deductions, in the way of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:65912:164"/>
Ideas,</hi> was inconsistent with the Certainty
of Deductions, <hi>in the way of Reason,</hi> brings
here<note n="†" place="margin">p. 122.</note> 
               <hi>a new Charge upon my way of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi>
viz. <hi>That I have no Criterion to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
false and doubtful Ideas, from true
and certain.</hi> Your Lordship says<note n="*" place="margin">p. 123.</note> the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicks</hi>
went upon <hi>Ideas,</hi> or <hi>Representations
of things to their Minds;</hi> and pray, my Lord,
does not your Lordship do so too? Or has
Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> so won upon your Lordship, by
his <hi>solid Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy against the Fancies of the
Ideists,</hi> that you <hi>begin to think him in the right</hi>
in this too;<note place="margin">Solid Philosophy, p. 24, &amp; 27.</note> where he says, <hi>That Notions
are the Materials of our Knowledge;</hi> and <hi>that
a Notion is the very thing it self Existing in
the Vnderstanding?</hi> For since I make no
doubut, but that, in all your Lordship's
Knowledge, you will allow, that you have
some immediate Objects of your Thoughts,
which are the Materials of that Knowledge,
about which it is employed, those immediate
Objects, if they are not as Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> says,
the <hi>very things themselves,</hi> must be <hi>Ideas.</hi>
Not thinking your Lordship therefore yet
so perfect a Convert of Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi>'s, that
you are perswaded, that as often as you
think of your Cathedral Church, or of <hi>Des
Cartes</hi>'s Vortices, that the very Cathedral
Church at <hi>Worcester,</hi> or the Motion of those
Vortices, <hi>it self Exists</hi> in your Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when one of them never existed but
in that one place at <hi>Worcester,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
never existed any where in <hi>rerum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura.</hi>
I conclude, your Lordship has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Objects of your Mind, which are
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:65912:164"/>
not <hi>the very things themselves Existing in your
Understanding;</hi> which if with the <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks</hi>
you will please to call <hi>Representations,</hi>
as I suppose you will, rather than with me
<hi>Ideas,</hi> it will make no difference.</p>
            <p>This being so, I must then make the same
Objection against your <hi>way of Certainty by
Reason,</hi> that your Lordship does against <hi>my
way of Certainty by Ideas</hi> (for upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of these two we now are) and then
I return your Words here<note n="*" place="margin">p. 122, 123.</note> again, viz.
That <hi>you have no Criterion to distinguish false
and doubtful Representations, from true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
How then can any Man be secure, that
he is not imposed upon in your Lordship's way of
Representations?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 124, 125.</note> 
               <hi>I tell you of a way
of Certainty by Ideas, and never offer any such
Method for examining them as the Academicks
required for their Probability. Answer.</hi> I was
not, I confess, so well acquainted with
what the <hi>Academicks went upon</hi> for the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion</hi>
of <hi>a greater Probability,</hi> as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is; or if I had, I writing, as your
Lordship knows, <hi>out of my own Thoughts,</hi>
could not well transcribe out of them. But
that you should tell me, I never offer any
<hi>Criterion</hi> to distinguish false from true Ideas,
I cannot but wonder; and therefore crave
leave to beg your Lordship to look again
into B. 2. C. 32. of my <hi>Essay;</hi> and there, I
perswade my self, you will find a <hi>Criterion,</hi>
whereby true and false Ideas may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:65912:165"/>
Your Lordship brings for Instance<note n="*" place="margin">p. 125.</note> the
Idea of <hi>Solidity;</hi> but what it is an Instance
of, I confess, I do not see: <hi>Your Lordship
charges</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 122.</note> 
               <hi>on my way of Certainty, that I have
no Criterion to distinguish false and doubtful
Ideas from true and certain;</hi> which is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 123 &amp; 124.</note> by an account you give, how the
Academicks <hi>examined their Ideas or Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
before they allowed them to prevail on
them to give an Assent, as to a greater Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi>
And then you tell me,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 125.</note> That <hi>I
never offer any such Method for examining them,
as the Academicks required for their Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi>
to which your Lordship subjoins these
Words, <hi>As for Instance my first Idea, which
I go upon of Solidity.</hi> Would not one now
expect, that this should be an Instance to
make good your Lordship's Charge, That
I had no <hi>Criterion</hi> to distinguish, whether
my Idea of Solidity were false and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
or true and certain.</p>
            <p>To shew that I have no such Criterion,
your Lordship asks me two Questions, the
first<note n="*" place="margin">p. 125.</note> is, <hi>How my Idea of Solidity comes to
be clear and distinct?</hi> I will suppose for once,
that I know not <hi>how it comes to be clear and
distinct:</hi> How will this prove, That I have
no <hi>Criterion</hi> to know whether it be <hi>true or
false?</hi> For the Question here is not about
knowing <hi>how an Idea comes to be clear and
distinct;</hi> but how I shall know whether it
be <hi>true or false.</hi> But your Lordship's fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Words seem to aim at a farther
Objection; your Words altogether are,
<hi>How this Idea [i. e.</hi> my Idea of Solidity,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:65912:165"/>
which consists in Repletion of Space, with
an exclusion of all other solid Substances]
<hi>comes to be clear and distinct to me, when
others who go in the same way of Ideas, have
quite an other Idea of it?</hi> My Lord, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
your Lordship to name who those
<hi>Others</hi> are, who <hi>go in the same way of Ideas
with me,</hi> who <hi>have quite another Idea of <hi>this
my Idea</hi>
               </hi> than I have; for to <hi>this Idea</hi> I
could be sure that <hi>It,</hi> in any other Writer
but your Lordship must here refer: But
my Lord, it is one of your priviledged Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
and I have nothing to say to it. But
let it be so, that <hi>others have quite an other
Idea of it</hi> than I; How does that prove,
That I have no <hi>Criterion</hi> to distinguish whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>my Idea of Solidity</hi> be true or no?</p>
            <p>Your Lordship farther adds,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 125.</note> That those
<hi>Others think that they have as plain and distinct
an Idea that Extension and Body are the same:</hi>
And then your Lordship asks, <hi>Now what
Criterion is there to come to a Certainty in <hi>this</hi>
Matter? Answer.</hi> In what Matter, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
your Lordship, if it be whether my
Idea of Solidity be a <hi>true</hi> Idea, which is
the Matter here in Question? In <hi>this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
I have given a <hi>Criterion</hi> to know, in my
<hi>Essay,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">B. 2. C. 32.</note> if it be to decide the Question,
whether the Word Body more properly
stands for the simple Idea of <hi>Space</hi> or for
the Complex Idea of <hi>Space</hi> and <hi>Solidity</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
that is not the Question here, nor
can there be any other <hi>Criterion</hi> to decide it
by, but the Propriety of our Language.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:65912:166"/>
But your Lordship adds,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 126.</note> 
               <hi>Ideas can have
no way of Certainty in themselves, if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for even Philosophical and Rational Men
to fall into such contrary Ideas about the same
thing;</hi> and both sides <hi>think their Ideas to be
clear and distinct.</hi> If this were so, I do not
see how this would any way prove, That I
had no <hi>Criterion</hi> whereby it might be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
whether my Idea of Solidity were
true or no, which was to be proved.</p>
            <p>But at last, this which your Lordship calls
<hi>contrary Ideas about the same thing,</hi> is nothing
but a difference about a Name. For I think
no body will say, That the Idea of Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and the Idea of Solidity are the same
Ideas: All the difference then between <hi>those
Philosophical and Rational Men,</hi> which your
Lordship mentions here, is no more but
this, whether the Simple Idea of pure Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
shall be called <hi>Body,</hi> or whether the
Complex Ideas of Extension and Solidity
joined together, shall be called <hi>Body;</hi> which
will be no more than a bare verbal Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to any one, who does not take Sounds
for Things, and make the Word <hi>Body</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than a Sign of what the Speaker
would signifie by it. But what the Speaker
makes the Term <hi>Body</hi> stand for, cannot be
precisely known till he has determined it in
his own Mind, and made it known to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and then there can between them be
no longer a dispute about the Signification
of the Word, <hi>v. g.</hi> If one of those <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Rational Men</hi> tells your Lordship,
That he makes the Term <hi>Body</hi> to stand
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:65912:166"/>
precisely for the simple Idea of pure Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension,
your Lordship or he can be in no
doubt or uncertainty concerning this thing;
but whenever he uses the Word <hi>Body,</hi> your
Lordship must suppose in his Mind the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Idea of Extension, as the thing he means
by <hi>Body.</hi> If on the other side another of
those <hi>Philosophical Rational Men</hi> shall tell
your Lordship, That he makes the Term
<hi>Body</hi> to stand precisely for a Complex Idea
made up of the simple Ideas of <hi>Extension</hi> and
<hi>Solidity</hi> joyned together; your Lordship or
he, can be in no doubt or uncertainty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Thing: But whenever he uses
the word Body, your Lordship must Think
on, and allow the Idea belonging to it, to
be that Complex one.</p>
            <p>As your Lordship can allow this different
use of the term Body in these different Men,
without changing any Idea, or any thing
in your own Mind, but the application of
the same Term to different Ideas, which
changes neither the <hi>Truth</hi> nor <hi>Certainty</hi> of
any of your Lordship's <hi>Ideas,</hi> from what it
was before: So those Two <hi>Philosophical ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Men,</hi> may, in Discourse one with
another, agree to use that term <hi>Body,</hi> for
either of those two Ideas, which they please,
without at all making their <hi>Ideas,</hi> on either
side, <hi>false or uncertain.</hi> But if they will
contest which of these Ideas the sound <hi>Body</hi>
ought to stand for, 'tis visible their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is not about any reality of Things;
but the propriety of Speech, and their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:65912:167"/>
pute and doubt is only about the signification
of a Word.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's second Question<note n="*" place="margin">p. 126.</note> is,
<hi>Whether by this Idea of Solidity, we may come
to know, what it is. Answ.</hi> I must ask you
here again, what you mean by it? If your
Lordship by it means <hi>Solidity,</hi> then your
Question runs thus: Whether by this [<hi>i. e.</hi>
my] <hi>Idea of Solidity, we may come to know
what Solidity is? Answ.</hi> Without doubt, if
your Lordship means by the term <hi>Solidity,</hi>
what I mean by the term <hi>Solidity;</hi> for then
I have told you what <hi>it is</hi> in the Chapter
above cited by your Lordship:<note place="margin">B. 2. C. 4.</note> If you mean
any thing else by the term <hi>Solidity,</hi> when
your Lordship will please to tell me what
you mean by it, I will tell your Lordship
what <hi>Solidity</hi> is. This, I humbly conceive,
you will find your self obliged to do, if
what I have said of Solidity, does not satisfie
you <hi>what it is.</hi> For you will not think it
reasonable, I should tell your Lordship what
a thing is when expressed by you in a Term,
which I do not know what your Lordship
means by, nor what you make it stand
for.</p>
            <p>But your Lordship asks,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 126.</note> 
               <hi>wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists;</hi>
if you mean wherein the Idea of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists,
that I have already told your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
in the Chapter of my Essay above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.
If your Lordship means what
is the real internal Constitution, that phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically
makes <hi>Solidity</hi> in Things. If I answer
I do not know, that will no more make my
Idea of <hi>Solidity</hi> not to be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>certain</hi> (if
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:65912:167"/>
your Lordship thinks Certainty may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to single Ideas) than the not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the physical Constitution, whereby the
parts of Bodies are so framed as to cohere,
makes my Idea of Cohesion not <hi>true</hi> or <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To my saying in my Essay,<note n="*" place="margin">B. 2. C. 4. § 6.</note> 
               <q>That
if any one ask me what this Solidity is,
I send him to his Senses to inform him.</q>
Your Lordship replies,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 126.</note> 
               <hi>You thought the
Design of my Book would have sent him to his
Ideas for Certainty; and are we,</hi> says your
Lordship, <hi>sent back again from our Ideas to
our Senses? Answ.</hi> I cannot help it, if your
Lordship mistakes the <hi>Design of my Book:</hi> For
what concerns <hi>Certainty,</hi> i. e. the Knowledge
of the Truth of Propositions, my Book
sends every one to his <hi>Ideas:</hi> But for the
getting of simple Ideas of Sensation, my Book
sends him only to his Senses. But your
Lordship uses <hi>Certainty</hi> here, in a Sense I
never used it, nor do understand it in; for
what the <hi>Certainty</hi> of any simple Idea is,
I confess I do not know; and shall be glad
you would tell me, what you mean by it.</p>
            <p>However, in this Sense you ask me,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 127.</note>
and that as if your Question carried a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of my Contradicting my self.
<hi>And are we sent back again, from our Ideas to
our Senses? Answ.</hi> My Lord, every one is
sent to his Senses to get the simple Ideas of
Sensation, because they are no other way to
be got.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship presses on with this far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Question,<note n="*" place="margin">ibid.</note> 
               <hi>What do these Ideas signify
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:65912:168"/>
then? i. e.</hi> if a Man be sent to his Senses
for the Idea of Solidity? I Answer, to shew
him the Certainty of Propositions, wherein
the Agreement or Disagreement of Ideas
is perceived, which is the Certainty I speak
of, and no other: But what the Certainty
is, which your Lordship speaks of in this
and the following Page,<note n="*" place="margin">127. 128.</note> I confess I do not
understand. For,</p>
            <p>Your Lordship adds,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 127.</note> that <hi>I say farther,</hi>
               <q>That if this be not a sufficient Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Solidity, I promise to tell any
one what it is, when he tells me, what
Thinking is; or explains to me, what
Extension and Motion are.</q> 
               <hi>Are we not
now in the true way to Certainty, when such
Things as these are given over, of which we
have the clearest Evidence by Sensation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection?
For here I make it as impossible to come
to certain, clear and distinct Notions of these
Things,</hi> as to discourse into a Blind Man,
the Ideas of Light and Colours. <hi>Is not this a
rare way of Certainty? Answ.</hi> What <hi>Things,</hi>
my Lord, I beseech you, are <hi>those</hi> which
you here tell me, <hi>are given over,</hi> of which
<hi>we have the clearest Evidence by Sensation or
Reflection?</hi> 'Tis likely you will tell me they
are <hi>Extension</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi> But, my Lord,
I crave the liberty to say, That when you
have consider'd again, you will be satisfied,
there are no <hi>Things given over</hi> in the Case,
but only the Names <hi>Extension</hi> and <hi>Motion;</hi>
and concerning them too, nothing is <hi>given
over,</hi> but a power of defining them. When
you will be pleased to lay by a little the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:65912:168"/>
Warmth of those Questions of Triumph,
which I meet with in this Passage, and tell
me what <hi>Things</hi> your Lordship makes these
Names <hi>Extension</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> to stand for,
you perhaps will not find, that <hi>I make it
impossible</hi> for those, who have their Senses,
to get the simple Ideas, signified by these
Names, very clear and distinct by their
Senses: Though I do say, that these, as well
as all other Names of simple Ideas, cannot
be defined; nor any simple Ideas be brought
into our Minds by Words, any more, than
the Ideas of Light and Colours can be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
into a Blind Man, which is all I
do say in those Words of mine, which your
Lordship quotes, as such, wherein I have
<hi>given over Things, whereof we have the clearest
Evidence:</hi> And so from my being of Opinion,
That the Names of simple Ideas cannot be
defined, nor those Ideas got by any Words
whatsoever, which is all that I there say.
Your Lordship very pathetically expresses
your self, as if in <hi>my way,</hi> all were gone;
Certainty were lost; and if my Method
should be allowed, there is an end of all
Knowledge in the World.</p>
            <p>The Reason your Lordship gives<note n="*" place="margin">p. 127.</note> against
my way of Certainty is, That <hi>I here make
it as impossible to come to certain clear and distinct
Notions of these Things [i. e.</hi> Extension and
Motion] <hi>as to discourse into a Blind Man the
Idea of Light and Colours. Answ.</hi> What
<hi>clear and distinct</hi> Notions or Ideas are, I do
understand: But what your Lordship means
by <hi>certain Notions,</hi> speaking here, as you
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:65912:169"/>
do, of simple Ideas, I must own, I do not
understand. That for the attaining those
simple Ideas I <hi>send Men to their Senses,</hi> I
shall think I am in the right, till I hear
from your Lordship better Arguments to
convince me of my Mistake, than these.<note n="†" place="margin">p. 127.</note>
               <hi>Are we not now in the true way to Certainty?
Is not this a rare way of Certainty?</hi> And if
your Lordship has a better way to get clear
and distinct simple Ideas, than by the Senses,
you will oblige me, and I think the World
too, by a Discovery of it. Till then, I
shall continue in the same Mind I was of,
when I writ that Passage,<note n="*" place="margin">Essay B. 2. C. 4. § 5 &amp; 6.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That
Words can do nothing towards it, and that
for the Reason, which I there promised,
and is to be found, <hi>Essay</hi> B. 3. C. 4. § 7. &amp;c.
And therefore to your Lordship's saying,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 127.</note>
That <hi>thus you have shewed, that I have no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
against false and uncertain Ideas, no Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion
to judge them by,</hi> I think I may securely
Reply, that with Submission, <hi>thus shewing</hi> it,
is no shewing it at all; nor will ever shew,
That I have no such <hi>Criterion,</hi> even when
we shall add your Lordship's <hi>farther</hi> Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 128.</note> 
               <hi>Now here again our Ideas deceive us.</hi>
Which supposing it a good Inference from
these Words of mine, <q>That most of our
simple Ideas are not the likenesses of
Things without us,</q> yet it seems to me,
to come in here, a little out of Season:
Because the Proposition to be proved is, as
I humbly conceive, not that <hi>our Ideas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us,</hi> but that <hi>I have not a Criterion to
distinguish true from false Ideas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:65912:169"/>
If it be brought to prove, that I have no
<hi>Criterion,</hi> I have this to say, That I neither
well understand, what it is for our <hi>Ideas to
deceive us in the way of Certainty:</hi> Nor, in
the best Sense, that I can give it, do I see
how it proves, that I have no <hi>Criterion;</hi>
nor lastly, how it follows from my saying,
that most of our simple Ideas are not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship seems by the following
Words<note n="*" place="margin">p. 128.</note> to mean, That in this way by Ideas,
which are confessed not to be Resemblances,
Men are hindred, and cannot go far in the
Knowledge of what <hi>they desire to know of the
Nature of those Objects, of which we have the
Ideas in our Minds.</hi> If this should be so,
what is this I beseech your Lordship to your
shewing that I have no <hi>Criterion?</hi> But that
this is a Fault in the way by Ideas, I shall
be convinced, when your Lordship shall be
pleased to shew me, how in <hi>your way of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
by Reason,</hi> we can know more of the
<hi>Nature of Things without us;</hi> or <hi>of that which
causes these Ideas or Perceptions in us?</hi> But,
I humbly conceive, 'tis no Objection to the
<hi>way of Ideas,</hi> if any one will <hi>deceive himself,</hi>
and expect Certainty by Ideas, in things
where Certainty is not to be had; because
he is told how Knowledge or Certainty is
got by Ideas, as far as Men attain to it.
And since your Lordship is here comparing
the ways of Certainty by <hi>Ideas</hi> and by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
as two different and incosistent ways,
I humbly crave leave to add, That when
you can shew me any one Proposition, which
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:65912:170"/>
you have attained to a Certainty of, in
<hi>your way of Certainty by Reason,</hi> which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
attain to a Certainty of in my <hi>way of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
by Ideas,</hi> I will acknowledge my <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi>
to be guilty of whatever your Lordship
pleases.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship concludes.<note n="*" place="margin">p. 128.</note> 
               <hi>So that these
Ideas are really nothing but Names, if they
be not Representations. Answ.</hi> This does not
yet <hi>shew,</hi> that I have no <hi>Criterion to distinguish
true from false Ideas,</hi> the thing that your
Lordship is <hi>thus shewing.</hi> For I may have a
<hi>Criterion</hi> to distinguish true from false <hi>Ideas,</hi>
though that <hi>Criterion</hi> concern not <hi>Names</hi> at
all. For your Lordship in this Proposition,
allowing none to be <hi>Ideas,</hi> but what are
<hi>Representations;</hi> the other, which you say,
are <hi>nothing but Names,</hi> are not concerned in
the Criterion, that is, to distinguish true
from false <hi>Ideas:</hi> Because it relates to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Ideas,</hi> and the distinguishing of
them one from another: Unless <hi>true and
false Ideas</hi> can be any thing but <hi>Ideas,</hi> i. e.
<hi>Ideas</hi> and not <hi>Ideas</hi> at the same time.</p>
            <p>But farther, I crave leave to Answer,
That your Lordship's Proposition, <hi>viz. That
these Ideas are really nothing but Names, if
they be not the representations of Things:</hi> Seems
to me no Consequence from my Words, to
which it is subjoyned, though introduced
with <hi>so that:</hi> For methinks it carries some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like a Contradiction in it, I say,
<q>Most of our simple Ideas of Sensation,
are not the likeness of something with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us.</q> Your Lordship infers, if so,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:65912:170"/>
               <hi>these Ideas are really nothing but Names;</hi> which,
as it seems to me, is as much as to say,
<hi>These Ideas,</hi> that are Ideas, are not Ideas,
<hi>but Names</hi> only. Methinks they might be
allowed to be <hi>Ideas,</hi> and that is all they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be, though they do not resemble
that which produces them. I cannot help
thinking a Son something really more than
a bare <hi>Name,</hi> though he has not the luck to
resemble his Father, who begot him: And
the Black and Blue which I see, I cannot
conclude but to be something besides the
Words <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>Blue</hi> (wherever your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
shall place that something, either in my
Perception only, or in my Skin) though it
resemble not at all the Stone, that with a
knock produced it.</p>
            <p>Should your Lordship put your two
Hands, whereof one is Hot and the other
Cold, into Luke-warm Water; It would
be hard to think, That the Idea of Heat
produced in you by one of your Hands; and
the Idea of Cold by the other, were the
likenesses and very resemblances of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the same Water: Since the same
Water could not be capable of having at the
same time such real Contrarieties. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
since, as 'tis evident, they cannot be
representations of any Thing in the Water,
it follows by your Lordship's Doctrin here,
That if you should declare what you feel, <hi>viz.</hi>
That you feel <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi> in that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>viz.</hi> Heat by one Hand, and Cold by
the other, you mean nothing by <hi>Heat</hi> and
<hi>Cold; Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi> in the Case are nothing
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:65912:171"/>
but Names; and your Lordship in Truth,
feels nothing but these two Names.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship in the next place<note n="*" place="margin">p. 129.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to <hi>examine my way of Demonstration.</hi>
Whether you do this to <hi>shew,</hi> That I have
no <hi>Criterion,</hi> whereby to distinguish true
from false Ideas; or to shew, That <hi>my way
of Certainty by Ideas, is inconsistent with the
Certainty of Deductions by Reason;</hi> for these
were the Things you seemed to me to have
undertaken to <hi>shew,</hi> and therefore to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this place, does not appear: But this
appears by the Words wherewith you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 129.</note> this Examen, that it is to avoid
<hi>doing me Wrong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship, as if you had been sensible,
that your former Discourse had led you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
doing me Wrong, breaks it off of a
suddain, and begins this new one of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
by telling me, <hi>you will do me no
Wrong.</hi> Can it be thought now, that you
forget this Promise, before you get half
through your Examen? Or is a mis-citing
my Words, and misrepresenting my Sense
no Wrong? Your Lordship in this very
Examen, sets down a long Quotation out
of my <hi>Essay,</hi> and in the close you tell me.
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 133.</note> 
               <hi>These are my own Words which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
has set down at large, that I may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that you misrepresent my Sense.</hi> This
one would think Guaranty enough in a less
Man than your Lordship: And yet, my
Lord, I must crave leave to complain, that
not only my Sense, but my very Words are
in that Quotation <hi>misrepresented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:65912:171"/>
To shew that my Complaint is not
groundless, give me leave, my Lord, to
set down my Words as I read them in that
place of my Book<note n="†" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 7. Sect. 10.</note> which your Lordship

            <p>By their standing thus together, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will without any pains see whether
those your Lordship has set down in your
Letter are <hi>my own Words;</hi> and whether
in that place, which speaks only of <hi>self-evident
Propositions</hi> or <hi>Principles,</hi> I have
any thing in Words or in Sense like this,
<hi>That our <hi>particular distinct Ideas</hi> are known
by their Native Evidence,</hi> &amp;c. Though your
Lordship closes the Quotation with that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Declaration above mention'd, <hi>That
they are my own Words, which you have set
down at large that I may not complain you
misrepresent my Sense.</hi> And yet nothing can
more misrepresent my Sense than they do,
applying all that to <hi>particular Ideas,</hi> which
I speak there only of <hi>self-evident Propositions</hi>
or <hi>Principles;</hi> and that so plainly, that I
think, I may venture any one's mistaking
it in my own Words: And upon this Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representation
of my Sense, your Lordship
raises a Discourse, and manages a Dispute
for, I think, a dozen Pages<note n="*" place="margin">133-146.</note> following,
against my <hi>placing Demonstration on self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Ideas;</hi> though <hi>self-evident Ideas</hi> are
things wholly unknown to me, and are no
where in my Book, nor were ever in my
Thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:65912:172"/>
But let us come to your Exceptions against
my way of <hi>Demonstration,</hi> which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is pleased to call<note n="†" place="margin">p. 129.</note> 
               <hi>Demonstration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Principles. Answer.</hi> If you mean by <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
self-evident Propositions, then you
know my Demonstration is not without
<hi>Principles,</hi> in that Sense of the Term <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:</hi>
For your Lordship in the next Page
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 130.</note> blames my way, because I suppose every
intermediate Idea in Demonstration to have
a <hi>self-evident Connection</hi> with the other Idea;
for two such Ideas as have a <hi>self-evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection,</hi>
joined together in a Proposition,
make a <hi>self-evident Proposition.</hi> If your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
means by <hi>Principles,</hi> those which in the
place<note n="†" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 2. Sect. 8.</note> there quoted by your Lordship; I
mean, viz. <hi>Whatever is, is;</hi> and <hi>it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for the same thing to be and not to
be;</hi> and such other general Propositions, as
are received under the Name of <hi>Maxims;</hi>
I grant, that I do say, That they are not
absolutely requisite in every <hi>Demonstration:</hi>
And I think, I have shewn, That there be
Demonstrations, which may be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them; though I do not, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
say, That they are excluded, and
cannot be made use of in Demonstration.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's first Argument<note n="*" place="margin">p. 129.</note> against
my way of Demonstration is, <hi>That it must
suppose self-evidence must be in the Ideas of
my Mind; and that every intermediate Idea,
which I take to demonstrate any thing by, must
have a self-evident Connection with the others.
Answer.</hi> Taking <hi>self-evidence in the Ideas of
the Mind,</hi> to mean in the perceived Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:65912:173"/>
or Disagreement of Ideas in the Mind;
I grant, I do not only suppose, but say so.</p>
            <p>To prove it not to be so in <hi>Demonstration,</hi>
your Lordship says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 130.</note> 
               <hi>That it is such a way
of Demonstration, as the old Philosophers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thought of. Answer.</hi> No body, I think,
will question, that your Lordship is very
well read in the old Philosophers: But he
that will answer for what <hi>the old Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
ever did, <hi>or did not think of,</hi> must not
only understand their extant Writings bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than any Man ever did; but must have
ways to know their Thoughts, that other
Men have not. For all of them thought
more than they writ; some of them writ
not at all, and others writ a great deal
more than ever came to us. But if it should
happen that any of them placed the Proof
of any Proposition in the Agreement of
two things in a third, as I think some of
them did, than it will, I humbly conceive
appear, that they did think of my way of
Demonstration; unless your Lordship can
shew, that they could see that two things
agreed in a third, without perceiving their
Agreement with that third; and if they did
in every Syllogism of a Demonstration per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that Agreement, then there was a <hi>self-evident
Connection,</hi> which is that which your
Lordship says <hi>they never thought of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But supposing <hi>they never thought of it,</hi> must
we put out our Eyes, and not see whatever
they overlooked? Are all the Discoveries
made by <hi>Galileo,</hi> my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Newton,</hi> &amp;c. to be rejected as false,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:65912:173"/>
because they teach us what <hi>the old Philosophers
never thought of?</hi> Mistake me not, my Lord,
in thinking that I have the vanity here
to rank my self, on this Occasion, with these
great discoverers of Truth, and advancers
of Knowledge. On the contrary, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that my way of Certainty, my way
of Demonstration, which your Lordship so
often condemns for its newness, is not
<hi>New;</hi> but is the very same that has always
been used, both by Ancients and Moderns:
I am only considering here your Lordship's
Argument, of <hi>never having been thought of
by the old Philosophers;</hi> which is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that will make nothing for or against
the Truth of any Proposition advanced by
a Modern Writer, till your Lordship has
proved, that those old Philosophers (let the
happy Age of old Philosophers determine
where your Lordship pleases) did discover
all Truth, or that they had the sole Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to search after it, and besides them
no body was to study Nature, no body was
to Think or Reason for himself; but every
one was to be barely a reading Philosopher,
with an implicit Faith.</p>
            <p>Your Objection in the next Words,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 130.</note>
That <hi>then every Demonstration</hi> carries <hi>its own
Light with it,</hi> shews that your <hi>way by Reason</hi>
is what I do not understand. For this I
thought heretofore, was the property of
<hi>Demonstration,</hi> and not a Proof that it was
not a Demonstration, <hi>that it carried its own
Light with it:</hi> But yet though in every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
there is a <hi>self-evident Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:65912:174"/>
of the Ideas, by which it is made; yet
that it does not follow from thence, as your
Lordship here objects, that then every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
would be as clear and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
as that <hi>two and two make four,</hi> your
Lordship may see in the same Chapter,<note n="†" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 2. § 4, 5, 6.</note>
and the reason of it.</p>
            <p>You seem in the following Words to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that there is such a Connection of the
<hi>intermediate Ideas in Mathematical Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
But say,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 130.</note> 
               <hi>You should be glad to see any
Demonstration (not about Figures and Numbers)
of this kind.</hi> And if that be a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against it, I crave leave to use it too
on my side; and to say, <hi>That I would be glad
to see any Demonstration (not about Figures and
Numbers</hi>) not <hi>of this kind,</hi> i. e. wherein there
is not a self-evident Connection of all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate
Ideas. If you have any such, I
earnestly beg your Lordship to favour me
with it; for I crave liberty to say, That
the Reason, and Form, and Way of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
in <hi>Demonstration,</hi> where-ever there is
<hi>Demonstration,</hi> is always the same.</p>
            <p>But you say,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 130.</note> This <hi>is a quite different Case
from mine:</hi> I suppose your Lordship means by
<hi>this, <hi>Mathematical Demonstration,</hi>
               </hi> the thing
mention'd in the preceding Period. And then
your Sense will run thus, <hi>Mathematical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations,</hi>
wherein Certainty is to be had by
the intuition of the self-evident Connection
of all the intermediate Ideas, are <hi>different from</hi>
that Demonstration which I am there treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of. If you mean not so, I must own, I
know not what you mean by saying, This <hi>is
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:65912:174"/>
a quite different Case from mine.</hi> And if your
Lordship does mean so, I do not see how it
can be so as you say, your Words taken all
together run thus,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 130.</note> 
               <hi>My principal Ground is
from Mathematical Demonstrations, and my
Examples are brought from them. But <hi>this</hi> is
quite a different Case from mine,</hi> i. e. I am
speaking in that Chapter of my <hi>Essay</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Demonstration in general, and the
Certainty we have by it: The Examples I
use are brought from Mathematicks, and yet
you say, <hi>Mathematical Demonstrations are
quite a different Case from mine.</hi> If I here
misunderstand your Lordship's This, I must
beg your pardon for it; it is one of your
priviledg'd <hi>Particles,</hi> and I am not Master
of it. Misrepresent your Sense I cannot,
for your very Words are set down, and
let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>But your Lordship gives a Reason for
what you had said in these Words subjoined,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 130.</note> where you say, I <hi>grant that those Ideas on
which Mathematical Demonstrations proceed are
wholly in the Mind, and do not relate to the
Existence of things; but our Debate goes upon
a Certainty of Knowledge of things as really Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.</hi>
In which Words there are these
things remarkable.</p>
            <p>1. That your Lordship's Exception here
is against what I have said concerning De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
in my <hi>Essay,</hi> and not against
any thing I have said in either of my Letters
to your Lordship. If therefore your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and I have, since in our Letters, had
any <hi>Debate</hi> about <hi>the Certainty of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:65912:175"/>
of things as really Existing,</hi> that which
was writ before that <hi>Debate,</hi> could
have no relation to it, nor be limitted by
it. If therefore your Lordship makes any
Exception (as you do) to my way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
as proposed in my <hi>Essay,</hi> you
must, as I humbly conceive, take it as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
there, comprehending Mathematical
Demonstrations, which cannot be exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
because your Lordship says, <hi>our Debate</hi>
now <hi>goes upon a Certainty of the Knowledge
of things as really Existing,</hi> supposing <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Demonstrations,</hi> did not afford <hi>a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Knowledge of things as really Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But in the next place, <hi>Mathematical
Demonstrations</hi> do afford a Certainty of the
Knowledge of things as really Existing, as
much as any other Demonstrations whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
and therefore they afford your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
no Ground upon that account to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them, as you do here, from Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
in other Subjects.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship indeed thinks I have given
you sufficient Grounds to charge me with
the contrary: For you say,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 130.</note> 
               <hi>I grant that
those Ideas on which Mathematical Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
proceed</hi> are <hi>wholly in the Mind;</hi> this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I grant, <hi>and do not relate to the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of things;</hi> but these later Words I do
not remember, that I any where say. And
I wish you had quoted the place where I
<hi>grant</hi> any such thing; I am sure it is not
in that place, where it is likeliest to be
found, I mean where I examine, whether
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:65912:175"/>
the Knowledge we have of <hi>Mathematical
Truths,</hi> be the <hi>Knowledge of Things as really
Existing:</hi> There,<note n="†" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 4. § 6.</note> I say (and I think I
have proved) that it is, though it consists
in the Perception of the Agreement or Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Ideas, that are only in the
Mind: Because it takes in all those things
really existing, which answer those Ideas.
Upon which Ground it was, That I there<note n="*" place="margin">§ 7.</note>
affirmed moral Knowledge, also capable of
Certainty. And pray, my Lord, What
other way can your Lordship proceed, in
any Demonstration you would make, about
any other thing but <hi>Figures and Numbers,</hi>
but the same that you do in <hi>Demonstrations
about Figures and Numbers?</hi> If you would
demonstrate any thing concerning <hi>Man</hi> or
<hi>Murder,</hi> must you not first settle in your
Mind the Idea or Notion you have of that
Animal or that Action, and then shew what
you would demonstrate necessarily to belong
to that Idea in your Mind, and to things
existing only as they correspond with, and
answer that Idea in your Mind? How else
you can make any general Proposition, that
shall contain the knowledge of things as
really existing, I that am Ignorant, should
be glad to learn, when your Lordship shall
do me the Favour to shew me any such.</p>
            <p>In the mean time there is no reason why
you should except <hi>Demonstrations about Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and Numbers,</hi> from Demonstrations
about other Subjects, upon the account that
<hi>I grant, that those Ideas on which Mathematical
Demonstrations proceed, are wholly in the Mind,</hi>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:65912:176"/>
when I say the same of all other Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For the Ideas that other Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
proceed on, are wholly in the Mind:
And no Demonstration whatsoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
Things as really existing any farther,
than as they correspond with, and answer
those <hi>Ideas in the Mind,</hi> which the <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
proceeds on.</hi> This distinction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
here of your Lordship's, between <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical</hi>
and other <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> having
no Foundation, your Inference founded on
it falls with it, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 131.</note> 
               <hi>So that although we
should grant all, that I say about the Intuition
of Ideas in Mathematical Demonstrations, yet
it comes not at all to my Business, unless I can
prove, that we have as clear and distinct Ideas
of Beings, as we have of Numbers and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</hi>
Though how <hi>Beings</hi> here and <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and Figures</hi> come to be opposed against
one another, I shall not be able to conceive,
till I am better instructed, than hitherto I
am, that <hi>Numbers and Figures</hi> are no <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi>
And that the Mathematicians and
Philosophers, <hi>old</hi> ones and all, have, in
all the Pains taken about them; imploy'd
their Thoughts about nothing. And I
would be glad to know what those <hi>Things</hi>
are, which your Lordship says <hi>our Debate
goes upon here as really existing,</hi> that are <hi>Beings</hi>
more then <hi>Numbers</hi> and <hi>Figures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship's next exception against
my way of Demonstration is,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 131.</note> That <hi>in it
I am inconsistent with my self.</hi> For Proof of
it, you say <hi>I design to prove Demonstrations
without general Principles; and yet every one
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65912:176"/>
knows that general Principles are supposed in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks.
Answ.</hi> Every one may know
that general Principles are supposed in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks
without knowing, or ever being
able to know, that I who say also that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians
do often make use of them,
am inconsistent with my self, though I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
say, That a demonstration about Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and Figures may be made without
them.</p>
            <p>To prove me Inconsistent with my self,
you add:<note n="†" place="margin">p. 131.</note> 
               <hi>And that Person would be thought
Ridiculous, who should go about to prove, That
general Principles are of little, or of dangerous
use in Mathematical Demonstrations. Answ.</hi>
A Man may make other Ridiculous Faults
in Writing, besides Inconsistency, and there
are Instances enough of it: But by good luck
I am in this place clear of what <hi>would be
thought Ridiculous,</hi> which yet is no proof
of Inconsistency. For I never <hi>went about
to prove, That general Principles are of little
or dangerous use in Mathematical Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove me Inconsistent with my self,
your Lordship uses<note n="*" place="margin">p. 131.</note> one Argument more,
and that is, That <hi>I confess that the way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
in Morality, is from Principles, as
those of Mathematicks by necessary Consequences.
Answ.</hi> With Submission, my Lord, I do not
say in the place quoted by your Lordship,<note n="†" place="margin">B. 4. C. 3. § 18.</note>
               <hi>That the way of Demonstration in Morality <hi>is</hi>
from Principles, as those of the Mathematicks
by necessary Consequences.</hi> But this is that
which I say. <q>That I doubt not but in
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:65912:177"/>
Morality from Principles, as <hi>incontestable</hi>
as those of the Mathematicks by necessary
Consequences, the measures of right and
wrong might be made out.</q> Which
Words, I humbly conceive, have no Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
with my saying, there may be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
without the help of <hi>Maxims:</hi>
Whatever Inconsistency the Words which
you here set down for mine, may have with
it.</p>
            <p>My Lord, the Words you bring out of
my Book, are so often different, from those
I read in the places which you refer to,
that I am sometimes ready to think, you
have got some strange Copy of it, whereof
I know nothing, since it so seldom agrees
with mine. Pardon me, my Lord, if with
some care I examin the Objection of <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
with my self,</hi> that if I find any, I may
retract one part or the other of it. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Frailty I grant, and variety of Thoughts
in long Discourses, may make a Man unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
advance Inconsistencies. This may
consist with Ingenuity, and deserve to be
excused. But for any one to persist in it,
when it is shewed him, is to give himself
the Lye, which cannot but stick closer to
him in the Sense of all rational Men, than
if he received it from another.</p>
            <p>I own, I have said, in my Essay, That
there be Demonstrations, which may be
made without those general Maxims, that
I there treated of. But I cannot recollect,
that I ever said, that those general Maxims
could not be made use of in Demonstration:
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:65912:177"/>
For they are no more shut out of my way
of Demonstration, than any other self-evident
Propositions. And therefore there
is no Inconsistency in those two Propositions,
which are mine, <hi>viz. Some Demonstrations
may be made without the help of those general
Maxims. And Morality, I doubt not, may
be demonstrated from Principles,</hi> whatever
Inconsistency may be in these two following
Propositions, which are your Lordship's,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 131. &amp; 132.</note>
and not mine, <hi>viz. The way of Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Morality is from Principles,</hi> and <hi>general
Maxims are not the way to proceed on in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
as to other parts of Knowledge.</hi>
For to admit <hi>self-evident Propositions,</hi> which
is what I mean by <hi>Principles,</hi> in the place of
my Essay,<note n="†" place="margin">B. 4. C. 3. § 18.</note> which your Lordship quotes
for the first of my inconsistent Propositions,
and to say (as I do in the other place quoted
by your Lordship)<note n="*" place="margin">B. 4. C. 7. § 10.</note> 
               <q>That those magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Maxims are not the Principles and
Foundations of all our other Knowledge
has no manner of Inconsistency.</q> For
though I think them not necessary to every
Demonstration, so neither do I exclude them
any more, than other self-evident Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
out of any Demonstration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
any one should make use of them.</p>
            <p>The next Objection<note n="†" place="margin">p. 133.</note> against my way of
Demonstration, from <hi>my placing Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the self evidence of Ideas,</hi> having been
already answer'd, I shall need to say nothing
in defence of it; or in answer to any thing
raised against it, in your Twelve or Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
following Pages upon that Topick.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:65912:178"/>
But that your Lordship may not think, I
do not pay a due respect to all that you say,
I shall not wholly pass those Pages over in
Silence.</p>
            <p>1. Your Lordship says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 134.</note> That <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that some of the most obvious Ideas are far
from being self-evident. Answ.</hi> Supposing I
did say so, how, I beseech your Lordship,
does it prove, That <hi>it is impossible to come to
a Demonstration about real Beings, in this way
of Intuition by Ideas?</hi> Which is the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
you Promise<note n="*" place="margin">p. 134.</note> 
               <hi>to make appear,</hi> and
you bring this as the <hi>first Reason</hi> to make it
appear. For should <hi>I confess</hi> a Thousand
times over, <hi>That some of the most obvious Ideas,
are far from being self-evident:</hi> And should I,
which I do not, make <hi>Self-evident Ideas</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Demonstration, how will it thence
follow, That <hi>it is impossible to come to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,</hi>
&amp;c? Since though I should <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
some of the most obvious Ideas not to be Self-evident;</hi>
yet my Confession being but of
<hi>some,</hi> it will not follow from my Confession,
but that there may be also some <hi>Self-evident;</hi>
and so still it might be possible to come to
Demonstration by Intuition, because <hi>some</hi>
in my use of the Word never signifies <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, give me leave to ask,
where it is that I confess, That <hi>some Ideas
are not self-evident?</hi> Nay, where it is, that
I once mention any such thing as a <hi>self-evident
Idea?</hi> For self-evident is an Epithite, that
I do not remember I ever gave to any Idea;
or thought belonged at all to Ideas. In all
the places you have produced out of my
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:65912:178"/>
Essay, concerning <hi>Matter, Motion, Time,
Duration</hi> and <hi>Light;</hi> Which are those Ideas
your Lordship is pleased to instance in, to
prove, That <hi>I have confessed it of some,</hi> I
crave leave humbly to offer it to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
that there is not any such Confession.
However you go on to prove it. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
then to be proved, is, That <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that these are far from being self-evident
Ideas.</hi> 'Tis necessary to set it down and
carry it in our Minds, for the Proposition to
be proved, is, I find, a very slippery thing,
and apt to slide out of the way.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's Proof is,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 134.</note> That accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to me, <hi>we can have no Intuition of these
Things which are so Obvious to us, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
we can have no self-evident Ideas of
them.</hi>
The force of which Proof, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
I do not understand. <hi>We have no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition
of the obvious thing Matter, and the
obvious thing Motion,</hi> Ergo, we have no self-evident
Ideas of them. Granting that they
are <hi>obvious Things,</hi> and that <hi>obvious</hi> as they
are, we have as you express it, no <hi>Intuition</hi>
of them, it will not follow from thence,
that we have no <hi>Intuition</hi> of the Ideas we
signify by the names <hi>Matter and Motion,</hi> and
so have no <hi>self-evident Ideas</hi> of them. For
whoever has in his Mind an Idea, which he
makes the name <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Motion</hi> stand for,
has no doubt that Idea there, and sees or
has in your phrase an <hi>Intuition</hi> of it there,
and so has a <hi>self-evident Idea</hi> of it, if <hi>Intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
according to your Lordship, makes
a <hi>self-evident Idea</hi> (for of self-evident Ideas,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:65912:179"/>
as I have before remarked, I have said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
nor made any such distinction as <hi>self-evident</hi>
and <hi>not self-evident Ideas</hi>) and if <hi>intuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of an Idea does not make a <hi>self-evident
Idea,</hi> the want of it is in vain brought here
to prove the Idea of <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Motion</hi> not
<hi>self-evident.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But your Lordship proceeds to Instances,
and your first Instance is in <hi>Matter;</hi> and
here for fear of mistaking, let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what the Proposition to be proved is,
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>according to me, we have no intuition,</hi>
as you call it, <hi>of the Idea of Matter.</hi> Your
Lordship begins and tells me,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 135.</note> that I give this
account of the Idea of Matter, That <hi>it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in a solid Substance, every where the same.</hi>
Whereupon you tell me,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 135.</note> You <hi>would be
glad to come to a certain Knowledge of these
two things;</hi> First, <hi>The manner of the Cohesion
of the parts of Matter, and</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">p. 137.</note> 
               <hi>the Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the divisibility of it in the way of Ideas.
Answer.</hi> It happened just as I feared, the
Proposition to be proved is slip'd already
quite out of sight: You own that I say
Matter is a solid Substance, every where
the same. This Idea, which is the Idea I
signifie by the Word <hi>Matter,</hi> I have in my
Mind, and have <hi>an intuition</hi> of it there:
How then does this prove, That according
to me, there <hi>can be no intuition of the Idea
of Matter?</hi> Leaving therefore this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
which was to be proved, you bring
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 135-137.</note> places out of my Book to shew, That we
do not know wherein the Union and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hesion
of the parts of Matter consists; and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:65912:179"/>
that the divisibility of Matter involves us
in difficulties, neither of which either is,
or proves, That, according to me, we
cannot have <hi>an intuition of the Idea of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
which was the Proposition to be proved,
and seems quite forgotten during the three
following Pages, wholly imploied upon this
Instance of Matter. You ask indeed,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 136.</note>
whether <hi>I can imagine, That we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition
into the Idea of Matter?</hi> But those
Words seem to me to signifie quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, than having <hi>an intuition of the
Idea of Matter,</hi> as appears by your Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them in these Words subjoined,
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 136.</note> 
               <hi>Or that it is possible to come to a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
about it, by the help of any intervening
Ideas;</hi> whereby it seems to me plain, that
by <hi>intuition into it,</hi> your Lordship means <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
about it,</hi> i. e. some Knowledge
concerning Matter, and not a bare view or
intuition of the Idea you have of it: And
that your Lordship speaks of <hi>Knowledge</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
some affection of Matter in this,
and the following Question; and not of
the bare <hi>intuition</hi> of the Idea of Matter, is
farther evident from the Introduction of
your two Questions,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 135.</note> wherein you say,
<hi>There are two things concerning Matter, that
you would be glad to come to a certain <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
of.</hi> So that all that can follow, or in
your Sense of them does follow from my
Words quoted by you, is, that I own,
That the Cohesion of its parts is an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Matter, that is hard to be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but from them it can neither be infer'd,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:65912:180"/>
nor does your Lordship attempt to infer,
That any one cannot view or <hi>have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition</hi>
of the Idea he has in his own Mind,
which he signifies to others by the Word
<hi>Matter;</hi> and that you did not make any such
Inference from them is farther plain, by
your asking, in the place above quoted,
not only whether <hi>I can imagine, That it is
possible to come to a Demonstration about it?</hi>
But your Lordship also adds, <hi>By the help of
any intervening Ideas?</hi> For I do not think
you demand a <hi>Demonstration by the help of
intervening</hi> Ideas, to make you to see, <hi>i. e.</hi>
have an <hi>intuition</hi> of your own <hi>Idea of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
It would mis-become me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
your Lordship in so strange a Sense;
for then you might have just Occasion to
ask me again, whether <hi>I could think you a
Man of so little Sense?</hi> I therefore suppose,
as your Words import, That you demand
a <hi>Demonstration by the help of intervening
Ideas</hi> to shew you, how the parts of that
thing, which you represent to your self by
that Idea, to which you give the name Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Cohere together; which is nothing to
the question of the <hi>intuition of the Idea,</hi>
though to cover the change of the question,
as dextrously as might be, <hi>intuition of the
Idea,</hi> is changed into <hi>intuition into the Idea;</hi>
as if there were no difference between
looking upon a <hi>Watch,</hi> and looking into a
<hi>Watch,</hi> i. e. between the Idea, that taken
from an obvious View, I signifie by the
name <hi>Watch,</hi> and have in my Mind when
I use the Word <hi>Watch;</hi> and the being able
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:65912:180"/>
to resolve any Question that may be proposed
to me, concerning the inward Make and
Contrivance of a Watch. The Idea which
taken from the outward visible parts, I
give the name Watch to, the Idea I perceive
or <hi>have an intuition of,</hi> in my Mind equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whether or no I know any thing more
of a Watch, than what is represented in that
Idea.</p>
            <p>Upon this change of the question, all
that follows to the bottom of the next Page
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 137.</note> being to shew, that from what I say it
follows, that there be many Difficulties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Matter, which I cannot resolve;
many questions concerning it, which I
think cannot be demonstratively decided;
and not to shew, that any one cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
or have an <hi>intuition,</hi> as you call it,
of his own Idea of Matter: I think I need not
trouble your Lordship with an Answer to
it.</p>
            <p>In this one Instance of <hi>Matter,</hi> you have
been pleased to ask me two hard Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.
To shorten your Trouble concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Business <hi>of intuition of Ideas,</hi> will
you, my Lord, give me leave to ask you
this one easie Question concerning all your
four Instances, <hi>Matter, Motion, Duration,</hi>
and <hi>Light,</hi> viz. what you mean by these
four Words? That your Lordship may
not suspect it to be either Captious or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
I will tell you the Use I shall
make of it: If your Lordship tell me what
you mean by these Names, I shall presently
reply, That there then are the Ideas that
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:65912:181"/>
you have of them in your Mind; and 'tis
plain you see or <hi>have an intuition</hi> of them,
as they are in your Mind, or as I should
have expressed it, perceive them as they
are there; because you can tell them to an
other. And so it is with every one, who
can tell what he means by those Words;
and therefore to all such (amongst which
I crave leave to be one) there can be no
doubt of the <hi>intuition of those Ideas.</hi> But
if your Lordship will not tell me what you
mean by these Terms, I fear you will be
thought to use very hard Measure in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting,
by demanding to be satisfied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Questions put in Terms, which
you your self cannot tell the meaning of.</p>
            <p>This consider'd will perhaps serve to
shew, that all that you say in the following
Paragraphs, to <hi>N. 2. P.</hi> 141. contains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
against <hi>intuition of Ideas,</hi> which is
what you are upon, though it be no Notion
of mine; much less does it contain any
thing against <hi>my way of Demonstration by
Ideas;</hi> which is the Point under Proof.
For</p>
            <p>1. What your Lordship has said about the
Idea of <hi>Matter,</hi> hath been considered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>2. From <hi>Motion,</hi> which is your second
Instance, your Argument stands thus,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 138.</note>
That because I say, the Definitions I meet
with of <hi>Motion</hi> are insignificant, therefore
<hi>the Idea fails us.</hi> This seems to me a strange
Consequence; and all one, as to say, That
a deaf and dumb Man, because he could not
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:65912:181"/>
understand the Words used in the Definitions,
that are given of Motion, therefore he could
not have the Idea of <hi>Motion,</hi> or the <hi>Idea</hi> of
Motion <hi>failed him.</hi> And yet this Consequence,
as Foreign as it is to that Antecedent, is
forced from it, to no purpose: The Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be inser'd being this, That then <hi>we
can have no intuition of the Idea of Motion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>As to Time,</hi> though the <hi>intuition of the
Idea</hi> of Time be not my way of speaking,
yet what your Lordship here infers from
my Words, granting it to be a right In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
with Submission, proves nothing
against the <hi>intuition of</hi> that <hi>Idea.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to be proved, is, That <hi>we can have
no intuition</hi> of the Idea of Time; and the
Proposition which from my Words you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 139.</note> is, That <hi>we have not the Knowledge
of the Idea of Time by intuition, but by ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Deduction;</hi> What can be more remote
than these two Propositions? The one of
them signifying (if it signifies any thing)
the View the Mind has of it; the other,
as I guess, the Original and Rise of it. For
what it is <hi>to have the Knowledge of an Idea,
not by intuition, but by deduction of Reason,</hi> I
confess, I do not well understand; only I
am sure, in Terms it is not the same with
<hi>having the intuition of an Idea:</hi> But if chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Terms were not some Mens Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
perhaps so much Controversie would
not be written. The meaning of either of
these Propositions, I concern not my self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
for neither of them is mine. I
only here shew, That you do not prove the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:65912:182"/>
Proposition, that you your self framed,
and undertook to prove.</p>
            <p>Since, my Lord, you are so favourable
to me, as to seem willing to Correct what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you can find any way amiss in my
<hi>Essay:</hi> Therefore I shall endeavour to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
you concerning the Rise of our Idea of
<hi>Duration</hi> from the <hi>Succession of Ideas</hi> in our
Minds. Against this, though it be nothing
to the Matter in Hand, you object, That
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 139.</note> 
               <hi>some People reckoned Succession of Time right
by Knots, and Notches, and Figures, without
ever thinking of Ideas. Answer.</hi> 'Tis certain,
that Men, who wanted better ways, might
by <hi>Knots</hi> or <hi>Notches,</hi> keep accounts of the
Numbers of certain stated lengths of Time,
as well as of the Numbers of Men in their
Country, or of any other Numbers; and
that too without ever considering the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Objects of their Thoughts under
the Name of <hi>Ideas:</hi> But that they should
count Time without ever thinking of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
is very hard to me to conceive;
and the things they thought on, or were
present in their Minds, when they thought,
are what I call <hi>Ideas;</hi> thus much in answer
to what your Lordship says. But to any one,
that shall put the Objection stronger, and say,
Many have had the Idea of Time, who
never reflected on the constant Train of
Ideas, succeeding one another in their Minds,
whilst waking, I grant it; but add, that
want of Reflection makes not any thing
cease to be: If it did, many Mens Actions
would have no Cause, nor Rise, nor Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:65912:182"/>
because many Men never reflect so
far on their own Actions, as to consider
what they are bottomed on, or how they
are performed. A Man may measure Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
by Motion, of which he has no other
Idea, but of a constant Succession of Ideas
in Train; and yet never reflect on that
Succession of Ideas in his Mind. A Man
may guess at the length of his stay by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the dark; here is no Succession to
measure by, but that of his own Thoughts;
and without some Succession, I think there
is no measure of Duration. But though in
this Case, he measures the length of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
by the Train of his Ideas, yet he
may never reflect on that, but conclude he
does it he knows not how.</p>
            <p>You add,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 140.</note> But besides, <hi>such</hi> Arbitrary
Measures of Time, what need any recourse to
Ideas, when the returns of Days, and Months,
and Years, by the Planetary Motions, are so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and so universal?<note n="*" place="margin">p. 140.</note> 
               <hi>Such</hi> here, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
refers to the <hi>Knots,</hi> and <hi>Notches,</hi> and
<hi>Figures</hi> before mentioned: If it does not,
I know not what it refers to; and if it does,
it makes those <hi>Knots</hi> and <hi>Notches</hi> Measures of
Time, which I humbly conceive they were
not, but only Arbitrary ways of Recording
(as all other ways of Recording are) certain
Numbers of known lenghts of Time: For
tho' any one sets down by <hi>Arbitrary</hi> marks,
as <hi>Notches</hi> on a Stick, or <hi>Strokes</hi> of Chalk on
a Trenchard, or Figures on Paper, the
Number of Yards of Cloth, or Pints of
Milk that are delivered to a Customer; yet,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65912:183"/>
I suppose, no Body thinks, that the Cloth
or Milk were measured by those <hi>Notches,</hi>
strokes of Chalk or <hi>Figures,</hi> which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are by no means the <hi>arbitrary Measures</hi>
of those Things. But what this is against,
I confess I do not see: This I am sure, it
is not against any thing I have said. For, as
I remember, I have said (though not the
<hi>planetary Motions</hi> yet) that the Motions of
the Sun and the Moon, are the best Measures
of Time. But if you mean, That the Idea
of Duration is rather taken from the <hi>plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Motions,</hi> than from the succession of
Ideas in our Minds, I crave leave to doubt
of That: Because Motion no other way dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
it self to us, but by a succession of
Ideas.</p>
            <p>Your next Argument against my thinking
the Idea of Time to be derived from the
train of Ideas, succeeding one another in
our Minds, is, That your Lordship<note n="*" place="margin">p. 140.</note> 
               <hi>thinks
the contrary.</hi> This, I must own, is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
by way of Authority, and I humbly
submit to it, though I think such Arguments
produce no <hi>Certainty,</hi> either in my <hi>way of
Certainty by Ideas,</hi> or in <hi>your way of Certainty
by Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. As to your fourth Instance, you having
set down<note n="†" place="margin">p. 141.</note> my Exceptions to the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
and Cartesian Definitions of <hi>Light</hi> you
subjoin this Question. <hi>And is this a self-evident
Idea of Light?</hi> I beg leave to Answer
in the same way by a Question, and whoever
said or thought, that it was, or meant that
it should be? He must have a strange <hi>Notion
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:65912:183"/>
of self-evident Ideas,</hi> let them be what they
will (for I know them not) who can think,
that the shewing others definitions of <hi>Light</hi>
to be unintelligible, is a <hi>self-evident Idea of
Light.</hi> But farther, my Lord, what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you has a <hi>self-evident Idea of Light to
do here?</hi> I thought in this your instance of
<hi>Light,</hi> you were making good what you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 134.</note> 
               <hi>to prove from my self that we can
have no intuition of Light.</hi> But because that
perhaps would have sounded pretty odly,
you thought fit (which I with all Submission
crave leave sometimes to take notice of) to
change the Question; but the Misfortune is,
that put as it is, not concerning our <hi>intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition,</hi>
but <hi>the self-evidence</hi> of the Idea of <hi>Light,</hi>
the one is no better proved than the other:
And yet your Lordship concludes this your
first Head according to your usual form.<note n="†" place="margin">p. 141.</note>
               <hi>Thus <hi>we have seen what account</hi>
               </hi> the Author
of the Essay <hi>himself has given of these self-evident
Ideas, which are the ground-work of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</hi>
With Submission, my Lord,
he must have good Eyes, who has seen an
<hi>Account I have given</hi> in my <hi>Essay</hi> of <hi>self-evident
Ideas,</hi> when neither in all that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
has quoted out of it, no nor in my
whole <hi>Essay, self-evident Ideas</hi> are so much
as once mentioned. And where the <hi>Account
I have given</hi> of a thing, which I never
thought upon, is to be <hi>seen,</hi> I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
What your Lordship farther tells
me concerning them, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>self-evident
Ideas are the ground-work of Demonstration,</hi>
I also assure you is perfect News to me,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65912:184"/>
which I never met with any where, but in
your Lordship. Though if I had made them
<hi>the ground-work of Demonstration,</hi> as you say,
I think they might remain so, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any thing your Lordship has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the contrary.</p>
            <p>We are now come to your second Head,
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 141.</note> where I expected to have found this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
made good. <hi>That there may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
Opinions about Ideas, which I account
most clear and <hi>distinct,</hi> Ergo, it is impossible
to come to a Demonstration about real Beings in
the way of intuition of Ideas.</hi> For this you
told me<note n="*" place="margin">p. 134.</note> was your second Reason to prove
this Proposition. This Consequence your
Lordship, it seems, looks upon as so clear,
that it needs no Proof; I can find none
here<note n="†" place="margin">p. 141.</note> where you take it up again. To
prove something, you say, <hi>Suppose an Idea
happen to be thought by some to be clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
and others should think the contrary to
be so?</hi> In Obedience to your Lordship I <hi>do
suppose it.</hi> But, when it is supposed, will
that make good the above-mentioned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence?
You your self, my Lord, do not
so much as pretend it; but in this Question
subjoined,<note n="‖" place="margin">ibid.</note> 
               <hi>What hopes of Demonstration by
clear and distinct Ideas then?</hi> infer a quite
different Proposition. For, <hi>It is impossible
to come to a Demonstration about real Beings
in the way of intuition of Ideas.</hi> And, <hi>There
is no hopes of Demonstration by clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Ideas,</hi> appear to me Two very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Propositions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:65912:184"/>
There appears something to me yet more
incomprehensible in your way of manageing
this Argument here. Your Reason is, as
we have seen in these Words, <hi>There may be
<hi>contradictory</hi> Opinions about some Ideas, that I
account most clear and distinct:</hi> And your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of it is in these Words, <hi>Suppose an
Idea happen to be thought by some to be clear
and distinct, and others should think the <hi>contrary</hi>
to be so. Answ.</hi> So they may without <hi>having
any <hi>contradictory</hi> Opinions about any Idea, that
I account most clear and distinct.</hi> A Man may
think his Idea of Heat to be clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
and another may think his Idea of
Cold (which I take to be the contrary Idea
to that of Heat) to be clear and distinct,
and be both in the right, without the least
appearance of any <hi>contradictory <hi>Opinions.</hi>
               </hi> All
therefore, that your Lordship says, in the
remaining part of this* Paragraph, having
nothing in it of <hi>contradictory <hi>Opinions</hi>
               </hi> about
Ideas that <hi>I think most clear,</hi> serves not at
all to make good your second Reason. The
Truth is, all that you say here concerning
<hi>Des Cartes's Idea of Space,</hi> and <hi>another Man's
Idea of Space</hi> amounts to no more but this,
That different Men may signifie different
Ideas by the same Name; and will never
fix on me, what your Lordship would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the World I say, that <hi>both parts of a
Contradiction may be true.</hi> Though I do say,
That in such a loose use of the terms <hi>Body</hi>
and <hi>Vacuum</hi> it may be demonstrated, both
that there is, and is not a <hi>Vacuum:</hi> Which
is a Contradiction in Words, and is apt to
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:65912:185"/>
impose, as if it were so in Sense, on those
who mistake Words for Things, who are
a kind of Reasoners, whereof I perceive
there is a greater Number than I thought
there had been. All that I have said in that
place quoted by your Lordship,<note n="†" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 7. Sect. 12.</note> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but to shew the danger of relying
upon Maxims, without a careful Guard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the use of Words, without which they
will serve to make Demonstrations on both
sides. That this is so, I dare appeal to
any Reader, should your Lordship press
me again, as you do here, with all the force
of these Words,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 143.</note> 
               <hi>Say you so? What! De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
on both sides? And in the way
of Ideas too? This is extraordinary indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That all the Opposition between <hi>Des
Cartes</hi> and <hi>those Others,</hi> is only about the
naming of Ideas, I think may be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
from these Words of your Lordship in
the next Paragraph,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 143.</note> 
               <hi>In the Ideas of Space
and Body, the Question supposed is whether
they be the same or no.</hi> That this is a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
only about Names, and not about I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
themselves, is evident from hence,
that no Body can doubt whether the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Idea of pure Distance, and the two I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
of <hi>Distance</hi> and <hi>Solidity</hi> are one and
the same Idea or different Ideas, any more
than he can doubt, whether <hi>one</hi> and <hi>two</hi>
are different. The Question then in the
Case, is not whether <hi>Extension</hi> considered
separately by it self, or <hi>Extension</hi> and <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi>
together be the same Idea or no; but
whether the simple Idea of <hi>Extension</hi> alone
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:65912:185"/>
shall be called <hi>Body,</hi> or the complex Idea of
<hi>Solidity</hi> and <hi>Extension</hi> together, shall be called
<hi>Body.</hi> For that these Ideas themselves are
different, I think I need not go about to
prove to any one, who ever thought of
<hi>Emptiness</hi> or <hi>Fulness;</hi> for whether in the Fact,
the Bottle in a Man's hand be empty or no,
or can by him be emptied or no, This, I
think, is plain, That his Idea of Fulness,
and his Idea of Emptiness are not the same.
This the very Dispute concerning a <hi>Vacuum</hi>
supposes; for if Mens Idea of pure Space
were not different from their Idea of <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi>
and <hi>Space</hi> together, they could never so
far separate them in their Thoughts, as
to make a Question, whether they did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Exist together, any more than they
could Question, whether the same thing
existed with it self. Motion cannot be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
in Existence from Space: And yet
no body ever took the Idea of <hi>Space</hi> and
the Idea of <hi>Motion</hi> to be the same. <hi>Solidity</hi>
likewise cannot Exist without <hi>Space;</hi> but
will any one from thence say, the Idea of
<hi>Solidity</hi> and the Idea of <hi>Space</hi> are one and
the same?</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's third Reason to prove,
That <hi>it is impossible to come to a Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about real Beings in this way of intuition
of Ideas, is,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 134.</note> 
               <hi>That granting the Ideas to be
true, there is no self-evidence of the Connection
of them which is necessary to make a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.</hi>
This, I must own, is to me as
incomprehensible a Consequence as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
As also is that which your Lordship
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:65912:186"/>
says<note n="†" place="margin">p. 143.</note> to make it out, which I shall set
down in your own Words, that its force
may be left entire to the Reader; <hi>But
granting the Ideas to be true, yet when their
Connection is not self-evident, then an interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Idea must compleat the Demonstration:
But how doth it appear, that this middle Idea
is self-evidently connected with them? For 'tis
said,</hi> if that intermediate Idea be non known
by intuition, that must need a proof; <hi>and
so there can be no Demonstration; which your
Lordship is very apt to believe in this way of
Ideas; unless Ideas get more Light by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put between two others.</hi> Whatever there
be in these Words to prove the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Question, I leave the Reader to
find out; but that he may not be led into
a Mistake, that there is any thing in my
Words, that may be serviceable to it, I
must crave leave to acquaint him, That
these Words set down by your Lordship,
as out of my <hi>Essay,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">B. 4. C. 2. § 7.</note> are not to be found
in that place, nor any where in my Book,
or any thing to this purpose, <hi>That the
intermediate Idea is to be known by intuition;</hi>
but this, That there must be an intuitive
Knowledge or Perception of the <hi>Agreement</hi>
or <hi>Disagreement</hi> of the intermediate Idea
with those, whose Agreement or Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by its intervention it demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</p>
            <p>Leaving therefore all that your Lordship
brings out of <hi>Gassendus,</hi> the <hi>Cartesians, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,</hi>
and <hi>Bernier,</hi> in their Argument from
<hi>Motion,</hi> for or against a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:65912:186"/>
at all concerned in it; I shall only
crave leave to observe, that you seem to
make use here of the same way of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
which I think I may call your
main, if not only one, it occurs so often,
<hi>viz.</hi> That when I have said any thing to
shew, wherein <hi>Certainty</hi> or <hi>Demonstration,</hi>
&amp;c. consists, you think it sufficiently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
if you can produce any Instance
out of my Book, of any thing advanced by
me, which comes short of Certainty or
Demonstration: Whereas, my Lord, I
humbly conceive, it is no Proof against
my Notion of <hi>Certainty,</hi> or my way of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,</hi>
that I cannot attain to them
in all Cases. I only tell wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
where-ever they are; but if I miss of
either of them, either by reason of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Subject, or by inadvertency in
my way of Proof, that is no Objection to
the Truth of my Notions of them: For I
never undertook that <hi>my way</hi> of Certainty
or Demonstration, if it ought to be called
<hi>my way,</hi> should make me or any one Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscient
or Infallible.</p>
            <p>That which makes it necessary for me
here again to take notice of this your way
of Reasoning, is the Question wherewith
you wind up the Account you have given
of the Dispute of the Parties above named
about a <hi>Vacuum,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">p. 145.</note> 
               <hi>And is it possible to
imagin, that there should be a self-evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
in the Case? Answer.</hi> It concerns
not me to examine, whether, or on which
side, in that Dispute, such <hi>a self evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection</hi>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:65912:187"/>
is, or is not possible. But this I take the
liberty to say, That where-ever it is not,
there is no Demonstration, whether it be
the <hi>Cartesians</hi> or the <hi>Gassendists</hi> that failed
in this Point. And I humbly conceive,
that to conclude from any one's failing in
this, or any other Case, of a self-evident
Connection in each step of his Proof, that
therefore it is not necessary in Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is a Conclusion without Grounds, and
a way of Arguing that proves nothing.</p>
            <p>In the next Paragraph<note n="*" place="margin">p. 145.</note> you come to
wind up the Argument, which you have
been so long upon, <hi>viz.</hi> to make good what
you undertook,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 105.</note> i e. <hi>To shew the difference
of my Method of Certainty by Ideas, and the
Method of Certainty by Reason.</hi> In answer to
my saying, I can find no Opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; which Opposition, according
to the account you give of it, after forty
Pages spent in it, amounts at last to this:</p>
            <p>(1.) That<note n="*" place="margin">p. 146.</note> I affirm, That general Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Maxims of Reason, are of little
or no use; and your Lordship <hi>says, they are
of very great use, and the only proper Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Certainty.</hi> To which I crave leave
to say, That if by <hi>Principles and Maxims,</hi>
your Lordship means all self-evident Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
our ways are even in this part
the same; for as you know, may Lord, I
make self-evident Propositions necessary to
Certainty, and found all Certainty only in
them. If by <hi>Principles and Maxims,</hi> you
mean a select number of self-evident Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
distinguished from the rest by
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:65912:187"/>
the name <hi>Maxims,</hi> which is the Sense in
which I use the term <hi>Maxims</hi> in my <hi>Essay;</hi>
then to bring it to a Decision, which of us
Two, in this Point, is in the right, it will
be necessary for your Lordship to give a
List of those <hi>Maxims;</hi> and then to shew,
That a Man can be certain of no Truth,
without the help of those <hi>Maxims.</hi> For to
affirm <hi>Maxims</hi> to be the <hi>only Foundations of
Certainty,</hi> and yet not to tell, which are
those <hi>Maxims;</hi> or how they may be known,
is, I humbly conceive, so far from laying
any sure grounds of Certainty, that it leaves
even the very Foundations of it uncertain.
When your Lordship has thus setled the
grounds of <hi>your way of Certainty by Reason,</hi>
one may be able to examine, whether it
be truly the way of Reason, and how far
my <hi>way of Certainty by Ideas</hi> differs from
it.</p>
            <p>The second Difference that you assign
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 146.</note> between my <hi>way of Certainty by Ideas,</hi>
and yours by <hi>Reason,</hi> is, that <hi>I say, That
Demonstration is by way of intuition of Ideas,
and that Reason is only the Faculty imploy'd in
discovering and comparing Ideas with themselves,
or with others intervening; and that this is the
only way of Certainty.</hi> Whereas your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<hi>affirms, and,</hi> as you say, <hi>have proved,
That there can be no Demonstration by intuition
of Ideas; but that all the Certainty we can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to, is from general Principles of Reason,
and necessary Deductions made from them.
Answ.</hi> I have said, That Demonstration
consists in the Perception of the Agreement
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:65912:188"/>
or Disagreement of the Intermediate Idea
with those, whose Agreement or Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is to shew, in each step of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration:
And if you will say this is
different from the way of Demonstration
by Reason, it will then be to the Point above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
which you have been so long
upon. If this be your Meaning here, it
seems pretty strangely expressed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
to be proved: But if any thing else
be your Meaning, that Meaning not being
the Proposition to be proved, it matters not
whether you have proved it or no.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship farther says here,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 146.</note> 
               <hi>That
all the</hi> Certainty we can attain <hi>to, is from
general Principles of Reason, and necessary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
made from them.</hi> This, you say, you
<hi>have proved.</hi> What has been proved; is to
be seen in what has been already consider'd.
But if your Proof, <hi>That all the Certainty we
can attain to, is from general Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and necessary Deductions made from them,</hi>
were as clear and cogent, as it seems to me
the contrary, this will not reach to the
Point in Debate, till your Lordship has
proved, That this is opposite to my way
of Certainty by Ideas. 'Tis strange (and
perhaps to some-may be matter of thought)
that in an Argument, wherein you lay so
much stress on <hi>Maxims, general Principles of
Reason,</hi> and <hi>necessary Deductions from them,</hi>
you should never once tell us, what, in
your account, a <hi>Maxim</hi> or <hi>general Principle
of Reason</hi> is, nor the Marks it is to be known
by; nor offer to shew what a <hi>necessary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,</hi>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:65912:188"/>
is, nor how it is to be made, or may
be known. For I have seen Men please
themselves with <hi>Deductions</hi> upon <hi>Deductions;</hi>
and spin Consequences, it matter'd not
whether out of their own or other Men's
Thoughts, which, when looked into, were
visibly nothing but meer Ropes of Sand.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, your Lordship says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 114.</note> 
               <hi>you now
come to Certainty of Reason by Deductions.</hi> But
when all that truly learned Discourse, which
follows, is read over and over again, I
would be glad to be told, what it is your
Lordship calls a <hi>necessary Deduction;</hi> and by
what <hi>Criterion</hi> you distinguish it from such
Deductions, as come short of Certainty, or
even of Truth it self. I confess I have read
over those Pages more than once, and can
find no such <hi>Criterion</hi> laid down in them, by
your Lordship; though a <hi>Criterion</hi> be there
much talked of. But whether it be my want
of Capacity for your way of Writing, that
makes me not find any Light given by your
Lordship into this Matter: Or whether
in Truth you have not shewed, wherein,
what you call a <hi>necessary Deduction</hi> consists,
and how it may be known from what is
not so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Reader must judge. This I
crave leave to say, That when you have
shewn what <hi>general Principles of Reason</hi> and
<hi>necessary Deductions</hi> are, the World will then
see, and not till then, whether this your
way of <hi>Certainty by Reason, from general Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and necessary Deductions made from them,</hi>
be opposite to, or so much as different from,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:65912:189"/>
my way of Certainty by Ideas, which was
the thing to be shewn.</p>
            <p>In the Paragraph<note n="*" place="margin">p. 145.</note> under Consideration,
you blame me, that in my Chapter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Reason,</hi> I have treated it only as a <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and not in the other <hi>Senses,</hi> which I there
give of that Word. This Exception to my
Book, is, I suppose, only from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
general Care of letting nothing pass
in my <hi>Essay,</hi> which you think needs an
amendment. For any particular Reason,
that brings it in here, or ties it on to this
part of your Discourse, I confess I do not
see. However, to this I Answer.</p>
            <p>1. The Understanding as a Faculty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Subject of my <hi>Essay,</hi> it carried me
to treat directly of Reason no otherwise
than as a Faculty. But yet <hi>Reason</hi> as stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for true and clear Principles, and also
as standing for clear and fair Deductions,
from those Principles I have not wholly
omitted; as is manifest from what I have
said of self-evident Propositions, intuitive
Knowledge and Demonstration, in other
parts of my <hi>Essay.</hi> So that your Question,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 145.</note> 
               <hi>Why in a Chapter of Reason are the other two
Senses of the word Neglected?</hi> Blaming me for
no other Fault, that I am really guilty of,
but want of Order, and not putting every
thing in its <hi>proper Place;</hi> does not appear
to be of so mighty weight, but that I should
have thought it might have been left to the
little Niblers in Controversie, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made use of by so great a Man as your
Lordship. But the putting things out of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:65912:189"/>
their <hi>proper Place,</hi> being that, which your
Lordship thinks fit to except against in my
Writings, it so falls out, that to this too,
I can plead not guilty. For in that very
Chapter<note n="†" place="margin">§ 2. 3, 4, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</note> of Reason, I have not omitted
to treat of <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Deductions;</hi> and
what I have said there, I presume is enough
to let others see, That I have not neglected
to declare my poor Sense about self-evident
Propositions; and the cogency and evidence
of demonstrative or probable Deductions of
Reason. Though what I have said there,
not being back'd with Authorities, nor war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by the Names of ancient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
was not worth your Lordship's taking
notice of.</p>
            <p>I have, I confess, been so unwary to
write out of my own Thoughts, which
your Lordship has, more than once, with
some sort of Reprimand taken notice of.
I own it, your Lordship is much in the
right: The safer way is, never to declare
ones own Sense in any material Point. If
I had fill'd my Book with Quotations and
Collections, of other Mens Opinions, it had
shewn much more Learning, and had much
more security in it; and I my self had been
safe from the Attacks of the Men of Arms,
in the Common-wealth of Letters: But in
writing my Book, I had no Thoughts of
War, my Eye was fixed only on Truth,
and that with so sincere and unbiassed an
Endeavour, that I thought, I should not
have incur'd much Blame, even where I had
missed it. This I perceive, too late, was
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:65912:190"/>
the wrong way: I should have kept my
self still safe upon the reserve. Had I learnt
this Wisdom of <hi>Thrase</hi> in <hi>Terence,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
with my self, <hi>Hic ego ero post Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi>
perhaps I might have deserv'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
was given him: <hi>Illuc est Sapere ut
hos instruxit ipsus sibi cavit loco:</hi> But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to be soundly Corrected, for not
having profited by Reading, so much as
this comes to.</p>
            <p>But to return to your Accusation here,
which altogether stands thus:<note n="*" place="margin">p. 145.</note> 
               <hi>Why in a
Chapter of Reason are the other two Senses ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected?
We might have expected here full, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
as to the Principles of Reason, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the Faculty, but</hi> the Author of the
<hi>Essay wholly avoids</hi> it. What I guess these
Words accuse me to have <hi>avoided,</hi> I think
I have shewn already, that I did not <hi>avoid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before you conclude,</hi> you say,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 146.</note> you <hi>must
observe that I prove, That Demonstration must
be by Intuition, in an extraordinary manner from
the Sense of the Word.</hi> He that will be at
the Pains to read that Paragraph,<note n="*" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 2. § 3.</note> which
you quote for it, will see, that I do not
prove that <hi>it must be by Intuition,</hi> because, it
is called <hi>Demonstration;</hi> but that it is called
<hi>Demonstration,</hi> because it is <hi>by Intuition,</hi> And
as to the Propriety of it, what your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
says in the following Words,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 147.</note> 
               <hi>It
would be most proper for ocular Demonstration
or by the Finger,</hi> will not hinder it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>proper</hi> also in mental Demonstration, as
long as the Perception of the Mind, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
expressed by seeing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:65912:190"/>
Against my observing that the <hi>Notation</hi> of
the word Imported shewing or making to
see, your Lordship farther says,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 152.</note> 
               <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
among some Philosophers, signified only</hi>
the conclusion of an Argument, <hi>whereby we
are brought from something we did perceive, to
something we did not;</hi> which seems to me to
agree, with what I say in the Case, <hi>viz.</hi>
That by the agreement of Ideas, which we
do perceive, we are brought to perceive the
agreement of Ideas, which before we did
not perceive. To which no doubt will be
answered, as in a like Case, * <hi>Not by a way
of Intuition, but by a Deduction of Reason,</hi> i. e.
we perceive not in a way that affords us
<hi>Intuition</hi> or a Sight, but by Deductions of
Reason, wherein we see nothing. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
my Lord, I humbly conceive, That the
force of a Deduction of Reason consists in
this, That in each step of it, we see, what a
Connection it has,, <hi>i. e.</hi> have an Intuition of
the certain Agreement or Disagreement of
the Ideas, as in Demonstration; or an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition
or Perception, that they have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
or not so much as a probable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection,
as in other Deductions of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>You farther overthrow<note n="*" place="margin">p. 147.</note> the necessity of
intuitive Knowledge, in every step of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
by the Authority of <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
who says, <hi>Things that are self-evident, cannot
be Demonstrated.</hi> And so say I too, in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Places of my <hi>Essay</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">B. 4. C. 7. § 10 &amp; 19. and elsewhere. B. 4. C. 2.</note> When your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
can shew any Inconsistency between
these two Propositions, <hi>viz. That intuitive
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65912:191"/>
Knowledge is necessary in each step of a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration;</hi>
and <hi>things that are self-evident cannot
be Demonstrated;</hi> then I shall own you have
overthrown the necessity of Intuition in
every step of a Demonstration by Reason,
as well as by <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Authority.</p>
            <p>In the remainder of this Paragraph,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 148-150.</note> I
meet with nothing but your Lordship find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fault with some, who, <hi>in this Age,</hi> have
made use of Mathematical Demonstrations
in Natural Philosophy. Your Lordship's two
Reasons against this way of advancing Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
upon the sure Grounds of Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Demonstration, are these.</p>
            <p>(1.)<note n="*" place="margin">p. 148.</note> That <hi>Des Cartes a Mathematical
Man, has been guilty of Mistakes</hi> in his <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem.</hi>
Answer,</p>
            <p>When <hi>Mathematical Men</hi> will build Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stems
upon Fancy, and not upon Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration;
they are as liable to Mistakes as
others. And that <hi>Des Cartes</hi> was not led
into his Mistakes by Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
but for want of them, I think
has been Demonstrated<note n="†" place="margin">Newton <hi>Phil. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipia Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themat.</hi> 1. 2. Sect. 9.</note> by some of those
Mathematicians, who seem to be meant
here.</p>
            <p>(2.) Your second Argument against <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating
Mathematicks to the nature of
material things,</hi> is,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 149.</note> 
               <hi>That Mathematicians
cannot be certain of the manner and degrees of
force given to Bodies, so far distant as the fixed
Stars; nor of the Laws of Motion in other
Systems.</hi> A very good Argument why they
should not proceed Demonstratively in this
our System upon Laws of Motion, observed
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:65912:191"/>
to be established here. A Reason that may
perswade us to put out our Eyes, for fear
they should mislead us in what we do
see, because there be things out of our
sight.</p>
            <p>'Tis great pity <hi>Aristotle</hi> had not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
Mathematicks as well as Mr. <hi>Newton,</hi>
and made use of it in Natural Philosophy,
with as good success. His Example had then
authorized <hi>the accommodating of it to Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
things:</hi> But 'tis not to be ventured,
by a Man of <hi>this Age,</hi> to go out of the
Method, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> has prescribed, and
which your Lordship out of him, has set
down in the following Pages,<note n="†" place="margin">150-153.</note> as that
which should be kept to: For it is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Presumption to go out of a Tract
chalked out by that supposed Dictator in
the common Wealth of Letters, though it
led him to the Eternity of the World. I
say not this, That I do not think him a
very great Man; he made himself so, by
not keeping precisely to beaten Tracts,
which servile Subjection of the Mind, if
we may take my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Word for
it, kept the little Knowledge the World
had, from growing greater for more than
a few Ages. That the breaking loose from
it in <hi>this Age</hi> is a Fault, is not directly
said; but there is enough said to shew,
there is no great Approbation of such a
Liberty. Mathematicks in gross, 'tis plain,
are a grievance in Natural Philosophy, and
with Reason: For Mathematical Proofs,
like Diamonds, are hard as well as clear,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:65912:192"/>
and will be touched with nothing but strict
Reasoning; Mathematical Proofs are out
of the reach of Topical Arguments, and
are not to be attacked by the equivocal use
of Words or Declamation, that make so
great a part of other Discourses; nay, even
of Controversies. How well you have
proved my way by Ideas guilty of any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to Scepticism, the Reader will see;
but this I will crave leave to say, That
the secluding Mathematical Reasoning from
Philosophy, and instead thereof reducing
it to <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Rules and Sayings, will
not be thought to be much in favour of
Knowledge against Scepticism.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship indeed says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 149.</note> 
               <hi>You did not
by any means take off from the laudable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of those, who have gone about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Natural Speculations, to Mathematical
Certainty.</hi> What can we understand by
this, but your Lordship's great Complaisance
and Moderation? who notwithstanding you
spend four Pages, to shew that the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of <hi>Mathematical Men, to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
the Principles of that Science, to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Material things, has been the occasion
of great Mistakes in the Philosophy of this Age;</hi>
and that therefore <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Method is to
be followed: Yet you make this Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Mathematicians, That you leave
them to their liberty to go on, if they
please, in their <hi>laudable Endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Natural Speculation, to Mathematical
Certainty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:65912:192"/>
And thus we are come to the end of your
Lordship's <hi>clearing</hi> this Passage; <hi>That you
grant that by Sensation and Reflection, we come
to know the Powers and Properties of Things;
but our Reason</hi> [i. e. <hi>the Principles of Reason
agreed on by Mankind] is satisfied, that there
must be something beyond these; because it is
impossible they should subsist by themselves: so
that the Nature of things properly belongs to
Reason</hi> [i. e. <hi>the Principles of Reason agreed
on by Mankind] and not to meer Ideas.</hi> Which
if any one be so lucky as to understand
by these your Lordship's fifty Pages spent
upon it, better than my Friend did, when
he confessed himself gravelled by it, as it
stands here recited, he ought to enjoy the
Advantage of his happy Genius, whilst I
miss that Satisfaction by the dulness of
mine; which hinders me also from seeing
how the Opposition, the <hi>way of Certainty
by Ideas,</hi> and the <hi>way of Certainty by Reason</hi>
comes in the Explication of this Passage,
or at least if it does belong to it; yet I
must own, what is a greater misfortune,
That I do not see, what the Opposition or
Difference is, which your Lordship has so
much talked of between the <hi>way of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
by Ideas, and the Method of Certainty
by Reason.</hi> For my excuse, I think others
will be as much in the dark as I, since
you no where tell, wherein you your self,
my Lord, place Certainty. So that to talk
of a Difference between <hi>Certainty by Ideas,</hi>
and Certainty that is not by Ideas, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
declaring in what that other Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:65912:193"/>
consists, is like to have no better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
than might be expected from one who
would compare two things together, the
one whereof is not known.</p>
            <p>You now return to your Discourse of
<hi>Nature and Person,</hi> and tell<note n="†" place="margin">p. 154.</note> me, That to
what you said about the <hi>general Nature in
distinct Individuals,</hi> I object these three
Things;</p>
            <p>1. That <q>I cannot put together one and
the same.</q> This I own to be my Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<hi>And consequently there is no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the distinction of Nature and Person.</hi>
This, with Submission, I deny to be any
Objection of mine, either in the place<note n="*" place="margin">2d Let. p. 127.</note>
quoted by your Lordship, or any where
else. There may be Foundation enough for
Distinction, as there is of these two, and
yet they may be treated of in a way so
obscure, so confused, or perhaps so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime,
that an ordinary Capacity may not
from thence get, as your Lordship expresses
it, <hi>clear and distinct apprehensions of them.</hi>
This was that which my Friend and I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of in that place, want of clearness
in your Lordship's discourse, not of want
of distinction in the things themselves.</p>
            <p>(2.) <q>That what your Lordship said
about <hi>common Nature,</hi> and <hi>particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in Individuals,</hi> was wholly unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
to me and my Friends.</q> To which,
my Lord, you may add if you please, That
it is still so to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:65912:193"/>
(3.) That I said, <q>That to speak truly
and precisely of this Matter as in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
it is, there is no such thing as <hi>one
and the same common Nature in several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals,</hi>
for all that in Truth is in
them, is particular and nothing but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Answer.</hi> This was said, to
shew how unapt these Expressions, <hi>The same
common Nature in several Individuals, and
several Individuals being in the same common
Nature,</hi> were to give true and clear No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Nature.</hi> To this your Lordship
answers,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 156.</note> That other, and those <hi>very Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Men</hi> have spoken so: To which I shall
say no more, but that it is an Argument,
with which any thing may be defended;
and all the <hi>Iargon</hi> of the Schools be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
but I presume not strong enough to
bring it back again, let <hi>Men</hi> never so <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi>
make use of it.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship adds,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 146.</note> 
               <hi>But now it seems,
nothing is intelligible but what suits with the
new way of Ideas.</hi> My Lord, <hi>the new way
of Ideas,</hi> and the old way of speaking <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly</hi>
was always, and ever will be the
same. And if I may take the liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
my Sense of it, herein it consists;
(1.) That a Man use no Words but
such as he makes the Signs of certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
Objects of his Mind in Thinking,
which he can make known to another.
(2.) Next, that he use the same Word stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
for the Sign of the same immediate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his Mind in Thinking. (3.) That
he join those Words together in Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:65912:194"/>
according to the Grammatical Rules
of that Language he speaks in. (4.) That
he unite those Sentences in a coherent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
Thus and thus only I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any one may preserve himself from
the Confines and Suspicion of <hi>Iargon,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he pleases to call those immediate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of his Mind, which his Words do,
or should stand for, <hi>Ideas</hi> or no.</p>
            <p>You again<note n="*" place="margin">p. 156.</note> accuse the way of Ideas, to
make a <hi>common Nature, no more than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Name.</hi> That, my Lord, is not my
way by Ideas. When your Lordship shews
me, where I have said so, I promise your
Lordship to strike it out: And the like I
promise, when you shew me where I <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
that we are not to judge of things by
the general Principles of Reason,</hi> which you
call<note n="*" place="margin">p. 156.</note> my <hi>Fundamental Mistake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>These Principles of Reason,</hi> you say,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 157.</note> 
               <hi>must
be the Standard to Mankind.</hi> If they are of
such Consequence, would it not have been
convenient, we should have been instructed
something more particularly about them, than
by barely being told their Name, that we
might be able to know what are, and what
are not <hi>Principles of Reason?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But be they what they will, because they
must be the Standard to Mankind, your
Lordship says,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 157.</note> You <hi>shall in this Debate
proceed upon the following Principles to make it
appear, that the Difference between Nature and
Person is not imaginary and fictitious, but ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the real Nature of things.</hi> With Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
my Lord, you need not be at the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:65912:194"/>
Pains to draw up your great Artillery of so
many <hi>Maxims,</hi> where you meet with no Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
The thing in Debate, whether <hi>in
this Debate</hi> or no, I know not; but what led
into <hi>this Debate,</hi> was about these Expressions,
<hi>One common Nature in several Individuals, and
several Individuals in one common Nature;</hi> and
the Question I thought, was, whether a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
or <hi>common Nature</hi> could be <hi>in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,</hi>
i. e. Exist in Individuals? But since
your Lordship turns your Artillery against
those who deny, That there is any <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Distinction between Nature and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi>
I am out of Gun-shot; for I am none
of those, who ever said, or thought there
was no <hi>Foundation of distinction between Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Maxims you lay down in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Paragraph<note n="†" place="margin">p. 158.</note> are to make me under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
how <hi>one and the same, and distinct
may consist;</hi> I confess, I do not see how your
Lordship's Words there at all make it out.
This, indeed, I do understand, that several
particular Beings may have a conformity
in them to one general abstract Idea, which
may, if you please, be called their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or <hi>common Nature:</hi> But how that Idea
or general Nature can <hi>be the same and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,</hi>
is still past my Comprehension.</p>
            <p>To my saying, That your Lordship had
not told me what <hi>Nature</hi> is, I am told,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 159.</note>
That <hi>if I had a mind to understand you, I
could not but see,</hi> that by <hi>Nature you meant
the Subject of essential Properties.</hi> A Lady
asking a learned Physician what the Spleen
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:65912:195"/>
was, received this answer, That it was the
Receptacle of the Melancholy Humour:
She had a mind to understand what the
Spleen was; but by this Definition of it,
found her self not much enlightned; and
therefore went on to ask, what the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Humour was; and by the Doctor's
answer, found that the Spleen and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Humour, had a Relation one to
another; but what the Spleen was she knew
not one jot better than she did, before he
told her any thing about it. My Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Definitions of Terms, that are not
relative, usually do no more than lead us
in a Circuit to the same place from whence
we set out; and there leave us in the same
Ignorance we were in at first. So I fear
it would fall out with me here, if I, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
as I am to <hi>understand</hi> what your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
means by <hi>Nature,</hi> should go on to ask
what you mean by <hi>essential Properties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The three or four next Pages<note n="*" place="margin">p. 159-161.</note> I hope
your Lordship does not think contain any
serious Answer to what my Friend said
<note n="†" place="margin">2d Let. p. 132-135.</note> concerning <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> and
as for the Pleasantry of your <hi>Country-man,</hi>
I shall not pretend to meddle with that,
since your Lordship, who knows better than
any body his way of <hi>chopping of Logick,</hi> was
fain to give it off, because it was growing
too rough. What Work such a dangerous
<hi>chopper of Logick</hi> would make, with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that supposed the names <hi>Peter,
Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> to stand for Men; and
then without scruple affirm'd, That the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:65912:195"/>
of Man was in them, if he were let
loose upon it, who can tell? Especially
if he might have the liberty strenuously to
use the Phrase <hi>for his Life,</hi> and to observe
what a turn the chiming of Words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
determined Ideas annexed to them, <hi>give
to the Vnderstanding, when they are gone deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Man's Head,</hi> and pass there for Things.</p>
            <p>To shew that the <hi>common</hi> or general <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man,</hi> could not be in <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Iames,</hi>
I alledg'd, That whatever existed (as what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was in <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Iames</hi> did) was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and that it confounded my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
to make a general a particular.
In answer, your Lordship tells me,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 164.</note> That
to make me understand this, you had told
me in your Answer to my first Letter. <hi>That
we are to consider Beings as God had order'd
them in their several sorts and ranks,</hi> &amp;c. And
thereupon you ask me,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 165.</note> 
               <hi>Why it was not
answer'd in the proper Place for it? Answ.</hi> I
own I am not always so Fortunate, as to
say things in that, which your Lordship
thinks the <hi>proper Place;</hi> but having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
for Repetitions, I thought your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
could not be Ignorant, that I had <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
Beings as God had order'd them in their
several sorts and ranks,</hi> &amp;c. Since you could
not but have read these Words of mine,
<note n="†" place="margin">Essay <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <q>I would not here be thought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
much less to deny, that Nature in
the production of Things, makes seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of them alike. There is nothing
more obvious, especially in the Races of
Animals, and all things Propagated by
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:65912:196"/>
Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And I have expressed my
Sense in this Point, so fully here, and in
other Places, particularly B. 3. C. 6. that
I dare leave it to my Reader, without any
farther Explication.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship farther asks,<note n="†" place="margin">p. 165.</note> 
               <hi>Is not that
a real Nature, which is the Subject of real Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties?
And is not the Nature really in those
who have the essential Properties?</hi> I Answer to
both those Questions yes, such as is the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi>
of the Subject, such is the reality of
its Properties; the abstract general Idea, is
<hi>really</hi> in the Mind of him that has it, and
the Properties that it has are <hi>really</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seperably
annexed to it; let this <hi>reality</hi> be
whatever your Lordship pleases: But this
will never prove, That this general Nature
exists in <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Iames.</hi> Those <hi>Properties,</hi>
with Submission, do not, as your Lordship
supposes, exist in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames:</hi> Those
Qualities indeed may exist in them, which
your Lordship calls <hi>Properties:</hi> But they are
not <hi>Properties</hi> in either of them, but are <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi>
only of that specifick abstract Nature,
which <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> for their supposed
Conformity to it, are ranked under. For
Example, <hi>Rationality</hi> as much a <hi>Property</hi> as
it is of a <hi>Man,</hi> is no <hi>Property</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi> he
was Rational a good part of his Life, could
<hi>Write and Read, and was a sharp Fellow at a
Bargain:</hi> But about Thirty, a knock so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
him, that for these Twenty Years
past, he has <hi>been able to do none of these Things,</hi>
there is to this Day, not so much appearance
of Reason in him, as in his Horse or Monkey:
And yet he is <hi>Peter</hi> still.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:65912:196"/>
Your Lordship asks,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 165.</note> 
               <hi>Is not that a real
Nature, that is the Subject of real Properties?
And is not that Nature really in those who have
the same essential Properties?</hi> Give me leave,
I beseech you, to ask, are not those distinct
real Natures, that are the Subjects of distinct
essential Properties? For Example, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of an Animal, is the <hi>Subject of essential
Properties</hi> of an Animal, with the exclusion of
those of a Man or a Horse; for else the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of an Animal, and the Nature of a Man,
and the Nature of a Horse, would be the same:
And so, wherever the Subject of the essential
Properties of an Animal is, there also would
be the subject of the essential Properties of a
Man, and of a Horse, and so, in effect, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is an Animal, would be a Man: The <hi>real
Nature</hi> of an Animal, and the <hi>real Nature</hi> of a
Man, being the same. To avoid this, there is
no other way (if this reality your Lordship
builds so much on, be any thing beyond the
reality of Two abstract distinct Ideas in
the Mind) but that there be one <hi>real Nature</hi>
of an Animal, the <hi>Subject of the essential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi>
of an Animal; and another <hi>real Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of a Man, <hi>the Subject of the essential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi>
of a Man: Both which <hi>real Natures</hi>
must be in <hi>Peter,</hi> to make him a Man. So
that every individual Man or Beast, must
according to this account, have two <hi>real
Natures</hi> in him, to make him what he is:
Nay, if this be so, Two will not serve the
turn. <hi>Bucephalus</hi> must have the <hi>real Nature</hi>
of <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> and the <hi>real Nature</hi> of <hi>Body,</hi>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:65912:197"/>
and the <hi>real Nature</hi> of <hi>Vivens,</hi> and the real
Nature of <hi>Animal,</hi> and the real Nature of
a <hi>Horse,</hi> i. e Five distinct <hi>real Natures in
him,</hi> to make him <hi>Bucephalus:</hi> For these are
all <hi>really</hi> distinct <hi>common Natures,</hi> whereof
one is not the <hi>Subject</hi> of precisely the same
<hi>essential Properties</hi> as the other. This, though
very hard to my Understanding, must be
really so, if every distinct, <hi>common</hi> or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Nature,</hi> be a <hi>real</hi> Being, that really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists
any where, but in the Understanding.
<hi>Common Nature, taken in my way of Ideas,
your Lordship truly says,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">P. 164.</note> 
               <hi>will not make me
understand such a common Nature as you speak
of, which subsists in several</hi> Individuals, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I can have no Ideas of real Substances,
but such as are particular; all others are only
abstract Ideas, and made only by the act of
the Mind.</hi> But what your Lordship farther
promises there, I find, to my Sorrow, does
not hold, <hi>viz.</hi> That in your Lordship's way
(as far as you have discover'd it) which
you call <hi>the way of Reason, I may come to a
better understanding of this Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship in the next Paragraph<note n="†" place="margin">p. 166.</note>
declares your self <hi>really ashamed to be put to
explain these Things,</hi> that which you had said
being so very plain and easy: And yet I am
not <hi>ashamed</hi> to own, <hi>that for my Life,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
understand them, as they are now far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
explained. Your Lordship thinks it
proved, That every <hi>common Nature</hi> is a <hi>real</hi>
Being: Let it be so, that it is the Subject
of <hi>real Properties;</hi> and that thereby it is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
to be a <hi>real</hi> Being, this makes
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:65912:197"/>
it harder for me to conceive, that this <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Nature of a Man,</hi> which is a <hi>real</hi> Being,
and but one, should yet <hi>be really in Peter,</hi> in
<hi>Iames and in Iohn.</hi> Had <hi>Amphitruo</hi> been
able to conceive this, he had not been so
much puzzel'd, or thought <hi>Sosia</hi> to talk
Idle, when he told him, <hi>Domi ego sum in
quam et apud te adsum Sosia idem.</hi> For the
<hi>common Nature of Man,</hi> is a <hi>real</hi> Being as
your Lordship says, and <hi>Sosia</hi> is no more:
And he that can conceive any <hi>one and the
same real Being,</hi> to be in divers places at
once, can have no difficulty to conceive it
of another <hi>real</hi> Being: And so <hi>Sosia</hi> may
at the same time be at home, and with his
Master abroad. And <hi>Amphitruo</hi> might have
been <hi>ashamed</hi> to demand the explication of
so plain a Matter; or at least, if he had
stuck a little at <hi>here</hi> and <hi>there</hi> too, ought he
not to have been satisfied, as soon as <hi>Sosia</hi>
had told him, <hi>I am another distinct I <hi>here,</hi>
from the same I that I am</hi> there? Which no
doubt <hi>Sosia</hi> could have made out; let your
Lordship's <hi>Countryman chop Logick</hi> with him,
and try whether he cannot. <hi>Countryman.</hi>
But how is it possible <hi>Sosia,</hi> that thou the
<hi>real same,</hi> as thou sayst, should'st be at home,
and here too? <hi>Sosia,</hi> Very easily, because
I am <hi>really</hi> the <hi>same,</hi> and yet <hi>distinct. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trym.</hi>
How can this be? <hi>Sosia,</hi> By a Trick
that I have. <hi>Countrym.</hi> Canst thou teach me
the Trick? <hi>Sosia.</hi> Yes, 'tis but for thee
to get a <hi>particular Subsistence proper to thy real</hi>
self at home, and another <hi>particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
proper</hi> to thy <hi>same real</hi> self abroad,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:65912:198"/>
and the Business is done, thou wilt then
easily be the same <hi>real</hi> thing, and <hi>distinct</hi>
from thy self; and thou mayst be in as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places together, as thou canst get <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Subsistences,</hi> and be still the same one
<hi>real</hi> Being. <hi>Countrym.</hi> But what is that <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Subsistence? Sosia,</hi> Hold ye, Hold ye
Friend, that's the Secret, I thought once,
it was <hi>particular Existence,</hi> but that I find
is an ineffectual Drug, and will not do:
Every one fees it will not make the <hi>same real</hi>
Being <hi>distinct</hi> from it self, nor bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
two different places at once, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is laid aside, and <hi>Subsistence</hi> is taken
to do the Feat. <hi>Countrym.</hi> Existence my
Boy's School master made me understand,
the other Day, when my gray Mare Fol'd.
For he told me that a Horse, that never was
before, began than to exist; and when the
poor Fole died, he told me the same Horse
ceased to exist. <hi>Sosia,</hi> But did he tell thee
what became of the <hi>real common Nature</hi> of
an Horse, that was in it, when the Fole
died? <hi>Countrym.</hi> No. But this I know,
That my <hi>real</hi> Horse was really destroy'd.
<hi>Sosia,</hi> There's now thy Ignorance, so much
of thy Horse as had a <hi>real Existence,</hi> was
really destroy'd, that's true: But there was
something in thy Horse, which having a
real <hi>particular Subsistence</hi> was not destroy'd;
nay, and the best part of thy Horse too,
for it was that, which had in it all those
Properties, that made thy Horse better
than a Broom-stick. <hi>Countrym.</hi> Thou tellst
me Wonders of this same <hi>Subsistence,</hi> what
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:65912:198"/>
I pray thee is it? <hi>Sosia.</hi> I beg your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for that, it is the very Philosopher's
Stone, those who are <hi>Adepti,</hi> and can do
strange things with it, are Wiser than to
tell what it is. <hi>Countrym.</hi> Where may it
be Bought then? <hi>Sosia.</hi> That I know not:
But I will tell thee where thou mayst meet
with it. <hi>Countryman,</hi> Where? <hi>Sosia,</hi> In
some of the shady Thickets of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and 'tis worth the looking after. For
if <hi>particular Subsistence</hi> has such a power over
a <hi>real Being,</hi> as to make one and the <hi>same
real Being</hi> to be <hi>distinct</hi> and in divers places
at once, it may perhaps be able to give thee
an Account what becomes of that <hi>real Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of thy Horse after thy Horse is dead,
and if thou canst but find, whether that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires,
who knows but thou mayst get as
useful a thing as thy Horse again? Since
to that <hi>real Nature</hi> of thy Horse, insepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
adheres the Shape and Motion and
other Properties of thy Horse.</p>
            <p>I hope, my Lord, your <hi>Country-man</hi> will
not be displeased to have met with <hi>Sosia</hi>
to <hi>chop Logick</hi> with, who, I think, has made
it as intelligible, how his <hi>real</hi> self might
be the <hi>same</hi> and <hi>distinct,</hi> and be really in
distinct places at once, by the help of a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Subsistence proper to him</hi> in each place,
as it is intelligible how any <hi>real Being</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of <hi>a common Nature,</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any other name bestowed upon it, may
be the <hi>same</hi> and <hi>distinct;</hi> and <hi>really</hi> be in
diverse places at once, by the help of <hi>a
particular Subsistence proper to each of those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:65912:199"/>
sames.</hi> At least, if I may answer for
my self, I understand one as well as the
other: And if my Head be turned from
<hi>common Sense</hi> (as I find your Lordship very
apt to think) so that it is<note n="†" place="margin">p. 169.</note> 
               <hi>great News to
you that I understand any thing:</hi> If in my
way of Ideas I cannot understand Words,
that appear to me either to stand for no
Ideas; or to be so joined, that they put
inconsistent Ideas together, I think your
Lordship uses me right to turn me off for
desperate, and <hi>leave me, as you do, to the</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">p. 169.</note> 
               <hi>Reader's Vnderstanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To your Lordship's many Questions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Drills,</hi> in the Paragraph
<note n="*" place="margin">P. 169, &amp; 170.</note> where you begin to explain what my
Friend and I found difficult in your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
concerning <hi>Person;</hi> I answer, That
these two <hi>names, Man</hi> and <hi>Drill,</hi> are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<hi>Arbitrary,</hi> whether <hi>founded</hi> on real
<hi>distinct Properties</hi> or no; so perfectly <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi>
that if Men had pleased, <hi>Drill</hi> might
have stood for what <hi>Man</hi> now does, and
<hi>Vice versa.</hi> I answer farther, That these
two Names stand for two abstract Ideas,
which are (to those who know what they
mean by these two Names) the distinct Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences
of two distinct <hi>Kinds;</hi> and as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Existences, or things Existing are
found by Men (who know what they mean
by these Names) to agree to either of those
Ideas, which these Names stand for; these
Names respectively are applied to those
particular things, and the things said to
be of that <hi>Kind.</hi> This I have so fully and
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:65912:199"/>
at large explained in my <hi>Essay,</hi> that I should
have thought it needless to have said any
thing again of it here, had it not been to
shew my readiness to answer any Questions
you shall be pleased to ask concerning any
thing I have writ, which your Lordship
either finds difficult, or has forgot.</p>
            <p>In the next place, your Lordship comes to
dear what you had said in answer to this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
put by your self,<note n="†" place="margin">Vindie. p. 259.</note> 
               <hi>What is this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> founded
upon?</hi> To which you answered,<note n="*" place="margin">ibid.</note> 
               <hi>That they
may be distinguished from each other by our
Senses, as to difference of Features, distance
of Place,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But that is not all; for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
there was no external difference, yet there
is a difference between them, as several Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals
in the same common Nature.</hi> These
Words, when my Friend and I came to
consider, we owned, as your Lordship here
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 171.</note> takes notice, that we could understand no
more by them but this, <q>That the ground
of Distinction between several Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
in the same common Nature, is,
That they are several Individuals in the
same common Nature.</q> Hereupon your
Lordship tells me,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 171.</note> 
               <hi>The Question now is,
what this distinction is founded upon? Whether
on our observing the difference of Features, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Place,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or on some antecedent
ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pursuant hereunto, as if this were
the Question, you in the next Paragraph
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 171.</note> (as far as I can understand it) make
<hi>the ground of the Distinction between these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals</hi>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:65912:200"/>
or the <hi>principium individuationis,</hi> to
be the <hi>Vnion of the Soul and Body.</hi> But
with Submission, my Lord, the Question is,
Whether I and my Friend were to blame,
because when your Lordship, in the Words
above cited, having removed all other
grounds of Distinction, said <hi>there was yet
a difference between</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> James, <hi>as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Individuals in the same common Nature,</hi>
we could understand no more by it, but
this, <q>That the ground of Distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
several Individuals in the same
common Nature, is, That they are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Individuals in the same common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let the ground that your Lordship now
assigns of the Distinction of Individuals be
what it will, or let what you say be as
clear as you please, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the ground of
their Distinction</hi> is in <hi>the Vnion of Soul and
Body;</hi> it will, I humbly conceive, be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
true, That what you said before
might amount to no more but this, <q>That
the ground of the Distinction between
several Individuals in the same common
Nature, is, That they are several Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals
in the same common Nature;</q>
and therefore we might not be to blame
for so understanding it. For the Words,
which our Understandings were then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied
about, were those which you had
there said, and not those which you would
say five Months after: Though I must own,
that those which your Lordship here<note n="*" place="margin">p. 171-173.</note> says
concerning the <hi>Distinction of Individuals,</hi>
               <pb n="367" facs="tcp:65912:200"/>
leave it as much in the dark to me as what
you said before. But perhaps I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
your Lordship's Words right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I conceive that the <hi>principium indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duationis</hi>
is the same in all the several Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Creatures, Men as well as Others;
and therefore if the <hi>Vnion of Soul and Body</hi>
be that which distinguishes two Individuals
in the Humane Species one from another,
I know not how two Cheries or two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
of Matter can be distinct Individuals;
since I think there is in them no <hi>Vnion of
a Soul and Body.</hi> And upon this ground
it will be very hard to tell, what made the
<hi>Soul</hi> and the <hi>Body, Individuals</hi> (as certainly
they were) before their Union.</p>
            <p>But I shall leave what your Lordship says
concerning this Matter to the Examination
of those, whose Health and Leisure allows
them more time than I have for this weighty
Question, wherein the Distinction of two
Men or two Cheries consists, for fear I
should make your Lordship's <hi>Country-man</hi>
a little wonder again to find a <hi>grave Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
make a serious Question of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To your next Paragraph<note n="†" place="margin">p. 173-174.</note> I answer,
That if the <hi>true Idea of a Person,</hi> or the
true Signification of the Word Person <hi>lies
in this,</hi> That <hi>supposing</hi> there was no other
<hi>difference in the several Individuals of the same
kind;</hi> yet there is <hi>a difference between them
as several Individuals in the same common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
it will follow from hence, that the
name <hi>Person</hi> will agree to <hi>Bucephalus</hi> and
<hi>Podargus,</hi> as well as to <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</hi>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:65912:201"/>
But whether this Consequence will
agree, with what your Lordship says con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Person</hi> in another place, I am not
concerned; I am only answerable for this
Consequence.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship is pleased here,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 173.</note> to call
my endeavour to find out the meaning of
your Words, as you had put them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>trifling Exceptions:</hi> To which I must
say, That I am heartily sorry, that either
my Understanding, or your Lordship's way
of Writing obliges me so often to such
<hi>trifling.</hi> I cannot, as I have said, answer
to what I do not understand; and I hope
here my <hi>trifling,</hi> in searching out your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
meaning, was not much out of the
way, because I think every one will see by
the Steps I took, that the Sense I found out
by it, was that which your Words implied;
and your Lordship does not disown it, but
only replys, That I should not have drawn
that which was the natural Consequence
from it, because that Consequence would
not well consist with what you had said
in another place.</p>
            <p>What your Lordship adds farther<note n="†" place="margin">p. 174 175.</note> to
clear your saying, <hi>That an individual intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Substance is rather supposed to the making
of a Person, than the proper definition of it,</hi>
though in your definition of <hi>Person,</hi> you
put <hi>a compleat intelligent Substance,</hi> must have
its effect upon others Understandings: I
must suffer under the short sightedness of
my own, who neither understood it as it
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65912:201"/>
stood in your first Answer, nor do I now as
it is explained in your second.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship being here, as you say,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 176.</note>
come to the end of this Debate, I should
here have ended too; and it was time, my
Letter being grown already to too great a
Bulk. But I being ingaged by Promise, to
Answer some Things in your first Letter,
which in my Reply to it, I had omitted, I
now come to them, and shall endeavour to
give your Lordship satisfaction in those
Points; tho to make room for them, I leave
out a great deal that I had Writ in Answer
to this your Lordship's Second Letter. And
if after all, my Answer seems too long, I
must beg your Lordship, and my Reader, to
excuse it, and impute it to those occasions of
length, which I have mentioned in more
places than one, as they have occurred.</p>
            <p>The Original and main Question between
your Lordship, and me, being, whether there
were any thing in my Essay, Repugnant to
the Doctrin of the Trinity; I endeavoured,
by Examining the Grounds and manner of
your Lordship's bringing my Book into that
Controversie, to bring that Question to a
Decision. And therefore in my Answer to
your Lordship's First Letter, I insisted par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
on what had a Relation to that
Point. This Method your Lordship in your
Second Letter Censured, as if it Contained
only <hi>Personal Matters,</hi> which were fit to be
laid aside. And by mixing new Matter, and
charging my Book with new Accusations,
before the first was made out, avoided the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:65912:202"/>
Decision of what was in Debate between us;
A strong Presumption to me, that your
Lordship had little to say, to support what
began the Controversy, which you were so
willing to have me let fall; whilest on the
other side, my Silence to other Points, which
I had Promised an Answer to, was often Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
on, and I Rebuked, for not Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>in the proper Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship's calling upon me on this
occasion shall not be lost; 'Tis fit your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
should be satisfied, and your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
Considered; which for the Reasons
above mentioned, were not Examined in
my former Answer. And which, whether
true or false, as I humbly conceive, make
nothing for or against the Doctrin of the
Trinity. I shall therefore consider them
barely as so many Philosophical Questions,
and endeavour to shew your Lordship where,
and upon what Grounds 'tis I Stick; and
what it is, that hinders me from the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
it would be to me, to be in every one
of them of your mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordship tells me,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 7.</note> Whether I do
own Substance or not, is not the Point before us;
But whether by Vertue of these Principles, I can
come to any certainty of Reason about it? And
your Lordship says, the very Places I produce do
prove the Contrary; which you shall therefore set
Down in my own Words, both as to Corporeal and
Spiritual Substances.</p>
            <p>Here again my Lord, I must beg your
Pardon, that I do not distinctly Comprehend
your meaning in these Words, <hi>viz. That by
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:65912:202"/>
vertue of these Principles one cannot come to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Reason about Substance:</hi> For it is not
very clear to me, whether your Lordship
means, that we cannot <hi>come to certainty,</hi> that
there is such a thing in the World as <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;</hi>
or, whether we cannot make any
other Proposition about <hi>Substance,</hi> of which
we can be <hi>certain;</hi> or whether we cannot by
my Principles, Establish any Idea of <hi>Substance</hi>
of which we can be <hi>certain.</hi> For to come to
<hi>Certainty of Reason, about Substance</hi> may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
either of these, which are far different
Propositions: And I shall waste your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
time, my Readers, and my own (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of which would I willingly do) by
taking it in one Sense, when you mean it in
an other, lest I should meet with some such
Reproof as this: That I <hi>Misrepresent your
meaning, or might have understood it if I had a
mind to it,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore cannot but
wish, that you had so far Condescended to
the slowness of my Apprehension, as to give
me your Sense to determined, that I might not
trouble you with Answers to what was not
your Precise meaning.</p>
            <p>To avoid it in the present Case, and to
find in what Sense I was here to take these
words, <hi>come to no Certainty of Reason about
Substance,</hi> I looked into what followed,
and when I came to the 13th Page, I
thought I had there got a clear explication
of your Lordship's Meaning, and that by
<hi>no Certainty of Reason about Substance,</hi> your
Lordship here meant <hi>no certain Idea of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi>
Your Lordship's words are<note n="*" place="margin">1. Ans. p. 13.</note> 
               <hi>I do
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:65912:203"/>
not charge them,</hi> (i. e. me as one of the
Gentlemen of the new way of Reasoning)
<hi>with Discarding the Notion of Substance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have but an imperfect Idea of it; but
because upon those Principles, there can be <hi>no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Idea</hi> at all of it.</hi> Here I thought my self
sure, and that these words plainly Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the meaning of your Proposition, p. 7. to
be, <hi>that upon my Principles there can be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Idea at all of Substance.</hi> But before I
came to the end of that Paragraph, I found
my self at a loss again, for that Paragraph
goes on in these words,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Whereas your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
asserts it to be one of the most natural and
certain Ideas in our minds, because it is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance
to our first Conception of Things, that
Modes or Accidents should subsist by themselves,
and therefore you said the rational Idea of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is one of the first Ideas in our Minds; and
however imperfect and obscure our Notion be, yet
we are as <hi>certain</hi> that Substances <hi>are</hi> and must
<hi>be</hi> as that there are any Beings in the World.</hi>
Here the <hi>Certainty</hi> which your words seem
to mean, is <hi>Certainty of the Being of Substance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Sense therefore I shall take it, till
your Lordship shall determine it otherwise.
And the reason why I take it so is, because
what your Lordship goes on to say,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 7. 8.</note> seems
to me to look most that way. The Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
then that your Lordship undertakes to
Prove is this; <hi>That by Vertue of my Principles
we cannot come to any Certainty of Reason, that
there is any such thing as Substance.</hi> And your
Lordship tells me,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 7.</note> 
               <hi>That the very Places I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
do prove the Contrary, which you therefore
will set down in my own Words, both as to Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
and Spiritual Substances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:65912:203"/>
The First your Lordship brings<note n="*" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 6.</note> are
these words of mine: <q>When we talk or
think of any Particular sort of Corporeal
Substances, as Horse, Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tho'
the Idea we have of either of them, be
but the Complication or Collection of
those several simple Ideas of sensible quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which we use to find United in the thing
called Horse or Stone; yet because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive how they should subsist alone;
nor one in another, we suppose them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting
in, and supported by some common
Subject, which support we denote by the
Name Substance; tho' it be certain we
have no clear and distinct Idea of that
thing we suppose a Support.</q>And again,</p>
            <p>
               <q>The same happens concerning the
Operations of the Mind, <hi>viz.</hi> Thinking,
Reasoning, Fearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
not to subsist of themselves, nor
apprehending how they can belong to
Body, or be produced by it, we are apt
to think these the Actions of some other
Substance, which we call Spirit, whereby
yet it is evident that having no other Idea
or Notion of Matter, but something
wherein those many Sensible Qualities,
which affect our Senses do subsist; by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
a Substance, wherein Thinking,
Knowing, Doubting, and a Power of Mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> do subsist. We have as clear a
Notion of the Nature or Substance of
Spirit, as we have of Body; the one being
supposed to be (without knowing what it
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:65912:204"/>
is) the <hi>Substratum</hi> to those simple Ideas we
have from without; and the other suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
(with a like Ignorance of what it is)
to be the <hi>Substratum</hi> to those Operations
which we Experiment in our selves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But how these words prove that, <hi>upon my
Principles we cannot come to any Certainty of
Reason that there is any such thing as Substance
in the World;</hi> I confess I do not see, nor has
your Lordship, as I humbly, conceive shewn.
And I think it would be a hard matter from
these Words of mine to make a Syllogism,
whose Conclusion should be, Ergo, <hi>from my
Principles we cannot come to any Certainty of
Reason, that there is any Substance in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship indeed tells me<note n="*" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 9.</note> that I say,
<q>that these and the like fashions of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Substance is always supposed
something.</q> 
               <hi>And grant that I say over and
over <hi>that Substance is supposed;</hi>
               </hi> but <hi>that</hi> your
Lordship says, <hi>is not what you looked for,
but something in the way of Certainty by Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What your Lordship looks for, is not, I
find, always easy for me to guess. But
what I brought that, and some other Passages
to the same purpose for, out of my Essay,
that I think they prove, <hi>viz.</hi> that I did not
<hi>Discard</hi> nor <hi>almost Discard Substance out of
the Reasonable part of the World.</hi> For he
that supposes in every Species of Material
Beings, Substance to be always something,
doth not <hi>Discard</hi> or <hi>almost Discard</hi> it out of
the World, or deny any such thing to be.
The Passages alledged I think prove this,
which was all I brought them for. And if
they should happen to prove no more, I
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:65912:204"/>
think, you can hardly infer from thence,
That therefore <hi>upon my Principles, we can
come to no Certainty, that there is any such thing
as Substance in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship goes on<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 9.</note> to insist mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon my <hi>supposing;</hi> and to these Words
of mine, <q>We cannot conceive how these
sensible Qualities should subsist alone;
and therefore we suppose a Substance to
support them.</q> Your Lordship replies,
<hi>It is but supposing still; because we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it otherwise: But what Certainty follows
from not being barely able to conceive? Answer.</hi>
The same <hi>Certainty</hi> that <hi>follows from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy
to our first Conceptions of things,</hi>
upon which<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 25.</note> your Lordship grounds the
relative Idea of Substance. Your Words
are, <hi>It is a mere effect of Reason, because it
is a Repugnancy to our first Conceptions of things,
that Modes or Accidents should subsist by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
Your Lordship then, if I understand
your Reasoning here, concludes, That there
is Substance, <hi>because it is a Repugnancy to our
Conceptions of things</hi> (for whether that <hi>Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy</hi>
be to our first or second Conceptions, I
think that's all one) <hi>that Modes or Accidents
should subsist by themselves;</hi> and I conclude the
same thing, because we cannot conceive how
sensible Qualities should subsist by themselves.
Now what the difference of <hi>Certainty</hi> is
from <hi>a Repugnancy to our Conceptions,</hi> and
from our not being able to conceive; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
my Lord, I am not acute enough to
discern. And therefore it seems to me,
that I have laid down the same <hi>Certainty</hi> of
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:65912:205"/>
the Being of Substance, that your Lordship
has done.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship adds,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Are there not mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of things which we are not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
and yet it would not be allowed us to
suppose what we think fit upon that account?
Answer.</hi> Your Lordship's is certainly a very
just Rule; 'tis pity it does not reach the
Case. <hi>But because it is not allowed us to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
what we think fit in things, which we are
not able to conceive;</hi> it does not therefore
follow, That we may not with Certainty
suppose or infer, that which is a natural and
undeniable Consequence of such an inability
to conceive, as I call it, or <hi>repugnancy to our
Conception,</hi> as you call it. We cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Foundation of <hi>Harlem</hi> Church to
stand upon nothing; but because it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
us to suppose what we think fit, <hi>viz.</hi>
That it is laid upon a Rock of Diamond,
or supported by Fairies; yet I think all the
World will allow the infallible Certainty
of this Supposition, from thence, that it
rests upon something. This I take to be
the present Case; and therefore your next
Words, I think, do less concern Mr. <hi>L.</hi>
than my Lord B. of <hi>W.</hi> I shall set them
down, that the Reader may apply them to
which of the two he thinks they most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.
They are,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 9.</note> 
               <hi>I could hardly conceive
that Mr. <hi>L.</hi> would have brought such Evidence
as this against himself; but I must suppose some
unknown</hi> Substratum <hi>in this Case.</hi> For these
Words, that your Lordship has last quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of mine, do not only not prove, That
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:65912:205"/>
               <hi>upon my Principles we cannot come to any Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
that there is any such thing as Substance
in the World;</hi> but prove the contrary, that
there must certainly be Substance in the
World, and upon the very same Grounds,
that your Lordship takes it to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>Your next Paragraph,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 10.</note> which is to the
same purpose, I have read more than once,
and can never forbear, as often as I read
it, to wish my self young again; or that
a liveliness of Fancy suitable to that Age,
would teach me to sport with Words for
the Diversion of my Readers. This I find
your Lordship thinks so necessary to the
quickning of Controversie, that you will
not trust the Debate to the greatness of your
Learning, nor the gravity of your Subject
without it, whatever Authority the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of your Character might give to what your
Lordship says; for you<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 10.</note> having quoted
these Words of mine; <q>As long as there
is any simple Idea, or sensible Quality left,
according to my way of Arguing, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
cannot be discarded, because all
simple Ideas, all sensible Qualities <hi>carry</hi>
with them a Supposition of a Substratum
to Exist in, and a Substance wherein they
inhere.</q> You add, <hi>What is the meaning
of carrying</hi> with them a Supposition of a
Substratum and a Substance? <hi>Have these</hi> sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Ideas <hi>the Notion of a</hi> Substance <hi>in them?
No,</hi> but they carry it with them: <hi>How so?
Do</hi> sensible Qualities carry a Corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<hi>along with them? Then</hi> a Corporeal
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:65912:206"/>
Substance <hi>must be</hi> intromitted <hi>by the Senses
together with them: No, but they carry</hi> the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
with them; <hi>and truly that is burden
enough for them. But which may do they carry
it? It seems its only,</hi> because we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it otherwise: <hi>What is this</hi> Conceiving?
<hi>It may be said it is</hi> an Act of the Mind,
<hi>not built on simple Ideas, but lies in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the Ideas of Accident and Substance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and from thence finding that an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
must carry Substance along with it: But
this will not clear it; for the Ideas</hi> of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<hi>are</hi> simple Ideas, <hi>and carry nothing
along with them, but the impression made by
sensible Objects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Passage, I conclude, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
had some regard to the Entertainment
of that part of your Readers, who would
be thought Men, as well by being risible
as rational Creatures. For I cannot imagine
you meant this for an Argument; if you
did, I have this plain simple answer, That
by <hi>carrying with them a Supposition,</hi> I mean,
according to the ordinary import of the
Phrase, That sensible Qualities imply a
<hi>Substratum</hi> to Exist in. And if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
please to change one of these equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Expressions into the other, all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
here, I think, will be at an end:
What will become of the Sport and Smiling,
I will not answer.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, I do not see any thing in my
Words brought by your Lordship that
proves, <hi>That upon my Principles we can come
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:65912:206"/>
to no Certainty of Reason, that there is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in the World,</hi> but the contrary.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's next Words<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 11, 12.</note> are to
tell the World that my Simile about the
Elephant and Tortoise, <hi>is to ridicule the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Substance, and the</hi> Europaean <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
for asserting it.</hi> But if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
please to turn again to my <hi>Essay,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">B. 2. C. 13. § 19.</note>
you will find those Passages were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to ridicule the <hi>Notion of Substance,</hi>
or those who <hi>asserted it,</hi> whatever that it
signifies. But to shew, that though <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
did support Accidents, yet Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
who had found such a support ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
had no more a clear Idea of what,
that support was, than the <hi>Indian</hi> had of
that, which supported his Tortoise, tho'
sure he was, it was something. Had your
Pen which<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 11.</note> quoted so much of the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Sect. of the thirteenth Chap. of my
second Book, but set down the remaining
line and an half of that Paragraph, you
would by these Words which follow there;
<q>So that of Substance we have no Idea
of what it is, but only a confused ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
one of what it does,</q> have put
it past doubt, what I meant. But your
Lordship was pleased to take only those,
which you thought would serve best to
your purpose; And I crave leave to add
now these remaining ones to shew my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what was <hi>mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis to the same purpose I use the same
Illustration again in that other place,<note n="*" place="margin">B. 2. C. 23. § 2.</note>
which you are pleased to cite likewise, which
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:65912:207"/>
your Lordship says you did, <hi>only to shew, that
it was a deliberate and (as I thought) lucky simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</hi>
It was upon serious consideration I
own, that I entertained the Opinion, that
we had no clear and distinct Idea of <hi>Substance.</hi>
But as to that <hi>Similitude,</hi> I do not remember
that it was much deliberated on: Such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accurate
Writers as I am, who aim at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but plainness, do not much study
Similes: And for the <hi>Fault of Repetition</hi> you
have been pleased to Pardon it. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
you had proved, That that Simile
was to <hi>ridicule the Notion of Substance,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
in the Writings of some Europaean
Philosophers; it will by no means follow
from thence, That <hi>upon my Principles we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come to any Certainty of Reason, that there
is any such thing as Substance in the World.</hi>
Men's Notions of a thing may be laughed
at by those, whose Principles establish the
Certainty of the thing it self; and one may
laugh at <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Notion of an Orb of
Fire under the Sphere of the Moon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Principles that will make him uncertain
whether there be any such thing as Fire.
<hi>My Simile</hi> did perhaps serve to shew, that
there were Philosophers, whose Knowledge
was not so clear, nor so great as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
If your Lordship thereupon thought,
that the vanity of such a pretension had
something ridiculous in it, I shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
your Judgment in the Case: For, as
humane Nature is framed, 'tis not impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that whoever is discovered to pretend
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:65912:207"/>
to know more than really he does, will be
in danger to be laughed at.</p>
            <p>In the next Paragraph,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 12.</note> your Lordship
bestows the Epithite of <hi>Dull</hi> on <hi>Burgersdicius</hi>
and <hi>Sanderson and the Tribe of Logicians.</hi> I
will not Question your right to call any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Dull</hi> whom you please. But if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
does it to insinuate, that I did so; I
hope I may be allowed to say thus much in
my own Defence, that I am neither so Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
or Ill-natured to discredit those whom
I quote for being of the same Opinion with
me. And he that will look into the eleventh
and twelfth Pages of my <hi>Reply,</hi> which your
Lordship refers to, will find, that I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
far from calling them <hi>Dull,</hi> or speaking
diminishingly of them. But if I had been
so Ill-bred or Foolish as to have called them
<hi>Dull;</hi> I do not see how that does at all
serve to prove this Proposition; That <hi>upon
my Principles we can come to no Certainty of
Reason, that there is any such thing as Substance</hi>
any more than what follows in the next
Paragraph<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 13.</note>.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship in it asks me, as if it were
of some great importance to the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be proved, whether <hi>there be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the bare being of a thing, and
its Subsistence by its self.</hi> I answer, Yes, there
is a difference as I understand those Terms,
and then I beseech your Lordship to make
use of it to prove the Proposition before
us. But because you seem by this Question
to conclude, That the Idea of a <hi>thing that
subsists by its self,</hi> is a clear and distinct Idea
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:65912:208"/>
of <hi>Substance;</hi> I beg leave to ask, Is the Idea
of the manner of <hi>Subsistence</hi> of a thing, the
<hi>Idea</hi> of the thing it self? If it be not, we
may have a clear and distinct Idea of the
manner, and yet have none but a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and confused one of the thing. For
Example, I tell your Lordship, that I know
a thing, that cannot subsist without a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and I know another thing that does
subsist without a support, and say no more
of them, can you by having the clear and
distinct Ideas of having a support, and not
having a support, say, that you have a clear
and distinct Idea of the thing, that I know
which has, and of the thing, That I know
which has not a support? If your Lordship
can, I beseech you to give me the clear and
distinct Ideas of these, which I only call by
the general name <hi>Things,</hi> that have or have
not supports; for such there are, and such
I shall give your Lordship clear and distinct
Ideas of, when you shall please to call upon
me for them, though I think your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
will scarce find them by the general
and confused Idea of <hi>Thing,</hi> nor in the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and more distinct Idea of having or not
having a support.</p>
            <p>To shew a blind Man that he has no clear
and distinct Idea of Scarlet, I tell him, that
his Notion of it, that it is a <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi>
does not prove he has any clear or distinct
Idea of it; but barely that he takes it to
be <hi>something,</hi> he knows not what. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
that he knows more than that, <hi>v. g.</hi>
he knows that it subsists or inheres in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:65912:208"/>
thing, <hi>And is there no difference,</hi> says he
in your Lordship's Words, <hi>between the bare
being of a thing and its subsistence in another?</hi>
Yes say I to him, a great deal, they are very
different Ideas. But for all that, you have
noclear and distinct Idea of <hi>Scarlet,</hi> not such
a one as I have who see and know it, and
have another kind of Idea of it besides that
of inherence.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship has the Idea <hi>of Subsisting
by it self,</hi> and therefore you conclude you
have a clear and distinct Idea of the thing,
that <hi>subsists by it self,</hi> which methinks is all
one, as if your Countryman should say, he
hath an Idea of a Cedar of Lebanon, that
it is a Tree of a Nature, to need no Prop
to lean on for its support, therefore he
hath a clear and distinct Idea of a Cedar of
Lebanon: Which clear and distinct Idea,
when he comes to examin, is nothing but
a general one of a Tree with which his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined
Idea of a Cedar is confounded.
Just so is the Idea of <hi>Substance,</hi> which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
called clear and distinct is confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the general indetermined Idea of
<hi>Something.</hi> But suppose that the manner of
Subsisting by it self, give us a clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Idea of <hi>Substance,</hi> how does that prove,
That <hi>upon my Principles we can come to no Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Reason, that there is any such thing
as Substance in the World?</hi> Which is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to be proved.</p>
            <p>In what follows,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 13.</note> your Lordship says,
<hi>You do not charge any one with discarding the
Notion of Substance, because he has but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:65912:209"/>
Idea of it: But because upon those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
there can be no certain Idea at all of
it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Lordship says, here, <hi>those Principles</hi>
and in other places <hi>these <hi>Principles,</hi>
               </hi> without
particularly setting them down, that I know:
I am sure without laying down Propositions,
that are mine, and proving, that those
granted, <hi>we cannot come to any Certainty,
that there is any such thing as Substance,</hi> which
is the thing to be proved, your Lordship
proves nothing in the Case against me.
What therefore the <hi>certain Idea,</hi> which I do
not understand, or <hi>Idea</hi> of Substance has to
do here, is not easy to see. For that which
I am charged with, is the <hi>discarding Substance.</hi>
But the <hi>discarding Substance.</hi> is not the <hi>discard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Notion of Substance.</hi> Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> has
discarded <hi>Des Cartes's Vortices,</hi> i. e. laid down
Principles from which he proves there is no
such thing; but he has not thereby discarded
the <hi>Notion</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> of those <hi>Vortices,</hi> for that
he had when he confuted their Being, and
every one who now reads and understands
him, will have. But, as I have already observed,
your Lordship here, I know not upon what
Ground, nor with what Intention, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
the <hi>Idea of Substance</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> it
self; for to the Words above set down,
your Lordship subjoins,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 13.14.</note> 
               <hi>That you assert
it to be one of the most natural and certain Ideas
in our Minds, because it is a repugnance to our
first conception of Things, that Modes or Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
should subsist by themselves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Lordship said, the rational Idea of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:65912:209"/>
is one of the first Ideas in our Minds,
and however imperfect and obscure our Notion
be, yet we are as certain that <hi>Substances are
and must be,</hi> as that there <hi>are</hi> any Beings in
the World.</hi> Herein I tell your Lordship that
I agree with you, and therefore I hope this
is no Objection against the Trinity. <hi>Your
Lordship says, you never thought it was, but to
lay all Foundations of Certainty as to matters
of Faith, upon clear and distinct Ideas, which
was the Opinion you opposed, does certainly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all Mysteries of Faith, and excludes the
Notion of Substance out of rational Discourse,
which</hi> your Lordship affirms <hi>to have been your
Meaning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How these Words, <hi>as to Matters of Faith,</hi>
came in, or what they had to do against me in
an answer only to me, I do not see: Neither
will I here examin what it is to be <hi>one of the
most natural and certain Ideas in our Minds.</hi>
But be it what it will, this I am sure, That
neither that, nor any thing else contained in
this Paragraph, any way proves, that <hi>upon
my Principles we cannot come to any Certainty,
that there is any such thing as Substance in the
World.</hi> Which was the Proposition to be
proved.</p>
            <p>In the next place then, I crave leave to
consider, how that is proved, which though
nothing to the Proposition to be proved, is
yet what you here assert, <hi>viz. That the Idea
of Substannce is one of the most natural and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Ideas in our Minds:</hi> Your Proof of it is
this, <hi>Because it is a repugnancy to our first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of Things, that Modes and Accidents
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:65912:210"/>
should subsist by themselves, and therefore the
rational Idea of Substance is one of the first Ideas
in our Minds.</hi> From whence I grant it to
be a good consequence, that to those who
find this <hi>repugnance,</hi> the Idea of a support is
very necessary, or if you please to call it
so, very <hi>rational.</hi> But a clear and distinct
Idea of the thing it self, which is the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
will not thence be proved to be one
of the <hi>first Ideas in our Minds;</hi> or that any
such Idea is ever there at all. He that is
satisfied that <hi>Pendennis</hi> Castle, if it were
not supported, would fall into the Sea,
must think of a support, that sustains it:
But whether the thing that it rests on be
Timber, or Brick, or Stone, he has by his
bare Idea of the necessity of some support
that props it up, no clear and distinct Idea
at all.</p>
            <p>In this Paragraph you farther say, <hi>That
the laying all foundation of Certainty as to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith on clear and distinct Ideas, does
certainly exclude the Notion of Substance out
of rational Discourse. Answ.</hi> This is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that will need a Proof: Because
every Body at first sight will think it hard
to be proved. For it is obvious, That let
<hi>Certainty in matters of Faith,</hi> or any matters
whatsoever, be laid on what it will, it <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
not the Notion of Substance certainly out
of rational Discourse,</hi> unless it be certainly
true, that we can <hi>rationally Discourse</hi> of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but what we certainly know. But
whether it be a Proposition easy or not easy
to be proved, this is certain, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:65912:210"/>
not me, for I <hi>lay not all Foundation of
Certainty as to matters of Faith, upon clear and
distinct Ideas;</hi> and therefore, if it does dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card
<hi>Substance out of the reasonable part of the
World,</hi> as your Lordship phrases it above,
or <hi>excludes the Notion of Substance out of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Discourse:</hi> Whatever havock it makes
of <hi>Substance,</hi> or its <hi>Idea,</hi> no one jot of the
Mischief is to be laid at my Door, because
that is no Principle of mine.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship ends this Paragraph with
telling me,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 14.</note> that <hi>I at length apprehend your
Lordships meaning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wish heartily that I did, because it would
be much more for your ease as well as my
own. For in this case of <hi>Substance,</hi> I find it
not easy to know your <hi>meaning,</hi> or what it is
I am blamed for. For in the beginning of
this Dispute,<note n="†" place="margin">Vir dic. P. 236.</note> it is the <hi>being of Substance.</hi>
And here again,<note n="*" place="margin">p. 7.</note> it is <hi>Substance</hi> it self, is
<hi>Discarded.</hi> And in this very Paragraph,
<note n="†" place="margin">p. 13. 14.</note> writ as it seems, to explain your self, so
that in the close of it you tell me that at <hi>length
I apprehend your meaning to be that the Notion of
Substance is Excluded out of Rational Discourse,</hi>
the Explication is such, that it renders your
Lordship's meaning to me more obscure and
uncertain, than it was before. For in the
same Paragraph your Lordship says, That
<hi>upon my Principles there can be no certain</hi> Idea
<hi>at all of Substance;</hi> and also that <hi>however im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
and obscure our Notions be, yet we are as
certain that Substances are and must be, as that
there are any <hi>beings</hi> in the World.</hi> So that
supposing I did know (as I do not) what
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:65912:211"/>
your Lordship means by <hi>certain <hi>Idea of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
               </hi>
yet I must own still, that what <hi>your
meaning</hi> is by <hi>discarding</hi> of <hi>Substance,</hi> whether
it be the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Substance,</hi> or the <hi>Being</hi> of
Substance I doe not know. But that, I think,
need not much trouble me, since your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
does not, that I see, shew how any Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Principle of mine overthrows either
<hi>Substance</hi> it self, or the <hi>Idea</hi> of it, or excludes
either of them <hi>out of rational Discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In your next Paragraph,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 14.</note> you say, <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,</hi>
p. 35. <hi>That if any one assert that we can
have no Ideas but from Sensation and Reflection
it is not my Opinion.</hi> My Lord, I have looked
over that 35th Page, and find no such Words
of mine there. But refer my Reader to
that and the following Pages, for my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning Ideas from Sensation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
how far they are the foundation
and materials of all our Knowledge: And
this I do, because to those Words, which
your Lordship has set down as mine, out
of the 35th Page, but are not there, you
subjoin,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 14.</note> That <hi>you are very glad of it, and
will do me all the right you can in this Matter,</hi>
which seems to imply, That it is a matter
of great consequence, and therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
my meaning may be taken in my own
Words, as they are set down at large<note n="*" place="margin">1 Let. p. 35-38.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Promise your Lordship makes me,
<hi>of doing me all the Right you can,</hi> I return my
humble Thanks for, because it is a piece of
Justice so seldom done in Controversie. And
because I suppose you have here made me this
Promise, to Authorise me to mind you of it,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:65912:211"/>
if at any time your haste should make you
mistake my Words or meaning: To have
ones Words exactly Quoted, and their
meaning Interpreted by the plain and visible
design of the Author in his whole Discourse
being <hi>a right,</hi> which every Writer has a just
Claim to, and such as a lover of Truth
will be very wary of Violating. An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of some sort of Intrenchment on this
I humbly conceive there is in the next Page
but one,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 16.</note> where you Interpret my Words,
as if I excused a mistake I had made, by
calling it a slip of my Pen; whereas my Lord,
I do not own any slip of my Pen in that
Place, but say that the meaning of my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
there is to be Interpreted by other
places, and particularly by those, where I
Treat Professedly of that Subject: And that
in such cases, where an Expression is only
incident to the Matter in Hand, and may
seem not exactly to Quadrate with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
Sense, where he designedly treats of
that Subject, it ought rather to be Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as a slip of his Pen, than as his meaning.
I should not have taken so particular a notice
of this, but that you by having up these
Words with an Air that makes me sensible
how wary I ought to be, shew what use
would be made of it, if ever I had pleaded
<hi>the slip of my Pen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the following Pages,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 15-29.</note> I find a Discourse
drawn up under several Ranks of Numbers
to prove, as I guess, this Proposition,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 20.</note> that
<hi>in my way of Ideas we cannot come to any Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
as to the Nature of Substance.</hi> I shall
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:65912:212"/>
be in a condition to Answer to this Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when I shall be told what particular
Proposition, <hi>as to the Nature of Substance,</hi>
it is, which <hi>in my way of Ideas we cannot come
to any Certainty of.</hi> Because probably it may
be such a Proposition concerning the Nature
of Substance, as I shall readily own, that
<hi>in my way of Ideas we can come to no Certainty
of;</hi> and yet I think the way of Ideas not at
all to be blamed, till there can be shewn an
other way, different from that of Ideas,
whereby we may come to a <hi>Certainty</hi> of it.
For 'twas never pretended, that by Ideas we
could come to Certainty concerning every
Proposition, that could be made concerning
Substance or any thing else.</p>
            <p>Besides the doubtfulness visible in the
Phrase it self, there is another Reason that
hinders me from understanding precisely
what is meant by these Words <hi>to come to a
Certainty as to the Nature of Substance,</hi> viz.
Because your Lordship<note n="*" place="margin">p 100 &amp; 101.</note> makes <hi>Nature</hi> and
<hi>Substance</hi> to be <hi>the same,</hi> so that to <hi>come to a
Certainty as to the Nature of Substance</hi> is,
in your Lordship's Sense of <hi>Nature, to come
to a Certainty as to the Substace of Substance,</hi>
which I own I do not clearly understand.</p>
            <p>An other thing that hinders me from giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
particular Answers to the Arguments,
that may be supposed to be contained in so
many Pages is, that I do not see, how what
is Discoursed in those Thirteen or Fourteen
Pages is brought to prove this Proposition,
<hi>that in my way of Ideas we cannot come to any
Certainty as to the Nature of Substance;</hi> and
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:65912:212"/>
it would require too many Words to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
every one of those Heads, Period by
Period, to see what they Prove; when you
your self do not apply them to the direct
Probation of any Proposition that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
            <p>Indeed you wind up this Discourse with
these Words,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. P. 29.</note> 
               <hi>That you leave the Reader to
judge whether this be a tolerable account of the
Idea of Substance by Sensation and Reflection.
Answ.</hi> That which your Lordshp has given
in the precedent Pages, <hi>I think is not a very
tolerable account of my Idea of Substance,</hi> since
the account you give over and over again
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 15, 16, 17, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.</note> of my Idea of Substance is, that it <hi>is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a Complex Idea of Accidents.</hi> This is
your account of my Idea of Substance, which
you insist so much on, and which you say
<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. P. 24.</note> you took out of those places, <hi>I my self
produced</hi> in my first Letter. But if you had
been pleased to have set down this one, which
is to be found there<note n="†" place="margin">1 Let. p. 10.</note> amongst the rest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by me out of <hi>B. 2 ch. 12. Sect.</hi> 6. of
my Essay, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That the Ideas of Substances
are such Combinations of simple Ideas, as
are taken to Represent distinct particular
Things Subsisting by themselves, in which
the supposed or confused Idea of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
is <hi>always</hi> the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>chief.</hi>
               </q> This,
would have been a full Answer to all
that I think you have under that variety of
Heads, Objected against my Idea of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
But your Lordship in your Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of my Idea of Substance, thought
fit to leave this Passage out; though you are
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:65912:213"/>
pleased to set down several others produced
both before and after it in my first Letter,
which I think gives me a Right humbly to
return your Lordship your own Words,
<hi>And now I freely leave the Reader to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this, which your Lordship has given, be a
tolerable Account</hi> of my <hi>Idea of Substance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Point to be considered, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Immateriality of the Soul;
whereof there is a great deal said.<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 47-79.</note> The
Original of this Controversie, I shall set
down in your Lordship's own Words:<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 67.</note> You
say, <hi>The only Reason you had to engage in this
Matter, was this bold Assertion; That the Ideas
we have by Sensation or Reflection are the sole
Matter and Foundation of all our Reasoning, and
that our Certainty lies in perceiving the Agreement
and Disagreement of Ideas, as expressed in any
Proposition: which last,</hi> you say, <hi>are my own words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To overthrow <hi>this bold Assertion,</hi> you urge
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 68.</note> my acknowledgment,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Let. p. 67.</note> 
               <q>That upon my
Principles it cannot be demonstratively
proved, that the Soul is Immaterial tho'
it be in the highest degree probable.</q> And
then ask<note n="*" place="margin">ib.</note> 
               <hi>Is not this the giving up the cause of
Certainty?</hi> Answer: Just as much <hi>the giving
up the cause of Certainty</hi> on my side, as it is on
your Lordship's. Who tho' you will not
please to tell wherein you place <hi>Certainty,</hi>
yet it is to be supposed you do place <hi>Certainty</hi>
in something or other. Now let it be what
you will, that you place <hi>Certainty</hi> in, I take
the liberty to say, that you cannot certainly
prove <hi>i. e.</hi> demonstrate, that the Soul of
Man is Immaterial; I am sure you have
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:65912:213"/>
not so much as offered at any such proof, and
therefore you <hi>give up the cause of Certainty</hi>
upon your Principles. Because if the not
being able to demonstrate, that the Soul is
Immaterial upon his Principles, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
wherein he thinks Certainty consists,
be the <hi>giving up the cause of Certainty;</hi> the
not being able to demonstrate the Immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
of the Soul upon his Principles, who
does not tell wherein Certainty consists, is no
less <hi>a giving up of the cause of Certainty.</hi> The
only odds between these two is more Art
and Reserve in the one than the other. And
therefore my Lord, you must either upon
your Principles of Certainty demonstrate
that the Soul is Immaterial, or you must allow
me to say, that you too <hi>give up the cause of
Certainty,</hi> and your Principles <hi>tend to Scepticism</hi>
as much as mine. Which of these two your
Lordship shall please to do, will to me be
advantagious; for by the one I shall get a
Demonstration of the Souls Immateriality,
(of which I shall be very glad) and that upon
Principles, which reaching farther than
mine, I shall imbrace, as better than mine,
and become your Lordship's professed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert.
Till then I shall rest satisfied, that my
Principles be they as weak and fallible as your
Lordship please, are no more guilty of any
such tendency, than theirs, who talking more
of certainty cannot attain to it in cases, where
they condemn the <hi>way of Ideas</hi> for coming
short of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="394" facs="tcp:65912:214"/>
You a little lower in the same Page,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 68.</note> set
down these as my Words, <hi>That I never offered
it as a way of Certainty, where we cannot reach
Certainty.</hi> I have already told you that I
have been sometimes in doubt what Copy
you had got of my Essay: Because I often
found your Quotations out of it, did not
agree with what I read in mine: But by this
Instance here, and some others, I know not
what to think, since in my Letter, which I
did my self the Honour to send your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
I am sure the Words are not as they
are here set down. For I say, not that I
<hi>offered</hi> the way of Certainty there spoken of
which looks as if it were a new way of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
that I pretended to teach the World
Perhaps the difference, in these from my
Words is not so great, that upon an other
occasion I should take notice of it. But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to lead People into an Opinion, that I
spoke of the way of Certainty by Ideas, as
something new, which I pretended to teach
the World, I think it worth while to set
down my Words themselves, which I think
are so Penn'd, as to shew a great Cantion in me
to avoid such an opinion. <q>My Words<note n="*" place="margin">1 Let. p. 81.</note> are,
I think it is a way to bring us to a Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in those things, which I have offered as
Certain, but I never thought it a way to
Certainty, where we cannot reach Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What use your Lordship makes of the
term <hi>offered,</hi> applied to what I applied it
not, is to be seen in your next Words,
which you subjoin to those which you set
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:65912:214"/>
down for mine.<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 68.</note> 
               <hi>But did you not <hi>offer</hi> to put
us into a way of Certainty? And what is that
but to attain Certainty in such things where we
could not otherwise do it? Answ.</hi> If this your
way of reasoning here, carries Certainty in
it, I humbly conceive in your <hi>way of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
by Reason,</hi> Certainty may be attained,
where it could not otherwise be had. I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beg you my Lord, to shew me the place,
where I so <hi>offer to put you in a way of Certainty</hi>
different from what had formerly been the
way of Certainty, that Men by it might
<hi>attain to Certainty in things,</hi> which they could
not before my Book was writ. No Body
who reads my <hi>Essay</hi> with that indifferency,
which is proper to a Lover of Truth, can
avoid seeing, that what I say of <hi>Certainty</hi>
was not to teach the Wrold <hi>a new way of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
(though that be one great Objection
of yours against my Book) but to endeavour
to shew, wherein the old and only way of
Certainty consists; what was the occasion
and design of my Book may be seen plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough in the Epistle to the Reader,
without any need that any thing more should
be said of it. And I am too sensible of my
own Weakness not to profess, as I do<note n="*" place="margin">Essay B. 2. C. 11. §. 17.</note>,
That <q>I pretend not to teach, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</q>
I cannot but wonder what ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
you, my Lord, who are a <hi>Teacher</hi> of
Authority, mean to Truth or Certainty, by
condemning the way of Certainty by Ideas:
Because I own by it I cannot demonstrate,
that the Soul is Immaterial. May it not
be worth your considering, what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:65912:215"/>
this will be to <hi>Scepticism,</hi> when upon
the same grounds, you Words here<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 68.</note> shall
be turned upon you; and it shall be ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>What a strange way of Certainty is this,</hi>
[your Lordship's way by Reason] <hi>if it
fails us in some of the first Foundations of
the real Knowledge of our selves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To avoid this, you undertake<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 69.</note> to <hi>prove
from my own Principles, that we may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
               <q>That the first eternal Thinking
Being or Omnipotent Spirit cannot, if
he would, give to certain Systems of
created sensible Matter, put together
as he sees fit, some degrees of Sense, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
and Thought:</q> For this, my
Lord, is my Proposition,<note n="†" place="margin">Essay B. 4. C. 3. Sect. 6.</note> and this the
utmost that I have said concerning the
Power of Thinking in Matter.</p>
            <p>Your first Argument<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 69-73.</note> I take to be this
That according to me, the Knowledge we
have being by our Ideas, and our Idea of
Matter in general being a solid Substance,
and our Idea of Body a solid extended fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
Substance; if I admit Matter to be
capable of Thinking, I confound the Idea of
Matter with the Idea of a Spirit: To which I
answer, No, no more than I confound the Idea
of Matter with the Idea of an Horse, when I
say that Matter in general is <hi>a solid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Substance;</hi> and that an Horse is a
material Animal, or an extended solid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
with Sense and Spontaneous Motion.</p>
            <p>The Idea of Matter is an extended solid
Substance; where-ever there is such a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
there is Matter; and the Essence of
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:65912:215"/>
Matter, whatever other Qualities not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in that Essence, it shall please God to
superadd to it. For example, God creates
an extended solid Substance, without the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradding
any thing else to it, and so we
may consider it at rest: To some parts of
it he superadds, Motion, but it has still the
Essence of Matter: Other parts of it he
frames into Plants, with all the Excellencies
of Vegetation, Life and Beauty, which is to
he found in a Rose or a Peach-tree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Essence of Matter in general, but
it is still but Matter: To other parts he
adds Sense and Spontaneous Motion, and
those other Properties that are to be found
in an Elephant. Hitherto 'tis not doubted
but the Power of God may go, and that
the Properties of a Rose, a Peach or an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
superadded to Matter, change not
the Properties of Matter; but Matter is in
these things Matter still. But if one ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to go one step further and say, God
may give to Matter, Thought, Reason and
Volition, as well as Sense and Spontaneous
Motion, there are Men ready presently to
limit the Power of the Omnipotent Creator,
and tell us, he cannot do it; because it
destroys the Essence, or <hi>changes the essential
Properties</hi> of Matter. To make good which
Assertion they have no more to say, but
that Thought and Reason are not included
in the Essence of Matter. I grant it; but
whatever Excellency, not contained in its
Essence, be superadded to Matter, it does
not destroy the Essence of Matter, if it
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:65912:216"/>
leaves it an extended solid Substance;
where-ever that is, there is the Essence of
Matter; and if every thing of greater Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
superadded to such a Substance,
destroys the Essence of Matter, what will
become of the Essence of Matter in a Plant,
or an Animal, whose Properties far exceed
those of a meer extended solid Substance?</p>
            <p>But 'tis farther urged, That we cannot
conceive how Matter can Think. I grant
it; but to argue from thence, that God
therefore cannot give to Matter a Faculty of
Thinking, is to say God's Omnipotency
is limited to a narrow Compass, because
Man's Understanding is so; and brings
down God's infinite Power to the size of
our Capacities. If God can give no Power
to any parts of Matter, but what Men can
account for from the Essence of Matter in
general: If all such Qualities and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
must destroy the Essence or <hi>change the
essential Properties</hi> of Matter, which are to
our Conceptions above it, and we cannot
conceive to be the natural Consequence of
that Essence; it is plain, that the Essence of
Matter is destroyed and its <hi>essential Properties
changed</hi> in most of the sensible parts of this
our System: For 'tis visible, that all the
Planets have Revolutions about certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Centers, which I would have any one
explain, or make conceiveable by the bare
Essence or natural Powers depending on the
Essence of Matter in general, without some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
added to that Essence, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive; for the moving of Matter in
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:65912:216"/>
a crooked Line, or the attraction of Matter
by Matter, is all that can be said in the Case;
either of which, it is above our Reach to
derive from the Essence of Matter or Body
in general; though one of these two must
unavoidably be allowed to be superadded
in this instance to the Essence of Matter in
general. The Omnipotent Creator advised
not with us in the making of the World,
and his ways are not the less Excellent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are past our finding out.</p>
            <p>In the next place, the vegetable part of
the Creation is not doubted to be wholly
Material; and yet he that will look into
it will observe Excellencies and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in this part of Matter, which he will
not find contained in the Essence of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in general, nor be able to conceive
how they can be produced by it. And
will he therefore say, That the Essence of
Matter is destroyed in them, because they
have Properties and Operations not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the essential Properties of Matter
as Matter, nor explicable by the Essence of
Matter in general?</p>
            <p>Let us advance one step farther, and we
shall in the Animal World meet with yet
greater Perfections and Properties no ways
explicable by the Essence of Matter in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
If the Omnipotent Creator had not
superadded to the Earth, which produced
the irrational Animals, Qualities far surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
those of the dull dead Earth, out of
which they were made, Life, Sense, and
Spontaneous Motion, nobler Qualities than
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:65912:217"/>
were before in it, it had still remained rude
senseless Matter; and if to the Individuals
of each Species, he had not superadded a
Power of Propagation, the Species had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
with those Individuals: But by these
Essences or Properties of each Species, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded
to the Matter which they were
made of, the Essence or Properties of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in general were not destroyed or chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
any more than any thing that was in
the Individuals before, was destroyed or
changed by the Power of Generation, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added
to them by the first Benediction of the
Almighty.</p>
            <p>In all such Cases, the superinducement of
greater Perfections and nobler Qualities, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
nothing of the Essence or Perfections
that were there before; unless there can be
shewed a manifest Repugnancy between
them; but all the Proof offered for that,
is only, That we cannot conceive how
Matter, without such superadded Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
can produce such Effects; which is,
in Truth, no more than to say, Matter in
general, or every part of Matter, as Matter
has them not; but is no Reason to prove,
that God, if he pleases, cannot superadd
them to some parts of Matter, unless it can
be proved to be a Contradiction, that God
should give to some parts of Matter, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and Perfections, which Matter in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
has not; though we cannot conceive
how Matter is invested with them, or how
it Operates by Vertue of those new Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Nor is it to be wonder'd that we
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:65912:217"/>
cannot, whilst we limit all its Operations
to those Qualities it had before, and would
explain them, by the known Properties of
Matter in general, without any such super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced
Perfections. For if this be a right
Rule of Reasoning to deny a thing to be,
because we cannot conceive the manner how
it comes to be: I shall desire them who use
it, to stick to this Rule, and see what Work
it will make both in Divinity, as well as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy;
and whether they can advance any
thing more in favour of <hi>Scepticism?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For to keep within the present Subject of
the Power of Thinking and Self-motion,
bestow'd by Omnipotent Power on some
parts of Matter: The Objection to this
is, I cannot conceive how Matter should
Think: What is the Consequence?
<hi>Ergo,</hi> God cannot give it a Power to
Think. Let this stand for a good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and then proceed in other Cases by
the same. You cannot conceive how Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
can attract Matter at any distance, much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
at the distance of 1000000 Miles; <hi>Ergo,</hi>
God cannot give it such a Power; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive how Matter should feel, or
move it self, or affect an Immaterial Being,
or be moved by it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> God cannot give
it such Powers, which is in effect to deny
Gravity and the Revolution of the Planets
about the Sun; to make Brutes meer Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins
without Sense or Spontaneous Motion,
and to allow Man neither Sense nor volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Motion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:65912:218"/>
Let us apply this Rule one degree farther.
You cannot conceive how an extended so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Substance should Think, therefore God
cannot make it Think: Can you conceive
how your own Soul, or any Substance
Thinks? You find indeed, that you do
Think, and so do I; but I want to be told
how the Action of Thinking is performed:
This, I confess, is beyond my Conception;
and I would be glad any one, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
it, would explain it to me. God, I
find, has given me this Faculty; and since
I cannot but be convinced of his Power in
this Instance, which though I every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Experiment in my self, yet I cannot
conceive the manner of; what would it
be less than an insolent Absurdity, to deny
his Power in other like Cases only for this
Reason, because I cannot conceive the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how?</p>
            <p>To explain this Matter a little farther.
God has created a Substance; let it be, for
Example, a solid extended Substance; is
God bound to give it, besides Being, a
Power of Action? that, I think, no body
will say: He therefore may leave it in a
State of Inactivity, and it will be neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
a Substance; for Action is not necessary
to the Being of any Substance, that God
does create: God has likewise created and
made to Exist, <hi>de novo,</hi> an immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which will not lose its Being of a
Substance, though God should bestow on it
nothing more but this bare Being, without
giving it any Activity at all. Here are
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:65912:218"/>
now two distinct Substances, the one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
the other Immaterial, both in a State
of perfect Inactivity. Now I ask, what
Power God can give to one of these Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
(supposing them to retain the same
distinct Natures, that they had as Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in their State of Inactivity) which he
cannot give to the other? In that State, 'tis
plain, neither of them Thinks; for Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
being an Action, it cannot be denied,
that God can put an end to any Action of
any created Substance, without anihilating
of the Substance whereof it is an Action;
and if it be so, he can also create or give
Existence to such a Substance, without
giving that Substance any Action at all.
By the same Reason it is plain, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them can move it self: Now I
would ask, why Omnipotency cannot give
to either of these Substances, which are
equally in a State of perfect Inactivity,
the same Power, that it can give to the
other? Let it be for Example, that of
Spontaneous or Self-motion, which is a
Power that 'tis supposed God can give to
an unsolid Substance, but denyed that he
can give to solid a Substance.</p>
            <p>If it be asked, why they limit the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency
of God, in reference to the one
rather than the other of these Substances;
all that can be said to it, is, That they
cannot conceive, how the solid Substance
should ever be able to move it self. And
as little, say I, are they able to conceive
how a created unsolid Substance should
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:65912:219"/>
move it self: But there may be something
in an immaterial Substance, that you do
not know. I grant it; and in a material
one too: For Example, Gravitation of
Matter towards Matter, and in the several
Proportions observable, inevitably shews,
that there is something in Matter that we
do not understand, unless we can conceive
Self-motion in Matter; or an inexplicable
and inconceivable Attraction in Matter, at
immense and almost incomprehensible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:
It must therefore be confessed, that
there is something in solid, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solid
Substances, that we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
But this we know, that they may
each of them have their distinct Beings,
without any Activity superadded to them,
unless you will deny, That God can take
from any Being its Power of Acting, which
'tis probable will be thought too Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
for any one to do; and I say, it is as
hard to conceive Self-motion in a created
immaterial as in a material Being, consider
it how you will: And therefore this is no
Reason to deny Omnipotency to be able
to give a Power of Self-motion to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Substance, if he pleases, as well as
to an immaterial; since neither of them
can have it from themselves, nor can we
conceive how it can be in either of them.</p>
            <p>The same is visible in the other Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Thinking; both these Substances
may be made, and exist without Thought;
neither of them has, or can have the Power
of Thinking from it self: God may give it
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:65912:219"/>
to either of them according to the good
Pleasure of his Omnipoteney; and in which
ever of them it is, it is equally beyond
our Capacity to conceive, how either of
those Substances thinks. But for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to deny that God, who had Power
enough to give them both a Being out of
nothing, can by the same Omnipotency,
give them what other Powers and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
he pleases, has no better a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than to deny his Power of Creation,
because we cannot conceive how it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
and there at last this way of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
must terminate.</p>
            <p>That Omnipotency cannot make a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to be solid and not solid at the
same time, I think, with due Reverence,
we may say; but that a solid Substance may
not have Qualities, Perfections and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which have no natural or visibly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Connection with Solidity and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension,
is too much for us (who are but
of Yesterday, and know nothing) to be
positive in. If God cannot join things
together by Connections inconceiveable to
us, we must deny even the Consistency,
and Being of Matter it self; since every
Particle of it having some bulk, has its
Parts connected by ways inconceiveable to
us. So that all the Difficulties, that are
raised against the Thinking of Matter from
our Ignorance or narrow Conceptions, stand
not at all in the way of the Power of God,
if he pleases to ordain it so; nor proves
any thing against his having actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:65912:220"/>
some parcels of Matter, so disposed
as he thinks fit, with a Faculty of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
till it can be shewn, that it contains
a Contradiction to suppose it.</p>
            <p>Though to me Sensation be comprehended
under Thinking in general, yet in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Discourse, I have spoke of Sense in
Brutes, as distinct from Thinking. Because
your Lordship, as I remember, speaks of
Sense in Brutes. But here I take liberty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
That if your Lordship allows Brutes
to have Sensation, it will follow, either that
God can and doth give to some parcels of
Matter a Power of Perception and Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
or that all Animals have immaterial and
consequently, according to your Lordship,
immortal Souls, as well as Men; and to say
that Fleas and Mites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have immortal Souls
as well as Men, will possibly be looked on, as
going a great way to serve an Hypothesis, and
as it would not very well agree, with what
your Lordship says, 2 <hi>Answ.</hi> p. 64. to the
Words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> quoted out of <hi>Eccles.</hi> C. 3.</p>
            <p>I have been pretty large in making this
Matter plain, that they who are so forward
to bestow hard Censures or Names on the
Opinions of those, who differ from them,
may consider whether sometimes they are
not more due to their own: And that they
may be perswaded a little to temper that
Heat, which supposing the Truth in their
current Opinions, gives them (as they think)
a Right to lay what Imputations they please
on those who would fairly examin the
Grounds they stand upon. For talking
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:65912:220"/>
with a Supposition and Insinuations, that
Truth and Knowledge, nay and Religion
too, stands and falls with their Systems;
is at best but an imperious way of begging
the Question, and assuming to themselves
under the pretence of Zeal for the Cause of
God, a Title to Infallibility. It is very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
that Mens Zeal for Truth, should
go as far as their Proofs, but not go for
Proofs themselves. He that attacks received
Opinions, with any thing but fair Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
may, I own, be justly suspected not
to mean well; nor to be led by the Love
of Truth; but the same may be said of him
too, who so defends them. An Error is
not the better for being common, nor
Truth the worse for having lain neglected:
And if it were put to the Vote any where
in the World, I doubt, as things are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,
whether Truth would have the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority,
at least, whilst the Authority of
Men, and not the examination of Things
must be its Measure. The imputation of
<hi>Scepticism</hi> and those broad Insinuations, to
render what I have writ suspected, so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
as if that were the great Business of
all this Pains you have been at about me,
has made me say thus much my Lord, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as my Sense of the way to establish
Truth in its full Force and Beauty, than
that I think the World will need to have
any thing said to it, to make it distinguish
between your Lordship's and my Design in
Writing, which therefore I securely leave
to the Judgment of the Reader, and return
to the Argument in Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:65912:221"/>
What I have above said, I take to be a
full Answer to all that your Lordship would
infer from my Idea of Matter, of Liberty,
and of Identity, and from the power of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting.
You ask,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 73.</note> 
               <hi>How can my Idea
of Liberty agree with the Idea that Bodies can
operate only by Motion and Impulse? Answ.</hi>
By the omnipotency of God, who can make
all things agree, that involve not a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
'Tis true, I say,<note n="†" place="margin">Essay B. 2. C. 8. § 11.</note> 
               <q>That Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
operate by impulse and nothing
else.</q>And so I thought when I writ it
and yet can conceive no other way of their
operation. But I am since convinced by the
Judicious Mr. <hi>Newton</hi>'s incomparable Book,
that 'tis too bold a Presumption to limit
God's Power in this Point, by my narrow
Conceptions. The gravitation of Matter
towards Matter, by ways unconceivable to
me, is not only a Demonstration that God
can, if he pleases, put into Bodies, Powers,
and ways of Operation, above what can be
derived from our Idea of Body, or can be
explained by what we know of Matter, but
also an unquestionable and every where vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Instance, that he has done so And
therefore in the next Edition of my Book,
I shall take care to have that Passage recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Self-consciousness,</hi> your Lordship asks,
<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 74.</note> 
               <hi>What is there like Self-consciousness in Matter?</hi>
Nothing at all in Matter as Matter. But that
God cannot bestow on some parcels of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Power of Thinking, and with it Self-consciousness
will never be proved by ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:65912:221"/>
               <note n="*" place="margin">ib.</note> 
               <hi>How is it possible to apprehend that meer
Body should perceive that it doth perceive?</hi> The
weakness of our Apprehension I grant in
the Case: I confess as much as you please,
that we cannot conceive how a solid, no
nor how an unsolid created Substance thinks;
but this weakness of our Apprehensions,
reaches not the Power of God, whose weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is stronger than any thing in Men.</p>
            <p>Your Argument from Abstraction, we
have in this Question,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 76.</note> 
               <hi>If it may be in the
power of Matter to think, how comes it to be so
impossible for such organized Bodies as the Brutes
have, to enlarge their Ideas by Abstraction?
Answ.</hi> This seems to suppose, that I place
Thinking within the natural Power of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
If that be your Meaning, my Lord,
I neither say, nor suppose, that all Matter
has naturally in it a Faculty of Thinking,
but the direct contrary. But if you mean
that certain parcels of Matter, ordered by
the Divine Power, as seems fit to him, may
be made capable of receiving from his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency
the Faculty of Thinking; that
indeed I say, and that being granted, the
Answer to your Question is easie, since
if Omnipotency can give Thought to any
solid Substance, it is not hard to conceive,
that God may give that Faculty in an higher
or lower Degree, as it pleases him, who
knows what Disposition of the Subject is
suited to such a particular way or degree
of Thinking.</p>
            <p>Another Argument to prove, That
God cannot endue any parcel of Matter
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:65912:222"/>
with the Faculty of Thinking, is taken
from those Words of mine,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Let. p. 139.</note> where I shew,
by what connection of Ideas we may come
to know, That God is an Immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
They are these, <q>The Idea of an
eternal actual, knowing Being, with the
Idea of Immateriality, by the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Idea of Matter, and of its
actual Division, divisibility and want of
Perception, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> From whence your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
thus argues,<note n="†" place="margin">2 Ans. p. 77.</note> 
               <hi>Here the want of Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is owned to be so essential to Matter, that
God is therefore concluded to be Immaterial.
Ans.</hi> Perception and Knowledge in that one
Eternal Being, where it has its Sourse, 'tis
visible must be essentially inseparable from
it; therefore the actual want of Perception
in so great part of the particular parcels of
Matter is a Demonstration, that the first
Being, from whom Perception and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is inseparable, is not Matter: How far
this makes the <hi>want of Perception an essential
property of Matter</hi> I will not dispute; it
suffices that it shews, That Perception is not
an essential Property of Matter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Matter cannot be that eternal original
Being, to which Perception and Knowledge
is Essential. Matter, I say, naturally is
without Perception: <hi>Ergo,</hi> says your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<hi>want of Perception is an essential Property
of Matter, and God doth not change the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Properties of things, their Nature remaining.</hi>
From whence you infer, That God cannot
bestow on any parcel of Matter (the nature
of Matter remaining) a Faculty of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:65912:222"/>
If the Rules of Logick since my days
be not changed, I may safely deny this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.
For an Argument that runs thus,
<hi>God does not; Ergo,</hi> he cannot, I was taught
when I came first to the University, would
not hold. For I never said God <hi>did.</hi> But<note n="*" place="margin">B. 4. C. 3. § 6.</note>
               <q>That I see no Contradiction in it, that he
should, if he pleased, give to some sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stems
of sensless Matter, a Faculty of
Thinking,</q> and I know no Body, before
<hi>Des Cartes,</hi> that ever pretended to shew
that there was any Contradiction in it So
that at worst, my not being able to see in
Matter any such Incapacity, as makes it
impossible for Omnipotency to bestow on
it a Faculty of Thinking, makes me oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
only to the Cartesians. For as far as I
have seen or heard, the Fathers of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church never pretended to domonstrate
that Matter, was incapable to receive a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Sensation, Perception and Thinking,
from the Hand of the omnipotent Creator.
Let us therefore, if you please, suppose the
form of your Argumentation right, and
that your Lordship means, <hi>God cannot:</hi> And
then if your Argument be good, it proves,
That God could not give to <hi>Baalam</hi>'s Ass a
Power to speak to his Master as he did,
for the want of rational Discourse, being
natural to that Species, 'tis but for your
Lordship to call it an <hi>Essential Property,</hi> and
then God cannot change the <hi>Essential Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of things, their Nature remaining:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is proved, That God cannot with all
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:65912:223"/>
his Omnipotency, give to an Ass a Power
to speak as <hi>Balaam</hi>'s did.</p>
            <p>You say,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 78.</note> my Lord, <hi>you do not set Bound's
to God's Omnipotency. For he may if he please
change a Body into an Immaterial Substance,</hi> i. e.
take away from a Substance the Solidity which
it had before, and which made it Matter,
and then give it a Faculty of thinking, which
it had not before, and which makes it a
Spirit, the same Substance <hi>remaining.</hi> For
if the same Substance remains not, <hi>Body</hi> is
not <hi>changed into an Immaterial Substance.</hi> But
the solid Substance and all belonging to it
is Annihilated, and an Immaterial Substance
Created, which is not change of one thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another, but the destroying of one, and
making another <hi>de novo.</hi> In this change
therefore of a Body or Material Substance
into an immaterial, let us observe those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Considerations.</p>
            <p>First, you say, <hi>God may if He Pleases</hi> take
away from a Solid Substance Solidity, which
is that which makes it a Material Substance or
<hi>Body;</hi> and may make it <hi>an Immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
i. e. a Substance without Solidity.
But this privation of one Quality gives it
not another; the bare taking away a lower
or less Noble Quality does not give it an
Higher or Nobler; that must be the gift of
God. For the bare Privation of one, and a
meaner Quality, cannot be the Position of an
Higher and better: unless any one will say,
that Cogitation, or the Power of thinking
results from the Nature of Substance it self,
which if it do, then where ever there is
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:65912:223"/>
Substance, there must be Cogitation or a
Power of thinking. Here then, upon your
Lordship's own Principles is an <hi>Immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Sub<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ance</hi> without the Faculty of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>In the next place, you will not deny, but
God may give to this Substance thus depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Solidity a Faculty of thinking; for
you suppose it made capable of that by being
made Immaterial, whereby you allow, that
the same numerical Substance may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
wholly Incogitative or without a Power
of thinking, and at other times perfectly
Cogitative, or indued with a Power of
thinking.</p>
            <p>Further, you will not deny, but God can
give it Solidity and make it Material again.
For I conclude it will not be denied, that God
can make it again, what it was before. Now
I crave leave to ask your Lordship, why
God having given to this Substance the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of thinking after Solidity was taken from
it, cannot restore to it Solidity again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking away the Faculty of thinking.
When you have Resolved this my Lord, you
will have proved it impossible for God's
Omnipotence to give to a Solid Substance a
Faculty of thinking; but till then, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proved it impossible, and yet denying
that God can do it, is to deny that he can
do, what is in it self Possible; which as I
humbly conceive is visibly <hi>to set Bound's to
God's Omnipotency,</hi> tho' you say here,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 78.</note> 
               <hi>you
do not set Bound's to God's Omnipotency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:65912:224"/>
If I should imitate your Lordship's way
of Writing, I should not omit to bring in
<hi>Epicurus</hi> here, and take notice that this was
his way, <hi>Deum verbis ponere, re tollere.</hi> And
then add, that <hi>I am certain you do not think he
promoted the great ends of Religion and Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
For 'tis with such Candid and Kind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations
as these, that you bring in both
<hi>Hobbes,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 55.</note> and <hi>Spinosa,</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Ib. p. 79.</note> into your Discourse
here about God's being able, if he please,
to give to some parcels of Matter ordered as
he thinks fit, a Faculty of thinking. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of those Authors having as appears by
any Passages you bring out of them said any
thing to this Question, nor having, as it
seems, any other business here, but by their
Names skilfully to give that Character to my
Book, with which you would recommend it
to the World.</p>
            <p>I pretend not to enquire what measure of
Zeal, nor for what, guides your Lordships Pen
in such a way of Writing, as yours has all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
been with me: Only I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
what Reputation it would give to the
Writings of the Fathers of the Church, if
they should think Truth required, or Religion
allowed them to imitate such Patterns. But
God be thanked there be those amongst them
who do not admire such ways of manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Cause of Truth or Religion. They
being sensible, that if every one, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
or can pretend he has Truth on his side,
is thereby Authorized without proof, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate,
what ever may serve to prejudice
Mens minds against the other side, there will
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:65912:224"/>
be great ravage made on Charity and Practice,
without any gain to Truth or Knowledge.
And that the Liberties frequently taken by
Disputants to do so, may have been the cause
that the World in all Ages has received so
much harm, and so little advantage from
Controversies in Religion.</p>
            <p>These are the Arguments which your
Lordship has brought to confute one saying
in my Book, by other Passages in it, which
therefore being all but <hi>Argumenta ad Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
if they did prove what they do not,
are of no other use, than to gain a Victory
over me, a thing methinks so much beneath
your Lordship, that it does not deserve one
of your Pages. The question is, whether
God can if he pleases, bestow on any parcel
of Matter ordered as he thinks fit, a faculty
of Perception and Thinking. You say,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 79.</note>
               <hi>You look upon a Mistake herein to be of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Consequence, as to the great ends of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Morality.</hi> If this be so, my Lord,
I think one may well wonder, why your
Lordship has brought no Arguments to Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the Truth it self, which <hi>You look on to
be of such dangerous consequence to be mistaken
in;</hi> but have spent so many Pages only in a
<hi>Personal Matter</hi> in endeavouring to shew,
That I had Inconsistencies in my Book, which
if any such thing had been shewed, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
would be still as far from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided,
and the danger of mistaking about it
as little prevented, as if nothing of all this
had been said. If therefore your Lordship's
Care of the <hi>great ends of Religion and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:65912:225"/>
have made <hi>You think it necessary</hi> to clear
this Question, the World has reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
there is little to be said against that
Proposition, which is to be found in my
Book concerning the Possibility, that some
parcels of Matter might be so ordered by
Omnipotence, as to be endued with a facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Thinking, if God so pleased, since
your Lordship's Concern for the <hi>promoting
the great ends of Religion and Morality,</hi> has
not enabled you to produce one Argument
against a Proposition, <hi>that you think of so
dangerous consequence to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I crave leave to observe, That
though in your Title Page you promise
to prove, that my <hi>Notion of Ideas is inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with it self,</hi> (which if it were, it could
hardly be proved to be inconsistent with any
thing else,) <hi>and with the Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith;</hi> Yet your Attempts all along
have been to prove me in some Passages of
my Book inconsistent with my self, without
having shewn any Proposition in my Book
inconsistent with any <hi>Article of the Christian
Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I think, your Lordship has indeed made
use of one Argument of your own: But it
is such an one, that I confess I do not see
how it is apt much to promote Religion,
especially the Christian Religion founded on
Revelation. I shall set down your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Words, that they may be considered,
you say:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 54. 55.</note> That you are of Opinion, that the
great Ends of Religion and Morality are best
secured by the Proofs of the Immortality of the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:65912:225"/>
Soul from its Nature and Properties; and which
you think proves is Immaterial. Your Lordship
does not question whether God can give Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
to a Material Substance; but you say, it
<hi>takes off</hi> very much from the Evidence of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
if it depend wholly upon God's giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, which of its own Nature it is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, <hi>&amp;c. So likewise you say,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">2 Ans. p. 28.</note> If a Man
cannot be certain, but that Matter may think
(as I affirm) then what becomes of the Soul's
Immateriality (and consequently Immortality)
from its Operations? But for all this, say I,
<hi>his assurance of Faith remains on its own
Basis.</hi> Now you appeal to any Man of Sense,
whether the finding the uncertainty of his own
Principles which he went upon in point of Reason,
doth not weaken the Credibility of these funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Articles, when they are considered purely
at Matters of Faith? For before there was a
natural Credibility in them on the account of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
but by going on wrong grounds of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
all that is lost; and instead of being
Certain, he is more doubtful than ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
if the Evidence of Faith falls so much short of
that of Reason, it must needs have less effect
upon Men's Minds, when the Subserviency of
Reason is taken away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it must be when the
grounds of Certainty by Reason are vanished.
I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it at all probable, That he who finds his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
deceive him in such Fundamental Points,
should have his Faith stand firm and unmoveable
on the account of Revelation? For in Matters
of Revelation, there must be some Antecedent
Principles supposed before we can believe any thing
on the account of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="418" facs="tcp:65912:226"/>
More to the same purpose we have some
Pages farther, where from some of my
Words your Lordship says,<note n="*" place="margin">Ib p. 35.</note> 
               <hi>You cannot but
observe, That we have no Certainty upon my
grounds, that Self-consciousness depends upon an
individual Immaterial Substance, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that a Material Substance may, according to my
Principles, have Self-consciousness in it; at
least that I am not certain of the contrary.
Whereupon your Lordship bids me consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this doth not a little affect the whole Article
of the Resurrection?</hi> What does all this tend
to? But to make the World believe, that I
have <hi>lessened the Credibility</hi> of the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Soul and the Resurrection, by
saying, That though it be most highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that the Soul is Immaterial, yet upon
my Principles it cannot be demonstrated;
because it is not impossible to God's Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency,
if he pleases to bestow upon some
parcels of Matter disposed as he sees fit, a
faculty of thinking.</p>
            <p>This your Accusation of my <hi>lessening the
Credibility</hi> of these Articles of Faith is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on this, That the Article of the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of the Soul abates of its Credibility,
If it be allowed, That its Immateriality
(which is the supposed Proof from Reason
and Philosophy of its Immortality) cannot
be demonstrated from natural Reason:
Which Argument of your Lordship's bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
as I humbly conceive, on this, That
Divine Revelation abates of its <hi>Credibility</hi> in
all those Articles it proposes porportionably
as Humane Reason fails to support the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:65912:226"/>
of God. And all that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in those Passages has said, when Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
will I suppose be found to import
thus much, <hi>viz.</hi> Does God promise any
thing to Mankind to be believed? It is very
fit and credible to be believed, if Reason
can demonstrate it to be true. But if Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Reason comes short in the Case, and
cannot make it out, its <hi>Credibility</hi> is thereby
<hi>lessened;</hi> which is in effect to say, That the
Veracity of God is not a firm and sure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Faith to rely upon, without the
concurrent Testimony of Reason, <hi>i. e.</hi> with
Reverence be it spoken, God is not to be
believed on his own Word, unless what he
reveals be in it self credible, and might be
believed without him.</p>
            <p>If this be a way to promote Religion, the
Christian Religion in all its Articles, I am
not sorry, that it is not a way to be found in
any of my Writings, for I imagine any
thing like this would, (and I should think de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd)
to have other Titles than bare <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism</hi>
bestowed upon it, and would have
raised no small Out-cry against any one,
who is not to be supposed to be in the right
in all that he says, and so may securely say
what he pleases. Such as I, the <hi>Prophanum
Vulgus,</hi> who take too much upon us, if we
would examine, have nothing to do but to
hearken and believe, though what he said
should subvert the very Foundations of the
Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>What I have above observed, is so visibly
contained in your Lordship's Argument,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:65912:227"/>
That when I met with it in your Answer
to my first Letter, it seemed so strange from
a Man of your Lordship's Character, and
in a Dispute in defence of the Doctrin of
the Trinity, that I could hardly perswade
my self, but it was a slip of your Pen:
But when I found it in your second Letter
<note n="*" place="margin">2 Ans. p. 28, &amp; 29.</note> made use of again, and seriously enlarged
as an Argument of Weight to be insisted
upon, I was convinced, that it was a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
that you heartily imbraced, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
favourable soever it was to the Articles
of the Christian Religion, and particularly
those which you undertook to defend.</p>
            <p>I desire my Reader to peruse the Passages
as they stand in your Letters themselves,
and see whether what you say in them does
not amount to this, That a Revelation from
God is more or less credible according as it
has a stronger or weaker confirmation from
Humane Reason. For,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Your Lordship says,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 55.</note> You do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whether God can give Immortality to a
material Substance; but you say it <hi>takes off
very much</hi> from the evidence of Immortality,
if it depends wholly upon God's giving that
which of its own Nature it is not capable
of.</p>
            <p>To which I reply, any ones not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to demonstrate the Soul to be Immaterial,
<hi>takes off</hi> not <hi>very much,</hi> nor at all from the
<hi>evidence of its Immortality,</hi> if God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
that it shall be Immortal, because
the Veracity of God is a Demonstration of
the Truth of what he has revealed, and the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:65912:227"/>
want of an other Demonstration of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
that is demonstratively true, takes
not off from the Evidence of it. For
where there is a clear Demonstration, there
is as much Evidence as any Truth can have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that is not Self-evident. God has revealed
that the Souls of Men shall live for ever.
But says, your Lordship from this <hi>Evidence
it <hi>takes off</hi> very much if it depends wholly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God's giving that, which of its own Nature
it is not capable of.</hi> i. e. The Revelation and
Testimony of God loses much of its Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
if this depends wholly upon the
good Pleasure of God, and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratively
made out by natural Reason,
that the Soul is immaterial, and consequently
in its own Nature immortal. For that is
all that here is or can be meant by these
Words, <hi>which of its own Nature it is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of,</hi> to make them to the purpose. For
the whole of your Lordship's Discourse
here, is to prove, That the Soul cannot be
material, because then the Evidence of its
being immortal would be <hi>very much lessened.</hi>
Which is to say, That 'tis not as credible
upon divine Revelation, that a material
Substance should be immortal, as an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial;
or which is all one, That God is
not equally to be believed, when he declares,
that a material Substance shall be immortal,
as when he declares, that an immaterial shall
be so, because the Immortality of a material
Substance, cannot be demonstrated from
natural Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="422" facs="tcp:65912:228"/>
Let us try this Rule of your Lordship's
a little farther. God hath revealed, that the
Bodies Men shall have after the Resurrection,
as well as their Souls, shall live to Eternity.
Does your Lordship believe the eternal
Life of the one of these, more than of the
other, because you think you can prove it of
one of them by natural Reason, and of the
other not? Or can any one who admits
of divine Revelation in the Case, doubt
of one of them more than the other? Or
think this Proposition less credible, the
Bodies of Men, after the Resurrection, shall
live for ever; than this, That the Souls of
Men shall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after the Resurrection, live for
ever? For that he must do, if he thinks
either of them is less credible than the other.
If this be so, Reason is to be consulted,
how far God is to be believed, and the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of divine Testimony, must receive its
force from the Evidence of Reason; which
is evidently to take away the credibility
of divine Revelation, in all supernatural
Truths, wherein the Evidence of Reason
fails. And how much such a Principle as
this tends to the support of the Doctrin of
the Trinity, or the promoting the Christian
Religion, I shall leave it to your Lordship
to consider.</p>
            <p>I am not so well read in <hi>Hobbes</hi> or <hi>Spinoza,</hi>
as to be able to say, what were their Opinions
in this Matter. But possibly there be those,
who will think your Lordship's Authority
of more use to them in the Case, than those
justly decried Names: And be glad to find
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:65912:228"/>
your Lordship a Patron of the <hi>Oracles of
Reason,</hi>  so little to the Advantage of the
<hi>Oracles</hi> of Divine Revelation. This at least,
I think, may be subjoined to the Words
at the bottom of the next Page,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 65.</note> That
<hi>those who have gone about</hi> to lessen the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility
of Articles of Faith, which evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they do, who say they are less credible,
because they cannot be made out demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively
by Natural Reason, have not
been thought to secure several of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Christian Faith, especially
those of the <hi>Trinity, Inoarnation,</hi> and <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
of the Body, which are those upon
the account of which I am brought by
your Lordship into this Dispute.</p>
            <p>I shall not trouble the Reader with your
Lordship's Endeavours in the following
Words, to prove, That if the Soul be not
an immaterial Substance, it can be <hi>nothing
but Life;</hi> your very first Words visibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
all that you alledge to that purpose.
They are,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 55.</note> 
               <hi>If the Soul be immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
it is really nothing but Life;</hi> which is
to say, That if the Soul be really a <hi>Substance,</hi>
it is not really a <hi>Substance,</hi> but <hi>really no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
else but an affection of a Substance;
for the Life, whether of a material or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
Substance, is not the Substance it
self, but an affection of it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>You say,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 57.</note> Although we think the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
State of the Soul after Death, is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
revealed in the Scripture; yet it creates a
great difficulty in understanding it, if the Soul
be nothing but Life, or a material Substance,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:65912:229"/>
which must be dissolved when Life is ended. For
if the Soul be a material Substance, it must be
made up, as others are, of the Cohesion of solid
and separate Parts, how minute and invisible so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they be. And what is it which should keep
them together, when Life is gone? So that it is
no easie matter to give an account, <hi>how</hi> the
Soul should be capable of Immortality, unless it
be an immaterial Substance; and then we know
the Solution and Texture of Bodies cannot reach
the Soul, being of a different Nature.</p>
            <p>Let it be as hard <hi>a matter,</hi> as it will, <hi>to
give an account what it is, that should keep the
Parts of a material Soul together,</hi> after it is
separated from the Body; yet it will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
as easie to give an account of it, as to
<hi>give an account what it is which shall keep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>
a material and immaterial Substance.
And yet the difficulty <hi>that</hi> there is <hi>to give
an account of that,</hi> I hope does not, with
your Lordship, <hi>weaken the Credibility</hi> of the
inseparable Union of Soul and Body to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity:
And I perswade my self, that <hi>the
Men of Sense,</hi> to whom your Lordship <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals</hi>
in the Case, do not find their belief
of this <hi>Fundamental Point,</hi> much <hi>weakened</hi>
by that difficulty. I thought heretofore
(and by your Lordship's Permission, would
think so still) that the Union of Parts of
Matter, one with another, is as much in the
Hands of God, as the Union of a material
and immaterial Substance; and that it does
not <hi>take off very much,</hi> or at all, <hi>from the
Evidence of Immortality,</hi> which depends on
that Union, that <hi>it is no easie matter to give
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:65912:229"/>
an account what it is that should keep them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:</hi>
Though its <hi>depending wholly upon the
Gift and good Pleasure of God,</hi> where the
manner <hi>creates great difficulty in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
and our Reason cannot discover
in the <hi>Nature</hi> of things, <hi>how</hi> it is, be that
which your Lordship so positively <hi>says les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens
the Credibility of the Fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
of the <hi>Resurrection and Immortality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, my Lord, to remove this Objection
a little, and to shew of how small force it is
even with your self; give me leave to
presume, That your Lordship as firmly
believes the Immortality of the Body af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Resurrection, as any other Article
of Faith: If so, then it being <hi>no easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to give an account, what it is that shall keep
together</hi> the Parts of a material Soul, to
one that belives it is material, can no more
<hi>weaken the Credibility</hi> of its Immortality, than
the like difficulty <hi>weakens the Credibility</hi> of
the Immortality of the Body. For when
your Lordship shall find it <hi>an easie matter
to give an account, what</hi> it is besides the
good Pleasure of God, <hi>which shall keep toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
the Parts of our material Bodies to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
or even Soul and Body; I doubt
not but any one, who shall think the Soul
material, will also find it as <hi>easie to give
an account, what it is that</hi> shall <hi>keep</hi> those
Parts of Matter also <hi>together</hi> to Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Were it not that the Warmth of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
is apt to make Men so far forget,
as to take up those Principles themselves
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:65912:230"/>
(when they will serve their turn) which
they have highly condemned in others, I
should wonder to find your Lordship to
argue, That because it is a difficulty to <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what should keep together the minute
Parts of a material Soul, when Life is gone;
and</hi> because <hi>it is not an easie matter to give
an account <hi>how</hi> the Soul should be capable of
Immortality, unless it be an immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:</hi>
Therefore it is not so credible as if
it <hi>were easie to give an account</hi> by Natural
Reason, <hi>how <hi>it could be.</hi>
               </hi> For to this it is,
that all this your Discourse tends as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by what is already set down out of
Page 55; and will be more fully made out
by what your Lordship says in other places,
though there needs no such Proofs, since
it would all be nothing against me in any
other Sense.</p>
            <p>I thought your Lordship had in other
places asserted, and insisted on this Truth,
That no part of Divine Revelation was the
less to be believed, because the thing it self
<hi>oreated great difficulty in the understanding,</hi>
and the manner of it was hard to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained;
<hi>and it was no easie matter to give
an account</hi> how it was. This, as I take it,
your Lordship condemned in others, as a
very unreaonable Principle, and such as
would subvert all the Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, that were mere matters of
Faith, as I think it will: And is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that you should make use of it here
your self, against the Article of <hi>Life and
Immortality,</hi> that Christ hath brought to
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:65912:230"/>
light through the Gospel; and neither was,
nor could be made out by Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
without Revelation? But you will say,
you speak only of the Soul; and your
Words are, That <hi>it is no easie matter to
give an account <hi>how</hi> the Soul should be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Immortality, unless it be an immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Substance.</hi> I grant it; but crave leave
to say, That there is not any one of those
Difficulties, that are, or can be raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the manner <hi>how</hi> a material Soul can
be immortal, which do not as well reach
the Immortality of the Body.</p>
            <p>But if it were not so, I am sure this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of your Lordship's would reach other
Articles of Faith, wherein our natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
finds it not so easy to give an Account
<hi>how</hi> those Mysteries are: And which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
according to your Principles, must
be less <hi>credible,</hi> than other Articles, that
<hi>create less difficulty to the Vnderstanding.</hi> For
your Lordship says,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Answ. p. 28.</note> That <hi>you appeal to any
Man of Sense, whether</hi> to a Man who thought
by his Principles, he could from natural
Grounds demonstrate the Immortality of the
Soul, the <hi>finding the uncertainty of those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
he went upon in point of Reason,</hi> i. e. the
finding he could not certainly prove it by
natural Reason, <hi>doth not weaken the credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of that fundamental Article, when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
purely as a Matter of Faith?</hi> Which
in effect, I humbly conceive, amounts to
this, That a Proposition divinely revealed,
that cannot be proved by natural Reason,
is less credible than one that can: Which
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:65912:231"/>
seems to me to come very little short of
this, with due reverence be it spoken, That
God is less to be believed when he affirms
a Proposition, that cannot be proved by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Reason, than when he proposes what
can be proved by it. The direct contrary
to which is my Opinion, though you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make good, by these following
Words.<note n="†" place="margin">2 Answ. p. 29.</note> 
               <hi>If the evidence of Faith falls so
much short of that of Reason, it must needs have
less effect upon Men's Minds, when the subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency
of Reason is taken away; as it must be
when the Grounds of Certainty by Reason are
vanished. Is it at all probable, that he who
finds his Reason deceive him in such fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Points, should have his Faith stand firm and
unmoveable on the account of Revelation?</hi> Than
which I think there are hardly plainer
Words to be found out to declare, that
the credibility of God's Testimony depends
on the natural evidence or probability of the
things we receive from Revelation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
rises and falls with it: And that the Truths
of God, or the Articles of meer Faith, lose
so much of their <hi>credibility,</hi> as they want
Proof from Reason: Which if true, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
may come to have no <hi>credibility</hi> at
all. For if in this present Case, the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of this Proposition, The Souls of
Men shall five for ever, revealed in the
Scripture, be lessened by confessing it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be demonstratively proved from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
though it be asserted to be most high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
probable: Must not by the same Rule its
credibility dwindle away to nothing, if
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:65912:231"/>
natural Reason should not be able to make
it out to be so much as probable; or should
place the probability from natural Principles
on the other side? For if meer want of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
<hi>lessens the credibility</hi> of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
divinely revealed, must not want of
probability, or contrary probability from
natural Reason, quite take away its <hi>credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility?</hi>
Here at last it must end, if in any
one Case the Veracity of God, and the <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility</hi>
of the Truths we receive from him
by Revelation, be subjected to the verdicts
of humane Reason, and be allowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any accession or diminution from other
Proofs, or want of other Proofs of its Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
or Probability.</p>
            <p>If this be your Lordship's way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Religion or defend its Articles, I
know not what Argument the greatest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of it could use more effectual for the
Subversion of those you have undertaken
to defend, this being to resolve all Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
perfectly and purely into Natural
Reason, to bound its <hi>Credibility</hi> by that,
and leave no room for Faith in other things,
than what can be accounted for by Natural
Reason without Revelation.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 48-54.</note> insists much upon it,
as if I had contradicted what I had said in
my <hi>Essay,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">B. 2. C. 23.</note> by saying, That upon my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
it cannot be demonstratively proved,
that it is an immaterial Substance in us
that Thinks, however probable it be. He
that will be at the pains to read that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of mine, and consider it, will find, that
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:65912:232"/>
my Business there was to shew, that it was
no harder to conceive an immaterial than a
material Substance; and that from the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas
of Thought, and a Power of moving
of Matter, which we experienced in out
selves (Ideas originally not belonging to
Matter as Matter) there was no more
difficulty to conclude there was an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Substance in us, than that we had
material Parts. These Ideas of Thinking,
and Power of moving of Matter, I in
another place shew'd did demonstratively
lead us to the certain knowledge of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of an immaterial Thinking Being,
in whom we have the Idea of Spirit in the
strictest Sense; in which Sense I also applyed
it to the Soul, in that 23d Chapter of my
<hi>Essay,</hi> the easily conceivable possibility, nay
great probability, that that thinking Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in us is immaterial, giving me suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Ground for it: In which Sense I shall
think I may safely attribute it to the think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Substance in us, till your Lordship shall
have better proved from my Words, That
it is impossible it should be immaterial. For
I only say, That it is possible, <hi>i. e.</hi> involves
no Contradiction, that God the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
immaterial Spirit should, if he pleases,
give to some parcels of Matter, disposed
as he thinks fit, a Power of Thinking and
Moving: Which parcels of Matter so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with a Power of Thinking and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
might properly be called Spirits, in
contradistinction to unthinking Matter. In
all which, I presume, there is no manner of
Contradiction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:65912:232"/>
I justified my use of the word <hi>Spirit</hi> in that
Sense from the Authorities of <hi>Cicero</hi> and
<hi>Virgil,</hi> applying the Latin word <hi>Spiritus,</hi>
from whence <hi>Spirit</hi> is derived, to the Soul as
a thinking Thing, without excluding Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riality
out of it. To which your Lordship
replies,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 58-60.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi> Cicero, in his <hi>Tusculan</hi> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
<hi>supposes the Soul not to be a finer sort of
Body, but of a different Nature from the
Body.—That he calls the Body the Prison of
the Soul.</hi>—And says, <hi>That a wise Man's
Business is to draw off his Soul from his Body.</hi>
And then your Lordship concludes, as is
usual, with a Question, <hi>Is it possible now to
think so great a Man look'd on the Soul but as a
modification of the Body, which must be at an end
with Life?</hi> Answ. No; it is impossible that
a Man of so good Sense as <hi>Tully,</hi> when he
uses the word <hi>Corpus</hi> or <hi>Body</hi> for the gross
and visible parts of a Man, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
to be mortal, should <hi>look on the
Soul to be a modification of that Body;</hi> in a
Discourse wherein he was endeavouring to
persuade another, that it was immortal.
It is to be acknowledge'd that truly <hi>great Men,</hi>
such as he was, are not wont so manifestly
to contradict themselves. He had therefore
no Thought concerning the <hi>modification of the
Body</hi> of Man in the Case: He was not such a
Trifler as to examin, whether the modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Body of a Man was immortal,
when that Body it self was mortal: And
therefore that which he reports as <hi>Dicoear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>'s
Opinion, he dismisses in the beginning
without any more ado, <hi>c.</hi> 11. But <hi>Cicero</hi>'s was a
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:65912:233"/>
direct, plain and sensible Enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi>
What the Soul was, to see whether from
thence he could discover its Immortality?
But in all that Discourse in his first Book of
<hi>Tusculan Questions,</hi> where he lays out so
much of his Reading and Reason, there is
not one Syllable shewing the least Thought,
that the Soul was an immaterial Substance;
but many Things directly to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Indeed (1.) he shuts out the <hi>Body</hi> taken,
in the Sense he uses<note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 19, 22, 30, 31, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Corpus</hi> all-a-long, for
the sensible organical parts of a Man; and
is positive that is not the Soul: And <hi>Body</hi> in
this Sense, taken for the Humane Body, he
calls the <hi>Prison of the Soul;</hi> and says a wise
Man, instancing in <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> is glad
of a fair opportunity to get out of it. But
he no where says any such thing of Matter:
He calls not Matter in general the Prison of
the Soul, nor talks a Word of being separate
from it.</p>
            <p>2. He concludes, That the Soul is not
like other Things here below, made up of a
Composition of the Elements, <hi>c.</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>3. He excludes the two gross Elements
Earth and Water, from being the Soul,
<hi>c.</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>So far he is clear and positive: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
this he is uncertain; beyond this he
could not get. For in some Places he speaks
doubtfully, whether the Soul be not Air, or
Fire. <hi>Anima sit animus ignisve nescio,</hi> c. 25.
And therefore he agrees with <hi>Panoetius,</hi> that,
if it be at all Elementary, it is, as he calls it,
<pb facs="tcp:65912:233"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:65912:234"/>
               <pb n="433" facs="tcp:65912:234"/>
               <hi>Inflammata Anima, inflamed Air;</hi> and for
this he gives several Reasons, <hi>c.</hi> 18, 19.
And though he thinks it to be of a <hi>peculiar
Nature of its own,</hi> yet he is so far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it immaterial, that he says, <hi>c.</hi> 19. That
the admitting it to be of an <hi>aereal</hi> or <hi>igneous
Nature,</hi> would not be inconsistent with any
thing he had said.</p>
            <p>That which he seems most to incline to is,
That the Soul was not at all Elementary,
but was of the same Substance with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
which <hi>Aristotle,</hi> to distinguish from
the four Elements and the changeable Bodies
here below, which he supposed made up of
them, called <hi>Quinta Essentia.</hi> That this was
<hi>Tully</hi>'s Opinion is plain from these Words,
<hi>Ergo, <hi>Animus</hi> qui ut ego dico, divinus est, ut
Euripides audet dicere Deus; &amp; quidem si Deus,
aut anima aut ignis est, idem est animus hominis.
Nam ut illa natura coelestis &amp; terra vacat &amp;
humore; sic utriusque harum rerum humanus
animus est expers. Sin autem est quinta quaedam
natura ab Aristotele inducta; primum haec &amp;
deorum est &amp; animorum. Hanc nos sententiam
secuti, his ipsis verbis in Consolatione haec expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus,</hi>
c. 26. And then he goes on <hi>c.</hi> 27.
to repeat those his own Words, which your
Lordship has quoted out of him, wherein he
had affirmed, in his Treatise <hi>de Consolatione,</hi>
the Soul not to have its Original from the
Earth, or to be mixed or made of any
Thing earthly; but had said, <hi>Singularis est
igitur, quaedam natura &amp; vis animi sejuncta ab
his usitatis notisque naturis:</hi> Whereby, he tells
us, lie meant nothing but <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Quinta
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:65912:235"/>
Essentia;</hi> which being unmixed, being that
of which the Gods and Souls consisted, he
calls it <hi>divinum coeleste,</hi> and concludes it eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
it being as he speaks, <hi>Sejuncta ab omni
mortali concretione.</hi> From which it is clear,
That in all his Enquiry about the Substance
of the Soul, his Thoughts went not beyond
the four Elements, or <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Quinta Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentia</hi>
to look for it. In all which there is
nothing of Immateriality, but quite the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was willing to believe (as good and
wise Men have always been) that the Soul
was immortal; but for that 'tis plain he
never thought of its Immateriality, but as
the Eastern People do who believe the Soul
to be immortal, but have nevertheless no
Thought, no Conception of its Immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.
It is remarkable what a very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and judicious Author</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Loubere du Reyaume de Siam, <hi>T. 1. c.</hi> 19. § 4.</note> 
               <hi>says in the Case.</hi>
No Opinion, <hi>says he,</hi> has been so universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
as that of the Immortality of the Soul:
But its Immateriality is a Truth the knowledge
whereof has not spread so far. And indeed it is
extremely difficult to let into the Mind of a <hi>Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,</hi>
the Idea of a pure Spirit. This the Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries,
who have been longest among them, are
positive in. All the Pagans of the East do truly
believe, That there remains something of a Man
after his Death, which subsists independently and
separately from his Body. But they give Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
and Figure to that which remains, and
attribute to it all the same Members, all the
same Substances, both solid and liquid, which our
Bodies are composed of. They only suppose that
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:65912:235"/>
the Souls are of a Matter subtil enough to escape
being seen or handled.—Such were the <hi>Shades</hi>
and the <hi>Manes</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Romans.</hi>
And 'tis by these Figures of the Souls, answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to those of the Bodies, that <hi>Virgil</hi> supposed
<hi>Eneas</hi> knew <hi>Palinurus, Dido</hi> and <hi>Anchises,</hi> in
the other World.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman was not a Man that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
into those Parts for his Pleasure, and
to have the opportunity to tell strange Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
collected by Chance, when he return'd:
But one chosen on purpose (and he seems
well chosen for the purpose) to inquire into
the Singularities of <hi>Siam.</hi> And he has so
well acquitted himself of the Commission,
which his Epistle Dedicatory tells us he had,
to inform himself exactly of what was most
remarkable there, that had we but such an
Account of other Countries of the East, as he
has given us of this Kingdom, which he was
an Envoy to, we should be much better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
than we are, with the Manners,
Notions and Religions of that part of the
World, inhabited by civiliz'd Nations, who
want neither good Sense nor acuteness of
Reason, though not cast into the Mould
of the Logick and Philosophy of our
Schools.</p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Cicero.</hi> 'Tis plain, That
in his Enquiries about the Soul his Thoughts
went not at all beyond Matter. This the
Expressions, that drop from him in several
places of this Book, evidently shew. For
Example, That the Souls of excellent Men
and Women ascended into Heaven; of others
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:65912:236"/>
that they remained here on Earth, <hi>c.</hi> 12.
That the Soul is hot and warms the Body:
That at its leaving the Body it penetrates
and divides, and breaks through our thick,
cloudy, moist Air: That it stops in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of Fire, and ascends no farther, the
equality of Warmth and Weight making
that its proper place, where it is nourished
and sustained with the same Things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Stars are nourished and sustained,
and that by the convenience of its. Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
it shall there have a clearer View
and fuller knowledge of the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<hi>c.</hi> 19. That the Soul also from this
height shall have a pleasant and fairer Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the Globe of the Earth, the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of whose Parts will then lie before it
in one View, <hi>c.</hi> 20. That it is hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin
what Conformation, Size and Place,
the Soul has in the Body: That it is too sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
to be seen: That it is in the Human Body
as in a House or a Vessel, or a Receptacle,
<hi>c.</hi> 22. All which are Expressions that suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
evidence, that he who used them had
not in his Mind separated Materiality from
the Idea of the Soul.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be replied, That a great
part of this, which we find in <hi>chap.</hi> 19. is
said upon the Principles of those who would
have the Soul to be <hi>Anima Inflammata, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
Air.</hi> I grant it. But it is also to be
observed, That in this 19th and the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Chapters he does not only not deny,
but even admits, That so material a thing as
infiamed Air may think.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="437" facs="tcp:65912:236"/>
The Truth of the Case in short is this;
<hi>Cicero</hi> was willing to believe the Soul im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,
but when he sought in the Nature
of the Soul it self something to establish this
his Belief into a Certainty of it, he found
himself at a loss. He confessed he knew not
what the Soul was; but the not knowing
what it was, he argues, <hi>c.</hi> 2. was no Reason
to conclude it was not. And thereupon he
proceeds to the repetition of what he had
said in his 6th Book <hi>de Repub.</hi> concerning
the Soul. The Argument, which borrowed
from <hi>Plato</hi> he there makes use of, if it have
any force in it, not only proves the Soul to
be immortal, but more than, I think, your
Lordship will allow to be true: For it proves
it to be eternal, and without beginning, as
well as without end, <hi>Neque nata certa est, &amp;
aeterna est,</hi> says he.</p>
            <p>Indeed from the Faculties of the Soul he
concludes right, That it is of <hi>divine Original:</hi>
But as to the Substance of the Soul, he at
the end of this Discourse concerning its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
<hi>c.</hi> 25. as well as at the beginning of
it, <hi>c.</hi> 22. is not ashamed to own his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
what it is; <hi>Anima sit animus, ignisve,
nescio; nec me pudet ut istos, fateri nescive quod
nesciam. Illud, si ulla alia de re obscura affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare
possum, sive anima, sive ignis sit animus,
eum jurarem esse divinam,</hi> c. 23. So that all
the Certainty he could attain to about the
Soul, was, That he was confident there
was something divine in it, <hi>i. e.</hi> there were
Faculties in the Soul that could not result
from the Nature of Matter, but must have
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:65912:237"/>
their Original from a Divine Power; but
yet those Qualities, as Divine as they were,
he acknowledg'd might be placed in Breath
or Fire, which I think your Lordship will
not deny to be material Substances. So that
all those divine Qualities, which he so much
and so justly extols in the Soul, led him not,
as appears, so much as to any the least
Thought of Immateriality. This is Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
That he built them not upon an
exclusion of Materiality out of the Soul; for
he avowedly professes he does not know but
Breath of Fire might be this thinking Thing
in us: And in all his Considerations about
the Substance of the Soul it self, he stuck in
<hi>Air</hi> or <hi>Fire,</hi> or <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Quinta Essentia;</hi>
for beyond those 'tis evident he went
not.</p>
            <p>But with all his Proofs out of <hi>Plato,</hi> to
whose Authority he defers so much, with
all the Arguments his vast Reading and great
Parts could furnish him with for the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of the Soul, he was so little satisfied,
so far from being certain, so far from any
Thought that he had, or could prove it, that
he over and over again professes his Ignorance
and Doubt of it. In the beginnig he enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merates
the several Opinions of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
which he had well studied, about it:
And then full of Uncertainty says, <hi>Harum
Sententiarum quae vera sit, Deus aliquis viderit,
quae veri simillima magna quaestio,</hi> c. 11. And
towards the latter end having gone them all
over again, and one after another examin'd
them, he professes himself still at a loss, not
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:65912:237"/>
knowing on which to pitch, nor what to
determin. <hi>Mentis acies,</hi> says he, <hi>seipsam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuens
nonnunquam hebescit,</hi> ob eamque causam
<hi>contemplandi diligentiam omittimus. Itaque dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitans,
circuspectans, haesitans, mulia adversa
revertens tanquam in rate in mari immenso, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra
vehitur or atio,</hi> c. 30. And to conclude
this Argument, when the Person he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
as discoursing with him, tells him he
is resolved to keep firm to the belief of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
<hi>Tully</hi> answers, c. 82. <hi>Laudo id
quidem, etsi nihil animis oportet considere; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemur
enim saepe aliquo acute concluso, labamus,
mutamusque sententiam clarioribus etiam in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus;
in his est enim aliqua obscuritas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So unmoveable is that Truth delivered by
the Spirit of Truth, That though the Light
of Nature gave some obscure glimmering,
some uncertain hopes of a future State; yet
Human Reason could attain to no Clearness,
no Certainty about it, but that it was JESUS
CHRIST alone who had <hi>brought Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
to light, through the Gospel.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 10.</note> Tho'
we are now told, That to own the inability
of natural Reason to bring <hi>Immortality to
Light,</hi> or which passes for the same, to own
Principles upon which the Immateriality of
the Soul (and as 'tis urged consequently its
Immortality) cannot be demonstratively
proved <hi>does lessen the belief of</hi> this Article of
Revelation, which JESUS CHRIST alone
<hi>has brought to Light,</hi> and which consequently
the Scripture assures us is established and
made certain only by Revelation. This
would not perhaps have seemed strange from
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:65912:238"/>
those who are justly complained of, for
slighting the Revelation of the Gospel, and
therefore would not be much regarded, if
they should contradict so plain a Text of
Scripture in favour of their all-sufficient
Reason: But what use the <hi>Promoters of Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism
and Infidelity, in an Age</hi> so much suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by your Lordship, may make of what
comes from one of your great Authority
and Learning, may deserve your Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>And thus my Lord, I hope, I have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
you concerning <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Opinion about
the Soul in his first Book of <hi>Tusculan</hi> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions;
which, though I easily believe, as
your Lordship says, <hi>you are no Stranger to,</hi>
yet I humbly conceive you have not shewn
(and upon a careful perusal of that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
again I think I may boldly say you cannot
shew) one Word in it, that expresses any
thing like a Notion in <hi>Tully</hi> of the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiality,
or its being an immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>From what you bring out of <hi>Virgil</hi> your
Lordship<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 62, 63.</note> concludes, <hi>That he no more than</hi>
Cicero <hi>does me any kindness in this Matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both Assertors of the Souls Immortality.</hi> My
Lord, were not the Question of the Souls
Immateriality, according to Custom, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here into that of its <hi>Immortality,</hi> which I
am no less an Assertor of than either of them,
<hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> do me all the <hi>kindness</hi> I
desired of <hi>them in this Matter;</hi> and that was
to shew, that they attributed the word <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus</hi>
to the Soul of Man, without any thought
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:65912:238"/>
of its Immateriality; and this the Verses
you your self bring out of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Aeneids 4. 385.</note>
               <q>

               </q>
confirm, as well as those I quoted out of
his 6th Book; and for this Monsieur <hi>de la
Loubere</hi> shall be my Witness in the Words
above set down out of him; where he shews,
that there be those amongst the Heathens
of our days, as well as <hi>Virgil</hi> and others
amongst the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> who
thought the Souls or Ghosts of Men depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
did not die with the Body, without
thinking them to be perfectly immaterial;
the latter being much more incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to them than the former.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 64-65.</note> Answer concerning
what is said, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 13. turns wholly upon
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s taking the Soul to be Immortal,
which was not what I questioned: All that
I quoted that place for, was to shew, that
<hi>Spirit</hi> in English might properly be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Soul, without any Notion of its
Immateriality, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was by <hi>Solomon,</hi>
which whether he thought the Souls of
Men to be immaterial, does little appear in
that Passage, where he speaks of the Souls
of Men and Beasts together, as he does.
But farther, what I contended for, is
evident from that place, in that the Word
<hi>Spirit</hi> is there applyed, by our Translators,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:65912:239"/>
to the Souls of Beasts, which your Lordship I
think does not rank amongst the immaterial,
and consequently immortal <hi>Spirits,</hi> though
they have Sense and Spontaneous Motion.</p>
            <p>But you say,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 65.</note> 
               <hi>If the Soul be not of it self
a free thinking Substance, you do not see what
Foundation there is in Nature for a day of
Iudgment. Answer.</hi> Though the Heathen
World did <hi>not of</hi> old, nor do to this day,
<hi>see a Foundation in Nature for a day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
Yet in Revelation, if that will fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your Lordship, every one may <hi>see a
Foundation for a day of Iudgment,</hi> because
God has positively declared it; tho' God
has not by that Revelation taught us, what
the Substance of the Soul is; nor has any
where said, That <hi>the Soul</hi> of it self <hi>is a free</hi>
Agent. Whatsoever any created Substance
is, it is not <hi>of it self,</hi> but is by the good
Pleasure of its Creator: Whatever degrees
of Perfection it has, it has from the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Hand of its Maker. For it is true,
in a natural, as well as a spiritual Sense,
what St. <hi>Paul</hi> says,<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Not that we are sufficient
<hi>of our celbes</hi> to think any thing <hi>as of our selves,</hi>
but our sufficiency is of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But your Lordship, as I guess, by your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Words, would argue, That a material
Substance cannot be a free Agent; whereby I
suppose you only mean, that you cannot <hi>see</hi> or
conceive how a solid Substance should begin,
stop, or change its own Motion. To which
give me leave to answer, That when you
can make it conceivable, how any created,
finite, dependent Substance can move it
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:65912:239"/>

it must to be <hi>a free</hi> Agent; I suppose you
will find it no harder for God to bestow
this Power on a solid, than an unsolid created
Substance. <hi>Tully,</hi> in the place above quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<note n="†" place="margin">Tuscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, L. 1. C. 23.</note> could not conceive this Power to be

how any created Substance, solid or not so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
can be <hi>a free</hi> Agent (pardon me, my
Lord, if I put in both, till your Lordship
please to explain it of either, and shew the
manner how either of them can, <hi>of it self,</hi>

think, you will so far deny Men to be <hi>free</hi>
Agents, from the difficulty there is to <hi>see</hi>
how they are free Agents, as to doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            </p>
            <p>It is not for me to judge how far your
Lordship's Speculations reach: But finding
in my self nothing to be truer than what the

               <hi>As thou knowest not

rejoyce in the Light of Revelation, which
fets me at rest in many things; the manner
whereof my poor Reason can by no means
make out to me: Omnipotency, I know,
can do any thing that contains in it no
Contradiction; so that I readily believe
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:65912:240"/>
whatever God has declared, though my
Reason find Difficulties in it, which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
master. As in the present Case, God
having revealed, that there shall be a day of
Judgment, I think that <hi>Foundation</hi> enough,
to conclude Men are <hi>free</hi> enough to be
made answerable for their Actions, and to
receive according to what they have done,
though how Man is <hi>a free</hi> Agent surpass

            <p>In answer to the place I brought out of
St. <hi>Luke,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">C. 24. v. 39.</note> your Lordship asks,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 66.</note> 
               <hi>Whether,
from these Words of our Saviour, it follows,
that a Spirit is only an Appearance. I Answer.</hi>
No, nor do I know who drew such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
from them: But it follows, that
in <hi>Apparitions</hi> there is something that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
and that that which appears is not
wholly immaterial; and ye this was proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and was often looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by those, who called it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Greek,
and now call it <hi>Spirit</hi> in English, to be
the Ghost or Soul of one departed, which
I humbly conceive justifies my use of the
Word <hi>Spirit,</hi> for a thinking, voluntary A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
whether material or immaterial.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship says,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 67.</note> 
               <hi>That I grant,</hi> that
it cannot, upon these Principles, be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
that the spiritual Substance in us is
immaterial: From whence you conclude,
<hi>That then my Grounds of Certainty from I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas,
are plainly given up.</hi> This being a
way of arguing, that you often make use
of, I have often had Occasion to consider it,
and cannot after all see the force of this
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:65912:240"/>
Argument. I acknowledge, that this or that
Proposition cannot upon my Principles be
demonstrated, <hi>Ergo,</hi> I grant this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be False, that Certainty consists in the
Perception of the Agreement or Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Ideas. For that is my ground of
Certainty, and till that be given up, <hi>my
grounds of Certainty</hi> are not <hi>given up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You farther tell me,<note n="*" place="margin">ib.</note> 
               <hi>That I say,</hi> the
Souls immateriality may be proved proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the highest degree; to which your
Lordship replies. <hi>That is not the Point: For
it is not Probability but Certainty, that you are
promised in this way of Ideas, and that the
Foundation of our Knowledge and real Certainty
lies in them, and is it dwindled into a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
at last?</hi> This is also what your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
has been pleased to object to me more
than once, That <hi>I promised Certainty.</hi> I
would be glad to know in what Words this
<hi>Promise</hi> is made, and where it stands, for
I love to be a Man of my Word. I have
indeed told wherein I think Certainty, real
Certainty does consist, as far as any one
attains it: And I do not yet, from any
thing your Lordship has said against it,
find any Reason to change my Opinion
therein: But I do not remember, that I
promised Certainty in this Question, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Souls immateriality, or in any
of those Propositions, wherein you think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I come short of Certainty, infer from
thence, That my <hi>way of Certainty by Ideas
is given up.</hi> And I am so far from <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
Certainty</hi> in all Things, that I am
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:65912:241"/>
accused by your Lordship of <hi>Scepticism,</hi>
for setting too narrow Bounds to our
Knowledge and Certainty. Why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Lordship asks me, and <hi>is the
Certainty</hi> [of the Souls being immaterial]
<hi>dwindled into a Probability at last?</hi> Will be
hard to see a Reason for, till you can shew,
that I promised to demonstrate, that it is
immaterial; or that others upon their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
without Ideas, being able to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
it immaterial, it comes <hi>to dwindle into
bare Probability,</hi> upon my Principles by Ideas.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One thing more I am obliged to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of. I had said,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">1 Let. p. 113.</note> 
               <q>
                  <hi>That the Belief
of God being the Foundation of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and genuine Morality, I thought
no Arguments, that are made use of to
work the persuasion of a God into Men's
Minds, should be invalidated, which I
grant is of ill Consequence.</hi>
               </q> To which
Words of mine I find, according to your
particular Favour to me, this Reply,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Ans. p. 89.</note> That
here I must give your Lordship leave to ask me,
what I think of the universal consent of Mankind,
as to the Being of God? hath not this been
made use of, as an Argument, not only by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but by the wisest and greatest Men among
the Heathens? And what then would I think
of one who should go about to invalidate this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument?
And that by proving, That it bath
been discovered in these latter Ages by Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that there are whole Nations at the <hi>Bay</hi>
of <hi>Soldania,</hi> in <hi>Brasil,</hi> in the <hi>Caribbe-Islands</hi>
and <hi>Paraquaria,</hi> among whom there was found
no Notion of a God. And even the Author of
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:65912:241"/>
the Essay of Hum ane Vnderstanding hath done
this.</p>
            <p>To this your Question, my Lord, I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That <hi>I think that the universal consent
of Mankind, as to the being of a God,</hi> amounts
to thus much, that the vastly greater majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Mankind, have, in all Ages of the
World, actually believed a God; that the
majority of the remaining part have not
actually disbelieved it, and consequently
those who have actually opposed the belief
of a God, have truly been very few. So
that comparing those that have actually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed
with those who have actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
a God, their number is so inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
that in respect of this incomparably
greater majority of those who have owned
the belief of a God, it may be said to be the
universal consent of Mankind.</p>
            <p>This is all the <hi>universal consent</hi> which Truth
of matter of Fact will allow, and therefore
all that can be made use of to prove a God.
But if any one would extend it farther, and
speak deceitfully for God: If this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality
should be urged in a strict Sense, not
for much the majority, but for a general
<hi>consent</hi> of every one, even to a Man in all
Ages and Countries; this would make it
either no Argument, or a perfectly useless
and unnecessary one. For if any one deny
a God, such a perfect universality of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
is destroy'd; and if no Body does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a God, what need of Arguments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
Atheists?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="448" facs="tcp:65912:242"/>
I would crave leave to ask your Lordship,
were there ever in the World any Atheist
or no? If there were not, what need is
there of raising a Question about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a God, when no Body Questions it?
What need of provisional Arguments against
a Fault, from which Mankind are so wholly
free; and which by an universal consent,
they may be presumed to be secure from?
If you say (as I doubt not but you will) that
there have been Atheists in the World, then
your Lordship's <hi>universal consent</hi> reduces it
self to only a great majority, and then make
that majority as great as you will, what I
have said in the place quoted by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
leaves it in its full force, and I have
not said one Word, that does in the least
<hi>invalidate this Argument</hi> for a God. The
Argument I was upon there, was to shew,
That the Idea of God was not innate; and
to my purpose it was sufficient if there
were but a less number found in the World,
who had no Idea of God, than your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
will allow there have been of professed
Atheists; for whatsoever is innate must be
universal in the strictest Sense: One Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a sufficient Proof against it. So that
all that I said, and which was quite to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purpose, did not at all tend, nor can
be made use of to <hi>invalidate the Argument</hi> for
a Deity, grounded on such an <hi>universal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
as your Lordship, and all that build on
it, must own, which is only a very dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
Majority: Such <hi>an universal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
my Argument there neither affirm snor
<pb facs="tcp:65912:242"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:65912:243"/>
               <pb n="449" facs="tcp:65912:243"/>
requires to be less, than you will be pleased
to allow it. Your Lordship therefore might
without any prejudice to those Declarations
of good Will and Favour you have for the
<hi>Author of the Essay of Humane Vnderstanding,</hi>
have spared the mentioning his quoting Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
that are in Print, for matters of Fact,
to quite another purpose, <hi>as going about to
invalidate the Argument,</hi> for a Deity <hi>from the
universal consent of Mankind,</hi> since he leaves
that <hi>universal consent</hi> as entire, and as large
as you your self do, or can own, or suppose
it. But here I <hi>have no reason to be sorry that</hi>
your Lordship <hi>has given me this occasion for
the Vindication of</hi> this Passage of my Book,
if there should be any one besides your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
who should so far mistake it, as to
think it in the least <hi>invalidates the Argument</hi>
for a God, <hi>from the universal consent of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because you question the credibility
of those Authors I have quoted, which you
say in the next Paragraph,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 89.</note> 
               <hi>were very ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chosen:</hi>
I will crave leave to say, That he
whom I relied on for his Testimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Hotentots</hi> of <hi>Soldania,</hi> was no
less a Man, than an Ambassador from the
King of <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Great Mogul.</hi> Of
whose Relation Monsieur <hi>Thevenot,</hi> no ill
Judge in the Case, had so great an Esteem,
that he was at the pains to translate it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
French, and publish it in his (which is
counted no unjudicious) Collection of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.
But to intercede with your Lordship
for a little more favourable allowance of
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:65912:244"/>
Credit to Sir <hi>Thomas Roe</hi>'s Relation, <hi>Coore,</hi>
an Inhabitant of the Country who could
speak English, assured<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Terry</hi>'s Voyage, p. 17. &amp; 23.</note> Mr. <hi>Terry,</hi> That
they of <hi>Soldania</hi> had no God. But if he too
have the ill luck to find no Credit with you,
I hope you will be a little more favourable to
a Divine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> now liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and admit of his Testimony in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Sir <hi>Tho. Roe</hi>'s. This worthy
Gentleman, in the Relation of his Voyage
to <hi>Suratt,</hi> printed but two Years since, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the same People, has these Words,<note n="†" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ovington,</hi> p. 487.</note>
               <hi>They are sunk even below Idolatry, are destitute
of both Priest and Temple, and saving a little
Shew of rejoycing, which is made at the full and
new Moon, have lost all kind of religious Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Nature has so richly provided for their
Convenience in this Life, that they have drowned
all Sense of the God of it, and are grown quite
careless of the next.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to provide against the clearest Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Atheism in these People, you say,
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Answ. p. 90.</note> 
               <hi>That the Account given of them makes them
not fit to be a Standard for the Sense of Mankind.</hi>
This, I think, may pass for nothing, till
some Body be found, that <hi>makes them to be a
Standard for the Sense of Mankind:</hi> All the use
I made of them was to shew, That there
were Men in the World, that had no innate
Idea of a God. But to keep something like
an Argument going (for what will not that
do?) you go near denying those <hi>Cafers</hi> to be
Men, what else do these Words signifie?<note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note>
               <hi>A People so strangely bereft of Common Sense,
that they can hardly be reckon'd among Mankind,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:65912:244"/>
as appears by the best Accounts of the</hi> Cafers <hi>of</hi>
Soldania, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I hope if any of them were
called <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> or <hi>Iohn,</hi> it would be
past Scruple that they were <hi>Men,</hi> however
<hi>Courvee, Wewena,</hi> and <hi>Cousheda,</hi> and those
others who had Names, that had no place in
your <hi>Nomenclator,</hi> would hardly pass Muster
with your Lordship.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I should not mention this, but
that what you your self say here may be a
Motive to you to consider, That what you
have laid such Stress on concerning the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Nature of Man,</hi> as a <hi>real Being and the
Subject of Properties,</hi> amounts to nothing for
the distinguishing of <hi>Species,</hi> since you your
self own that there may be <hi>Individuals where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there is a common Nature with a particular
Subsistence proper to each of them,</hi> whereby you
are so little able to know of which of the
<hi>Ranks</hi> or <hi>Sorts</hi> they are, into which you say,
<note n="*" place="margin">P. 165.</note> 
               <hi>God has order'd Beings,</hi> and which he <hi>hath
distinguished by essential Properties,</hi> that you
are in doubt whether <hi>they ought to be reckon'd
among Mankind or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Give me leave now to think, my Lord,
That I have given an Answer to all, that is
any way material in either of the Letters
you have honoured me with. If there be
any Argument which you think of weight,
that you find omitted, upon the least Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
from your Lordship where it is, I
promise to consider it, and to endeavour to
give you Satisfaction concerning it, either
by owning my Conviction, or shewing what
hinders it. This Respect I shall think due
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:65912:245"/>
from me to your Lordship: Though I know
better to imploy the little Time my Business
and Health afford me, than to trouble my
self with the little Cavillers, who may either
be set on, or be forward (in hope to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
themselves) to meddle in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude, 'tis fit I take notice of
the Obligation I have to you, for the Pains
you have been at about my <hi>Essay,</hi> which I
conclude could not have been any way so
effectually recommended to the World, as
by your manner of writing against it. And
since your Lordship's sharp Sight, so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
employ'd for its Correction, has, as I
humbly conceive, found no Faults in it,
which your Lordships great Endeavours this
way have made out to be really there, I hope
I may presume it will pass the better in the
World, and the Judgment of all considering
Men, and make it for the future stand better
even in your Lordship's Opinion. I beg
