            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The weakest performances of grace find
acceptance with him, though clog'd with
many sinful weaknesses and infirmities, <hi>Heb.</hi>
11. 31, 32. if God so prize it, well may we:

to it all over the professing world, shew what
a most precious and desirable thing it is: if
there were not some singular glory in it, why
doth every one covet to be reputed graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
nay the <hi>Devil</hi> himself baits many of his
hooks of temptation with a shew of grace:
for he knows sin hath no native beauty of its
own to entice; and therefore he borrows the
paint and pretence of holiness, to cover it:
but O what a <hi>dilemma</hi> will the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> be
posed with at last? and how can he answer
it when God shall demand.</p>
                  <p>If grace were evil, why didst thou so affect

<hi>scope</hi> of all their <hi>endeavours,</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> of their

Precious Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Infer.</hi> 1. Is saving grace more precious than
Gold? <hi>Let them that have it bless God for it,
&amp; not boast:</hi> Mens hearts are as apt to puff up
and swell with <hi>spiritual,</hi> as with <hi>material</hi> gold:
it's hard to be an owner of much of this
<hi>gold,</hi> and not be lifted up with it. To keep
down thy heart, and preserve thine eyes
from being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dazled with these their graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
excellencies; it will be needful for thee
Christian sometime to consider,</p>
                  <p>That altho' Grace be one of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
things that ever God created, yet it is
<hi>but a Creature,</hi> a dependent thing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
                  <p>Yea, it is not only a Creature, but a very
imperfect creature yet in thy soul; labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under many weaknesses, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. and
sometimes ready to die, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
                  <p>Though it can do many things for you,
yet it cannot Justifie you before God: you
cannot make a garment of to cover your
guilt, not plead the dignity of it at Gods bar
for your discharge; 'tis not your <hi>inherent,</hi> but
Christs <hi>imputed righteousness</hi> must do that for
you; though in other respects it be very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:109043:28"/>
Nay, remember; how excellent soever it
be, it's not the native growth and product of
your hearts; all the grace you have is foraign
to your Natures; and what you have, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                  <p>And Lastly, remember he that is most
proud and conceited of his own graces, will
be found to be the owner of least grace, and
hath most cause to question, whether he have
any or no. It's the nature of grace to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
abase and empty the Soul; and it's the

                     <hi>Infer.</hi> 2. Is Saving Grace more excellent
than gold? <hi>what cause then have the poorest
Christians to be well satisfied with their lot?</hi> To
others God hath given <hi>Ishmael</hi>'s portion the
fatness of the <hi>Earth;</hi> to you <hi>Isaac</hi>'s, the graces
of their Covenant: the portion is paid in
<hi>brass,</hi> yours in <hi>gold:</hi> many of you are <hi>poor in
the World,</hi> but <hi>rich in faith; and heirs of the
Kingdom which God hath promised,</hi> Jam. 2. 5.
what is the <hi>dust</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> to the <hi>fruits</hi>
of the <hi>Spirit?</hi> you are troubled that you have no
more of the World; it may be if you had more
<hi>gold,</hi> you would have less <hi>grace:</hi> you consider
not how many are poor &amp; wretched in both
worlds; <hi>moneyless,</hi> and <hi>Christless</hi> too: you don't
consider you are near come to that state, in
which all your wants will be fully supply'd;
where you shall not need the treasures of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109043:29"/>
Earth, and have your desires satisfied out of
the treasures of grace and glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Infer.</hi> 3. Is Saving Grace <hi>Gold,</hi> yea infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more precious than Gold? <hi>then surely
declining Christians are great losers, and have
cause to be great mourners.</hi> The remission of the
least degree of <hi>Grace,</hi> is more to be lamented
than the loss of the greatest sum of <hi>Gold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the habits of Grace be not lost;
yet the <hi>Acts</hi> of Grace may be suspended,
<hi>2 Sam</hi> 12. 31. The <hi>degrees</hi> of grace may be
<hi>remitted, Rev.</hi> 3. 3. The <hi>evidences</hi> of grace
may be <hi>clouded,</hi> and <hi>consequently</hi> the <hi>Comforts</hi>
of grace may be <hi>suspended,</hi> Isa. 50. 10. and the
least of these is such a loss, as all the treasures
of the Earth cannot repair: well therefore
may declined Christians challenge the first
place among all the mourners in the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Infer.</hi> 4. Is grace so invaluably precious?
<hi>How precious then ought the ordinances of God to
be to our souls, by which grace is first communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and afterwards improved in our souls! The
law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands
of gold and silver,</hi> Psal. 119. 72. and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
whilest it <hi>imparts</hi> and <hi>improves</hi> that to

                  <p>None but those that value not Grace, will
ever slight the <hi>means,</hi> or despite and injure
the <hi>instruments</hi> thereof. It's a sad sign of a
graceless world, when these precious things
fall under contempts and slights.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:109043:29"/>
                     <hi>Infer.</hi> 5. If Grace be so precious <hi>how watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
should all gracious persons be in the dates of
temptation!</hi> the design of temptation is to
rob you of your treasure: when <hi>Cut-purses</hi> get
into the croud, we use to say; Friends, look
to your purses. How many brave Christians
have we read and heard of, that have rather
chosen to part with their <hi>lives,</hi> than with
their <hi>graces,</hi> who have <hi>resisted unto blood, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
against sin?</hi> Heb. 12. 4.</p>
                  <p>O Christians, you live in a cheating Age,
many <hi>seeming</hi> Christians have lost <hi>all,</hi> and
many <hi>real</hi> Christians have lost <hi>much</hi> so much,
that they are like to see but little comfort in
this World: who are like to go mourning to
the Grave with that Lamentation, <hi>Iob.</hi> 29.
2, 3. <hi>O that it were with me as in times past!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Infer.</hi> 6. To Conclude. Is there such precious
worth in saving Grace? <hi>then bless God for, and
diligently use all means to increase and improve
it in your souls.</hi> It's Gold for preciousness, and
for usefulness; and must not be laid up in a
Napkin: that's a sin condemned by the very
scope of that <hi>Parable,</hi> Mat. 25. 14, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All Christians indeed have not the same
advantages of improvement, but all must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it according to the advantages they
have in order to an account. <hi>Reserved Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
who live too abstracted from the Society
and Communion of others, and disperse not
their streams abroad to the benefit of others;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109043:30"/>
nor improve the graces of others for their
own benefit, are wanting both to their own
duty and comfort. See you a Man rich in
<hi>grace;</hi> O trade with him if you can, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
your selves by him; and the rather,
because you know not how soon death may
snatch him from you, and with him all his
stock of Grace is gone from you too, except
what you made your own whilst you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with him: but alas, alas! instead of
<hi>holy</hi> profitable soul-improving communion,
some are sullenly reserved; some are negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and lazy; some are litigious and wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
more apt to draw forth the dross, than
the Gold; I mean the Corruptions, than
Graces of others. And how few there be that
drive a profitable trade for increase of grace,
is sad to consider.</p>
                  <p>And as grace is not improved by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with <hi>men,</hi> so I doubt most Christians
thrive but little in their communion with
<hi>God:</hi> we are too seldom in our <hi>Closets,</hi> too
little upon our <hi>knees,</hi> and when we are there,
we gain but little, we come not off such
gainers by duty as we might. O Christians,
think when you are hearing, and praying,
I am now trading with Heaven for that
which is infinitely better than Gold. God is
rich to all that call upon him, what a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
may I get this hour, if the fault be not
in my one heart? And thus of the second
observation.</p>

                  <p>THE most wise God hath seen
it fit to set all his people in a
state of tryal in this world. First, he <hi>tryes,</hi> and
then he <hi>Crowns</hi> them. Jam. 1. 12. <hi>Blessed is

probation or tryal] <hi>for when he is tryed, he
shall receive the crown of life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>No man can say what he is, whether his
graces be true or false, till they be tryed and
examined by those things which are to them
as fire is to gold. These self-deceivers in the
<hi>Text,</hi> thought they had grace; yea they
thought they had been rich in grace; but
it proved no better than <hi>dross:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Christ</hi> here counsels them to <hi>buy of him
gold tryed in the fire,</hi> (i. e.) true grace indeed,
which appears to be so upon the various
proofs and examinations of its sincerity
which are to be made in this world, as well
as in the great solemn tryal it must come
to in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures speak of a twofold tryal,
<hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>opinions</hi> and Judgments of
men are tryed as by fire, in which sense we
are to understand that place, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 12, 13.
Now if any man build upon this foundation,
gold, silver, precious stones; wood, hay, stubble
every mans work shall be made manifest, for the
day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed
by fire, and the fire shall try every mans work of
what sort it is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>text</hi> speaks of such persons as hold
the foundation of Christianity, but yet
superstructed such doctrines and practices,
as were no more able to endure the Tryal,
than <hi>hay,</hi>

                     <hi>wood,</hi> or <hi>stubble</hi>
can endure the fire. Such
a person hereby brings
himself into danger, and though the <hi>Apostle</hi>
will not deny the <hi>possibllity,</hi> yet he asse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ts the
<hi>difficulty</hi> of his salvation: <hi>he
shall be saved,</hi>

                     <hi>yet so as by fire,
(i. e.)</hi> as a man is saved by

at last.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>graces</hi> of men are brought
to the test as well as their opinions. Tryal
will be made of their <hi>hearts,</hi> as well as of their
<hi>heads;</hi> and upon this tryal the everlasting
safety &amp; happiness of the person depends: if
a mans opinions be some of them found hay
or stubble, yet so long as he holds the head, &amp;
is right in the foundation, he may be saved;
but if a mans supposed graces be found so, all
the world cannot save him: there is no way
of escape if he finally deceive himself herein:
and of this tryal of <hi>Graces</hi> my text speaks:
Sincere Grace is Gold tryed by fire.</p>
                  <p>There is a twofold tryal of grace, Active,
and Passive.</p>
                  <p>First, an <hi>Active</hi> tryal of it, in which we try
it our selves, 2 <hi>Cor. 13 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Examine your selves,
prove your selves:</hi> (i. e.) measure your <hi>hearts,
duties</hi> and <hi>graces</hi> by the rule of the word;
see how they answer to that rule, bring your
hearts and the word together by solemn self-examination:
confer with your reins, and
commune with your own hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A <hi>Passive</hi> tryal of it: whether
we try it or no, God will t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our gold to the touchstone, and to the fire.

                  <p>The heart of a Christian in the midst
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109043:36"/>
ensnaring sensitive enjoyments finds indeed
a corrupt principle in it, which would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
him to fall asleep upon such a soft
pillow; and forget God and duty: but it
cannot; Oh no, it cannot do so, there's a
principle of grace within him that never
leaves jogging, disturbing, and calling upon
him, till he rise and return to his God the
true rest of his soul.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A false pretender to Religion,
an <hi>Hypocritical Professour</hi> meeting with pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
and success, grows altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned
about the interest of Religion,
&amp; senseless of the calamities of Gods people.
Thus the Prophet convinces the Jews of their
<hi>hypocrisie,</hi> Amos 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>They were
at ease in Zion, and trusted in the Mountain of
Samaria:</hi> and so having a shadow of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and a fulness of all earthly things, they
fell to feasting and sporting: <hi>they drank
wine in bowls, and anointed themselves with
the chief oyntment, but were not grieved for the
affliction of</hi> Joseph: they condoled not <hi>Gnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheber</hi>
over the breakings or tearing to pieces
of <hi>Ioseph;</hi> they are out of danger once, let
the Church shift for it self; they are secure
in a warm nest, let the birds of prey catch
and devour that flock with which they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
associated, they are not toucht with it.
<hi>Moses</hi> could not do so though in the greatest
security, and confluence of the honours and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109043:37"/>
pleasures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Acts 7. 23. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> could
not do so, though the servant and <hi>favorite</hi>
of a mighty <hi>Monarch,</hi> and wanted nothing
to make him outwardly happy: Yet the
pleasures of a <hi>Kings Court</hi> could not cheer
his heart, or scatter the clouds of sorrow
from his Countenance, whilest his brethren
were in affliction, &amp; the City of his God lay
waste, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. nor indeed can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
gracious heart be unconcerned and sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;
for that Union that all the <hi>Saints</hi> have
with <hi>Christ their</hi> head, and with one another
as fellow members in Christ, will <hi>beget sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
among them in their sufferings, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 26.</p>

                  <p>BUT as the fire of prosperity discovers
this, and much more dross in a graceless
heart; so it discovers the sincerity and grace
of Gods people. I say not that it discovers
nothing but grace in them. O that it did
not! alas! many of them have had a
great deal of dross and corruption discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by it, as was noted before: but yet in
this Tryal, the graciousness and uprightness
of their hearts will appear in these and such
like workings of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1. First,</hi> Under prosperity, success and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
the upright heart will labour to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
pride, and keep it self lowly &amp; humble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:109043:37"/>
and still the more grace there is, the more
humility there will be. If God lift him up,
he will lay himself low, and exalt his God
high. So did <hi>Iacob</hi> when God had raised &amp;
enlarged him, Gen. 32. 10. <hi>I am not worthy
of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth
which thou hast shewed unto thy servant, for
with my staff I passed over this Iordan, and now
I am become two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Great was the difference in <hi>Iacobs</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
condition at his return, from what it
was at first passage over <hi>Iordan:</hi> then poor,
now rich; then single and comfortless, now
the head of a great family. Yea, but though
his outward estate was altered, the frame
of his heart was not altered. <hi>Iacob</hi> was an
holy and humble man when he went out, &amp;
so he was when he returned: he saw a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of mercies about him, and among them
all, not one but was greater than himself.</p>
                  <p>I dare not say every Christian under pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
can at all times manifest like humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but I am sure what pride and vanity so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may rise in a gracious heart tryed by
prosperity, there's that within him, will give
check to it: he dare not suffer such proud
thoughts to lodge quietly in his heart: for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>as
he sees that in himself, and that in his
God that will abase him; grace will make
him <hi>look back</hi> to his original condition, &amp; say
with <hi>David, What am I O Lord God, and what
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109043:38"/>
is my fathers house; that thou hast brought me
hitherto?</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 18.</p>
                  <p>It will make him look in, &amp; see the base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his own heart, and the Corruptions
that are there, and admire at the Dealings of
God with so vile a Creature. O thinks he, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
others did but know what I know of my self
they would abhor me more than now they
esteem and value me.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Secondly, Prosperity</hi> usually draws forth
the Saints love to the God of their mercies
that which heats a wicked mans <hi>lusts,</hi> warm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
a gracious mans <hi>heart</hi> with love and delight
in God.</p>
                  <p>These were the words of that lovely song
which <hi>David</hi> sang in the day that the Lord
delivered him out of the hand of all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
and from the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> and he
said, <hi>I will love thee O Lord my strength<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
Psalm 18. Title and v. 1. compared:</hi> these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things are not the main grounds and
motives of their love to God; no, no, they
love him when he takes away, as well, as when
he gives: but they are sanctified instrument<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
to inflame their love to God: they <hi>boyle</hi> up
a wicked mans <hi>lusts,</hi> but they <hi>melt</hi> a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
mans soul. O in what a pang of love
did <hi>David</hi> go into the presence of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the sense of his mercies? <hi>his melting mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;</hi>
when he thus poured out his whole
soul in a stream of love to his God, 2 <hi>Sam
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:109043:38"/>
7. 19, 20. Is this the manner of men, O Lord
God! and what can David say more unto thee!</hi>
an expression that turns up the very bottom
of his heart.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Thirdly, Prosperity</hi> and comfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
do usually become <hi>cautions</hi> against
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in when they meet with a sanctified soul.
This is the natural inference of a gracious
soul from them, Hath God pleased me, then
hath he obliged me to take more care to
please him. O let me not grieve him, that
hath comforted me. So <hi>Ezra 9. 13. After
such a deliverance, as this, should we again break
thy Commandments!</hi> what! break his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
who hath broken our bonds!
God forbid.</p>
                  <p>It was an excellent resolution of a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
once, who receiving an eminent mercy,
at the same time he felt himself under the
power of a special Corruption; Well, (saith
he) now will I go forth in the strength of
this mercy to mortifie and subdue that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
I will not measure every Christian
by the eminent workings of grace in some
one; but surely so far I may safely go, That
sincerity knows not how to sin, because grace
hath abounded, any more than it dare sin,
that grace may abound.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A truly gracious soul will not
be satisfied with all the prosperity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
in the world for his portion. <hi>Not thine
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109043:39"/>
Lord, but thee</hi> is the voice of grace: when
providence had been more than ordinarily
bountiful in outward things to <hi>Luther,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be afraid of its meaning, and earnestly
protested, God should not put him off so. <hi>The
Lord is my portion saith my soul,</hi> Lam 3. 2, 4.
and the soul can best tell what it hath made
its choice, and whereon it hath bestowed its
chief delights and expectations.</p>
                  <p>An unsound heart will accept these for its
portion: if the world be sure to him, and
his designs fail not there; he can be content
to leave God, and soul, and heaven, and hell
at hazard: but so cannot the upright. These
things in <hi>subordination;</hi> but neither these, nor
any thing under the Sun in <hi>Comparison</hi> with,
or <hi>opposition</hi> to God.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:109043:39"/>
God, <hi>I will melt them, and try them; for what

here Affliction is the Furnace, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are the metal cast into it; and the end of
it is Tryal. <hi>I will melt them and try them;</hi>
what other course shall I take with them? If
I let them alone, their Lusts like the rust and
Canker in metals will eat them out. Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
multiplies Professors, &amp; adversity brings
them to the test: then <hi>Hirelings</hi> quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>changlings:</hi> the gilded <hi>potshard</hi> glisters
till it come to scouring. The Devil thought
<hi>Iob</hi> had been such a one, and moves that he
may be tried this way; being consident he
would be found but dross in the tryal, <hi>Iob 1.
11.</hi> But tho' the Furnace of Affliction disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
some dross in him, (as it will in the
best of men) yet he came forth as gold.</p>
                  <p>In this Furnace also grace is manifested:
'tis said, <hi>Rev. 13. 10. Here is the patience and
faith of the Saints:</hi> (i. e.) here is the trial and
discovery of it in these days of Adversity. It
was a weighty saying of <hi>Tetullian</hi> to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors
of the Church in his days, <hi>probatio
innocentiae nostrae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tertul. in Apol.</note> 
                     <hi>est iniquitas

trial of our innocency. <hi>Constantius</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Constantine</hi> made an exploratory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
that all who would not renounce the

the <hi>dross</hi> from the <hi>gold;</hi> which was his

and thereupon were renounced by him;

                  <p>In time of Prosperity, Hypocrisie lies co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the heart like <hi>nests</hi> in the green

made them bare, every body may see them
without searching.</p>
                  <p>But to fall into closer particulars, it will
be necessary to enquire what effects of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
are common to both the sound, and
the unsound; and then what are proper to
either in this close trial by Adversity.</p>

                  <p>IT will be expedient to the design I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
in this discourse, to shew in the first
place what are common effects of adversity
to both the godly and ungodly, for in some
things they differ not, but as it is with the
one, so also with the other: as,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1. First,</hi> Both the godly and ungodly may
fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Adversity before it comes. To be sure
a wicked man cannot, and it's evident ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
godly men do not come up to the height
of that rule, <hi>Iam. 1. 2. To account it all Ioy
when they fall into divers temptations,</hi> or trials
by Adversity.</p>
                  <p>'Tis said, <hi>Isa. 33. 14. The sinners in Sion are
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109043:40"/>
afraid, trembling surprizeth the Hypocrite.</hi>
Namely, under the apprehension of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
calamities: and it's true also, the <hi>Saints
in Sion</hi> may be afraid: <hi>my flesh trembleth for
fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgements;</hi>
said holy <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 119. 120. &amp; <hi>Iob 3. 23.
The thing which I greatly feared</hi> (saith that
upright soul) <hi>is come upon me:</hi> there is a vast
difference betwixt a Saints first meeting
with afflictions, and his parting with them:
he entertains them sometimes with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
he parts with them rejoycing, smiling
on them, and blessing them in the name of
the Lord. So that by this the upright, and
the false heart, are not discriminated: even
sanctified nature declines sufferings and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Both the godly and ungodly
may entertain afflictions with regret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness
when they come: afflictions and
troubles are Wormwood and Gall, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 19.
and that goes not down pleasantly with flesh
and blood, <hi>Heb. 12. 11. No affliction for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the
present seemeth joyous, but grievous;</hi> he means
to God's own People. They are <hi>in beaviness</hi>
through manifold temptations or trials by
the rod: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6. When God gives the cup
of affliction into the hands of the wicked,
how do they reluctate and loath it? How
do their stomachs rise at it? And though the
portion of the Saints cup be much sweeter
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109043:41"/>
than theirs, (for that bitter ingredient of
Gods vindictive wrath is not in it) yet even
they shrink from it, and loth they are to
taste it.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Thirldly,</hi> Both the one and other may
be impatient and fretful in adversity: it's
the very nature of flesh and blood to be so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>The wicked are like the troubled sea which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose waters cast forth mire and dirt,</hi>
Isa. 57. 20. It's an allusion to the unstable
and stormy <hi>Ocean:</hi> You know there is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
an estuation, and working in the Sea,
whether it be incensed by the wind or no;
but if a violent wind blow upon the unquiet
<hi>Ocean,</hi> Oh what raging and foaming is there!
what abundance of trash and filth doth it at
such times cast out!</p>
                  <p>Now, though grace make a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt one and another, yet I dare
not say, but even a gracious heart may be
very unquiet and tumultuous in the day of
affliction. Sanctified souls have their Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Lusts which are too little mortified,
even as <hi>Sweet-bryar,</hi> and <hi>Holy-thistles</hi> have
their prickles, as well as the worthless bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<hi>Ionah</hi> was a good Man, yet his Soul was
sadly distempered by adverse providences:
<hi>Ionah 4. 9. Yea</hi> (saith he, and that to his God)
<hi>I do well to be angry, even unto death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Both the one and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ther
may be weary of the rod, and think the day
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:109043:41"/>
of adversity a tedious day, wishing it were
once at an end. <hi>Babylon</hi> shall be weary of
the evil that God will bring upon it, <hi>Ier 51.
ult,</hi> and oh that none of <hi>Sions Children</hi> were
weary of adversity too! How sad a moan
doth <hi>Iob</hi> make of his long continued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
<hi>Iob 16. 6, 7. though I speak, my grief
is not asswaged, and though I forbear, what am
I eased? but now he hath made me weary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if you look into <hi>Psal. 6. 3, 6.</hi> you may
see another strong Christian even tyred in
the way of affliction: <hi>My soul</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>
in that place) <hi>is sore vexed, but thou O Lord
how long! I am weary with my groaning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Both the one and other may be
driven to their knees by adversity. <hi>Lord in
trouble have they visited thee, they have poured
out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them,</hi>
Isa. 26. 16. Not that a godly person will pray
no longer than the rod is at his back; O no,
he cannot live without prayer long, how
few calls soever he hath to that duty by the
rod: but when the rod is on his <hi>back,</hi> he will
be more frequently, and more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ervently
upon his <hi>knees:</hi> indeed many graceless heart
are like <hi>Childrens Tops</hi> which will go no
longer than they are whipt; they canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
find their knees and their tongues, till Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
find a rod to excite them. A dangerous <hi>symp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tome.</hi>
The same affliction may put a gracious
and a graceless soul to their knees; but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

in the external matter of duty, and in the
external call or occasion of duty they seem
to agree; yet is there a vast difference in the
principles, manner, and ends of these their
duties; as will evidently appear in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place in our following discourse.</p>
                  <p>But by what hath been said in this <hi>Section</hi>
you may see how in some things the holy
upright soul acts too like the unsanctified,
and in other things how much the <hi>Hypocrite</hi>
may act like a Saint: he may be externally
humbled, so was <hi>Ahab:</hi> he may pray under
the rod, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 13. yea and request others
to pray for him, so did <hi>Simon,</hi> Acts 8. 24.</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. III.</head>
                  <p>BUt though the sound and unsond heart
differ not in some external carriages
under the rod; yet there are effects of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
which are proper to either, and will
discriminate them. To which end let us
first see what effects adversity is usually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
withal in unsound and carnal hearts:
and we shall find among other, these <hi>five
symptomes</hi> of a naughty heart appearing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
crosses and afflictions.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> A Graceless heart is not quickly
and easily brought to see the hand of God
in those troubles that befall it, and be duly
affected with it, <hi>Isa. 26. 11. Lord when thy
hand is lifted up they will not see:</hi> when it hath
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:109043:42"/>
smitten, or is lifted up to smite, they shut
their eyes: 'tis the malice of this man, or the
negligence of that, or the unfaithfulness of
another that hath brought all this trouble
upon me: thus the Creature is the <hi>Horizon</hi>
that terminates their sight, and beyond that
they usually see nothing: sometimes indeed
the hand of God is so immediately mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,
and convincingly discovered in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
that they cannot avoid the sight of
it, and then they may (in their way) pour
out a prayer before him, but ordinarily they
impute all to second causes, and overlook
the first cause of their troubles.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nor is it usual with these Men
under the rod to retire into their Closets,
and search their hearts there; to find out the
particular cause and provocation of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction:
<hi>No man repented him of his wickedness,
saying what have I done?</hi> Jer. 8. 6. what cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thing is there with me, that hath thus
incensed the anger of God against me?
God visits their iniquities with <hi>afflictions,</hi> but
they visit not their own hearts by <hi>self-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</hi>
God judges them, but they judge
not themselves; he shews their iniquities in
a clear glass, but none saith, <hi>What have I
done?</hi> This phrase, <hi>What have I done?</hi> is the
voice of one that recollects himself after a
rash action; or the voice of a Man astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the discovery afflictions make of his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:109043:43"/>
sins, but no such voice as this is ordinarily
heard among carnal Men.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An unsound Professor if le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t to
his choice, would rather chuse <hi>Sin</hi> than <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;</hi>
and sees more evil in that, than in
this.</p>
                  <p>And it cannot be doubted if we consider,
the principle by which all unregenerate
Men are acted, is <hi>sense</hi> not <hi>faith:</hi> hence <hi>Iobs</hi>
friends would have argued his Hypocrisie,
<hi>Iob</hi> 36. 21. and had their <hi>application</hi> been as
their <hi>rule,</hi> it would have concluded it. <hi>This</hi>
(<hi>viz.</hi> Sin) <hi>hast thou chosen, rather than affliction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not say that an upright man cannot
commit a <hi>moral</hi> evil, to escape a <hi>poenal</hi> evil.
O that daily observation did not too plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
furnish us with sad instances of that
kind! but upright ones do not, dare not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a serious deliberate discussion and debate
chuse sin rather than affliction; what they
may do upon surprisals, and in the violence
of temptation is of another nature.</p>
                  <p>But a false and unsound heart discovers it
self in the choice it makes upon deliberation,
and that frequently, when sin and trouble
come in competition: put case, saith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi>
a <hi>Ruffian</hi> should with one hand set the
cup of drunkenness to thy mouth, &amp; with the
other a dagger to thy breast; and say, <hi>drink
or die:</hi> thou shouldst rather chuse to die so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
than to live a <hi>drunkard:</hi> and many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109043:43"/>
have resisted unto blood striving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sin, and with renowned <hi>Moses</hi> chosen
affliction, the worst of afflictions; yea death
it self in the most formidable appearance,
rather than sin: and it is the habitual tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and resolution of every gracious heart so
to do, tho' those holy resolutions are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
over-born by violence of temptation.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> dreads less the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ilement
of his soul, than the loss of his estate, liberty
or life. If you ask upon what ground then
doth the Apostle suppose, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. a man
may give his body to be burnt, and not have
charity? that the <hi>Salamander</hi> of Hypocrisie
may live in the flame of <hi>Martyrdom?</hi> The
answer is at hand, they that chose death in
the sense of this Text, do not chose it to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
sin, but to seed and indulge it. Those
strange adventures (if any such be) are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to maintain their own honour, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol
their names among worthy and famous
Persons to Posterity; or out of a blind zeal
to their espoused erours and mistakes; than
in a due regard to the
glory of God,<note place="margin">Timeo dicere, sed dicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum est; martyrium ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum si ideo fiat ut admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationi &amp; laudi habea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur à fratribus; frustr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a <hi>beam (i. e.)</hi> a great horrid flagitious evil in
himself; but it is too near him to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
or bewailed: this is a sad <hi>symptome</hi>
of a naughty heart.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He may hate it in its <hi>effects,</hi> &amp;
<hi>consequents;</hi> not in its own <hi>nature:</hi> as the
<hi>Thief</hi> hates the <hi>Gallows,</hi> not the wickedness
that he hath done. It is not sin in it self,
but sin in its connection with <hi>Hell,</hi> that is
frightful to him.</p>
                  <p>The unsound professour could wish that
there were no such threatnings in the <hi>Bible</hi>
against sin: when sin tempts him, I would
saith he, but I fear the consequence. O sin,
could I separate thee from <hi>hell,</hi> nothing should
separate thee and me.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He may hate it in a <hi>mood</hi> or
<hi>pang,</hi> but not with a <hi>rooted habitual</hi> hatred.
It's plain from 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. that sin may
sometimes lye upon the conscience of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
man, as a load lyes upon a sick
<hi>stomach;</hi> and so he may discharge himself
of it, by reformation, restitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but a
little time reconciles the quarrel betwixt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109043:53"/>
him and his Lust again: if they fall out they
will fall in again; <hi>the dog is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>turned to his
vomit, and the sow that was washed, to her
wallowing in the mire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But an upright soul hates sin in another
manner, and in this hatred of sin <hi>the Children
of God are manifest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> the opposition of sin to God, is the
very ground and formal reason upon which
a gracious soul opposes and hates it: if it be
opposite to the holy <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
it cannot but be odious in his eyes: This
put <hi>Davids</hi> heart, <hi>Psal. 51. 4. Against thee,
thee only have I sinned: q. d.</hi> I have wronged
<hi>Uriah</hi> greatly, I have wronged my self and
family greatly; but the wrong I have done
to others is not worth naming, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the wrong I have done to thee.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The upright soul hates sin <hi>in
himself,</hi> more than he hates it <hi>in any other:</hi>
as a man hates a <hi>Serpent</hi> in the <hi>hedge,</hi> but
much more in his own <hi>bosome:</hi> Rom. 7 23.
<hi>But I see another Law in my members:</hi> and ver.
21. <hi>I find then a Law, that when I would do
good, evil is present with me: q. d.</hi> I'don't
know how others find it, but I am sure I
find sin in my very <hi>bosome,</hi> in my very <hi>bowels,</hi>
it is <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sent with me. O wretched man that I
am!</hi> a gracious soul can mourn to see in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but to find it in himself, pierceth him
to the very heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:109043:54"/>
3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The gracious soul hates not
only this or that <hi>particular sin,</hi> but the <hi>whole
kind,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Arist. Rhet. lib. 2. cap. 4.</note> every thing that is sinful.
True hatred is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, of
the whole nature or kind, <hi>Psal.
119. 104. I hate every false way;</hi> his reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
proceed <hi>à quatenus ad omne,</hi> from sin,
as sin; concluding against every sin. Sins
that are profitable, and pleasant, as well as
sins that have neither profit nor pleasure:
sins that are <hi>secret</hi> as well as sins that are <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,</hi>
and will defame him.</p>
                  <p>And before this tryal a false heart cannot
stand; for he alwayes indulges to some Lust:
there is an iniquity which he cannot be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The sincere soul <hi>hates</hi> sin with
an <hi>irreconcileable hatred:</hi> there was a time
when sin and his soul fell out, but there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
will be a time of reconciliation betwixt
them again.</p>
                  <p>That breach which effectual conviction
once made, can never be made up any more:
<hi>they will return no more to folly,</hi> Psal. 85. 8. &amp;
indeed it seems to them that have suffered
so much for sin, that have endured so many
fears and sorrows for it; the <hi>greatest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
in the world to return to sin again: no, no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they admire the mercy of their escape
from sin, to their dying day; and neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> look
back upon their former state but with shame
and grief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:109043:54"/>
Ask a <hi>Convert,</hi> would you be back again
where once you were? would you be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
your old companions again? would
you be fulfilling the lusts of the flesh again?
and he will tell you he would not run the
hazard to abide one day or one night in
that condition again, to gain all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the world the next morning.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The sincere soul hates sin with
a <hi>superlative hatred:</hi> he hates it more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other evil in the world besides it. <hi>Penal</hi>
evils are not pleasant themselves, but yet if
he must endure them, or sin; then suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to chuse: <hi>Heb. 11. 25. Chusing rather to
suffer affliction than enjoy the pleasures of sin;</hi>
the worst of sufferings, rather than the best
of sin.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To conclude, so deep is the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
that upright ones bear to sin, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
pleases them more than the thoughts
of a full deliverance from it doth: <hi>Rom. 7.
34. I thank God, through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
What doth he so heartily thank God for?
O for a prospect of his final deliverance
from sin, never to be intangled, defiled, or
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>roubled with it any more: and this is one
thing that sweetens death to the Saints, as
much as any thing in the world can do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Christs victory over it, and lying in the
grave for us. To think of a <hi>grave</hi> is not
pleasant in it self, but to think of a parting
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:109043:55"/>
time with sin, that's sweet and pleasant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>

that sin is the matter of mens shame, &amp;
that all are not arrived to that height of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
to declare their sin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in their shame;</hi> but to be ashamed only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
men see it, and not with <hi>Ezra</hi> to say,
<hi>O my God I am ashamed, and blush to look up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee,</hi> Ezra 9. 6. ashamed that thou seest it,
is but Hypocrisie.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A graceless heart may be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for the <hi>rod</hi> that sin draws after it, but
not for sin it self as it provokes God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
such rods.</p>
                  <p>But the troubles of <hi>upright ones</hi> for sin are
of another kind and nature.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> They are troubled that God is
wronged, &amp; his Spirit troubled by their sins.
So the penitent <hi>Prodigal, I have sinned against
heaven, and in thy sight,</hi> Luk. 15. 21. Against
heaven, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> against him whose Throne is
in Heaven, a great, glorious, and infinite
Majesty: a poor worm of the Earth, hath
lifted up his hand against the God of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are troubled for the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement</hi>
of their own souls by sin: hence they
are compared in <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 26. to <hi>a troubled
fountain;</hi> you know it's the property of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
spring when any filth falls into it, or
that which lies in the bottom of its chanel
is raised and defiles its streams, never to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:109043:56"/>
leave working till it have purged it self of
it, and recovered its purity again.</p>
                  <p>So it is with a righteous man; he loves
purity in the <hi>precept, Psal.</hi> 119. 140. and he
loves it no less in the <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>practice:</hi>
he thinks it is hell enough to lie under the
<hi>pollution</hi> of sin, if he should never come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>damnation</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They are troubled for the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strangements
of God,</hi> and the hiding of his face
from them because of their Sin. It would go
close to an ingenuous spirit to see a dear and
faithful friend whom he hath grieved, to
look strange and shy upon him at the next
meeting; as if he did not know him: much
more doth it go to the heart of a gracious
man to see the face of God turned from him,
and not to be towards him as in times past.
This went to <hi>Davids</hi> heart after his fall, as
you may see, <hi>Psal. 51. 11. Cast me not away from
thy presence, and take not thy holy spirit from me;
q. d.</hi> Lord, if thou turn thy back upon me,
and estrange thy self from me, I am a lost
man: that is the greatest mischief than can
befal me.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Their troubles for sin <hi>run deep,</hi>
to what other Mens do. They are strong to
bear other troubles, but quail and fain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The best Men may fall into sin through
mistake, or be precipitated into sin through
the violence of Temptation; but to <hi>devise
mischief,</hi> and <hi>set himself</hi> in an evil way; this
notes full assent of the mind, and then <hi>not to
abhor evil,</hi> notes full consent of the will, and
these two being given to sin, not only <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently</hi>
to the acting of it; but also <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi>
to it: to like it afterward, as well as
before; this puts the soul fully under the
power of sin; what can it give more?</p>
                  <p>This (as one saith) in direct opposition to
the <hi>Apostle, Rom.</hi> 12. 1. is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

service: all Men by nature are given to sin,
but these men give themselves to it.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The customary practice of sin,
subjects the soul to the Dominion of sin: and
so <hi>he that is born of God, doth not commit sin,</hi>
1 Joh. 3. 9. Fall into sin, yea the same sin he
may, and that often; but then it's not without
reluctance, repentance, and a <hi>protest</hi> ent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed
by the soul in Heaven against it: So that
sin hath not a quiet possession of his Soul; he
is not the <hi>servant of sin,</hi> nor doth he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
walk after its Commandments: but so do
its own Servants; it's their daily practice:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109043:59"/>
                     <hi>Ier. 9. 3. They proceed from evil to evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Thirdly, Delight</hi> in sin proves the <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
of sin. So the Servants of sin are descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
<hi>Isa. 66. 3. They have chosen their own ways,
and their soul delighteth in their abominations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Look as our delight in God is the <hi>measure
of our holiness;</hi> so our delight in sin is <hi>the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of our sinfulness.</hi> Delight in sin is one of
the uppermost rounds of the <hi>Ladder,</hi> &amp; much
higher the soul of a sinner cannot go, till it
be turned off into Hell. <hi>It's a sport to a fool to
do mischief.</hi> Prov. 10. 23. Never merrier than
when he hath the <hi>Devil</hi> for his play-fellow,
saith one upon that place: Mr. <hi>Trap.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Fourthly, Impatience of Christs Yoke and
Government,</hi> argues the soul to be the subject
of sin. This is clear from the <hi>Apostles</hi> reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17, 18. <hi>But God be thanked that
ye were the Servants of sin, but you have obeyed
from the heart the form of doctrine which was
delivered you: being then made free from sin, ye
became the servants of righteousness:</hi> where you
see plainly, that no man can have his <hi>manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
or freedom from sin, that comes not
into Christ's service, and yields himself up
to his obedience.</p>
                  <p>So then to fret at Christ's Laws that tie
us up from our Lusts, to be weary of all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
imployments as a burden intolerable,
never to be in our <hi>Element</hi> and <hi>Centre</hi> till we
are off from God, and plunging in the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109043:60"/>
world, and our lusts; this is a sad note of a
soul in subjection to sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But may not an upright soul find
some weariness in spiritual things?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Doubtless he may, for he hath <hi>flesh</hi>
as well as <hi>spirit,</hi> and tho' the spirit be willing,
the flesh is weak: he is sanctified but in
part, and his delight in the Law of God is
but according to, or <hi>after the inner man, Rom.</hi>
7. 22. but he sees <hi>another law in his members,</hi>
(i.e) contrary inclinations. However, if he
be weary sometimes in the duties of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to be sure he is more weary out of 'em,
and is not <hi>Centred</hi> and at rest till he be with
his God again: But the Carnal heart is where
it would be when it is in the service of sin:
and as a Fish upon dry land, when ingaged
in spiritual duties. Especially such as are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
and have no external allurements of
reputation to engage him to them.</p>
                  <p>But what surprisals or captivities to sin

by these eight following particulars,
that he is not the servant of sin, nor in full

God and their souls do not sensibly meet in

                  <p>Certainly Reader, There is a time when
God comes nigh to men in duty, when he
deals familiarly with men, and sensibly fills
their souls with unusual powers and delights.
The near approaches of God to their souls
are felt by them, (for souls have their senses
as well as bodies;) and now are their minds
abstracted and marvellously refined from all
that is material and earthly, and swallowed
up in spiritual excellencies and glories.</p>
                  <p>These are the real <hi>prelibations</hi> or foretastes
of glory, which no man can by words make
another to understand, as he himself doth
that feels them.</p>
                  <p>These seasons I confess do but rarely occur
to the best of Christians,<note place="margin">Rara hora, brevis mora; fapit quidem sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vissimè, sed gustatur rarissimè. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Sincerity drives but one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and that is to please and enjoy God;
and what can more establish and fix the soul
in the hour of temptations than this? The
reason why the Hypocrite is unstable in all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>his
ways, is given us by the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi>
1. 8. he is a double minded man <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
a man of two souls in one body; as a
prophane wretch once boasted, that he had
one soul for God, another for any thing: but
all the designs of a gracious heart, are united
in one: and so the intire stream of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections runs strong.</p>
                  <p>'Tis base by ends &amp; self-interests, that like
a great many ditches cut out of the bank of
a River, draw away the stream out of its
proper Chanel, and make its waters fail:
but if the heart be united for God as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ion
is, <hi>Psal. 86.</hi> 11. then we may say of
such a <hi>Christian,</hi> as was said of a young <hi>Roman,
quicquid vult,</hi> what he doth, is
done with all his might. And this was the
ground of <hi>valdè valt;</hi> that saying, <hi>liberet me Deus ab <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

design puts to all puts to all his strength to càrry it:
nothing can stand before him.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Sincerity brings a mans will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
subjection to the will of God; and this
being done, the greatest danger and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is over with such a man. This is that
holy oyl, which makes the wheels of the
soul run nimbly even in difficult paths of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
<hi>non tardat uncta rota.</hi> Let but a
man be once brought to that, <hi>The will of the
Lord be done;</hi> as it is, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 13. to see the
highest reason of cheerful obedience in the
holy, just and good will of God; and then
the difficulty is over: he can suffer <hi>quietly,</hi>
what men inflict <hi>unjustly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Sincerity takes its measures of
present things by the rules of fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h, and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
it goes not by the same reckoning &amp;
account that others do, who judge of things
by sense, and the respects they have to the
present world: <hi>2 Cor. 4. 18. We look not
at the things th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

are not seen;</hi> and this is there given as the
reason of his not fainting under present dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties:
so Rom. 8. 18. <hi>I reckon that the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of the present time, are not worthy to be
compared with the glory which shall be revealed
in us:</hi> he will not allow himself to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
eternal glory by once mentioning
present sufferings, in a way of bemoaning
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:109043:79"/>
himself for them: a steady eye upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world makes us more than Conquerours
over the troubles of this world.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> To conclude, Sincerity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
hath all the heavenly aids and assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to stability and perseverance in suffering
times. Upright ones (and such only) have
Christs <hi>intercession</hi> in heaven for them, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 34. The spirits <hi>consolation</hi> in all their
troubles, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14. the spirit of glory &amp;
of God resteth on them: the beneficial <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of Angels,</hi> who are sent forth upon
their account, <hi>Heb. 1. 14. A stock of Prayers</hi>
going for them all the world over, <hi>Eph. 6.
18.</hi> Multitudes of <hi>precious promises</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for every line, word &amp; syllable of which
the faithfulness of God stands engaged: so
that it's impossible such gold can perish in
the fire.</p>
                  <p>And thus of the several ways by which
grace is here tryed.</p>

such probations of his people is,</p>
                  <p>We must conclude in the general, he
certainly designs his own glory, and his

Joy when we fall into divers temptations or

and discovered; The vizard is pluckt off

and in this there is a great deal of good.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> True, some are prejudiced and
hardened by it, so as never to have good
thoughts of the wayes and people of God
more; that's sad indeed, however therein
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:109043:80"/>
God accomplishes his word, and executeth
his decree. And though these perish; yet</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Others are warned, awakened, and
set a searching their own hearts more narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than ever; and this is good: 1 <hi>Cor. 10.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hereby sin is ashamed, and it is

may appear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The turning up the skirt is a modest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of exposing a person to the greatest
shame: in the day of Tryal, God by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
hypocrisie shames the hypocrite: and
surely many such discoveries are made of
men at this day; we may see sin that lurked
close in the heart before, now laid open

                  <p>5. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> By the tryal of our graces <hi>Satan</hi>
is defeated, and his accusations of the Saints
found to be meer slanders. It is a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
thing with the <hi>devil</hi> and wicked men, to
accuse the people of God of Hypocrisie, and
to tell the world they are not the men and
women they are taken to be; and that if their
inside were but turned out by some through
tryal, or deep search, it would appear that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
did not indeed live in their souls as
they pretend; but that they only act a part,
and personate heavenly and mortified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
upon the publick stage of profession.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Accuser of the brethren suggests
the Hypocrisie of <hi>Iob,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 5. <hi>put forth

and he will curse thee to thy face. q. d.</hi> Well
might <hi>Iob</hi> serve thee, whilest thou hast been
so bountiful a master to him; he hath been

thee; but if thou stop the current of his pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity,
thou shalt see how quickly he will stop
the course of his duty: a few lashes from thy
hand, will make him curse thee to thy face:
but O what shame and disappointment was
it to that envious spirit, what a vindication
of <hi>Iobs</hi> integrity, when under the greatest
tryals of his faith and patience, he still held
fast his integrity, and shews himself as great
a pattern of patience under the cross, as he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:109043:83"/>
had been of piety in the days of his greatest
prosperity. Satan gets nothing by bringing

                  <p>6. Sixthly and Lastly, The frequent tryals
of grace, exhibit a full and living Testimony
against the Atheism of the world. These prove
beyond all words or arguments that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is no fancy, but the greatest reality in the
world: men would make Religion but a
fancy, and the zeal of its professours, but the
intemperate heat of some crazy brains, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated
with a fond notion.</p>
                  <p>They that never felt the real influences of
Religion upon their own souls, will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that others do feel them. Serious piety
is become the ludicrous subject with which
the wanton Wits of this Athestical world
sport themselves. But behold the wisdom and
goodness of God exhibiting to the world the
undeniable testimonies of the truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as often as the sincere professour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are brought to the test by afflictions from
the hand of God, or persecutions from the
hands of men. Loe <hi>here is the faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of their Saints:</hi> here is the courage, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and self-denyal shining as gold in the
fire: they have the real proofs of it before
their eyes: instead of casting them into hell,
and convincing them by eternal fire, he is
pleased to cast his own people into the fire
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:109043:84"/>
of affliction, that they who scoff at them may
be convinced at an easier and cheaper rate.
It is no new thing to see the enemies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionbrought
over to embrace it, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
and faithfulness of the Saints in their
tryals &amp; sufferings for it. God grant that the
Atheism of this present generation do not
occasion a more fiery tryal to the people of
God in it, than they have yet suffered.</p>

faithfulness of God, which stands engaged
to make good every line, word and syllable

God is faithful; who will not suffer you to be

the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and

life:</hi> and once more, Heb. 3. 15. <hi>We
are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of our confidence, stedfast unto the end.</hi>
So that if you should endure some few
slighter troubles, and faint at last; give out
when a closer tryal befals you; all your
labours and sufferings are in vain. Sincerity
and final perseverance are the conditions of
all special promises.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Every mans graces and duties
must be tryed and weighed by God in the
great day; and if they cannot endure these
lesser tryals, to which God exposed them
now, how will they endure that severe and
exact tryal to which he will bring them then?
No man can search his own heart with that
exactness in this world, as God will search i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>I may say in this case to you as the Lord
spake to <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> cl. ap. 12. 5. <hi>If thou hast
run with the footmen, and they have wearied
thee; then how canst thou contend with horses?
and if in the land of peace wherein thou trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst,
they have wearited thee; then how wilt tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
do in the swelling of Iordan?</hi> This was spoken
to encourage the <hi>Prophet</hi> to constancy in
his work; and as if the Lord had said, O <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi>
do the strivings of the men of <hi>Anat hoth</hi>
thine own Town, dishearten thee? pluck
up thy spirits and faint not; there are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Tryals than these that thou must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:109043:88"/>
at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> these are no more to what
is coming, than the running with footmen,
is to contending with horses: or the passing
a small Rivulet, to the swellings of <hi>Iordan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To allude to this, If our graces and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
cannot bear these lighter tryals, if a little
lift of prosperity, or lighter stroke of adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
discover so much falseness, rottenness,
pride, and selfishness in the heart: If we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
resist the motions of corruptions, but
yield our selves to obey sin in the lusts of it:
If we can neither keep our hearts with God
in duties, nor mourn for our wanderings
from him: If a few scoffs from wicked
tongues, or tryals of persecution from the
hands of men will cause us to faint in the
way, and turn back from following the Lord;
what shall we do when he comes whose fan
is in his hand, and who will throughly purge
his floor, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 12. who will try every
mans work as by fire, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13. search the
secrets of all hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. weigh every
man to his ounces and drachms? Surely
we can take little comfort in that which is
so unable to bear the severe tryals of that
day, that it cannot stand before the slighter
Tryals of this day.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> True grace is willing to be
tryed, and nothing is more desirable to an
upright soul than to know his own conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If therefore we shun the tryal, and are
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:109043:89"/>
loth to search our selves, or be searched by
the Lord, our condition is suspicious, and we
can take little comfort in it. It was <hi>Davids</hi>
earnest desire, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 23. that God would
throughly search his heart and reins, and see
if there were any way of wickedness in
him: false grace is shy of Gods eye; it
cares not to be examined; but this is the
delight of sincere ones: <hi>every one that doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
hateth the light, lest his deeds should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved;
but he that doth truth cometh to the
light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that
they are wrought in God,</hi> John 3. 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>The reason is plain why Hypocrisie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure to come to the. Touchstone
and test, for Hypocrites <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

consciousness of their own guilt &amp; unsound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
know that by this means their vain

all their reputation for Religion blasted:
but O if men dare not stand before the word,
as it is now opened and applyed by Minist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
how will they stand when it shall be

Jesus Christ?</p>

very worst of thy self; and when thou hast
made the deepest search thou canst, thou wilt
still fear thou hast not been severe enough,
and impa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap> enough to thy self: nothing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:109043:89"/>
will give thee more content than when thou
feelest the word dividing thy soul and spirit,
thy joynts and marrow: nothing so much
comforts thee under, or after an affliction,
as the discovery it hath made of thy heart,
thou wilt seem to feel with what affections
those words came from the Prophets lips,
Jer. 12. 3. <hi>But thou O Lord knowest me, thou
hast seen me, and tryed my heart towards thee.</hi>
O what a freshing sweetness will stream
through thy heart; and all the powers of
thy soul, when thou canst make the like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to God with like sincerity! And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
without such a disposition of spirit
towards the tryal of our graces, we can have
little evidence of the truth of them.</p>

will find me out. Ah there is no darkness
nor shadow of death that can conceal the

Oftentimes God discovers him by the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als

                     </gap>
be a day when God will strip him naked
before the great assembly of Angels and men,
and all shall point at him and say,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Loe this is the man that made not God his hope</hi>
this is he that wore a garment of profession
to deceive, but God hath now stript him
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:109043:90"/>
out of it, and all men see what he is: for,
<hi>there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed,
and hid that shall not be known:</hi> Matth. 10.
26. and the <hi>Apostle</hi> assures us, 1. Tim. 5.
24, 25. <hi>that they that are otherwise cannot be hid:</hi>
if mens works be not good, it's impossible
they should be hid long: a gilded piece of
brass may pass from hand to hand a little
while; but the touchstone will discover
the base metal: if that do not, the fire
will.</p>
                  <p>O sinners, away with your Hypocrisie, be
honest, sincere, plain, and hearty in Religion;
if not, confusion of face shall be your recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
from the Lord, that is what you shall
get by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Infer.</hi> 2. Secondly, Are there such tryals ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and permitted by the Lord for the
discovery of his peoples sincerity in this
world, <hi>then let none of Gods people expect a quiet
station in this world:</hi> certainly you shall meet
with no rest here: you must out of one
fire into another, and it is a merciful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension
of the Lord to poor creatures,
thus to concern himself for their safety and
benefit: <hi>what is man that thou shouldest mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
him? and that thou shouldst set thine heart
upon him? that thou shouldst visit him every
morning, and try him every moment?</hi> Job 7.
17, 18.</p>
                  <p>O 'tis a great deal of honour put upon a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:109043:91"/>
poor worm, when God will every moment
try him and visit him: it argues the great
esteem the Goldsmith hath of his gold, when
he will sit by the Furnace himself, and order
the fire with his own hand: when he pries
so often, and so curiously into the fining pot,
to see that none of his precious metal upon
which he sets his heart be lost.</p>
                  <p>Think it not then a debasing to you to be
so often exposed to tryals: if God did not
value you highly, he would not try you so
frequently: what would become of you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if
your condition here should be more settled
and quiet than now it is? I believe you find
dross enough in your hearts after all the
fires into which God hath cast you: surely
there is filth enough in the best of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to take all this: it may be a great deal
more trouble than they have yet met with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
we fancy it a brave life to live at ease, and
if we meet with long respites and intervals
of tryal than usual, we are apt to say, we
shall never be moved, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi>
30. 6. or we shall dye in our nest as it is,
<hi>Iob</hi> 29. 18. our hard and difficult days are
over, but woe to us if God should give us the
desire of our hearts in this: see what the
temper of those mens spirits is, that meet with
no changes, Psal. 55. 19. <hi>Because they have
no changes, therefore they have not God:</hi> O it's
better to be preserved sweet in <hi>brine,</hi> than to

                     <hi>Infer. 3. Thirdly, Let none boast in a carna
confidence of their own strength and stability;</hi>
you are yet in a state of tryal: hitherto
God hath kept you upright in all your try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
bless God but boast not: you are but
feathers in the wind of temptation, if God
leave you to your selves. <hi>Peter</hi> told Christ (and
doubtless he spake no more than he honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meant) <hi>though all men forsake thee yet will
not I:</hi> and you know what he did when
the hour of his tryal came: <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 35.
<hi>Angels</hi> left to themselves have fallen: it's
better be a <hi>humble worm,</hi> than a <hi>proud Angel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ah how many <hi>Pendletons</hi> will this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
age shew, if once God bring us to
the fiery tryal? let him that thinks he stands
take heed lest he fall: you have not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
unto blood striving against sin: none
stand upon firmer ground, than those that
see nothing in themselves to stand upon: he
that leans upon his own arm, usually benums
it, and makes it useless.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Infer. 4. Fourthly,</hi> Doth God kindle so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fires in <hi>Sion,</hi> and set his Furnaces in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
to discover and separate the dross
from the gold, <hi>how contrary are those men to
God that allow, yea and prize the dross of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
which God hates, and stick not to make
the holy God a patronizer and countenancer of it
in the hearts and lives of men!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is amazing to read what Popish pens
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:109043:92"/>
have impudently written about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Sylvester</hi> puts the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">A sum. adv. simula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio. n. 4.</note>
whether it be a sin to
make a false shew of <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi>
and answers it thus: If it be for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, and profit of others, it is no
sin: nay, they have a reverence for hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
as an holy Art. <hi>Vincentius</hi> spends a
whole Chapter in commedation of the
hypocrisie of St. <hi>Dominick;</hi> and entitles it,
<hi>de sancta ejus hypocrisi, (i. e.)</hi> of the holy hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
of that Saint: reckoning it among
his commendations, that he had the art of
dissembling. And yet one peg higher, A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious person (saith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
that feigns himself<note place="margin">Rosellain v. Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis. n. 1.</note>
to have more holiness than
he hath, that others may be edified, sins not
but rather merits.</p>
                  <p>Blush O heavens! that ever such factors
for hell should open and vend such ware as
this in the publick market, and invite the
world to Hypocrisie, as that which makes
for the glory of God, the edification of men,
and a work meritorious in the Hypocrite
himself. This is the doctrine of devils indeed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Infer. 5. Fifthly,</hi> If it be so, that all grace
must come to the test, and be tryed as gold
in the fire, even in this world: <hi>how are all
men concerned to lay a solid foundation at first,
and throughly deliberate the terms upon which
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:109043:92"/>
they close with Christ, and engage in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of his name! Which of you</hi> saith <hi>Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to build a Tower sitteth not down first,
and counteth the cost?</hi> Luk. 14. 28. if some
men had sate down at first and pondered
the conditions and terms of Christ, they had
not sate down now discouraged and tryed
in the way. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> went to work
at another rate: he accounted all but dung
and dross for Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. and was of
the same mind, when the actual tryal came;
for then he tells us, <hi>he counted not his life dear
unto him,</hi> Acts 20. 24. And the Apostle
<hi>Peter</hi> admonishes believers <hi>not to think it
strange concerning the fiery tryal which was to
try them,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 21. <hi>q. d.</hi> let none of these
things be surprisals to you, you were told
before-hand what you must trust to: every
Christian must be a <hi>Martyr,</hi> at least in the
disposition and resolution of his heart.</p>
                  <p>O that men would ballance the advantages
and disadvantages of Religion, &amp; throughly
ponder the matter in their deepest thoughts:
to the test you must come: the rain will
fall, &amp; the storm beat upon your buildings,
look carefully therefore to the foundations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Infer. 6. Sixthly</hi> and Lastly, <hi>Learn from this
point the unavoidableness of scandals and offences
in the way of Religion;</hi> for if there be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of tryal, there is also a necessity of
scandal. <hi>It must needs be that offences
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:109043:93"/>
come,</hi> Luke 17. 1. Why must it needs be?
the reason is evident, all must come to the
tryal, and all are not able to bear it. Our
Lord tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 8, 9, 10. of a day
of great straits and perplexity coming: <hi>and
then</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall many be offended.</hi> The day
of tryal is the day of scandal: by these of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
some are put a searching themselves,
and some fall a censuring all others; but the
holy God brings about his end both wayes,
in them that are saved and in them that,
perish.</p>

                  <p>WEll then, if it be so that all must into
the furnace, let every man try his
own work, Examine your selves, professours,
search your hearts, commune with your
reins: nothing more concerns you in all the
world than this doth. O that you would be
more in your closets, and oftner upon your
knees: O that you would look into the Bible,
then into your hearts; &amp; then to God, saying
with <hi>David, search me O God and know my
heart; prove me, and try my reins; and see if
there be any way of iniquity in me:</hi> never did
Religion thrive in the world since mens
heads have been so over-heated with Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Controversies, and their hearts so
sensibly cooled in their closet work. I
have elsewhere more largely pressed this
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:109043:93"/>
duty upon the professours
of this generation,<note place="margin">See my <hi>Saint indeed, p.</hi> 191, 192, 193, &amp;c.</note> and
thither shall refer the
Reader for the present to see the necessity
and importance of this work.</p>
                  <p>Here I shall only urge the duty of self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryal
by some pressing Motives, and awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Considerations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive 1.</hi> And the first shall be the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
difficulty of this work: difficulty in some
cases may be a discouragement, but where
the matter is of absolute necessity as it is
here; nothing provokes more to diligence;
<hi>strive</hi> (saith our Lord) <hi>to enter in at the strait
gate, for many will seek to enter in and shall not
be able,</hi> Luke 13. 24. A double difficulty is
found attending this work of self-tryal.
Difficulty in bringing the heart to it, and
difficulty in the right and successful manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it: who find it not hard to perswade
his heart to such work as this? nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
it, flesh and blood relish it not: it's
one of the great severities in Religion: 'tis
no easie thing to bring a man and his own
heart together.</p>
                  <p>It is in this case as in the study of <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy,</hi>
we are more inquisitive to know, and
delighted when we discover the rarities of
forraign Countreys, and strange things in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he remote parts of the world; than those
of our own native Countrey. I fear there
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:109043:94"/>
be many professours of Religion that can
spend day after day in hearing, &amp; love to be
disputing fruitless controversies, that never
spent one day in searching what influence all
those Sermons they have heard, have had
upon their hearts, or in rightly stating &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
that great Controversie, in whose
right and possession their souls are, &amp; which
way they shall go assoon as death hath divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them from those mortal bodyes; yea, I
doubt many sinful hours are spent in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into, reporting and censuring the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of others, and not one hour faithfully
imployed in judging their own hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord: O men had rather be about
any other work than this: there's no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in it to the flesh.</p>
                  <p>And yet how difficult soever it be to
bring our hearts to the work, it's certainly
much more difficult to manage it success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and bring the great question of our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
to a clear result and issue. O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
upright hearts have sate close to this
work many a year, and lifted up many a
cry to heaven, and shed many a secret and
undissembled tear about it; and yet still
are in the dark, and their minds greatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext,
and filled with fear about it: what
would they not do, what would they not
suffer? what pleasant enjoyment would they
not gladly part with to arrive at the desire of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:109043:94"/>
their souls, the full assurance of their sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!
It was the saying of a pious woman, I
have born (said she) seven Children, &amp; they
have cost me as dear as ever Children did
cost a Mother; yet would I be content to
endure all that sorrow over again, to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of the love of God to my soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive 2. Secondly,</hi> And as the work is full
of difficulty, so the discovery of your since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
will be full of sweetness, and joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable:
it will never repent you that you
have prayed and mourned, that you have
trembled and feared, that you have searched
and tryed: nay, it will never repent you that
God hath tryed you by thousands of sharp
afflictions and deep sufferings; if after all,
your sincerity may be fully clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed up to the
satisfaction of your souls; for in the same
day your sincerity shall be cleared, your title
to Christ will be made as clear to your souls
as your sincerity is: you may then go to the
promises boldly, and take your own Christ
into the arms of your faith, and say, <hi>my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
is mine, and I am his:</hi> yea, you may
be confident it shall be well with you in the
Judgment of the great day, for <hi>God will not
cast away the upright man,</hi> Job 8. 20. if the
word clear you now, it cannot condemn
you then.</p>
                  <p>O what an ease is it to the soul when the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ears and doubts that hanged about it are
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:109043:95"/>
gone! when a man sees what he is, &amp; what
he hath in Christ and the promises; and
what he hath to do; even to spend the time
betwixt this and Heaven in admiring the
grace of God that hath delivered him from
the ruining mistakes and miscarriages by
which so great a part of the professing world
perish to all eternity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive 3. Thirdly,</hi> The deep concernment
of your souls in the matter to be tryed,
should awaken you to the utmost diligence
about it. The tryals of men for their life, at
humane bars, is but a trifle to this: 'tis your
eternal happiness that stands or falls with
your sincerity.</p>
                  <p>It's said in the tryal of opinions, that if a
man superstruct hay or stubble upon the
foundation, he shall suffer loss, yet he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
may be saved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 12. but if Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
be in the foundation, there is no such
relief, there is no possibility of salvation in
that case.</p>
                  <p>Ah Reader, thou must be cast for ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the integrity or hypocrisie of thy
heart with God. Summon in then all the
powers of thy soul, bring thy thoughts as
close as it is possible to bring them to this
matter: if there be any subject of conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
able to drink up the spirits of a man,
here it is: never was time put to an higher
improvement, never were thoughts spent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:109043:95"/>
a more important business than this is:
happy is the man that rescues the years,
months, dayes, yea, the very moments of his
life from other imployments, to consecrate
them unto this solemn, awful, and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
business.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive 4. Fourthly,</hi> How evidential will it
be of your sincerity, when you are willing
to come to the tryal of your own hearts!</p>
                  <p>Suppose your doubts and fears should in
some degree remain with you, yet in this you
may take some comfort, that if Hypocrisie
be in your heart, it is not there by consent:
you are not loth to rich and come to the
tryal, because like <hi>Rachel</hi> you sit upon your
<hi>Idols:</hi> certainly it is a good sign thy heart
is right, when it is filled with so much fear
lest it should be false: you know all the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
said, Master, Is it I: before <hi>Iudas</hi> who
was the <hi>Traytor</hi> spake a word. <hi>Last of all</hi>
(saith the text) <hi>Iudas said is it I?</hi> our wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
to be tryed, is a good sign that the
desire of our souls is to be right with God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive 5. Fifthly,</hi> Conclude it to be your
great advantage to be throughly tryed, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you befound to be in the tryal: if you
be found sincere, you are richly rewarded
for all your pains and labour: never did that
man repent of digging and toyling, that after
all hit upon the rich vein that he digged
for: what is a vein of gold to a vein of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:109043:96"/>
If upon search you find the contrary, a
false Hypocritical unsound heart, yet in that
very sad discovery you meet with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
advantage that ever you had in your
lives for salvation. This discovery is your
great advantage: for now your vain confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
being over-turned, and your unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hopes destroyed; you lye open to the
stroke of a deep and effectual conviction o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
your sin and misery, which is the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
and surely till you come to that, to give up
your false hopes, and quit your vain preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
there is no hope of you. Christ told
the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> Matth 21. 31. <hi>Publicans</hi> and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots

yet they stood in a fairer way for heaven
than the Hypocritical <hi>Pharisees,</hi> because con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction

of duty and strictness to ward off the word,
that the self-couzening Pharisees had.</p>
                  <p>I may say of your vain and groundless
hopes, as Christ in another sense said to the

and richer furniture of his Chamber; I
mean that a fuller and higher condition in
