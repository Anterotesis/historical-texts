         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Reader (for
to ſuch I would
only make this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs)
thou wilt find in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
a rare Example of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
and Ingenuity, which
I wiſh it may affect thee, as it
hath done me at ſeveral times;
for I muſt confeſs, that by the
zeal and ingenuity of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte
in the profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
I have been oft-times
awakened to many affections and
<pb facs="tcp:115965:3"/>
paroxyſms of love towards Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, and been reproved
and aſhamed within my ſelf, that
he ſhould in his first beginning
of acquaintance with the Lord
Jeſus, outſtrip me in many things,
who have had ſo long acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with him, and manifold
experiences of his goodneſs and
providences towards me: But
as this on the one hand hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
me of my failing; ſo on
the other hand it hath moved me
to a loving admiration and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the free grace and work
of the Spirit of God, who blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
where he liſteth, and <hi>ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
mercy on whom he will
have mercy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 15.</note> and <hi>hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
on whom he will
<pb facs="tcp:115965:3"/>
have compaſſion.</hi> For here
we have a clear example of this
way of Gods dealing, in cauſing
one who lived in the greatneſs
and ſplendor of the world, to
renounce all for the love of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, to come amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to live unto him in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his will; and being
come amongſt thoſe firſt, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of Chriſtianity
were found by him to be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
although they uſed all ways
of induſtry and allurements to
invite him to live amongſt them,
yet he rather choſe to forſake all
the enjoyments which he might
have had amongſt them, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Society of poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
where he could have no
<pb facs="tcp:115965:4"/>
hopes of preferment, than to be
deprived of the meanes of being
perfectly joyned unto the Lord,
by ſaving knowledge, and the
converſation of thoſe that are
truly Godly: wherein we may
obſerve another act of ſpecial
grace, that he was taught by the
Spirit to diſcern the falſhood of
the by way, before he was fully
inſtructed in the Truth; and
now ſince he is come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Truth, I find his
great grievance and trouble
to be this, that he can meet with
very few who are ſincere in their
walking anſwerable to the Rule;
for of this he doth with much
paſſion ſometimes complain, that
it is a wonder to him, and a
<pb facs="tcp:115965:4"/>
cauſe of much affliction, that
ſuch as have the knowledge of
the great love of Jeſus Chriſt
towards their ſoules, and have
received from him ſo rich pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and ſo perfect a Law,
ſhould have no more reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him and his wayes; ſo that
oft-times when he hath fallen
upon theſe complaints, with
ſome paſſionate expreſſions, as
if his heart were ready to break,
he hath brought into my mind,
with more life than ever I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
could repreſent unto my
ſelf the paſſions which the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
in the 119. Pſalm ſaith he
was in by reaſon of the wicked
who tranſgreſſed the Law of
God; As when he ſaith, <hi>v. 53.
<pb facs="tcp:115965:5"/>
ror hath taken hold upon
me, becauſe of the wicked
that forſake thy Law.</hi> And
again, <hi>v. 158. I beheld the
tranſgreſſors, and was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
becauſe they kept not
thy word.</hi> I ſay that I never
underſtood the nature of this
grief and horror ſo lively with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
my ſelf, as I have perceived it
in him; by which evidence of
grace in him, I confeſs, to the
glory of God, that I have been
much edified, and many times
have had cauſe to condemn mine
own ſoul, for the ſluggiſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
under which I am found,
when I have perceived ſo much
life, and vigorous zeal and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
in a new Convert; who
<pb facs="tcp:115965:5"/>
hath quit all, and doth count e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing but dung to win
Chriſt, and to find the life of his
Holineſs amongſt Chriſtians:
For the truth is, that in all his
Converſe with others, this is his
buſineſs, to diſcern who hath
this life of love to Chriſt; who
it is that walks without worldly
intereſts, and is unbyaſſed in the
profeſſion: And becauſe he
doth meet with ſo few in whom
he can perceive the ſincerity
and ingenuity of the Spirit of
Chriſt, therefore he is oft-times
troubled and offended; and
I am made partaker of his grief,
and made more ſenſible of it than
at any time heretofore, when I
have had no ſuch object to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb facs="tcp:115965:6"/>
withall; but chiefly I find
him in the extremit of paſſion
with anger and grief, when he
perceives (and truly he is very
diſcerning) that under any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Religion or of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
men drive on ſome ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt;
when he perceives this, he
knows not almoſt with what words
of indignation to deteſt that hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie:
So that to conclude, I muſt
truly ſay, to the glory of God, that
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is upon my heart, that whiles
I have been imployed to inſtruct
and comfort him, I have profited
more by his converſation, than
by any that I have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
withall in <hi>England;</hi>
and if this man ſhould not prove
ſincere and upright in the way
<pb facs="tcp:115965:6"/>
of Godlineſs, I ſhall confeſs that
I know no evidence to diſcern
the uprightneſs of any man
henceforth in this world.</p>
            <p>And if thou that art ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and ſincere in thy love to
Chriſt, wilt converſe with him,
I make no doubt but thou wilt
find this to be a Truth, which
in ſimplicity of heart, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
thee to look to thy wayes, as
in the preſence of God, is freely

good to add this to the

him what he thought of the <hi>Turkiſh Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi>

Sir (ſayes he) why ſhould we go about

ſecretly (as I took it) intimating, that
we rather depart from God, than God
from us. I underſtanding that he was
much offended at the wicked lives of
Chriſtians, did much endeavour to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
him againſt that poyſon, telling
him, that the ſmall number of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
was ſo far from giving juſt cauſe
of offence, that it did eſtabliſh the truth
of the Goſpel, ſince Chriſt plainly tells
us, that there are few that ſhall be ſaved;
and that many are called, and few are
choſen; but that withall I doubted not
but hereafter he ſhould meet with, and
be acquainted with abundance who truly
feared God, and lived ſuitable to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Chriſt, whoſe acquaintance
would as much rejoyce him, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did ſcandalize him. His Anſwer
was with much gravity thus. Sir, I judge
not of the Word of God by men, but of
men by the Word of God. And that
there was but one <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom;</hi> but
that it was true that he was much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and it yet troubled him to ſee the
wicked lives of thoſe that call themſelves
Chriſtians. I thought to try him with
<pb facs="tcp:115965:8"/>
ſomething a more intricate queſtion. I
asked him how it came to paſs, that he
reading of ſuch high points, as of the
Trinity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Bible, he ſhould not
rather judge that Book not to be Gods
Word, that ſpake of things ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
reaſon, rather than to judge theſe
things to be true, becauſe he found them
written in the Bible? To this purpoſe he
anſwered, That he was much ſatisfied of
the Truth of Chriſtian Religion before
he came out of his own Country; and
finding that all Chriſtians did agree that
their Religion was ſet down in that
Book, he had a reverend eſteem of it,
and ſaid, the ſpiritual love of God in the
heart, prepares it to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of ſpiritual truths. I asking him
what reaſons moved him to embrace
Chriſtianity? he uſed this expreſſion:
As a man at a feaſt takes one bit here,
and another there, till at laſt he is
ſo ſatisfied that he can eat no more;
So there were ſeveral reaſons that
from time to time affected him, that
at laſt he could ſtand out no longer. He
told me moreover, that he went ſeveral
times on Pilgrimage to <hi>Mahomets</hi>
Tomb, and the laſt time was reſolved to
<pb facs="tcp:115965:8"/>
ſee what was in it. The Prieſt at firſt
was very unwilling to ſhew it, ſaying,
that there were divers there, and ſuch a
thing was not to be publickly ſeen. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which, he told him he would ſtay till
they were gone; and ſo did. Then he
being a man of power and authority, the
Prieſt durſt not deny him, but opened
the Tomb, where he ſaw nothing but a
few ſcattered black bones, which much
incenſed him againſt <hi>Mahomet;</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
(ſaith he) that had I ſpoke what I
then thought, I had not gone alive out
of that place. I having read in the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh
Hiſtory a Relation much conducing
to the advantage of Chriſtian Religion,
and knowing that it was in his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
enquired of him of the truth of
it. He told me that it was very true, and
related ſome other paſſages which are
not ſet down in the printed ſtory, which
he ſaid, with other things, did much affect
him, but that the Grand Signior char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that upon pain of death none ſhould
ſpeak of it. The Story was this.</p>
            <p>About the year 1620. upon the 10th.
of <hi>September.</hi> There came Newes to
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> of a ſtrange Apparition
or Viſion, which was ſeen at <hi>Medina
<pb facs="tcp:115965:9"/>
Talnabi</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> whereas <hi>Mahomet</hi>
their great Prophet was buried: to viſit
whoſe Tomb the Turks uſe to go in Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
but they muſt firſt go to <hi>Mecha,</hi>
which is ſome few dayes journey off, and
there they take a ticket from the Grand
Seigniors Beglerbeg, elſe they are not
allowed to go to <hi>Medina.</hi> This Viſion
continued three weeks together, which
terrified the whole Countrey, for that
no man could diſcover the truth thereof.
About the 20th. of <hi>September,</hi> there fell
ſo great a tempeſt, and ſo fearful thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
about midnight, as the Heavens
were darkened, and thoſe that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
almoſt diſtracted; but the vapours
being diſperſed, and the element clear,
the people might read in Arabian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
theſe words in the Firmament,
<hi>O why will ye believe in lyes!</hi> Between
two and three in the morning, there was
ſeen a woman in white, compaſſed about
with the Sun, having a cheerful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and holding in her hand a Book:
coming from the North-weſt, oppoſite
againſt her were armies of <hi>Turks, Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Arabians,</hi> and other <hi>Mahometans,</hi>
ranged in order of battel, and ready to
charge her; but ſhe kept her ſtanding,
<pb facs="tcp:115965:9"/>
and only opened the Book, at the ſight
whereof thoſe Armies fled: and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
all the lamps about <hi>Mahomets</hi>
Tomb went out; for as ſoon as ever the
Viſion vaniſhed (which was commonly
an hour before Sun-riſing) a murmuring
wind was heard, whereunto they impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the extinguiſhing of the lamps. The
ancient Pilgrims of <hi>Mahomets</hi> race, who
after they have viſited this place never
uſe to cut their hair, were much amazed,
for that they could not conceive the
meaning of this Viſion: only one of the
<hi>Dervices</hi> (which is a ſtrict religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
among the Turks, like unto the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins</hi>
among the Papiſts, and live in
contemplation) ſtepped up very boldly,
and made a Speech unto the company,
which incenſed them much againſt him,
ſo as this poor Prieſt for his plain dealing
loſt his life, as you ſhall hear.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The ſumme of his ſpeech was this:
That the World had never but three
true Religions, every one of which
had a Prophet; firſt God choſe the
<hi>Jewes,</hi> and did wonders for them in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and brought them forth by
their Prophet <hi>Moſes,</hi> who preſcribed
them a Law, wherein he would have
<pb facs="tcp:115965:10"/>
maintained them, if they had not been
obſtinate and rebellious, and fallen to
Idolatry: whereupon he gave them
over, and ſcattered them upon the
face of the earth. Then preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he raiſed a new Prophet, who
taught the Chriſtian Religion. This
good man the <hi>Jewes</hi> condemned and
crucified for a Seducer of the people,
not moved with the piety of his life,
his great Miracles, nor his Doctrine.
Yet after his death, the preaching of a
few fiſhermen did ſo move the hearts
of men, as the greateſt Monarchs of
the world bowed to his very Title,
and yielded to the command of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.
But it ſeems they grew as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
as the <hi>Jewes,</hi> their Church being
diſmembred with the diſtinction of the
Eaſt and Weſt, committing Idolatry
again by ſetting up of Images, with
many other idle ceremonies, beſides
the corruption of their lives, ſo as God
was weary of them too, and not only
ſent diviſions among them, but forſook
them, diſpoſſeſſing them of their chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Cities, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople?</hi>
yet God is ſtill the Governor of the
World, and provides himſelf of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:115965:10"/>
Prophet and people, raiſing our
Great <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and giving way to
our Nation, ſo as no doubt we ſhall
be happy for ever, if we can ſerve this
God aright, and take example by the
fall of others. But alas! I tremble to
ſpeak it, we have erred in every point,
and wilfully broken our firſt inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſo as God hath manifeſted his
wrath by evident ſignes and tokens,
keeping our Prophet from us, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
a time to return with all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to his people, ſo as there are now
forty yeares paſt by our account:
Wherefore this ſtrange and fearful Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is a prediction of ſome great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and alterations. For either the
opening of this Book in the womans
hand, doth foretel our falling away
from the firſt intent of our Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
theſe armed men departed as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with the guilt of their own
conſciences; or elſe it ſignifies ſome
other book wherein we have not yet
read, and againſt which no power
ſhall prevail: ſo as I fear our Religion
will be proved corrupt, and our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
an Impoſtor, and then this <hi>Chriſt</hi>
whom they talk of ſhall ſhine like the
<pb facs="tcp:115965:11"/>
Sun, and ſet up his name everlaſtingly.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Hitherto the company were ſilent; but
hearing him ſpeak ſo boldly, they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him with blaſphemy; and knowing
their Law, which makes all blaſphemy
capital, they preſently condemned him
and having the Beglerbegs conſent and
warrant, they put him to death.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved his carriage to be very
grave and ſerious; he ſpeaks of Chriſt
with much affection and reverence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
calling him the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.
Both his pronuciation and his geſtures
ſhew his high eſteem of Chriſt. When
I was with him he was very temperate
in his dyet; his civilities ſuch as ſhew
him to be a man of no ordinary breeding
and education. This brings to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
a ſtory he told me of certain
Quakers, who came to him with their
hands in their pockets, and uſing thoſe
rude carriages which they are known to
uſe to all, though of never ſo great quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
withal telling him that we ſhould not
uſe any titles of honor or civilities to any.
He told me he was much offended at their
demeanour, and ſaid unto them, that for
his part he thought that Worſhip was
due to God, and Courteſie to man. I
<pb facs="tcp:115965:11"/>
bleſs God for many ſpiritual advantages
that I have gained by thoſe things I have
heard of him and from him.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, this providence is not to be
gazed on, but to be improved: we muſt
not be like <hi>Athenians,</hi> that love novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
though the thing be never ſo ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
when it ceaſes to be novell'd, it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to affect them; and if it be new, though
they account him a meer babler that tells
it, they long to hear it. I fear Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuffers upon this account: And
whereas the longer we are acquainted
with the truths of God, the more we
ſhould admire and love them; yet it is
too evident, that novelty is as prevalent
in matters of Religion, as of the things
of this world. The Uſes that we are
to make of this Narrative, I conceive
to be theſe. Firſt, that if we account it
(as we may juſtly do) ſo great a mercy,
that God hath ſnatcht this Convert as a
firebrand out of the fire, ought not we
to eſteem the mercy leſs that we have
enjoyed it ſo long? In ſome ſenſe we
may ſay, that with a great ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
he hath purchac'd this freedom; for
he hath been fain to leave a great eſtate
and his Countrey: But we are born free;
<pb facs="tcp:115965:12"/>
had we been born where the name of
Chriſt had not been ſpoke of, or blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
we could not without a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
providence have been ſav'd. Now
without a ſtupendious wickedneſs, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy
and infidelty, we cannot be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
bleſſed be God for our birth-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges;
and the Lord grant that we may
not ſo abuſe them, that we ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to meet them at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I think further, that if it be ſuch
a juſt cauſe of rejoycing, that one Turk
is Baptized and become a Chriſtian, how
ſhould we pray and endeavour as much
as in us lies, that not only they, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
poor Heathen Nations may be
brought in? If there were as great care
and wiſedom uſed for the ſpreading of
the Goſpel, as there is for the vending
of our Staple-commodities in other
Countreys, how wonderful would God
bleſs our endeavours? But in ſtead of
propagating the Goſpel abroad, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
and deſtroy it at home. I fear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Merchants and Travellers leave the
ſcandal that their ſins cauſe behind
them, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>ing the infection and
vices of Forein Nations home with
them. Divers Travellers go abroad
<pb facs="tcp:115965:12"/>
with a little Religion, and return with
none.</p>
            <p>The next Uſe that I could wiſh were
made, ſhould be, that all Chriſtians
might ſo live, that all ſhould have cauſe
to ſay as <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> did of <hi>Origen,</hi>
when perceiving ſome to wonder at the
learning of <hi>Origen,</hi> whereby they were
induced to embrace the Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion:
Truly (ſaith he) the humility and
charity of Chriſtian people, which I have
heard of, and do daily behold, doth much
more perſwade me to believe that Chriſt
is God, than all <hi>Origens</hi> Arguments.
Surely if Chriſtians lived like Chriſtians,
it were enough to make Heathens Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
but generally the lives of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
are ſuch, that it is enough to make
any but true Chriſtians to ſay, <hi>ſit anima
mea cum Philoſophis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will give you a ſhort Narrative of
ſome things that I have heard from this
Noble Convert and others, of the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and fidelity of Turks. He told me
that once a year all the great men of
<hi>Turky,</hi> Baſhaws and others, had their
whole eſtates valued and caſt up by their
Stewards, and they give the tenth part
yearly to charitable uſes. I could wiſh
<pb facs="tcp:115965:13"/>
that this example were followed, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by perſons of great eſtates: Thoſe that
have many thouſands a year, that might
better ſpare the third part of their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
than one of a ſmall eſtate can the
twentieth part of his; yet how do they
look upon it as a work of ſupererogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if they give but four or five times a
year but twenty pound at a time? nay I
wiſh there were not ſome who have vaſt
eſtates, and not a child to leave it to,
and yet never make an end of encreaſing.
The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If any man be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,</hi>
as well as <hi>if any man be a drunkard,
with ſuch a man do not eat.</hi> For my part,
if after admonition ſuch a one as I have
ſpoke of did not reform, I ſhould vote
him to be covetous, and upon that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
him. There is a ſtory alſo
that I think worth relating, becauſe of
the good uſe that may be made of it.
Two Turks there were that had made a
Chriſtian drunk, and then put a turban
on his head, and next day accus'd him
to the Muſty that he had promiſed to be,
and had took upon him the habit of a
Turk, and that therefore he ought to be
circumciſed; and if he turned Chriſtian,
to be burnt. Some of this Chriſtians
<pb facs="tcp:115965:13"/>
friends deſir'd this Noble Turk, who was
in great Authority, to deliver him out of
that ſnare. He went to the Mufty, and
took no notice of the buſineſs until the
Mufty ſpoke to him of it; which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
did, for the buſineſs was then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; He deſired to have the hearing
of it. He enquired of the firſt witneſſe
whether he drunk wine with this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian?
he could not deny it; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
commanded that he ſhould
receive ſo many baſtinadoes for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing
the law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and
after execution done, they brought him
again; he then commanded him to
repeat the commandemants of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
which he not being able to do, he
rejected him, as not being a competent
witneſs: The other witneſs being ſearcht,
was found not to be a Turk, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to be circumciſed, ſince he profeſt
himſelf to be a Turk; and ſo the witneſſes
being taken off, delivered the Chriſtian.
That uſe that I could wiſh were made of
this ſtory, I could wiſh were this, That we
might at leaſt give as much honour to
Chriſt, as Turks do to <hi>Mahomet;</hi> viz.
That as no one amongſt them is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
witneſs except he can repeat the
<pb facs="tcp:115965:14"/>
commandements of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> ſo none
amongſt us might be received as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
except they could ſay the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.
As for their juſtice and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
I have heard and read much. It
is related of one of our Merchants, who
had ſold a great quantity of cloth to one
of the Turks, who, the next year, when
the Merchant came again, told him, that
he was miſtaken in the meaſure of his
cloth, and that there was ſo much over
meaſure as came to fifteen pound more,
and that he had put it in a bag that it
might be ready for him againſt he came.
The Merchant told him, that he had got
enough by him, and ſaid, <hi>much good may
it do you.</hi> The Turk anſwered and ſaid,
Sir, take it, or elſe I will otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of it, for it is none of mine. It is
related alſo, that a Merchant of ours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to one of their ſhops, the Turk told
him that he had ſold enough that day,
ſaying, I pray Sir go to ſuch a neighbour
of mine, you ſhal have as good there, and
and as cheap as I have, and he hath
had little cuſtome to day. If theſe ſtories
be true, as I judge them to be, have we
not all much reaſon to wiſh that moſt of
us might be converted to be Turks, as to
<pb facs="tcp:115965:14"/>
our converſation, that we might be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Chriſtians? If theſe ſtories be falſe,
yet ſince we and our conſciences judge
them to be good, do not we condemn
our ſelves, if we do not follow their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples?
For as the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>Thou
art inexcuſable O man, whoſoever thou
art that judgeſt; for wherein thou judgeſt
another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf; thou
that judgeſt, doſt the ſame thing.</hi> So I
may ſay, thou art inexcuſable O man,
whoſoever thou art, that commendeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and doſt not the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Another thing that I conceive remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable,
and conſiderable, and of great uſe
unto us, is to conſider, how that thoſe
that are converted at mans eſtate to
Chriſtian Religion, with what reliſh and
high admirings they read the Scripture.
Doubtleſs they underſtand divers Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
much otherwiſe and better than we
do, having not been corrupted with thoſe
Gloſſes and Interpretations that too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
are given of them, eſpecially in
the matter of riches; it may be ſaid of
the Scripture, as the Scripture ſaith of
man, God made man upright, but he hath
found out many inventions; ſo it may
be ſaid that God made the Scripture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
<pb facs="tcp:115965:15"/>
right, but men have found out many
Expoſitions; and being unwilling to
bring their lives to the Scriptures, have
thereby brought the Scriptures to their
lives. Me thinks ſuch a Convert, one
that is a prudent, and by his converſion
made a pious man, and never heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing of the Goſpel before, is like
<hi>Adam</hi> when he was created and brought
into Paradiſe, he being of ſuch wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
acuteneſs of ſenſe and underſtanding,
Seeing the glorious Sun, and the rich
ſpacious heavens, and the earth in all
her bravery, hearing the melody of
the birds, and never ſeeing any ſuch
thing before, and being able to diſcern
the wiſedom of God in their frame and
creation, as well as the goodneſs of God
in their uſe, one would think it a
wonder how it were poſſible for him
to be tempted, or at leaſt ſo ſoon; but
for us, we being born infants, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
uſed to theſe ſights by degrees, take
little notice, either of the wiſedom or
goodneſs of God in the works of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
which loſe the ſtrangeneſs and
novelty, before we come to know them.
So it is alſo with us in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
we ate taught in our infancy the
<pb facs="tcp:115965:15"/>
Doctrine of the Goſpel, and it is well
we are; but generally Parents teach
their children ſo careleſly, irreverently,
overly, and formally, that the Doctrine
of Chriſtianity takes little or no impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on them, and they are brought up in a
formality of Religion, and form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
which brings them generally to
a ſenſleſneſs in the matters of God, ſo
that by that time they be come to years
of underſtanding, they deal with Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
as we do with the Sun, make uſe
of its light to direct us in our worldly
buſineſs, but ſeldom admire the glory of
it. So people uſe the profeſſion of their
Religion to carry on their deſigns, but
ſeldom are affected with the beauty of
it. It is pity we ſhould love God leſs,
becauſe we have loved him ſo long, and
becauſe he hath been ſo long mercifull
unto us; nay doubtleſs true love doth
not grow weaker by age. One thing
more I ſhall adviſe, and conclude: <hi>viz.</hi>
That as the Angels in Heaven rejoyce
at ſuch a ones Converſion, ſo ſhould
we, and do ſomething more than the
Angels do, that is, we ſhould pray for
him, that God, whom we hope hath
begun a good work in this Convert,
<pb facs="tcp:115965:16"/>
would perfect and finiſh it, and would
preſerve and keep him by his mighty
power through faith to ſalvation, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115965:17"/>
by ſome ſpecial Providences
(whereof a particular account
may be given hereafter) he was
moved to believe that in very
deed Jeſus Chriſt whom the <hi>Jewes</hi>
put to death at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was the
Son of God, and now alive in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
having all power in heaven
and earth: Whereupon he took
a ſecret reſolution within himſelf
to retire from among the <hi>Turks</hi> his
Countreymen, and live among
Chiſtians, to learn the Lawes of
Jeſus Chriſt, and make profeſſion
of his name, for the ſaving of his
ſoul, being fully convinced, that
all the enjoyments and pleaſures
of this world (whereof he had no
want) could not make a man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in this life, nor deliver him
from death, nor bring him to the
aſſurance of obtaining glory in
the world to come; but that the
owning of the name of Jeſus
Chriſt by Faith and Obedience,
would procure all this, And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115965:18"/>
that he was convinced of theſe
Truths, and fully reſolved to
come among Chriſtians, he was
two whole years before he could
contrive the way how to depart
from his own Kindred and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with ſafety; becauſe the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for a <hi>Turk</hi> to turn Chriſtian,
or to renounce the Mahometan
Religion, is by their Law to be
burnt alive: Therefore being
wary, leſt he ſhould be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and having attempted ſome
wayes to tranſport himſelf which
proved ineffectual; at laſt, by the
addreſs of ſome whom God ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up to be ſerviceable unto him,
he tranſported himſelf from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where other
providence did guide him to find
a way of being tranſported unto
<hi>Ligorn.</hi> Having paſt the <hi>Quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana,</hi>
he was honourably received
by one of the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> his
Couſins, and there they would
have Baptized him; but becauſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115965:18"/>
he was recommended to the Arch-Biſhop
of <hi>Paris,</hi> and was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
thither by ſome who went
from <hi>Smyrna</hi> with him, he would
not receive their favour. So
from <hi>Ligorn</hi> he went to <hi>Marſelles,</hi>
and from <hi>Marſelles</hi> he was condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to <hi>Paris.</hi> At <hi>Paris</hi> he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with reſpect, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be a Perſon of quality,
and lodged in St. <hi>Lazaro,</hi> a place
appointed for the inſtructing and
entertaining of Proſelytes, for
which charitable uſe it is largely
endowed. There the Prieſts who
were appointad to inſtruct him,
and fit him to be Baptized accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Profeſſion, and he
could not agree, concerning ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things which they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
him to believe and practice
as Eſſentials to their Religion
<hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt was in the Hoſtie;
that the <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> had Divine
vertue; that the Crucifix is to be
worſhipped; that the Pope is a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115965:19"/>
Saint, and Chriſts Vicar; that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
and Saints are to be reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the worſhip of God. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all which, and ſome other
points, he did ſo argue with them,
that they found no way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him, but were forced to let
him alone: And he was much
troubled to find himſelf yoked
with men of ſuch a belief; ſo that
he could have found in his heart
to have returned again to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
if the way had been open
for him.</p>
            <p>Whiles he was in this perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Providence did direct two <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians</hi>
who were become Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
to ſee him: By their means
he did get notice that there were
beſides the Papiſts amongſt whom
he was, other Chriſtians in <hi>Paris,</hi>
whoſe faith and worſhip was free
from Superſtition; whereupon he
reſolved to be brought unto the
Proteſtants of <hi>Paris,</hi> and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a way with theſe <hi>Arabians</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115965:19"/>
how he might come to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with them, which took
effect: For under a pretence of
walking abroad to take the air,
he ſhifted himſelf of the company
which attended him from St. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaro,</hi>
and went with the <hi>Arabians</hi>
to a Proteſtant houſe, and became
acquainted with the Miniſters of
<hi>Paris,</hi> who took ſpecial care of him
for the ſpace of 43. days; in which
time they did inſtruct him care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
in the Truth, which he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
did imbrace. But great ſearch
being made for him to find him
out, and they not being able to
protect him from the power of
thoſe that would have taken him
out of their hands, they conſulted
with the chief of their Friends
what to do with him, that he
might be in ſafety: The Reſult of
which Conſultation was, that he
ſhould be ſent away into <hi>England,</hi>
where he arrived in <hi>March</hi> laſt;
and being recommended to his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115965:20"/>
Highneſs of bleſſed memory, he
was received with much kindneſs
by him, and after ſome time a
livelyhood was appointed unto
him; and about the ſame time
Mr. Secretary <hi>Thurloe</hi> did recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him to the care of Mr. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
that he ſhould conſider him,
and adviſe what ſhould be done
with him further.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Durie</hi> having converſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
with him, and finding
him a man of parts, and for the
main, well principled in point of
knowledge, both in the grounds
of Faith, and in the practice of
Chriſtianity, he made enquiry of
his life and converſation amongſt
all thoſe with whom he had
dwelt, and with whom he had
been acquainted ſince he was
come into <hi>England;</hi> and finding
that they all gave him a very good
teſtimony, he made a Report to
Mr. Secretary; whereof the chief
Subſtance was as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:115965:20"/>
By all that I have been able to
obſerve in this Turkiſh Chaous,
I cannot judge otherwiſe but that
he is a ſincere Convert to the
name of Jeſus Chriſt, believing in
him for the ſalvation of his ſoul,
and poſt-poſing all other things
for the attainment thereof: For
although his notional knowledge
is weak, and doth not much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the common Articles of the
Creed (ſo far as yet I do diſcover)
yet I judge it ſaving in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I find his faith ſincere, and
his love to God in Jeſus Chriſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and well grounded.</p>
            <p>I diſcern the ſincerity of his
Faith, not only by the profeſſion
of his love to Chriſt upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that which Chriſt hath
done for us, but by the ſenſe
which he hath of Gods Truth and
Faithfulneſs in his promiſes to
thoſe that truſt in him, which by
pretty familiar compariſons he
hath expreſſed upon ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115965:21"/>
much to my comfort, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he ſheweth a generoſity of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to give up himſelf unto Chriſt
without reſerve.</p>
            <p>The ſincerity and fervency of
his love to Chriſt, I perceive by
his deſire to know his will, that
he may obey his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
for in this he hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto me earneſt and ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,
declaring that he finds
himſelf obliged in thankfulneſſe
to God for Chriſt, to become his
ſervant, and to obey him in all
conditions, becauſe (ſaith he)
God hath beſtowed upon me the
true Faith, by which I find an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
rejoycing in my ſoul to
come to God, and to call upon
him with confidence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I muſt ſerve and love him.</p>
            <p>And I judge laſtly, that both
his Faith and Love is well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
becauſe I find him really
patient, meek, and humble, with
cheerfulneſs bearing this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115965:21"/>
on whereinto God hath caſt him,
which in it ſelf outwardly is not
at all comfortable, but rather
hard; and becauſe he maketh oft
a reflexion upon the great mercy
and love of God towards poor
ſinners, of which number he doth
feelingly confeſs himſelf to be
one: And I judge that he doth
it feelingly, becauſe he ſhewes a
hatred to his former ſinful life, and
a joy to have found a way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from it.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of Grace in this <hi>Turk,</hi> who
hath ſo little Notional knowledge
(of which ſo many of us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
abound ſo much, and for
which there is ſo much ſtir and
ſtrife, and ſo many rents among
us) doth make me ſee more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
and diſtinctly than I have
formerly been able to do, how
little ſpeculative knowledge is
needful to ſave a ſoul, when the
Spirit of Grace by true Faith and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115965:22"/>
Love doth dwell in it; which doth
make me fear, that many of our
great leading and pretending pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
ſome in forms, and ſome
without forms, exalting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in their waies one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
another, will be found in the
way of true Chriſtianity far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
this Turck, when they ſhall
be tryed as he is; Surely Religion
doth not conſiſt in the things
which moſt men ſtrive about, but
in the life and power of Godlineſs
which is forgotten when men
make their profeſſion to become
a matter of Intereſt, and do not
own Chriſt ſurely for his own
ſake, as he is the Son of God and
our Saviour; which I find this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Tvrck doth in ſimplicitie, for
he is a Sober man in words and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
for ſo far as I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
with him, I have found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
indiſcreetly done or ſaid by
him, for he ſpakes ſeldome except
he be put to it, and when he ſpeaks
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115965:22"/>
of himſelf he doth it ſparingly
chiefly concerning his outward
former ſtate, and at preſent he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
nothing ſo much (if a man
may believe his expreſſions) as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſupplyed with a neceſſarie
livelyhood to apply himſelf to
the ſtudy and life of Chriſtianity,
to which effect he deſires to be
taught our Language to ſpeak,
read and write it, that he may
learn the Law of Chriſt in the
Scripture, and I believe by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Characters of his Faith and
Love to Chriſt, that this is his true
intention and deſire.</p>
            <p>Having delivered my opinion
of his ſincerity upon the ground
of mine own converſation with
him: I ſhall farther relate what I
have found concerning him upon
an inquiry from others; for being
deſirous to know how he ſpent
his time dayly, he told me that he
went abroad from morning till
evening, and that his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115965:23"/>
was with ſome Turkie Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and with ſome French
Men, and with Mr. <hi>Powel,</hi> who
liveth near the Temple. I have
ſpoken with the Governour and
Secretary of the Turkie Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
and with ſome of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
amongſt whom Mr. <hi>Mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diford</hi>
is the Chief of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and with the french Men,
with whom he hath had his dyet
ſince he came hither; they all give
him a very good report co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning
his life &amp; converſation, and make
no doubt of his ſicerity; Mr. <hi>Mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diford</hi>
in a ſpecial manner told me,
that by the circumſtances of
things which he relates concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his Father, he believes him
to be the Son of one who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Squadron of Gallies and was
killed in a fight at <hi>Negropont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then upon the whole matter,
I ſhould give my advice, touching
that which I think fit ſhould be
done with him, take it thus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:115965:23"/>
Firſt ſome competent proviſion
being made for his livelyhood,
and ſo ſetled that it may come
duyly to his hands, he might be
boarded and lodged with ſome
underſtanding honeſt Chriſtian,
who ſhould at a reaſonable rate
provide one to teach him to read,
write, and ſpeak Engliſh at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
hours of the day.</p>
            <p>Secondly he ſhould be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Mr. <hi>Calandrine</hi> the
Dutch Miniſter, who ſpeaks Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
and with the Miniſter of the
Italian Church, who ſhould with
Mr. <hi>Deſpagne</hi> and my ſelf, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to take ſome turns to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with him till we judge it
fit that he ſhould be publickly
baptized.</p>
            <p>Thirdly when he ſhall be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
inſtructed to make a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
profeſſion of his faith and
promiſe of his obedience unto
Chriſt, the time, place, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his publick Baptiſm may
be determined.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:115965:24"/>
Fourthly when afterward he
ſhall be able to ſpeak Engliſh it
may be conſidered, whether yea
or no, and what employment he
may be put to. For he profeſſes a
willingneſs to do any ſervice
which he ſhall be judged capable
to perform.</p>
            <p>This was the ſubſtance of that
report and advice which Mr. <hi>Dury</hi>
gave of him to Mr. Secretatry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the latter end of <hi>May</hi> 1658.</p>
            <p>And this advice was followed;
for being recommended to the
Miniſters forenamed, they gave
him admittance, and ſoon found
him fit to be Baptized, but the
Solemnity of his Baptiſm was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed,
partly by reaſon of his
ſickneſſe, partly by reaſon of a
journy which Mr. <hi>Durie</hi> made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Country, and partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of ſome other lets and tryals
which did befall him, till at
laſt Mr. <hi>Durie</hi> thought it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to put him upon a way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115965:24"/>
his capacity of Baptiſm,
that all who ſhould doubt of the
ſufficiencie of his knowledge in
Chriſtianity, might receive ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
thereby, and to this effect
he made a Note of certain heads
of matters, to the number of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen,
naming only the bare
Titles (as concerning God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Trinity, concerning
the Creation of the World, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Adam</hi> and his Sin, &amp;c.) and
gave them to him that his boy
ſhould read them to him in order
(for he can neither read nor write
himſelf) and that he ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
unto his Boy that which he
did know and believe concerning
each of thoſe Heads. This Note
Mr. <hi>Durie</hi> gave unto him about
nine of the Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng,
and left him to his thoughts
when he had promiſed that he
would go about it that very day;
and the ſame day about nine of
the Clock at night, his Boy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115965:25"/>
brought Mr. <hi>Durie</hi> the Confeſſion
hereafter adjoyned, pretty well
written in French; which when
Mr. <hi>Durie</hi> had read, finding it ſo
full and ſatisfactory, that he did
wonder at it, he reſolved to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
it into Engliſh, keeping as
neer as the ſenſe would bear it,
the very words which he uſed;
and having done this, he cauſed
ſome Copies to be tranſcribed in
his French, and ſome in Engliſh,
and imparted the French to ſome
of his Highneſs Councel, and the
Engliſh to the Commiſſioners
who meet at <hi>White-hall</hi> for appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Miniſters; who all hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his holy and zealous way
of converſation, judged him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fit to be Baptized without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay;
and the performance of that
duty towards him was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to Mr. <hi>Durie,</hi> who having
conſulted with Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the manner of doing it
in the place where his Cong rega<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115965:25"/>

a great Font being ſet up neer the
Pulpit, on the Lords day <hi>January</hi>
the 30<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> in the Afternoon Mr.

                           <hi>Cornelius</hi> was an Alien from the

to be Baptized. <hi>Cornelius</hi> was by

Providence directed hither
without his own contrivance, to
be received into the Church, and
owned as a member of Chriſt.
<hi>Cornelius</hi> having heard the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

<hi>Turk</hi> hath been taught, and doth
believe the Truth. <hi>Cornelius</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
believed, did receive the

according to the diſpenſation of

<hi>Can any man forbid?</hi> The Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation

why it ſhould not be conferred

the words, which anſwer the two
main Queſtions which concern
Baptiſm. 1. How Baptiſm is to be

part of the text ſpeaks of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how Baptiſm is to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred.
<hi>Can any man forbid water, that
theſe ſhould not be Baptized?</hi> The
Second ſpeaks of the perſons to
whom Baptiſm ought to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred,
<hi>viz.</hi> to ſuch <hi>who have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Holy Ghoſt as well as we.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <head>Of the firſt Queſtion.</head>
                           <p>If the Queſtion be, How Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
is be adminiſtred? The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
from the Text is, by making
uſe of water, in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghoſt, to waſh the outward
man. This is clear from the Text,
and from the Inſtitution of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
and from the Reaſon of the
uſe of water in the Inſtitution.
The Text makes the forbidding
of water, and not Baptizing to be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115965:27"/>
co-incidents or conſequents: <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
water</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that
they ſhould not be Baptized?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the Rule of Contraries it
follows, the not forbidding, but
adminiſtring water, is Baptiſm.
Hence we ſee that in the verſe
following, when it is ſaid He
commanded them to be Baptized
in the name of the Lord, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
water to be adminiſtred
unto them, that they ſhould be
waſhed according to the Lords
appointment: For ſo I takehere
the word name to be the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Lords command: So
the ſenſe is, he commanded in
the name of the Lord that they
ſhould be Baptized; or to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
by vertue of the Lords ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment:
which ſenſe, makes
the former Interrogation, <hi>Can any
man forbid?</hi> to be ſo much the
ſtronger negation, as oppoſed to
a command given by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord. Thus Water-Baptiſm
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115965:28"/>
is clear in this Text, and
undeniably the practice in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
times, as is evident alſo
by the Eunuch, and <hi>Philips</hi> bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of him, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 36, 37, 38, 39.</p>
                           <p>The Inſtitution of Baptiſm, and
Chriſts own practice, ſhewes that
he appointed water to be made
uſe of in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghoſt, <hi>Matth. 28. 19, 20. Goe</hi>
(ſaith Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>) <hi>make diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
all Nations.</hi> How are they
to be made diſciples? <hi>Baptizing
them in the name,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and Teaching
them,</hi> &amp;c. To make a diſciple, is to
enroll and admit of one to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Diſcipline, that is, to be rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
amongſt thoſe who are to be
taught; which enrolment and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
is done by the uſe of water,
&amp; the word of the inſtitution. And
it is clear, that to make a diſciple,
and to Baptize, is one thing, from
Chriſts own practice, <hi>Joh. 4. 1. Jeſus
made &amp; baptized more diſciples them
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115965:28"/>
John.</hi> Here making diſciples &amp; Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
are concomitant or co-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
things: He that is made a
diſciple, is made by being Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed;
and he that is Baptized, is <hi>eo
ipſo</hi> made a diſciple. Thus Chriſts
Inſtitution was to have a mark
put upon his diſciples, which
ſhould ſignifie and ſeal unto them
both a relation and qualification
beſtowed upon them by being his
diſciples. And from hence is to
be conſidered the Reaſon of the
Inſtitution, which hath two
grounds. Firſt Chriſt would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
and perfect that which was
Typical under the Law, pointing
at himſelf. Secondly, he would
manifeſt by the outward proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of water, that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
wrought in a believing
ſoul, and that ſtate wherein a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
is ſet by being his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                           <p>In the Law, all the Purifications,
whether they were by blood or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115965:29"/>
water, they all pointed at him;
therefore to confirm and fulfill
the myſtery of them in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-adminiſtration,
he did retain
the ſubſtance thereof; namely,
that wherein the Harmony and
the Analogy doth appear. And in
the Legal waſhing there are two
Types, which did prefigure the
Truth which is fulfilled in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.
The one is of <hi>Aaron</hi> and
his Sons, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 4. who were to
be waſhed before they were initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
into their Office; the other
is of the Lepers, who were to be
waſhed before they were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the Camp, and again
waſhed before they were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into their Tent, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Both theſe waſhings
are compleated in Baptiſm; for
by it we are initiated as Prieſts to
ſerve God; and by it our leproſie
is cleanſed, and we are received
both into the common Camp,
and then alſo into the peculiar
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115965:29"/>
Tent and ſtation belonging to us
in the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and
all this Initiation was typified by
that waſhing, but now it is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in true believers by this
waſhing. For Chriſt did retain
the Element of water in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
by reaſon of the natural
properties which it hath moſt fit
for his ends in the Inſtitution: The
natural property of water is clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
&amp; flowing out or over, as it is
applyed. In reſpect of the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
property which water hath,
Baptiſm is inſtituted, to ſignifie
and ſeal the vertue of Chriſts
blood, which purgeth from the
guilt of ſin, for the juſtifying of
believers; and the vertue of the
Holy Ghoſt to purge away the
ſpots thereof, for the ſanctifying of
believers: So the vertue both of
Chriſts Death, and of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
is exhibited to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by Baptiſm in the Inſtitution,
and in this ſenſe we are ſaid to be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115965:30"/>
dead with Chriſt in Baptiſm, and
to be raiſed with him again, <hi>Rom.</hi>
6. 3. till 12. <hi>Item</hi> it is a waſhing of
Regeneration and renewing of
the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5, 6. and we
put on Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. that is, we
are clothed with his death and life,
and put in a condition like unto
him; as the waters of life, that
is, the graces of the Spirit flow
from him, ſo by him they flow
from believers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 38, 39. And
as great and deep waters, that is,
afflictions, did overwhelm him in
the dayes of his fleſh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 7.
with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. &amp; 5. 8. So we are
to be partakers of the ſame ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
and to be mortified with
him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. and to drink of
his cup, and to be Baptized with
his Baptiſm, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 22, 23.</p>

                           <p>For Inſtruction againſt a three-fold
error concerning water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
1. Of thoſe that would

that make dipping eſſential to it,
3. Of thoſe that make it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſarie for Salvation.</p>
                           <p>They who would make it void,
do it upon ſeveral accounts.</p>
                           <p>Some would make it void be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Johus</hi> Baptiſm was only with
water, and he ſaith of Chriſt's
Baptiſm that it ſhould be with the
Holy Ghoſt and fire, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 11,
from hence they would infer, that
Chriſt commanded his Diſciples,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. not to baptize
with water, but only with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt in the nature and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of fire.</p>
                           <p>The Anſwer to this is, that they 1.
Miſtake Chriſt's meaning, in the
Commiſſion given to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;
for if Chriſt had not meant
that they ſhould have baptized
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115965:31"/>
with water, they would not have
done it, as we ſee clearly they did:
therefore their practice being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
according to their
Commiſſion; it is the beſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of his meaning. 2.
Chriſt's making Diſciples by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Baptiſm,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1. doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contradict their interpretation
of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt's words, as if
Chriſt would make no uſe of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Baptiſm;
therefore the words
of <hi>John</hi> muſt be underſtood
not Excluſively of water-Baptiſm,
but Incluſively, that is, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and above the outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
with water, he would baptize
alſo with the holy Ghoſt and fire
inwardly.</p>
                           <p>Others would make water-Baptiſm
void upon the account of
the ſpiritual perfection whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they pretend to have attained;
as thinking it uſeleſs when they
are baptized with the Spirit; and
upon this account they reject not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115965:31"/>
only Baptiſm, but all other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
But to theſe none other
anſwer is to be given but the
words of this Text, where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
argues directly contrary to
that which they alledge: for they
alledge that ſuch as are Baptized
with the Spirit ought not to uſe
water-Baptiſm; and the Apoſtle
argues directly contrary ſaying,
becauſe they are Baptized with
the Spirit, therefore they ought to
have water-Baptiſm adminiſtred
unto them. And then by Chriſt's
own action this error is refuted,
for he had the Spirit without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
before he was Baptized, and
yet he received <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm
with water, and ſaith, that it did
become him to do ſo, to fulfill all
righteouſneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 15. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he doth declare, that no ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
perfection doth exempt any,
but rather obligeth them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
outward ordinances.</p>
                           <p>A third ſort confeſs that water-Baptiſm
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115965:32"/>
was uſed by the Apoſtles,
but they deny that it was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to laſt after their Age, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Commiſſion to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
all Nations to be given to
them only, in their own Perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But
the Anſwer to this is that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
annexed to their Commiſſion,
ſhe wes that Chriſt would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with his preſence the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Diſciples by Baptizing
and teaching till the end of the
World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. now the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
were not to live till the
end of the World, but the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
function will laſt till then,
and therefore the promiſe is made
to it. Moreover the reaſon of the
inſtitution of Baptiſm laſting, the
adminiſtration of it muſt laſt; but
the reaſon of the Inſtitution is to
make Diſciples and to obliege
them to be taught; and this being
to laſt till the end of the World,
the Ordinances by which Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are made muſt alſo laſt.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="33" facs="tcp:115965:32"/>
There be ſome that think the
circumſtance of Dipping ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to Water-Baptiſm that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it the Baptiſm is invalid, and
their argument is taken from the
ſenſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> as if it
ſignified nothing elſe but dipping.
But firſt they are not rightly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
concerning the Word, for it
ſignifieth alſo waſhing and dying;
and ſo it is uſed, not only among
profane authors for waſhing, but
alſo in <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 3, 4. Secondly they
are miſtaken in that which they
call eſſential in Baptiſm, for in the
outward application of water
there is nothing eſſential but the
cleanſing vertue w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>. it hath; for
therein conſiſts the Analogie of
the Signe and Seal to aſſure us of
that which is exhibited: now the
propertie of cleanſing is applyed
not only by dipping, but by
ſprinkling, and waſhing, and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
out of water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God promiſeth
to his people that by ſprinkling
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115965:33"/>
clean water upon them they
ſhould be clean from all their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs.
<hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 25. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
tels us, that we are waſhed in
Chriſt his blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. and that
our Conſcience is thereby purged
from dead works, more effectually
than the unclean under the Law
were by the ſprinkling of the
blood of an Heifer ſanctified to
the purifying of the fleſh, <hi>Heb. 9. 13
14.</hi> and we are ſaved by the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Regeneration, or the Laver
which is ſhed on us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5, 6.
Sprinkling then, and waſhing and
ſhedding out of water to cleanſe,
is equivalent to dipping, for the
eſſence of Baptiſm is not in the
manner of applying water, but in
the cleanſing faculty which is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
to ſignifie and ſeal the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
cleanſing which Chriſts
blood and ſpirit doth exhibit to a
believer in the word of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                           <p>The third error is concerning
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115965:33"/>
the abſolute neceſſity of outward
Baptiſm to be ſaved. This is
grounded upon Chriſt's words, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you be born of the Spirit and
Water, you cannot enter into the
Kingdom of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 5. But
the anſwer is, that Chriſt's words
are miſunderſtood, they ſignify no
more than that which <hi>John</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Math. 3. 11. the Holy Ghoſt and fire,</hi>
that is, the Holy Ghoſt working in
the nature of fire, ſo the Spirit and
water, is the Spirit working in
the nature of water. It is a figure of
ſpeech called <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> that is, one
thing by two expreſſions. Fire
and Water are purging Elements,
their operation is in one ſpirit, and
the Prophet <hi>Iſai.</hi> joyneth them
together in one effect, <hi>Cap. 4. 4.
When the Lord ſhall have waſhed away
the filth of the Daughters of Sion,</hi>
and <hi>ſhall have purged the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem
from the midſt thereof by the
ſpirit of judgement and the ſpirit of
Burning,</hi> here the Spirit doth waſh
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115965:34"/>
and burn to purge away ſin. This
then is a groſs miſtake of the
phraſe, but as to the thing it ſelf,
that ſalvation doth not depend
upon the uſe of outward Water,
is clear from, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. where the
Apoſtle telling us that Baptiſm
doth ſave us, doth immediately
to prevent a miſtake explain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and ſaith, that he meaneth
not <hi>the putting away the filth of the
Fleſh,</hi> (viz. by outward water) <hi>but
the anſwer of a good Conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God by the reſurrection of Jeſus
Chriſt;</hi> that is the Baptiſm which
ſaveth the Soul, and therefore
Chriſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. ſaith, <hi>he that
beleeveth and is Baptized ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but he that beleeveth not ſhall be
damned,</hi> he ſaith not, he that is not
Baptized ſhall be damned, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that there is no ſuch neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of water-Baptiſm that without
it a Soul cannot be ſaved, for the
promiſe is to faith alone, <hi>whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
beleeveth in him ſhall not periſh but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115965:34"/>
have life everlaſting,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. and
the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. aſſures us,
that in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, neither Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
nor uncircumciſion availeth any
thing, but Faith which worketh by
Love.</hi> The ſaving <hi>vertue is in the
waſhing of Regeneration &amp; renewing
of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Tit. 3. 5. which
words are a clear expoſition of
Chriſts words, <hi>except ye be born of
the Spirit and water, ye cannot enter
into the Kingdome of God,</hi> Joh. 3. 5.
for the waſhing of Regeneration
by the renewing of the Holy
Ghoſt which is ſhed on us, is to be
born of the Spirit and Water;
and without this none is ſaved,
that is none, enters into Gods
Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>Yet although the ſaving of Souls
doth not depend upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
waſhing, nevertheleſs we ſay
there is ſome neceſſity for the uſe
of Baptiſm, namely, the <hi>neceſſitas
praecepti,</hi> that is a neceſſity to obey
Gods command; for as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115965:35"/>
ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19. of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
that neither it nor uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
is any thing, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
of Gods Commandement;
ſo we ſay, that <hi>to be baptiſed is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and</hi> to <hi>want Baptiſm is nothing,
but the keeping of the Commandements
of God;</hi> the meaning is, that the
outward work, or the <hi>opus opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
whether you have it or want
it, is not to be regarded; but the
keeping of Gods commandement
is that which is neceſſarie: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſay, that Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to adminiſter Baptiſm is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to be obſerved in his
Church, according to his end for
which he did appoint it; which is,
not to make Salvation to depend
upon material Water, but to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterize
and ſeparate Diſciples
from the reſt of the World, and
to conveigh as an outward teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
the manifeſtation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
work of Grace exhibited in
the word of the inſtitution, and to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115965:35"/>
theſe ends it is a means appointed
by God, and by reaſon of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
it is neceſſary to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
as a means to ſhew forth the
Relation which is between Chriſt
and his members, it is a means ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to ſignifie and ſeal their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffing
into one body by one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
with him as their head, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
13. So far then as God will have a
publick viſibility of the profeſſion
to be owned, and our Relation to
Chriſt in the Covenant to be
held forth, ſo far is publick Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
neceſſarie: now this is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
neceſſary than as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
will permit it to be done
Regularly; that is, by a Lawfull
Miniſter, in Chriſts way: for the
Baptiſm of Women is not Lawful,
nor of any other, who hath not
a Call to adminiſter the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
Nor is it the want but the
contempt or wilfull neglect of
Baptiſm that brings guilt. Saint
Ambroſe ſaith of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115965:36"/>
Emperor, that though he dyed
without Water-Baptiſm, yet he
had the Grace of Baptiſm, becauſe
he earneſtly did deſire it.</p>
                           <p>Hitherto the uſe of Inſtruction.</p>
                           <p>The uſe of Comfort is two-fold.</p>
                           <p>1. That God doth condeſcend
to our weakneſs to give us a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ſenſible Word, to make us
feel in the outward man, that
which he doth in the inward; this
is a great ſupport of our faith, and
a real ground of Comfort, which
God makes uſe of to conveigh by
the word of promiſe the increaſe
of Grace unto our Souls.</p>
                           <p>2. That God doth mark us outun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himſelf, and by a viſible token
of his Covenant in our outward
Man, will ſeal a Relation between
him and us (as <hi>Gen. 17. 11, 13.)</hi> This
is a ſpecial Confirmation of his
free Grace and Love: and that he
by this means will ſeparate us
from the World as a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115965:36"/>
and a choſen generation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 9. It is a ground of Confidence
to us, that he will have a ſpecial
care of us in evil times, for the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
bind up the Teſtimony and
Seal the Law among his Diſciples,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 16. His Church which is
made up of theſe Diſciples are his
Vineyard which he doth keep
and water every moment leſt any
thing hurt it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 2, 3. It is
his Garden encloſed, a Spring
ſhut up and a Fountain ſealed,
<hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 12. This gives us a ground
in time of trouble and temptation
to fly unto him, &amp; to mind him of
his Covenant with us in Baptiſm,
and to tell him as <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Pſal.
22. 10. I was caſt upon thee from the
womb, thou art my God from my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
belly, be not far from me, for
trouble is neer.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The uſe of Admonition and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
is</p>
                           <p>1. That we ſhould mind our
Covenant with God in Baptiſm,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115965:37"/>
what the tenor of it is; what our
Relation is to him; what it is to
be his Diſciple; how we ſhould be
under his Diſcipline; how ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from the world, the Devil,
and the Fleſh; how carefull, as
good Souldiers, to war faithfully
under his Banner? the Ancients
called it <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of the oath which Souldiers
took to be faithfull unto their
General, and <hi>Teſſera Militaris,</hi> a
token of their Warfar, to war
againſt the luſts of the Fleſh, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>

                           <head>Concerning the Second Queſtion.</head>
                           <p>If the Queſtion be, to whom
Baptiſm is to be adminiſtred, the
Anſwer from the Text will be
this, That it is to be adminiſtred
to ſuch as have received the gift
of the Holy Ghoſt; that is, to
ſuch as God doth own to belong
to him. For the Apoſtles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115965:38"/>
to prove that <hi>Cornelius</hi> and
his company ought to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
is grounded upon this max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im;
whomſoever God doth own
as his, they ought to be ſet apart,
as his. But theſe God hath own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as his by the viſible gift of the
Spirit, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Now the viſible way
of owning <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
was peculiar to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
of thoſe times; and
the force of his argumeut to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that they ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
doth not ſtand in it further,
than as it doth evidence that God
did own them to belong to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
For the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition,
which is an univerſal truth, &amp; the
ground of the whole inference, is
tacitly preſuppoſed and included
in the words, <hi>received the Holy
Ghoſt as well as we;</hi> as if he had
ſaid, God owns them as he did us,
therefore they muſt be baptized,
as we are. For whomſoever he
doth own, to them belongeth the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115965:38"/>
token of his owning of them.</p>
                           <p>From this ground of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
Argument we inferre two
things. Firſt, wherefore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
of believing Parents ought
to be baptized. Secondly, what
the qualification of Aged people is
to whom Baptiſm is to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, concerning Infants, we
take the Apoſtles Argument thus,
and ſay; If God doth own the
Infants of believing Parents as
his, then they ought to receive
the token of his owning of them.
But God doth own theſe Infants
as his: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they ought to receive
the token of his owning of them,
which is Baptiſm.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition, that
God doth own the Infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
as his, is manifeſt from
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. where the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
that although but one of
the Parents is a believer, yet the
Infants are holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, owned
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115965:39"/>
by God as his, by vertue of the
Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
which is, that he would be the
God of him, and of his ſeed. This
is a Goſpel-covenant, and made
with <hi>Abraham</hi> as a believer; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with all believers as well as
with him: <hi>For the promiſe</hi> (ſaith
the Apoſtle) <hi>is to you and to your
children, and to all that are afar off,
even as many as the Lord our God ſhall
call.</hi> The promiſe that God will
be their God, is made not only to
believing <hi>Jews</hi> and their children,
but to all believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo,
whom God doth call to the faith
of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Hence it is, that
Chriſt declares that the Kingdom
of God belongs unto them, and
commands the Diſciples to ſuffer
them to come unto him, and was
very angry with grief (<gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>)
that they did forbid them to
come, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 13, 14. This is
recorded, not as a meer Hiſtory of
the time, but as Chriſt is yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115965:39"/>
to day, and for ever the ſame,
ſo this command, <hi>Let little children
come to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> is in force ſtill: If then
children ſhould be brought unto
Chriſt, they muſt be brought to
the Ordinance where he is to be
found, and which they are only
capable of, which is the token of
the Covenant: For they being
owned by him by the promiſe of
the Covenant, and by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to ſuffer them to come to
him, the Apoſtles Argument doth
ſtand firm for them, that they
ought to be baptized; that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the ſign of his owning of
them. The promiſe is, that all
the families of the earth ſhould
be bleſſed in <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12. 3.
&amp; 22. 18. Children are a chief
part of a family; and when God
made his Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
he received all his family
him with, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17: 12, 13. And the
Apoſtles did baptize whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<hi>Acts</hi> 16. 15. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 16. For
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115965:40"/>
the Head of a family being own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
God would have all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
unto it to be owned;
and hereupon at <hi>Philippi, Paul</hi>
doth promiſe to the Jaylor of the
priſon, that if he believed in
Chriſt, he ſhould be ſaved and
his houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 31. Now the
Apoſtle could have no warrant to
promiſe this unto him, if he had not
lookt upon the promiſe made to
<hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12. 3. &amp; known Gods
Counſel, that he would propagate
his Church, not by ſingle perſons,
but by families. But if it be
(as it is commonly) objected, why
is there no command for the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
of Infants, as well as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing
them under the Law?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
includes children, and
therefore no need of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
mentioning of them. 2. The
Promiſe is as expreſſe to children
as to Parents, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. and
therefore no need of an expreſſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115965:40"/>
command. 3, It had been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
to give a new command for
children, ſeeing they were in
poſſeſſion of the priviledge to be
owned as belonging to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
they had been owned
ever ſince <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, and
were in actual poſſeſſion of their
right, therefore to give a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
concerning them again to
be owned, had been not only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
but abſurd; as if their
title to the priviledge had been
doubtful. Therefore I conceive
that there is no command given,
nor any example mentioned, but
in the general of a houſhold; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their intereſt was preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be known by all, and
the practice was undoubtedly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
to Baptize whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
                           <p>And thus much concerning
the right of Infants unto Baptiſm.
As for Aged perſons, if the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
be who amongſt them ſhould
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115965:41"/>
be baptized. The Anſwer will
be, ſuch as are ſo qualified, that it
doth appear that God doth own
them as his. Now God doth own
as his, not only ſuch as received
the gifts of Propheſying, and
ſpeaking with ſtrange Tongues,
as <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company did,
but all that profeſſed Faith, and
did repent, were engaged by
Faith and Repentance to walk
anſwerable to their profeſſion.
And upon this account the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch
was baptized by <hi>Philip, Acts
8.</hi> For having been taught the
knowledge of Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 30. till
36. and then having made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of his Faith in Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 36,
37, 38. he was baptized, although
he had not received any ſuch gift
of the Holy Ghoſt as <hi>Cornelius</hi> and
his company. Nay it is ſo far
from this, that the extraordinary
gift which <hi>Cornelius</hi> received, was
pre-requiſite as a qualification for
Baptiſm, that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>
                              <pb n="51" facs="tcp:115965:41"/>
doth promiſe to theſe, who ſhould
repent and be baptized, that the
Holy Ghoſt ſhould be beſtowed
upon them, <hi>Acts 2. 38, 39. Repent</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>and be baptized every one
of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt for
the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the gift of the Holy Ghoſt; for
the promiſe is to you and to your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and to all that are afar off even
as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi>
So that we ſee Repentance and
Faith fits men for Baptiſm, and to
theſe the gift of the Holy Ghoſt
is a conſequent in the ordinary
diſpenſation, although in this caſe
of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the gift of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt was diſpenſed before
Baptiſm.</p>

                           <p>1. To encourage Parents to
preſent their children to God,
and to teſtifie their intereſt in his
Covenant on their behalf: If
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115965:42"/>
they deſire God to be the God of
their children, they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
them to him, and accept of
the priviledge which belongeth
unto them, to put them in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of it. <hi>Marc.</hi> 10. 14. it is ſaid
that when Chriſt had reproved
his Diſciples for hindering the
children to come to him, he <hi>took
them up in his arms, laid his hands
upon them, and bleſſed them.</hi> When
they are brought to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and receive the ſeal of
the Covenant, he takes them in
his arms, layes his hands upon
them, and bleſſeth them.</p>
                           <p>2. To oblige Parents to teach
their children the Tenor of the
Covenant, and upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
they have been owned by
God, and what their duty is to
live unto him. If under the Law
Parents were obliged to teach
their children, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 7. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
under the Goſpel this
ought not to be rejected, where
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115965:42"/>
there is a Covenant under better
promiſes.</p>
                           <p>3. To teach us to obſerve the
Qualities requiſite in thoſe who
are to be baptized; that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
may not be adminiſtred,
either too ſcrupulouſly or too
negligently.</p>
                           <p>It may be adminiſtred too ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly,
when ſuch a diſtinct
knowledge of all the heads of
faith and duties is ſtood upon,
which may become one who is a
large proficient in Chriſtianity. It
is to be underſtood, that if they
have the knowledge of the main
object of our Faith and Hope,
with a deſire to be ſaved by
Chriſt, although they know no
particular controverſal matters,
yet they ought, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
to be admitted to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm;
for they are baptized to
be made diſciples, and being
ſuch, to be taught and directed
in the wayes of God, according
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115965:43"/>
to Chriſts commandement in the
Inſtitution of Baptiſm, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.
19, 20. make Diſciples, Baptize,
Teach. Again, it will be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
too ſcrupulouſly, if Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
ſhould be ſuſpended upon
the account that he to whom it
is adminiſtred, ſhould be embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
into ſome particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation;
for Baptiſm is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
to make a man a member
of any particular Society, but to
make him a diſciple, and to own
him as a member of the Catholick
Church viſible: For all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Congregations make but one
body, unto which, all particular
believers belong, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. &amp;
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. till 21.</p>
                           <p>It may be adminiſtred too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly,
if no reſpect be had to their
knowledge, whether it be of the
fundamental truths, that Chriſt
is the Son of God, the only Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and that whoſoever doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and believe in him for the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115965:43"/>
miſſion of ſins, ſhall be ſaved; and
if no reſpect be had to the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
of their intention, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they deſire Baptiſm, yea or
no, for the true end, to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to Chriſt as his diſciple in
the Covenant, to be taught and
guided by him; or whether they
deſire it onely for ſome worldly
by-ends, as many hypocrites have
done.</p>
                           <p>And now to make the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of this to the perſon in
hand, and the preſent action; we
can teſtifie of the Qualification of
the perſon, that he hath more
than a competent meaſure of
knowledge in Chriſtianity, both
in matters of Faith and of Duties;
and that his life is anſwerable
thereunto, as having renounced
all for Chriſts ſake to come to live
amongſt Chriſtians, in a penitent,
humble, ſober, and mortified
ſtate, ſeeking onely to be found
in Jeſus Chriſt, for the obtaining
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115965:44"/>
of the remiſſion of ſins, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
through him. This
being known to us to be his aym
and his profeſſion; and having
earneſtly deſired upon theſe
ground, and upon the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Faith which he made in one
day, to be baptized, we may
warantably and cheerfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to adminiſter the holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
unto him, and ſay with the
Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in my Text, <hi>Can any
man forbid water, that this man
ſhould not be baptized, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Graces of the Holy Ghoſt as
well as we?</hi> For by his Confeſſion
of Faith, it will appear that he is
largely enlightned and taught in
the Truth by the Holy Ghoſt;
for not being able either to read
or write, and dictating this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
according to certain heads
which were given him, and doing
it readily in one day, it is evident
that he hath received a large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Grace, which fits him for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115965:44"/>
Baptiſm. Here the Confeſſion

faith towards God, and they
are obliged every one to take
an example by the grace of
God, which brings Salvation
to receive it, and to make uſe
of it: And the Doctrine of
Repentance is applyed unto
them that are tranſgreſſors of
the Law, to ſhew them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
wicked works, which
are firſt Atheiſm, Idolatry,
falſe and Superſtitious wayes
of worſhipping the true God,
all irreverence and abuſe of
his Name, and all profanation
of the Lords Day, and neglect
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115965:49"/>
of his Solemn Worſhip, and
ſecondly, to teach them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all worldly luſts, that
is to ſay, all diſobedience to
Superiors, Murther and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
Adultery and Villany,
Falſe witneſs-bearing, and
all Concupiſcence, deſiring
things that pertain to his
Neighbour.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the Doctrine
of Faith is to be made uſe of
towards thoſe that have the
uſe of reaſon,<note place="margin">8. Of the Doctrine of Faith.</note> to teach them
that God is, and that he is
the Saviour of thoſe that ſeek
him diligently, that they may
know him, and fear him, and
put their confidence in God
the Father, who hath made
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115965:49"/>
all things, and in Jeſus Chriſt
his only begotten Son, who
having redeemed us, is gone
up into Heaven, and is ſitting
at the right hand of God,
where he makes Interceſſion
for us, and from thence he
ſhall come back in glory to
give unto Believers their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
hopes, and in the Holy
Ghoſt, by whom the Church
of Saints is gathered, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and governed in this
world, to be exalted in glory
in the world to come.</p>
                        <p>I believe that God doth
require good workes,<note place="margin">9. Of good works.</note>
that thereby he may be
glorified amongſt men,
and we muſt do them, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115965:50"/>
we may ſhew our love to
him, and to his glory,
and our thankfulneſſe to
his mercy, that we may
have aſſurance in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and that we may build up
our neighbour in the good
way: Moreover, the Organ
by which the Believers do
good works is the life of the
Spirit of Chriſt in them,
which makes the children of
grace free from the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſin, and leads them in
all truth, that they may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the Tenor of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to obſerve it; alſo thoſe
that are faithful unto God in
the Covenant of grace, makes
uſe of their graces towards
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115965:50"/>
Chriſt to remain in him, and
in his word and in his love,
and to follow him in their
affection, and actions, that in
all things they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to his Image.</p>
                        <p>I believe in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Almighty,<note place="margin">10. The Creed.</note> maker of
Heaven and Earth, and in
Jeſus Chriſt his only begotten
Son, our Lord, who was
conceived of the Holy Ghoſt
born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> did
ſuffer under Potius Pilat, was
crucified, dead and buried,
and deſcended into Hell; the
third day he roſe from the
dead, he is gone up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
ſits at the right
hand of God, from thence
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115965:51"/>
he ſhall come to judge the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and the dead. I believe
in the holy Ghoſt, the holy
Univerſal Church, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſins, the Reſurrection
of the Body &amp; life everlaſting.</p>
                        <p>Our Father which art in
Heaven,<note place="margin">11. The Lords Prayer.</note> hallowed be thy
Name; thy Kingdom come,
thy will be done on Earth as
it is in Heaven; Give us this

us our treſpaſſes as we
pardon them that treſpaſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, and lead us not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
temptation, but deliver us
from the evil one, for thine is
the Kingdom, the Power

<hi>Amen.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:115965:51"/>
I believe the Ordinances
of Baptiſm and of the ſupper
of the Lord are Organs to
ſuch as are Diſciples to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Communion of
Saints,<note place="margin">12. Of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> to ſeal the promiſes
and to confirm the graces of
the Covenant to believers
and to their of-ſpring, and to
diſtinguiſh them from the
World.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt having eaten the
Paſſeover with his Diſciples,<note place="margin">13. Of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</note>
in the night in which he was
betrayed, did inſtitute the uſe
of the holy Supper, that it
ſhould be celebrated after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to remember his death,
and to ſhew it forth till he
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115965:52"/>
come again. In the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he took bread, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given thanks he break it
and ſaid, Take, eat, this is my
Body which is broken for
you, do this in remembrance
of me, in like manner after
Supper he took the Cup, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
This Cup is the New
Teſtament in my blood, do
this as oft as ye drink thereof
in remembrance of me; he
did make uſe of bread and
Wine, to let us know that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as the Body is nouriſhed
with meat and drink, ſo alſo
the Soul doth receive its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
nouriſhment from him
in reſpect of his Body and
blood given to us.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="73" facs="tcp:115965:52"/>
I beleeve that Ieſus Chriſt
did inſtitute the Baptiſm af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Reſurrection,<note place="margin">15. Of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his aſcention into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as an effect and a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
that he hath received
all power in Heaven and
Earth, and the Diſciples are
commanded to adminiſter
the ſame, to make it appear
that all the Nations of the
Earth are made ſubject unto
him as to their Saviour, and
that being ſubject to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
they ought to render
obedience of Faith unto him,
and to believe in the Name
of the Father, of the Son, and
of the holy Ghoſt according
to the ſcriptures of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115965:53"/>
and Apoſtles upon
which the Believers are built,
Jeſus Chriſt being the chief
Corner ſtone, the ſcriptures
are the word inſpired by God
to make men wiſe unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the Faith which is in
Jeſus Chriſt, to make them
perfectly inſtructed unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good work, for Doctrine
Correction and inſtruction
in Righteouſneſs. Moreover
I believe that Baptiſm ought
to be adminiſtred in the name
of the Father, of the Son, and
of the holy Ghoſt, to ſhew
forth that the Father, the
Son and the Holy Ghoſt
are the only true God in
whom we ought to believe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115965:53"/>
and whom we ſhould obey. I
believe alſo that all believers
are baptiſed by the holy
Ghoſt into one Body, and
that every one of them being
members of this Body in his
place, become members one
of another; The waſhing
which is inſtituted in Baptiſm
doth ſignifie the waſhing of
Regeneration by the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the holy Ghoſt, which
is ſhed abroad by Jeſus Chriſt
upon believers. I believe alſo
that this waſhing is a ſign of
the new Covenant eſtabliſhed
in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt
into which we are received by
the Teſtimony of a good
Conſcience towards God, in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115965:54"/>
giving our ſelves wholly over
unto him, according to the
tenor of his Covenant, to be
taught and governed by him
in all things as his Diſciples;
in this waſhing which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all believers to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
all they who are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Jeſus Chriſt as to their
Maſter, or head, to become
his members, are baptized by
him into one Spirit, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one Body, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themſelves the one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the other as his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in the Communion of
Saints. I believe that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and inward Baptiſm of
the Souls which doth purifie
the Conſcience from dead
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115965:54"/>
works, makes believers care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to keep all the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
of God, and gives
them acceſs to call upon the
name of the Lord at the
throne of grace, to be helped
in due time. I believe that
that the Commandements
which ought to be obſerved
are given by <hi>Moſes</hi> and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by Chriſt, and the prayer
by which we ſhould make our
requeſts known to the Father,
is taught by the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi>

                           <note place="margin">14. Of the Church &amp; Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</note> I believe that the Church

of life and the Ordinances of
Truth which are appointed to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115965:55"/>
the things which beget and
increaſe grace, and to reform
vices and ſcandales. I believe
that the Ordinances of the

Word and Prayer (for thoſe
that are Miniſters or Paſtors
whoſe office is to propheſie
and pray in the Church) are
the Organes by which God
doth beget faith in men, and
to make them compleat in all
other graces, as Saints for the
building up of the body of
Chriſt. I believe that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of the Church and
Government of Diſcipline
ought to be adminiſtred by
the office of Elders, and are
Organs to prevent and reme-
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115965:55"/>
the ſpiritual adultery and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

                        <p>I believe that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                        <p>My Spiritual Father. This

that believe in him with a

                        <p>I am inclined to pray my

The Confeſſion being read, and
the fulneſſe of it being taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, the Miniſter went out of
the Pulpit down to the Font, at
which he ſate, and ſtanding by
him, asked him three Queſtions.
Firſt, whether he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
before God and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Sect?
whereunto he anſwered, yea, he
hid renounce it utterly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whether he did not
deſire to make profeſſion of the
Chriſtian Faith, and to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghoſt, as a diſciple of Chriſt?
whereunto he anſwered, yea, it
was his earneſt deſire.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whether he was not
reſolved in the future courſe of
his life to ſubmit himſelf to all
the Ordinances of Chriſt, and to
walk unblameably under Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Diſcipline? whereunto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
yea, it was his ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:115965:58"/>
Theſe Queſtions &amp; his Anſwers
were made in the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue,
and interpreted afterward unto
the Congregation in Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Then a Prayer was made for a
bleſſing upon the Ordinance to
be adminiſted unto him, deſiring
the Lord to be preſent with his
Spirit, to ſeal and exhibite the
thing ſignified thereby, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made partaker of the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Covenant, his walking
may be anſwerable thereunto,
and he may be delivered from all
the Temptations of the evil one
henceforth, to be filled with joy
and comfort by the Holy Ghoſt,
and other requeſts to this effect.
Which being done, the Miniſter
dipt his head into the water of a
large Font, and poured water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, ſaying, <hi>Richard Chriſtophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
I Baptize thee in the name of

and of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Then the Miniſter returning to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115965:58"/>
the Pulpit, exhorted the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to obſerve to the Glory of
God, the freedom of his Grace
and Election, that he did out of
the midſt of a moſt damnable Sect
call this ſoul to himſelf, in a way
more than ordinary; and that
we ſhould praiſe God for the
work of Grace beſtowed on him,
and that we might hope that God
was preparing by ſuch meanes a
way to bring in the Converſion

the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> amongſt which the
<hi>Turks</hi> ſhould be comprehended,
of whom this man and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

might expect hereafter a full Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.
They were alſo exhorted
to rejoyce with and for him, that
he was now in the boſom of the
Church, that they ſhould embrace
him in their hearts through the
Communion of Saints, and pray
for him.</p>
            <p>Theſe Exhortations being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115965:59"/>
the Action was concluded
with a Prayer, and the ſinging of
a part of a Pſalm.</p>
            <p>And this Relation is thus made

Gods works, to give him due
praiſe for the mercy which he
ſhewes to any ſinners; and to
pray that he would dayly add
ſuch as belong to his Election un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Proſelyte may be made inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to advance his Glory to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his own Nation in due
time, being delivered from the
Temptations and Aſſaults which
Satan hath made upon him in a
way not ordinary, wherein the
Lord hath hitherto graciouſly
ſupported him, and whereof here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in due time ſome more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

the ingenuous and true-hearted
Chriſtian, that various and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
