         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. TAYLOR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received your LETTER, <hi>May 2. To Your Apoſtate
Friend,</hi> N. N.</p>
            <p>Sir, I was much ſtartled at the firſt ſight of the Direction, and
wondered who it ſhould be, that was become an Apoſtate. And I thought
of all thoſe Perſons I had heard of, who were reputed the Authors of
the Letter, called, <hi>The</hi> Lancaſhire <hi>Levite Rebuk'd:</hi> thought I, is there
any of them turn'd <hi>Turk,</hi> or Papiſt? I never heard any ſuch thing. But
may be Mr. <hi>T.</hi> thinks the Author is quite gone from the Communion of
the <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>E.</hi> becauſe he could not Pray with them formerly, <hi>That God
would Strengthen</hi> K. J. <hi>in the true Worſhipping,</hi> &amp;c. But this, I can aſſure
you, is not ſo. For I can now keep on my Knees at that Petition for
K. <hi>W.</hi> (tho' ſome others will not) and heartily ſay, <hi>We beſeech thee to
hear us, good Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I was preſently ſatisfied, this was not the Reaſon; but, becauſe
<hi>I had denied my Chriſtian Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My firſt Wonder then ceaſed, but a ſecond aroſe in its ſtead; that you
ſhould ſay, <hi>That I had denied my Chriſtian Name, or at leaſt were
aſhamed of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray' Mr. <hi>T.</hi> When was the Time, where was the Place, who was
the Perſon, to whom <hi>I deny'd my Chriſtian Name?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remember not that I ever did deny it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have not been Re-Baptized,
nor taken a new Name, nor am I aſhamed of that which was
given me in Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>But I confeſs, I concealed my Name in my Letter to you. And if it
will pleaſe or pleaſure you, I'll give you ſome Reaſons, why (tho' the
Fortune of <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Pompey</hi> be not concerned therein) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
it.</p>
            <p>1. To avoid the Blows of the contending Parties. For it's often the Fate
of them that interpoſe as Friend to both, not only to fail of their deſired
Succeſs, to make them Friends; but to diſoblige both, and to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
more Enemies of thoſe, who out of Kindneſs they endeavoured to
<pb facs="tcp:47500:3"/>
reconcile. And this I find too true from both Parties. But, <hi>Am I become
your Enemy, becauſe I tell you the truth?</hi> Gal. IV. 16.</p>
            <p>2. I was not willing to diſoblige you; for I feared, in ſome heat, upon
the reading of your Book I might be ſo far tranſported, to give Words
that I might find cauſe to repent of; for I am a Man ſubject to like
Paſſions as you are. Yet (whatever Miſapprehenſions you may have of
me) I have a greater Reſpect for your Self, and another angry Man that
ſpits Fire againſt Diſſenters, than I doubt I can make you believe. And
it was your tart Cenſures and Reflections upon Diſſenters, that extorted
from me ſome Expreſſions, that you may think are not friendly.</p>
            <p>And for theſe Reaſons, and another you have in my <hi>P. S.</hi> I gave you
to underſtand, <hi>That if any unbecoming Words had overſlipt me, I beg'd
your Pardon.</hi> Pag. 28.</p>
            <p>In this I hope I ſhall treat you with all the Civility that is meet for
your Character, (tho' there are many Provocations;) and ſome Epithets
in my former, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I wiſh were expunged. And I was really concerned,
ſoon after it was out of my Hands, becauſe having occaſion to go to
<hi>Mancheſter,</hi> I there in Diſcourſe heard a very Learned and Judicious
Man, no Diſſenter, commend a Sermon you had Preached there. So I
was troubled, leſt any thing in my latter ſhould be an Occaſion of leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening
your Reputation, and ſo be a Prejudice to your Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>But after I underſtood, That others leſs Judicious were offended at
your Sermon, becauſe, they ſaid, it was like a <hi>Presbyterian Sermon.</hi>
Theſe were the High <hi>Tories</hi> and <hi>Jacobites,</hi> who called you <hi>Taylor</hi> Upon
<hi>Titus.</hi> Such Blades there are, that nothing pleaſeth them that is
ſerious.</p>
            <p>Again, I have been told, that your Father was ſometimes Haſty, (as
we ſay) but his Paſſion was ſoon over: inſomuch, that a Man-Servant
that lived with him would ſay, <hi>I am glad when my Maſter gives me
a Lauke,</hi> (a <hi>Lancaſh.</hi> Word, which you underſtand) <hi>for I am ſure
preſently after have a Piece of Silver from him.</hi> And I ſuppoſed you
might be of the like Conſtitution, the Sign of a good Nature, as we
ſay. Therefore I concealed my Name, that I might not provoke to that
you might afterward ſee cauſe to be troubled at, and could not be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died;
for,—<hi>Litera ſcripta manet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. I did alſo conceal my Name, to avoid the Ill-will of ſuch as might
miſtake any thing in it, towards my Perſon. And to prevent the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of all, and to ſave my ſelf the trouble of Anſwering impertinent
Queſtions; and avoid the fruitleſs Diſcourſe of one or other about the
Letter.</p>
            <p>4. Poſſibly there might be ſome Apprehenſions of Club-Law from
ſome Malignant Spirits, by <hi>Innuendo's;</hi> remembring poor <hi>De Laune,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> &amp;c. and what you had ſaid about <hi>Crab-tree.</hi> And if this
<pb facs="tcp:47500:3"/>
do not ſatisfy why I conceal my Name, I want not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of Good Men; amongſt whom I know you will, with me, own the
<hi>Author</hi> of <hi>The Whole Duty of Man,</hi> to be one.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> you hint at another Reaſon, why I am an Apoſtate, <hi>Becauſe
I chang'd the</hi> Presbyter <hi>into</hi> Levite.</p>
            <p>For this I muſt tell you, I did not know of that Title, 'till I heard
of it by a Friend, who had it from <hi>Ephraim Johnſton,</hi> for whom your
Letter is Printed, nor ſaw it, 'till the Letter came down Printed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> T. <hi>the next thing you blame me for, is,</hi> That I make Perſonal
Reflections upon the Morals of Men that are dead; <hi>for,</hi> De Mortuis nil
niſi Bonum. <hi>To this I ſay:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Your Maxim is not univerſally to be obſerved. For then we muſt
have no Hiſtories of Bad Mens Lives, and Vices, to deterr the Living
from ſuch Enormities, as the Dead have been guilty of.</p>
            <p>2. I muſt give you to underſtand, That it's ill Chidden, for your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon the Dead. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> and <hi>Jeſſe, Bee,</hi> and 17, for ought I
know, Worthy Men gave me the Occaſion to reflect on <hi>W. C.</hi> in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not only of Diſſenters, but the <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>E. Lev.</hi> p. 18, 19. and you have
done it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with a Witneſs in this Letter to Mr. <hi>Pendlebury,</hi> in Words at
length, and not in Figures. Whereas I did but put two Letters, which
could not affect him much farther, than where he was known, or the
Places where he acted his Villanies.</p>
            <p>3. I did it in Faithfulneſs: To intimate to the Reverend B. of <hi>C.</hi> for
future Caution; for I heard a Diſſenter ſay, he had ſent the B. Word by
a Rev. Divine, <hi>That it was not for his Honour, to permit ſuch a one
as</hi> W. C. <hi>in a Place, which he ſuppoſed, was in his Own Gift.</hi> I am
perſwaded that Ingenious Man forgot to tell him.</p>
            <p>But I know not how to excuſe ſome, that are more peculiarly called in
the Canon Law <hi>The B. Eyes,</hi> who knew of his Tricks immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he went to <hi>Motteram,</hi> and (I doubt) were not faithful to that Good
Man. And therefore I am ſtill of the ſame Mind, in pitying the
worthy <hi>B. B.</hi> that cannot ſee at diſtance without others Eyes, <hi>&amp;c.
Lev.</hi> p. 18.</p>
            <p>And thus I have acquitted my ſelf from Blame, for reflecting on the
Morals of <hi>W. C.</hi> tho' dead. Beſides, his were Villanies notorious; not
like your Inſinuations, which follow to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You ſay,</hi> Should I engage you my Friend, upon the ſame Ground that
you do <hi>W. C.</hi> I could name as many of your Miniſters, and put <hi>C's</hi> and
<hi>N's</hi> to them too, who are yet alive, that labour under the ſame Guilt, <hi>&amp;c.
And ſo you threaten the Living and the Dead; but for the Dead, you
will be modeſt.</hi> De Mortuis.—</p>
            <p>But for the Living, you are very free of your Blows, and are prepared
for more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47500:4"/>
But had you not need to conſider well before-hand, whether it be
lawful or convenient for your ſelf to caſt Firebrands, leſt ſome ſhould fall
upon your own <hi>Houſe</hi> or <hi>Head,</hi> and you not be able to quench it. Yet if
you have a Mind of <hi>Billingſgate-Stuff,</hi> let me as a Friend adviſe you,
not to be too raſh, but look to it; that it be for the Honour of God, and
the Service of the Church, and your own Reputation; and that it be
<hi>true,</hi> and <hi>well atteſted;</hi> remembring, <hi>your own,</hi> and every other Man's
Name and Reputation is in another Man's Hand and Power. And that
there have been, and are evil Surmiſings, and groundleſs Suſpitions,
which are miſchievous, and of ill conſequence; and that many a Good
Man hath ſuffered unjuſtly, and been heavily burthened under it, tho'
innocent; as the Learned <hi>Hooke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> that wrote the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Policy,</hi> &amp;c.
and that if it be not true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you can make no Reſtitution. And ſuppoſing it
ſhould be true, it may be it was ſecret, and not ſcandalous; and it may be
(if Perſons be old) it is long ſince repented of, and never reiterated.</p>
            <p>Theſe evil Surmiſes and invidious Reflections, are an Indication of a
corrupt and rotten Heart, and of a weak Cauſe; and the Perſons whoſe
Cauſe, and in whoſe Excuſe you Threaten, cannot be Juſtified by a Recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination:
and this might beget a Recrimination with <hi>Letters</hi> in ſome
angry Perſons, that might think themſelves touched. And indeed it's to be
lamented, that there may be found too many Inſtances.</p>
            <p>There are ſome yet living, no mean Clergy-Men, guilty in that kind.
And if I loved a Stink, it's eaſy to tell you of one that was worſe than <hi>Gr.</hi>
and <hi>L.</hi> that never Married the Party. And in another Caſe, to Parallel your
Story of Mr. <hi>Pendlebury;</hi> (as true, as that he Married his Wife with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Parents conſent,) whoſe Name lives, and will, when others ſhall be
written in the Earth. I can tell you of one, who gave himſelf the Title

               <head type="sub">Diſſenters Not Guilty of Popery.</head>
               <p>IN the Letter, which ſomebody (I know not who) Intituled, <hi>The</hi>
Lancaſhire <hi>Levite Rebuk'd,</hi> I undertook to Vindicate <hi>Diſſenters</hi>
from the Charge of <hi>Popery,</hi> or Errours looking that Way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> T. <hi>you ſeem to deny your Charge in</hi> Pag. 45. <hi>of your</hi> Letter to
Apoſt. Fr. <hi>for you ſay,</hi> My Friend either could not find one place in all
my Book, to fix the Charge on; or elſe he found it ſo fully proved, that
he ſaw it neceſſary to connive at it. <hi>And you farther ſay,</hi> You own
Diſſenting Miniſters were Tools of <hi>Popery.</hi> And this was all I charged
them with, upon this Head of <hi>Popery.</hi> Pag. 5.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> you are in ſo much haſte, that you have overlooked or forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
your Charge; therefore I ſhall take leave, (leſt I ſhould be thought
to bear falſe Witneſs againſt you) to ſhew you, This was not all you
charged them withal. But I'll tell you,</p>
               <p>1. What you charge them with <hi>more</hi> of <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. How they are acquitted in my Letter. For which you ſay, <hi>I have
the Impertinence to ask, What Errours in Doctrine, looking that Way?</hi>
in your <hi>Pag.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Your Charge of</hi> Popery, <hi>is in the firſt Lines of your</hi> Preface, <hi>next
after your Names; and it's in theſe Words,</hi> The Foundation, whereof I
am an unworthy Member, being intended for the Preſervation of His
Majeſty's Subjects from falling into <hi>Errours,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as tend to
<hi>Popery.</hi> And a late Scandalous Pamphlet, intituled, <hi>The</hi> Surey <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi>
looking that Way, <hi>&amp;c. Here is your Charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. I now ſhew you, how I endeavoured to diſcharge them.</p>
               <p>1. By taking notice, you did not proſecute your own Charge put in
againſt them; for you Indict them of <hi>Errours</hi> tending to <hi>Popery;</hi> and
when you ſhould Prove, you Drop your Charge, and bring no Evidence.
So they are in courſe acquitted. But the Defendants not ſatisfied, expect
the Accuſer ſhould acknowledge his Fault, for Scandalizing of them.
And to clear themſelves, they put in their Plea, and prove themſelves
Not Guilty; by Anſwering the particular Inſtances, that can be thought
could affect the Caſe. And therefore,</p>
               <p>2. I anticipated what I thought could be ſaid againſt the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi>
and only two things could with any Reaſon be objected. 1. Either that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47500:5"/>
they held ſome Errours in Doctrine. 2. Or, that they practiſed ſome
things <hi>tending that Way; viz.</hi> Towards <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if you prove neither, the Bill ought to be quaſht; and ſo you
come under the Crimination <hi>your ſelf,</hi> which you would have fixed on
<hi>me;</hi> of <hi>Bearing Falſe Witneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for Errours in Doctrine, the Matter was ſoon over, being none
was objected in particular. And I ſuppoſe you did not expect that I
ſhould find any tending to <hi>Popery,</hi> when your ſelf could find none; tho'
you had charg'd their Book with ſuch Errours.</p>
               <p>3. I enquired what they had done, that tended altogether towards
<hi>Popery;</hi> here you lay in a particular Charge.</p>
               <p>1. That they were conſtant Tools of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. They Pray'd on Suppoſition; and ſuch Praying juſtifying the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> Prayers to Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi> You object, they are <hi>conſtant Tools of</hi> Popery. And for
my Information, you bring a Book called <hi>Philanax Anglicus;</hi> to prove,
They Cut off the <hi>Royal Martyr</hi>'s Head. <hi>Pag.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solution.</hi> I anſwer, excepting againſt the Witneſs a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> We
have Miſchief too much from ſuch villanous Witneſſes, who account
nothing unlawful to ſay or do againſt Hereticks, to promote the Catholick
Cauſe.</p>
               <p>This Book was written, with a Deſign to caſt the <hi>Odium</hi> of K. <hi>Ch.</hi> I.
on the Proreſtants; except ſome few, whom he calls (if I remember
right) <hi>Proteſtants of Integrity:</hi> I ſuppoſe he may mean ſuch as B. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Parker</hi> of <hi>Oxf.</hi> or <hi>Barrow;</hi> to whom add, if you will, your
Dr. <hi>Heylin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Book was Anſwered ſo well by Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> that he was highly
Careſſed by ſome Great Miniſters of State in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's
Time; that for certain were no <hi>Diſſenters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if you except againſt him, as a Party, I ſhall refer you to a Canon
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the ſame Reign, and Chaplain to K. <hi>Ch.</hi> II. Dr. <hi>Peter
du Moulin,</hi> who Anſwered that Book, and calls it, <hi>Purum putum Menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium,</hi>
Right Metal of Untruth; and calls the Author, <hi>Philopapa;</hi> and
Dedicates it to the then B. of <hi>London,</hi> Sheldon.</p>
               <p>Now would you not be angry, if I ſhould call you Tool of <hi>Popery;</hi>
becauſe from them you derive your Authority to call <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſo.</p>
               <p>Again, you refer me to a Book, I ſuppoſe, called <hi>Foxes and Firebrands;</hi>
an Author, may be, of the ſame Kidney.</p>
               <p>Now to be even with you, I have already given you two for two; and
to gratify you, I'll add a third, <hi>viz.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
or <hi>Proclamation,</hi> appointed to be Read in Churches Annually,
before <hi>Jan.</hi> XXX.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you ſend me alſo to freſher Inſtances; to prove, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47500:5"/>
                  <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are Tools of <hi>Popery;</hi> viz. <hi>Addreſſes</hi> and <hi>Speeches</hi> to the late K. <hi>J.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> I will refer you to Cart-loads of <hi>Addreſſes,</hi> and <hi>Abhorrences,</hi>
and <hi>Sermons, Curſings, Excluſioners,</hi> and their Poſterities; which may
be as much worth, as <hi>Diſſenters Addreſſes</hi> and <hi>Speeches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, you may add if you will, R. Rev. and Rev. <hi>Careſſes</hi> and
<hi>Speeches</hi> at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and the Clergy meeting him alſo. And whoſe Tools
were they? I am aſhamed to name theſe things, but you extort them.
<hi>Dat veniam Corvis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now how ſhould <hi>Diſſenters</hi> pleaſe ſome Fools? One while they are
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Tools, for their Diſloyalty; and in the next Breath, they are
Tools for their Loyalty.</p>
               <p>Now ſince the happy Eſtabliſhment of King <hi>William</hi> on the Throne,
I ſuppoſe you and <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are agreed in your Loyalty. But ſome
<hi>Jacobite</hi> would, if he durſt, ask you, How you could diſpence with your
Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance and Paſſive-Obedience, and your Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
<hi>That it's not Lawful,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>Diſſenters</hi> do heartily Bleſs God
for ſuch a Revolution.</p>
               <p>And for Mr. <hi>Jolly</hi>'s Speech, and <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Addreſſes at that Time
you mention; there was none preſented, nor did Mr. <hi>J.</hi> make a Speech.</p>
               <p>2. Farther, I had ſaid, <hi>Lev.</hi> pag. 9. <hi>What are they to be Blamed for?
Are they to be Blamed for their</hi> Faſting <hi>and</hi> Praying? <hi>Did they uſe</hi>
Popiſh Exorciſms, <hi>or</hi> Popiſh Ceremonies?</p>
               <p>Now to prove they had done nothing to be Blamed for, in their
<hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Praying;</hi> becauſe whether it was a Cheat, or whether it was
a Natural Diſtemper, yet they ſuppoſing and believing here was a <hi>Devil,</hi>
and the Man really being under a great Affliction, they Faſted and Prayed;
(according to the Advice of St. <hi>James,</hi> Chap. V. <hi>If any be afflicted, let him
Pray.</hi>) And what is here to be Blamed, or what was here done tending
to <hi>Popery?</hi> Now what ſay you now?</p>
               <p>1. You blame their Prayers, becauſe they were upon a Suppoſition;
and would juſtify <hi>Papiſts</hi> Prayers to Saints.</p>
               <p>2. You charge me with miſrepreſenting your Words, and with Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Stories.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>You ſay,</hi> If the Suppoſition be falſe, the Worſhip is Superſtition.
<hi>And by aſſerting this,</hi> I am a Friend to <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> if a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
be the Ground of Devotion. For <hi>Papiſts</hi> pay Adoration to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Altar, on the belief that Chriſt is perſonally there; and they
Pray to Saints and Angels on ſuppoſition they can hear. <hi>Lett. to Apoſt.</hi> p. 6.
<hi>With ſeveral impertinent Reflections, nothing to the Argument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> To this I ſay: 1. Mr. <hi>J.</hi> and the reſt did not make a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of it; for they did verily believe that <hi>D.</hi> was a Demoniack; and
thought there were the ſame Symptoms with ſome Demoniack in the
Goſpel, which (I remember not that) you have offered any thing againſt.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47500:6"/>
               <p>2. But becauſe I ſaid, they Pray'd on that Suppoſition, that <hi>Dugd.</hi> was
a Demoniack, they were not to be blamed therefore. I anſwer, <hi>That all
Worſhip upon a Suppoſition, is not Superſtition.</hi> For their Prayers were
not Superſticion: Becauſe,</p>
               <p>1. Their Prayers for <hi>Dugd.</hi> were to a lawful Object, God, in the Name
of Chriſt; and not like the Papiſts Adoration of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Now here ſome Fanatick would fall upon you, and ſay, Whether
is more excuſable, he that adores the Sacrament of the Altar, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
Chriſt is there Perſonally, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or he that adores the Altar, or before
it, when Chriſt is not there, either Perſonally or Repreſentatively. Unleſs
they ſuppoſe him there, when there is no reaſon to believe it, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is Superſtition with a Witneſs.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Prayers were not only to a Lawful Object, but for a
Lawful Thing; that God would releaſe an afflicted Man, and one they
thought a Demoniack, from the power of Satan. And that their Prayers
were not Superſtition upon this Suppoſition, may appear by alike In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
as, ſuppoſe you be abſent from your Wife and Children, I hope
you Pray for them when at a diſtance, ſuppoſing and believing them to
be alive; but it's poſſible at the ſame time ſome of them may be dead,
and you know it not. Will this Suppoſition, which is not then true,
make your Prayers Superſtition?</p>
               <p>K. <hi>Ch.</hi> II. was Pray'd for publickly after he was Dead, for it could not
be known at this diſtance. Were your Publick Prayers then for him,
Superſtition?</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>You charge me with miſrepreſenting your Words and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
Stories,</hi> Pag. 5. <hi>becauſe I had ſaid,</hi> That you deny, that a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or Preternatural Diſtemper can be attended with a Devil; and that
it was no good Argument to prove that <hi>Dick</hi>'s was no Poſſeſſion, becauſe a
Diſtemper. <hi>Lev.</hi> Pag. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Sol. 1. <hi>I did not ſay theſe particular Words were yours. But I'll tell you
why I judg'd the</hi> Argument <hi>to be yours: 1. From P. 22. of Sur.</hi> Imp. <hi>to
P. 28. you go about to prove</hi> Dugd.<hi>'s Fits</hi> to be a Cheat, or that there
was nothing in his <hi>Fits,</hi> but what was Natural. <hi>Doth it not hence follow,
that here was no Devil? Which to prove, you fetch in the Authority
of Dr.</hi> Willis, Ratcliff, <hi>and</hi> Buckley. Ratcliff <hi>ſaith,</hi> Pag. 30. Theſe
ſtrange Geſtures and Actions were not Diabolical, but Preternatural.
<hi>Whence you draw this Concluſion;</hi> You ſee by the help of my good
Friends, I may hope to parallel the <hi>Surey</hi> Gambals, and ſatisfy all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſs'd
Perſons; from the Symptoms that attend Convulſive Diſtempers;
of what? That for any Feats ſhewn by <hi>Dick,</hi> there was no neceſſity for,
and therefore no reaſon to admit the preſence of <hi>Rich.</hi> Ludicrous <hi>Daemon,</hi>
to Play the <hi>Merry-Andrew.</hi> Sur. <hi>Imp.</hi> Pag. 31.</p>
               <p>Now this was either to prove from theſe <hi>Medium's,</hi> that it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47500:6"/>
was a Cheat, or Natural Diſtemper, and therefore no <hi>Daemon;</hi> or it
was not.</p>
               <p>1. If it was not, to what end was it produced? and what ſignifies
your Authorities? For I have told you, it might be a Cheat and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination,
and yet a <hi>Daemon;</hi> as in the Caſe of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira;</hi>
and be ſure there was a Diſtemper, as in thoſe Demoniacks in <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.
and <hi>Mark</hi> 9. And if this was all you intended to prove, why do you
lay ſuch heavy Charges againſt the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> for believing here was
a <hi>Daemon;</hi> which you ſay, but do not yet prove, is an Impoſture, and
not to be believed to be a <hi>Daemon;</hi> but a wild Story.</p>
               <p>2. If it was to prove that there was no <hi>Daemon,</hi> which your Words
above ſeem to imply, then my Charge is not unjuſt.</p>
               <p>And if your <hi>Whalley</hi>-Sermon advance the quite contrary Opinion, as
you ſay, <hi>Lett.</hi> p. 5. which contrary Opinion is, if I miſtake not, <hi>That
becauſe a Diſtemper, therefore attended with a Devil; and that you affirm,
that Natural and Preternatural Diſtempers may be attended with a Devil.</hi>
And if this be ſo, you quite give up the Cauſe. And why here might not
be a <hi>Daemon,</hi> (for you have no other Argument I can find) I yet
underſtand not from you.</p>
               <p>Thus you kindly gratify the <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> and with the leave of your
Conceſſion, they may (if they pleaſe) ſtill believe a <hi>Surey</hi>-Demoniack;
only you ſeverely treat them about Matters of Fact, and the manner of
their Management of the Affair. And indeed, if you had in the <hi>Spirit</hi>
of <hi>Meekneſs, blamed</hi> them for it, and <hi>admoniſhed</hi> them as miſtaken Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
(tho' you be not their <hi>Dioceſan;</hi>) and not Hectored, and
treated them with ſo much Scorn and Diſdain, to render them and their
Party contemptible, I would not have blamed you. But, <hi>I admoniſh,
I admoniſh, I admoniſh;</hi> and then immediately, <hi>Take them</hi> Derick;
I like not. Meekneſs and Forbearance, is better than a Word and a
Blow. The Apoſtle's Canon is better. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1.</p>

Pag. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Now you ſay I impute to you, <hi>The charging</hi> Diſſenters <hi>with</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47500:7"/>
Superſtition, <hi>but produce not ſo much as one Place in all your Book, to
Prove this Charge.</hi> Lett. <hi>pag.</hi> 6. To this, Mr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> hear my
Defence.</p>
               <p>1. I did, in the <hi>Lev.</hi> p. 10. give you part of the Words where you charge
them with <hi>Superſtition,</hi> in different Characters; and, but that I grudge
the toil of tranſcribing your Sayings, I might have added more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now I will let the World have it. In your</hi> Preface, <hi>p.</hi> 1. This Trade
which you have learned from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> was deſigned to enſnare honeſt
and well-meaning, but eaſy People; (<hi>here you judge Hearts</hi>) for ſince
neither you nor they can juſtify by Arguments, (<hi>here is their Ignorance</hi>)
your Superſtitions, (<hi>here is the preſent Charge</hi>) and Diviſions from the
Eſtabliſhed Church; (<hi>here is the next Charge</hi>) you were forced to fly to
little Shifts and Tricks, that by working on weak Peoples Fancies, you
might win thoſe to your Party by Craft and Wiles, (<hi>here's another
Charge</hi>) which you could not by Reaſon and Religion.</p>
               <p>Now let any impartial Man judge, whether I, or you, my unfriendly
Friend, are to be blamed. Is there no Word in all your Book, nor one
Place to prove the Charge?</p>
               <p>I think you are too young to need Spectacles, elſe I could very well
afford to buy a pair, to read your own Book; provided I might be ſaved
the trouble of Tranſcribing. But at laſt, you honeſtly confeſs the
Charge, <hi>Lett.</hi> p. 6. but with ſome unmannerly Rhetorick, which is no
Logick.</p>
               <p>But you have a High Charge againſt me, <hi>Pag.</hi> 6. which I muſt not
over-run; and it's no leſs than <hi>BLASPHEMY.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I perceive I muſt be at the drudgery of tranſcribing again, or elſe you
will ſay, <hi>I produce not one place in your Book, to Prove this;</hi> and then
they that read your Book, and not mine, will ſay I belye you. Now your
Charge is this.</p>
               <p>I muſt rank him either amongſt the Claſs of <hi>Ignoramus's,</hi> or I muſt
make him to Blaſpheme CHRIST. <hi>Lett.</hi> p. 6.</p>
               <p>Really Mr. <hi>T.</hi> I will give you leave to call me an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times, rather than to Blaſpheme Chriſt; tho' I ſhould hear of it
out of Pulpits and Coffee-Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as once befel a Jury, becauſe
out of Compliment to their Superiours, they would not find innocent
Perſons guilty, were called <hi>Ignoramus's.</hi> And to make me Blaſpeme, you
never ſhall; I hope I ſhould rather ſuffer my Tongue to be pull'd out of
my Mouth. But I ſuppoſe you mean, you will prove me a Balſphemer.</p>
               <p>And if that be it, put in your Charge, and I will anſwer.</p>

                  <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 18. Let him tell me, if according to his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of it, the <hi>Fearing</hi> of Chriſt may not be expounded by <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Pagans,</hi> for worſhipping of Devils. <hi>Lett.</hi> p. 6. <hi>And what then? Am
I a Blaſphemer? GOD Forbid!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, hear my Defence.</p>
               <p>1. Take notice, he falſly accuſeth me. I did not ſay the <hi>Greek</hi> Word
ſignifieth <hi>wholly</hi> a Worſhipping or Fearing of <hi>Daemons.</hi> The Heathens
did take it in a good ſence, with reſpect to their own <hi>Daemons,</hi> which
they worſhipped; yet in this very Place, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 18. they took it in a
bad ſence, as a ſtrange <hi>Daemon;</hi> as when we ſay a Falſe God; and <hi>Paul</hi>
ſo took it, <hi>Verſe</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>2. I will yet tell you for once, ſeeing you ask it, <hi>Whether</hi> Fearing <hi>of
Chriſt, may not be expounded by</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Pagans, Worſhipping <hi>of
Devils?</hi> I ſay, it may by them be ſo expounded, <hi>wickedly.</hi> Nay I'll
tell you more; that they call Chriſt here, in <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 18. a <hi>Daemon;</hi>
and ſo did the <hi>Jews,</hi> Joh. 8. 48. But pray' Friend what's that to me,
that <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> blaſphemouſly call Chriſt a <hi>Daemon;</hi> or the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
of Chriſt, the Worſhipping of Devils? Did I ever call Chriſt
a <hi>Daemon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Do you think that <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> did rightly call Chriſt a
<hi>Daemon?</hi> Or is this one of his Names? (I hope, not to Bow the Knee
to, when it's pronounc'd;) for then indeed your Accuſation of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi>
might have had ſome Colour; and ſo to worſhip a <hi>Daemon,</hi> might be to
worſhip Chriſt. And then to have <hi>called</hi> the worſhipping of Chriſt in
a good ſence, as a true Object of Worſhip, <hi>A Worſhipping</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi>
would have been Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>4. But again, if you think that Chriſt was properly and truly called
a <hi>Daemon,</hi> then <hi>Paul</hi> was as great a Blaſphemer after his Converſion, as
before: For he called the <hi>Pagans</hi> Worſhip, a Sacrificing to <hi>Daemons,</hi>
not to God; and he would not have the <hi>Corinthians</hi> have Fellowſhip
with <hi>Daemons.</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 10, 21.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Paul!</hi> Would you not have Men to worſhip <hi>Daemons?</hi> Why
Chriſt is a <hi>Daemon,</hi> and I hope we may worſhip Chriſt.</p>
               <p>5. Now according to your Logick, you might very juſtly charge <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi>
with the greateſt Villanies and Blaſpemies.</p>
               <p>What Wretches! offer to caſt a <hi>Daemon</hi> out of <hi>Dicky?</hi> VVhy Chriſt
is a <hi>Daemon,</hi> (by a very good Token, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> call him ſo, and
uſed the word properly; for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath told you, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf is ſo
called, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 18.) <hi>And caſt out Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Paul</hi> comes under Correction, by ſuch a Reaſon. VVhat, have no
Fellowſhip with <hi>Daemons?</hi> VVhy Chriſt is a <hi>Daemon,</hi> and muſt we not
have Fellowſhip with him? (Is this the Reaſon, why ſome in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits
cry out againſt <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> for talking of Communion with Chriſt.)</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:47500:8"/>
               <p>Nay Chriſt himſelf will come under Correction of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>T.</hi> for he caſt out a <hi>Daemon:</hi> Did he caſt out Himſelf? Such
Divinity is like Chriſt Eating Himſelf.</p>
               <p>And now Gentlemen, without Favour or Affection, Give in your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
VVhether am I, or my Accuſer, more Guilty of Blaſphemy?</p>
               <p>I remember a Story (for a diverſion) of a young Scholar in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
when examined, what he remembred of a Sermon Preached by the
Head of the Colledge; the ſaid Head of the Colledge asked him, what
was firſt, ſecond, or third Grace that he had mentioned to one, being
asked, VVhat was my ſecond Grace? the Boy anſwered, <hi>Ignorance:</hi> No,
ſaid he, <hi>That's thy Grace, it's none of mine.</hi> So I fear the <hi>Blaſphemy</hi>
will be Yours, not Mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> I would not willingly lay any thing to your charge unjuſtly;
and therefore I read, and read again, and thought to ſee if I could
put any other more favourable Conſtruction upon your Words; and
I am apt to think, (in Charity to you) there is ſome Miſtake, either
in Writer or Printer.</p>
               <p>But the Charge being of ſo high a nature, I cannot tell how it can
be proved in what you have ſaid, but by this meaning, which is partly
expreſſed, and partly neceſſarily implied in your Words, without
forcing of them into Nonſence.</p>
               <p>And if I miſtake, I will once more beg your Pardon, (provided you
quit me of ſo heinous a Crime) altho' you very unkindly denied me
once before, when I deſired it. For I perceive your Pardons are as hard
to be obtained for Love, as Popiſh Indulgences, or an Abſolution for
ſome Folks <hi>without Money;</hi> unleſs it be to <hi>Scotch</hi> Converts.</p>
               <p>One thing more, under this Head.</p>
               <p>I did tell you, that ſome Perſons would retort upon you the Charge of
<hi>Superſtition;</hi> for doing things in the Worſhip of God, which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commanded by GOD or Men; and are not neceſſary Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Decency or Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it was Queried;</hi> Where are you commanded, to Bow to the Eaſt?
or before the Altar to make Curt'ſies? <hi>Where commanded to ſtand up at
Te DEUM, Benedictus, Magnificat;</hi> or at Reading of <hi>Pſalms?</hi> and
bouncing and racketing, Prieſt one Verſe, and People another? <hi>is this
for Edification?</hi> Lev. <hi>p.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>I have ſought for an Anſwer, but yet find none; for which in Civility
I thank you, for eaſing me of ſo much Pains, of tranſcribing your
Anſwer, and Replying; which I could eaſily have done, by the very
Authority of a B. s <hi>Articles of Enquiry,</hi> into theſe Crimes before-mentioned,
and ſome other <hi>Probation-Ceremonies</hi> of the ſame nature.</p>
               <p>Farther, doth not he tranſgreſs a Rule or Canon, that goes <hi>beyond</hi>
what's commanded, as he that comes ſhort? Elſe, what a Gap would
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47500:8"/>
this open to an Inundation of Heatheniſh and Popiſh Rites, in the
Worſhip of GOD, and all the Offices therein?</p>
               <p>For why not Salt, Spittle, and Cream, and Chriſom in Baptiſm? Why
not Croſſing upon Croſſing in all Parts of Divine Worſhip? and many
other ridiculous Fopperies uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And for ought
I know, if the Parſon, Vicar, or Curate have a mind to uſe them, he
may do it as lawfully, as Bow at the Altar, Stand-up at <hi>Te Deum,</hi> &amp;c.
and Racket the Pſalms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are no way for Edification, nor are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Ch. of <hi>Engl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I think I have cleared my Self from being a <hi>Falſe Accuſer</hi>
and <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> and <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from <hi>Superſtition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And leave you to vindicate your Self, or thoſe that uſe Uncommanded
Rites and Ceremonies, from the Crime of <hi>Superſtition.</hi> Rom. II. 1.</p>

                  </hi> and am glad, you
have once Acknowledged, That I Charge you not Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly.</p>
               <p>I endeavoured to Clear them from Sinful, Schiſmatical <hi>Diviſions:</hi>
And what ſay you to it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You ſay,</hi> I pretend not to Vindicate them, as in other Caſes, from the
Guilt of it; but endeavour to Juſtify them in it. <hi>Lett.</hi> p. 7.</p>
               <p>To this I ſay:</p>
               <p>1. It's true thus far, That I vindicate them not from ſome Diviſions;
but juſtify them: <hi>i. e.</hi> Going to another Place, from your Church of
<hi>Wigan</hi> to <hi>Billinge</hi>-Chapel or St. <hi>Elms.</hi> for I think I need not, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
no Crime in either; and I gave you my Reaſon.</p>
               <p>2. I juſtify them from Diviſions in Doctrine, from the Eſtabliſh'd
Church; for they Subſcribe all the Articles concerning Doctrine, and do
not Preach againſt them when they have done. And ſo they divide not
from you in Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But</hi> Corah, Dathan <hi>and</hi> Abiram, <hi>&amp;c. did Subſcribe all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Faith.</hi> P. 8. And what then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. I have very often heard of theſe three Men, (as pertinently
may be, as that of Rebellion being Witchcraft, which was <hi>Saul</hi>'s Sin;)
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47500:9"/>
and I think them as bad Men as you can. But if really they Subſcribed
the Articles of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Faith, then in <hi>That</hi> they were neither Hereticks
nor Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſay, They ſeparate not from their <hi>Lawful Church-Governours;</hi>
and 'till they be proved <hi>ſuch Separatiſts,</hi> they are not to
be charged with ſinful Diviſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you call their Conventicles <hi>Schiſmatical, P. 20. Sur. Imp.</hi>
and their Diviſions, <hi>Unchriſtian.</hi> P. 69. Ibid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> You may call their Conventicles what you pleaſe; but it's one
thing to ſay, and another to prove: For I remember not any thing <hi>Steely</hi>
enough to force ſuch a Concluſion, and <hi>Flinty</hi> Words will not do it.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Again, you are about it, and about it; and ſay,</hi> Hark my Friend,
are not your Diviſions Unchriſtian? Do not your Conventicles make a
Diviſion? and ſo are Schiſmatical; for theſe are both one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Here's Learning, to puzzle Diſſenters; but I dare venture it with
ſome of the Lower <hi>Claſſes</hi> in Mr. <hi>Frank.</hi> Academy to Anſwer; will he
not preſently ſay, <hi>Syllogizari non eſt ex Particulari.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then I'll venture to tell you, that <hi>All Diviſions</hi> are not <hi>Unchriſtian,</hi>
nor <hi>Schiſmatical;</hi> for if ſo, then they that in this Dioceſe divide from
<hi>Cheſter</hi>-Cathedral, and go to worſhip God in other Churches and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,
are Unchriſtian and Schiſmatical. But I ſuppoſe you have ſome
other Meaning.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But,</hi> Its <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Diviſions are Schiſmatical and Unchriſtian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. In Anſwer to this I had given, <hi>Lev.</hi> p. 12. A Learned Man,
no Diſſenter, had call'd Schiſm an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Scare-crow,</hi> and you call
him a <hi>Socinian.</hi> But what's that to Diſſenters? He was certainly a Ch.
of <hi>E.</hi> Man. And let him be <hi>Socinian, Arminian, Calviniſt, Papiſt,
Millenary,</hi> in Doctrine; if he hath but a large Swallow, and can but
Subſcribe the Articles in Dr. <hi>Bramhall</hi>'s, and ſome others new-invented
Sence; and ſay he doth it <hi>Ex Animo,</hi> he is no Schiſmatick. And yet
Heretick and Schiſmatick ſeem with St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be the ſame, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
And if Diſſenters durſt but ſay what they believe not, they would be no
Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p>2. I told you, <hi>Lev.</hi> p. 12. That I had often heard and read, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
excuſe themſelves from the Guilt of <hi>SCHISM,</hi> which the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> charges them with, as you do Diſſenters. <hi>Becauſe that
Church required as. Terms of Communion, things doubtful, unlawful,
and ſinful;</hi> and make the Papiſts the Schiſmaticks, who are the culpable
Cauſe of Diviſions; and produce <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17.</p>
               <p>And I am apt to think, that if thoſe that have the Rule in the Church
would <hi>impoſe no other Terms of Communion,</hi> but what Chriſt the chief
Ruler hath enjoyned, all ſerious Chriſtians would live in <hi>Unity,</hi> tho' not
in every thing in <hi>Uniformity.</hi> And what Authority any have, to impoſe
more than Chriſt hath, I am yet to ſeek.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47500:9"/>
               <p>And this would be a Means to take away all Cauſes of Diviſions,
amongſt the Pious, and Humble, and Charitable CHRISTIANS.</p>
               <p>But for the Prophane, Irreligious, and Immoral, they will readily
comply with that Party which either indulgeth them in their Luſts; or
are moſt eaſy in overlooking, or cenſuring their Crimes.</p>
               <p>And if any others be unruly, in breaking that Unity and Concord
which Chriſt hath bounded, let the Paſtors of the Churches, according
to Chriſt's appointment, make uſe of the Spiritual Sword committed to
them; and then, <hi>Valeat, quantum valere poteſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for thoſe Enormities peculiarly under the Juriſdiction of the
Civil Magiſtrate, let them uſe their Sword, for the Puniſhment of
Evil-doers.</p>
               <p>3. Diſſenters think the Proteſtants Arguments againſt the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> will juſtify their preſent partial Withdrawing from the Ch. of <hi>E.</hi>
And of this their General Argument you take no notice, tho' you had ſaid,
<hi>They cannot by Arguments juſtify their</hi> Diviſions. <hi>Pref.</hi> p. 1. Surey <hi>Imp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ch. of <hi>E.</hi> have it in their Power at any time, to remove the Schiſm
ſo much complain'd of. <hi>Take but away all that Chriſt hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
as Terms of Communion, and the Schiſm ceaſes.</hi> And it's hard,
that Men ſhould make thoſe things Sin, which God hath not.</p>

were ſaid in the <hi>Lev.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Many Diſſenters do not totally divide from the Eſtabliſh'd Church;
they frequent their Publick Aſſemblies, hear the Word, join in their
Prayers, and <hi>ſome</hi> in the Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s Supper, and in all things that Chriſt
hath enjoyned as Terms of Communion; and leave them only in thoſe
things they think to be unlawful, that are of meer Humane Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>2. It was alſo ſaid, That Diſſenters are not ſo <hi>ignorant,</hi> but they
have ſomething to ſay for themſelves. And four Arguments were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
And what do you ſay?</p>
               <p>1. You acknowledge, <hi>You charge them home with Ignorance.</hi> Pag. 12.
and, <hi>That you are ſtill of the ſame Mind.</hi> And give your Reaſons,
why you charged them with Ignorance; becauſe they could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<hi>Arabick</hi> Characters, and ſome Cyphers, and ſuffered a Female-Friend
to be call'd <hi>Iſhcol;</hi> and at laſt you crow, <hi>What ſaith my</hi> Friend?
Profound Silence! And you ſay true in that; for I never undertook to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47500:10"/>
meddle with Matters of Fact. And it was only undertaken to vindicate
them from Ignorance in matter of Argument, to prove that they can
juſtify themſelves from the Charge of Diviſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for Matters of Fact, I am ſtill of the ſame Mind, and I will not
meddle, tho' you call me <hi>Ignoramus</hi> for it; but ſhall leave it to Mr. <hi>C.</hi>
and you, if you think it worth the while to wrangle it out; for ſuch
Pedantry is no way edifying to me.</p>
               <p>2. But what ſay you to their Arguments I am content here to
attend a Tryal of Skill.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>Their firſt Argument was:</hi> They cannot think it lawful
for any body to command things in the Worſhip of God, of the ſame
nature, uſe, ſignificancy and end, with God's own Appointments; when
there is no difference, but God Commands the one, and Men the other;
and make them neceſſary Terms of Communion. And they inſtance in the
Croſs about Baptiſm, a Humane Sacrament. <hi>Lev.</hi> p. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> To this you ſay: 1. <hi>If I knew not the Doctrine of the Church of</hi>
Eng. <hi>I am ſtill an</hi> Ignoramus; <hi>If I do know, 'tis a damnable Scandal.</hi> I ſhall
be now gored ſure, with the one Horn; yet I'll go on, here's yet no Blood.
Of this afterward.</p>
               <p>2. They calling the Croſs a Humane Sacrament, you are in a Huff, and
cry out, <hi>A Humane Sacrament! Prythee Friend talk Sence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> I reply, pray you Friend be not too haſty; I perceive you know
not who you ſpeak to. But I'll not take ill your Familiarity, provided
you will have Patience to hear my Defence. For I cannot eaſily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
I talk Nonſence; if I find I have done ſo, I'll ask Diſſenters
Pardon, for repreſenting their Arguments in Nonſence; and it ſhall be
hard but you and I will part Friends about this Matter.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Why may not I, betwixt you and me, call the Croſs a Humane
Sacrament?</p>
               <p>1. You are Book-learned, and therefore know the general Notion of a
Sacrament; you know in the <hi>Greek</hi> it ſignifies a <hi>Myſtery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and amongſt
the <hi>Latins</hi> it was a Military Term, ſomething like our <hi>Preſs-Money.</hi>
Now ſuppoſe I ſhould ſay, there are Sacraments <hi>Humane, Divine,</hi> and
<hi>Diabolical,</hi> I hope you would not again accuſe me of Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>Now the Heathens Myſteries and Sacraments were Diabolical, becauſe
inſtituted by the Devil, who enjoined them by his Oracles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> Sacraments of old were Humane, whereby they engaged
their Soldiers; tho' may be ſometimes, by ſome of their Religious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
as an Oath for Confirmation. However, they were but of Mens
Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>But there are other Sacraments amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> of which Two are
of Divine Inſtitution. But pray' what are the other Five, which the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
add? Why will you not admit them to be Sacraments? Is not one
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47500:10"/>
Reaſon, becauſe they are but of Humane Inſtitution? And what Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in Terms, if they be called Humane Sacraments? At beſt, the Croſs
is Divine in its End, Uſe and Significancy, but Humane in its Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>But if that Term will not yet pleaſe, I told you we would yet part
Friends, or it ſhall be your Fault; for I love not to contend <hi>de Lana Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prina.</hi>
Therefore, if you will, call it a <hi>Humane Appointment;</hi> and then,
<hi>Is it lawful for any body to command things in the Worſhip of God, of the
ſame nature?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. And now Diſſenters ſay, the Croſs is ſuch a Humane Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

willingly hear what ſhe can ſay for her ſelf; yea I would juſtify her as
far as I am able. And if you knew me, I think you would not be ſo harſh
in your Cenſures of me. Therefore that I might not be partial or unjuſt,
I did conſult her <hi>Rubrick,</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> particularly <hi>Can.</hi> 30.

               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>Their ſecond Argument was,</hi> They think it not lawful (<hi>ſome
of them</hi>) to kneel in receiving the Bread and Wine in the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> To this you ſay, <hi>My Friend is bewildred,</hi> &amp;c. and you ask me a
very important Queſtion, <hi>Do the Papiſts receive Wine in that</hi> Sacrament?</p>
               <p>Now for this time, rather than fall out with you, I'll anſwer you, The
Papiſts do receive Wine in that Sacrament, unleſs the Prieſts be no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts?
Juſt ſuch a Learned Queſtion once was asked, in as good earneſt
as yours. Pray' Sir, will you tell me one thing; What's that? Is the
Pope a Papiſt? Am I now bewildred?</p>
               <p>Having told you of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Offence at Kneeling, I thought good to
conceal their Argument; not that they are <hi>contemptible,</hi> but that <hi>I durſt
not Vouch for them;</hi> and ſo eaſed you of the trouble of Anſwering them:
Yet deſired <hi>modeſtly</hi> your help to anſwer one thing I had heard ſome of
them object, which I could not anſwer my ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> The thing was this. <hi>Some of them think it hard, that for

Supper, they ſhould be peremptorily denied that Ordinance: When by the
ſame Reaſon, if the Apoſtles were on Earth, and offered to do as they did,
even in the Preſence, and with the Approbation of their Maſter, they
muſt be denied it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now really Mr. <hi>T.</hi> you are very unkind here; for you give me no help
to anſwer them; but twit me with my Ignorance, when I had confeſſed
it in this Caſe; and had told you, I was not able to anſwer them. Was
this <hi>ingenuous?</hi> When in earneſt, I would have thanked you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> You cry, <hi>A ſad Story! if it be true;</hi> and is this all? No,
here's more. <hi>When-ever you can prove that the Apoſtles uſed the Poſture
that the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>now do, I will engage our Church ſhall indulge you
and your Brethren in the capricious Liberty of their pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</hi>
Really, a great and kind Undertaking. For my ſelf, you
know, I need not the Indulgence; but I ſhould be glad of it, for honeſt
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſake. Yet I much queſtion the Performance. For, if you
ſhould give it to any that Kneel not, the Penalty is <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> by
<hi>Can.</hi> 27. And I doubt you would ſcarce run ſuch a Hazard, for the
capricious Scruplers.</p>
               <p>Repl. <hi>Yet I fancy the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>will ſay,</hi> They do uſe the ſame
Poſture, for they Sit: <hi>Which was their Table-Geſture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will ſay, I know the Apoſtles Poſture was Diſcumbency; or a
kind of Leaning and Lolling in one another's Boſom. But again they
will ſay, Whatever the Manner was, whether croſs-leg'd, or with their
Feet under them, or Leaning ſideway on their Elbow, ſtill it was <hi>Sitting</hi>
however.</p>
               <p>Yet ſtill my Scruple remains. <hi>For if Chriſt's Apoſtles were now on
Earth, and would receive it in the ſame Geſture they did receive it from
their Maſter, and not Kneel, they muſt be denied it, by the</hi> C. <hi>of</hi> E. <hi>on pain
of Suſpenſion.</hi> For let Men be never ſo pious, holy, and good, they muſt
Kneel, or elſe be left in the ſame Predicament with the moſt prophane
Drunkards, Swearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea much worſe, (which I almoſt tremble
to write<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) for theſe, if they will but Kneel, cannot be denied; nor are
they, that ever I heard of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. Diſſenters <hi>Third Argument.</hi> The impoſing and tying of Men
to a particular Form of Worſhip, (<hi>without Authority from God</hi>) from
which none ſhall vary, is an Invaſion of GOD's Prerogative; and an
Impeaching of his Wiſdom; as if Men knew better than himſelf, what
Form or manner of Service were fitteſt for him. <hi>And what ſay you to this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. You tell me of a Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> But I think <hi>Diſſenters</hi> here meddle not with Parliaments, but
with the Ch. of <hi>Engl.</hi> in their Canons and Book of Common Prayers, and
other Rites and Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sol. 2. <hi>You ſay, I am a pleaſant Spark indeed; and then ask me another
grave Queſtion.</hi> Tell me, is Reading GOD's Word, Repeating his own
Commandments, Profeſſing our Chriſtian Faith, Addreſſing our ſelves
to him in his beloved Son's own Name, making Laws for him to obey?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> I anſwer, this is not making Laws for him no obey. But why
did you ask this Queſtion? I could alſo ask you Queſtions; but why
ſhould we trouble our ſelves and others, with asking and anſwering im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Queſtions? This looks like a <hi>Blind,</hi> to eſcape the Force of
Diſſenters Arguments unobſerved. For they will ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:47500:11"/>
1. That it's Terms of Communion which God hath not commanded
in his Word, and it's the Ch. of <hi>Engl.</hi>'s Form of Worſhip, which they
mean, which is impoſed; which God muſt have, or none; and which
all muſt uſe, or be puniſhed. This is making Laws, for God to obey.</p>
               <p>2. For Reading of God's Word, and Praying in his own Son's Name,
they do conſtantly ſo Worſhip God, becauſe God himſelf hath enjoined it.
But what's this to their Argument? I think I may promiſe, in behalf
of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> If the C. of E. will impoſe no more on them, than theſe
neceſſary things, they will chearfully obey, and thankfully comply.</p>
               <p>3. But if God muſt not have his Worſhip in Baptiſm, unleſs the
Miniſter do alſo Sign with the Sign of the Croſs; and God ſhall not have
his Worſhip in the Lord's Supper, unleſs Men will receive the Bread
and Wine Kneeling; or if God ſhall not have his Worſhip in Prayer,
unleſs the Miniſter ſay over ſo many <hi>Pater-noſters,</hi> and obſerve ſo many
Ups and Downs, ſo many Cringes and different Poſtures, in one and the
ſame Service; Standing up at the ſame Scripture read at one time, not at
another; Saying Aloud at one time, not at another: Then Diſſenters
think this an Impoſing upon God, making Laws for him to obey; and
that with a Penalty; for he muſt have this, or none.</p>
               <p>And 'till you have fairly anſwer'd this, I ſhall not think Diſſenters ſo
Ignorant as you repreſent them, <q>As not to be able by Arguments to
to Juſtify, <hi>what you call,</hi> their Superſtitions, and Diviſions from the
Eſtabliſhed Church. <bibl>

I ſhall diſoblige you, and forfeit the kind Appellation you give me, of

                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 
                  <q>Pray' tell me, (<hi>this is mannerly</hi>) what you call them, that make

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, If Men Swear and Lie, or Engage themſelves in the
Name of God to do any unlawful thing, or raſhly take an Oath, without
any regard to the Matter, whether right or wrong; or whether they
know what it is, or not: Yet rather than loſe their Preferment, will
ſay what comes next Tongues-end. I'll give you leave to name them;
and it ſhall be a very hard one, if I conſent not.</p>
               <p>But not to eſcape in the dark, I will be open with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. If in their Prayers, any make God content with whatever
comes next to their Tongues-end, and not from their Heart; I think, with
your leave, they cannot make God content with them; for he requires
Truth in the inward Parts. And if you will, call them Takers of God's
Name in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Yet another Queſtion. <q>How I'll call them, that will not be at
the pains to compoſe a Sober Form of Worſhip for God, but too often
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47500:12"/>
foam out their own Shame, and yet are not aſhamed to entitle it to,
but will needs have God admit it, for the Groans of his Spirit. <bibl>P. 15.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If you mean by Sober, a Grave and Serious Form of
Prayer, if any Perſon do Compoſe a Form in apt and pertinent, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
Words, fit to expreſs the Lawful Deſires of the Heart, and to raiſe
their Affections of Hope and Confidence in God, I would highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them. But if they ſhould be ſo in love with their own Prayer,
as to tye all others to their very Words, and none other; eſpecially if
they mix with their Form uncommanded Rites and Ceremonies, under a
pretence of Decency; I would ſay they are proud and conceited, and
aſſume an Authority that doth not belong to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. I did never hear any ſuch Prayers, as you ſpeak of; nor any
affirm, that <hi>what comes next Tongues-end,</hi> or that <hi>foam out their Shame,</hi>
and call them, <hi>the Groans of the</hi> Spirit. But I doubt too many ſay and
read their Prayers, only at their Tongues-end; that have no more to
think of, but how to Turn-over their Book-leaves, and Read right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. If any Miniſter in Publick conceive a Prayer, and ſpeak it
in apt Words, (eſpecially in Scripture-Words) with Humility and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence;
and the Matter be Lawful, and in the Name of Chriſt offered
up to the Throne of Grace, I would very heartily ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to it; and
believe God will graciouſly accept it from an honeſt Heart.</p>
               <p>And 'tis ſtrange, that Miniſters ſhould be diſcouraged from Improving
their Gifts, either in Compoſing or Conceiving ſuch Prayers, as (I think)
have been found by Experience, ſo much tending to Edification and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation;
and (I ſuppoſe) ſo eſteemed formerly, by the moſt ſerious Men
of the C. of E. who, 'till of late, conſtantly uſed them in the Pulpit.</p>
               <p>And ſome B's put it into their <hi>Articles of Enquiry,</hi> at their Viſitations:
<hi>Do you know of any Parſon, Vicar, or Curate, that never Pray before their
Sermons?</hi> The reſtraining of which, or diſcouraging at leaſt, is thought
by ſome one Occaſion of ſo many raw Divines, weak and ignorant, while
they need no other Qualification to perform their Office, than to be able
to Read well; that being the chief Work. And for <hi>Preaching,</hi> the Reading
of <hi>Homilies</hi> and other Mens <hi>Sermons,</hi> recommended by a R. R. B. to Young
Ones, with a Grace, or with the Spirit of <hi>Confidence,</hi> (as a Dignitary uſed
to Pray, in a compoſed Form) is ſufficient. Tho' this is by others thought a
Diſcouragement to <hi>Induſtry,</hi> and an Occaſion of <hi>Sloth, Idleneſs,</hi> and worſe.</p>
               <p>Obj. 4. <hi>The Fourth Argument of</hi> Diſſenters <hi>was this,</hi> Lev. <hi>p.</hi> 13. Some
of them think it no leſs than Sacriledge, to transfer the Ends of God's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
to their own Appointments: For they think we are Baptized, in
token, hereafter we ſhall not be aſhamed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that Baptiſm is the
Honourable Badge, whereby the Infant is Dedicated to the Service of Him
that Died on the Croſs; and ſhould not be attributed to the Sign of the
Croſs. <hi>What ſay you to this Argument of</hi> Diſſenters?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:47500:12"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You ſay, <hi>That Baptiſm is perfect without the Croſs,</hi> Can. 30.
and you ſay true. But they will Reply,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. They therefore think it unlawful for Men to add ſomething
of their own, to that which is well and perfect already, according to
Divine Appointment. Pray Friend, for once, let me ask a Queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is Croſſing good for?</p>
               <p>Sol. <hi>Why you'll ſay,</hi> It's an Honourable Badge, whereby the Infant
is Dedicated to the Service of Him that Died on the Croſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> 2. This is another thing, <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are offended at: That
the <hi>ſame Honour</hi> ſhould be put upon an aerial tranſient <hi>Sign</hi> of the
<hi>Croſs,</hi> of <hi>Men</hi>'s <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> that belongs to Baptiſm, a Sacrament of <hi>God</hi>'s
<hi>Inſtitution.</hi> And they think it inexcuſable Preſumption and Arrogance,
to ſet a Man's Badge, Cheek by Chawl, with Chriſt's Badge.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 3. <hi>You ſay,</hi> The Canon refers not to the Sign of the Croſs, more
than Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> 3. But the Canon ſpeaks only of the Sign of the Croſs, when it
ſays, <hi>It's a Lawful outward Ceremony, and Honourable Badge,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have objected, Theſe Ends of Baptiſm ſhould not be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the Sign of the Croſs. The Child is Dedicated already by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
and therefore needs not, ſhould not be Dedicated by the Croſs.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 4. <hi>To this you ſay;</hi> I ſhould have given this malicious Reflection
a hard Name, but that I pity my Friend's Ignorance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> 4. Truly Mr. T. it's not well done to pity, and give no help to
Anſwer <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> I doubt ſomething pinches, that provokes you. But
may be I may have ſome Relief; for,</p>
               <p>Anſw. 5. <hi>You ſay,</hi> Dedicate, among other things, is to Deliver up, with
ſome Solemnity, what belongs to another. And ſo the Child, by the Sign of
the Croſs is ſolemnly Dedicated to Chriſt, to whom he doth belong by <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> 5. This is fine indeed: The Child is <hi>Dedicated</hi> by the Croſs, who
was before <hi>Dedicated</hi> by Baptiſm: So you take upon you to mend what
was perfect before. And this is another Inſtance of your <hi>impeaching</hi> the
<hi>Wiſdom</hi> of GOD.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſaid, That Infants are Baptized, in <hi>Token</hi> hereafter,
they ſhall not be Aſhamed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo ſhould not be Croſs'd for the ſame
thing. But you have Croſs enough, and ſay nothing to this.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe a Perſon comes, with Authority, under the K.'s Broad
Seal, to Execute an Office; and ſome Man ſhould come and ſay, You
ſhall not act, unleſs you have my Seal alſo. Would not this be accounted
a Crime of an high nature?</p>
               <p>And if you will not take it ill, I'll tell you of a fifth Argument. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Read that which tells you, the Angel <hi>Raphael</hi> was the Son of <hi>Ananias</hi>
the Great. An Angel, <hi>begotten</hi> by Man! and call it a Leſſon; and juſtify,
That it's either the <hi>pure Word of God,</hi> or, <hi>that which is agreeable to the

               <p>Now I'll tell you, why I dropt it.</p>
               <p>1. I found a General Charge of <hi>Knavery;</hi> Sur. <hi>Imp.</hi> Pref. <hi>p. 1. This their
Knavery, as well as yours, was diſcovered.</hi> But I found no particular
Inſtances: And would you have me to forge for you Inſtances, to prove
your General Charge.</p>
               <p>2. I looked upon your word Knavery, as only <hi>Billinſgate-Rhetorick;</hi>
or a Malignant Reflection upon the Party; where I thought you very
unjuſt, and therefore dropt it.</p>
               <p>And you needed not to have given your ſelf ſo much trouble, in
ſearching your Book for all the Crimes, mentioned to be charged upon
them; all are in the very firſt Page of the Preface of your <hi>Sur.</hi> Impoſtor.
And the next Charge of <hi>Injuſtice</hi> alſo, in Reflecting upon the whole Party
of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> for the Miſcarriages of a few.</p>
               <p>In Pag. 15. <hi>of your</hi> Lett. <hi>you ſay,</hi> There is one thing remains, and that
moſt plauſible in all my Friend's Book, that I have charged on the whole
Party, the Miſcarriages of a few. <hi>And farther you ſay,</hi> Tho' my Friend
lay this to my Charge, yet he produceth not one Inſtance.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. T. in Anſwer to this, I will ſhew you the Reaſon, why
I accuſed you of laying the Miſcarriages of a few on the whole Party;
and let the Reader judge, whether I have wronged you.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Reaſon of the Charge, was from your Words in the Preface,
Pag.</hi> 1. I muſt, <hi>ſay you,</hi> acquaint (viz. <hi>the Reader</hi>) that it's an old
Juggle that your Predeceſſors the <hi>Puritans</hi> practiſed; but their Knavery,
as well as yours, was diſcovered. <hi>Here's</hi> Puritans <hi>and</hi> Diſſenters, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely.
And</hi> Pref. <hi>pag.</hi> 3. The Party, I imagine, ceaſed from ſuch Religious

2. The Reaſon why I brought no <hi>Inſtance,</hi> you had before. But are you
not to blame, to call a Man a Thief, tho you bring no Inſtances; and the
more faulty, if you can find none? And yet you ſtill go about to vindicate
your Charge, and fall foul on the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> becauſe they are not of your
Mind, to <hi>think the</hi> Demoniack <hi>was a Cheat;</hi> (and your ſelf charge not
this upon <hi>Diſſenters</hi> truly, unleſs you contradict your ſelf) and that they
did not by ſome Overt-Act, Cenſure it. As if every idle Book and Story,
publiſhed by Men of C. of E. and not Cenſured by an Overt-Act, did
involve them in the ſame Guilt with the Editors.</p>
               <p>And you go on, here were 17 Miniſters, one way or another, concerned
in the Narrative. And what of all this? Here were two Compilers of
the Narrative; but you charge them not with being the Authors of the
Impoſture, nor Contrivers of it.</p>
               <p>Six you call <hi>Aſſiſters.</hi> How are they aſſiſting? Not to carry on an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
or a Cheat, you are not ſo hardy as to affirm it. But they <hi>Faſted</hi> and
<hi>Pray'd,</hi> or <hi>Preach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               <p>Seven you call <hi>Atteſtors.</hi> But what do they atteſt? Not the Truth of
the Impoſture, but they believe the Truth of the Affidavits; and that <hi>D.'s</hi>
ſtrange Fits were by a Diabolical Power. And where is their Fault? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Men, upon their Oaths and Declarations, who were Eye-Wineſſes,
and whom they had no reaſon to ſuſpect of Falſhood; atteſting nothing
but what many others ſaw, and which your ſelf deny not to be true.</p>
               <p>Again, there might be 50 Hearers, and for ought I know, 500 Hearers
and Seers at one time or other: Muſt theſe be all <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries?</hi>
Some it may be, will ſay, It's ſo much liker to be no Cheat,
when all was done above-board; and many, not only Seers and Hearers,
but of the Witneſſes, C. of E. Men.</p>
               <p>And when all's done, how can you tell here was no Devil in the Caſe?
(ſome Arguments looking that way, to prove no Devil, you diſclaim)
And whether you have any more. I find not.</p>
               <p>And in fine, you Self quit all <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the Impoſture, only ſo
far as they were credulous, and were impoſed upon; and as guilty of
Pride, and Vain glory, and Inſincerity.</p>
               <p>And if they were credulous, it's not the only Property of <hi>Diſſenters;</hi>
for B. <hi>Hall,</hi> you hear, was ſo; and tho you pretend his Youth, when the
thing was done; yet when he wrote his Book, he was old enough to
judge; and it's probable had ſeen or heard of <hi>Harſnet</hi>'s Book.</p>
               <p>But for their <hi>Pride, Vain-glory,</hi> and <hi>Inſincer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty,</hi> Lyes and Forgeries,
which are all I remember you charge them with, (excepting what hath
been ſpoken to already) if they, or any of them can be proved Guilty,
(which will be hard for ſome of thoſe Crimes to be, unleſs you could ſee
into Hearts) then I ſhall heartily ſay Amen to your Prayer, <hi>That GOD
would open their Eyes, that they may repent,</hi> (the almoſt only ſerious
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47500:14"/>
Words I have met with in both your Books;) And I would pray farther,
That God would Pardon them, tho' I doubt you will not.</p>
               <p>And now, whether <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Tricks were from a Cheat, or a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or from Poſſeſſion, Obſeſſion, or all theſe, I am not concerned. But
ſomething here was ſtrange, and unuſual, and unaccountable, by what
I can judge from what all Parties ſay. But in one thing I take my ſelf
concerned, which is, whether the Word <hi>Obſeſſion</hi> be a Ch. of <hi>E.</hi> Word;
for I had ſaid, that it's to be found in <hi>Can.</hi> 72.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to this you ſay, <hi>p. 9. The</hi> Diſſenters <hi>finding the Pretence there
Cenſured, out of that Spirit of Contradiction to the</hi> Ch. <hi>of</hi> E. <hi>which they
moſtly act by,</hi> (this is very charitable) <hi>may be ſuppoſed not only to make uſe
of the Word, but the Impoſture alſo, which is there condemned.</hi> Here I
confeſs I am bewildred, and by a croud of Words brought into ſuch a
Cloud, that I know not where to find you, or what you intend. Let the
<hi>Canon</hi> 72 be conſulted, and I find not, either, 1. That they made a <hi>Canon</hi> to
condemn <hi>Obſeſſion,</hi> Word or Thing, no more than Poſſeſſion; nor do they
ſay it's a Popiſh Word. 2. Nor do they condemn Faſting and Prayer,
upon ſuch Occaſion; but with the B.'s Licence, they may Faſt and Pray;
as ſome did in <hi>Norwich,</hi> (if I remember the Place) with a Boy that was
ſuppoſed to be Obſeſſed or Poſſeſſed; (Here was Prayer, upon a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition:
For how could they be ſure?) with the Licence of the then B.
of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> And now take heed of Belying your Mother. And I wiſh
(not for any Virtue in a B.'s Licence) for Caution, <hi>Diſſenters</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the B. or ſome others of the Ch. of <hi>Engl.</hi> and adviſed with more
Learned Phyſicians, about this Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 10. You charge me unjuſtly, Mr. T. in ſaying, I would make the
World believe, that you were intimate to <hi>W. C.</hi>'s Intrigue. And tho'
you never ſaw the Man, you might hear of his Hypocritical Carriage at
<hi>Kirkham,</hi> where I ſuppoſe you have ſome Relations. And the things were
not done in Secret, but generally known, and ſpoken of. And I had
heard you were informed of his Tricks, about that Buſineſs; and withal,
that you ſaid you would inform the B. which was honeſt. And it
never entred into my Thought, that you were acceſſary to the Intrigue.
I ſee your Eyes are not yet Cured, Prejudice is powerful.</p>
               <p>Again, I had ſaid, <hi>P.</hi> 18. Lev. <hi>The</hi> B. <hi>of</hi> C. <hi>would never have conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at</hi> W. C. <hi>if he had known ſuch things of him,</hi> &amp;c. much leſs <hi>collated</hi>
him. Here you catch me; for it ſeems he was not Collated. Now I'll
eaſily confeſs my Ignorance and Miſtake: For he being in the Place near
two Years, I thought it rational to believe he was Collated, however
the other word Connived you acknowledge. And if <hi>W. C.</hi> gave any good
Satisfaction, or did any Penance proportionable to his Offences commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
ſo little a while before he went thither, I am glad of it. And being
gone, you ſhall hear no more of him from me, farther than in my own
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47500:14"/>
neceſſary Vindication. But there are ſome Paſſages in your <hi>Lett.</hi> p. 12. you
charge on me, as an Untruth; <hi>viz.</hi> That I would inſinnate a Licence to
another Cure, <hi>viz. N. Chappel;</hi> Mr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> this is your Untruth. I ſaid
he was Introduced, you ſay this is <hi>notoriouſly falſe.</hi> Pray' Sir, what is
falſe? Did he not Preach at <hi>N. Chappel?</hi> and ſome tell me, ſometimes
at <hi>Mancheſter</hi> Church. But ſay you, <hi>Ibid. All that was done, was at the
Importunity of the</hi> Presbyterian <hi>Party.</hi> You here take a Travellers Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
For the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> at <hi>Newton</hi> kept up their diſtinct Meetings
all the time, and ſo did the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Mott</hi> Pariſh, and do ſtill to
this day. And is this like the <hi>Presb.</hi> Party importuning for him or <hi>Grey?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then follows a doleful Story of a Vicar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I can tell you of
another Story, <q>Of one that in a Vicar's Church ſate Weeping, while
the Communion-Office was in hand; to ſee the Symbols of Chriſt's
Body broken, and his Blood ſhed; tho' he muſt not eat of that Bread,
and drink of that Cup, becauſe he durſt not Kneel.</q> And what good
Man had not cauſe to be grieved, when he durſt not adminiſter to ſuch
a Pious Man, as I believe he eſteemed this to be, for fear of Suſpenſion?</p>
               <p>Now I return to your <hi>P.</hi> 18. and I am accuſed of bringing in an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which you ſay is Mine, not Yours. To this, I would not willingly
miſrepreſent what you have written, nor would I miſtake your meaning;
but I ll tell you what led me ſo to underſtand you, and if I be miſtaken,
I'll not perſiſt in it. You, <hi>P.</hi> 32. of <hi>Sur.</hi> Imp. undertook to ſhew two things.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Dugd.</hi> was not poſſeſſed by the Devil.</p>
               <p>2. That if he was, he found no Benefit at all by thoſe erroneouſly
Religious Offices that they performed for him.</p>
               <p>1. To the firſt I expected your Proof, and you go over his Tricks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and at laſt conclude, <hi>P.</hi> 56. <q>I can find nothing in our <hi>Surey</hi>-Spark, from
whence we may conclude him a Demoniack. But then to gratify
Miniſters, I will ſuppoſe he was ſo; and ſhew,</q>
               </p>
               <p>2. <q>That he found no Benefit by their Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> a very bold At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
Now how do you ſhew this? Firſt, you bring in <hi>Dicky</hi> as a
true Prophet, who had ſaid, <q>They were not able to perform what they
had promiſed.</q> Then you bring in <hi>Dugd.</hi> the Father, ſaying, <q>That
after the Miniſters had left him, he had ſeveral Fits. Then <hi>Walmſley</hi> ſays,
Notwithſtanding M. <hi>J. C.</hi> and others Preach'd and Pray'd by <hi>Ri.</hi> his Fits
continued as violent as before, to the laſt Fit.</q> Upon which you make
this Inference, <hi>P.</hi> 57. <q>Doth this look like caſting out the Devil?</q> Now if this be not your Argument to prove your Aſſertion, I find none, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>To prove, That <hi>Dick</hi> found no Benefit by their Prayers.</q> Which was to be
Proved. So you undertake to ſhew, what you either cannot, or will not.</p>
               <p>Again, I had ſaid, What were thoſe Offices which you call <hi>erroneouſly
Religious,</hi> were they Faſting and Prayers? If you exclude Faſting from
being Religious Worſhip, (Erroneouſly there is among the <hi>Errata)
Diſſenters</hi> will not quarrel with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47500:15"/>
To this you have a witty Reflection, <hi>P.</hi> 19. which I'll leave to thoſe that
are diſpoſed to make merry with your Rhetorick: But muſt tell you,
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> are not againſt Faſting, to keep under the Body; nor as a Help
in Religious Worſhip. And methinks this might have paſſed, when many
C. of <hi>E.</hi> will not allow Preaching to be Religious Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Your next Witticiſm is; <q>If it was conceived in a Barn, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayers,
it was the fitteſt Place for them to be begotten in.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Good Sir, is the Worſhip of God any worſe, becauſe in a Barn? Did
not <hi>David</hi> worſhip God acceptably on a Barn-Floor? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 18, 19.
Was not a Stable the firſt place where Chriſt, after his Incarnation, was
worſhipped.</p>
               <p>Again, I am here blamed, for not having Wit to ſtop at a Proverb, but
marr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d it with an Explanation. And indeed here you are in the right;
for if the Explanation had been mine, it had been marr'd.</p>
               <p>But I believe E. <hi>Johnſton</hi> your Publiſher, can aſſure you, (and I wonder
he did not) that preſently after he had received the <hi>Lev.</hi> he had a Note of
<hi>Errata's,</hi> one of which was this; <hi>P. 26. l.</hi> 19. After <hi>Sands,</hi> add <hi>an abſurd
Inference,</hi> vid. <hi>Ray</hi>'s Prov. <hi>p. 195. Ibid. dele</hi> the four next Lines, which
were not in the <hi>M. S.</hi> And who put them there, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>P.</hi> 21. I have a Flirt for ſomething in my <hi>Lett.</hi> P. 27. <hi>That I am blind
as</hi> Tobit. I perceive ſomething pleaſeth not; but you have the Prudence to
paſs it over, and are in haſte, as well as another of your Friends. And for
Dr. <hi>Chew</hi>'s Certificate I need not tarry, for <hi>Dick</hi> never had Fit after the
firſt Doſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you ſay,</hi> P. 22. <hi>I have a</hi> fling <hi>at</hi> the Largeneſs of Dioceſes, <hi>in</hi> Lev.
P. 18. <hi>To this you ſay,</hi> But he would do well to conſider, whether he doth
not by this ſpit in the Face of <hi>Chriſt, (God forbid)</hi> and his Apoſtles;
whoſe Oecumenical Provinces were ſomething larger than the largeſt of
our Dioceſes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> are you here in earneſt? Or you thought to try whether you
could put a Trick upon your ignorant Friend; if this latter, you ſhould
not have <hi>jeſted</hi> at the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when you <hi>bow</hi> at the Name <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if you are in earneſt, to juſtify your large Dioceſes, by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, then you have ſpun a fine Thread for
your ſelf and many of your worthy Brethren. For if B's muſt have as
large Dioceſes as Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as a <hi>H.</hi> 8. would make merry
with a great Revenue of B's Lands, and have ſomething to ſay; One B. in
<hi>England</hi> is enough, and more than needs, when Thirteen will ſerve all the
World. And then you and many of your worthy Brethren are like never
to wear Lawn Sleeves.</p>
               <p>Yet I am not ſo wedded to my own Opinion, but if you can find One to
ſucceed Chriſt in his <hi>Oecumenical Province,</hi> of the ſame <hi>Natures, Gifts,
Wiſdom, Abilities</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> for the Performance of the Function, I
will not ſpit in his Face, but ſubmit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:47500:15"/>
And if you can find 12 Men with the ſame <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> endowed with
the ſame extraordinary <hi>Gifts,</hi> and ſo filled with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of GOD, as
the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> I'll ſubmit, and we'll be Friends ſtill.</p>
               <p>In the ſame, <hi>P.</hi> 22. you are in a Huff; and I obſerve, where I need moſt
of your Help, you are moſt out of Humor.</p>
               <p>I told you, <hi>Lev.</hi> p. 18. I had a Scruple about a Prayer in the <hi>Litany,</hi>
uſed generally in K. <hi>J.</hi>'s time, who was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> viz. <hi>That it may pleaſe
thee to keep and ſtrengthen in the true worſhipping of thee, in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and holineſs of life thy Servant, our moſt gracious K. and Governour.</hi>
And the Reaſon of my Scruple was, becauſe <hi>Popiſh Worſhip</hi> is Idolatrous;
and it ſeemed hard for <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to Pray that he might be kept and
ſtrengthened in <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this you ſay,</hi> Is Popery ſuch a maſs of Idolatry, that there is no piece
of true Worſhip in it? Do they not worſhip God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And was not this
that True Worſhip we prayed God to keep him in?</p>
               <p>Here you are in haſte again, but I muſt tarry by it; for my Scruple is
increaſed, by multiplied Thoughts of ſome Things following.</p>
               <p>1. By the by, I obſerve how tenderly you deal by the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> their
<hi>Worſhip</hi> is true, when <hi>Diſſenters</hi> is erroneouſly Religious Worſhip. But
let that paſs.</p>
               <p>2. I have been told, (but not learned it from Mr. <hi>Frankl.</hi>) that the
<hi>Popiſh Worſhip</hi> is Idolatrous.</p>
               <p>3. I have been told alſo by more than <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that Idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
mixed with ſomething of True Worſhip, doth defile the whole.
And their Liturgy is Idolatrous, as denominated from the worſt Part,
(and perhaps the greateſt) as a Drop of Poiſon in a Cup of Wine.</p>
               <p>4. Doth not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Worſhip by their <hi>Breviary</hi> and <hi>Maſs-Book,</hi>
as the C. of <hi>E.</hi> by their <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> which they call <hi>Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice?</hi>
And is not their <hi>Miſſal</hi> and <hi>Breviary</hi> Idolatrous Worſhip? Tho' in
ſome part of it they pray to God in the Name of Chriſt; tho' it may be,
oftener to Saints and Angels, or to God through their Interceſſion. And
is this a ſufficient Reaſon to juſtify <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Praying to keep them.
and ſtrengthen them in the true worſhipping? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yes, when it's ſafe
for you to drink a Glaſs of Wine with Poiſon in it, becauſe it's but a
Drop; but there is a great deal of Good Wine.</p>
               <p>5. Do you think this of yours, was the Sence of the firſt Compoſers
of this Petition; that it might be Prayed for a <hi>Popiſh</hi> K. or Q?</p>
               <p>6. But here is implied a poſitive Aſſertion, that K. <hi>J.</hi> worſhips God
truly, and not a bare Suppoſition. But if it were but upon Suppoſition,
that you Pray thus for him, then it's Superſtition at the beſt, according
to your own Doctrine.</p>
               <p>7. A <hi>Papiſt</hi> will ſay, If our Worſhipping God be ſuch, that you can
lawfully pray God to keep and ſtrengthen us in it; why did you ſeparate
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47500:16"/>
from our Worſhip? You'll ſay, We ſeparate not, ſo far as it's true. And
ſo will <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſay, We ſeparate not from Ch. of <hi>Engl.</hi> ſo far as their
VVorſhip is good; only from uncommanded Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>8. Did you not mean, when you Prayed for C. II. (beſt of K's ſaid many)
a Proteſtant K. that he might be kept and ſtrengthened in the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Worſhip, or the Common Prayer Worſhip, and not turn from it.
And muſt not the words ſtill have the ſame ſence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But farther you ſay, <hi>Was not thus Praying for him, the beſt means to
reclaim him from his falſe Worſhip?</hi> A means, the beſt means, thus to Pray.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. This might be pretended a means to keep him from turning <hi>Turk</hi>
or <hi>Infidel,</hi> if the Prayer had been, to keep and ſtrengthen him in the
Chriſtian VVorſhip and Religion.</p>
               <p>2. Was not this liker to harden him in his falſe Worſhip? when you at
the ſame time acknowledge his VVorſhipping, without <hi>Ifs</hi> or <hi>Ands,</hi>
to be true, and pray that he may be ſtrengthened in it.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>VVould not this be an odd way to convert</hi> a Papiſt, <hi>by praying thus
with him, and for him?</hi> Lord keep him in the true worſhipping of thee;
<hi>might he not ſay,</hi> I thank you Sir for your good Prayers, for I perceive
I am already in the true Worſhipping of God, and ſo have no need to
change my Church.</p>
               <p>4. But was this the <hi>beſt Means?</hi> verily I think you are not ſo ignorant,
but you can readily think of many better Means. And in my Mind, the
one honeſt <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the C. of <hi>E.</hi> found out a much better Means, when
he changed thoſe words into ſuch as theſe; <hi>That God would direct; and
bring him into, and keep and ſtrengthen him, in the true worſhipping of
him.</hi> In a word, Would it not be a ſtrange hearing, for Men in the <hi>Liturgy</hi>
to Pray for the <hi>Pope,</hi> that God would keep and ſtrengthen him in the
true worſhipping of him; and to ſay this is the beſt means to reclaim
him. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might thus have prayed for <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> for <hi>Ahaz,</hi> &amp;c.
yea, may you not thus pray for the <hi>Turk,</hi> that God would keep and
ſtrengthen him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you ſay he doth not worſhip God truly; yes, may
it be anſwered, he owns the true God, and worſhips him. And this is the
beſt Means to reclaim him from that part of his Worſhip that is falſe.</p>
               <p>The Sum of all is, If Men have but the Conſcience to Subſcribe to
they know not what, that they never read; or may have the liberty to
put their own fancied Meanings upon things commanded, and ſubſcribed
to; they may ſubſcribe to the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and make a ſhift to put a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Sence upon it; (as <hi>S. Clara,</hi> who makes the <hi>Articles</hi> of the C. of <hi>E.</hi>
agree with the <hi>Articles</hi> of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi>) and it ſeems may alſo
lawfully pray for the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Pope;</hi> and ſay to God, <hi>That it may pleaſe
thee to keep and ſtrengthen them in the true worſhipping of thee,</hi> &amp;c. And
according to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> as the beſt means to reclaim them from their falſe
VVorſhip.</p>

Mens <hi>Hearts</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, when you have the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Diſcerning,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had;
you ſhall have my <hi>conſent,</hi> to call Men <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Inſincere,</hi> &amp;c. Provided always you
be not too <hi>haſty,</hi> as ſome of the <hi>Diſciples</hi> were, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 54, 55. and be ſure it be in a
<hi>Good Cauſe,</hi> Gal. 4. 18. and that you have a <hi>Call</hi> to it; leſt ſome of your <hi>Brethren</hi> ſhould
blame you for <hi>arrogating</hi> to <hi>your ſelf,</hi> from <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 10, 13. that which they account the
proper Work of your <hi>Dioceſan.</hi> And if you have a Mind to aſſume the <hi>Authority</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> to call Men <hi>Satan,</hi> (for it ſeems you'll allow <hi>Peter</hi> to have a <hi>Devil,</hi> tho' <hi>Dugd.</hi>
none) It may poſſibly be as good a <hi>warrant</hi> for others to call you a <hi>Devil;</hi> that is, a
<hi>Falſe-Accuſer,</hi> or <hi>Slanderer.</hi> 2. Tim. 3. 3.</p>

               <head type="sub">ANSWER, to P. S.</head>
               <p>I Am now arrived at your <hi>P. S.</hi> and you produce Two <hi>Letters,</hi> to Juſtify the
R. R. the L. B. of C. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> whatever you inſinuate, I have a <hi>tenderneſs</hi> for the <hi>Reputation</hi> of that
worthy Perſon; and therefore when I underſtood that a <hi>Lover</hi> of him had ſent him
<hi>Word, That it was not for his Honour to ſuffer</hi> W. C. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I hoped it might be a ſufficient
<hi>Caution.</hi> And therefore in the <hi>Lev.</hi> I did lay the <hi>Blame</hi> where I think it ſtill lies: <hi>viz.</hi>
On thoſe that ſhould have been more <hi>Faithful</hi> to him; and I am the more confirmed
in my <hi>Opinion,</hi> by theſe very <hi>Letters</hi> you produce, <hi>in Juſtice to the B. and to Mr.</hi> Gray.</p>
               <p>For in the firſt <hi>Lett.</hi> who this <hi>R. T.</hi> is, or who <hi>His Worſhip</hi> is, I am not concerned:
But I ſuppoſe he is not the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party you ſpake of at <hi>P. 11. At whoſe Requeſt,
the</hi> B. <hi>admitted</hi> G. <hi>to the Order of</hi> Deacon.</p>
               <p>But whoever he is, I doubt he is <hi>Partial;</hi> he told the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Gr's</hi> Crime, but did he
tell him of any Satisfaction he had made, for <hi>ſo Publick a Scandal?</hi> Yes, he turned
<hi>Conformiſt,</hi> and all on a Puſh skipped over to the C. of <hi>E.</hi> doubtleſs by immediate <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,</hi>
by the <hi>Hopes</hi> of <hi>better Preferment</hi> than among <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> Is this Satisfaction?</p>
               <p>This <hi>R. T.</hi> reflects on <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and therefore cannot be thought their <hi>Repreſentative</hi>
to the <hi>B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he formerly <hi>Obſerved,</hi> (I perceive he's a Man of Obſervation, and may be an
<hi>Obſervable Man</hi> too) <hi>when ſome weak or debauch'd Miniſter ſerved in the Place, there was but
little Reflection:</hi> A <hi>Debauch'd,</hi> and no <hi>Reflection;</hi> it may be, not by his <hi>Society;</hi> but
there might by <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> ſorrowing and mourning, for what they could not Reform:
Nor when <hi>a weak Miniſter;</hi> truly a weak Miniſter might be Pious and Godly, and
might do his beſt, and then Charity forbad Reflection.</p>
               <p>But now Mr. <hi>Gray,</hi> a very <hi>able Miniſter,</hi> (ſure this is ſome fit Judge) he <hi>was not
reflected at</hi> Thirske; no, they knew nothing of him, but as he appeared to be a <hi>zealous:</hi>
Diſſenter, <hi>'Till he had a Deſign for Mot. and Conformity, And what then?</hi> They reflect on
him, that is, they called to Mind his former Offence, for which he had never teſtified
any Repentance.</p>
               <p>Let's ſee then what the next Letter will do, for this is Small Game? the Letter is
Mr. <hi>Gray'</hi> s own.</p>
               <p>1. But is this fair, to admit a Man to be Witneſs in his own Cauſe? Altho', <hi>Upon
the ſevereſt Examination, as to his Morals,</hi> P. 11. of the <hi>Letter,</hi> Would he Accuſe Himſelf?
This marrs the Proof.</p>
               <p>2. This very <hi>Letter</hi> of his, is a Ground of Suſpicion.</p>
               <p>1. He acknowledges not the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of his <hi>Cenſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:47500:17"/>
2. He calls the <hi>telling</hi> of his <hi>Faults,</hi> Calumnies belched out againſt him.</p>
               <p>3. He ſaith (for ought I know) a manifeſt Untruth; that the <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Ch.</hi> is ſtruck at
for his ſake.</p>
               <p>4. He falſly ſuggeſts the Cauſe of divulging his <hi>Crime:</hi> For was it not divulged
where he was not known before; and how could it be divulg'd where he ſecretly ſculk'd?</p>
               <p>5. He falſly and ſpitefully reflects upon <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> and ſays, he might have lived
quietly, if he had not Conformed.</p>
               <p>1. But did he <hi>Live quietly</hi> when he was a <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> without <hi>Cenſure</hi> for his <hi>Sin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Had they not cauſe to reflect on him, who in ſo long time never ſignified his
<hi>Repentance</hi> to them that Cenſured him.</p>
               <p>6. He charges <hi>Diſſenters</hi> roundly with a Poſition I never heard, nor read; and have
reaſon to ſuſpect his Veracity. However, doth Recriminating Juſtify him?</p>
               <p>7. He ſaith, he fears it's <hi>Malice,</hi> more than <hi>Matter.</hi> What Impudence is this? Is it
<hi>Malice,</hi> who gave thee Authority to Judge Mens Hearts? <hi>More than Matter?</hi> Was
there not a <hi>Cauſe,</hi> was not the <hi>Crime</hi> open, notorious, ſcandalous; and yet no <hi>Matter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Mr. <hi>T.</hi> are theſe things Signs of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and of an humble and broken <hi>Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet after all, if the Man be ſincerely a true <hi>Penitent,</hi> and Live well, and Preach
well, I ſhall ſay, <hi>The Lord give a Bleſſing, and Succeſs to his Labours; for the Converſion
of Sinners, and the Edification of Saints.</hi> So far am I from envying any Pious, Holy
Miniſter, whether of the Ch. of <hi>Engl.</hi> or <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> and very heartily will obey your
<hi>Canon.</hi> Gal. 6. 1.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> you have a ſtrange Comment upon that Text. <hi>I will not,</hi> ſay you,
<hi>reflect upon my Friend,</hi> this is honeſt; <hi>tho' if he be a Man named to me,</hi> (I am confident,
no Man living but my ſelf can be ſure, <hi>who he is you call your Friend,</hi> but your Friend
himſelf; no not the Tranſcriber of the <hi>Levite.) It's ſuppoſed he is as much as the</hi> Scots.

Reluctancy. But out it comes.</p>

                  </gap> I was aſtoniſhed when I read this; a Story came into my Mind, of a <hi>French</hi> B.
taken by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Armour. The <hi>Pope</hi> ſends to the K. of <hi>England,</hi> to releaſe his
Son. Whereupon the K. ſends his Armour to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ordered this Queſtion to
be asked, <hi>Is this thy Son's Coat?</hi> To which the <hi>Pope</hi> anſwered, <hi>He's not my Son, but the
Son of</hi> Mars; and leaves him to the K. to do with him what he pleaſed. I'll refer it to
your <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> to apply it. And for my ſelf, I have need enough of Indulgence of
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Canon, <hi>yet not in</hi> Gray's <hi>Caſe.</hi> I Appeal to the Righteous Judge of all the
World.</p>
               <p>But for you my Friend, if I were your Dioceſan, I would Reprove you ſharply;
but I'll do it in the Spirit of Meekneſs.</p>
               <p>For ought you know, you have one way or other wounded more innocent Perſons,
than <hi>Samſon</hi> did with the Jaw-bone. For there are many Conjectures of the Author of
that which is called <hi>Lanc</hi> Lev. Some ſay it's Sir ſuch a One, and Name, others
a Learned and moderate C. of <hi>E.</hi> Man, others <hi>M. D.</hi> and others a Bookiſh Country
Gentleman; others Father it on no fewer than Five or Six Diſſenting Miniſters, and
name all according to each Man's Fancy So many as theſe are, you have expoſed
them and their Reputation. Beſides, occaſioned the Sin and Cenſures of ſo many,
as believe any of theſe to be the Author; who live, ſome of them 20 Miles diſtant
from one another Now how many may from hence, be filled with Unchriſtian
and Uncharitable Surmiſes of innocent Perſons; eſpecially, ſuch as are willing to
believe any thing that's Ill, of the <hi>Diſſenter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Good Sir, retire, and think what you have done. (For I profeſs, I never heard
the leaſt Charge of this nature, againſt any that are reputed Authors, and as I
know my ſelf, Innocent; to I believe are all the reſt.) And read the Author of
