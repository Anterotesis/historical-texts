            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Nor could Policie direct me better then to borrow your Name; for if there be no other worth in the Treatiſe, yet, it will both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, and ſomewhat recompence the Reader to ſee ſo fair and ſtately a Frontiſpiece as your Honours Name place't before it: at leaſt, they muſt like it much the better, and think it the more deſerving for bearing ſo great a Sail.</p>
            <p>And though I cannot, without huge Arrogancy pretend it to be a Preſent ſutable to your Greatneſs and Deſerts; yet it may paſs for an acknowledgement of that high opinion, or rather certain knowledge, I have of your Vertues and Merits.</p>
            <p>I have many other reaſons to alledge in defence of the <hi>Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as, your <hi>Lordſhips Power</hi> and <hi>Abilities</hi> to promote and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to practiſe, what others only can <hi>adviſe, diſcourſe, think</hi> on, and <hi>wiſh</hi> for.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot only my own Reſentments; but the deſires of divers Deſerving Perſons, and Eminent Citizens have obliged me to proffer the ſubſequent Diſcourſe to your Grave and Solemn conſiderations; leaſt, (as to Phyſical and Natural Cauſes) the defect of a Praemunition, and Polemick Praecaution; <hi>the next Summer</hi> prove as <hi>formidable</hi> if not <hi>fatal</hi> as this <note n="*" place="margin">If your Honours pleaſe to peruſe the firſt Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of the fifth and the beginning of the ſixth page of this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treatiſe, you will find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</note>.</p>
            <p>In complyance with your neceſſary Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and weighty Imployments, I have reſolv'd againſt Prolixity; and to keep within the Circle, as much as the lines of its account will permit, and ſhall only therefore, as it were, <hi>prime</hi> the Cloth, and ſtrain the <hi>Canvis,</hi> that I may chalk out a <hi>Deſign,</hi> intending ſome ſuch able Maſters
<pb facs="tcp:41384:4"/>
as your ſelves to finiſh and put life to it.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of this Contagion, I had (in favour of the incloſed Paper) the Honour to wait upon the Committee appointed for this Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I then in perſon made a proffer, and Tranſient Diſcourſe on what I now more deliberately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in Paper: But the misfortune then was, (and will be till a way be found out to Retrive the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) that their Power was <hi>Limited,</hi> and they muſt proceed <hi>Legally,</hi> and by that means they could not take farther cognizance of the caſe.</p>
            <p>I was thereby juſtly ſilenc't, and ſaw no reaſon then to do in Perſon, what I now ſubmiſſively hope I may in Paper; it being as ſignificant in a time of Death and Sickneſs to caſt about for life and health, as in a time of Peace to make proviſion for War.</p>
            <p>To come (my Lord) now a little nearer the buſineſs I aim at, and that is in the behalf of many deſerving Citizens who are herein ſupplicants to your Lordſhip; That you would at the next Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Sitting of Parliament, move their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to take into their Conſiderations the Penal Statute, <hi>Primo Jacobi</hi> 31. <hi>concerning ſhutting up Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited and Infected houſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unleſs my Author miſ-informs me, it
<pb facs="tcp:41384:4"/>
was then debated, <q>Whether ſuch <hi>Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or <hi>Removing</hi> the Sick and Well, into <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral</hi> and diſtinct places, and <hi>Out-parts</hi> of the City, (as the Artillery-Ground by <hi>Fins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,</hi> &amp;c.) were moſt expedient?</q> But the ſtate and exigencies of affairs then inclin'd them, (though with ſome Reluctancy) to determine the <hi>former</hi> under the <hi>Penalty of death,</hi> and being proceeded againſt according to the Statute againſt Vagabonds made the 39. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty, our Royal Soveraign, in Chriſtian care and indulgence of his People at the beginning of this Infection alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the Lords of his Privie-Council a Committee for Inſpection, into what was moſt expedient and proper, for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſpreading and increaſe of this Plague: Their Lordſhips accordingly required the Honorable and Learned Colledge of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to <q>
                  <hi>Add, alter,</hi> and ordain as they ſhould find the preſent times and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to require:</q> But ſtill with this Reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>viz. In purſuance of former Preſidents in the Reign,</hi> &amp;c. or elſe, ſurely it would have been thought on as a thing moſt eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
<pb facs="tcp:41384:5"/>
to have caus'd a Separation of the Well and Sick, (which cannot but be acknowledg'd as neceſſary as water to quench fire) but yet by ſuch proper aids and helps as might beſt anſwer its end and Intention.</p>
            <p>And indeed (to ſpeak candidly) it ſeems to me, as if the Colledge had ſome ſuch thoughts in reſerve, and in complyance with the Act, went as far as their line would let them, the words in their Sixth Section being theſe—That upon the diſcovery of the Infection in any houſe, there be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently means uſed to preſerve the whole; or, if the whole be to be removed; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to be given to the Dverleers of their Remove, that care may be taken they ſhall not wander until they be ſound.</p>
            <p>That by the whole is meant that part, or ſuch perſons as remained whole and well in Sick-houſes, is evident by the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi>—if the whole be to be removed: but I leave that Honourable and Learned Society to be their own Commentators, as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall require: Errors in this nature, by the <hi>Wiſe mans words,</hi> being as ſtones caſt upon the waters; <gap reason="foreign">

up another until the latter is bigger then the former.</p>
            <p>However, as to my ſelf (others as yet keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſilence) ſo far as my reaſon can inſure me any thing, I cannot but think, that the <hi>medium</hi> 'twixt the two <hi>extreams</hi> of letting all infected perſons looſe, <hi>or</hi> * the ſhutting up all well perſons with the infected, would be the only expedient to preſerve the whole: the one when things grow to extremity, though never ſo much endeavoured, cannot be obſerved, nor the other prevented or avoided: neither can I by all that I have as yet heard in favour of the * latter, perſwade my ſelf but that it is as well as the former, rather a great promoter then preventer of the Plague: the Mortality being hereby greatly increaſed, and after ſuch hard and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere uſuage, thoſe that are left alive, having done their penance, and thereby abſolved and releaſed, become far more Infectious (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>Longer,</hi> the <hi>Leſſer</hi> they are tainted) then if they had been never been ſo ſhut up, or reſtrained. Neither is it any abſurd Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That the greateſt Plagues that ever were in <hi>England,</hi> were when it firſt was Inſtituted, and moſt obſerved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41384:6"/>
Something diſſonant to this, <hi>An.</hi> 36. in as formidable a Plague in its beginning as ours, was with good ſucceſs conſtituted by his late Sacred Majeſty of ever bleſſed memory <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt: and I have by ſome perſons of good Quality, now alive, then Viſited, and ſo diſpoſed of, been informed that not one of Twenty among the well perſons ſo removed fell ſick, nor one in Ten of the ſick died; which next to Gods Goodneſs they imputed to their freedom of Airing, Walking, Recreating, and refreſhing of themſelves by an honeſt and free Converſation one with another: hereby alſo they had the voluntary, free and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Viſits of the beſt and moſt able Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Chirurgeons, and Apothecaries, little hazard by this means attending their Cures: the dejection, horror, fear, and conſternation of their Spirits (great Incendiaries and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of a Peſt) were hereby alſo taken off, and much abated: Searchers, Bearers, Nurſes, and other licenſed Viſitors (whoſe walks are far more perillous then divers that are occluded and ſhut up) would hereby alſo become almoſt void and uſeleſs.</p>

                  </gap>ick</hi> parts of Phyſick relating to it, were like reading Lectures of Martial Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline to a Souldier, when he ſhould fight, ſtand upon his guard, and be on ſervice: or teach the Art of <hi>Navigation</hi> in a ſtorm and ſhipwrack; whereas the <hi>Maxmium urgens</hi> and only thing then to be thought on, is, how to eſcape drowning, and throw over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board all things of leſs concernment then themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41384:8"/>
To this end, I have avoided all the parts of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, unleſs the Hygeiaſtick; alſo all that concerns that but the Firſt of the Six <hi>Non-Naturals,</hi> viz. <hi>Air:</hi> it being (in ſubmiſſion to better Judgments) the <hi>Unum Neceſſarium,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>One</hi> of the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarieſt things that concern the Subject I referr all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>viz.</hi> the Preſervation of ſuch as are Returning, or are Returned out of a good, ſound, wholſom and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Air, into one that is vitiated, infirm, crazy and ſickly.</p>
            <p>As Meat and Drink is to the Body, ſo is Air to the Spirits; which are weakned and corrupted, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and ſupported, as much by a good or bad Air, as our Bodies by good or bad Diet: And hence it is, that all Phyſitians and Philoſophers in all ages, have in their Inſtitutions made as great proviſion for Air as Aliment, it being of as great force and power to alter our Bodies, as the very food we eat, in regard it communicates its qualities to the Spirits, and by the Spirits to all the parts of our Bodies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Phyſitians have in this Infection, been all along ſo important for the uſe of all ſuch rational helps as might cleanſe and rectifie the Air: as among many others, the making of large fires in every ſtreet; which had it been rightly managed, was as brave and as effectual an expedient for the ridding <hi>(quantum res humanae patiuntur)</hi> the City from this Infection, as ever was, or will be thought on; and if over God ſhould give the City the like deplored occaſion; if then inſtead of making Fires as formerly <hi>within</hi> the City, they were but to be made <hi>without</hi> it, (I mean the Suburbs alſo) and at the ſame time ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care be taken, that none but Infected perſons might
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41384:8"/>
come near thoſe fires; I do aſſure my ſelf (as to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſes) it would anſwer its deſired effect.</p>
            <p>If this may ſeem too troubleſome and chargeable, there is another way near allyed to it to be thought on, that hath very little of charge or trouble atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it; and that is to make at the four Quarters of the City, four vaſt huge fires of Coal, in ſome ſuch fit and apt place as <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> or <hi>Smith-Field,</hi> &amp;c. and to let them be kept burning fiercely, and clear from ſmoak (it being though a ſulphurous body of little or rather no worth in the caſe) for three or four dayes and nights. This being done every 12 or 24 hours at fartheſt, ought to be made near the ſaid Coal Fires, (which are ſtill to be kept burning) a large and brisk Wood-fire for an hour or two, of ſome light bruſhie and flamable ſubſtance, as Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings, Tarr-barrels and the like; and to exalt its flame, 'tis neceſſary to throw in now and then, Salt-P<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eter, Oil, or a bag of Gunpowder ſo big as may ſafely be permitted.</p>
            <p>The reaſons of this preceding Paragraph is this: Fires and all hot bodies are very powerful attracters and drawers, and by this property it hath, the Infection will be drawn from the Center to the Circumference, as well as from the Circumference to the Center, as is apparent by the Cities being <hi>more,</hi> and the Suburbs <hi>leſs</hi> infected ſince this late unlucky experiment was made upon it. The ground of which I am apt to think was from former miſtaken Preſidents, or, the Obſervation of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s ridding the City of <hi>Athens</hi> in his time from that Contagion by Fires; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering whether they were plac't <hi>within</hi> or <hi>without</hi> its Walls. <hi>In</hi> and <hi>out,</hi> though but little words, yet of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41384:9"/>
ſuch great and vaſt import in the caſe that they are like <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I never yet by any principle of Philoſophy could underſtand that <hi>cold</hi> was any cauſe of Contagion: an Intemperies of <hi>heat, moiſture,</hi> or <hi>dryneſs,</hi> may; and if <hi>this</hi> Infection muſt proceed <hi>(quo ad hominem)</hi> from a Dyſcracy of ſome of thoſe three firſt Qualities, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Dryneſs (as upon good grounds I am apt to think it doth) it will be hard then to find out, how <hi>fire</hi> that aſſiſts it in its Cauſes ſhould eaſe or help it in its Effects.</p>
            <p>We may ſafely conclude, whatever relief Fires can afford in the caſe, is, as 'tis an Element, and not from any Temperament, or Quality belonging to it: 'Tis its flame doth good; its heat without flame doth hurt; the one by ſomewhat attracting and philtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what it attracts; the other more powerfully attracting, and not at all rarifying what it hath attracted.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I have purpoſely inſerted for all perſons indefinitely to conſider of, becauſe I would not willingly have a buſineſs of this conſequence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now, or hereafter neglected, or miſimproved; <hi>Oportet enim medicum eſſe Polyperiſtaticum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to thoſe familiar and neceſſary Cautions and Directions I intend, one of which is</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>(1.)</head>
               <p>That all perſons would be as careful <hi>at</hi> and <hi>after</hi> their return, and coming in, as they were prudent in their leaving and going out of the City, the danger as to them being ſtill the ſame, or greater: for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41384:9"/>
though the Contagion be not, (God only be praiſed for it) ſo mortal to thoſe Inhabitants that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in it, and have been uſed to it, (Cuſtom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting another Conſtitution in them) yet the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of it are of ſuch vaſt concernment to ſuch as have been uſed to a better and more benign Air, that they ought ſtill to continue their care in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the Caſualties that may attend a raſh run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into and an unadviſed living in, ſuch a rotten, putrid and infected Air, as <hi>London,</hi> without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, now is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was ſo great an Enemy to all ſudden changes and violent mutations, that he would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it in things hurtful and prejudicial to Nature, where time and cuſtom had gained ſo upon us as to make them familiar to us; and if a gradation is to be obſerved in paſſing from things bad and hurtful to things good and beneficial, much more ought it to be done <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>gradatìm,</hi> and by piece-meals when the mutation is from things beneficial in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, (as good Air) to things bad and Inimical.</p>
               <p>But the ſame reaſons beſides this that did oblige per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to leave <hi>London,</hi> will ſerve with the addition of many more, to be as circumſpect and cautious of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it: as, the great increaſe of dead Corps ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially buried, which undoubtedly, but that the Sun hath and will abate more and more of its power and energy in cauſing Exhalations, would produce elſe a greater Mortality then any yet hath been, from any precedent cauſes of Contagion and Putrefaction: And it highly concerns every reſpective Pariſh to raiſe their Church-yards with freſh Earth and new Mold, leaſt the <hi>next Summer</hi> prove more fatal then
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41384:10"/>
this. Some have reported, that Dogs have paw'd and ſcrap't up Graves, and preyed upon the dead bodies careleſly and undecently buried, and not long after diſgorged fingers, eyes, noſes and ears, as the Effects of their venemous Surfeits, and whole families have been ſwept away by the poyſon and malignity of it.</p>
               <p>To this end it is abſolutely neceſſary for all ſuch as are to Return out of the Countries, before they come ſo near <hi>London</hi> as to breathe in it, or take any part or portion of its infected breath, ſtrictly and carefully to obſerve for their Preſervation the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection mentioned in the next Section, or Caution, and in the laſt ſheet of this Treatiſe. And that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may have timely notice thereof, it is left to the care of ſuch as are now in <hi>London,</hi> and have their friends abroad.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>The ſecond Caution.</head>
               <p>That thoſe that come out of a ſerene, pure, whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and ſound Air, would procure ſome ſound, wholeſom and well perſon that hath been converſant and uſed to <hi>London,</hi> to enter firſt their Houſes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were or were not viſited: Infection like Air, being of a very inſinuating, ſubtil and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature, and may poſſibly have crept out of the windows, ſinks and paſſages of neighbouring houſes, and adjacent places, and lie lurking all the while in their own beds, houſes, garments, and hangings.</p>
               <p>This caution I thought, totally to have omitted, for fear of poſſeſſing people with dread and timorous fancies; but when I ſeriouſly conſidered, how many
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41384:10"/>
have, and may miſcarry by Preſumption and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and how eaſily they might ſecure themſelves <hi>(favente Deo)</hi> from all fear and danger in the caſe, I reſolved to let it go as 'tis.</p>
               <p>And that which I adviſe all perſons to do, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conveniently procure others to do it for them, is to enter then the houſes themſelves with a Link well lighted; (every one that goes in at firſt to take one in their hand) and to carry it juſt before them, no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then their mouth and noſthrils: the flame by this means ſuppreſſeth and diſperſeth the Air, and keeps off the malignacy (if there ſhould be any) from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring their bodies; and by this means, I, or any man that hath a lawful call to it, might ſafely enter any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected or Viſited Houſe.</p>
               <p>This being done, (ſtill keeping the Links burning) let them make in every room good fires, eſpecially thoſe they intend to lie in, ſmoaking them well with Cloves, Cinamon, Benjamin, Storax, Cypreſs, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, or Juniper Wood: But the following Paſtil may ſupply the defect of all domeſtick fumes upon all occaſions whatever; neither is there yet any thing as yet thought on, more neceſſary and uſeful.</p>
               <p>Next, let them air well their beds, whether they were, or were not infected, with ſuch things as are of a drying, mundifying, attenuating and clenſing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and withal, let them be appropriated to the Head, Heart, and Lungs. To this end at Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon</hi> at the Peſtle and Mortar in <hi>Finch-Lane</hi> over againſt the <hi>French</hi> Church, and Mr. <hi>Reeds,</hi> at the Queens Arms in <hi>Fan-Church-Street,</hi> I have appointed a <hi>Paſtill,</hi> which is to be light at the ſmall end, with a Candle, and to be placed in an
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41384:11"/>
earthen Porringer, ſet under the Bed, (the mattereſs being taken off) that the fume may the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate it ſelf into the Bed, all the while they are making, ſtirring, and throwing of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Rotulae Peſtilentiales</hi> or <hi>Paſtils,</hi> being often thus uſed as a fume for Beds, will be found not only beneficial, but convenient, in regard being lighted at one end, they burn like a match without any flame, which may prove hazardous under Beds.</p>
               <p>They do not only correct the malignacy of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Air, but alſo refreſh the Vital and Animal Spirits, and is of great uſe for Conſumptive, Dropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Aſtmatick perſons, and ſuch as are troubled with Catarrhs and Defluctions upon their Lungs, being uſed not only as above directed, but alſo to fume their night-Linnen when they go to bed.</p>
               <p>I cannot alſo but highly commend the uſe of them in Churches, not only upon this occaſion, but at all times hereafter; and was it but once grown formal and cuſtomary (as an Hour-Glaſs,) it would (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe) be contended for in future ages, for more than a ceremony and nicety in Phyſick.</p>
               <p>It is alſo at all times an excellent expedient in Courts of Judicature: alſo for Shop-keepers to keep them conſtantly burning by them, it would be found a very acceptable and rational Preſervative; and in all places of common reſort, where the corrupt, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid and tainted breaths of infirm and ſickly perſons, doth in proceſs of time Intaminate others; which ſome do impute our frequent Conſumptions in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> very much unto.</p>
               <p>Perſons of worth and quality, when they have tryed them, and know the uſe and benefit of them,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41384:11"/>
I ſuppoſe, will keep to them, and therefore I have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them at very reaſonable rates to be always in a readineſs, that all people may be the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to uſe them. Thoſe that are ſo extream poor, that they cannot go to the price of theſe, cannot (for Infected Beds only) do better then put a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or two of Salt-Petre amongſt five or ſix ſpoonfuls of Brimſtone to be uſed as aforeſaid. Gunpowder alſo moiſtned with Vinegar, if it could be ſafely uſed, is good.</p>
               <p>This being done, they may ſecurely, (having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly called upon God for protection) go into their Peds, eating (the laſt thing they take) one or two of the Lozanges hereafter mentioned: if they rub the inſide of the Noſtrils alſo with a little <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcordium,</hi> it will be the better. And in the morning having thankfully worſhipped their Maker, <hi>(à quo omnis ſalus &amp; medicina)</hi> let them uſe ſome of the Preventives hereafter mentioned.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
               <head>The third Caution.</head>
               <p>That People would be very careful and cautious with whom they converſe and deal, not only becauſe for ſome conſiderable time, Infected perſons will be frequent in all places with their running Sores, and venemous breaths, but becauſe alſo the Goods, Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, Apparel, and Houſholdſtuff of ſuch perſons as are deceaſed, and places that have been infected, do uſually retain the Infection for five or ſix months, or more, eſpecially Bedding, Linnen and Woollen. <hi>Oxford</hi> was in former Sickneſſes twice infected by Commodities carried thither from <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41384:12"/>
Thoſe that will not allow this for an undeniable truth, may inform themſelves better, by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored inſtances too tedious to be here inſerted; but above all, 'tis remarkable, as upon ſtrict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry hath been by ſome obſerved, that the firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion excepting Sin) of this Peſt in and about <hi>London,</hi> was by a parcel of Skins brought out of <hi>Holland</hi> into St. <hi>Giles,</hi> which by the contiguity and ſucceſſion of ſecond Cauſes mediate and immediate, hath been propagated to this extremity: neither is there any ſuch Authentick Demonſtration. that it is ſo much generated by Celeſtial Influences, as propagated by Infection <hi>taken</hi> and <hi>given,</hi> as is the Itch, Pox, and Small-Pox amongſt Men and Children, the Rot and Murrain amongſt Cattle; and as in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitals, Priſons and common Gaols Diſeaſes are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten generated, continued and augmented; juſt ſo by the ſteams and breath of dying and infected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, unadviſed community with Nurſes, Bearers, and Searchers, &amp;c. the <hi>fomes</hi> of this Plague hath been held up and increaſed: And that groſs miſtake the vulgar made in promiſcuous community one with another, from the obſervation of the Plagues abatement in 65. hath occaſioned without doubt the deſtruction of many Thouſand perſons; and had not an immediate Hand of Mercy from Heaven ſtopt the Execution of us, it would ſurely have run on to our utter ruine.</p>
               <p>If it be here asked, Why then were not all perſons equally ſurpized with the Peſtilence, that breathed in the ſame Air, and converſed daily with ſick peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, received their breaths, attended their Cure, and dreſt their Soars, as Phyſitians, Chirurgeons, &amp;c?
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41384:12"/>
It may be anſwered, becauſe all men had not the like Conſtitutions, and therefore ſuffered not the ſame effects: ſuppoſe for demonſtration, <hi>(ſic magna cum parvis)</hi> mans body to be like Tinder, but ſome more diſpos'd to take fire then others; ſometimes the Flint, ſometimes the Steel, ſometimes the Tinder it ſelf, either too dry, or too moiſt, is the cauſe that twenty blows will not, when at another time a touch will ſerve to ſet all on fire: So, ſometimes mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with a thought, a look, a word, or ſad ſtory, ſhall quickly be overcome and vanquiſht; whereas others like wet Tinder, ſhall not take withal the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies and Caſualties that do attend them: So that one great cauſe (beſides Gods Providence) is the various accidents, diſpoſitions, forms, tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, cuſtoms and inclinations of mens mindes and bodies; or elſe, all as well as one, that were wet at the ſame time in a ſhowr of rain ſhould take cold, fall ſick, and die: all that were debaucht with Wine, ſhould fall into Feavers, and have one and the ſame diſeaſe, which upon the former and divers others conſiderations we ſee dayly to the contrary. <hi>Multa enim conveniunt morbo, quae non conveniunt Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There might be many more Cautions and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions added; but I intend no more then what are familiar, practical and neceſſary. Beſides the chief bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs I aim at, is the <hi>Preſervatory</hi> part, which as it conſiſts in avoiding thoſe things
<list>
                     <item>1. That occaſion Infection;</item>
                     <item>So,</item>

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41384:13"/>
The former we have done with, and take it for granted, as it is agreed on all hands, that corrupt Air, whether from Coeleſtial, or Terreſtrial Cauſes, being drawn into the body, is one principal cauſe of Infection, eſpecially in Peſtilential times: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Diſcourſe is intended for People returning, and already returned out of a good Air into a bad, I ſhall only inſiſt upon ſome farther means and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies as relates to the correcting Air infected, and the preſerving <hi>(quo ad nos)</hi> both by inward and outward means, Perſons from Infection.</p>
               <p>To the firſt ſort, as general and more common, doth belong the ringing of Bells, firing and letting off great Guns: Fires and Bon-fires made ſeverally both with Wood and Coal, as before directed; the cutting open the Pipes in great Streets for the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of clean and freſh Water: Allies, narrow Streets and Lanes, to be kept ſweet and clean, and free from the annoyance of Dunghils, Jakes, and other naſtery; the carkaſſes of Dogs, Cats and other Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion to be deep buried, and not to lye rotting and poyſoning the Air. Where the Air is thus corrupted, we commonly ſee people there die in greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: and where theſe greivances are not, nor can be reformed, 'tis good to ſtay within doors as much as poſſible may be, and to ſmoke the Houſe well with Roſin, Tarre, Turpentine, and other materials directed in the Colledge Books, good large fires alſo in infected houſes, rather then in thoſe that are free, would be very advantageous to neighbours that dwell next to them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, leave no Window open to the South, to the North you may, in quiet, pleaſant and clear dayes;

but keep them all conſtantly cloſe ſhut after the Sun is down, in regard they only then draw (like Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes) bad air into the rooms unto which they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long: neither go out too ſoon in a morning, eſpecially faſting, or ſome Preventive taken (of which hereafter) nor be abroad too late at night, not only becauſe the Sun then hath drawn off its beneficence and bleſſing from the Earth, but becauſe people will make moſt bold then to be throwing out of doors and windows whatever infectious and noiſom things incumber their houſes.</p>
               <p>Thus far for Generals, and things more common againſt infected Air; next are things more peculiar and ſpecial, both inward and outward; of which ſort are <hi>Antidotes, Iſſues, Amulets,</hi> and <hi>Odoraments,</hi> under which are comprehended <hi>Balls, Boxes, Noſegaies, Pomanders,</hi> and all manner of <hi>Naſals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe we will reſerve till the laſt; and as for <hi>Iſsues,</hi> they are, without controverſie, of great value and worth, and inferiour to no Topical appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation whatever. If I ſhould write all that they may juſtly challenge, there would be no end of their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; and I have, and do adviſe all my friends, Old and Young, Fat and Lean, Weak and Strong, without any exception to uſe them, this being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Amulets</hi> have not as yet gained that univerſal and uncontrolled repute in the World. <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, as <hi>Deleteries</hi> they are inimical to Nature, eſpecially if the party that wears them be given to much labour, exerciſe, or motion; neither can I adviſe ſuch, if <hi>any,</hi> with hope of good ſucceſs to uſe them: but ſuppoſe they be made of <hi>Alexeteries,</hi> then <hi>Galen</hi> nor any ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious

perſon, doth, or ever did diſpute or queſtion them. And thoſe that have written and argued (not without cauſe) againſt Deleterious and poyſonous <hi>Amulets,</hi> made of Toads, Arſenick, Quickſilver, &amp;c. yet do they highly allow of ſuch as are Alexiterical and Cardiack. And ſuch as ſhall deny their ſafe and effectual operation, with this diſtinction, deny for want of better underſtanding, a manifeſt truth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered, is the vulgar uſe of Balls, Boxes, Noſegaies, Pomanders, &amp;c. which (to ſpeak impartially (and as I ſuppoſe moſt peoples experience by this time may tell them) are poor, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, foppiſh, and impertinent things, the very form, manner, and <hi>moderum</hi> of them being inſignificant; people having them to ſeek and grope for when the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion may be at hand, or while it is paſt: all perſons are not, nor indeed can any be ſo compleatly wiſe, as to know the <gap reason="foreign">

The greateſt conſideration and proviſion <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>that can be made will be little enough to avoid the occaſions of infection which may ſurprize you <hi>inſtanti,</hi> in a moment, the twinckling of an eye, ere you can ſay, <hi>What's this?</hi> and therefore there cannot be too much done to keep the paſſages at which the Enemy muſt enter to take us. And of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:41384:14"/>
and outward helps, there is none extant as yet, or ever will be thought on, more effectual (in ſtead of Balls, Boxes, and Noſegaies, &amp;c.) than the rubbing the inſide of the Noſtrills with a little <hi>Venice Treacle, Mithridate,</hi> but above all <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> as being more agreeable to the Tone and temperature of the brain: or take a piece of Sponge (or Wool) cut it fit for the occaſion, dip it in <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and ſmear it with <hi>Venice</hi> or <hi>Common Turpentine,</hi> that it may ſtick, and put it up the Noſtrills. And I do ſolemnly adviſe all perſons that have any reſpect to their health and ſafety, when they come within a mile or two of <hi>London,</hi> to keep conſtantly a Lozange in their mouth, (how to uſe them is hereafter directed) and to put up into their Noſtrills ſome <hi>Diaſcordium</hi> (if a little <hi>Bole Armenack</hi> be mixt with it, 'tis the better) The Mouth and Noſtrils being ſecured, you are as ſafe as Natural helps can make you, theſe being the two paſſages at which Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction muſt enter.</p>
               <p>Continue doing this for three or four weeks at leaſt; longer is neceſſary, but people grow weary of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing: by this means there will be little or no danger in your coming to, and living in the City. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made this proviſion, I can confidently adviſe all perſons, <hi>Cito &amp; Tuto,</hi> ſpeedily and ſafely according as their lawful and neceſſary affairs ſhall permit, to return to their former habitations.</p>
               <p>But here a grand Query and Objection of the Times is to be taken notice of, and that is, <hi>Whether ſweet or foetid ſcents are beſt againſt Infection?</hi> That which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions the ſcruple by all that I can obſerve, is a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that ſweet ſcents attract and draw, and ſtinks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and drive back; whereas the contrary may be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41384:15"/>
thought rather the truth. This the ſurmiſing Vulgar are very prone to call in queſtion, from that common miſtaken experiment they take from <hi>Hyſterick</hi> diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; where they ſay ſweet ſmells draw up the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, and ſtinks drive it down; and ſo taking <hi>non cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa pro cauſa,</hi> the Controverſie is occaſioned. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Hyſterical</hi> vapours aſcent nor deſcent is ſimply from the odoriferous or foetid fume, but becauſe its (..) Receptacle being delighted and pleaſed with delicious and grateful odours, and as much offended by noiſome and unpleaſant ſavours, it greedily riſeth up (though in its own wrong) to enjoy the one, and as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily flies as an Enemy the other; which is as great a proof as any need be produced, of natures deteſting and abhorring, as prejudicial and hurtful to it ſelf, all foetid, ſtinking, and unſavoury ſcents, and that is the common and received opinion of Phyſitians. Though I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think that the heart (the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vital ſpirits) by its <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> is the efficient and material cauſe of thoſe vapours aſſention and declination: the heart by the heat of the Arterial blood, dilates, lifts up, and moves the lungs, by which motion they attract Air, and ſuck in ſuch thin, ſubtil, and aereal bodies, as ſcents and odours; which being communicated by the lungs to the heart, the heart (as in a Throne) by its Prerogative Royal, and Legiſlative Power, acts <hi>Rex,</hi> and truly examines and determines, approves and diſallows whatever is <hi>Homogeneal</hi> and <hi>Heterogeneal</hi> to it ſelf; and when it apprehends any inimical blood, ſcent, or vapour, contained and lodged in (its Kingdom) the Body, to approach its preſence by the communication of inferiour parts, it ſpeedily throws off, and expells it by the coercive power of its
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41384:15"/>
                  <hi>Syſtole:</hi> for as is the motion of the Heart and Arteries, ſo is the Venal blood, Vapour, and Natural Spirit, which are fluxil parts, and in any part of the body: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it more abſurd for perfect and imperfect blood to be mingled in this motion, then for the excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious humours to be mingled with the pure Alimentary blood: and as the muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> and the <hi>Periſtatick</hi> motion of the Inteſtines expel the foeces, ſo the Heart by its tranſverſe Fibres, labours to expel ſuch homonymous blood, ſpirits, and noxious vapours, as are proffered to it, or may aſſault it in Circulation, or by the communication of parts.</p>
               <p>But this I leave as too Problematical and difficult to be made evident by a Tranſient diſcourſe: and that the Queſtion may not render the practice dubious or inſecure, I ſhall have recourſe to Authority <hi>(diſcentem enim credere oportet)</hi> and reſolve all into the opinion and judgement of the moſt able and learnedſt Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who unanimouſly agree that fragrant, ſweet, and pleaſant fumes, and odoriferious exhalations tend much to the prolongation of life, and prevention of very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great diſeaſes and infirmities.</p>
               <p>The Jewiſh Doctours, if credible Hiſtorians are to be believed, uſed them frequently in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and the Primitive Chriſtians in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; however, did they, or did they not, yet ſo far as the reaſonableneſs of an act and cuſtom, or Phyſical uſe may oblige, I think there is not a more neceſſary and uſeful thing to be thought on. And though I will not be ſo arrogant <hi>(nè agyrtarum vocibus uti videar)</hi> as to pronounce this Paſtil or Fume I have appointed to be the only, and moſt abſolute that can be thought on or produc'd, yet I may boldly ſay, that I never ſaw, or

               <p>What an influence they have upon the principal parts of life, might (did I intend a Volume) be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated by their great and manifeſt effects, <hi>per nates &amp; fauces,</hi> in the cure of Conſumptions, and moſt diſtempers incident to the Brain and Lungs; but I am mindful of my intended brevity, and ſhall only

adviſe all ſuch as are troubled with bad Lungs, or would ſecure themſelves from ſuch diſtempers to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves as much as may be to the uſe of theſe or ſuch like ſpecifick odours, not only now, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; the Lungs, Vital, Animal, and Natural Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being much injured, and Conſumptions much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the noiſom ſmells as are at the beſt of times in ſuch populous places as this City.</p>
               <p>Thus far for outward Helps and Applications; the next thing to be conſidered and treated on, is, <hi>Inward Antidotes:</hi> and they conſiſt of ſuch things as do reſiſt Malignancie, and ſtrengthen the Heart and Vital parts inwardly, as the other things we have ſpoken of, do the animal and natural faculties outwardly. This vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vapour which breedeth the Peſtilence, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed together with the air or breath firſt to the Lungs, then to the heart; from thence it is diſperſed by the Veins and Arteries into all parts of the body. And firſt it ſurpriſeth the Spirits, next the Humours, and at length <hi>tota ſubſtantia,</hi> and firm ſubſtance of the body; and then commonly within three or four dayes it grows to extremity. Now the beſt armour againſt this Enemy, that I know of in all Art and Nature, for outward means, is what I have already adviſed; and for inward helps they are almoſt infinite, ſome are for one thing, ſome for another: never was more variety to cure Corns and the Tooth-ach, ſo that I may ſay with the Poet,

However, to make good and ſhort work of it, I ſhall give you a practical draught of what I do my ſelf, and adviſe my beſt Relations and Friends unto. And firſt and above all things, when I awake in the morn.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41384:17"/>
I humbly worſhip, and devoutly thank God for preſerving me the night paſt; then I frequently gargle my throat, waſh my Mouth, Hands Noſtrils, Temples, Ears, and fore-head with Vinegar and Water; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if <hi>Nutmegs, Orris, Angelica, Ruc, Roſemary, Balm, Lavender, Mint, Maſterwort, Sage, Setival, Zedoary, Orange Pill,</hi> theſe or any of theſe are kept continually ſteept for uſe, 'tis the better.</p>
               <p>When in my Chamber and about the houſe, I burn the Paſtil or Fume before mentioned. When I go abroad, outwardly I uſe <hi>Diaſcordium</hi> to my Noſtrils, and inwardly I take two or three Lozanges, letting them diſſolve in my mouth, and ſo ſwallow them as they melt, which by fixing humours, and contracting the orifice of the ſtomach, and paſſages that lead to it, hinder thereby malignant air from entring into the inward parts, and wonderfully ſtrengthen the heart to reſiſt ſudden death. They are neceſſary upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for all perſons at all times and places, but chiefly in Churches, and all places of publick reſort. This Lozange I have given an accompt of in a former prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted paper, and it hath been uſed with as much ſucceſs as any one Remedy about <hi>London,</hi> all along this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: in the main I own <hi>Galen</hi> to be the Author of it, who with little variation made uſe of it himſelf in the great and dreadful Plague at <hi>Rome,</hi> and tells us that none miſcarried that made uſe of it (peradventure he means none that ever he knew of) and yet for a Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive they have and will do as much as God and Nature will permit. And ſo far was I from concealing them for private ends and intereſt, that I then publiſhed the compoſition of them for publike uſe and benefit; and not only my own, but many Apothecaties about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41384:17"/>
prepared them, though not ſo exactly and truly as I could have wiſhed, which hath made me ſince often repent their publiſhing.</p>
               <p>There is two or three Diſeaſes more that this Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zange is eminently good for, as well as this we have mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> Worms, and Convulſions in children, two or three of them being beaten to powder, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in any convenient <hi>Vehicle:</hi> alſo <hi>Vertigo</hi> or giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Hyſterical</hi> vapours, or Fits of the Mother, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive Coughs and Catarrhs, cauſed by a thin di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation of hot, acid, and ſalt humours falling upon the Lungs from the head; if the Rhume be hot, 'tis ſharp and thin, and in this caſe you will find them of excellent uſe and great worth, uſing alſo the outward helps of fumes and ſcents as formerly directed.</p>

               <head>The Concluſion</head>
               <p>ANd ſumm of all reduc'd to practice, is that all ſuch perſons as are now in the Countries, and are to return to the City, would (in the fear of God) make uſe of ſuch neceſſary and reaſonable helps as are propounded for their preſervation in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Treatiſe. <hi>Unum è majoribus,</hi> or one of the chief of which indeed that firſt occaſioned this diſcourſe, is, that before they come ſo near <hi>London</hi> as to receive its infection, they would put up into their Noſtrils a bit of Sponge dipt in <hi>Venice Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine</hi> and <hi>Vinegar of Roſes;</hi> as in <hi>pag. 15.</hi> and keep a Lozange conſtantly in their mouth, ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it down as it diſſolves; and before they enter their houſes, either to get them well aired by others, or elſe to do it themſelves, as is directed in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Caution, and in the <hi>6 page</hi> of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Terebinth</hi> for their Noſtrils may be had at any Apothecaries in every Country Town; the Lozange and Paſtil requiring nine or ten dayes at leaſt to prepare and compleat it, could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41384:18"/>
or more conveniently ordered, and therefore I have taken care that they ſhall be in a readineſs (at better and eaſier rates than people can provide them) at Mr. <hi>Reads</hi> an Apothecary, &amp;c. and at thoſe places where they are directed in the Title page for to have the Books.</p>
               <p>And to this end it is neceſſary, and concerns ſuch as are in <hi>London,</hi> and have their friends in the Country, to give them timely notice of it, and to take care they may have one of the Books to peruſe at their leiſure, for their preſervation and health, which undoubtedly God permits the ſons of men, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and recompence of their prudence, care, and vertues.</p>

               <hi>THis publike Calamity (like a great and common fire) hath occaſioned all men, though more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſome Phyſitians, to beſtir themſelves, and caſt about for water (as it were) to quench and put it out. But as this is one of Gods</hi> Jura Regalia, <hi>and not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken but with great reverence, circumſpection, awe, and ſubordination to his will, yet natural helps upon Gods terms; which (becauſe not better to be improved) I chooſe in the very words of</hi> Sirach <hi>to his ſon</hi> Jeſus, <hi>thus to expreſs:</hi> In thy ſickneſs be not negligent, but pray unto the Lord, and he will make thee whole: Leave off from ſin, and order thy wayes aright, and cleanſe thy heart from all wickedneſs: Then give place to the Phyſitian, for the Lord hath created him; let not him go from thee, for thou haſt need of him: The hour may come that their endeavours may have good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; for they alſo ſhall pray unto the Lord that he would proſper that which is given for the prolonging of life: for the Lord hath created Medicines out of the

Earth, and he that is wiſe will not abhorr them: and he hath given men skill, that he might be honoured in his marvellous works, for of the <hi>MOST HIGH</hi> cometh healing.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe conſiderations I have brought forth my two Water-pots, one formerly, relating to the <hi>Curative,</hi> this to the <hi>Preventive</hi> part of Phyſick: if any one <hi>drop</hi> of either hath, or ſhall do good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let God be glorified.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe (and that only <hi>diminute)</hi> is in relation to the <hi>Preſervative</hi> part of Phyſick, or Conſervation of health which all people ſafely may, and ought to know and conſider of to the utmoſt. The other parts of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, which I have omitted (like School-Divinity) is better let alone and concealed, than medled with; the difficulties of Phyſick being as dangerous as doubtful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations; and in both, <hi>nihil plus periculi quam imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectâ ſcientiâ.</hi> And therefore (it not properly depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that part I have treated on, and alſo that people might have all helps that are neceſsary) I thought good to give notice that it will be requiſite, ſo ſoon as time and opportunity will permit, to adviſe with ſome able Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian that may help and aſsiſt you in the <hi>Therapeutick</hi> and <hi>Pharmaleutick</hi> part of Phyſick; a work too difficult, and not to be ventured on, without perſonal and good advice, <hi>Curatur Socrates, non homo,</hi> and therefore though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but adviſe the uſe of ſome purging medicines, either before or after your return, (but rather before) yet the <hi>Remedii genus,</hi> or what Specifick purge (not knowing for whom) I leave<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
