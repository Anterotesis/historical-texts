            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>PROPOSALS Humbly Offered to Raiſe <hi>Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Thouſand</hi> Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> to make Good the
<hi>Adulterated</hi> and <hi>Defaced</hi> COIN of this Kingdom,
without hurting the <hi>Subject;</hi> by drawing it from all
parts of the Kingdom, Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> &amp;c. which
will not only be a great <hi>Conveniency</hi> to all manner
of <hi>Traders, Gentlemen,</hi> and others, but alſo mightily
<hi>Propagate</hi> and <hi>Increaſe Dealings</hi> of all kinds.</p>
               <p>This, I humbly conceive, may be done, without great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
by taking the <hi>Methods</hi> following: And I hope to
Anſwer, rationally, all the Objections which may be Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
againſt it. The Propoſals take as follow: <hi>(Viz.)</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>WERE there Four <hi>Grand Chambers
of Accompts</hi> Erected in <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Imprimis.</note> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Metropolitan City</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
to anſwer all Counties in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Wales,</hi> &amp;c. and thoſe nominated the Principal or Grand
Chambers of each County, or Diviſion; and let them
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61243:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have power to fix a <hi>Petty Chamber</hi> in every <hi>Poſt-Town,</hi>
or <hi>Town of Trade,</hi> throughout the Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
for every <hi>Principal,</hi> or <hi>Grand Chamber,</hi> a <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Stamp,</hi> with Numbers, to be kept with every
<hi>Petty Chamber,</hi> ſo fixed as aforeſaid: And let all <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
Carriers, Chapmen,</hi> and <hi>Hagglers,</hi> be ſtrictly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
from Travelling with any <hi>Sum</hi> or <hi>Sums</hi> of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
(more than to Defray their <hi>Travelling Charges:</hi>)
But ſo often as occaſion offers, let each, and every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
pay ſuch greater <hi>Sums</hi> of <hi>Money</hi> into any of the
<hi>Chambers,</hi> from whence it may be Remitted to any
place, as deſired, with as great <hi>Expedition</hi> as the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Poſt</hi> can reach it: The party having his Money ſo
Remitted, paying for the ſame <hi>Three Pence per Pound,</hi>
or ſomething more or leſs, according to the diſtance
of place from whence it ſhall be ſo Remitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> IT is ſuppoſed (by common Computation)
there are <hi>Six Millions</hi> of people in the Kingdom of
<hi>England,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> &amp;c. (which if ſo) they
cannot ſubſiſt, one with another, for leſs Charge, in
<hi>Meat, Drink,</hi> and <hi>Apparel,</hi> than <hi>Seven</hi> Pounds <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
each perſon, which amounts to <hi>Forty Two Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
Yearly expended in the way of <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Commerce,</hi>
which at <hi>Three Pence</hi> per Pound, Annually paid for ſuch
<hi>Returns,</hi> or <hi>Tranſmittances of Money,</hi> as aforeſaid, amounts
to the <hi>Sum</hi> of <hi>Five Hundred Twenty Five Thouſand</hi>
Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> beſides the large <hi>Sums</hi> that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
in a Year for Houſhold Goods, Plate, Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> SUPPOSE a Merchant, or any other Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or Dealer, ſells his Goods, Cattle, or Wares, in
any part of the Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> receiving his <hi>Moneys</hi> for
the ſame, being the <hi>Sum</hi> of a <hi>Thouſand</hi> Pounds, more
or leſs, he or they paying ſuch <hi>Sum</hi> or <hi>Sums</hi> into the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61243:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Chamber</hi> next adjoyning, may have it <hi>remitted</hi> to any
part, without running any Hazard, paying into the
ſaid <hi>Chamber</hi> for the ſame, the Rate of <hi>Three Pence per
Pound,</hi> more or leſs, according to the diſtance of place
from the ſaid <hi>Chamber;</hi> and upon payment of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
into the ſaid <hi>Chamber,</hi> he ſhall receive a Bill of
Return indented; the <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>Chamber</hi> filing another
of the ſame Date; and a third ſo agreeing with the
two former, ſhall be ſent to the place where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to receive his Moneys, with advice to pay the
ſame to the ſaid party, or his order, upon ſight of the
parties Bill ſo mentioned, making ſuch payment in
good Currant Coin of <hi>England;</hi> and upon payment
thereof, to give his <hi>Receipt,</hi> indorſed upon the ſaid Bill,
for ſo much Moneys, as the ſaid Bill expreſſes to be
due; by which means every <hi>Petty Chamber</hi> may be able
to adjuſt his Accompts with the <hi>Grand Chambers</hi> of
<hi>London,</hi> as often as they ſhall be required to do the
ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> AS to the Furniſhing the ſaid Chambers with
<hi>Caſh</hi> ſufficient to anſwer ſuch Ends, I preſume
the <hi>Moneys</hi> Collected for the King's Tax; The Exciſe,
and other Moneys already Charged, and to be Charged,
by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> with Moneys payable for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Goods or Commodities through the Kingdom in
parts remote, being paid into the ſaid Chambers, in
each Town or County, as aforeſaid, in order to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to other parts of the Kingdom; may (as I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceive) anſwer the ENDS Propoſed with all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
that ſhall be made againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> WHEREAS it is thought the <hi>Mint</hi> cannot <hi>Coin</hi>
above <hi>Twenty Thouſand pounds</hi> per Week, there will be
ſome Years before the <hi>Caſh</hi> of the Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can be
Re-Coined: NOW I conceive, that <hi>Forty Thouſand pounds</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61243:3"/>
will be ſufficient <hi>Fund</hi> to begin this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking;</hi> each
<hi>Chamber</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> ſignifying to their ſeveral petty
Chambers throughout the Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſend up to
<hi>London</hi> all the <hi>Large Moneys</hi> they can pick out of their
<hi>Caſh,</hi> in order to have it <hi>Exchanged,</hi> at the <hi>Mint,</hi> for
<hi>MIL'D MONEY:</hi> So that the <hi>Mint</hi> may by kept in <hi>Full
Employ</hi> of <hi>Coining;</hi> and <hi>New Money</hi> from time to time
ſhall be Tranſmitted back, or otherwiſe paid to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors,</hi>
(of the Old) where they ſhall deſire it; which
will make the firſt Years <hi>Coinage</hi> to ſuſtain <hi>no great</hi> Loſs;
The ſecond Year <hi>not much</hi> more, and the Third <hi>not much</hi>
greater than the precedent: So that the <hi>Profits</hi> in the
<hi>Stock</hi> of this <hi>Bank</hi> will <hi>not much</hi> leſſon the <hi>firſt</hi> year;
poſſibly <hi>ſomething</hi> more the <hi>ſecond,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> much more
the <hi>third:</hi> From whence I Conclude, There may be a
<hi>ſufficient Fund</hi> to Anſwer the <hi>Loſs</hi> of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>abuſed Caſh;</hi>
which I take to be little leſs than <hi>Two Millions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> FROM all which, I humbly conceive, That
by this <hi>Method</hi> (in a reaſonable time) the <hi>Caſh</hi> of this
Kingdom may be wholly <hi>Re-Coined, Trade,</hi> and <hi>Commerce</hi>
highly advanced; Gentlemens <hi>Eſtates</hi> much improved,
beſides the Conveniency of having their Rents ſafely and
quickly Tranſmitted them, to any part of the Kingdom
remote; the <hi>great loſs</hi> of many by <hi>High-Way-Men</hi> totally
prevented; the <hi>Poſt-Office</hi> much advanced (and many more
accrewing Benefits and Advantages to the <hi>Government,</hi> and
<hi>Subject,</hi> produced) than can, at preſent, be ſeen into, and
too large here to Enumerate: And ſuppoſing the <hi>Mint</hi>
ſhall be able to <hi>Coin</hi> Forty thouſand pounds <hi>per Diem,</hi>
Care may be taken to ſupply the <hi>Mint</hi> with <hi>old moneys,</hi>
or <hi>Bullion</hi> (that if poſſibly ſo much can be <hi>Coined</hi> in the
time) all may be Compleated in a Year, or two, at the
furtheſt; from the time, <hi>Offices</hi> or <hi>Chambers</hi> of <hi>Accompts,</hi>
ſhall be ſo fixed as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61243:3"/>
               <hi>NOW rationally to prove the ſame in every part, and to
make the whole Matter more plain and eaſy to be
Underſtood, (by the meaneſt Capacities of all Traders,
and Dealers of what kind ſoever, who will be Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
in ſuch manner, as is before propoſed) I ſhall
endeavour to demonſtrate how the ſame may be done
with eaſe, as may be obſerved by the</hi> Methods <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,</hi>
viz.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>ſt.</hi> SUPPOSE the <hi>Four Grand-Chambers</hi> ſo Erected
in <hi>London,</hi> be ſubſtituted for <hi>Four Diviſions,</hi>
viz. <hi>Eaſt, Weſt, North,</hi> and <hi>South;</hi> and ſo
Dividing the <hi>Poſt</hi> and <hi>Market-Towns</hi> into <hi>four Diviſions,</hi>
throughout the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> &amp;c.
placing <hi>Clerks</hi> in each <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Diſtinctly
for each <hi>County;</hi> each County having a <hi>Different Seal,</hi>
and the <hi>Clerks</hi> of the <hi>Poſt,</hi> and <hi>Market-Towns</hi> of the

ſame <hi>County</hi> in the <hi>Grand Chambers</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> to be kept
by them, with <hi>Numbers</hi> in their Books, of <hi>All Returns,</hi>
from Place to Place, with the <hi>Indentures.</hi> I ſuppoſe it
may make it eaſy to be <hi>Adjuſted</hi> on all ſides: And the
<hi>Directors</hi> of the <hi>Grand-Chambers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> may, with
eaſe, <hi>Inſpect All</hi> the <hi>Returns</hi> which ſhall be made by the

throughout the Kingdom, during the time our Old
<hi>Money</hi> ſhall be <hi>Re-Coining,</hi> or longer, if it ſhall be ſo
approved on, and thought <hi>requiſite,</hi> by which means
each Town may have a Bank of <hi>money</hi> by them, which,
(as I conceive) will be no ſmall <hi>Increaſe of Riches</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kingdom, cauſing all <hi>Manufactories</hi> to flouriſh
much more than hitherto they have done, the failure
of which is thought to be for want of <hi>monies</hi> among
them, which has occaſioned many <hi>Country People</hi> to
try their Fortunes in <hi>London,</hi> where <hi>money</hi> is more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which hath much <hi>depopulated</hi> the Country, thereby
<hi>damnifying</hi> very much both <hi>Gentlemens Eſtates,</hi> and
done great injury to all <hi>manufacturies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FURTHER, There are ſeveral <hi>Principal Towns</hi> and
places of Trade, as <hi>Exeter, Norwich, Colcheſter, Hull,
Leeds,</hi> &amp;c. wherein the Goods are bought by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the ſaid places, and there vended, which
<hi>monies,</hi> with the <hi>Kings Revenues,</hi> being paid into the
Bank of the ſaid places, muſt inevitably be <hi>equivolent</hi>
to the <hi>manufuctures</hi> made in the ſaid Towns, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
elſe-where: For ſuppoſe each of thoſe do <hi>vend</hi> and
make <hi>great quantities</hi> of <hi>Woollen manufacturies,</hi> being the
<hi>Staple Commodities</hi> of the Kingdom, the more they make
the better, being the <hi>greater number</hi> of People muſt be
imployed therein: And we find by <hi>experience,</hi> That by
the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God, Noblemen, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Shopkeepers, Merchants,</hi> &amp;c. are ſo promiſcuouſly
inter mixed in Towns and Villages among Handicrafts,
being ſubſervient one to another, as <hi>different members</hi>
of one and the ſame body; and ſuppoſing there are
<hi>Twenty</hi> or <hi>Thirty Thouſand</hi> Souls in each Town or
place: Theſe muſt all be <hi>Fed</hi> and <hi>Cloathed,</hi> with all
things according to their ſeveral Ranks and Qualities,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61243:5"/>
and, by <hi>conſequence,</hi> muſt Trade in <hi>Linnen, Woollen, Silk,</hi>
&amp;c, and in all <hi>Grocery Wares, Wine, Oyl, Tobacco, Iron,
Lead, Tin, Copper, Glaſs,</hi> &amp;c. and in all ſorts of <hi>Grain,
Cattle, Fruits, Dyes,</hi> and <hi>Druggs,</hi> without which, no
place can well ſubſiſt. Now let the <hi>Traders</hi> of the ſaid
Towns, and Villages nigh adjacent, pay into the Banks
of the ſaid places, all the <hi>monies</hi> they ſhall receive for
the Goods <hi>vended</hi> by them: The prime coſt of all ſuch
Goods conſumed, together with the Money Collected
for <hi>Exciſe,</hi> the <hi>Land Tax</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> being paid into
the next Chamber, or Bank, in or nigh the place,
muſt make a ſufficient Fund of Monies in all the Banks
of each County, Town, or City, to anſwer all Goods
and Manufactories that ſhall come out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
being the prime Coſt of <hi>materials</hi> are allowed for:
But if any Merchant or Dealer ſuppoſe the Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
made in the Countries, and ſent abroad, are of
greater value than the prime Coſt of Goods, that are
bought and conſumed in the Countrys; I beg to know
how it happens, That ſuch Town or Country has not
gain'd the greateſt part of the Kingdoms Wealth; which,
if any perſon ſatisfies me in, I ſhall look upon all my
pains, and ſerious thoughts, about this Project, to be vain
imaginations, and ſhall deſiſt further to urge it.</p>
            <p>AND further, I conceive it will be the intereſt of
all Country Gentlemen and Traders, to lodge what
Moneys they can ſpare from their immediate occaſions
in ſuch Chambers of Strength and Security, ſo ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

preſerve many Mens Lives, who frequently Suffer by

leſſoned the Number of People in this Kingdom, who

            <p>

may be worth <hi>Five hundred thouſand pounds, per Annum.</hi>
or more, without hurting the Subject (as I have ſet
forth in the Preamble) paying no more for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns

the Terms in my Propoſitions being ſo eaſy (and

Grudge, at, (obtaining ſo great a Benefit by it,

            </p>

               <p>I conceive the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi>
&amp;c. are bleſſed with as many uſeful and ſtaple Commodities, as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61243:8"/>
are in any parts of the world, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Wool, Lead, Tin, Leather,
Shoes, Boots, Stockings, and many more, too large to enumerate:
And being neither Bullion nor Coin can be eat, drank, or wore, why
ſhould theſe Commodities he ſent abroad? I preſume, the Army
may be maintained with conſiderable Advantage to the Nation, if
duely weighed and inſpected into, increaſing a great Trade, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to our Handicrafts of all ſorts, and thereby keeping them in
full employ, which would leſſen the price of all ſuch goods in general.</p>
               <p>AND ſhould ſo many Goods be bought up as would amount to
the Sum fixed on by this <hi>Honourable Houſe,</hi> for the maintenance of
the Army abroad, they may procure a Credit in <hi>Holland,</hi> or <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
or in any City, or great Town in thoſe parts, where ſuch
Goods ſhall be conſumed, being bought here at much eaſier rates,
than they can be afforded at in thoſe parts.</p>

Quantities of ſuch Goods are ſent to <hi>Holland,</hi> and other parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning,
which muſt either by conſumed in thoſe places, to which
they are conſign'd, or elſe they are ſent from thence to other parts
remote.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE, ſhould Factors be employed in <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. to Buy up ſuch Goods: And likewiſe Factors pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in <hi>Holland, Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. to whom they ſhould be conſign'd for the
KING's uſe, they may be ſold with advantage, to raiſe Moneys ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to pay the Army in thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>AND ſhould not the ſaid Factors be able to vend ſo many, as to
ſupply the KING's occaſions in paying his Army, yet the ſaid Goods
may be a ſufficient Fund to borrow Monies on, either from the
States of <hi>Holland,</hi> or from the Burghers of Cities or great Towns
in thoſe parts, at <hi>Three</hi> Pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi> which Monies ſo borrowed
may be re-paid as often as ſuch Goods ſhall be vended.</p>
               <p>NOW ſuppoſing the Kingdom pays but <hi>Eight</hi> Pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi>
in the return of Coin, by this means <hi>Five</hi> Pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi> will be
ſaved to the Nation, ſhould ſuch Goods be ſold only for the prime
Coſt, which will cauſe a great Conſumption of our Commodities,
and keep our Coin and Bullion at Home; and it may highly
diſcourage the common Enemy, when it ſhall appear we make
an Advantage in Trade by the War, in vending our Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
and preventing the Exportation of our Coin and Bullion.</p>

AND when the Re-Coining of the Monies ſhall be complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Bullion may be permitted to riſe and fall, as at other times,
not exceeding the Money Coined, by which means it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the melting down of <hi>Caſh</hi> by Work-men, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
it into other Nations; which will lower the Intereſt
of Monies more effectually, than any Bank whatſoever can do.</p>
               <p>NOW my Propoſals being no further intended than for the
Service and Benefit of the Kingdom in general, by a Method
of raiſing 500000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> without laying a Tax upon
the Subject, and procuring them ready Monies to be paid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occaſions in any part of the Kingdom: As alſo the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Monies in returning the KING's Tax; and by how
much ready Money in all Payments will be better and fairer
in Dealings, I humbly ſubmit the conſideration thereof to the
great Wiſdom of this Honourable Houſe, who may Order the
KING's Money to be paid in ſuch Methods as before Propoſed,
which (as I humbly conceive) may Anſwer ſuch Good Ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe Propoſals I intended to have preſented to the laſt
Seſſion of Parliament, but could not compleat them before the
Prorogation.</hi>
