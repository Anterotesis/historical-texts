            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>There is a ſaying in <hi>Homer,</hi> that Children for the moſt

part prooue, worſe then their parents, ſeldome any better, but in this King it fell out otherwiſe: For his father was a man of euill diſpoſition, much giuen to ryot and exceſſe, and greatly led by ſicophants and flatterers, of which ſort the principall were twoo Noble men of the houſe of the <hi>Spencers.</hi> Theſe ſo bewitched the Kings minde, that by their counſell and inſtigation hee put to death ſome twoo and twenty of the chiefeſt Barons of <hi>England,</hi> and not ſo contented, baniſhed alſo his Wife and her Son wholy out of the Realme. But the Queene at length, through the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of her faithfull friends beeing brought backe with her Sonne into <hi>England,</hi> not onlye exacted moſt ſeuere puniſhment vppon thoſe flatterers the Father and the Son, but further for diuers graue and weighty conſiderations, by authority of Parliament remooued her huſband from ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſtate as a perſon vnfit for gouernment, and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to ſafe cuſtodie. Which done, the worthy Prince <hi>Edward</hi> (a moſt vertuous Son of a moſt vitious Father) who before had liued in exile with his Mother, as is already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, was crowned King of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>London</hi> by the name of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, in the Sixteenth yeare of his age, and the yeare of our Lord 1326. He tooke to Wife <note place="margin">1326.</note> 
                  <hi>Phillip</hi> the daughter of <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>Henault</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whome he had formerly begun to fancy amongſt the reſt of her Siſters at ſuch time as he came with his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a baniſhed perſon out of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Henault.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Peeres of <hi>Fraunce</hi> after the death of King <hi>Charles,</hi> would in no wiſe admit his Siſter (matched to the King of <hi>England)</hi> to the ſucceſſion of the crowne, becauſe it was now of old receiued as a cuſtome in that country, not to leaue the charge of ſo great a Kingdome to bee mannaged by the diſcretion of women. Wherevppon they likewiſe renounced <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, her Sonne and Grand-childe to King <hi>Phillip</hi> as deſcending of the female line: and ſo with one conſent they gaue the ſcepter and ſoueraignty to <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Valoys,</hi> couſen germain to King <hi>Phillip</hi> deceaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:5967:3"/>
Vppon this occaſion enſued moſt cruell warres and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enmity, <hi>Edward</hi> the Third preſuming that he had more rightfull intereſt, and a better title to the kingdome of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> then <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aloys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to further this quarrell, it ſo fell out, that a certain Noble man of great account called <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Artoys,</hi> one <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toys</hi> commeth into <hi>England,</hi> and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> who had been long of ſinguler reſpect and eſtimation with King <hi>Phillip,</hi> at length falling in his disfauor, was baniſhed the Court, and could be ſuffered to reſt in no place by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon of the kings diſpleaſure. This man after many wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, at laſt arriued in <hi>England</hi> where hee found quiet harbour and abiding: and being by the King entertained as a counſellor, ceaſed not by his perſwaſions to prouoke and ſtirre him vp to armes againſt the French King.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> purpoſing to warre vppon <hi>Phillip,</hi> ſollicited the frendſhippe of the Flemmings, at that time remaining ſcarce in due obedience of their Lord: whereof the French King hauing intelligence, by the helpe of the Earle of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoiourning in his Court, he procured certain places of <hi>Flaunders</hi> to bee fortified, where the Engliſh men muſt of neceſſity paſſe when they ſhould come into <hi>Fraunce.</hi> The King of <hi>England</hi> ſent his forces againſt them and in a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched field the Flemmings were ouer throwne and chaſed.</p>
               <p>And further for the better diſpatch of his affaires and to compaſſe the fauour of the Germaine Princes, the King of <hi>England</hi> came himſelfe to <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> where he entred into a league of amitie with the Dukes of <hi>Gelders,</hi> and <hi>Iuliers,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Colen,</hi> and diuers others. And that the Emperour ſhould take no offence thereat, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, the Duke of <hi>Iuliers</hi> ſhould be addreſſed vnto him in the name of the King of <hi>England</hi> and the reſt, to acquainte him with theſe proceedings. The Emperour was ſo farre from diſlike of the matter, that he alſo created the King of <hi>England</hi> Lievetenant Generall of the Romaine Empire.</p>
               <p>The chiefe cauſe why <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bauier</hi> the Emperour, ſo highly honoured the King of <hi>England,</hi> was for that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:5967:4"/>
during the tumults of the warres, hee might happily take ſome opportunity to recouer againe the Citie of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi> which being indeed a Citie imperiall, was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with-holden from him by the French men.</p>
               <p>The French King in the meane while contracted a league with <hi>Dauid</hi> King of Scottes, who for the ſame purpoſe came with his Wife to <hi>Paris.</hi> Hee ſent alſo a power into <hi>Scotland</hi> to moleſt the Engliſh at home, that thereby their forces might be more weakened, and the King of <hi>Englands</hi> puiſſance abated.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> proceeding in his purpoſe, with the power of his confederates beſieged <hi>Cambray</hi> to recouer <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cambray</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.</note> it againe to the Empire. But the Citie was ſo well proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both of munition and victuall, that hee attempted it in vaine: wherefore abandoning the ſiege, hee paſſed with his forces into <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aſſoone as the Engliſh army was entred into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Henault,</hi> who of late ſucceeded in the roome of his deceaſed Father, and had been preſent at the ſiege of <hi>Cambray</hi> (as a matter of dutye in regard it concerned the Empire) refuſed now any longer to ſerue the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for feare of diſpleaſing the French King, becauſe hee thought that in this warre the King of <hi>England</hi> rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his own buſines then the affaires of the Empire.</p>
               <p>The French King at ſuch time as his enemies forces were aduanced againſt him, and that the armyes on both ſides ſtoode ready raunged in order of battell, albeit hee had a farre greater power then the King of <hi>England,</hi> (as hauing in his armye aboue an hundreth thouſand men,) yet notwithſtanding, partly perſwaded by his Lords, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally terrifyed by the letters of <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Sicill</hi> his neere kinſeman an excellent Aſtronomer, hee withdrew himſelfe and departed without giuing battell. And ſo the King of <hi>England</hi> returned into <hi>Braband,</hi> and the French King into his own Country, much diſpleaſed with himſelfe that he had refuſed to fight. The King of <hi>England</hi> ſhortly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:5967:4"/>
after being well aſſured of the faithfulnes of his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, paſſed ouer into his own kingdome.</p>
               <p>About this time in the Citie of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> a certaine perſon of the baſer ſort named <hi>Jaques</hi> of <hi>Arteuill,</hi> purchaſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſuch eſtimation among the commons, that in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of time there was none able to withſtand his bold attempts, no not the Earle of <hi>Flaunders</hi> himſelfe. The King of <hi>England</hi> to procure the good will of the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> allyed this fellow vnto him, as one that might affoord him much helpe in his warres hereafter. Of this <hi>Iaques</hi> hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth we ſhall often haue occaſion to make mention.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> before hee returned into his owne conntrey as is a little before declared, had obtained a grant of the <hi>Flemmings</hi> to ayde him in his warres, whereby him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe might not onely aſſayle his enemie with the greater force, but they alſo recouer their loſt towns, as <hi>Liſle, Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and certaine others holden at that time by the <hi>French.</hi> But the <hi>Flemmings</hi> pretended great difficulty in the matter, before they would conclude this league with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For they had formerly couenanted with the <hi>French</hi> King, and bound themſelues vppon the forfeiture of twenty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth thouſand crownes, neuer to beare armes againſt the King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and theſe conditions were ratified by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Hereupon they perſwaded the King of <hi>England</hi> to take vpon him the armes and ſtile of the Realme of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and in ſo doing they thought themſelues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of their oath. The King after much deliberation <note place="margin">King <hi>Edward</hi> taketh vppon him the title of <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
                  </note> condiſcended to their requeſts, and ſo the league was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed betweene them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King hauing intelligence of the matter, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed with the <hi>Flemmings</hi> by ſome friends of his, as it were in the name of the Pope, to forſake the King of <hi>England</hi> and adhere to him againe, adding large promiſes of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: all which notwithſtanding they refuſed, wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon preſently enſued the Popes thunderbolt. It made the <hi>Flemmings</hi> ſhrewdly affraid, but the King of <hi>England</hi> ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:5967:5"/>
and hartened them by letters and meſſengers, that they brookt the matter with the better patience. Then beganne the warres to growe hot between the <hi>Flemmings</hi> and <hi>French</hi> men, and the King of <hi>Fraunce</hi> ſent his eldeſt Sonne as Generall, who with a puiſſant Armye marched through the country euen as farre as <hi>Henault.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſte <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>Henault</hi> for the eſtabliſhing of his affayres, trauailed firſt into <hi>England,</hi> and afterward to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Emperour, the <hi>French</hi> men in his abſence did meruaillouſly afflict his country by making continuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions vpon it. But the Earle at his returne out of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> hauing aſſociated himſelfe with the King of <hi>England,</hi> the Emperour, and diuers Princes of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> rayſed a mighty power, and being alſo ayded by him, who in a manner had the hearts of the <hi>Flemmings</hi> at commaund, I meane <hi>Iaques</hi> of <hi>Artevile,</hi> enforced his enemies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre.</p>
               <p>So the Armyes on both ſides being prepared to fight, the Earle of <hi>Henault</hi> was very deſirous to come to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter: but the Duke of <hi>Braband</hi> was of another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and with weightie reaſons diſſwaded him from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding the battaile till ſuch time as the King of <hi>England</hi> were returned, whome they accounted as Generall of this warre.</p>
               <p>Aſſoone as the <hi>French</hi> King vnderſtood the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was departed into his owne countrey, he gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement that a fleete of Shippes ſhould preſently bee rigged and put forth to Sea, to attend his comming backe, and then to aſſayle him with great violence, and bend all their forces to empeach his landing. But the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> encountring them in his paſſage, put them valiantly to the worſe, and with fortunes fauourable aſſiſtance arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſafely in <hi>Flaunders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Sicill</hi> of whome wee haue formerly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, foreſeeing by the Art of Aſtrologie, that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Fraunce</hi> ſhould ſuſtaine great dammage by the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:5967:5"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, for the great affection he bare to that Realme, trauailed himſelfe to <hi>Auinion,</hi> and there made earneſt ſute to the Pope and Colledge of Cardinalls, that they would ſet an attonement betweene thoſe twoo puiſſant Princes. They promiſed to employ their endeuours, ſo the mindes of the kings were diſpoſed according.</p>
               <p>About this time the <hi>Brabanders, Flemmings,</hi> and <hi>Heno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,</hi> entred into a moſt ſtrict league among themſelues, in ſuch ſort that if any of thoſe countryes ſhould happen to be moleſted with warre, or afflicted by any other meanes, the reſt were bound to ſuccour and aſſiſt them: And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſſention or variance chaunced, they ſhould arbitrate the matter among themſelues, or elſe if the caſe were ſuch that they could not decyde it, then it ſhould bee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the diſcretion of the King of <hi>England,</hi> into whoſe hands they were all ſworne to put the controuerſie and to abide by his arbitriment.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> aſſociated with the ayd of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, beſieged <hi>Tourney</hi> with a ſtrong army. Many aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tournay</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.</note> were giuen, but they preuailed not by reaſon of the valiant defence made by the Townſemen, who were furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed throughly aforehand, both with men and all thinges needefull to offend the enemye by commaundement from the <hi>French</hi> King, who was ptiuie to a great part of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes and conſultations among his enemies.</p>
               <p>During the ſiege before <hi>Tourney,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King ſending certain companies into <hi>Scotland,</hi> erneſtly entreated the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains left there in Garriſon for the ſafty of their country by King <hi>Dauid,</hi> to make ſome invaſion vppon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that by this meanes his enemie might bee enforced to rayſe his ſiege and returne for the defence of his own country: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing moreouer that he would ſend them ſtore of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers whoſe ſeruice they might employ in that action. The <hi>Scots</hi> ſtoutly vndertaking the matter, wonne certain holdes and much endammaged their enemy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King in the meane while levied a great armye
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:5967:6"/>
to rayſe the ſiege before <hi>Tourney.</hi> There came to his ayde <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Boheme,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Burgoine, Britaine, Burbon,</hi> and <hi>Loraine,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Bar, Sauoy, Geneua, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauſon,</hi> and <hi>Flaunders.</hi> And beſides theſe, the kings of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the one as confederate, the other as feudarie to the crowne of <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Earle of <hi>Flaunders</hi> followed the <hi>French</hi> King as we haue declared, whilſte the Flemmings tooke part with the Engliſh, let it not ſeeme ſtraunge to any, for thus ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the caſe. This <hi>Iaques</hi> of <hi>Arteuill</hi> whome we ſpake of before, was become ſo popular and growne to ſuch autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie amongſt the commons, that the Earle himſelfe could finde no ſafe abyding in his own country, but was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for that cauſe to commit himſelfe to the protection of the French King.</p>
               <p>The ſiege of <hi>Tourney</hi> continued ſome three moneths, <note place="margin">A truce taken for twelue moneths.</note> during which ſpace <hi>Iane</hi> oſ <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aloys</hi> the French kings ſiſter, and mother to the Earle of <hi>Henault,</hi> laboured very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to procure a compoſition. At length ſhee obtained thus much, that a day was appointed for a meeting to be had betweene the Lords of <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> where they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpon a truce for twelue months ſpace, with conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that each party ſhould hold whatſoeuer he had gotten by battell. Herevppon the armies were both diſmiſſed. And this further was concluded, that at a certain time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed within the yeare, another treatie ſhould be had at <hi>Arras,</hi> where commiſſioners from both Princes, and from Pope <hi>Clement</hi> ſhould meete together, and this likewiſe was performed. There the Engliſh men demaunded much, and the French men profered nothing, ſaue the Earledome of <hi>Ponthiew,</hi> which was giuen before in dowrie to King <hi>Edwards</hi> mother, when ſhee married into <hi>England.</hi> More <note place="margin">Prolonged for twelue moneths more.</note> then thus was nothing done in this treaty, onely another yeere added to the truce, and the King of <hi>England</hi> returned into his Country.</p>
               <p>When things were thus ſet at a ſtay, and that the Duke
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:5967:6"/>
of <hi>Britaine</hi> prepared to returne into his owne country, he <note place="margin">The occaſion of the warres in <hi>Britaine.</hi>
                  </note> was ſeiſed vppon in his iourney by a moſt violent ſicknes, whereof in ſhort ſpace he dyed, leauing behind no lawfull iſſue male to ſucceed him. He had two brothers, of whome the one which was Earle of <hi>Mountfort,</hi> was his brother onely by the fathers ſide, the other both by father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but he died before him leauing iſſue one only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whome the Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> in his life time ioyned in marriage to <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bloys</hi> ſiſters Son to <hi>Phillip</hi> the French <note place="margin">Charles <hi>of</hi> Bloys.</note> King. For the Duke fearing it might ſo fall out, that after his deceaſe his brother the Earle of <hi>Mountfort</hi> would ſeiſe the ſeigniory of <hi>Britaine</hi> into his owne handes, and by that meanes diſpoſſeſſe, and as it were diſinherite the lawfull daughter of his brother by the whole bloud, thought good to prouide a ſtay for the Lady by marriage, and therefore his deſire was the rather to match her to the kings ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, becauſe if the other ſhould make any atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he might the eaſilier be reſiſted. And ſo it came to paſſe. For the Earle of <hi>Mountfort</hi> had no ſooner vnderſtanding of his brothers death, but that partly by force, &amp; partly by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he poſſeſſed himſelfe of the greater part of <hi>Britane.</hi> And then the better to ſupporte his cauſe and ſtabliſh his eſtate, he went ouer to the King of <hi>England,</hi> where relating the whole diſcourſe of his proceedings, he receiued from him the inueſtiture of his dukedome. And the King of <hi>England</hi> conſidering that by this meanes he might haue a ready paſſage through <hi>Britaine</hi> into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> promiſed both his councell and furtherance to the newe Duke againſt his enemie, whether it were the French King or any other whoſoeuer. For he had loſt the French kings fauor before, euer ſince he brought in the Germaines to ſerue in his warres, vppon whome he had ſpent ſuch a huge maſſe of money, withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> accompliſhing any notable enterpriſe. And this is the true cauſe and originall ground of this warre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bloys</hi> being aduertiſed of the proceedings and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5967:7"/>
enterpriſes of <hi>Mountfort,</hi> made great complaint of him to the French King. After conſultation had, the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that the Earle ſhould be ſummoned to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Earle came, and after ſome deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings on both ſides, he was enioyned by the King not to depart the Citie for a certaine ſeaſon. Neuertheleſſe he conueyed himſelfe ſecretly away, and ſo ſentence was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with <hi>Charles.</hi> It was a great blot in <hi>Mountforts</hi> caſe that he had been inueſted in his Duchie by the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And thervppon the French King denouncing <hi>Charles</hi> to be rightfull heyre, encouraged him with his own mouth to recouer by force of armes the ſeigniorie due vnto him both by iudgement of law and right of inheritance: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing not only his owne ayde, but procuring other Lords alſo to aſſiſt him in the maintenance of his rightful quarrell. The warre was vndertaken (in the behalfe of <hi>Charles)</hi> with the power of the Peeres of <hi>Fraunce</hi> his friendly aſſiſtants. Beſides other, at length the Citie of <hi>Nants</hi> (the principall in thoſe partes) was forced by aſſault. There <hi>Mountfort</hi> himſelfe was taken priſoner, and from thence conueyed to <hi>Paris</hi> to the King, by whoſe commaundement being caſt in priſon, he there ended his life. His Lady in the meane time bearing her fortune with a true manlike reſolution, encouraged the fainting hearts of her people, and both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with Garriſons and furniſhed with victuals; the reſt of the holdes yet vntaken by the enemie.</p>
               <p>Vppon concluſion of the truce between the kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and diſſoluing the ſiege before <hi>Tournay,</hi> the King of <hi>England</hi> returning home, perceiued what great annoyance the Scottes had wrought to his country in the meane while: wherevppon he aſſembled an Armie. The Scottes being preſſed with great extremitie in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the King, purchaſed a truce of the Engliſh vppon condition, that if within foure moneths ſpace the King did not prouide for the reſcue, they ſhould yeeld. This was ſignified to the King of Scottes, who therevppon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:5967:7"/>
and being ayded with forraine power, wonne cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine holdes from the Engliſh. Amongſt other the Citie <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Durham</hi> take &amp; ſacked by the Scottiſh.</note> of <hi>Durham</hi> was one, where no mercy was ſhewen to no ſex, age, nor order whatſoeuer, but the very churches and all were conſumed with fire. Afterward perceiuing that by further proſecutiug his enterpriſe, he did but loſe his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and vnderſtanding moreouer that the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> approached with a mightie power, vppon deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his counſell, he retired: In the meane while mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring proffers of a truce which notwithſtanding he had no intention to admitte till he had firſt taken aduiſe of the French King with whome he was formerly confederate.</p>
               <p>The Lordes of <hi>Fraunce</hi> departing out of <hi>Britaine</hi> for no other reſpect but becauſe the winter whether compelled them, returned againe with their forces in the beginning <note place="margin">1342.</note> of Sommer, purpoſing to bring the reſt of that Duchy in ſubiection. Whereof the Lady of <hi>Mountfort</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, ſhee ſent ambaſſadours to the King of <hi>England,</hi> requiring ayde vppon this condition, that her Son whome ſhee had borne by the Earle of <hi>Mountfort,</hi> ſhould take to wife ſome one of the kings daughters. But the ſuccours which he ſent for, the ſpace of well nere twoo moneths to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether were toſt vppon the Seas with ſtormes and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie windes, in ſuch ſort as they could by no meanes attaine to their deſired porte, ſo that in the meane ſeaſon certaine places were recoured by the French men. But it is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to relate with what courrage and ſtowtneſſe the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Mountfort</hi> demeaned her ſelfe: Fot ſhee was not only content to fortifie ſtronge holdes, and encourage her fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers <note place="margin">The gallant carriage and warlike beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of the Lady <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>

Moreouer being beſieged in a certaine Caſtle and put to great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, when for the moſt part all that were about her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to yeeld, ſhee alone (amongſt men) perſiſted in opinion to the contrarie, and with this reſolution held it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:5967:8"/>
out ſo long till at laſt the Engliſh forces which had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a great while vppon the Seas, arriued to her reſcue.</p>
               <p>A certaine French captaine called <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> tooke the Citie of <hi>Dinant</hi> in <hi>Britaine</hi> by compoſition, the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens hauing ſlaine their gouernour in the market place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he refuſed to yeeld it. Another Citie neere adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning named <hi>Gerand,</hi> was taken by the ſame Captaine by force; where not ſo much as Children and little infants, nor the Temples conſecrated to Gods ſeruice, could eſcape the vttermoſt rigour of warre, but were all deſtroyed with fire and Sword. The Duke was much diſpleaſed with this impious cruelty, and worthylie cauſed the authors of ſuch wickedneſſe to be hanged. He alſo receiued the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>annes</hi> vppon compoſition without conſent of the captaine, and many other places beſides. To be ſhort, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe encounters paſſed both by Sea and Land with varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fortune on both ſides. A towne and Caſtle in thoſe partes called <hi>Hamibout,</hi> was aſſaulted with great violence, but defended with more valour, for therin at that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned the Ducheſſe of <hi>Britaine</hi> whome wee ſpake of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The French men perceiuing they ſpent their time in vaine, and that Winter began to approach, perſwaded <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bloys</hi> to diſmiſſe his Armie, and withall to take a truce, and place his ſouldiers in Garriſon. It was ſo done, and the Ducheſſe ſayled ouer to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who ſent an Armie into <hi>Britaine</hi> againſt the French men.</p>
               <p>About this time, the noble men of <hi>England</hi> counſelled their King to take a ſtedfaſt truce with the Scottes for three yeeres ſpace if it might be: ſhewing how great a burthen it would be to him to ſupporte ſo huge a charged of wars round about him, in <hi>Scotland</hi> on the one ſide, in <hi>Fraunce</hi> on the other. Herevppon Ambaſſadours were ſent to the Scottiſh King, but nothing could be effected, for he would determine vppon nothing without the French kings coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. The King of <hi>England</hi> mooued therewithall, rayſed a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:5967:8"/>
mightie power in purpoſe to bring the Scottes to vtter ſubuerſion. But in the meane time, by the mediation of good men a truce was obtained &amp; ſtabliſhed. The Engliſh Armie which we ſpake of erewhile, met with the French kings fleete well appointed, vppon the coaſt of <hi>Britaine.</hi> There they encountred one another and continued in fight till within the euening. Somewhat before midnight there aroſe a very dangerous tempeſt, which ſcattered them in ſuch ſort, that they were ſeparated more then an hundreth miles aſunder. In this conflict alſo, the Counteſſe of <hi>Mountfort</hi> her ſelfe performed knightly ſeruice. At length the Engliſh men recouered a hauen not farre from the City of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>annes,</hi> at that time in poſſeſſion of the French men, where putting on land their forces, they valiantly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Citie. And in concluſion diuiding their army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three partes, with two of them they fiercely aſſaulted the town in two ſeuerall places in the night ſeaſon, and whilſte al men reſorted thither to make reſiſtance, they brought the reſt of their forces to a place vnfortified and ſo entred the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vannes</hi> wone by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</note> towne, putting all that were in it eyther to the Sword or to flight.</p>
               <p>There were two French Lords which had the cuſtody of this towne, whome it full ſorely greeued to ſee the Citie thus taken. Therefore aſſembling ſuch forces as they could <note place="margin">Recouered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by the French.</note> rayſe vppon the ſuddaine, they gaue a freſh aſſault to the towne and ſo ſurpriſed it agine from the enemy. In theſe conflicts <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Artoys</hi> admirall of the Engliſh fleete, and Generall of the warre, was wounded: who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed to <hi>London</hi> for the cure of his hurts, in ſhort ſpace af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there ended his life. Whereat the king of <hi>England</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued <note place="margin">The death of <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toys.</hi>
                  </note> ſo great greefe and diſpleaſure, that of purpoſe to reuenge the death of ſo worthy a man, ſo deerely eſteemed, he himſelſe ſailed ouer with a mighty power of ſhipping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Britaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So great was the number of the Engliſh forces, that at one inſtant they beſieged three of the moſt puiſſant Cities
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:5967:9"/>
in all that countrey <hi>Renes, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>annes,</hi> and <hi>Nants,</hi> where <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bloys</hi> with his wife at the ſame time remained: beſides the towne of <hi>Dinant</hi> which they tooke by force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bloys</hi> wrote to the French King concerning the ſtate of his affaires, the arriuall of the Engliſh, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging of his townes: earneſtly requiring that he would ſuccour him in this great diſtreſſe. The French King ſent <note place="margin">1343.</note> his ſonne the Duke of <hi>Normandy:</hi> who with an Armie of ſome forty thouſand, tooke his way directly towardes <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>annes</hi> at that time very ſtreytly beſieged by the Engliſh. And had not the winter ſeaſon brought great impediment to their purpoſe, it had ſurelie come to a field battell. But at length through the interceſſion of twoo Cardinals ſent from Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> a truce was agreed vppon for three yeares, and a ſolemne o the taken of the Princes for the due <note place="margin">A truce for three yeares.</note> obſeruation thereof in the meane ſpace. So the King of <hi>England</hi> returned into his owne countrey.</p>

               <p>This act of the French kings was taken in ſo ill part by the King of <hi>England</hi> (eſteeming it done in his reproch) that he commaunded <hi>Henrie</hi> of <hi>Lyon</hi> to be preſently ſet at libertie, and freely forgaue him his raunſome: onelie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning him at his returne to ſignifie to the French King, how he interpreted theſe proceedings no otherwiſe then as intended to his diſhonour, and that thereby he held the late truce to be violated: wherefore he ſhould expect no other from him but as an enemy.

the ſouldiers put their Captaine in holde becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to yeeld it vp to the enemy, and would by no meanes graunt his liberty, but vppon conſent to their requeſt.

The Engliſhmen therefore drew a mine, &amp; ouerthrew a great part of it to the ground: then the captaine conſidering his imminent perill, abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the place and left the Caſtle to the Engliſh.

The King of <hi>England</hi> vnderſtanding in what diſtreſſe his men were, rayſed in continently a power of fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſouldiers. He was accompained amongſt other with his Son <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and a certain French Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman called <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Harecourt,</hi> who being expulſed his country by the French King, fled to the King of <hi>England</hi> for ſafegard of himſelfe, and reuenge of his iniuries: for the French King had ſeized vppon all his poſſeſſions. This <hi>Godfrey</hi> was the cauſe that the King of <hi>England</hi> directed his courſe into <hi>Normandy,</hi> being otherwiſe purpoſed to ſayle into <hi>Aquitaine.</hi> He diuided his Armie into three partes, whereof two raunged along the ſea coaſt, waſting the fields, ſacking diuers townes, and leading away their priſoners, leaſt afterward they might gather to a head and worke them ſome diſpleaſure. The third wherein was the King himſelfe, marched through the maine land, making hauocke of all things, and euery night they mette all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe at the kings campe.</p>
               <p>The French King in the meane time cauſed ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to be raiſed, as a more puiſſant had not beene ſeene in <hi>Fraunce</hi> of many yeeres.

Amongſt other priſoners the Conſtable was one, whome with the reſt which were taken in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the King of <hi>England</hi> afterwards bought of him that took them for twentie thouſand crownes. The Engliſhmen

marching ſtill forward, paſſed ouer the riuer <hi>Seane</hi> towards <hi>Roane,</hi> and their light horſmen ſcoured the country euen vnto the Suburbes of <hi>Paris:</hi> where encountring the townſmen of <hi>Amience</hi> well appointed, poſting towardes <hi>Paris</hi> vppon commaundement from the King, becauſe of long time before they had been charged with no ſeruice for the warres, they let fiercely vpon them, and bereft them of their carriage.</p>
               <p>The French King in the meane while (notwithſtanding the Pariſians earneſt ſute to the contrary) departed from <hi>Paris</hi> to Saint <hi>Dennis,</hi> whither as then the reſt of the Peeres were aſſembled. From thence purſuing his enemie with a certaine vehement and wonderfull deſire to fight, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued to <hi>Amience.</hi> The King of <hi>England</hi> aſſayed to paſſe his armie ouer the riuer <hi>Some,</hi> but there was neither foord knowne, nor bridge poſſible to be taken, they were all ſo ſurely garded by the French men. At length after procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of enlargement and reward to any French priſoner that ſhould performe it, a certaine young man taken by chaunce, diſcouered a forde. The French men ſuſpecting they would paſſe ouer at the ſame place, oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſtrongly againſt them, and entertained them in the riuer with a ſharpe skirmiſh.

The King of <hi>England</hi> cauſed the dead bodies of the French men to be numbred, and there were found ſlaine, eleven Princes, foureſcore Barons, twelue hundreth Knights, and about thirtie thowſand others. By commaundement from the King, all the noble men were buried in the villages neere adioyning, and three daies truce was graunted to giue bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall to their dead.</p>
               <p>After the King of <hi>England</hi> had obtained this notable victorie, he tooke his way directly towards <hi>Calice,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironning <note place="margin">

Before this aduertiſement came to the Army, there was another battell fought betweene the French and the Engliſh: wherein was preſent <hi>Phillip</hi> ſon to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who falling with his horſe ſoone after departed this life.

Meanes were found by the Flemminges to conuey the Earle from the French King, and he returned into <hi>Flaunders</hi> in hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his Fathers poſſeſſion. The King of <hi>England</hi> in the meane while was nothing ſlacke in ſoliciting his ſute with the Lordes of <hi>Flaunders.</hi> By them the matter was moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and the match profered to young <hi>Lewis.</hi> But he vtterly refuſed it, proteſting that he would neuer marrie the daughter of him that had ſlaine his Father.

               <p>In the meane time the King of <hi>England</hi> preſted the town of <hi>Calice</hi> with great vehemency, and the French King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to raiſe his ſiege, levied a mighty army.

Item, that the king of <hi>Fraunce</hi> ſhould renounce his title to all theſe, and releaſe all fealtie and right, which he, his heires or ſucceſſors might by any meanes clayme therein, &amp; that the king of <hi>England</hi> ſhould hold them all frankly and freely without acknowledgment of any homage or ſuperiority to the king of <hi>Fraunce</hi> or his ſucceſſors in that behalfe.

                  </p>
                  <p>Immediately vpon his returne, he directed forth letters to all his officers, Lievetenants, and Captaines, to avoyd out of all ſuch Townes, Caſtles and holds, as hee had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted withall to the King of <hi>England.</hi> But it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to report, with what vnwillingneſſe they all for the moſt part obayed this commandement: for it ſeemed a very ſtrange and difficult matter for them to vndergoe the yoke and ſubiection of the Engliſh. But the French King beeing a iuſt and vertuous Prince, would for no reſpect infringe his oath, or ſwarue from his covenants. Therfore he gaue commaund that all things ſhould bee performed according to the expreſſe tenor of the agreement. In like manner the King of <hi>England</hi> ſent commiſſioners to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againe certaine Caſtles and holdes taken in the warres into the French kings poſſeſſion. When the townes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes were in this ſort delivered, the ſoldiers which had now accuſtomed themſelues ſo long time together to liue vpon ſpoyle and pillage, conſidering that in regard of the wicked acts they had formerly committed, it would bee little for their profit, and leſſe for their ſafetie to returne home againe, determined from thenceforth to ſeeke their fortunes. And thereupon aſſembling themſelues together, they ranged through <hi>Champaine</hi> and the places adioyning, waſting and deſtroying all things before them, and as it commonly falleth out, their number daily encreaſed. The French king beeing informed of their miſchieuous proceedings, ſent <hi>Iaques</hi> of <hi>Burbon</hi> againſt them with an armie. He found them encamped vppon a very high hill, the ſcituation wherof was ſuch that it was impoſſible to take any perfect view of their forces: &amp; being indeed ſome ſixteen thouſand, they appeared to his ſcouts not aboue 5000. When it came to the encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter, it was fiercely fought
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:5967:19"/>
on both ſides, but fortune inclined to the worſer party. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gallant gentlemen periſhed in this conflict: the Duke of <hi>Burbon</hi> himſelfe with <hi>Peter</hi> his eldeſt Son were verie ſore wounded, and being conveyed to <hi>Lyons,</hi> died within three daies after. When theſe villaines had obtained this vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, they tooke their waie directly towards <hi>Avinion;</hi> at whoſe approche the Pope and his colledge of Cardinals were not a little affrighted, for ſuch was both their courage and their crueltie, that no man durſt oppoſe himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Neuertheleſſe the Pope and his Cardinalls being thus driuen to their ſhifts, and hauing no other meanes to repreſſe this mutinous multitude, to whome no miſchiefe came amiſſe, commaunded a croyſie to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched againſt them, with a graunt of cleere remiſſion of all their ſinnes which tooke it vppon them. Many aſſembled, but when there was no mention of pay, they ſhrunke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way euery one. The very ſame time the <hi>Marques</hi> of <hi>Mountferrat</hi> made warre vppon the Duke of <hi>Millaine.</hi> The Pope therefore practiſed with him to lead away this rebellious rebell into <hi>Lumbardie.</hi> And euen ſo it fell out, for when the Pope and Cardinalls had paied them three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore thouſand crownes, and that the <hi>Marques</hi> alſo had promiſed them entertainment beſides, they followed him and did him good ſeruice in his warres.</p>

Wherevppon the french King with a great part of his nobility, tooke vpon them the ſigne of the croſſe. Afterward the King of <hi>Ciprus</hi> trauelled into <hi>Bohemia</hi> to the Emperour, and from thence through <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante, Brabant,</hi> and <hi>Flaunders,</hi> he came into <hi>England,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the like petition to King <hi>Edward,</hi> but he honourably excuſed himſelfe.

                  </p>
                  <p>The noble men that were left in hoſtage for the french King, began to grow diſcontented for the long reſtraint of their liberty, and king <hi>Edward</hi> being of a gentle and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition, had giuen them leaue to go ouer to <hi>Calice,</hi> as well to recreate and refreſh their mindes, as alſo that from thence (being ſo neere <hi>Fraunce)</hi> they might the more commodiouſly diſpoſe of their affaires in their owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.

                  <p>The french King had a mervailous deſire to ſee the King of <hi>England</hi> againe, becauſe he had ſo honourably entreated him whilſte he was his priſoner.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:5967:23"/>
came to hand-ſtrokes: and the French men fought valiantly, inſomuch that they chaſed their enemies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto the towne: but by reaſon of the freſh ſupplies comming continually to their reſcue, in the end the French men were ouerthrowne, and the greater part of them ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlaine or taken priſoners.

                  <p>The prince of <hi>Wales</hi> becauſe he was loth to burden the people of <hi>Aquitaine</hi> with exactions for the maintenance of his ſoldiers, borrowed no ſmall ſome of money of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; beſides that conuerted all his plate both gold and ſiluer into coyne.</p>
                  <p>Many priſoners (as the cuſtome is) were diſcharged v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their worde; ſo was the Earle of <hi>Provence.</hi> But Pope <hi>

                  <p>Before the Prince ſet out from <hi>Burdeaux</hi> he had a ſonne borne, to whom the baniſhed King of <hi>Maiorica</hi> was god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father. <note place="margin">The birth of King <hi>Richard</hi> 2.</note> He was named Richard, and afterward came to be king of <hi>England, Edward</hi> the Princes elder ſonne being dead before his father.</p>

The Prince marched with his army in three battels, one following another, the vauntgard was conducted by the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ſent lately from the King of <hi>England</hi> to aſſiſt him, the King of <hi>Maiorica</hi> had the leading of the rereward, and he himſelfe accompanied with the tyrant marched in the maine battell. As they paſſed through <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> the King himſelfe for their better direction became their guide, and bare them company through a great part of his country. At <hi>Pampelone</hi> alſo (which is the chiefe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Navarre,)</hi> he entertayned the Prince with a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. Many feared that the armies ſhould haue been ſtay'd aſſoone as they came within his kingdome, but contrarie to their opinion, the King ſtill perſevered in peace and friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> hauing advertiſement of the army com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming againſt him out of <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> levyed forces in <hi>Spaine</hi> to the number of threſcore thouſand fighting men. For he was exceedingly beloued, and every man was willing to vndergo any danger for his ſake. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſent an herault with letters to the Prince, deſiring to know what the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was that he vndertooke theſe warres againſt him, ſeing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:5967:24"/>
that for his parte he had neuer offered him any manner of offence or iniury. The Prince vpon deliberation with his councell detained the meſſenger, and marching ſtill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, arriued at a towne called <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictoria,</hi> nere vnto which, both himſelfe and his aduerſarie encamped with their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The king of <hi>Spaine</hi> had three thouſand ſoldiers ſent to his ayd out of <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Engliſhmen had planted themſelues vppon a hill. Counſell was giuen to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> that if he purpoſed to winne the victorie without ſlaughter and bloudſhed, he ſhould need to take no other courſe, but only to ſhutte vp the wayes that no prouiſion of victuall might be conveyd to his enemie. For the Engliſhmen were encloſed as in a ſtreight, &amp; with ſmall labour all paſſage might eaſily haue beene intercepted. But the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> deſirous to fight, in regard of the greatneſſe of his forces which were now growne to aboue an hundred thouſand (for their number daily encreaſed) choſe rather to abide the tryall of battaile.</p>
                  <p>When the Prince had reſted ſome fewe dayes in that place, becauſe of the barrennes thereof he diſlodged from thence, and encamped in another ground more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And being not far diſtant from his enemie, he ſent backe the meſſenger, whom he had now detayned almoſt three weekes, with letters to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning briefly this anſwere: that, for reſpects of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance he was come to ſuccour the baniſhed King, that he would willingly compound the difference betweene them, but vpon no other termes then that King <hi>Henry</hi> ſhould renounce the title and reſigne the gouernment of that kingdome, whereto he could pretend no lawfull inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: and if this were refuſed, that he ſhould finde him prepared as well the one way, as the other.</p>
                  <p>We ſhewed you before in what manner the Engliſhmen ordered their battells. The ſpaniards in like ſort divided their whole power into three parts. The firſt was led by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:5967:25"/>
a certaine French Captaine of great eſteeme, and in it were about foure thouſand men. The ſecond was commanded by the two brothers of King <hi>Henry,</hi> and it contained ſome fiue and twenty thouſand, horſe and foote. The third by King <hi>Henry</hi> himſelfe, and his battell far exceeded both the other in number, as hauing in it ſeaven thouſand horſe, and threſcore thouſand footemen, whereof a great part were armed with croſſebowes. The field was pitcht be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Navarre</hi> and the towne of <hi>Navarette.</hi> Seldome or neuer hath any battell beene fought with greater fury and violence. The ſpaniards vſed ſlings, whoſe force was ſuch that therewith they pierced the helmets of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſurely a cruell kinde of fight. On the other ſide the Engliſhmen being moſt expert arches, ouer whelmed them with the multitude of their ſhot. One of king <hi>Henries</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (which as we told you had the leading of the vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard) aſſoone as he ſawe the Princes colors aduance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, departed out of the battell, and neuer ſtrooke ſtroke againſt the enemie. His example much diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a great many of the reſt. But King <hi>Henry</hi> himſelfe whereſoeuer he ſawe his men fainte or go by the worſe, preaſſed in thither, calling earneſtly vppon them, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and encouraging them, and often putting them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance both of his honour and their duty: in ſo much that thriſe in that one day did his veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t acclamations adde new life to his ſouldiers courage, and thriſe reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them from flying, when they were euen betaking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to flight. Neyther did the common ſoldiers onely, exerciſe their weapons that day, but the Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo, laying hand to their ſwords, made honourable proofe of their particular valour. The depoſed Tyrant ſought by all meanes he could to haue encountred King <hi>Henry.</hi> The fight continued for a time very vehement &amp; cruell, the ſoldiers on either part well expreſſing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilitie of their affection by the violence of their actions: but at length the Spaniards vnable to withſtand the vnited for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:5967:25"/>
of the Engliſhmen and Gaſcones, gaue themſelues to flight, neither could king <hi>Henry</hi> by his authoritie or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion <note place="margin">Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> victorie againſt <hi>Henry</hi> king of <hi>Caſtile</hi>
                     </note> cauſe them to turne head againſt their enemies. So that perceiving himſelfe to be more and more abandoned of his people, he was conſtrayned to fly alſo: for he made no queſtion at all that he ſhould be put to death if he had beene taken priſoner in the battell. The Engliſhmen pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the chace &amp; meruaillous deſtruction was made part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe that were ſlaine partly of thoſe that-periſhed in a certaine notable river thereby, whereinto they choſe rather to caſt themſelues hedlong, then to come alive into the hands of their enemies. When the chace was ended, a generall view was taken of the dead bodies, and there were found ſlaine, little leſſe then ſix hundreth horſemen, and almoſt ſeaven thouſand footmen, not accounting them that were killed at the bridge or drowned in the Riuer. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this battell the Princes came together to <hi>Burgis</hi> (a towne of <hi>Spaine)</hi> and thither reſorted all the Nobilitie of the country, from <hi>Toledo,</hi> from <hi>Liſbone,</hi> from <hi>Gallicta,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Theſe things diſpatched, Prince <hi>Edward</hi> delt with the Tyrant to provide money for the payment of his ſoldiers, by whoſe helpe he had recovered his kingdome: wherev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Don <hi>Pietro</hi> tooke his iourney into <hi>Sivill,</hi> there to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy mony for that purpoſe, pretending to returne within fewe weekes after, and to give ſatisfaction to all men. For at ſuch time as he was driven out of <hi>Caſtle,</hi> &amp; came firſt to <hi>Burdeaux</hi> to implore the Princes ayd, as we haue formerly declared, hee made faithfull promiſe, that aſſoone as he ſhould be reſtored to his kingdome, he wold giue liberall contentment to all that ſerued in his quarell: and to the ſame effect became bound to the Prince, that ſo the Prince might be his ſurety to the Captaines and

gentlemen that were readie to vndertake the enterpriſe in <note place="margin">The ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Tyrant.</note> his behalfe. At his departing towards <hi>Sivill,</hi> he made certaine appointment with the Prince, and gaue him his faith to returne verie ſhortly againe, and to bring mony with him for the diſcharge of his ſoldiers. When the prince vppon expectation of his returne, had taryed certaine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths beyond the time prefixed, he ſent meſſengers to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the cauſe of his delay. The tyrant excuſed himſelf, how he had ſent certaine of his ſervants with the mony, &amp; that they were intercepted in the way by theeves. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he requeſted him to returne into his owne country, &amp; leave ſome officers of his in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> to whome he would make ſatisfaction to the vttermoſt. This anſwere greatly diſpleaſed the Prince, but no other at that time could be obtayned.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> eſcaping out of the battell, fled to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia</hi> a cittie of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and there acquainted the king with his calamitie. From thence he went to <hi>Mountpelier</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Aniow,</hi> a mortall enemy of the Engliſh. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, he tooke his iourney to <hi>Avinion</hi> to Pope <hi>

At laſt being privately ayded, by the Duke of <hi>Aniow,</hi> he aſſembled certaine forces, and invaded Prince <hi>Edwards</hi> dominions. The Princeſſe ſomewhat amazed with the ſuddainneſſe thereof, ſent to the French King to repreſſe her enemie. But the French King win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at the matter.

                  <p>The french King publiſhed his cauſe and the neceſſity of this warre in diuers places by cunning perſons, with ſo well ſeeming circumſtances, as no man could otherwiſe iudge, but that his proceedinges were grounded vppon moſt iuſt and reaſonable occaſions.

                     <hi>Lewis</hi> Earle of <hi>Flaunders</hi> had no iſſue but one daughter: The King of <hi>England</hi> ſought by all meanes to haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her in marriage for his youngeſt Sonne, and the matter was laboured for the ſpace of three whole yeeres together. In the Earle himſelfe was no want of good affection: but Pope <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbane</hi> in regard they were of his kinred, would in no wiſe giue his conſent to the marriage. The Earle ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perceiving this match might not go forward, began to make meanes by his friends to <hi>Phillip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> the French kings brother, that the marriage might be made betweene him and his daughter.

                  <p>My author reporteth that a certaine Engliſh captaine, a man of approoved valour and diſcretion and withall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fortunate in his affayres, hauing one day obſerved a faire oportunitie, would haue attempted ſome exploit vppon the enemy: and to the intent the better to effect his purpoſe, had requeſted an Engliſh Earle to guard him with certaine horſemen for the performance of his enterpriſe. Which when the Earle had condiſcended vnto, ſome followers of his gaue him counſell to the contrary, perſwading him that if the adventure prooved ſuccesfull, the reputation thereof would redownd to another, and therefore that it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him to vndertake ſome ſervice by himſelfe, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour where of might be entirely his owne.

                  <p>Theſe letters were publiſhed in divers places of <hi>Gaſcoine,</hi> but they wrought ſmall effect, for many were ſeen daily to forſake the Prince, and to reſort to the French King not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding: whereby it appeared plainely, that no vertue hath more force to hold the hearts of men in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then affability.

                  <p>We haue formerly made mention of the King of <hi>Maio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> who in hope to be revenged of the diſgrace and iniury done vnto him, had for a time depended vppon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promiſe of Prince <hi>Edward</hi> to ayd him againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> then confederate with the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.

full on all ſides.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate. The Spanyard performed the part of a friend, &amp; ſent 40 great Ships with thirteene others of leſſe receyt, well appointed to meete with the Engliſh men in their paſſage. Not farre from <hi>Rochell</hi> the Spaniſh fleete en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred the Engliſh with great violence, and the fight <note place="margin">1372.</note> continued almoſt a whole day without intermiſſion.

The next day they renewed their fight afreſh, and it was maintained with as great reſolution as ever was any. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, in the end the Spaniards obtayned victory, by reaſon that both in number of men and ſhipping, and in the greatneſſe of their veſſells alſo they much overmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Engliſh.

                  </p>
                  <p>This good ſucceſſe of the French kings affaires both by the Spanyards and by <hi>Ivan,</hi> gave him occaſion to thinke that the reſt of the Engliſh provinces, would eaſily be brought to revolte; eſpecially if the Engliſh men ſhould receive but another overthrowe, or at leaſtwiſe be put to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extraordinary trouble or moleſtation. Herevpon he ſent the conſtable, with a great power of the chiefeſt peeres of his kingdome, to renewe the warres againe in his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies countries. Aſſoone as they came into the territory of <hi>Poytiers,</hi> all the townes and caſtles thereabout rendred themſelues into their ſubiection.

which towne notwithſtanding ſuſtained no damage at their hands, becauſe the towneſmen hated the Engliſh, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by all meanes to be againe vnder the French Kings government. They had long ſince freed themſelves from their forced ſubiection, but that the Engliſh garriſon which kept the caſtle, held them alwaies in ſuch awe as they durſt never venter to put their purpoſe in execution. At length contriving a ſtratageme politick enough for the time; vnder pretence of taking a generall muſter as well of the towneſmen, as of the garriſon, they allured the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine (who was a man of no great forecaſte) with all his company out of the hold. Which done, forthwith a great number of the towneſmen, breaking out from an ambuſh, gaue aſſault to the forte and ſuddenly ſurpriſed it, thoſe fewe which made reſiſtance being eaſily repreſſed. The noble men of <hi>Fraunce</hi> were at the ſame time aſſembled at <hi>Poytiers,</hi> and having intelligence hereof, were deſirous to be received by the <hi>Rochellers</hi> into their towne. Wherevnto they condiſcended, but vppon certaine conditions which were theſe. 1. That it ſhould be lawfull for the men of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell</hi> vtterly to race their Caſtle, out of which they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten received ſo great diſpleaſure, and to lay it levell with the <note place="margin">Rochell yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the French.</note> ground: 2, That the French men ſhould ſolemnely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe neverto erecte any caſtle there againe: 3, And that <hi>Rochell</hi> from thenceforth ſhould perpetually remaine a member of the crowne of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and never be alyenated to any other Lord, by any poſſible meanes that might be deviſed according as times and ſtates ſhould happen to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter afterward.

adioyning, not without ſome helpe and furtherance from the Britons, who were exceedingly inclined to the French King, though their Lord wholly favoured the King of <hi>England,</hi> as by whoſe meanes he had obtayned his Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

               <p>Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> in time paſt had made a ſolemne vow, that if euer he attained to the Papacy, he would neuer keepe his reſidence any other where then are <hi>Rome.</hi> This was very offenſiue to ſome of the Cardinals which bare ſcarce good affection to the Romaines: and it was nothing pleaſing

to the french King, who was deſirous to haue had the Pope his neerer neighbour. Therefore he ſent his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Duke of <hi>Aniow</hi> to <hi>Avinion</hi> to perſwade with him, but he was not able to diuert him from his purpoſe. So he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> the place he deſired, and within a while after there ended his life. When the Cardinals as the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome is were aſſembled together for the election of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the people of <hi>Rome</hi> began to make great tumult in the court, threatning violent effects of their diſpleaſure, if they made choyce of any other to be Pope, then ſuch a one <note place="margin">Great tumult about the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of a Pope.</note> as was both by birth and anceſtors a Romaine: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall ruſhing in amongſt the Cardinals, and with their fury interrupting their buſineſſe, it came to paſſe by meanes of this diſturbance, that one was choſen for Pope which was 100 yeeres old.

               <p>About the ſame time dyed the Queene of <hi>Navarre</hi> the french kings ſiſter, and by her deceaſe a certaine ſeigniory in <hi>Normandy</hi> fell to <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> the King of <hi>Nauarres</hi> ſonnes, which were brought vp in the french Court. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny counſelled the french King to ſeize into his hands all the King of <hi>Navarres</hi> poſſeſſions in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and to hold the ſame till his ſonnes were come of age. The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> miſtruſting as much, requeſted to haue his Sonnes ſent home, pretending that he was purpoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the elder of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in marriage with the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> daughter. Anſwere was returned by the french King, that his ſonnes could not be in a better or more honourable

This anſwere was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in diſpleaſure by the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon fortified thoſe places of <hi>Normondy</hi> againſt the force of the french men. Many important occaſions mooued the french King to conceiue offence againſt the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> but eſpecially that matter of poiſoning, which we told you before was confeſſed. Wherefore ſending an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt him, he ſubdued <hi>Mountpelier,</hi> and the country about it, which at that time were vnder the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarres</hi> ſubiection.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> being thus moleſted both vpon the frontiers of his owne kingdome, and in <hi>Normandy,</hi> (for the French King had ſent an army thither alſo) made requeſt to the King of <hi>England</hi> by ambaſſadours, that he might be receiued into his frendſhip.

That, if it ſhould happen the Engliſhmen to recouer any townes in theſe quarters from the french, then the King of <hi>England</hi> to haue the profits of the ſame, the propriety of the places remaining to the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> And this
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:5967:37"/>
eſpecially was moſt acceptable to the Engliſh, becauſe from thence they might alwaies haue acceſſe into <hi>France</hi> at their pleaſure. It was further agreed, that the King of <hi>England</hi> ſhould immediatly ſend foure thouſand horſemen into <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> to be employed againſt the Spaniard, and that it ſhould not be lawfull for them to depart out of the King of <hi>Navarres</hi> ſeruice, till ſuch time as the warres were finiſhed.

But vpon the approche of a great number of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen comming by ſea, both the french men, and Britons (which ioyned to their ayd) were conſtrained to breake vp their campe and leaue their enterpriſe vnperformed.

               </p>
               <p>Amongſt other places, the Engliſh had beſieged a towne in <hi>Britaine</hi> called Saint <hi>Maloes,</hi> at that time in poſſeſſion <note place="margin">Saint <hi>Maloes</hi> beſieged.</note> of the french men.

Which when the towneſ-men perceiued, taking the aduantage of opportunity, one night very ſecretly they iſſued out of the towne, and whilſt their enemies kept negligent watch, brake vp the mines in ſuch ſort, that thoſe which laboured in the workes vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, were ouerwhelmed with the earth which they tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled vppon them. The Engliſh thus preuented, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of their purpoſe, thought it beſt for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe to returne into their couuntrey. Two of the King

The Engliſhmen and <hi>Nauarroys</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether purſued the Spaniards in their departure, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſacked certaine townes and villages vppon the frontiers. Wherewith the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> was ſo vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mooued, that he rayſed an army of ſome forty thouſand, in purpoſe to haue beſieged <hi>Tudell,</hi> the place where the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> wintered. But by mediation of good men, a meanes was found to make peace between them. Which was, that <hi>Charles</hi> the King of <hi>Nauarres</hi> ſon ſhould take to wife the King of Spaines daughter, and the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Sonne ſhould likewiſe marry the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarres</hi> daughter. This <hi>Charles</hi> (as we told you) had been detained certaine yeeres by the french King: but at ſuch time as this treaty of marriage tooke effect, vpon the king of Spaines requeſt, he was honourably ſent home to her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>The French king being a notable politicke Prince, and of great experience in matters of ſtate, to the intent he might more commodiouſly maintaine his warres againſt <note place="margin">Edmond <hi>of</hi> Langly.</note> the Engliſh, ſent an ambaſſadour into <hi>Scotland</hi> to retayne

This man arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by the way at <hi>Sluce</hi> in <hi>Flaunders</hi> from whence he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to haue proceeded on his iouruey, was by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of the towne brought before the Earle then remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at <hi>Bruges:</hi> where by occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſome vndiſcreet ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he was reprooued and ſharpely checkt with tearmes of reproch, both by the Earle of <hi>Flaunders</hi> himſelfe, and by the Duke of <hi>Britaine;</hi> inueying earneſtly againſt ſuch kind of perſons, as the chiefe cauſers of all diſſention and vnquietnes. There were others alſo which put him in feare that if he committed himſelfe to ſea, it was likely that the Engliſhmen lying in waight for ſuch oportunities, would intercept him in his paſſage. Here vppon altering his purpoſes he returned into <hi>Fraunce</hi> without diſpatch of his commiſſion: and vppon the report he made of theſe matters, the french King wrote very ſharpe letters to the Earle of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> exhorting and aduiſing him as he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his owne welfare, that he ſhould not foſter his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the Duke of Britaine.

Neuertheles the duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> ſhortly after of his owne accord departed into <hi>England,</hi> and the minds and affections of his people began to incline more fauourably towardes him then in former times they had done.</p>
               <p>It is declared before, how the Cardinals after the death of Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> to pacify the tumult of the Romanes, had through feare and compulſion choſen <hi>

               <p>When the French King vnderſtood that a newe Pope was created, he called a conuocation of certaine eſtates &amp; chiefly of diuines, demaunding their opinion whether of the two Popes ought in this diuerſitie to be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

The Lords of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualty with the Kings brothers, and many of the diuines, were of opinion that <hi>Cleoment</hi> ought to be receiued. This

But the King of <hi>Maiorica</hi> expecting I know not what greater helpes otherwhere, required ayde of Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the king of <hi>Englands</hi> ſonne, who indeede faithfully promiſed him what he was able to performe. Now during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, vppon theſe occaſions his wife ſent a meſſenger to the French King, requeſting him that out of his royall cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie he would be a meanes to procure her a match for her daughter, ſuch a one as both for the nobilitie of his birth and the worthineſſe of his perſon, were fitting for her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: to the intent that ſo ample &amp; rich poſſeſſions might not at any time fall into the hands of ſtraungers. The fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch king moued with her reaſonable petition, ſent a kinſman of of his, vnto whome ſhe willingly eſpouſed her daughter. The King of <hi>Maiorica</hi> as is ſhewed before, ended his life in the purſute of his enterpriſe: After his death the Queen marryed againe the fourth time. Whereat the King of <hi>Hungaries</hi> nephew named <hi>Charles,</hi> conceiuing great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, made warres vpon the new king, and beſieging him in a certaine caſtle vppon the ſea coaſt, at the winning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (which was by compoſition) he tooke both him and her priſoners, and with them alſo her daughter and her huſband, which vnfortunate payre it fortuned ſoone after to exchange this life for a better. The king and his wife were both releaſed, vppon condition that they ſhould ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render <hi>Apulia</hi> and <hi>Calabria.</hi> Which when <hi>Charles</hi> had once gotten into his poſſeſſion, thenceforth eſtabliſhing his eſtate, &amp; augmenting his puiſſance by ioyning in league with the princes round about him, he gaped alſo for the kingdomes of <hi>Naples, Sicill,</hi> and <hi>Province.</hi> The Queene therefore fearing, and in a manner foreſeeing that aſſoone as ſhe were dead, <hi>Charles</hi> would with all his forces inuade thoſe dominions, repayred to the Pope diſcourſing to him the whole ſtate of her affayres, and withall beſeeching him
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:5967:41"/>
that he would receiue her into his protection. Hereupon by a franke and free graunt, ſhe conueyed <hi>Naples, Sicill, Calabria, Apulia</hi> &amp; <hi>Province,</hi> abſolutely to the Pope, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow <note place="margin">The Queene of <hi>Naples</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyeth her inheritance to the Pope.</note> them all vppon whomſoeuer he pleaſed hereafter. The Pope accepted this donatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hers very thankfully, &amp; cauſed inſtruments of the ſame made in forme of lawe, to be publikely recorded. Not long after, the Pope at his comming to <hi>Auinion</hi> beſtowed all thoſe ſeignioryes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Duke of <hi>Aniow</hi> which came thither from <hi>Tholous</hi> to viſite him: and this graunt was confirmed to him and to his heyres for euer.</p>
               <p>The men of <hi>Bruges</hi> endeauoured with great labour and coſt to drawe the riuer <hi>Liſa</hi> from <hi>Gaunt</hi> to their towne; &amp; <note place="margin">The occaſion of the Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh warres.</note> for effecting thereof, kept well nere fiue hundreth men at worke. The <hi>Gauntoyes</hi> being certifyed of their proceedings, began to make ſome ſtirre and to ſhew themſelues diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the matter. There was at that time in <hi>Gaunt</hi> a meruailous factious fellowe and very popular, called <hi>Iohn Lyon,</hi> one that applyed his whole ſtudie and induſtry to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn Lyon</hi> a ſeditious fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in <hi>Gaunt,</hi> bringeth vp the faction of the white cappes.</note> the people againſt their Prince. His counſell being demaunded by the commons in this matter; with a ſet ſpeech and compoſed countenance, he made anſwere to this effect. That in truth this attempt of the men of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> was not to be tollerated, but withall, that an auncient cuſtome of the cittie (very laudable though at that time growne out of vſe) was neceſſary to be renued, namely, that all ſuch as were deſirous of the auncient libertie, ſhould we are white cappes. For (ſayd he) the <hi>Gauntoyes</hi> haue had many and thoſe very notable priueledges aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which by little and little were now worne out of date and vtterly extinguiſhed, to the great wrong &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of the citizens: and if they would be ſo contented ſtill, it would come to paſſe in the end, that euen thoſe that remayned ſhould be taken from them. That the cittie of <hi>Gaunt</hi> had in times paſt ſo flouriſhed that men of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count held themſelues well appayd, and thought no ſmall
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:5967:41"/>
honour if eyther by deſert, reward, or fauour they might obtaine to be made free denizens of the citty: but now the world was ſo chaunged, that no man (no not for benefite &amp; commoditie profered him) would much deſire to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into their ſocietie. With theſe and ſuch like ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches he exceedingly ſtirred vp their mindes, and eaſily drew the worſer ſorte of people to followe him. Euery man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke him to his white cap: and one day amongſt the reſt aſſembling themſelues together, they tooke armes &amp; went forth to deſtroy the labourers of <hi>Bruges.</hi> But they hauing incling thereof, left their worke vnfiniſhed, and prouided for their ſafety by flight. Another matter which greatly exaggerated their diſpleaſure, was this. The <hi>Gauntoys</hi> would haue had a towneſman of theirs ſet at liberty whom the Earle had cauſed to be apprehended: exclayming that therby their priuiledges were violated. And therfore when they had ſent their meſſenger to the Sheriffe, and could not obtaine his deliuerance, they made meanes to the Earle to get him releaſed. The Earle promiſed he would willingly afforde them that pleaſure, adding fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he would doe nothing whereby their liberties might any way be infringed, and moreouer that he would giue commandement to the men of <hi>Bruges</hi> wholy to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſſe from their attempted enterpriſe, and to fill vp all thoſe ditches which they had digged and cut out already. Deſiring onely in the meane time that they would leaue of that faſhion of wearing white cappes, as a thing that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred perpetuall matter of faction and ſedition. When this anſwere was brought to the <hi>Gauntoyes,</hi> it greatly alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated their affections from the Earle, eſpecially being ſo exaſperated and prouoked againſt him by <hi>Lyon</hi> the author of this inſurrection: who perſwaded them confidently that if this cuſtome might be abolliſhed, it were the next way to reduce them againe into their old ſubiection and ſeruitude. Now although the Earle of <hi>Flaunders</hi> entreated his people faire to lay aſide their cappes, yet neuertheleſſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:5967:42"/>
he ſent ſome two hundred men to haue entred vnlookt for into the citie, who ſurpriſing <hi>Lyon</hi> and certaine others, ſhould haue conveyd them from the people, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to priſon. But this matter could not be ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly handled, but <hi>Lyon</hi> gat knowledge thereof, and had leaſure both to call the people together and to exhort them with vehement perſwaſions, that if euer they would fight for the maintenance of their liberty, they ſhould now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently make proofe of their valour. Hereupon hauing ſome fower hundred of his faction about him, he proceeded to the market place: where encountring the gouernor of the towne, he ſnatcht the Earles enſigne out of his hands, and tearing it in peaces, trode it vnder his feete, killing the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor himſelfe from whome he tooke it. What ſhould I tell you, how mightily the Earles patience was moued with this villany? The citizens &amp; twownedwellers which were of honeſter mindes and better diſcretion, foreſeing that all things tended to a ſorrowfull iſſue, conſulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues, and ſent certaine of their principall men to make ſute to the Earle for pardon of their offence. The Earle at the firſt receyued them ſomwhat roughly, but afterward leaſt by ſeueritie out of ſeaſon the miſchiefe might haue growne greater, he was content to remit the rigour of his diſpleaſure. Whilſt thoſe men trauelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the common benefite, <hi>Lyon</hi> who ſought nothing but trouble and diſturbance, to the intent he might know the certaine number of his followers, muſtred them without the towne, and found them to be almoſt ten thowſand. Then ſpeaking to them in open audience many and diuerſe things concerning the maintenance of their liberty, he gaue them counſell to pull downe a certaine caſtle (which the Earle had lately builded) becauſe from thence the citty might be much annoyed: and it was no hard matter to perſwade his ſeditious multitude. So they eaſily wan it hauing no garriſon to defend it, and when they had ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, it they ſet it on fire: <hi>Lyon</hi> in the meane time making
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:5967:42"/>
ſhowe as if he had beene ſorrie for the fact, pretending that it happened by miſchaunce, whereas in trueth it was committed of meere malice and ſet purpoſe. Theſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings ſo troubled the Earle, that he would not endure to heare the meſſengers of the people ſpeak crauing pardon for this offence, as they had done for the other, but there threatned them to puniſhment as the fact deſerued. For he had beſtowed a great ſome of money about the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this caſtle, beſides the reproachfulnes of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherewith his noble ſpirit was much more prouoked then by any other occcaſion. The Earle made greuous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnt amongſt a great company of noblemen &amp; knights aſſembled at <hi>Liſle</hi> in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> of the intollerable pride of his rebellious ſubiects, and of the vnworthy iniu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ies they had offered him; wherewith he ſo moued their affections, that they all with one conſent promiſed him their vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſtayd and furtherance, and to be ready prepared for any ſeruice wherein he would employ them. Herevpon ſoldiers were forthwith placed in garriſons and warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne; the very originall whereof, is the ſame which wee haue already diſcourſed.</p>
               <p>When the Earles minde was thus incenſed againſt the Flemmings, <hi>Lyon</hi> hauing thereby gotten greater oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, after he had in open aſſembly ſlaunderouſly inveyed againſt the cruelty and obſtinate wilfulneſſe of the aduerſe party, and vnder that pretext perſwaded the people that it was very neceſſarie to procure their neighbours to ioyne with them in league and confederacie, he againe muſtered his ſouldiers by the poule, and found them to be nerehand twelue thouſand. Amongſt others which followed his faction, were the men of a certaine towne called <hi>Damme:</hi> in which towne ſhortly after <hi>Lyon</hi> dyed very ſuddainly, not without ſuſpition of poyſoning. The men of <hi>Ipre</hi> were <note place="margin">The death of <hi>Lon.</hi>
                  </note> likewiſe of his confederacy, into which towne the rebells entring by permiſſion of the commons, ſlue certaine gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that lay therein garriſon. After <hi>Lyon</hi> was dead,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:5967:43"/>
the <hi>Gantoyes</hi> created them newe captaines, and being aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by the men of <hi>Bruges</hi> and many other townes which tooke their parte, their number encreaſing to an infinite multitude, they beſieged (a long while to little purpoſe) <note place="margin">The Earle of <hi>Flaunders</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by his ſubiects.</note> the Caſtle of <hi>Teremund,</hi> wherein the Earle of <hi>Flaunders</hi> at that time remayned. Wherefore rayſing their ſiege and ioyning thoſe forces to the reſt of their army, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded forward to the towne of <hi>Arde,</hi> which they ſtreytly beleagered, and the towneſmen as ſtoutly defended. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, when no way could be deuiſed to bring vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall to the beſieged, the Earle foreſeing that the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof in concluſion would force them to yeeld, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſecretly that ſome conditions of peace might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured betweene them. Hereunto alſo his mother the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Artoyes</hi> was meruailouſly inclined: who but lately before addreſſing moſt friendly letters to the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> (which had marryed the Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> daughter) earneſtly beſought him that he would employ his diligent endeauour to bring this matter of agrement to effecte. For the accompliſhment whereof a treaty being had at <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> after fifteene dayes ſpent in debating of diuerſe matters (the <hi>Gauntoyes</hi> in that while ſhewing themſelues very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant &amp; luſty) at length it was concluded to this purpoſe. That the <hi>Gantoyes</hi> ſhould breake vp their ſiege before <hi>Ard,</hi> and within one yeare next enſuing reedify the caſtle which they had lately raced: and that the Earle laying aſide all memory of former diſpleaſures, ſhould come and make his reſidence at <hi>Gaunt.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> becauſe he was loth by his long ſoiourning with the Earle of <hi>Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> to procure him the French Kings diſpleaſure, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from thence (as I tolde you before) into <hi>England.</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his continuance there, he receiued verie comfortable <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth into his country.</note> letters from almoſt all the ſtates of his countrie, ſolliciting his returne home againe: wherupon by the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> aduiſe he returned, but not without Engliſh ayd for his better aſſurance and ſafety.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:5967:43"/>
When the Earle of <hi>Flaunders</hi> according to his former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, was come to <hi>Gaunt,</hi> he made an eloquent orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before all the people, wherein he at large declared his good affection, (by the way lightly glauncing at their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude) and withall (doing the office of a gracious Prince) exhorted them, from thencefoorth to maintaine peace and tranquility in the common wealth. For his part, proteſting that he would ſo order all his affaires, as no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of trouble ſhould any way be deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. Onely this he requeſted with great earneſtnes at their hands, that they would forbeare that faſhion of wearing white cappes, and cauſe the cuſtome thereof to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. To all the reſt of his ſpeech they gaue quiet atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but aſſoone as he talked of laying aſide their cappes, yee might haue ſeene the colours and countenances of moſt of them changed. The Earle (as it is likely) percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their mindes, and conſidering with himſelfe that the ſeedes of diſcord were generally diſperſed amongſt them, diſmiſſed his audience and departed out of <hi>Gaunt.</hi> This was a pleaſant ſpectacle to the ſeditious, but the honeſtly affected were greatly greeued that this priuate grudge and inward debate ſhould thus be more and more augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>After the Earle of <hi>Flaunders</hi> had forſaken the towne of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> a certaine gentleman mooued with deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge for the death of the gouernour his kinſeman lately murthered by the rebelles, made defiance to the <hi>Gauntoys,</hi> &amp; by occaſion ſet vpon certain marchants as they were ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vp the riuer of <hi>Skeld</hi> with corne for prouiſion of the towne. He tooke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and cut off their hands &amp; put out their eyes: which fact of his was generally interpreted by townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as done by the Earles direction. The ſeditious ſort, as if hereby a gap had been opened to doe what miſchiefe they liſted, aſſembled to the number of fiue thouſand men, and ſuddainely ſurpriſed <hi>Arde,</hi> (which at that time was vnfurniſht for defence, expecting no daunger in regard
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:5967:44"/>
the peace was ſo lately concluded) and when they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, beat down certaine gates and towers, and that part of the wall which looked towards <hi>Gaunt.</hi> Then the Earle being as it were ouercome, and vanquiſhed with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable outrage, after he had by his meſſengers directed into the Citie, layed open in plaine tearmes before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, both their wicked proceedings, and his patient for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, proclaymed open warres and vtter enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
               <p>In the meane ſeaſon thoſe citizens which were deſirous of peace, perſwaded and preuailed with the reſt, that to mittigate the Earles diſpleaſure, they ſhould make reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the towne they had taken, and baniſh certaine of the chiefe authors of the enterpriſe. This thing gaue the Earle ſome ſatisfaction. And for example ſake, he put to death certaine commoners of the towne of <hi>Ipre,</hi> which had been chiefe moouers of the late inſurrection. Vpon the report whereof, the rebels and ring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore following the counſell of one of their own ſtampe (who was of opinion that liberty could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, but by ſubuerſion of the nobilitie and gentlemens eſtates) they ouerthrew and beat downe all the Caſtles and gentlemens houſes they could come to, and rifling their goods, diuided the ſpoile amongſt them. The gentlemen mooued with this violent iniury, and increaſed in number by the loſſe of their ſubſtance, vppon complaint to the Earle, obtained his licence and with ſuch power as they procured, made cruell warres vppon the <hi>Gauntoys.</hi> Who fearing leaſt the Earle ſhould procure ayd out of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> they ſent meſſengers afore hand to the French King, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him that he would not take armes againſt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth; affirming that they contended with their Lord and endured the diſcommodities of warre, not vppon any wilfull obſtinacy, but in deſire to maintaine their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The french King being already ſcarce well pleaſed with

Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I haue often and very much conſidered with my ſelfe, by what occaſions ſuch things ſhould come to paſſe. For at this preſent through the diuine fauour, ye haue a ſtate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable quiet and ſetled. Of <hi>Flaunders</hi> I know not what to thinke: the Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> is ſubtill, a friend to the Engliſh, an enemy to vs: therefore it is behoouefull that ye retaine the cheefe Cities of <hi>Britaine</hi> in loue and amitie, for by this meanes ſhall the Dukes counſelles be fruſtrate. Surely the Britons deſerue to be commended, and are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be well eſteemed: for they haue alwaies done me faithfull ſeruice, both in defending my kingdome, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing my enemies. Send into Germanie, to prouide a wife for my ſonne in thoſe quarters, that by ſuch meanes the bond of league and frendſhippe betwixt vs may be more ſtrongly combined. Ye haue heard how the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> takes the ſame courſe, and ſeekes a wife from thence, that he may ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh his affaires by ſuch alliance. This realme of ours (as we ſee) is much diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, and ſuffereth many diſpleaſures by the Engliſh: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you endeuor to take away all ſuch occaſions of warre and enmity. For howſoeuer I may ſeeme to haue nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed warres, yet in my heart I haue vtterly abhorred them, and the thought thereof at this preſent moues no ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morce in my conſcience. Theſe and many other things
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:5967:46"/>
were ſpoken by him to the like effect. The Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iow</hi> was abſent as I told you a little before, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by meſſengers that went and came, hee eaſily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how all things paſſed: and vppon aduertiſement from ſome of his frends remayning at the Court, he came to <hi>Paris</hi> the ſame day that the King ended his life. As <note place="margin">1380.</note> ſoone as he heard certainely that the King was dead, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently he ſeazed vpon all the kings apparell and iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elles and whatſoeuer elſe was there of worth or value. For at the ſame time he had determined vppon a iourney into <hi>Naples,</hi> towards the furniture whereof he had need of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch neceſſaries, eſpecially being ſo augmented in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as he was lately before by the gift of Pope <hi>Clement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now although it were appointed by the kings will who ſhould haue the adminiſtration of his goods, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the duke of <hi>Aniow</hi> took it vpon him, &amp; his brothers did not greatly gainſay him, peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture inreſpect he was their elder. Afterward it was decreed by the Peeres of the Realme, that ſo ſoone as the coronation of their new King were finiſhed, the gouernment of the ſtate ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his vncles, to remaine in their hands till the king <note place="margin">1380.</note> came to one and twentie yeares of age.

The young King was then twelue yeares old, he had one brother, and one ſiſter, both, by father and Mother; their names were <hi>Lewis,</hi> and <hi>Katherine.</hi> After theſe ſolemnities ended, great conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion was had about matters concerning the honour and fafety of the kingdome.

                  <p>IT is ſhewed before how the youngeſt ſonne of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> paſſed with his forces through <hi>Fraunce</hi> into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> to ayd the Duke: who albeit he were recalled by his ſubiects (as I told you) yet the King of <hi>Fraunce</hi> wrought ſo much by his policy that he found ſmall faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and but cold affection in many of them, eſpecially in the people of <hi>Nants</hi> and ſome others. When the duke <note place="margin">Thomas <hi>Earle of</hi> Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note> diſcourſed of his vnfortunate aduentures, and the ſubtilty of his enemies proceedings, the King of <hi>Englands</hi> ſonne alwaies comforted him and promiſed aſſurance of frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſuccour.

But they made him anſwere, that they would in no wiſe waſte their owne country for the Engliſhmens pleaſures, and that they would neuer take armes in his quarell ſo long as the Engliſhmen lingred in <hi>Britaine.</hi> This was the very occaſion and impediment which made him breake promiſe with the Engliſh. And the King of <hi>Englands</hi> ſonne meruailing what the matter meant, began to be ſomewhat offended, eſpecially becauſe there came no newes at all from the duke (the meſſengers which carried letters between them being indeed cut off by the way.) At length after long and dayly expectation when he had ſpent two moneths in the ſiege, finding that all he could do of himſelfe was but labour loſt, vnleſſe more forces came from his confederate, leauing his enterpriſe vnperformed, he himſelfe tooke his iourney to the duke, intending to know directly what was his purpoſe &amp; reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.

                  <p>During the time that <hi>Nants</hi> was beſieged, certaine noble men of <hi>Britaine</hi> of more eminent reſpect and authority then the reſt, had ſome communication with their Prince in theſe words, or the like. Sir, you ſufficiently declare and manifeſtly ſhew, that you are wholy addicted to the Engliſh nation. But what fruite or commodity, what honour or aduauncement, doe you expect from their friendſhip? what motiues induce you to obſerue them with ſuch affection? For when you haue brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into <hi>Britaine,</hi> they ſhall bereaue you of your goods, and diſpoſſeſſe you of your inheritance deſcended from your

aunceſtors, and this they will doe if euer they obtaine the vpper hand of the French men. Let the King of <hi>Nauarres</hi> example moue you: who in regard of the ſingular good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion he had conceiued of their faithfulnes, committed into their hands the towne and caſtle of <hi>Chirburg:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into being once admitted, they would neuer out of it but held it for euer after as their owne. By like occaſion, if through your ſufferance and fauour they be once receiued into our citties here, neuer perſwade your ſelfe that they will at any time forgoe them: for they may alwaies haue ayd out, of their owne country at pleaſure, whereby their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſhall be refreſhed, &amp; their forces renewed. We neede not ſeeke farre for a preſident: ſee you not how they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Breſt,</hi> a towne entirely of your owne ſeigniory and iuriſdiction? But when will they finde time to reſtore it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? aſſure your ſelfe for certainty they intend nothing leſſe. Let this therefore be your warning, and holde your ſelfe well appayd that you are beloued of your people, who are reſolutely of this minde and purpoſe, neuer to forſake the French king to pleaſure the Engliſh, will you for your wiues ſake, becauſe you haue marryed an Engliſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, take a courſe to ouerthrow your ſelfe and your eſtate? will you therefore aduenture the loſſe of ſo goodly and large an heritage, for the keeping whereof you haue ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayned ſo many perills and ſo great dangers? will you be at the charge to maintaine ſoldiers perpetually? what are you able to performe of your ſelfe, when your ſubiects ſhall forſake you, yea and take armes and fight againſt you alſo? But omitting all theſe reaſons and conſiderations: the French King is now dead which was ſo vehemently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt you, and in his place his ſonne ſucceded, who is yet very young and of no euill diſpoſition, we will apply our endeauours to reconcile you vnto him, that friendſhip and amity may be eſtabliſhed betweene yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Duke although he were much moued with this kinde of diſcourſe, yet diſſembled the matter for feare of giuing offence to the Engliſh. And the noble men which had giuen him this counſell, thinking it was no time to vſe longer delay, poſted ſecretly to the French King lying then at <hi>Paris,</hi> where declaring what had paſſed, they treated for peace. The Engliſh generall not knowing what was in hand, purpoſed againſt the next ſpring to haue had new ſupplies out of <hi>England,</hi> and to haue made ſharper warres in <hi>Fraunce</hi> then before. The French men themſelues mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted as much: foreſeeing that at one time or other ſome great miſchiefe would befall them from the Engliſh. The <hi>Britons</hi> which negotiated with the King for agreement, perceiuing that ſuch a matter was feared in <hi>Fraunce</hi> (like diſcrect commiſſioners who obſerue all things diligently in ſuch occaſions, and apply the ſame to their owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage) in their treaty of peace, did meruailouſly exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerate that point, and with great pollicy, inſomuch that by mentioning ſuch matters and caſting doubts thereupon, they had the French King farre eaſier to be delt with in all their affaires. The Duke of <hi>Aniow</hi> (as I told you) was chiefe in authoritie: who for that he was purpoſed ſhortly after to take his iourney into <hi>Calabria</hi> and the other prouinces which he had obtained in gift from the Pope, intended nothing leſſe then that <hi>Fraunce</hi> ſhould be troubled with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new warres, by occaſion whereof he might loſe the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of performing what he had before determined. Therefore accepting the counſell of the <hi>Briton</hi> commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo much rather for the doubts of future warre which they had ſuggeſted into his opinion, he willingly condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to the motion of agreement. So it was concluded, to this effect: that the Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> being receiued into <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the French king, forſaketh the Engliſh.</note> the French kings fauour, ſhould do homage to him for his Dukedome, with performance of all rights belonging to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:5967:48"/>
ſuch ceremonies. And further, to the intent that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh generall (who vpon the Dukes requeſt had trauelled ſuch an infinite compaſſe of ground to come to his ayd) might in ſome ſort be honourably ſatisfied, it was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Duke to furniſh him with ſhips and all other things neceſſary for the conueying of him and his people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into his country. The Engliſh generall ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thus deluded, and deceiued, would admit no excuſes, but full of indignation, hoyſed ſayles to the winde &amp; made homeward into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About this time the Earle of <hi>Flaunders</hi> was exceedingly incenſed againſt the <hi>Gauntoyes</hi> for their intollerable proud and arrogant demeanor. It happened the ſame time ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fortunately for him, that variance roſe amongſt the men of <hi>Bruges,</hi> betweene the Aldermen and the Commons: inſomuch that the magiſtrate wrote letters to the Earle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deſiring his preſence. Whereupon he came, and hauing put to death ſome fiue hundreth one &amp; other, he receiued the towne into his protection, with certain other of their neighbors which were deſirous of the like fauour. Being therefore emboldened by the acceſſion of theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he determined to chaſtice the men of <hi>Ipre,</hi> who had ſlaine certaine gentlemen of his houſhold, and receiued the <hi>Gauntoyes</hi> into their towne. At their requeſt, the <hi>Gaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toyes</hi> their confederates ſent three thouſand men to ayd them. The Earles army with the helpe of the men of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> amounted well nere to the number of twenty thouſand. The <hi>Gantoyes</hi> therefore augmented their power likewiſe by leuying nine thouſand more: and ſo proceeding ſome miles on their way, they ſent word to their fellowes, that they ſhould alſo bring forth their men into the field, that ſo with vnited forces they might ioyntly aſſayle their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. There came forth ſome eight thouſand, who when they had marched a while in order of battell, arriuing at a three-way leete, and conſulting among themſelues which way was to be taken, at length they followed the ſame
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:5967:49"/>
which was forelayd before by any ambuſh of the Earles ſouldiers: whereinto being once falne, before they could cleere themſelues from the daunger, and come to ioyne with their confederates, they loſt three thouſand of their men, the reſt hardly eſcaping by flight. The party which gaue them counſell to enter that paſſage, being accuſed of treaſon for his labour, was by the people in their furie and vprore admitting no excuſe, miſerably ſlaine and torne in peeces one limme from another, euery man ſnatching ſome part to wreake his particular malice. The vnhappy wretch (doubtleſſe) had this puniſhment vndeſerued: for had he committed ſuch a villany, ſurely he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue truſted himſelfe in their hands afterward.</p>
                  <p>After this good ſucceſſe, the Earle forthwith addreſſed himſelf to the ſiege of <hi>Ipre,</hi> now whilſt they were all in this feare &amp; perplexity. But the men of <hi>Ipre</hi> terrifyed with the late accident, ſubmitted themſelues to his mercy. Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into the towne, he put to death ſome 700 commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſent three hundreth or thereabouts of the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyer ſort, priſoners to <hi>Bruges.</hi> Many other townes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of <hi>Ipre,</hi> yeelded themſelues likewiſe to his obedience. The <hi>Gauntoyes</hi> therefore which now in a manner alone ſtood out againſt him, were beſieged, but it could not be done ſo ſtreytly, but that victuall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion might freely be conueyd into the towne at one gate or another. For the place is naturally very ſtrong, both in regard of the ground wherupon it is ſcituate, and the commoditie of two riuers called <hi>Skeld</hi> and <hi>Liſe</hi> running by it: therfore he had neede of a very populous army that ſhould enuiron it on all ſides. The towneſmen muſtered themſelues by poule, and there were found of ſuch as for their yeares were able to beare armes, to the number of foure ſcore thouſand. They ſo little eſteemed the ſiege that euen then whilſt their enemies lay before the cittie, they went forth and ſacked certaine townes of <hi>Flaunders.</hi> Amongſt others the men of <hi>Bruxelles</hi> fauoured them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:5967:49"/>
and the <hi>Liegeois</hi> alſo would ſurely haue ſent them ſuccour, but that the great diſtance betweene them was a hinderance to their purpoſe. The Earle perceiuing he did but loſe time and labour in beſieging <hi>Gaunt,</hi> for that the winter alſo approched, brake vp his ſiege &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed his army. In the beginning of the next ſpring he <note place="margin">1381.</note> leuyed ſome twenty thouſand men and beſieged <hi>Gawre.</hi> The captaine that lay there in garriſon deſired helpe of the <hi>Gauntoyes,</hi> and they preſently ſent a band of ſix thouſand: who falling by chaunce vppon ſome ſix hundreth ſoldiers of <hi>Arde,</hi> which vpon commandement were marching in great haſte towards the Earle, oppreſſed them with their multitude, and ſlue them euery one. Beſides this, one <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

                     <hi>de Bois</hi> a valiant fellowe, receiuing other ſix thouſand men of the <hi>Gauntoyes,</hi> had couenanted with him that went before to the reliefe of <hi>Gawre,</hi> that he ſhould not fight with the Earle, but ioyntly together with both their forces. But the other notwithſtanding, hearing that his enemy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched ready to giue battell, was ſo enflamed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of honor, that without further expecting the company of his aſſiſtant, though his owne power were far too weake for ſuch an encounter, yet he put his men in order againſt the enemy. The Earle diuided his battell into fiue ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, in euery of which were foure thouſand ſoldiers, and giuing charge vpon his enemies, albeit they valiantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelues, yet by reaſon of their ſmall number, vnable to ſuſtaine ſo great violence, he ſoone ouerthrew them and put them to flight. His horſemen purſued the chace with great cruelty: and when they had withdrawn themſelues for refuge into a certaine monaſtery therby, the Earle becauſe none of the whole rout ſhould eſcape, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fire to be ſet on all the houſing about it. There were two Captaines ouer theſe forces, whereof the one figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting valiantly at the gate of the place was there ſlaine, the other which had gotten himſelfe vp into a tower, was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

caught hold of euery thing about him, to leape down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long amongſt the thickeſt of his enemies, where being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued vpon their pikes and ſwordes points, he was hoyſed vp againe into the fyre and ſo ended his life. All the reſt periſhed miſerably in the fire, three hundreth onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted which tooke their flight directly homeward towards <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and ſo eſcaped. This <hi>Peter de Boys</hi> whom we ſpake of, being not farre of, ſaw in what diſtreſſe his fellowes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned, and beheld the ſad ſpectacle of their deſtruction, but by reaſon of a riuer and certaine mariſhes betweene, he was not able to come time enough to their reſcue. For which cauſe aſſoone as he came home with his company to <hi>Gaunt,</hi> he had like to haue beene ſlaine by the common people. But he alledged ſuch reaſonable excuſe, that he gaue them contentment, and withall perſwaded them, that in regard they had loſt two expert men of warre in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, they ſhould authoriſe ſome one other by whoſe indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry they thought the affaires of the common wealth might be better directed: for ſo it was needfull hauing to deale with ſuch a cruell enemy.</p>
                  <p>The Earle diſmiſſing a good part of his army, ſent the reſt into garriſons, but eſpecially to the defence of <hi>Arde.</hi> In the meane time about twelue hundred of the faction of the white cappes, hauing aduertiſement what time cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine gentlemen would raunge abroad out of <hi>Arde</hi> to fetch in ſome booty, brake out of an ambuſh vppon them as they returned with their prey, and put moſt of them to the ſword.

Now the ſame time there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain maſſe prieſt called Sir <hi>Iohn Wallis,</hi> who had preached in his ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the people, that equalitie ought to be obſerued in all things, that one man was no better then another, the gentleman then the churle, the rich then the poore, the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then the ignorant: but all men were deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſelfe ſame parents, euen <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eve,</hi> and that our firſt fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers liued all after one ſort, without any ine quality of ſtate, or difference of perſons. Herewithall he perſwaded them to aſſemble in great number, and make ſuite to the King for redreſſe, who becauſe he was young, might perhaps be brought to harken to their requeſts, or if he would not, then to ſet themſelues at libertie by the ſword. This prieſt being apprenhended and committed to priſon for theſe matters, was by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> let looſe, vpon what conſcience I know not, but ſutelie it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to his owne ſorrow and confuſion.

The poorer ſort of the Londoners for enuie they bare to the rich (as it is commonly ſeene) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this courſe of the rebelles, and by letters ſoll icited them to come to London, promiſing to giue them entrance into the Citie.

At <hi>Rocheſter</hi> they tooke a certaine knight by force, and <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iohn Newton</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Caſtle of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</hi> At Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heath.</note> made him to become their leader: and for aſſurance that he ſhould not deceiue them, made him deliuer his children into their hands for pledges. When they came within a little of London, they ſent him to the King with this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:5967:52"/>
that they were minded to haue ſome ſpeech with him concerning weightie affaires, and therefore that he ſhould come forth and talke with them. The King vppon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, made aunſwere that he would performe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. So the next day accompanied with certaine lords he entred his barge, and rowing neere the place where they were deſcended to the ſhore in great number expecting his comming, he demaunded of them what they would with him? They required that he would come out of his barge to parlie, and then their demands ſhould be declared vnto him. But the King diſtruſting their multitude, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further communication returned backe againe. Then being more vehemently mooued, they haſtned to London, making ſpoile of ſome lawyers and gentlemens houſes in their way. And when they approched the Citie, finding the gates ſhut againſt them, they threatned to ſet fire on the ſuburbs, with the cruelleſt effects of their furie beſides, and that if they entred by force, it ſhould be to the vtter deſtruction of all that were in it. The Citizens here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with diſmaid, eſpecially conſidering that a great number within inclined to ſedition and tumult, gaue them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. They were no ſooner come in but preſentlie they raunged through all the tauernes and tipling houſes and fell to drinking and making good cheere, no man preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſo much as once to ſay them nay of any thing.

In the euening they aſſembled themſelues altogether againe in a company before the tower (where the King then remained, and with <note place="margin">At Saint <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therines.</hi>

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to whome this attempt ſeemed daungerous and of great vncertainty in the euent, iudged it better that means were made to pacifie them with ſome gentle and plauſible oration. And this counſell tooke effect. The day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King ſent them word, that as many as would ſpeake with him ſhould repaire to a certaine place where he would <note place="margin">Mile end.</note> meete them, and giue ſatisfaction to their demaunds. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny came, and many taried ſtill in the citie, eſpecially the cheefe captaines of the ſedition: who aſſoone as the King was gone forth, followed with ſome fower hundreth of <note place="margin">VVat Tiler, Iack Straw, <hi>&amp;</hi> Iohn Ball.</note> their companions brake into the tower, and there ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> they cut of his head, and ſerued diuers others alſo <note place="margin">Simon Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> of great account in the ſame ſort, whoſe heads they prict vpon polles, and ſet them vp vppon the bridge, and other places of greateſt view and moſt reſort in the citie. When the King came to communication with the rebells, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded gently of them, what they required? Marry (quoth they) that thou ſet vs and our Children and our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie that ſhall come after vs at libertie for euer, and being ſo enlarged, maintaine and preſerue vs from all manner of bondage and ſeruitude, either in ſhew, or ſubſtance. The King promiſed to fulfill their requeſts, and therevppon ſigned &amp; deliuered vnto them certain writings and charters for the ſame, wherewith a great part of them were reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well ſatisfied, and began to be much more tractable. But the principall heads of rebellion which, as I told you, abode ſtill behinde, being villaines of moſt wicked diſpoſition, whoſe only deſire was to make a prey of rich mens goods, had drawn together in the meane time ſome twentie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand with part of the comminalty intending to haue falne to rifling preſently. But the King comming vnawares (though not out of ſeaſon) vpon them, as he returned from parly with the rebells at the place appointed without the

As he continued in his arrogant ſpeeches and behauiour to the King, the Mayor of the Citie diſdaining thereat, thruſt him through with his ſword. Then might ye haue ſeene the enraged <note place="margin">VVilliam VValworth.</note> multitude in a blind furie euen ready to haue deſtroyed them all: but the King pacified them preſſing himſelfe alone into the thickeſt of them, which otherwiſe perhaps might haue ſeemed a poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Many counſelled the King to haue purſued them in their departure, and to haue ſet vppon them as they were ſeparated and diſperſed. But the king would not allow of that courſe, nor ſuffer any violence as then to be vſed towards them: thinking that with more eaſe and better leiſure he might take puniſhment of them at his pleaſure hereafter. Neither were all offenders alike: for, as in ſuch commotions it happeneth, a great ſort were taken vp by the way perforce, and compelled to go along with the reſt for company. And he vſed this gentleneſſe the rather becauſe the chiefe captaines and ringleaders of this miſchiefe, beeing detected by the people, they onely might be put to death, and the reſidue be pardoned.</p>

It happened the author of this ſo miſerable and vnmercifull ſpectacle, in a certaine skirmiſh (ſuch as there were many) falling into an ambuſh of the <hi>Gauntoys,</hi> to be ſlaine.

Amongſt other articles this was one, that within fifteen daies after, the <hi>Gauntoys</hi> ſhould deliuer two hundreth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſuch as the Earle ſhould nominate, to be diſpoſed of at his pleaſure. <hi>Peter de Bloys</hi> and <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Arteuill</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſecret intelligence hereof, and ſuſpecting themſelues might be ſome of the number, prouided a competent crew of their faction to be in a readineſſe at all aſſayes, and the next morning when the articles of peace were read pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely in the Towne-houſe, they entred in ſtrongly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied, and ſlue twoo Aldermen of great account: the ſame which were chiefe agents for the towne in this treaty of agreement. With this fact the Earle was ſo exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouoked that it ſeemd from thence forth he would neuer haue come to any compoſition with the <hi>Gauntoyes</hi> before he had vtterly rooted out the whole rabble of that ſeditious generation.</p>

Another vprore happened alſo at <hi>Roan</hi> not vnlike to this at <hi>Paris,</hi> but it was ſuppreſſed by the King himſelfe.

                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Cambridge</hi> of whome we ſpake before, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a long paſſage for want of good weather, after he had been much toſſed vppon the ſeas with the contrary winds, at laſt arriued with all his ſouldiers at <hi>Lisbone</hi> in <hi>Portugall:</hi> When he had taried there certaine moneths, the King of <hi>Portingale</hi> beſtowed all his men in garriſons, giuing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement that they ſhould not attempt any thing againſt the enemy without his knowledge and direction.

                  <p>It was covenanted between the King and the Pariſians, that the mony which they were to pay weekly ſhold be kept by the treaſurer of the Citie, and no part of it to be expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded about any other occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but only in time of neceſſity for the maintenance of men of warre. Now the french King when he ſhould ſend his ſuccours unto <hi>Spaine,</hi> required the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer to diſburſe an hundreth thouſand franks for the vſe of that ſeruice. The treaſurer neither refuſing, nor perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, delayed the matter with friuolous excuſes.

                     </note> things needfull, and hauing gathered together about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thouſand men, he proceeded on his voyage. When he arriued at <hi>Auinion</hi> where Pope <hi>Clement</hi> then remained, he found the hearts of the noblity meruailouſly inclined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.

were altogether addicted to his aduerſarie, <hi>Charles</hi> the King of <hi>Hungaries</hi> nephewe heretofore mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. This <hi>Charles</hi> after the death of the Queene of <hi>Naples,</hi> who left no iſſue of her owne to enioye her inheritance, vſurped the title and dominion of all theſe ſeigniories: affirming that the Popes gifte to the Duke of <hi>Aniow</hi> was for twoo eſpeciall cauſes of no force nor value. Firſt, becauſe it was not in the deceaſed Queenes power to alienate thoſe things that were not her owne: which opinion of his the Neapolitanes and Sicilians ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mayntained. And againe, though it had beene moſt free for her to diſpoſe of them all at her pleaſure, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in thoſe countries they acknowledged <hi>Vrbane</hi> for chiefe biſhop, and not <hi>Clement</hi> to whome and from whome that conveyance was made, the gift muſt neceſſarily be voyd and fruſtrate. <hi>Charles</hi> had long before furniſhed <note place="margin">Zeuf <hi>an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: ſee</hi> Froſ: Chro: Lib: 2.

Into this caſtle abundantly ſtored with all neceſſaries for certain yeares, he withdrew himſelfe and his retinue: taking no great thought for the reſt, in regard he was wel aſſured that the Neapolitanes would neuer forſake him, and as for <hi>Calabria</hi> though he loſt it for the preſent, yet after a yeere or two he made no queſtion to recouer it. For he knew the Duke muſt alwaies maintaine a great army in pay for feare of rebellion, which he could not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, but either want of money or victuall would force him to great inconuenience. So that his power being weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and his numbers diſperſed, he might eaſily be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne and driuen out of the country. But there was a certaine coniurer which promiſed the Duke of <hi>Aniow</hi> to blinde the eies of them in the Caſtle, in ſuch ſorte as they <note place="margin">This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunter by ſuch like illuſions had before cauſed the Queene of <hi>Naples</hi> and her husband to yeild vp the ſame ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle into the hands of <hi>Charles.

Whereupon ſome counſelled to forrey the country &amp; take out their wages in pillage; but others of more ſtayed iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſounder diſcretion perſwaded the contrary, and ſo at length by intreaty they obtayned that which they were purpoſed to haue gotten by violence. After this the King of <hi>Portingale</hi> leuyed an army of fifteene thouſand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Engliſh: and the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hauing a power of thirty thouſand, bad him battell. Both their forces came into the field, and many dayes together light skirmiſhes paſſed betweene them. But the king of <hi>Portingale</hi> becauſe his enemies forces were more in number then his, would in no wiſe ioyne with him in a ſette battell. The Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> (whom this matter chiefly concerned, in regard he marryed the eldeſt daughter of <hi>Don Pietro)</hi> had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his brother at his ſetting forth towards <hi>Spaine,</hi> that as ſoone as he had diſpatcht his affaires in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he would come thither alſo himſelfe, and bring an other army.

But by reaſon of the late inſurrection, the ſtate being ſomewhat trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in <hi>England,</hi> the King thought it not conuenient to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:5967:56"/>
ſend his men of warre out of the Countrey. The King of <hi>Portingale</hi> therefore ſeeing no more ſuccours come, began to treate with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> of peace, though altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the mindes of the Engliſh: whoſe Generall highly offended with the matter, returned thereupon into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and tooke with him his ſonne alſo, to whome the king of <hi>Portingales</hi> daughter named <hi>Beatrice</hi> a Lady of 10 years old had beene lately betrothed.

and earneſtly entreating him, that he would not neglect this good opportunity, now whilſt his aduerſaries were ſo tractable to deale with, and ſo deſirous of agreement. Whereunto the Earle made anſwere, that he had not leyſure to be preſent there himſelfe, but to gratify thoſe honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſons that had trauelled ſo farre in the matter, he would ſend ſome in few daies after, which ſhould fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with his reſolution: the effect whereof, vpon relation of his meſſengers, was much to this purpoſe.

And amongſt the reſt, a certaine caſtle of the Earles where they found the holy Funt wherein the Earle was chriſtened, with his cradle and ſuch other things, which were all made a prey to the barbarous fury and outrage of the ſoldier. The Earle being thus vtterly ouerthrowne &amp; brought vnder foote, conſidered how there was no other hope of recouery now remayning but one, which was to moue the French king to commiſeration of his eſtate. To this therefore he addreſſed himſelfe: and for better obtayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his purpoſe, employed the friendly endeauour of <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>

French king, beſeeching him that he would be a meanes to make reconciliation betweene the Earle &amp; his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. He wrote not this ſo much for any good faith which he intended, as to learne hereby what opinion was holden of him in <hi>Fraunce.</hi> But aſſoone as hee ſaw himſelfe diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed there (for the King had diſdaine at his letters) he turned to the King of <hi>England,</hi> of whome he not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted ayd for the <hi>Gauntoyes,</hi> but alſo (altogether out of ſeaſon) demaunded the two hundreth thouſand crownes that his father <hi>Iaques</hi> had lent King <hi>Edward</hi> at the ſiege of <hi>Tourney:</hi> by meanes whereof it came to paſſe that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned neither the one nor the other. For had he made no mention at all of the money, but onely entreated of the league, it is like enough he might haue obtayned his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Flaunders</hi> hauing acceſſe now opened vnto him by reaſon the kings mind was ſo addicted to this war, tooke his iourney into <hi>Fraunce.</hi> And after he had receiued his inauguration at the kings hands, for the county of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toys</hi> (which was lately befalne him) he began to conceiue better hope of his affaires: eſpecially when he ſawe ſo puiſſant a Prince, with ſuch forwardnes of affection, bring a mighty army of no leſſe then threeſcore thouſand men, to wage batell againſt his enemy in the maintenance of his quarell. Whereof ſo ſoone as <hi>Phillip</hi> had receiued ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſement, he omitted no part of what pertained to his charge, but commaunded preſently that all the bridges vpon the riuer <hi>Liſe</hi> which were nere hand, ſhould be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken downe.

                     <hi>Skeld</hi> not farre from <hi>Tourney,</hi> to the intent the army might paſſe eaſily from thence into <hi>Arde.</hi> At length it likte them beſt to venture vppon the enemy before mentioned which lay at <hi>Comius.</hi> When they came thither, they found the bridge broken downe and no paſſage to get ouer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uppon they fell againe to conſultation. In the meane while certaine aduenturous gallants which were deſirous to make ſome proofe of their valour (hauing formerly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed amongſt themſelues, that if no paſſage could be found, they would ſecretly vſe ſome meanes by their owne induſtry without knowledge of their commanders, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey themſelues ouer) with the helpe of three or foure ſmall botes ſlyding along by a cord faſtened to both ſides of the riuer, paſſed ouer in that ſorte by a fewe at once, till they had gotten all their company to the further ſide in ſafety: and this they did with ſo little trouble or daunger, that the enemy who lay encamped not farre of, neuer perceiued it before ſuch time as he ſaw them marching towards him with Enſignes diſplayd. <hi>Peter de Boyis</hi> immagining that ſo ſmall a number durſt neuer venture vppon him, becauſe the cuening approched, would not fight with them as then, but rather thought to ſet vppon them in the night when the wearineſſe of their trauell had ouertaken them with <note place="margin">They were in all not aboue ſoure or fiue hundreth. <hi>Froſ.

All their neighbours immitating their example, did both pay great ſummes of money, and alſo brought their captaines priſoners which perſwaded them to ſtand out in rebellion. But the Earle of <hi>Flaunders</hi> was called to councell in none of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.

                  <p>When <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Arteuill</hi> vnderſtood that the power of the moſt puiſſant King was encamped not farre from him, he alſo brought forth his army into the field, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of ſome fifty thouſand men.

Which thing in their behalfe all good and well gouerned common wealthes deſired, to whome no tydings could be more acceptable, then to heare that the <hi>Gauntoys</hi> fighting valiantly and conſtantly in defence of their liberty, had reaped the honourable reward of their vertue and courage, by deſtroying ſuch perſons as through ambition and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe could not ſuffer any common wealth to remain in quiet. When he had ſpoken much more to this effect, he commanded that in the conflict they ſhould put all to the ſword, and ſpare no man, the King only excepted. The <hi>Flemings</hi> not forgetting what <hi>Phillip</hi> had told them, fought very manfully: &amp; this alſo not a little ſharpened their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that they had ſtirred vp ſuch a puiſſant enemy againſt them, whome if they might ouercome, it would redound to their perpetual fame amongſt all poſterity.

For had it falne out otherwiſe then it did, ſurely (as the world then went) it would haue giuen a great blow to their anthority, and haue ſhaken euen the ſeates of Kings and Princes.

But <hi>Peter de Boys</hi> being brought thither in a horſelitter (for he was yet weake of his wounds) with his great words and glorious vaunts, quite put that imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination out of their heads. After the french King vppon

                  <p>The <hi>Gauntoys</hi> as is ſhewed before, had ſent to the King of <hi>England</hi> about the obtaynment of a league; the articles whereof (deuiſed by his counſell) the King ſent to them in writing by a gentleman of his houſhold, that if the Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings allowed them, they ſhould confirme them with their ſeales. But the ambaſſadour arriuing at <hi>Calice,</hi> when he heard how the <hi>Gauntoys</hi> were ouerthrowne, and that the french men had ſubdued moſt part of the country, without performance of his commiſſion he returned into <hi>England.</hi> Neither were the Engliſh nobility greatly ſory that the <hi>Gauntoys</hi> went by the worſe: whome if it had fortuned to go away with victory, the commons generally in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres adioyning, would from thence haue deriued a patterne of pride and rebellion, and conſidering how but lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there had been moſt perillous tumults in <hi>England,</hi> eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall matter might haue miniſtred new occaſion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. Thus they thought, and this was their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whilſt the french king lay at <hi>Tourney,</hi> diuers well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſons laboured very earneſtly to make a reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the Earle and his rebellious ſubiects. The <hi>Gauntoys</hi> refuſed not to be at the french Kings diſpoſition, but rather then receiue the Earle <hi>Lewis</hi> againe, it ſeemed they would endure all extremityes whatſoeuer.

And to compaſſe this matter the better, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned the chiefe of the Clergy (whome he had exempted from this payment) to vrge forwarde the inferiour ſort to make contribution. By this meanes, neither the kings trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is exhauſted, nor the common people burthened more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they gaue of their own voluntary affection: which ſurely euery man did for his part moſt liberally, as the world went in thoſe dayes: eſpecially in conſideration of the reward propoſed (which was not meane nor ordinarie) the opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of obtaining whereof, no man thought was in any wiſe to be neglected.

Then the Biſhop in a froward faſhion told them, that for his part he would make them no ſafe conduct neither to goe nor tarry; if they would needs paſſe, they might do it at their owne perill.

For there was no league e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed between them, and it grieued the Engliſh not a little that the french men wonne the victory in the former battell, ſo enuious were they of the french mens honour or good fortune.

                     <hi>Gauntoys</hi> who were partakers of the Engliſh mens counſels, for hatred they bare to their Lord, interrupted this treaty.

The Biſhop as vnskilfull in matters of warre ſo wonderouſly proud, when he heard that the kings power was comming againſt him, ſtreytway diſlodged his campe, and breaking vp his ſiege withdrew himſelfe towards the ſea coaſt, with part of his army (the reſt being diſperſed in garriſons) to the intent that when his enemy approched, he might the better prouide for his ſafety by an eaſy retreyte to <hi>Calice.</hi> In the Kings army was the Duke of <hi>Britaine,</hi> which ſeemed a ſtraunge ſight to the Engliſhmen, through whoſe friendſhip and aſſiſtance he had often been ſuccoured &amp; reſtored to his Duke dome. But he might lawfully do it at that time without empeachment of his honour. Firſt, becauſe he was lately before reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the french King: and againe in regard he ought this reciprocall dutie to the Earle of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> whoſe boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and good affection he had abundantly taſted in the time of his neceſſity, when he liued as an exile, expnlſed out of his owne country. Such is the inſtability of mans eſtate, that the affliction which oppreſſeth one to day, ſeizeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon another to morrow. And yet the Duke ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe no whit vnmindfull of the benefits he had receiued from the Engliſh, who vpon the approche of the french ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, had retyred themſelues into a certaine towne called <hi>Borborough,</hi> and were beſieged in the ſame. For conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the imminent perill that hung ouer their heads, which they could no way auoyd but by yeelding (the ſucceſſe whereof was likewiſe vncertaine) he ceaſed not to exhort them (as they parlyed with him from the walles) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide in time for their owne ſafegard by offering ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable compoſition. The Engliſhmen not only vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:5967:62"/>
accepted his motion, but further entreated him to be a meanes to the King for the effecting of their purpoſe, which he alſo vndertooke and performed. So the King vppon ſome deliberation, receiuing the towne into his hands, ſuffered all the Engliſhmen to depart without harme or violence. When the expedition was ended, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my brake vp, the King gaue honourable thanks to ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Captaines as had ſerued him in this iourney, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to Duke <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>Bauier,</hi> who had put himſelfe forth into this action, only vpon deſire to ſee the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and to obſerue the order and diſcipline of the french warres.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> deſirous in regard of his good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, aſwell to the french King as the Engliſh, to bring them to agreement, procured ſo much by his great trauell and diligence, that an appointment was made for the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of certaine ambaſſadours from <hi>Fraunce, England,</hi> and <hi>Spaine.</hi> For the french King would not deale with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, but ſo as the Spaniard might be included in the treaty. And becauſe in ſo doubtfull a caſe, neither the french men wold come to <hi>Calice,</hi> nor the Engliſhmen to <hi>Boloine,</hi> a place indifferent betweene both was aſſigned for their meeting.

But howſoeuer the caſe ſtoode, they prepared to defend themſelues. When report hereof was brought to the french King, the Peeres began to accuſe one another of negligence in forgetting a matter of ſo great moment.

                  <p>Concerning the Earles of <hi>Henault,</hi> ye muſt conceiue that <hi>William</hi> the Lord of this ſeigniory had foure daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Margaret, Phillip, Ione,</hi> and <hi>Iſabell,</hi> and one ſonne named <hi>VVilliam.

The Earle of <hi>Foys</hi> an honourable and valiant gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, held in cuſtodie a certaine noble man whom he had <note place="margin">The ſtrange ſtory of <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cone</hi> Earle of <hi>Foys,</hi> and his ſonne.</note> taken priſoner, by the lawe of armes, who for his ranſome couenanted to pay fifty thouſand franks, for which ſumme the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> (whoſe ſiſter the Earle had married) profered to become ſurety. But the Earle ſuſpecting the Kings credite (wherewith perhaps he had beene too well acquainted) would not but vpon better aſſurance, deliuer his priſoner. His wife diſpleaſed to ſee her brother no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſpected, was very importunate with her husband, and would not be in quiet till ſhe had perſwaded him: of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes making mention how there was a matter of as great value as that, to be aſſigned to her brother in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her dowry, and therefore that he neede not feare to be deceiued. The priſoner by this meanes being ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as ſoone as he came home into his countrey, to the intent to diſcharge his credite, prouided the ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſent it at his day accordingly, not to the Earle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but to the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> his ſurety: which when the Earle vnderſtoode, hee maruelled much the mony was not brought him, and by his wife (who willingly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke the iourney) ſignified his minde to the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> deſiring him to remember his promiſe, who vpon receit of the meſſage anſwered his ſiſter in this ſort: Siſter, this mony belongs all to you as your husbands debt in lieu of your dowry, and ſince it is now come to my handes, I will in no wiſe ſuffer it to paſſe from me againe. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne ſhe to intreate and earneſtly to beſeech him that hee would alter his purpoſe in that behalfe, ſhewing how great occaſion it would miniſter of perpetuall hatred and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene them, &amp; how ſhe durſt neuer returne home to her husband, vnleſſe ſhe brought the mony with her: for hee was by nature wrathfull, and would neuer be pleaſed with her againe, if he ſawe himſelfe deceitfully dealt with, conſidering how ſhe was the onely meanes which mooued him to accept that aſſurance, and to deliuer his priſoner,

neither of which he would haue done but vpon hir intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and therefore the whole blame would be imputed to her by her husband. When ſhe had oftentimes thus expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulated in vaine, and ſawe his obſtinate minde would be nothing changed, not daring to goe backe into her owne country, ſhe abode ſtill in <hi>Nauarre</hi> with her brother.

So he tooke his leaue, and went from thence to <hi>Pampelone</hi> to doe the like to his vncle: who not onely vſed him with all honourable and kinde reſpect, but alſo at his departure gaue him many rich giftes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, a purſe with a little box in it full of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine confection in fine powlder, the force whereof was ſuch, that whoſoeuer had taſted of it in neuer ſo ſmal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, ſhould incontinently haue died. In preſenting this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable gift to his yong kinſeman, he vtterd theſe ſpeeches. You ſee (ſweet nephew) how great diſpleaſure your father hath conceiued againſt your mother, yet not ſo great but that there is poſſibility they may be againe reconciled. No man will imagine how much I am grieued for the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment betweene them, and no leſſe in duty ought you to be alſo. But for remedy of this inconuenience, when you are returned to your father, you ſhall find the meanes to caſt alittle of this powlder vpon the meate which ſhal be ſet before him, but you muſt do it very cloſely: for it will come to paſſe, that whereas now he vtterly abhorreth her, as ſoone as he hath eaten of that meate, he ſhall deſire her aboue all things; inſomuch as he ſhall ſcarcely at any time endure her out of his company, ſo great ſhall be his loue, ſo ardent his affection. Vndoubtedly you haue much reaſon to wiſh it were ſo; but in any wiſe beware you make no man of your counſell, for then you looſe your labour. The

yong gentleman as yet vnacquainted with the world, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his vncle (of whom he would neuer haue ſuſpected ill) had intended good faith and ſpoken as he thought, receiued the gift tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfully, &amp; promiſed to do according to his direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When he came home, his father gently welco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med him, inquiring of diuers circumſtances concerning his iourney, and other nouelties, and amongſt the reſt, whether his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle had giuen him any at his parting, or no. He anſwered yes, and ſhewed him all his gifts, the box only excepted. But it ſo fell out, that a baſtard ſon of the Earles, who kept familiar company with his brother, I know not by what occaſion, lighted vppon his garment and found the purſe hanging at it, wherein he perceiued ſome ſpeciall thing whatſoeuer it were, was contained. Wherevppon queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning with his brother what it ſhould be that he carryed ſo continually about him in his boſome, he would giue him no anſwere, but changed colour and ſeemed angry that he had been ſo inquiſitiue. Within few dayes after they fell at variance playing at tennice, and the young Lord buffetted his baſtard brother with his fiſts: who hauing no other meanes to make his party good, ranne ſtraight to the Earle with a lamentable complaint, ſhewing what iniury was donne to him by his brother, who indeed deſerued to be beaten himſelfe, and well chaſtized with a whip. And for what cauſe (quoth the Earle) doeſt thou thinke him worthy to be whipt? becauſe (quoth the baſtard) euer ſince he ruturned from his mother, he hath carryed about him at his breaſt a thing with a ranke ſauour, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I know not, but that he told me it would not be long before his mother and you were reconciled. With that the Earle began to haue ſome ſuſpition, and commaunded the boy to keepe all ſecret.

Then the Earle enraged with anger, and trembling all ouer his body, roſe vp againſt his ſonne intending doubtleſſe to haue ſlaine him, but that the Gentlemen which were about him, abhorring the cruelty of ſuch a fact, and amazed at the ſtrangenes of the accident, withheld him. When he ſaw he could be ſuffered to vſe no other violence, with bitter execrations he curſed his ſonne, that had gone about ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally, and with ſo horrible kind of death to haue mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered his owne father, who had oftentimes ſuſtained great warres againſt mighty and puiſſant Princes, only to enlarge his ſeigniorie and to leaue him the richer inheritance. All that were preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t did what they could to appeaſe his wrath: but he commaunded his ſonne forth with to priſon, and to be ſure he ſhould not eſcape, gaue in charge that he ſhould be ſtreyghtly watched, threatning this keeper with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame puniſhment if he ſhewed him any fauour.

But the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens perſwaſion tooke place: who aſſoone as the ſigne of battell was giuen, ran furiouſly vppon their enemyes, and aſſayled them with great violence. The fight was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with great force and courage on both ſides: but the valour and skill of the Engliſh archers here approoued it <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Portugale</hi> through the Engliſh mens ayde obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble victorie.</note> ſelfe, as it had oftentimes done in other places. For the ſhowers of arrowes which they ſent amongſt the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo galled their horſes, and diſtreſſed their men, that the greateſt part of them being ſlaine the reſidue were all taken priſoners. The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> with the reſt of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the nomber of twenty thouſand, was two miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind when the French men gaue this ouer-haſty onſet: and when word was brought him, that they were dangerouſly engaged, and in perill to be all ſlaine, he was very deſirous to haue come to their reſcue, but he could not bring his ſouldiers forward. For it was determined amongſt them, that ſeeing the french men would needes ſeeme valiant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the reſt, and had vaunted themſelues with ſo great brauery, they would giue them leaue to goe through with
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:5967:70"/>
their enterpriſe alone, and diſclaime all intereſt in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of their proceedings. A little before night the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> drewe neere to his enemy, who vppon aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement thereof, firſt placed his men againe in order of battell, and then gaue commaundement on paine of death, that all ſuch as had any priſoners ſhould preſently kill the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, leaſt in the enſuing conflict, they might happen to recouer armes and ioyne with the enemy. Surely it was a cruell ſight, and ſuch a one as mooued even the conquerours themſelues to pitty and teares: but there was no remedy, they muſt doe as they were commaunded. There was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a thouſand of theſe priſoners, all which were conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a cowardly kind of death; ſo as it appeared, their fellowes which dyed valiantly before in fight were much more happy then they, who being both by fortune and their owne vertue preſerued, after aſſurance giuen by the enemy, and receiued by them according to the law of atmes, fell into extreame calamity at ſuch time as they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues moſt ſecure of life and ſafety, and were ſlaine by the conquerour, not enraged and angry as in the fury of battell, but being now at peace with them and euen himſelfe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring ſuch an vnnaturall ſlaughter. The Portingales through the great aduantage of their ground, ouerthrew their enemies againe; and in this ſecond battell was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhewed to no man. They that could, ſaued themſelues by flight, the reſt were all ſlaine. The Spaniards miſt of their number about ſeauen thouſand. Afterwards (as the cuſtome of Princes is when they haue performed many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table miſchiefes) a truce was agreed vppon. So the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> diſmiſſed his ſouldiers, and the King of <hi>Portugale</hi> was receiued with great triumph into <hi>Lisbone.</hi>

                  <p>About the ſame time the French men recouered all that was holden by certaine Brigants in the country of <hi>Tholous</hi> &amp; the places there adioining. The <hi>Gaſcones</hi> for that the wars they made in <hi>France</hi> was greatly to their enriching, did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſerue vnder the King of <hi>England:</hi> and if they had been

gently and reſpectiuely vſed they would neuer haue chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Lord. But the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Sonne by his ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge behauiour alienated the greateſt part of the nobility from him, in ſuch ſort that they forſooke him, &amp; put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder protection of the French King.

Herevpon grew hatred betweene them, and by this occaſion <hi>Charles</hi> the fift recouered all againe, as hath been already declared.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the warres were yet hotly purſued between the two Popes, the ſouldiers of <hi>Clement</hi> had beſieged <hi>Vrbane</hi> in <note place="margin">Pope <hi>Vrbane</hi> beſieged.</note> a certaine caſtle of <hi>Italy,</hi> and if money had come to content them he had ſurely beene taken.

This diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene the two Popes, drew almoſt all the Princes of Chriſtendom into ſundry factions, as hath beene ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. Theſe miſeries and many other wherewith the Clergie ſhould ſometimes be afflicted, a certaine <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcane</hi> Fryer had long ſince foretolde in the time of <hi>Pope Innocent:</hi> and being for the ſame caſt in priſon at <hi>Auinion,</hi> had loſt his head for his labour, but that he confirmed his ſayings by authoritie of ſcripture.</p>
                  <p>We haue ſpoken of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> king of <hi>Portingall,</hi> which left behinde him one onely daughter named <hi>Beatrice,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Now my author declareth how he vnderſtood afterward, that ſhe was begotten by the king of <hi>Portugall</hi> vppon a certaine Ladie whome he had rauiſhed, and whoſe huſband he had chaſed out of the kingdome: and that his daughter ſo borne was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by Pope <hi>

doubts, dealt in ſuch ſort with his nobilitie and chiefeſt of the citties, that they all ſolemnly promiſed him, not to acknowledge any other ſoueraigne after his death, then this his onely daughter, neither to admitte any man elſe to the ſucceſſion of the crowne, but him that ſhould haue her in marriage. Aſſoone as he was departed out of this life, the noble men were deſirous the inheritance ſhould paſſe to the King of <hi>Spaine:</hi> but the citties for hatred they bare to the Spanyards, aduanced him to the crowne, of whom we haue oftentimes ſpoken before, namely the baſe brother of the King deceaſſed. And becauſe at ſuch time as the king of <hi>Portugall</hi> dyed, the Ladies huſband remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtill aliue, moſt men thought that the childe begotten betweene them, was borne in adultery. Moreouer that couple had liued fiue yeeres together as man and wife, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king doting in his wicked and frantick affection, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted this diſhonourable practiſe, not only for a Prince, but for any other perſon, moſt vnworthy and ſhamefull. The wretched husband being robbed of his wife, gat him to the King of <hi>Spaine:</hi> and after the King of <hi>Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales</hi> deceaſe returned againe to <hi>Liſhone,</hi> but receiued his wife no more, following therein the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Afterward he was ſlaine in a certaine ſkirmiſh: and it is likely he had ſmall ioy of his life, conſidering the extreame iniury and diſgrace receiued from ſuch a one, of whom he had no hope to be reuenged.</p>
                  <p>At ſuch time as <hi>Lisbone</hi> was beſieged by the Spanyards, the king of <hi>Portingale</hi> ſent Embaſſadors into <hi>England,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting and requeſting the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to ſuccour him in this great neceſſitie, againſt ſuch an enemy as both poſſeſſed a kingdome which was none of his owne, and ſought alſo by force to ſeize vpon the crowne of <hi>Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale,</hi> whereto he had no more right then to the other. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hearing of their ambaſſage, it was concluded that the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ſhould be ſent into <hi>Portingale,</hi> and all
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:5967:71"/>
things were prepared and made ready for his voyage, when ſuddainly the Admirall of <hi>Fraunce</hi> landing with an army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> from thence made warre vppon the <note place="margin">Page. 127.</note> Engliſh, as hath bene before declared. Hereuppon the Dukes iourney was ſtayed. Neuertheleſſe the King of <hi>Portingale</hi> fought proſperouſly, and vanquiſhed his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in two battells as is ſhewed already. And after this victorie returning to <hi>Liſbone,</hi> by aduiſe of his counſell, he ſent Ambaſſadours againe to the king of <hi>England,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> deſiring him if euer he meant to attempt any thing againſt his aduerſarie the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that he would not neglect the preſent opportunitie. For twiſe he himſelfe had already defeated him in battell, and driuen him from the field: now did he quake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for diſtruſt of his eſtate, and it were an eaſie matter to ouerthrowe him whollie, ſpecially if they ſhould aſſaile him with both their forces vnited together. Scarce could he know on which ſide to turne him, his affaires and his counſels would be all ſo confounded: and that his ſtate might be more violently ſhaken, it ſeemed beſt in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to make preſent inuaſion vppon him befote he ſhould recouer his ſtrength or bethinke him of the danger. When theſe and many other like matters had beene deliuered by the Ambaſſadors, it pleaſed the King that the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ſhould now at length proceede with his voyage before vndertaken. So with a certaine number of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall.

                     </note> and more then two thouſand archers, accompanied with his wife and children, he tooke ſhipping at a certain hauen in <hi>Wales,</hi> whither the <hi>Portingales</hi> vppon aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from their ambaſſadors, had before ſent fiue and twentie ſhippes and Gallies to attend him. And becauſe he ſaw great likelyhood of troubles to ariſe in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; that he was enuyed by many which were in authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the King his nephew, he was very glad and deſirous to goe this iourney. His firſt landing was in the hauen of <hi>Breſt,</hi> which towne becauſe the Engliſhmen refuſed to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:5967:72"/>
reſtore to the Duke of <hi>Britaine,</hi> was at that time by the Britons and Frenchmen together beſeiged. But the Duke of <hi>Lancaſters</hi> puiſſance enforced the Britons to raiſe their ſeige. Then directed he his courſe towards <hi>Cologne</hi> a towne in <hi>Spaine.</hi> For after much deliberation it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally thought more honour to land firſt in their enemies country, then to go ſtreight to their friends. But the towne was ſo ſtrongly fortifyed as their atttempt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour was vaine. Therefore looſing from thence they <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> arri-Seth in <hi>paine.</hi>
                     </note> ſayled to <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> into which towne after ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were honourably receiued.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoone as the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> heard tydings of the Engliſhmens arriuall, he tooke counſell with certaine French Lords whome he chiefly fauoured, concerning his affaires, and what they thought of the Engliſhmens proceedings. They were abſolutely of opinion, that the king of <hi>Portugale</hi> ſhould marry the Duke of <hi>Lancaſters</hi> daughter, and therefore that it behou'd him to require ayde of the French king: who both in reſpect of his owne good diſpoſition, and the moſt ſtrict and auncient alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance betweene <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Fraunce,</hi> would not faile of his friendly dutie in that behalfe. Moreouer aſſuring him that there were a great number in <hi>Fraunce</hi> ſo ill affected to idlenes that nothing could happen more according to their deſires, then to meete with any occaſion of milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary employment. When they had giuen him this counſell, they further aduiſed him to take order, that all weake holds, churches, and ſuch like, whereinto the country people had conueyed their goods for feare of the forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſouldiers ſhould be beaten downe. For thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were ſuch as could not be defended, and if they were taken, the prey and pillage therein would afforde greate profite and aduantage to the enemy. The King to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this counſell ſeemed not amiſſe, authoriſed the French men to caſt downe what they thought good at their diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and withall to ſeize whatſoeuer they found in them
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:5967:72"/>
(after a day prefixed) to their owne commodity. The French king being ſolicited by the king of <hi>Spayne</hi> for ayd, required him to be of good courage, for within ſhort ſpace he would bend all the forces he was able to make againſt the Engliſh nation: who being once ſubdued, he would ſend ſtore of ſouldiers into <hi>Spaine,</hi> by whoſe helpe he ſhould be enabled, not onely to brydle and reſtrayne, but to breake and confound the puiſſance of both his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries. Whilſt the Engliſhmen wintred at <hi>Compoſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> they made often rodes into the country, and brought certaine townes vnder their ſubiection. In the meane time the king of <hi>Pontingale</hi> wrote diuerſe Letters to the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> full of great kindneſſe and affection. But counſell was giuen the Duke, that he ſhould delay the matter no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor negociate with the King any further by letters: that it was very behooueful for him, now he had proceeded thus farre, to goe through with his affaires as ſpeedily as might be: the French men were ſubtle fellowes, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards had ſmall faithfulnes: and it might ſo fall out that the French men, by whome the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> was wholy carryed, would perſwade him to agreement with the King of <hi>Portingale</hi> vppon ſome indifferent conditions. Theſe reaſons were approoued, and therevppon the Duke ſent word to the King of <hi>Portingale</hi> that he was deſirous to ſpeak with him, whereto he condiſcended and ſo they met at a place appointed. After much communication, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ſhould ſtay all the winter at <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> ſending abrode his ſouldiers to forrey the country in the meane while, and aſſoone as the ſpring time approched, to aduance their Standards both together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemy, in what part of the Kingdome ſoeuer he remayned. Alſo that the King of <hi>Portugale</hi> ſhould take his choyce which of the Dukes daughters he would haue in marriage. He choſe <hi>Phillip</hi> the Dukes daughter by his firſt wife. The matters thus accompliſhed, the duke returned to <hi>Compoſtella.</hi> The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> being diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

by the Engliſh ſouldiers, which waſted his country and forced his townes to yeeld, meruailed much that there came no ayd all this while out of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> but the French Lords alwaies encouraged him, putting him in comfort, that aſſoone as the wars in <hi>England</hi> were diſpatched, he ſhould not faile of ſufficient ſuccours.</p>
                  <p>The French King, vppon a meruailous deſire to inuade <note place="margin">The French King maketh great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade <hi>England.</hi>

In ſo much that publicke prayers and ſupplications were daily offered to God, that he would auert and turne from them this imminent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife. All the hauens and port townes where they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the French men might land, were ſtrongly fortified and planted with Garriſons: and an vnmeaſurable maſſe of mony was leuied, amounting to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

vncertainty of winds and ſeas at that vnſeaſonable time of the yeere. His counſell preuailed, and therevppon the voyage was put of till the next ſpring; the preparation whereof ſtood <hi>Fraunce</hi> in little leſſe then thirty hundred thouſand Frankes.

And he in regard the Duke of <hi>Burbon</hi> their Generall was not yet come, thought it altogether vnfitting to fight with the enemy, but rather to beſtow their ſouldiers in places conuenient till neede ſhould require: for by this meanes it would come to paſſe, that the Engliſhmen ranging ouer all the country, through the intemperate heate of the climate, ſhould fall into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

dangerous diſeaſes: and although for the preſent they became Lords of diuerſe places, yet ſhould they not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to maintaine them long: and when their ſtrength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan once to decreaſe, it would be an eaſie matter to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all againe, eſpecially after the Duke of <hi>Burbons</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, with the reſt of their forces. This determination tooke place, and ſo immediately the men of warre were conueyd into thoſe parts of <hi>Spaine</hi> which border vppon <hi>Portugall,</hi> to defend the frontiers of the kingdome.</p>
               <p>The Conſtable who was appointed to make inuaſion vpon <hi>England,</hi> had his army prepared, and his ſhips rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy rigged in a certaine hauen of <hi>Britaine.</hi> Diuerſe other Lords of <hi>Fraunce</hi> were likewiſe ready to be embarked at <hi>Harflew</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> whoſe direction was to haue landed their forces together with his, vpon the coaſt of <hi>England.</hi> But there happened a ſuddaine aduenture in the meane time, whereby their whole enterpriſe was ouerthrowne, and that ye may the better conceiue the diſcourſe, we will rehearſe the matter from his firſt originall. It is declared before, how <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bloys</hi> being taken priſoner by the Engliſhmen that ayded the Counteſſe of <hi>Mountfort,</hi> was ſet at liberty vppon condition he ſhould pay two hundreth thouſand crownes to the King of <hi>England</hi> for his ranſom, and for aſſurance of the ſame, left his two ſonnes <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; <hi>Guy</hi> in hoſtage. It fortuned afterward that he was ſlaine in battell againſt the Duke of <hi>Britaine.</hi> After which time the Engliſhmen at the Duke of <hi>Britaines</hi> requeſt, came tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the middeſt of <hi>Fraunce</hi> with a great power to ayde him. Whereupon the French king fearing leaſt the Duke by this occaſion ſhould yield himſelfe ſubiect to the King of <hi>England,</hi> made compoſition with him as hath beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared. Whereat the Engliſhmen (who had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled a long iourney through many perills and great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, to come into <hi>Britaine)</hi> were exceedingly offended, and aſſoone as they came home, made complaint to their king of the Dukes diſcurteſie and ingratitude. And to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:5967:76"/>
the intent to worke him as great diſpleaſure, they made this offer to <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bloys,</hi> (whome they held ſtill as pledge for his fathers ranſome, his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being deceaſſed there already) that if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and holde the Duchy of <hi>Britaine</hi> of the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and doe homage and fealtie to him for the ſame, he ſhould be deliuered out of priſon, and ſet in poſſeſſion of his Dukedome, and beſides, haue in marriage <hi>Phillip</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lancaſters</hi> daughter; the ſame which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Queene of Portugall. The offer of marriage he was well contented to accept, but to ſeeme diſloyall to the French king, or be an enemy to the crowne of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> that he would neuer conſent to. Whereupon remayning ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in his reſolution, he was againe committed to priſon. Now the Conſtable of <hi>Fraunce</hi> Sir <hi>Oliuer Cliſſon,</hi> (who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his inheritance lay in <hi>Britaine,</hi> yet loued not the Duke, and the Duke on the other ſide hated him more then any man elſe, becauſe vpon the Kings commaund; he had troubled his country with warre) had a daughter whom he much deſired to marry with this <hi>Iohn</hi> that was priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in <hi>England,</hi> thinking it would be a great aduancement to his houſe if he might bring it to paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e. Therefore when he had caſt in his minde by what meanes he might beſt purchaſe his liberty, he began ſecretly to practiſe with the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> (a man whom the king highly fauoured and much delighted in his company) promiſing to giue him ſix ſcore thouſand frankes if he would vndertake to procure his enlargement. The Duke accepted his offer: not withſtanding as long as the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the relame; in regard the matter had beene motio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before for his daughter, he could effect nothing of his purpoſe. But after he was gone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of the gold, ontreated the King (with whom no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was more familiar then himſelfe) that in conſideration of his ſeruices and paines taken in the common wealth, he would beſtowe the priſoner vppon him, for whoſe raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:5967:77"/>
he might get a great maſſe of money. The king who was altogether carryed by this man, in ſuch ſorte as he both neglected and hated his vnckles in reſpect of him, did willingly condiſcend to his requeſt. Aſſoone as the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner was deliuered into his hands, he conueid him ouer to <hi>Boloine,</hi> receiuing there three ſcore thouſand frankes, the reſt to be payd him at <hi>Paris:</hi> where the Conſtable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the young mans arriuall, when he came receiued him with great honour, and married him forthwith to his daughter. How much this matter troubled the Duke of <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Britaine,</hi> he may well coniecture that remembreth the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and conſidereth the circumſtances of ſuch things as haue bene heretofore rehearſed touching the warres in <hi>Britaine.</hi> For he ſawe that by this marriage his whole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate was called in queſtion, and like to be much endaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered. Therefore he prepared reuenge, hauing the thought thereof more conuerſant in his mind, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And at ſuch time as the Conſtable had his army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him in the Dukes country, ready to haue paſſe into <hi>England</hi> as we told ye before, the Duke ſummoned all his nobility to be at <hi>Vannes</hi> by a certaine day, for weightie affaires that he had to conſult of: deſiring the Conſtable alſo by letters, that he would honour the aſſembly with his preſence. The Conſtable though he were nothing igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the mutuall grudge betweene them, yet preſuming vpon the greatneſſe of his office, and the authoritie of his preſent emploiment againſt the King enemies, came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he was requeſted. After ſome conſultation had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the matters they met for, the Duke as it were for ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and recreation, inuited certaine of the chiefe Noble men, and amongſt them alſo the Conſtable, into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine caſtle there by which he had lately begunne to build, <note place="margin">The Caſtle of <hi>Ermine.</hi>
                  </note> and now in a manner finiſhed. When they came thither, the Duke ſtoutly diſſembling his purpoſe, and himſelfe leading the Conſtable from place to place, as it had bene to doe him the more honour, at laſt brought him to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:5967:77"/>
tower of farre more ſumptuous and coſtly building then the reſt, deſiring him to view it well, and if he eſpied any fault, that he would frankely tell him his opinion. The Conſtable entred in alone, and mounting vp the firſt ſtory the dores were preſently cloſed beneath, and certaine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men ruſhing ſuddainly forth, laide hands vppon him and bound him in fetters. The hangman was likewiſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by the Dukes appointment to haue taken away his life. Neuertheleſſe at the humble entreaty and teares of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine noble man that came in his company, the Duke <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>de laval.</hi>
                  </note> hardly relenting delayed his execution, commanding him to be kept ſtreitly in yrons. But within fewe houres after, anger boyling in his breſt, &amp; admitting no other thought but reuenge, his wrath not like others being any whit aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged, but rather more vehemently encreaſed by reſpit and conſideration, he againe commanded that his head ſhould be ſtricken of. But what labour and care, what perill and difficulty he againe ſuſtained, by whoſe meanes the Conſtable had hitherto beene ſaued; how many, how ſorrowfull, how effectuall matters he alleadged, before he could moue the Dukes moſt obdurate minde to any ſenſe or feeling of compaſſion: none can conceiue but hee which knoweth that the Duke long ſince had reſolued vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon nothing more certainly then by one meanes or other, to bring the Conſtable to deſtruction; none but he which knoweth that the Duke for many yeres together had with incredible deſire hunted for this opportunity; none but he which conſidereth that it was a moſt vnnaturall &amp; outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious kinde of anger, which vpon time to muſe &amp; thinke of it, was not quenched but enflamed, and could be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with nothing, but the bloud and ſlaughter of a man which was brought in danger by deceipt, and vnder the pretence of friendſhip. Therefore that the Conſtable was ſaued from the Dukes deadly intent, next to the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the euerliuing God, he was onely to thanke this man for his deliuerance; who immediately made interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:5967:78"/>
for him, and neuer reſted till by extreame importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity he had extorted from the Duke, the aſſurance of his friends life and ſafety. So at length the Duke was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſet the Conſtable at liberty, vppon condition that he ſhould pay him an hundreth thouſand crownes before he departed, and deliuer three caſtles into his hands, to remaine to him and his heires for euer. Wherof aſſoone as the Duke had taken poſſeſſion, he diſmiſſed his priſoner, who within two dayes after came to <hi>Paris</hi> &amp; made greuous complaint to the King of the great iniurie and violence he had ſuffered. The king gaue him comfort and hope of redreſſe, but the Kings vnckles vppon rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the circumſtances, were ſo farre from pittying his miſchaunce, that they rather ſeemed angry and offended, becauſe when he had all things in a readineſſe for his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he neglected his affaires and the opportunity of the ſeaſon, to followe matters of pleaſure and idle diſporte, giuing raſh credyt to ſuch a one, as both he himſelfe hated, and who he knew well enough, had long ſince ſought ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of his life. The Admirall and the reſt of the Lords which were ready to take ſhipping in <hi>Normandy,</hi> vppon vnderſtanding of theſe occurrents, diſmiſſed their forces. So it came to paſſe that this expedition againſt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which by the generall conſent and good liking of the whole kingdome had beene moſt certainly reſolued and concluded vppon, was by theſe occaſions that yee haue heard, vtterly ouerthrowne and diſappointed. At the ſame time alſo the young Duke of <hi>Gelders</hi> proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">1390.</note> warres againſt the French King, and ſent him his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance: for the king of <hi>England,</hi> for ſo doing had giuen him a penſion of foure thouſand frankes.</p>
               <p>The chiefe motiues that ſtirred the Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> to this fact before mentioned, were firſt the mortall hatred he bare to the Conſtable: and ſecondly, that he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reconcile himſelfe to the King of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure he had mightily procured by entring in league
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:5967:78"/>
with the French King. Moſt part of the noblemen of <hi>Fraunce</hi> perſwaded the King in the Conſtables behalfe, that he ſhould not ſuffer ſuch a deed to eſcape vnpuniſhed. Herevpon meſſengers were ſent to the Duke, to let him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that both the King and his vncles and the whole counſell of ſtate were highly offended with him, becauſe through his violent apprehenſion and detayning of the Conſtable, he had fruſtrated the kings purpoſe of inuading his enemies. Wherefore their will and pleaſure was, that he ſhould make full reſtitution both of the mony and caſtles which he had wrongfully taken: and concerning his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of the voyage, that he ſhould come in perſon to <hi>Paris,</hi> there to render an account of his doings. The duke when he had receiued this meſſage, after ſome delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the matter, made anſwere to this effect: that he not only nothing repented him of what he had done to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, but was alſo exceeding ſory that he did no more, and that it greeued him at the heart as often as he reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred it, that euer he ſuffered him to go away aliue. As for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſeeing he had them in his poſſeſſion, he would by no meanes reſtore them againe, nor neuer depart with them vnles the King put him out by force. The mony was all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed amongſt thoſe that helpt him to defend his country againſt the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtable, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whome he had not a more mortall enemy in the world. For interrupring the iourney into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he had neuer any ſuch thought in his mind, it was a priuate caſe between the Conſtable and him, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer was done, proceeded of no other intent, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of reuenge.</p>
               <p>Yee haue heard, how at ſuch time as inuaſion was feared in <hi>England,</hi> great ſummes of money were leuied for the maintenance of war, to defend the Realme. Now, when the French men altering their purpoſe, returned without performance of their enterpriſe, many gaue out ſpeeches that it was vniuſtly done of the kings officers to keepe ſtill the mony, the daunger being auoyded without any charge
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:5967:79"/>
or expences. This muttering being ſtilled for a while, vppon occaſion of a new ſubſidy demaunded for payment of the ſouldiers wages which had byn placed in garriſons, was againe renued more boldly then before. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons tooke the matter very haynouſly, and framed grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous accuſations againſt certaine perſons, through whoſe diſhoneſty and vnfaithfulnes, they ſaid the whole treaſure of the kingdome, and the goods of the ſubiects, were waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſumed. The King was led altogether by a few of the meaner ſort, men of baſe quality and ignorant diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But eſpecially, the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> had him in a manner at command, and poſſeſt him in ſuch ſort, as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med he had enchaunted the young kings affections. For whatſoeuer he ſayd was done, and there was nothing ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt or contrary to reaſon, which the King would not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit vppon his report. He brought the kings vncles in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition and hatred, ſo as they had much ado to keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues out of daunger. As for them, they were nothing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the peoples complaints: for by this occaſion they ſaw many alterations would happen. Therfore they inclined to the people, allowing their pretence, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them to proceed as they had already begunne.

                  </note> concluſion it came to this paſſe, that at a certaine time when the King and his nobility were aſſembled together, the Londoners made grieuous complaint of the new ſubſidies and exactions which from time to time were impoſed vpon them: and which grieued them moſt of all, that they ſaw no good or neceſſary vſe wherto all that mony was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They thought the King was not made priuy to any thing, and therefore they required that a day might be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the kings collectors and receiuors to yeeld an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their receits and payments, whereby it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, who had carryed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vprightly in their office, &amp; who otherwiſe, that the one might be retained, &amp; the other diſcharged. The Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> one of the kings vncles, had giuen them counſell &amp; direction to frame their ſpeech
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:5967:79"/>
in this manner. But the King aſſoone as he heard their ſute, reiected it at the firſt, and would haue put of his aunſwere till another time. But the people ſtill vrged their demaund, and preſſed vpon him with more earneſtnes, becauſe many of the noble men about him did ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly allow of their petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So at length he was contented, that within a few daies after an account ſhould be taken of all thoſe officers, and that his vncles and certaine other whome the people required, ſhould haue the examination of the matter. In many of the officers was found great fraud and extortion, all which the law condemned to death. Immediatly vppon receit of the accompts, the King accompanyed with his minion the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> tooke his iourney into another part of the Realme. Where vnderſtanding that certaine of his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold were put to execution at <hi>London,</hi> he was exceedingly mooued to diſpleaſure both againſt the commons, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his vncles. For the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> had as it were imprinted this conceit in his mind, that they went about to depoſe him from his crowne, and therefore neuer ceaſed to incenſe and prouoke him (who of himſelfe was too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſiue of ſuch occaſions) till he had perſwaded him to make warre againſt them. So the Duke was made general, and by the Kings appointment leuied ſome fifteene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men.

                     <hi>Sir</hi> Robert Treſilian.</note> of a marchant, to <hi>London,</hi> where the kings vncles were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, to diſcouer their counſels and manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. But this gentleman (moſt contrary to his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) I wot not by what misfortune, was diſcouered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and when he had reuealed to the Lords certaine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the King, he was put to death. This occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as ye may well coniecture, did mightily aggrauate the kings diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>Now, when the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſaw the power of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries approching againſt him, as fierce and ſlout as he ſeemed before, yet performed he nothing worthy of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:5967:80"/>
or diſcreet commaunder. For he was abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded out of a ſelfe-guilty opinion of his own deſert, that if it were his fortune to be taken in battell, there would be no other way with him, but death. Therefore aſſoone as he had placed his men in order, he began to prouide for his own ſecurity, retyring into the rereward, to the intent that as occaſion ſhould ſerue, he might be the readyer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uay himſelfe out of daunger. The ſouldiers hearing a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine rumor that their Generall had forſaken them, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned themſelues preſently to flight, without exchanging any ſtroke with their enemy. Very fewe were ſlaine, and <note place="margin">

For albeit he had the King wholy on his ſide, yet he much miſtruſted and feared his vncles, of whome he had ſo well deſerued, that nothing but vtter enmity was to be expected at their hands. Theſe troubles being thus qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, and the noble men yet hearing no newes of the King; it was thought conuenient, that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie</hi> ſhould be addreſſed vnto him in the name of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles &amp; the people, ſignifying how they were al very deſirous of his preſence, and that if it pleaſed him to repaire to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> he ſhould be honourably and louingly receiued. For they ſought nothing but the wel-fare and tranquility of the kingdome, which it was impoſſible for him to maintaine without the good willes of his ſubiects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That it was not without cauſes of great importance, that ſome were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed, and others driuen out of the realme; for as much as through the authority and ill gonernment of thoſe perſons, the honour of the kingdome was impaired. What the noblemen had done in that behalfe, was for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good of the common wealth, and as the ſtate then ſtood that it was a matter of neceſſity, and therefore he had no iuſt cauſe of diſpleaſure againſt them. Although the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:5967:80"/>
King were highly offended with the occaſions which had paſſed before: yet vpon theſe and ſuch other reaſons as the Archbiſhop vſed, he was perſwaded to come to <hi>London.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had remayned there a while, a Parliament was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where the Lords and Prelates of the realme renued their othe of allegiance to him, which they had formerly ſworne to his vncles in his behalfe: for he was now attayned to the age of one and twenty yeeres, the age accuſtomably preſcribed for the adminiſtration of publicke affaires.</p>
               <p>In this meane while, the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ſubdued may townes in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> was not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle but in an other part of the country, brought much into his father in lawes ſubiection. And when they had practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this kind of warre-fare for a time, at length they ioyned their forces together, to giue their enemies battell in the field. The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> in the meane ſeaſon meruailed much at the Duke of <hi>Burbons</hi> long tariance and delay, whoſe only comming he had waited for all this while with ſo great expectation. The French mens aduiſe being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine demaunded, they perſiſted reſolute in their firſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, holding it altogether vnexpedient to giue the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen battell, though they had gotten many townes, for thoſe might eaſily be recouered hereafter: and it muſt needs come to paſſe, that the Engliſhmen being tyred with the continuall trauels of warre, ſometimes ouercome with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of heate, otherwhiles enfeebled through the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie of the piercing ayre entring in at the open pores of their bodies, ſhould fall into ſundry diſeaſes and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

The King of <hi>Portugales</hi> counſell being asked in this neceſſity, he thought it beſt in regard of the intemperatenes of the ſeaſon, to withdraw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome of the townes which they had taken, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the army. The Duke on the other ſide feared leaſt when their ſouldiers were diſperſed, the Duke of <hi>Burbon</hi> whome he knew to be comming, ſhould ſurpriſe them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares. Wherevppon reſoluing as yet not to breake vp their campe, they continued ſtill in the field. But it was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable to behold the Engliſh, who being altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed to the intollerable heat of that country, and the drinking of thoſe hot wines, were ſo afflicted with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that the poore wretches with great miſery had much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe to ſuſtaine their liues. Then the generall of the horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who could both heare and diſcerne the ſtate of the <note place="margin">

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon it was concluded to diſmiſſe the army, at the tydings wherof, there was great reioycing through the whole ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe. Neuertheles they ſaw no meanes how to returne into their country.

An herauld was ſent to the enemie, to require a ſafe conduct for certaine Engliſh gentlemen, to come and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the King. The Spanyard muſing what ſtraunge occaſion ſhould moue them, admitted their requeſt: the effect whereof was this: That for as much as their whole army was greeuouſly viſited with ſicknes, the King calling
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:5967:81"/>
to remembrance the miſeries of mankind, which are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all, would giue leaue to their ſicke perſons to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelues into ſome of his townes, &amp; to abide there till their health might be recouered. And for the reſt which were deſirous to returne into their countrey, that he would graunt them licence to paſſe quietly through his kingdome of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and withall to be a meanes to the kings of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> that they would likewiſe ſuffer them to trauel in ſafety through their dominions. The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> after deliberation, condiſcended to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt vpon condition, that aſwel thoſe which went now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards their Countrey, as the reſt that ſtayed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of their health, ſhould at their departure be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſworne, neither to returne any more to the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> nor to come within the confines of <hi>Spaine</hi> vppon any occaſion of warre, for the ſpace of ſix yeeres after. Theſe conditions though they ſeemed greeuous vnto them, yet ſo earneſt was their deſire and affection home-wards, as they would willingly haue accepted them, had they beene much worſe. The Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> who had compaſſed this matter by collaterall meanes in another mans name, leaſt he ſhould ſeeme to haue craued ought at his enemies handes, after the diſſoluing of his army, departed againe to <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> diſperſing his ſicke people into the townes and villages there adioyning. Of thoſe that went for <hi>England,</hi> diuers Lords and Gentlemen, beſide great numbers of the common ſort, being vnable to ſuſtaine the violence of their diſeaſe, and the trauell of their iourney, ended their liues in the way. In the meane time the Duke of <hi>Burbon</hi> who had lingred a long while, and fetched a great compaſſe (for he had viſited Pope <hi>Clement</hi> at <hi>Avinion)</hi> arriued in <hi>Spaine:</hi> and although he heard tydings of the diſſoluing of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh army, yet neuertheles in regard he had proceeded thus farre, he would not now goe out of the country before he had ſeen the King.

be admitted, they would demaund entertainment, which if he ſhould deny them, they would rob and ſpoyle his country: therefore within few dayes after the Dukes comming thither (whome otherwiſe he receiued with all honour and curteſie) he declared vnto him, how at that time the enemy being deprarted of his owne accord, he had no further imployment for ſorraine ſouldiets. The Duke was not only nothing offended with this diſcharge, but very glad of the occaſion to be ſoone diſpatched, for he found the countrey did not agree with his peoples com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. The Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> lay ſicke a while at <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postella,</hi> and vppon the recouery of his ſtrength, hearing of the Duke of <hi>Burbons</hi> departure, he alſo ſet his mind vppon returning into his country: for he well perceiued, that by reaſon of theſe calamities and afflictions, he was vtterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from going through with his enterpriſe.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and ryot, had much impoueriſhed his eſtate; and when by reaſon of his wants, hee could hardly maintaine the reputation of his calling, in this diſtreſſe he repayred to his vncle the Archbiſhop of <hi>Colen</hi> for counſell. The Biſhop after ſo ſharpe reprehenſion, vſed theſe, or the like ſpeeches. Couſen, you ſee and perceiue wel-enough that there is not any Prince, nor noble man of ſo ſmall account, which will beſtowe his daughter with you in marriage, you haue ſo ſpent &amp; conſumed your means, and ſet your ſelfe ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in debt. But there is a rich merchant, <hi>Bertold</hi> of <note place="margin">Bertold <hi>of</hi> Machline.</note> 
                  <hi>Machline,</hi> which you know hath but one only daughter, to whome in expectation of her large dowry, many great Lords haue beene ſuters. You cannot make a better match for your ſelfe than to ſeize vpon ſuch a booty. You ſhall do well therefore to make this offer to her father: that if hee will vndertake with his mony to redeeme thoſe townes and caſtles which you haue pawned to your creditors, and withall be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to releaſe ſuch bonds of debt as he hath of yours already, in conſideration hereof you will take his daughter to wife. This counſell was well accepted of the Earle, and ſo he ſent one to make the motion. When <hi>Bertold</hi> had receiued the meſſage, his anſwere was this: that he ſhould hold it a great honour both to himſelfe and all his houſe, if his daughter might ſeem worthy to be matched with ſuch a husband: the reſpects which he thought moued the Earle to deſire it, were that he might be diſcharged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the danger of his creditors, and poſſeſſe his owne without controlment. Therefore he was well content to proceede with the marriage, and diſlikte not of the conditions profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo as theſe likewiſe for his part might be added: that if it fortuned the Earle to dye firſt, leauing no iſſue, then all his poſſeſſions to remaine entirely to his wife during her life. And if it happened her to die firſt, leauing iſſue
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:5967:83"/>
by the Earle, that then her children ſhould be admitted to their fathers inheritance, and not be debarred of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, though he ſhould afterward marry a woman of more honourable birth, and haue iſſue by her alſo. Theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being accepted, <hi>Marie</hi> the daughter of <hi>Bertold</hi> was marryed to the Earle of <hi>Gelders,</hi> and the fourth yeere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">

This <hi>Iſabell</hi> was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in marriage to <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bloys,</hi> who had much altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his aduerſaries about the inheritance, and great contention was like to haue growne betweene them, ſo farre forth as the matter had ſurely come to tryall of the ſword, but that by his wiues departure in the mean ſeaſon, the controuerſie was decided.

                  <hi>Charles</hi> king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> about this time ſeſſing his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at a ſubſidy of two hundred thouſand franks, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the burgeſſes of his townes at <hi>Pampelone</hi> the chiefe Citty of his kingdome: and when he ſaw that they ſtucke vppon the matter, he ſhut them vp in a certaine court en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed about with high walles, threatning that if they concluded not the ſooner, he would handle them according to their deſerts. But in the meane while happened a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull accident. After he had left them in this angry moode, he gaue himſelfe to ſleepe: and becauſe he was aged, his ſeruants were accuſtomed to burne a perfume a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, to prouoke him to ſweat. Now it fortuned (by what negligence or miſchaunce at that time I know not) that ſome ſparke of fire caught hold of the bed; which by little and little encreaſing and gathering ſtrength, at <note place="margin">

               <p>Many Lords of <hi>Fraunce</hi> which were much diſpleaſed that the Duke of <hi>Gelders</hi> had made defiance to their king in ſuch proud termes, contrary to the cuſtome of other Princes, were of opinion, that if he ſhould eſcape cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away withall, it might perhaps hereafter be imputed as a blame and reproch to them which were now of the kings counſell.

Therefore their beſt aduiſe was, that he ſhould of his owne accord, reſtore againe to the Conſtable the caſtles which he had lately taken from him. For it would be more honourable for him to deliuer them now willingly, then hereafter by compulſion. The Duke following their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoreth all that he had taken from the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> made reſtitution of all, and beſides, put euery officer in his place againe, as he found them when he firſt ſeized the caſtles into his poſſeſſion.

The Duke as one that was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant how great enemies he had about the King, namely the Conſtable, and <hi>Iohn</hi> his Son lately ſet free out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> diſcreetly and earneſtly excuſed himſelfe.

all mens affections generally enſtranged from the voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Spaine,</hi> it was a mighty greefe and corroſiue to his heart, conſidering with himſelfe how ſtrong and well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed an army he had brought forth againſt his enemy, through the puiſſance whereof, he had conquered no ſmall number of townes and fortreſſes: and afterward how cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly fortune had dealt with him and his, ouerthrowing the whole courſe of his proceedings in ſuch ſort, as he ſawe no poſſible meanes left, how euer to obtaine his inheritance of the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> In muſing vpon this his misfortune, he compared it to that calamity which the Duke of <hi>Aniow</hi> ſuffered in <hi>Calabria,</hi> who being come into <hi>Italy</hi> vpon large hopes and great expectation, not only fayled of the endes whereto he aſpired, but ſpent his life alſo in the purſute of his enterpriſe. This only was a comfort to him in all his diſcouragements, that he had a daughter by his wife <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> whome he thought ſome French Lord of high eſtate, eyther in reſpect of her birth or poſſibility, would deſire to haue in marriage. Now the Duke of <hi>Berry</hi> was at the ſame time a widdower, and his freinds now and then diſcourſing with him about a wife, amongſt others mentioned alſo the Duke of <hi>Lancaſters</hi> daughter. The Duke preſently began to conceiue ſome good affection that way, and therevppon aduertiſed the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> of his intent: whome when he had found nothing ſtrange in the matter, he ſent Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners againe to negotiate with him further in that behalfe.

thoſe nations vniting their forces together, would make warres vppon <hi>Spaine,</hi> and ſo conuey the poſſeſſion of the crowne to the Duke of <hi>Lancaſters</hi> wife. Wherefore, vpon aduiſe which his counſell, it was thought good to make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret motion, that the Duke of <hi>Lancaſters</hi> daughter might be giuen in marriage to <hi>Henrie</hi> his ſonne, whome hee had by the King of <hi>Arragons</hi> daughter. Herevpon a ſew were ſent, and thoſe ſlenderly accompanyed, leaſt the French men by whoſe friendſhip he poſſeſſed his kingdome, ſhould come to any knowledge of the buſineſſe intended. The Duke gaue good eare to their meſſage. And yet he put the French commiſſioners ſtill in great hope, euer making this exception, that he would go through with nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent and approbation of the King of <hi>England</hi> his nephew, to whome he had wholy referred the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe matters: and with this anſwere he diſmiſt them. But he carryed himſelfe much more familiarly towards the Spaniards, through his wiues procurement, who ſawe by this meanes, that her daughter without any empeachment or difficulty, ſhould orderly ſucceed in the inheritance of that flouriſhing kingdome, for the obtayning whereof ſo many travailes and painefull aduentures had been ſuſtained by her husband.</p>
               <p>The hatred kindled euery day more and more, betweene the <hi>Brabanders</hi> and <hi>Gelders;</hi> and the <hi>Brabanders</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling about fortie thouſand men, beſieged <hi>Graue</hi> a towne <note place="margin">

               <p>The French king being exceedingly deſirous to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement of the Duke of <hi>Gelders</hi> for thoſe arrogant and reprochfull Letters he had ſent him, raiſed a mighty armie. Many diſſwaded him from this voiage, and among the reſt, his vncles; but becauſe the duke of <hi>Brittaine</hi> was now fully concluded withall, inſomuch that he had repayd the money alſo that he had taken from the Conſtable, the King would not by any meanes omit the preſent occaſion of accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing his purpoſe.

Dutcheſſe her ſelfe was well contented it ſhould be ſo; but all the people beſides, ſtoode ſtowtly againſt it, and were readie to defend their frontires from admitting ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as being once receiued, would doe no leſſe harme and annoyance to the country, than if their enemies ſhould waſte and ſpoile it.

The King was not much againſt his requeſt, ſo the duke himſelfe would come and ſhew how the matters which he alleaged for his excuſe, were iuſt and reaſonable. The duke being brought to the Kings preſence, proteſted that hee neither counſelled his ſonne to make that defiance, nor had anie knowledge thereof before the letters were ſent. And for confirmation of his innocencie in this caſe, promiſed that hee would perſwade with his ſonne, to make his purgation aduiſedly before the King, and deſire him of pardon:

which thing if hee could not effect, hee would ſet open all his townes to the King, that by meanes thereof hee might accompliſh his warres with more aduantage.

               <p>When the Scottiſh men vnderſtoode that diſcord was hatching in <hi>England,</hi> and by continuance of time had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered greater ſtrength, being daily more and more aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, to the intent to reuenge olde iniuries, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the King with their purpoſe, they aſſembled to the number of fortie thouſand men.

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> (as we ſhewed before) kept the duke of <hi>Berry</hi> ſtill a ſuter in great exſpectation, and yet he was all the while more affected to the Spaniard. Amongſt other doubts which he caſt, this was one: that if the Duke of <hi>Berry</hi> ſhould fortune to die, his daughter ſhould then remaine but a poore Lady in reſpect of her other ſiſters, for the duke had children by his firſt wife, which doubtleſſe would goe away with the greateſt part of his eſtate. When the French King vnderſtoode how the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> had put in a barre againſt the duke of <hi>Berrios</hi> proceedings, hee was wonderfully offended; ſo was the whole Counſell of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> who knew well how highly <hi>Spaine</hi> was bound to the Kings of <hi>Fraunce</hi> for great benefites receiued many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges together.

               <p>This ingratitude therefore being generally taken in very ill part, Ambaſſadours were addreſſed to the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> with this meſſage. That he ſhould take good aduiſement

So he tooke his iourney through <hi>Campaigne, Burgoigne,</hi> and other prouinces till he came to <hi>Avinion:</hi> and when he had viſited the Pope, went from thence to <hi>Mountpelyer.</hi> Which Citty although by reaſon of traſicke and merchandize it be very wealthy, yet it had been ſo oppreſſed with tributes and exactions, that as then it was much impoueriſhed.

               <p>The Moores and Barbarians made often excurſions vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the <hi>Genowaies,</hi> and the Citties and Ilands vnder their ſubjection. Which thing they might more commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe, becauſe vppon the confines, comming from <hi>Genoa</hi>

And becauſe they vnderſtood there was a truce lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between <hi>Fraunce, England,</hi> and the kingdomes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confederate, they ſent ambaſſadours to the French King, requiring him of ſuccour. The King was ſo inclinable to this warre, that he not only vndertooke it himſelfe, but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited diuers of his neighbour Princes, to ſet their helping hands to performance of the enterpriſe. Therefore aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <note place="margin">1390.

Theſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſhipping together at <hi>Genoa,</hi> at length ouercame the contrary waues and tempeſts which encountred them at ſea, and arriued ſafely in their enemies country. Now as the Moores were conſulting, becauſe they ſaw that the <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes</hi> vppon this redoubling of their puiſſance, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the french and other forraine nations to their ayd, would beſiege their Citty; a certaine graue old man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, deſcended of a noble family, gaue counſell in this manner. That they ſhould not giue battell to their enemies, in regard of their great number; but rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them quietly to encampe and ſettle themſelues before the Citty; for it was ſtrong ynough to abide the violence of their ſiege for a long ſeaſon. Therefore let their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies roaſt themſelues abroad in the heate of the ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſunne beames, whilſt they being fenced from the iniury of the weather, with houſes and ſhadowy places,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:5967:91"/>
reſted at their eaſe within the Citty. For it would come to paſſe, that when their prouiſion by little and little was conſumed, themſelues tormented with heate, and tyred with a thouſand other diſcommodities, they would get home againe without ſpeeding of their purpoſe. The olde mans counſell was well liked, and the citty being beſieged both by ſea and land, many light skirmiſhes were daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanged. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſent an Ambaſſador deſiring to knowe for what cauſes this warre was mooued againſt them. The French men made anſwere, that the chiefe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, becauſe their forefathers had put the Sauiour of the world to a ſhameful death, for that they excluded bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, were blaſphemers of God, and ſpake vnreuerently of the holy Virgine mother of Chriſt: theſe were the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions why they bent their forces againſt them, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemies of chriſtendome. This anſwer ſeemed but a mockery to the <hi>Moores,</hi> ſo farre were they from any thoght of miſliking their religion. The <hi>Sicillians</hi> and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries neere adioyning brought corne, wine and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion aboundantly into the campe of the beſiegers. But by reaſon of the hoteneſſe of thoſe countrey wines, and the extreame intemperateneſſe of the ayre, it could not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe but that very many fell into moſt dangerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. Amongſt theſe inconueniences the duke of <hi>Burbon</hi> now altogether out of ſeaſon beeing haughty, prowde and cruell, and ſuch a one as no man almoſt might preſume in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his preſence, would remitte no parte of his ſeueritie: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that through his default, ſhewing himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies rough and intractable, many notable exploits were omitted. After two moneths ſiege, when they had beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed all their labour in vaine, virtaile waxing ſcant, and ſcarcitie being feared, becauſe the winter approched and their watching grew painefull (for the <hi>Barbarians</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually moleſt them in the night) the peſtilence being alſo miſtruſted to hang ouer their heads, moſt were of opinion, that the beſt courſe was, to diſſolue the army. This alſo was
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:5967:92"/>
another thing which they ſuſpected, that the <hi>Genowayes</hi> perhaps might fall to agreement with their enemies, and ther was already ſuch a rumor ſpread through al the camp. Vpon theſe conſiderations therefore the French men ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ſiege (which greatly diſpleſed the <hi>Genowais)</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed themſelues homeward. Wherupon the <hi>Barbarians</hi> reſuming greater courage, began to conceiue large hopes and to promiſe themſelues the performance of great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters heereafter. And that they might be able to repulſe their enemies with greater force another time, they ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in league with the Princes that bordered about them.</p>

The Captaine of thoſe horſemen being a skilfull man of armes, after he had laine a while at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> iſſued forth one day with 300. horſe to draw his enemies to ſome diſaduantage: for he knew well they would proffer ſome
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:5967:92"/>
skirmiſh to the towneſ-men. Therfore at his going out he gaue commandement, that in their fight they ſhould retire from the enemy, and ſuffer him to purſue them, till they had drawne him within compaſſe of their danger. He was nothing deceiued in his opinion: for as they were skirmiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their ordinary maner, the towneſmen gaue backe till they came to the place where their fellowes lay in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh, who incontinently brake foorth with great violence. The French men thus vnexpectedly engaged, behaued themſelues with great courage and valour: but being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwearied with trauell, and faint with heate of the Sunne, they were vnable to ſuſtaine the reviewed force and fury of their enemies. The Earle himſelfe hauing gotten out of the preaſſe to take ayre, found a brooke there by, whereof he drunke ſo aboundantly, that he was ſodainely taken with ſuch a ſickneſſe, as both preſently bereft him of his ſpeech, and within few houres after, of his life. His ſouldiers by this means diſcouraged, made as much haſte as they could to get themſelues out of <hi>Italy.</hi> But many of them being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted &amp; ſlaine in their paſſage, the reſt when they came to the confines of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> were by the Kings commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement prohibited to enter.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Britaine,</hi> who had larely beene at <hi>Paris,</hi> and done his homage according to the cuſtome, being vnable to change the diſpoſition of his nature, though he had bin oftentimes reconciled to the French King, yet in his heart he could not chooſe but hate him, and loue the King of <hi>England</hi> At ſuch time as this attonement was made at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> hee promiſed from thencefoorth to become a Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine. But aſſoone as hee was returned into his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, hee performed nothing leſſe. And when the Kings Officers were ſent vnto him, hee would not admit them to his preſence: carying himſelfe altogether in ſuch a faſhion, as it might plainely appeare hee ſought new occaſions of warre and contention. Many counſelled the King to leuie armes againſt him, to abate his pride and arrogancie, which
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:5967:93"/>
was in tollerable. But the Kings vncles, and eſpecially the Duke of <hi>Burgoigne</hi> (whoſe wife was the Duke of <hi>Britaines</hi> kinſwoman) employed their trauell to this effect, that a day certaine might be aſſigned for communication. So a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was had at <hi>Tours:</hi> and certaine pointes were there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, wherein the Duke might ſeeme to haue contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the kings authority.

Such difference and alteration was about the matter, that it ſeemed not likely to be otherwiſe ended, than by the ſword. Neuertheleſſe, in concluſion a meanes was found to make amity and peace betweene them. The French king gaue his daughter in marriage to the Duke of <hi>Brittaines</hi> ſonne: and the ſonne of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Bloys</hi> (the Conſtables ſon in lawe) married the Duke of <hi>Britaines</hi> daughter.

Aſſoone as the Earle was dead, there wanted not ſome to perſwade the King, that in regard he deceaſſed without iſſue, and was indebted to him ſo great a ſumme of money, he ſhould ſeize all the Earldome into his owne poſſeſſion.

But it was generally thought neceſſary, that the church ſhould firſt be ſetled in quiet, before this expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were vndertaken.

And becauſe in theſe affaires of ſo great conſequence, the King alone had not authority ſufficient to confirme the articles of peace, though he likte them neuer ſo well, without conſent of the three eſtates of his kingdome aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Parliament; it was agreed, that to the former, three yeeres truce, another tweluemonth ſhould be added, that in the meane time conuenient leiſure might be had, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and determine of the matter at large.

               <p>The french King made an exchange with his brother <hi>Lewis,</hi> for the Duke dome of <hi>Toureine,</hi> in liev whereof he gaue him the duke dome of <hi>Orleance</hi> which was much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but with this condition, that all his heyres and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours ſhould do homage and fealty to the Kings of <hi>Fraunce</hi> for the ſame.</p>

For howſoeuer the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent were a faithfull and aſſured friend to the Engliſh men, yet things could not alwayes continue at one ſtay: and it might happen heereafter, that hee ſhould conclude ſome league, or agree vpon ſome marriage with the Frenchmen, Britons, Burgonions, or others, according as time ſhould ſerue, and his owne affaires require: whereby it might come to paſſe, that the Dukedome of <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> which by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine peculiar prerogatiue was now annexed to the crown of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be transferred to a ſtrange Lord, and from thenceforth loſt all their ancient aliance and ſocietie with the Engliſh nation.

Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bauier</hi> being elected Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, when he could not obtaine his confirmation from the Pope, went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there of his owne authority crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting another Pope, and certaine Cardinalles, was by him inueſted in his imperiall dignity: and afterward permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:5967:99"/>
his ſouldiers to take the payment of their wages out of the ſpoyle of the Citty. <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lutzemburge,</hi> was created Emperour againſt this <hi>Lewis.</hi> Which <hi>Charles</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming newly into <hi>Italy</hi> from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſgraue</hi> where he had receiued his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Pope, this Archbiſhop of <hi>Millaine</hi> entertayned him with great curteſie, and did him all the honour he could, lending him mony alſo at his departure, to the ſum of an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crownes. The Emperour in conſideration hereof, and to ſhew his gratefull mind, created the Archbiſhop, Vicount of <hi>Millaine,</hi> and gaue to him and to his nephews after him, all that ſeigniory, to hold and enioy the ſame, till ſuch time as the Emperour ſhould redeeme it againe by repaiment of the whole ſum which he had borrowed.

So when they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>idde their elder brother of his life, they made equall partitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and rayned puiſſantly by force and policy. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas</hi> in regard he was the elder, had tenne townes, and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> had nine. <hi>Millaine</hi> it ſelfe was indifferently allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them both, the one to haue it one yeare, and the other another, by turnes. They leuyed ſubſidies and taxes of their people from time to time, by moſt vniuſt and violent meanes. Such fortreſſes as either of them held, they furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Garriſons of forraine ſouldiers, of all nations but their own, whome they principally diſtruſted. Through compulſion and rigour they kept the people in great awe and ſubiection, exacting moſt cruell puniſhment vpon ſuch as ſtirred neuer ſo little againſt them, to the intent to terrify others by their example. They purchaſed the alliance of Princes with great ſummes of mony. <hi>Galeas</hi> paid to the Earle of <hi>Sauoy</hi> whoſe ſiſter he married, an 100000 crowns.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:5967:99"/>
This <hi>Galeas</hi> had like wiſe a ſonne of his own name that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed the daughter of <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> who in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hereof, departed with ſix hundred thouſand frankes towards the payment of his father in lawes ranſome, to the King of <hi>England. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alentine</hi> the daughter of this younger <hi>Galeas,</hi> was marryed to <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> brother to the French King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt: but her father firſt paied to him that ſhould be his ſonne in law, tenne hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand franks, ſurely a wonderfull ſumme of mony: with part whereof the Earledome of <hi>Bloys</hi> was purchaſed, as we haue heretofore declared.</p>
               <p>Betweene the two brothers there was no contention, as long as they liued together. But the younger <hi>Galeas</hi> after his fathers deceaſſe, ſurpriſed his vncle <hi>Barnabas</hi> by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſlew him.</p>
               <p>One of this <hi>Barnabas</hi> daughters was married to <hi>Stephon</hi> Duke of <hi>Bauier,</hi> and brought forth a daughter named <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi> who afterward became the wife of <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> as is mentioned in this hiſtory already. <hi>Galeas</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 127.</note> hauing thus trecherouſly ſlaine his vncle, was not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, but perſecuted euen his childrens children, and all their generation, ſeizing into his hands all their goods and poſſeſſions. Alſo he burthened the people with grieuous and continuall exactions.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, he held a wicked and vnreuerent opinion concerning the Godhead. So he might enrich himſelfe and aduance his authority, he regarded not by what means it were effected. Amongſt other precepts of good doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine wherewith he was plentifully inſtructed, he was alſo miſ-led in this opinion, and tooke it as hereditary from his anceſtors, vtterly ro deſpiſe the Popes authority, and to reioyce exceedingly when any diſſention happened in the church. Now the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> wife being a very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious woman, was not a little faine and deſirous that her husband might attaine to the Crowne, by what meanes ſhee did not greatly regard. Herevppon many ſuſpected

that the kings mind had beene all this while enchaunted by her witch-craft. The ground of the ſuſpition grew vppon this occaſion. Shee had a Sonne by her husband, a fayre young child, much about the age of the <hi>Dolphin.</hi> As theſe two children were ſporting together in a chamber, a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned appell was caſt in amongſt them, on that ſide where the kings ſonne was: but the child (which may ſeeme a wonder) refuſed to meddle withall. Then the other when no body perceiued him, caught it vp, and within a little while after he had eaten of it, through the violent operation of the poyſon, yeelded vp the ghoſt. The report hereof was preſently carried to the Court, and ſoone diſperſed ouer all the country. This alſo was another thing which encreaſed the ſuſpition, that during all the time of the Kings ſicknes, he would endure neyther the Queene, nor any other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to come about him, but only this Ducheſſe of <hi>Orleans.</hi> By theſe occaſions, mens minds being meruailouſly incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhee was conueyed from the Court to a certaine caſtle not farre from <hi>Paris,</hi> and there reſtrayned of her liberty. Beſides, her husband conceiued great diſpleaſure againſt her about the death of his ſonne. When <hi>Galeas</hi> of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine</hi> vnderſtood how his daughter was entreated, he was highly offended, and ſent ambaſſadours forthwith into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> where they found nothing ſo friendly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as he expected. Therefore about ſuch time as the voyage was vndertaken into <hi>Hungarie,</hi> he proclaymed warres againſt the French King: and the more to grieue his enemy, entred in league with <hi>Baſan</hi> the Turke, and made him acquainted both with his owne affaires, and with the ſtate of <hi>Fraunce.</hi>

After the conſummation of theſe nuptialles the French King was purpoſed to haue made inuaſion vppon the Dukedome of <hi>Millaine;</hi> and the King of <hi>England</hi> had already promiſed to ayde him with ſix thouſand archers. But there happened a matter in the mean time, which gaue
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:5967:101"/>
occaſion of new deliberation.</p>
               <p>The Hungarians and French men together had ſtrongly beſieged <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> and conceiued good hope, that in ſhort ſpace they ſhould become Lords of the Citty. In the meane while <hi>Baſam</hi> the Turkiſh King, aſſembled out of his owne dominions and the countries of Princes adioyning, about two hundred thouſand men. He ſent almoſt eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand before, and deuided the reſt of his whole army into two battelles. Aſſoone as our men were aduertiſed of their comming, they preſently prepared to meete them. And becauſe the ſcowtes which they had ſent forth to diſcouer, reported that the enemies were but a ſmall number, (for they had ſeene no more then thoſe eight thouſand fore-ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) the French men in great heate made haſt to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. As they were thus in a readineſſe, the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> ſent them word, that they ſhould not be too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for he miſtruſted the ſcowts had not taken a ful view of their enemies forces: and that he had ſent out ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers better acquainted with the coaſts of the country, who within few houres would aſſuredly returne and bring more certain intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The Lord <hi>Cowcy</hi> &amp; many others alowed this aduise, and thought it neceſſary by all meanes to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. But the Conſtable <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Artoys,</hi> becauſe his opinion was not firſt demaunded, prowdly and peruerſly <note place="margin">One mans pride, cauſeth many mens deſtruction.</note> miſconſtrued the kings profitable counſell, as if his intent had beene to bereaue the French men of their oportunity, (beeing already raunged in battell,) and to aſſume the honour of the victory to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>To this effect he vttered many idle words; nor for that he was ſo perſwaded himſelfe, or could by any good reaſon diſſallow of the King of <hi>Hungaries</hi> counſell, but becauſe he enuyed the Lord <hi>Cowcyes</hi> late honourable exployt, and the reputation he had gained by defeating ſo great number of enemies with ſo ſmall forces. And he diſdained not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that himſelfe being both for dignity and reuenue one of the greateſt ſubiects i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

before him: preſuming that his opinion and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in ſuch caſes ought principally to take place, and to be reſpected aboue the reſt. Therefore reiecting the King of <hi>Hungaries</hi> aduiſe which the reſidue approoued, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing there was no delay to be made in the matter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expecting the ayde of his aſſociates, he marched for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward againſt the enemy. By occaſion whereof, the reſt were likewiſe enforced to ioyne their powers with his, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they would bee accounted betrayers of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>See what miſchiefe comes of pride and emulation. Now were their enemies vppon them, and the French men ſo beſette on all ſides with huge numbers which encompaſt them about, that they ſaw no way to eſcape. And although they were very few in compariſon of their enemies, yet in this diſtreſſe they ſhewed proofs of invincible corage: but they were ſo oppreſt with multitude, that it was impoſſible for them to auoyd a lamentable deſtruction. The Lords for <note place="margin">The ſiege be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Nicopolis</hi> raiſed, and all the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſlaine or taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> the moſt part were all taken priſoners, the beauty and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their armour diſcouering them to the Barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who ſaued their liues in hope to make great commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their ranſoms. After the victory, king <hi>Baſam</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a view of the dead bodyes to be taken, and when he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that there were many more ſlaine of his part, then of his enemies, being enraged with great fury, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded 300. gentlemen of diuers nations that remained priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſhould be all cruelly ſlaine, &amp; cut in peeces. The King of <hi>Hungary</hi> when he ſaw how the french men without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expectation, would raſhly aduenture againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, was exceedingly ſory: and when he beheld their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ouerthrowe, by perſwaſion of ſuch as were about him, not ſeeing any other remedy, he himſelfe alſo fled and paſſed ouer <hi>Danubius.</hi> Vndoubtedly the pride and enuy of the French men gaue the enemy that daies victory. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam</hi> the Turkiſh King, after he vnderſtood the eſtate of his priſoners, ſuch I meane as were of greater birth and calling
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:5967:102"/>
then the reſt, determined no violence againſt them, but ſent a meſſenger into <hi>Fraunce</hi> to giue notice of their capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity and the ouerthrowe of the Chriſtian army. <hi>Phillip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgoigne</hi> who tooke his ſonnes misfortune very heauily, perſwaded the French King, that he ſhould ſend ſome rich preſents to the barbarous tyrant, whereby he might be moued to deale more fauorably with his priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>Of all others the Lord <hi>Cowcyes</hi> noble ſpirit was moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected with this calamity: For entring into a deepe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration with himſelfe how hee had alwayes heeretofore beene very fortunate in warrelike affaires, and now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued ſo great a charge from a mighty prince, could not hold his place and execute his office for the enuy of his aduerſary, but was brought in danger of his life through another mans raſhneſſe in a barbarous countrey, with the loſſe and ſlaughter of a great number of his friendes, vppon the conceit heereof, he died for ſorrowe. To the like end alſo came the party, that by his folly and indiſcretion drew <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Cowcies</hi> death</note> ſo many thouſand people, and ſo many honourable perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages into deſtruction and extreame miſerie.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Burgoigne,</hi> to the intent to redeeme his <note place="margin">1397.</note> ſonne, and the reſt of his fellow priſoners from captiuitie, dealt with the Merchants of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi> (which trauell into all parts of the world for commodities) that ioyning with the other Ambaſſadors ſent by the French King, they ſhoulde compound with the Turkes for their ranſome. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which they made, was to this effect, that the Lords and Gentlemen that remayned priſoners, to the number of fiue and twenty, ſhould pay for their ranſome two hundred thouſand crownes: and for this ſumme the Merchants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſureties. From that time forth <hi>Baſam</hi> beganne to vſe the French men more curteouſly than he had done: and at their departure, taking occaſion to ſpeake to the Duke of <hi>Burgoignes</hi> ſonne, I perceiue (ſaide he) that thou arte deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended of high and noble parentage, &amp; liueſt in great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation

of honour: it can not be but a great griefe and oppreſſion to thy minde, thus in the flower of thy youth, to be ſubiected to this misfortune; for recouery of which diſgrace, and to put away the ſad remembraunce of this aduenture, perhappes thou wilt one day come in battell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me againe. And although by the lawe of armes I haue now power to binde both thee and thy fellowes from euer bearing armes againſt mee heereafter, yet will I not doe it, but freely giue leaue both to thee and the reſt, that being returned into your countries, yee ſhall aſſemble your vttermoſt forces, and make warres vpon me againe when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ye are diſpoſed. For I am of that courage and puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunce, and withall ſo confident in my fortunes, as I dread not the power of any enemy whatſoeuer: And this that I ſpeake, thou mayeſt boldely make report to whome thou thinkeſt good, in my name. Soone after, the French men being diſcharged, ſailed with the Venetians to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and departing from thence, after a long and trouble ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, at length arriued ſafely at <hi>Venice.</hi> During the time they ſoiourned there, the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> ſent a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to congratulate their deliuerance, ſignifying how much he reioyced at their happy enlargement: withall, how hee vnderſtoode they were to pay a great maſſe of money for their ranſome: and he heartily wiſhed his eſtate were ſuch, that he were able to ſupply their defect therof in ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull manner as he deſired. But as now by reaſon of the late vnfortunate ouerthrow, hee was much impoueriſhed, and the yearely reuenues of his Crowne not a little impayred. Neuertheleſſe, for ſome teſtimony of his good affection, whereas the State of <hi>Venice</hi> was to pay him yearely ſeauen thouſand crownes, hee had giuen commiſſion to his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to ſell that annuity, and the money riſing thereof to beſtow vpon them towards the furniſhing of their wants and maintenance of their neceſſary expences. The French men thankefully accepted this kindneſſe, but the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans anſwered ſubtilly and vncertainely to the matter; and

there were ſome that ſuſpected it was handled in ſuch ſort, of ſet purpoſe between them and the ambaſſadors of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.</hi>

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Burgoigne</hi> obtayning a friendly beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his people, not without helpe of the French kings liberalitie, diſcharged his credite with the Merchants. His ſonne being returned into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> made a large rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the king of ſuch things as he had obſerued through the whole courſe of his voyage: in concluſion adding thus much, how it was not vnknowne to the <hi>Turkes,</hi> that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the ciuill diſſention of the Popes, the generall quiet, not onely of the Church, but alſo of all Chriſtendome, was diſturbed; and that it ſeemed a wonder to them, how euer Kings and Princes could ſuffer ſuch licentious libertie and vnbridled ambition of one or two perſons to remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled. The kings mind was exceedingly moued with this diſcourſe, ſo as from that time forward he intended to the eſtabliſhing of peace more earneſtly than euer before.</p>

And knowing himſelfe to be in great fauour and authority with the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners, hee perſwaded them that from thencefoorth they ſhould refuſe the payment of the taxe which was impoſed vppon all kindes of merchandiſe certaine yeares ſince, for maintenaunce of the warres, and defence of the Countrey, ſeeing now all was quiet againe; and a truce taken with the enemy: for ſuch kinde of exactions hee ſaide were vniuſt, and contrary to reaſon.

this matter to the King, who referred his anſwer till the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which being come, the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> made publike declaration of the Kings minde, in ſuch ſort as they were all well pacified for that time, and departed without further trouble. Not long after, the earle of Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſent from the French king to viſite the new <note place="margin">The Earle of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>

After his departure, a generall brute was raiſed, that the king would reſtore <hi>Calice</hi> to the French men, and that hee had already concluded vpon the matter with the earle, whome the French king had ſent Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour for the ſame purpoſe.

Theſe falſe reportes and malitious ſuggeſtions greatly troubled the kings mind, and when hee vnderſtoode that his vncle aſpired to the Crowne, and ſtudied how to bring his purpoſe to effect, not without bewayling the preſent ſtate of his countrey, he asked counſell of the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and ſome others, (whoſe diſpoſitions hee miſtruſted not) what courſe they would aduiſe him to in this behalfe. The Duke and the reſt as well as they could, endeuoured to quiet his thoughts, and to remooue all feare and ſuſpition out of his minde, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him, that their loue and good affection ſhould neuer faile to doe him faithfull ſeruice. But in the end, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proceeded ſo farre, that ſuch as were moſt familiar with the King, and neareſt about him, being vnable to brooke the pride and ouerdaring inſolencie of the Duke of <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>

(for he hated all thoſe whom the King fauoured) prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted plainely, that in regarde of his ſeditious practiſes, they could no longer continue their places without great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their liues, and hazard of their eſtates. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon diuerſe were ſeene, and thoſe of the chiefer ſort, to abandon the Court, and retire themſelues to their country dwellings: for it was no hard matter to foreſee to what iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue all things tended. To be ſhort, the King moued with with theſe ſpeeches concurring with ſo manifeſt preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, after much deliberation, vnder a politicke pretence of great kindneſſe, allured his vncle from his owne houſe to ride abroade with him a hunting. Who being by this meanes trayned foorth with a ſmall company, was by the Earle Marſhall ſodainely arreſted in the Kings name, and conueyed in great ſecrecie to the Caſtle of <hi>Calice.</hi> When hee had remained there a while, much miſtruſting what ſhould become of him, one day as hee was entred into the great chamber, and about to waſh his handes before din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, foure luſty fellowes, appoynted by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, caſt a towell about his necke, and winding it ſtrongly a croſſe two at the one end, and two at the other, ouerthrew him to the ground, and ſtrangled him. Then ſtripping off his clothes, and cloſing his eyes, they layd him <note place="margin">The duke of <hi>Glow eſter</hi> murdered in the caſtle of <hi>Calice.</hi> 1397.</note> in his bed, and preſently gaue it foorth in the Caſtle, how the Duke that night died ſodainely of an apoplexy. Within two dayes after, his death was publiſhed: but there were few or none, either in <hi>Fraunce</hi> or <hi>England</hi> that greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed him. For ſuch was his deſert, as he had long ſince purchaſed euery mans ill affection, by reaſon of his turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirite, which was altogether bent to mooue vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and contention.

               <p>After the Lordes of <hi>Fraunce</hi> were raunſomed from the Turkes and returned into their countrey, the French King much mooued with the Earle of <hi>Neuers</hi> diſcourſe, to the <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Burgoignes</hi> ſonne.</note> intent to eſtabliſh concord in the Church, addreſſed Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters foorthwith to the Emperour, earneſtly requeſting his aſſiſtaunce in that behalfe. By mutuall conſent a day was appoynted for their meeting at <hi>Rhemes.</hi> Other matters were deuiſed and giuen forth for the occaſion of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither, that the true cauſe of that aſſembly, which they were deſirous to conceale, might for a time be kept ſecret. After a ſolemne enterview and great conſultation, it was agreed, that the Biſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi> ſhould be direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> then lying at <hi>Rome</hi> to exhort him, that for the generall quiet and welfare of the Church, he would be content to reſigne his office, not for euer, but onely till ſuch time as by the determination of Princes and learned Diuines, a reſolution of all controuerſies might be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. The Pope anſwered gently, that he would take the aduiſe of his Cardinalles. But the people of <hi>Rome</hi> in the meane while hauing learned the cauſe of the Ambaſſadors comming, and perceiuing it would turne greatly to their diſcommoditie, perſwaded the Pope that hee ſhould not for any reſpect of Kings or Princes whoſoeuer, abaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:5967:105"/>
ſo much, but rather ſtand in defence of his right to the vttermoſt. The Pope therefore diſſembling his purpoſe, at his next communication with the Ambaſſadour, told him, that for his part he would not refuſe to accompliſh the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and the Kings requeſt, ſo as his aduerſary would be content to doe the like. Being diſmiſſed with this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, the Ambaſſadour returned to the Emperour, whom he found at <hi>Confluence,</hi> and when he had deliuered his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, departed from thence into <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Diuines there were of opinion, that the like motion ſhould be made to <hi>Benedict,</hi> as had bin before to <hi>Boniface.</hi> And vpon this determination the ſame Biſhop beeing ſent by the King to <hi>Avinion,</hi> declared the mindes and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Princes to the Pope. Who aunſwered plainely and peremptorily, that hee would condiſcend to no ſuch matter. Notwithſtanding when he had propounded it to his Cardinalles, they were of ſundry opinions, according as they were mooued by their ſeuerall diſpoſitions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. And when no certaintic could be concluded, by reaſon of the difference amongeſt them, their aſſembly brake vp. Then the Ambaſſadour preſſing into the Popes preſence, required his reſolution. The Pope prowdly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, how he was lawfully and orderly promoted to that holy dignity, which hee would in no wiſe forgoe as long as he liued, neyther was any man liuing ſo deere vnto him for whoſe pleaſure hee would departe from his right, and much leſſe did he feare any force or violence in that behalf. The Ambaſſador ſeeing no other anſwere could be gotten, returned homewardes, and by the way ſhewed the ſucceſſe of his affaires to the Marſhall of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> whome the king had ſent with an army to ſecond his proceedings. The Marſhall as ſoone as hee vnderſtoode the Popes obſtinate reſolution, made haſte to <hi>Avinion,</hi> and forraged all the country about, diuiding his forces into diuerſe companies, to keepe all conueiance of victuall from the towne. He him ſelfe encamped before the Citty, threatning the inhabitants
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:5967:106"/>
to deſtroy all their houſes, and their vineyardes which they had abroad in the countrey, vnleſſe they yeelded. The towneſmen well conſidering there was little helpe in the Pope, and that the King was of great puiſſaunce, tooke counſell with certaine French Cardinalles, and by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe ſet open their gates. The Pope ſuffered himſelfe to <note place="margin">Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> beſieged, and taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the Frenchmen.</note> be beſieged in his pallace, hoping to haue beene reſcued by his couſine the King of <hi>Arragon:</hi> but the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> was too wiſe to incurre the offence of ſo mighty a Prince for the Popes pleaſure, from whom he could expect ſmall ſuccour againe if occaſion ſhould ſerue heereafter. Many of his Cardinalles exhorted him to a milder kinde of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but the Pope full of pride and arrogancie ſtoode firme in his firſt reſolution, ſeeming as it were ſecure of his eſtate, and altogether careleſſe what ſhould become of him. Hee was plentifully furniſhed of all neceſſaries, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing onely fewell, the want whereof, together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant importunity of the Cardinalles, compelled him at length to yeelde vp the place. The Marſhall bound him by othe, that hee ſhould not departe out of the Citty before ſuch time as an vnion were eſtabliſhed in the Church, and to be ſure he ſhould not falſifie his promiſe, appoynted a ſufficient guarde to attend him, and cauſed the Cardinalles and rich Cittizens of <hi>Avinion</hi> to become ſureties for his foorth-comming. The French King hauing written the whole diſcourſe of theſe proceedings to the Emperour, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the King of <hi>England,</hi> that following their example, he ſhould likewiſe take parte with neyther of the Popes, but ſtand indifferent for a time, till ſome remedy might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided. The King was very willing to haue ſatisfied his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in lawes requeſt. But when the matter was propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in parliament, hee not onely effected nothing of his deſire, but more and more vehemently incenſed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt him, whome it exceedingly offended, that he ſhould be ſo addicted to the French men, that to doe them a pleaſure, it ſeemed hee would haue condiſcended to anie

And they told him, that howſoeuer they had beene otherwiſe well contented to ſet aſide all partialitie of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, either to the one partie, or the other, yet in regarde the French King ſo earneſtly deſired it, they would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to his requeſt, nor in any wiſe allow that hee ſhoulde preſcribe articles of religion in <hi>England.</hi>

And not content heerewith, he diſtributed many of the Duke of <hi>Lancaſters</hi> goodes among ſuch perſons as no man loued, but himſelfe. The Earle of <hi>Derby</hi> was highly fauoured and reſpected by the French King, in regarde of his noble carriage and generous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. And becauſe hee was alſo a man of great poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there was a match motioned betweene him and the Duke of <hi>Berries</hi> daughter which was then a widow. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as ſoone as the King of <hi>England</hi> had intelligence, he ſent an Ambaſſador foorthwith to interrupt their proceedings; informing his father in law and his vncles, that hee with whome they intended to contract affinitie, was a wicked perſon and a traitour. The Earle from whome all this was kept ſecret, to the intent to learne what the Ambaſſadour had doone (for he miſtruſted ſomewhat becauſe he had not ſeene him all the time of his being there) fell in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation againe with the French King and his brothers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the marriage. And they not thinking good to hold him longer in ſuſpence, declared what reporte they hadde heard of him from the King of <hi>England.</hi> How much the Earle was grieued and diſcontented heerewithall, any man out of his owne iudgement may eaſily coniecture.

were exceedingly diſpleaſed at this his vnworthy and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious accuſation, for they knew aſſuredly it proceeded of mere malice &amp; hatred. King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſame time made preparation for another voyage into <hi>Ireland,</hi> aſſembling to the number of tenne thouſand archers, and two thouſand horſemen: and hee baniſhed twoonoble men of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <note place="margin">

To be ſhort, many cauſes concurred together at one time to aggrauate the peoples hatred againſt the King. By occaſion whereof, certaine ill diſpoſed perſons taking aduantage of the time, when they ſaw the king both buſied in warre, and irrecouerably depriued of the loue of his ſubiects, aſſembling together in rowts and companies, made ſpoyle of the husbandmen, robbed the Merchants, and ranged ouer all the countrey, doing great violence and miſchiefe, inſomuch that many to auoyde the daunger of their outrage, were forced to conuey themſelues into <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and other places of ſecuritie.</p>
               <p>When the king had thus vtterly loſt the harts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundell.</note> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by generall conſent of the State, was addreſſed to the Erle of <hi>Derby,</hi> to bring him againe into <hi>England,</hi> vpon moſt aſſured hope and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Crowne.

At which tidings the Cittizens ſodainely ſurpriſed with ioy; came flocking out of the gates in great companies to welcome the Earle; from thencefoorth couenaunting to receiue him for King of <hi>England.</hi> Soone after, a certaine number well appointed were ſent foorth againſt king <hi>Richard,</hi> to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him and bring him to <hi>London.</hi> Many of the Kings fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers when they vnderſtood of the <hi>Londoners</hi> comming, ſoone changed their ſeruice, and choſe them new Maſters.

As they carried him towardes <hi>London,</hi> he requeſted one thing very earneſtly, which was, that hee might not be led through the Citty. His requeſt was graunted, but the people much offended. As ſoone as he came thither, he was conueyed to priſon. New offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and ſeruants were placed about the Queene, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ladies and Gentlewomen appointed to attend her, all the French being diſmiſſed, and ſent home into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.

And ſhortly after hee cauſed to be beheaded foure of the chiefe that had bin about King <hi>Richard,</hi> by whoſe counſell hee confeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to haue been principally ruled in thoſe matters which were obiected againſt him. They were drawne to their execution vnder the proſpect of his windowe, of purpoſe that he might ſee them. The Lords that accompanied him in priſon bewailed their miſerable eſtates, and the King himſelfe with the conſideration of his heauie misfortune, burſt foorth into aboundaunce of teares, and with bitter ſighes curſed the day and houre that euer hee was borne, to come to ſuch an end as now entred into his cogitation. He was perſwaded by his partners in miſery, that to appeaſe his aduerſary, and to purchaſe the aſſuraunce of his owne ſafety, and ſuch as were about him, hee ſhould renounce his royall ſtate and dignity. Herevpon he required to haue communication with the Earle, to whome when hee had declared his mind, after the acceptance of his offer, the Erle fell into a bitter reproofe of his former life, making a large repetition of his offences, and beſides, vpbrayded him with baſtardy: for many reported that he was begotten by a Prieſt.
