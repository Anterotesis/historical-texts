            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter so many <hi>Favors,</hi> and those so great, Conferr'd on me by Your Lordship these many yeares; which, I may call more properly one Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Act of Your <hi>Generosity</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; I know not whether I should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear either more Ungrateful in my Silence, or more Extravagantly Vaine in my endeavours to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:48641:3"/>
them. For, since all Acknowledgments bear a Face of Payment, it may be thought, That I have flatter'd my self into an Opinion of being able to return some part of my Obligements to You; the just despair of which Attempt, and the due Veneration I have for his Person, to whom I must Address, have almost driven me, to Receive only with a profound Submission the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of that Vertue, which is never to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended but by Admiration: And the greatest note of Admiration is Silence. 'Tis that noble Passion, to which <hi>Poets</hi> raise their Audience in highest Subjects, and they have then gain'd over them the greatest Victory, when they are Ravish'd into a Pleasure, which is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd by Words. To this Pitch, <hi>My Lord,</hi> the sence of my Gratitude had almost rais'd me: to receive your <hi>Favors</hi> as the <hi>Iewes</hi> of old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd their <hi>Law,</hi> with a mute Wonder, to think, that the Loudness of Acclamation, was onely the Praise of Men to Men, and that the secret homage of the Soul was a greater Mark of Reverence, than an outward ceremonious joy, which might be counterfeit, and must be irreverent in its Tumult. Neither, <hi>My Lord,</hi> have I a particular right to pay you my Acknowledgments: You have been a Good so Universal, that almost every Man in three Nations may think me Injurious to his Propriety, that I invade your Praises, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
<pb facs="tcp:48641:3"/>
to celebrate them alone. And, that have assum'd to my self a Patron, who was no more to be circumscrib'd than the Sun and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are of Publick benefit to humane kind.</p>
            <p>As it was in much your power to oblige all who could pretend to Merit from the Publick, so it was more in your Nature and Inclination. If any went ill-satisfy'd from the Treasury, while, it was in your Lordships Management, it proclaim'd the want of Desert, and not of Friends: You Distributed your Masters Favour with so equal hands, that <hi>Iustice</hi> her self could not have held the Scales more even: but, with that Natural Propensity to do good, that had that Treasure been your own, your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to Bounty must have ruin'd you: No Man attended to be deny'd: no Man brib'd for Expedition: want, and desert were pleas sufficient. By your own Integrity and your Prudent Choice of those whom you employ'd, the King gave all that He intended, and Gratuities to His Officers made not vain His Bounty. This, <hi>My Lord,</hi> you were in your Publick capacity of High-Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, to which you ascended by such degrees, that your Royal Master saw your Vertues still growing to His Favours faster than they could rise to you. Both at home, and abroad, with your Sword and with your Counsel, you have serv'd Him with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byass'd Honor, and with unshaken resolution:
<pb facs="tcp:48641:4"/>
making His Greatness, and the true Interest of your Country, the standard and measure of your actions Fortune may desert the wise and brave; but, true Vertue never will forsake it self. 'Tis the Interest of the World that Vertuous Men should attain to Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, because it gives them the power of doing good. But, when by the Iniquity of the Times they are brought to that extremity, that they must either quit their Vertue or their Fortune, they owe themselves so much, as to retire to the private exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their Honour; to be great within, and by the constancy of their Resolutions, to teach the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior World, how they ought to judge of such Principles, which are asserted with so generous and so unconstrain'd a Tryal.</p>
            <p>But, this voluntary neglect of Honours, has been of rare Example in the World: few Men have frown'd first upon Fortune, and precipitated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the top of her Wheele, before they felt at least the Declination of it. We read not of many Emperors like <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who have preferr'd a Garden, and a Cloyster, before a Crowd of Followers, and the troublesome Glory of an Active Life, which robs the Possessor of his rest and quiet, to secure the safety and happiness of others. <hi>Seneca,</hi> with the help of his <hi>Philosophy,</hi> could never attain to that pitch of Vertue. He onely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to prevent his fall by descending first; and, offer'd to resign that Wealth which he knew he
<pb facs="tcp:48641:4"/>
could no longer hold. He would onely have made a Present to his Master of what he foresaw would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Prey: He strove to avoid the Jealousie of a Tyrant; You dismiss'd your self from the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Privacy of a Gracious King. Our Age has afforded us many Examples of a contrary nature: but your Lordship is the onely one of this. 'Tis easie to discover in all Governments those who waite so close on Fortune, that they are never to be shaken off at any turne: Such who seem to have taken up a resolution of being Great, to continue their Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Theater of Business: to change with the Scene, and shift the Vizard for another part. These Men condemn in their Discourses that Vertue which they dare not practice. But the sober part of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age, and impartial Posterity will do right, both to your Lordship and to them. And when they read on what Accounts, and with how much Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity you quitted those Honours, to which the highest Ambition of an <hi>English</hi> Subject could aspire, will apply to you with much more reason, what the Historian said of a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour; <hi>Multi diuti<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To this Retirement of your Lordship, I wish I could bring a better Entertainment, than this <hi>Play</hi>; which, though it succeeded on the Stage, will scarcely bear a serious perusal, it being contriv'd and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a Moneth, the Subject barren, the Persons low, and the Writing not heightned with many laboured
<pb facs="tcp:48641:5"/>
Scenes. The consideration of these defects ought to have prescrib'd more modesty to the Author, than to have presented it to that person in the World, for whom he has the greatest Honor, and of whose Patronage, the best of his Endeavours had been unworthy. But, I had not satisfied my self in stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing longer, and could never have paid the Debt with a much better Play. As it is, the meaness of it will shew at least, that I pretend not by it to make any manner of return for your Favours; and, that I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give you a new Occasion of Exercising your Goodness to me, in pardoning the Failings and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of, <hi>My Lord,</hi>

            <l>AS needy Gallants in the Scriv'ners hands,</l>
            <l>Court the rich Knave that gripes their Mortgag'd Lands,</l>
            <l>The first fat Buck of all the Season's sent</l>
            <l>And Keeper takes no Fee in Complement:</l>
            <l>The doteage of some <hi>Englishmen</hi> is such</l>
            <l>To fawn on those who ruine them; the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They shall have all rather then make a War</l>
            <l>With those who of the same Religion are.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Streights,</hi> the <hi>Guiney</hi> Trade, the Herrings too,</l>
            <l>Nay, to keep friendship, they shall pickle you:</l>
            <l>Some are resolv'd not to find out the Cheat,</l>
            <l>But Cuckold like, loves him who does the Feat:</l>
            <l>What injuries soe'r upon us fall,</l>
            <l>Yet still the same Religion answers all:</l>
            <l>Religion wheedled you to Civil War,</l>
            <l>Drew <hi>English</hi> Blood, and <hi>Dutchmens</hi> now wou'd spare:</l>
            <l>Be gull'd no longer, for you'l find it true,</l>

            <l>Well Monarchys may own Religions name,</l>
            <l>But States are Atheists in their very frame.</l>
            <l>They share a sin, and such proportions fall</l>

                     <p>Then my brave Governor, if you're a true Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I'le make your fat sides heave with the conceit on't, till you're blown like a pair of large Smiths Bellows, here look upon this Paper.</p>
                     <p>Harman <hi>reading. You may remember we did endamage the</hi> English East-India <hi>Company, the value of Five hundred thousand pounds, all in one year; a Treaty is now Sign'd, in which the business is tane up for fourscore thousand.</hi> This is news indeed; wou'd I were upon the <hi>Castle Wall,</hi> that I might throw my Cap into the Sea, and my Gold Chain after it, this is golden news, boys.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Van Her.</speaker>
                     <p>This is news wou'd kindle a thousand Bonfires, and make us piss 'em out again in Rhenish Wine.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harm.</speaker>
                     <p>Send presently to all our Factories, acquaint them with these blessed tidings: if we can scape to cheap, 'twill be no matter what villanies henceforth we put in practice.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fisc.</speaker>
                     <p>Hum, why this now gives encouragement to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Plot, which I have long been brewing, against these <hi>Skellum English.</hi> I almost have it here in Pericranio, and 'tis a sound one faith, no less, then to cut all their Throats, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48641:8"/>
seize all their Effects within this Island. I warrant you we may compound again.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Van Her.</speaker>
                     <p>Seizing their Factories, I like well enough, it has some Savour in't, but for this whorson cutting of Throats, it goes a little against the grain, because tis so Notoriously known in Christendom, that they have preserv'd ours from being cut by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>Hang 'em base <hi>English</hi> sterts, let 'em e'en take their part of their own old Proverb, save a Thief from the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; they wou'd needs protect us Rebels, and see what comes to themselves.</p>

                     <speaker>Fisc.</speaker>
                     <p>You're ith' right on't Noble <hi>Harman,</hi> their assistance, which was a Mercy, and a Providence to us, shall be a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them.</p>

                     <speaker>Van Her.</speaker>
                     <p>A little favor wou'd do well; though, not that I wou'd stop the Current of your Wit, or any other Plot to do them mischief, but they were first discoverers of this Isle, first Traded hither, and show'd us the way.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fisc.</speaker>
                     <p>I grant you that, nay more, that by composition made after many long and tedious quarrels, they were to have a third part of the Traffick, we to build Forts, and they to contribute to the charge.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harm.</speaker>
                     <p>Which we have so increas'd each year upon 'em, we being in power, and therefore Judges of the Cost, that we exact what e're we please, still more then half the charge, and on pretence of their Non-payment, or the least delay, do often stop their Ships, detain their Goods, and drag 'em into Prisons, while our Commodities go on before, and still forestall their Markets.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fisc.</speaker>
                     <p>These I confess are pretty tricks, but will not do our business, we must our selves be ruin'd at long run, if they have any Trade here; I know our charge at length will eat us out; I wou'd not let these <hi>English</hi> from this Isle, have Cloves enough to stick an Orange with, not one to throw into their bottle-Ale.</p>

                     <speaker>Harm.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fisc.</speaker>
                     <p>Let me alone a while, I have it as I told you here;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48641:9"/>
mean time we must put on a feeming kindness, call 'em our Benefactors, and dear Brethren, pipe 'em within the danger of our Net, and then we'l draw it o're 'em: when they're in, no mercy, that's my maxime.</p>

                     <speaker>Van Her.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, Brother, I am not too obstinate for saving <hi>English</hi>-men; 'twas but a qualme of conscience which profit will dispel: I have as true a <hi>Dutch</hi> Antipathy to <hi>England,</hi> as the proudest He in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> that's a bold word now.</p>

                     <speaker>Harm.</speaker>
                     <p>We are secure of our Superiors there; well, they may give the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> a Verbal satisfaction, and with submissive fawning promises, make show to punish us, but interest is their God as well as ours: to that Almighty, they will sacrifice a thousand <hi>English</hi> Lives, and break a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Oaths, e're they will punish those that make 'em rich, and pull their Rivals down.

Were I to chuse of all mankind, a Man, on whom I would relie for Faith and Counsel, or more, whose personal aid I wou'd invite, in any worthy cause to second me, it shou'd be only <hi>Gabriel Towerson</hi>; daring he is, and there to fortunate: yet soft and apt to pitty the distress'd, and liberal to relieve 'em: I have seen him not alone to pardon Foes, but by his bounty win 'em to his love: if he has any fault, 'tis only that, to which great minds can only subject be, he thinks all honest, 'cause himself is so, and therefore none suspects.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> Poet once the <hi>Spartan</hi>'s led to fight,</l>
            <l>And made 'em Conquer in the Muses right:</l>
            <l>So wou'd our Poet lead you on this day:</l>
            <l>Showing your tortur'd Fathers in his Play.</l>
            <l>To one well born, th' affront is worse and more,</l>
            <l>When he's abus'd, and baffled by a Bore:</l>
            <l>With an ill Grace the <hi>Dutch</hi> their mischiefs do,</l>
            <l>They've both ill Nature and ill Manners too.</l>
            <l>Well may they boast themselves an antient Nation,</l>
            <l>For they were bred e're Manners, were in fashion:</l>
            <l>And their new Common wealth has set 'em free,</l>
            <l>Onely from Honour and Civility.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Venetians</hi> do not more uncouthly ride,</l>
            <l>Than did their Lubber-State Mankind bestride.</l>
            <l>Their sway became 'em with as ill a Meen,</l>
            <l>As their own Paunches swell above their Chin:</l>
            <l>Yet is their Empire no true Growth but Humour,</l>
            <l>And onely two King's Touch can cure the Tumor.</l>
            <l>As <hi>Cato</hi> did his <hi>Affricque</hi> Fruits display:</l>
            <l>So we before your Eies their <hi>Indies</hi> lay:</l>
            <l>All Loyal <hi>English</hi> will like him conclude,</l>
            <l>Let <hi>Caesar</hi> Live, and <hi>Carthage</hi> be subdu'd.</l>
