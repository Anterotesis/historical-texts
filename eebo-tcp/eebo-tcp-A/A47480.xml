            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ELEGY
On the Death of that moſt Laborious and Painful Miniſter of the Goſpel
Mr. JOHN NORCOT,
Who fell aſleep in the Lord the 24th of this inſtant March 1675/6.</head>
            <l>HOw doth my troubled Soul amuſed ſtand,</l>
            <l>On thoughts of God's moſt ſore Chaſtiſing hand;</l>
            <l>Let Heaven aſſiſt my Pen, and help indite</l>
            <l>This Mournful Elegy I'm mov'd to write.</l>
            <l>My grieved heart knows not what way to take,</l>
            <l>Its love to ſhew and lamentation make.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Jonathan</hi> was ſore diſtreſt,</l>
            <l>And in like ſort has ſorrow ſeiz'd my Breſt.</l>
            <l>Beloved <hi>John</hi> is gone, dear <hi>Norcot</hi>'s dead;</l>
            <l>That <hi>Man of God,</hi> who hath ſo often fed</l>
            <l>Our precious Souls with Manna from above:</l>
            <l>Whoſe powerful preaching did ingage our love</l>
            <l>To <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> O! he had care and skill</l>
            <l>To feed poor ſouls and do his Maſter's will.</l>
            <l>But is he from us alſo took away,</l>
            <l>What, breach ſtill upon breach! Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſtay</l>
            <l>Thy hand, ſuch ſtrokes are hardly born,</l>
            <l>Here's cauſe for hundreds to lament and mourn.</l>
            <l>The loſs is great the Churches do ſuſtain,</l>
            <l>Poor ſinners too like cauſe have to complain.</l>
            <l>There's few like him ſurviving to arouſe</l>
            <l>Their ſluggiſh ſouls out of their ſinful drouſe.</l>
            <l>They now may ſleep ſecure and not awake.</l>
            <l>Until they fall into the <hi>Stygian Lake.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>This Golden Trumpet's ſtopt, 'twill ſound no more,</l>
            <l>To warn them of what danger's at their door.</l>
            <l>To win ſinners to Chriſt he did not ſpare</l>
            <l>His ſtrength nor time, thought nothing was too dear</l>
            <l>To part with all, if any ways he might,</l>
            <l>Their Souls turn from falſe ways unto the right:</l>
            <l>Like as a Candle which much light doth give,</l>
            <l>Doth waſte it ſelf, whilſt from it we receive</l>
            <l>Much benefit; ſo did he clearly burn,</l>
            <l>To the waſting of himſelf unto the urn.</l>
            <l>This godly Preacher in a little ſpace,</l>
            <l>Much work did do, he ſwiftly run his race;</l>
            <l>With's might perform'd what e'r he found to do.</l>
            <l>God graciouſly did bleſs his work alſo,</l>
            <l>Yea few (I think) have had the like ſucceſs,</l>
            <l>In turning ſinners unto righteouſneſs.</l>
            <l>O were the worth of this good man but known,</l>
            <l>It might produce an univerſal groan.</l>
            <l>Let Brethren dear of different minds lament,</l>
            <l>For he for you in prayers much time has ſpent;</l>
            <l>He lov'd you all, though I have cauſe to fear,</l>
            <l>The like affection ſome did ſcarcely bear.</l>
            <l>'Twould pierce ones heart to think in ſuch a time,</l>
            <l>Obedience unto Chriſt ſhould be a crime;</l>
            <l>Or that offence ſhould in the leaſt be took,</l>
            <l>'Cauſe from Gods word he durſt not turn nor look.</l>
            <l>He would own naught but what <hi>thus ſaith the Lord,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Add would not he nor miniſh from Gods Word.</l>
            <l>Come let us live in love, we <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

            <l>Let ſinners mourn, who ſhall their loſs repair,</l>
            <l>Who for their Souls ſo naturally did care.</l>
            <l>Well may ye fear God will proclaim new wars,</l>
            <l>When he calls home his choice Embaſſadors.</l>
            <l>What may a <hi>Sodome</hi> look for from above,</l>

            <l>O tremble City, what is God about,</l>
            <l>Look for new flames, thy <hi>Lots</hi> are calling out.</l>
            <l>And now chaſtized flock a word or two,</l>
            <l>I've double ſorrow when I think of you.</l>
            <l>When that the Harveſt doth for Reapers call,</l>
            <l>To loſe your Labourer, this wound's not ſmall.</l>
            <l>O who ſhall bear the burthen of the day,</l>
            <l>If God doth take the Labourers thus away.</l>
            <l>When Pylots die, how ſhall the Seaman ſtear,</l>
            <l>'Mong'ſt Rocks and Sands, when ſtormes alſo appear.</l>
            <l>Have we not cauſe to think the crafty Fox,</l>

            <l>And Ravening Wolves alſo will grow more bold.</l>
            <l>And ſcare ſome ſilly Lambs out of the fold;</l>
            <l>If God proceed to call the Shepherds home,</l>
            <l>O what will of ſo many flocks become.</l>
            <l>'Ith' midſt of all, in this doth comfort lie,</l>
            <l>The chiefeſt Shepherd lives when others die.</l>
            <l>And he be ſure who for the Sheep did bleed,</l>
            <l>Will ſtick to them in times of greateſt need.</l>
            <l>Come ceaſe your grief, don't you know very well,</l>
            <l>The care God has of his own <hi>Iſraell.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And its no more which now is come to paſs,</l>
            <l>Then what by you ſome time expected was,</l>
            <l>And what is done is but our Fathers will,</l>
            <l>Therefore be ſilent, every one be ſtill:</l>
            <l>For ſhould we yield to paſſion I have fears,</l>
            <l>We ſhould grieve Chriſt and wound our Souls with tears.</l>
            <l>The narrow Sluces too of dribling eyes,</l>
            <l>Would be too ſtreight for thoſe great Springs that riſe.</l>
            <l>But ſince our Veſſels fills up to the top,</l>
            <l>Lets empty them, for every ſin a drop.</l>
            <l>For it lets wiſh we were compos'd of Snow,</l>
            <l>Inſtead of Fleſh, yea made of Ice, that ſo</l>
            <l>We might in ſenſe of ſin and it loathing,</l>
            <l>Melt with hot love to Chriſt, yea thaw to nothing.</l>
            <l>And ſhould our ſins deprive our Souls of him,</l>
            <l>Let tears run from our Eyes till Couches ſwim.</l>
            <l>Yet let's not grudge him that moſt happy bliſs,</l>
            <l>Who now in glory with Chriſt Jeſus is.</l>
