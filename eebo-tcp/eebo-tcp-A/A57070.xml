            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Commonality of a Kingdom thongh a great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, hath a quick ſence, Tyranny and oppreſſions preſently felt, private aymes and ſelf ambitions eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned; whence true <hi>Patriotts,</hi> whoſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſquare only with their truſts, redeeming generall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and improving publique intereſt, cannot looſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Plaudit. And we no inconſiderable part of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms Commonallty (our vocation, as to uſe, reflected on) in our ſence of your late renownfull reſolutions overcoming all obſtructions and difficulties) to ſettle the Nation in a bleſſed poſture of liberty and ſafety, humbly commenſurate with the bleſſing: preſent this acknowledgement of our great thankfulneſſe; And whereas rumour not able to belye their deſperate and implacable malice: loudly ſpeaketh the common enemy, buſie in ſoliciting and inciting <hi>forreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and States to an Invaſion, We with much joy reſent your vigilance and timely circumſpection for their repulſion and our defence, and more eſpecially in your preſent preparation of a numerous and well appointed Fleet; whereunto moved by common piety and duty of devotion, we became thus bold to obtrude zeale, and in this glorious cauſe of reſtored freedom, againſt all malignant oppoſers, make this hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of our lives and ſervices.</p>
            <p>And becauſe they but vainly pretend perfect health, who only fortifie againſt the evills without, and not expell the pecant humours within, We with a better providence, but confining it to our own ſpheare, humbly deſire that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous practices and abuſes (of long time, and yet) acted and ſuffered in and about the Navy, to the infinite diſhonour and prejudice of the whole Nation, may in this happy jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Reformation ſpeedily be taken into conſideration and redreſſe.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:104758:4"/>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt the improper and dangerous mode and Cuſtome in electing all ſorts of Officers, but more eſpecially of Captains and chief Commanders of Ships and Pinaces in former times, by Court favour and paraſitiſme, and under pretence of eſtate (and indeed more frequently pretended then reall) whence iſſued much diſſervice to the State in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and no publique pay ſtated (excepting meerely allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the table, many ſubſequent cheates too many here) but upon further diſcuſſe and oportunity (to be enumerated in theſe latter times, by corrupt or indirect meanes, as bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and inſinuating into the Secretaries Clarkes, and the like Miniſters of Committees, whence diſaffected perſons that would ſubmit to ſuch diſhoneſt contracts accepted, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected that would not, excluded, have ſucceeded many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults in our Seas, and that the laſt years ſo foule defection and perrilous Revolt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That all, or moſt places and Offices, in, or belonging to the Navy, are by ancient Cuſtom tenanted, as it were, and to be poſſeſt for life, whereby much ſupinenes, neglect, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice hath, and cannot but accrew, for then a conſciouſneſs of being ſtrictly obſerved, and if faulty, diſplaſt; a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table both reigne to diſſoluteneſſe and ſpur to duty cannot be.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The great want of time, and conſequently detriment to ſervice, occaſioned by the preſent Cuſtom in victualling the Navy, every Ship defaulking ſix weeks of the ſix months, ſhe is bound forth, and not ſeldom lying, as many more wind-bound.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The moſt injurious, and no leſſe pernitious ingroſing, committed by the former Committees and Commiſſioners of the Navy, of all the imployment at Sea, and impropriating it to their own ſhipping; for thereby at farre greater rates then otherwiſe would have been, hath the State been long ſerved with Ships leſſe ſerviceable, and undoubtedly, the will and power of the owners (to bear all out reflicted on) unexpoſeable to any hardſhip of fight and weather.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104758:4"/>
            <p n="5">5.

            <p>And foraſmuch as we conceive, it is no leſſe eminently our duties, then our obſervations of defaults and grievances, to repreſent our judgements for their redreſſes, we humbly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne as followeth.</p>

            <p>That the Commanders of Ships and Pinnaces, be from henceforth made choice of, rather then a vaine pretence of eſtate (Bribery, Paraſitiſme, or Lordly favour) by their abilities in <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Sea ſervice,</hi> in caſe they be, as only then apt, for ſo great Truſt, of Religious life, and honeſt converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereby will enſue a greater compliance and love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the commanded Sea-Men; and more ſervice done in one yeare, then before this Parliament in one and twenty.</p>
            <p>And in regard alſo that many enormities have been, and will be probably continued, without a timely and powerfull ſuppreſſion in the <hi>Trinity Houſe,</hi> and all Officers thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing. We humbly move, that a free and uninterrupted liberty be granted (and a Declaration, if needfull, to ſignifie the ſame to all manner of perſons to come and exhibite their Complaints, and without any long tireſome attendance (cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin German to injuſtice) have a day certaine given them for producing their Atteſtations, And that all ſuch impartially, and without reſpect of perſons) as ſhall be found guilty of indirect and fraudulent practiſes, as ſelling of places, extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fees, Bribery, or any other Miſdemeanours, in their reſpective Offices and Charges, May be with open diſgrace (as a happy caution to them that ſhall ſucceed them) forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with diſmiſt of their reſpective places, and be ordered to make due compenſation for the wrongs and dammages which in any kind have been ſuſtained by them.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:104758:5"/>
            <p>And that the Committee now conſtituted, may take order and provide, that no Secretaries Clarke, or any other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter whatſoever, officiating in the ſaid Trinity houſe, or to the Committee, or Commiſſions of the Navy, be permitted to hold or execute any place, or charge, that hath in any ſort been an abettor to the ſaid Revolt, or ſhall be lawfully proved guilty of apparant malignancy.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p>And whereas the Grandees of Trinity houſe, gave ſo cleare a diſplay of their imboſomed malignancy, and how ſtrongly they were byaſt with affection to the ſaid Revolt, by not only delaying, and in a manner refuſing their aſſiſtance to their reducement; but by diſcountenancing that pious and ſo needfull devotion in others, and traducing them for it.</p>
            <p>We humbly move, that a due caution for (<hi>non eſt bis erare in Polemicis</hi>) of all ſuch inſincere, and ſo obviouſly diſaffected perſons, and that not any of the ſaid houſe, which cannot give an evident, manifeſt, or teſtimoniall of their good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to, and cordiall complyance with, the reformed Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and preſent power on foote, be intruſted with any power or jurisdiction whatſoever, But that it be forthwith wholly transferred on, ſuch as ſhall too ſecurely ſtand on their own integrities &amp; upright dealings, to need protection from great Perſonages to that end ſued unto; and accordingly admitted into their fraternity, a courſe frequently practiſed, and but lately, though not ſuccesfully (as on ſome Lords which we could inſtance in) attempted on ſome Collonels in the Army, for as we hope they have reſuſed it.</p>
            <p>And whereas Charity inciteth us to take care, that the ſame good uſe be made of the Cheſt-money for which it was intended, we can no longer content our ſelves with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite

            <p>
               <hi>To the Second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That from henceforth all places in and about the Navy, of what nature or quallity whatſoever, be ſubjected to a yearly Election; that ſo fidility and vigilance in their ſeverall charges and duties, may be in a better capacity to be preferred, to the great incouragement and advancement of the ſame, and the contraries, through the fear of an infamous diſplacing, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, or the ſubjects of them, for examples ſake juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled.</p>
            <p>That no Commander or other Officer whatſoever, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enjoy at one time any more then one place, either in his own name or clandeſtinely in any others: by receiving all or any of the portion of the Sallary thereto belonging; And whoſoever ſhall be truly detected of the ſame, be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with diſcharged of his proper place, and otherwiſe Multed as the nature of the crime ſhall deſerve. And if the tennor here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of extend to all offices, and places Military and Civill on the Land, it will we conceive be of excellent uſe in it ſelfe, and very gratefull to the publicke; but we ſhall not digreſſe, being ſo highly ſatisfied with the Armies <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> and Petition of the 11. <hi>Sept.</hi> laſt, that our hope to ſee all thoſe proviſions for the peoples freedom happyneſſe therein contained; and wherein, we profeſſe our concurrence ſhortly brought into act, we totally acquieſce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Third.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That every Captaine who is appointed for Command of ſhipps for convoyes, may have the victualling the ſhipp he ſo Commands, having the ſame proportionable allowance that the victuallers now, or in conſideration of the advance of price in comodities ſhould have; and that all other ſhipps who are onely appointed for guarding of the Coaſt, may have their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104758:6"/>proviſions provided in Magazines in the ſeverall Ports, or ſome of them moſt convenient along the Coaſt.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is deſired, the cettainty thereof occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſmall incouveniency that theſe duties of guard and convoy be diſtinguiſht, and certaine ſhips be more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly named, to have the charge of the convoy in and out of Marchants ſhips and goods; That ſo trade may be as highly advanced by this meanes with us, as it is by the ſame with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to our long impoveriſhment through default thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Fourth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That no Committee, or Commiſſioners of the Navy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, be permitted to ingroſſe, or impropriate ſervice (to their own ſhips, but that the proffers of others (when as much or more conducing to the publick good) according to common equity and liberty, may be accepted and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and that for future all Committees of the Navy may be admoniſhed to let the doors ſtand open to receive all proffers and Petitions <hi>Sans fraud,</hi> or other ſiniſter practiſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Fifth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That for the ſeverall pay every Captain thus employed for the convoying of ſhips, being ſuffered to victuall his own ſhip as aforeſaid, be allowed 10 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
               <hi>per menſem</hi> for his pay. And that every Captain guarding the Coaſt have alſo 10 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
               <hi>per menſem</hi> and ſome allowance for his table, for the entertainment of ſtrangers occaſioned by councells, or the like, and that every Maſter have 6 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
               <hi>per menſem,</hi> and every cheif Mate have 4 <abbr>l.</abbr>

               <hi>per menſem,</hi> the Gunner Boatſwaine, Carpenter, have 4 l. <hi>per menſem,</hi> and the Cooke be allowed 3 l. <hi>per menſem,</hi> and no other Officer belonging to the Gunner, Gun-roome or Boatſwaine, except each a Mate be allowed above foure Maſt mens pay from the State; but what the Gunner or Boatſwaine ſhall allow out of their own meanes.</p>
            <p>That the Steward, Quarter-Maſter, Gunners Mate, Boate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwains Mate, Carpenters mate, be allowed 105. <hi>per menſem,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:104758:6"/>fore maſt men clear of all charges have 20 s. <hi>per menſem</hi> which ſeverall ſums though to ſome, as to our ſelves may ſeeme to large, yet if granted may prevent the multiplicity of cheates formerly amounting to much more, and induce thoſe Seamen fallen off to returne to your ſervice.</p>
            <p>That the Miniſter and Chirurgion have ſuch allowance as the State ſhall thinke fit.</p>
            <p>That every Captaine with the approbation of the power electing him, may make choice of all his Officers in the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſhips.</p>
            <p>That all Captaines or Maſters of Marchant men ſhips be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Commanders in chief, may have to the full value of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pounds of his own adventure, and his bill of Portage, free of cuſtome and exciſe.</p>
            <p>That all Maſters mates have 15 l. of their own adventure upon the ſaid accompt.</p>
            <p>That all Chirurgions, Purſers, Gunners, Boatſwanes Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters and Cookes, have ten pounds upon the ſame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.</p>
            <p>That all their mates with Quarter-maſters and of their quallitie have eight pounds upon the ſame accompt.</p>
            <p>That all fore Maſt-men five pounds upon the ſame Accompts—</p>
            <p>That all ſuch as by ſufficient teſtimony-ſhall make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear they are not of ability either by charge of Children, or loſſe otherwiſe, to make good their above-ſaid adventurers accordingly, may be enabled to ſell the ſame at the end of the voyage, to him that will buy it, That thereby men may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to fight for defence of Ships and Marchants goods, (this being but in liew of our Ton Cuſtome free, formerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and ſince taken away.</p>
            <p>That the names of the ſeverall Captains, Maſters, Mates, Gunners, Boat-waynes, Carpenters, Cookes, Quartermaſters Miniſters, and Chirurgion, and four Maſt-men, with all other inferiour Sea-men be with the names of the ſeverall Ships and Pinnaces they ſerve in, inrolled, and the Pay eſtabliſht reſpectively paid them in whole, when in ſervice, and halle

            <p>And if any in what place ſoever maymed or dying in this ſervice of the State, ſhall leave, or have a wife and Children, or either of them to ſlenderly provided for to give them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſuſtenance for their ſubſiſtance, aliment &amp; education. And the State in a bleſſed imitation of the moſt flouriſhing Common-wealths of old, and the Netherlands at this inſtant, ſhall ordaine ſome certain proviſion for ſuch maimed perſons Relict, or Orphans ſutable to their ſeverall reſpective condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and exigencies. It will be an act not only well pleaſing to God, and worthy our profeſſion of Religion; but for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny demonſtrable reaſons of great utility in the mayne, ſuch donatives being in effect, but as a ſcattering before a harveſt, or as <hi>Saloman</hi> hath it, a caſting of bread upon the waters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payable in little time with greater abundance.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is and may be than all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected perſons being excluded. A ſufficient number of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Seamen for the ſervice of the Navy, cannot be rayed or found; We are confident theſe our humble deſires granted to the ſatisfaction of all wel-affected perſons: there ſhall be no ſuch neceſſity to indanger ſo principall a defence of the Kingdoms peace and ſafety, as is the Navy in the truſt of ſuch inveterate Enemies to it; but that it may be ſupplyed (and had; had we our deſires on the 5. of July laſt in our firſt Propoſalls formerly) with men of known affections and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity to the State.</p>
