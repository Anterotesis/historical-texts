            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Cardinall <hi>Mazarin</hi> is not like to ſubſiſt long by reaſon that being a Stranger, and one inclined to the Pope, he will be alwaies ſuſpected and hated.</p>
               <p>Upon Monday laſt the Couucell was aſſembled at St. <hi>Germain,</hi> where the King was preſent, and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the buſineſſes.</p>
               <p>Upon Saturday laſt he ſent for the Ambaſſadors to come to him the next day, unto which he gave audience, and told them hee would entertaine as good correſpondencie as before, and rather better.</p>
               <p>The Declaretion formerly made againſt <hi>Mounſieur</hi> the Kings Brother, about the Treaty with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was lately proued, and enregiſtred; <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Munier</hi> and <hi>Silleren,</hi> Councellors of the great Chamber, ſpoke very much in <hi>Mounſieurs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe alleadging, that it was ill to condemne a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his quallity before he was heard, ſince that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb facs="tcp:54959:5"/>
is not denyed to men of farre leſſe condition, and moſt guilty; That it is to draw the hatred of a Sonne of <hi>France,</hi> and to breed a hartburning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two great Brothers, and beſides that this ſhould redound upon the Kings renowne, and that it was fit to gather all the enqueſts, and informations together before his ſentence, but notwithſtanding all theſe reaſons.

               <p>Yet <hi>Mounſieur De Senetene</hi> was ſent to him to <hi>Bloys,</hi> with a moderation, and hopes of ſuppreſſion of that Declaration, in caſe that he behaveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe better. This was a great piece of pollicy, to ſhow that <hi>France</hi> was ſtill governed by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Genius, even after his death.</p>
               <p>The Marſhall of <hi>Breeze</hi> is in great favour with the King, he was lately with <hi>Mounſieur Baſſompierre,</hi> and laboureth much for his liberty, the King anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, he muſt ſtay a while.</p>
               <p>There is great diſſcention between the Marſhall of <hi>Breeze,</hi> and my Lady, by reaſon of the Will, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Anguien</hi> his Son, take part with the Marſhall of <hi>Breeze,</hi> and good reaſon too, becauſe the Cardinall left them nothing, they endeavour to have the Will annulled, if it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Aiguillon</hi> ſhall enjoy 800. M. <hi>per annum,</hi> beſides the Gold, Silver, Plate, and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables ſhe hath already. The Earle of <hi>Dublin</hi> was lately ſhot with a Piſtoll by <hi>Mr. De Bonnivet.</hi>

               <p>It is thought that Trafflicke and Commerce, will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden with <hi>Romans,</hi> by reaſon of the Audience denyed by the Pope, unto the Ambaſſador of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent offered to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, which both left <hi>Rome</hi> in a great rage and fury.</p>
