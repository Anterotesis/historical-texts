            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet sithens that tyme, sundry of the sayd kynges subiectes for priuate lucre, abusyng her Maiesties good intention notified in the sayde proclamation, haue sought to colour the goodes and marchaundize of the French, beyng her Maiesties enemies, both commyng out, and passyng into Fraunce, as apparently hath ben proued in sundry causes duelye examined and tryed, and remaynyng to be shewed. In respect wherof certayne of her Maiesties subiectes, which accordyng to theyr dueties be armed vpon the Seas, to offende the Frenche beyng enemies, haue ben more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous towardes some of the sayde kyng of Spaynes subiectes, in searchyng of the sayde deceiptes of colouryng of the Frenche goodes, and thervpon of late, sundrye complayntes haue ben made by certayne of the sayde Kynges subiectes, that certayne Englyshe men of warre, beyng vppon the Seas, haue molested them, and in some parte spoyled them. Wherof her Maiestie hath vpon continuance of her former intention towardes the mainteinance of good amitie with her sayde good brother the kyng of Spayne and his subiectes, appoynted speciall commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of trust, to haue an extraordinary power and aucthoritie, to heare, and spedely to determine and redresse all such complaintes, without delay of processe, and with more celeritie then is administred to any of her owne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall subiectes. In which proceding, although her Maiestie vnderstandeth, that her sayde good brothers subiectes receaue much satisfaction: yet for that the numbre of her subiectes and shippes of warre, that are presently vpon the Seas, and are lykely to go to the Seas this spryng, to the offence of the French, are so great and many, and of so diuers porte townes and countreys, as it appeareth very harde, howe a good accompt may be made, of euery of them beyng so many, specially considering the dayly colouryng of the French wares by the sayd kynges subiectes encreaseth manifestly. Therfore her Maiestie styll persistyng in her former fauour towardes her sayde good bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers subiectes, and to withstande all disorders agaynst her other frendes, hath for some more suretie towardes them, thought meete by aduise of her counsayle, to prouide as foloweth, whiche is as muche as can be deuised. Fyrst, her Maiestie strayghtly chargeth and commaundeth all maner her subiectes, that shall perceaue eyther on the Seas, or in any Port, Hauen, or Creke of this Realme, or in the Realme of Irelande, any person that may be suspected by any lykely meane, to haue hurt or endamaged any subiect of the kyng of Spaynes, or that shall haue any goodes or marchaundize, that shall seme to haue ben taken from any of the sayde kynges subiectes, duryng these warres with Fraunce, that they and euery of them, shall employe them selues to the best of theyr power, to apprehende, or cause to be apprehended, the persons so suspected to haue offended: for the whiche theyr doinges, they shal haue conuenient rewarde. And yf any shippe shall come into any Port, wherof there shalbe any suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the owners or occupyers therof haue dammaged any of the sayde kynges subiectes: the Uiseadmirall of that coast, or the Maior, or other head officer there, in the absence of the Uiseadmirall, shall cause the sayde ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and the persons therin suspected, to be stayed, vpon payne yf they shalbe therein negligent, to be punyshed as abbettours to the offendours, and therof, and of the proues or causes of suspition, shall immediatlye geue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the Commissioners appoynted for those causes of depredations, that immediate order be taken for tryall of the fact, accordyng to the tenour of theyr commission.</p>

And yf the parties can not, or wyl not geue such assuraunce: then the shyppes shall not be suffred to depart to the Seas, but knowledge shalbe geuen therof to the foresayde Commissioners. And yf the partyes refusyng to geue assuraunce of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent sureties, shall seme to be suspected that they haue not behaued them selues well towardes her Maiesties frendes, they shall also be stayed, vntyll the foresayde Commissioners shall determine therof.</p>
            <p>And because of late some complayntes haue ben made by certayne Scottysh men in generalitie, agaynst some Englyshe men of warre, for euyll vsyng of them vpon the Seas, wherein particuler orders are alredy geuen for tryall and redresse of the same: Her Maiestie wylleth, that such care be had of the well vsyng of the subiectes of her good syster the Quene of Scotes, as the great amitie betwixt theyr two Maiesties, and theyr countreys and people, doth necessaryly requyre. For that her Maiestie woulde haue nothyng omitted on her parte, that myght conserue, and encrease the same.</p>
