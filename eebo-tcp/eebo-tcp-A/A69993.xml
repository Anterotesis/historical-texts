         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving upon your reiterated
inſtances (which are ever
commands with me) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
this Treatiſe concerning the
Hiſtory of <hi>Chalcography</hi> &amp;c. I
thought my ſelf engag'd, to ſignifie
to the rest, that may poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
or Satisfaction, or Benefit
from it, to whom they are obliged
for the Publication of it. The
truth is, as it reſpects the pains
which I have taken, it bears not
<pb facs="tcp:52448:4"/>
the least proportion with my ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſerving you; but as you are
pleaſed to judge it uſeful for the
encouragement of the Gentlemen of
our Nation, who ſometimes pleaſe
themſelves with theſe innocent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions
(Collections worthy of
them for divers reſpects) and, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially,
that ſuch as are addicted
to the more Noble <hi>Mathematical
Sciences,</hi> may draw, and engrave
their <hi>Schemes</hi> with delight and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,
<hi>I</hi> have been induc'd to
think it more worthy your Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
and of my ſmall Adventure,
who profeſſe to have nothing ſo
much in my deſires, and which I
more avow the purſuite of, then
to employ the whole remainder of
the life, which God ſhall aſſigne
me, and that <hi>I</hi> can redeem from its
impertinencies, in contributing to
that great and auguſt deſigne, which
<pb facs="tcp:52448:4"/>
your illustrious, and happy <hi>Genius</hi>
do's prompt you to, of cultivating
the <hi>Sciences,</hi> and advancing of
uſeful knowledge, emancipated from
the ſtrong contentions, and little
fruit of the former; Envy, and
imposture of the latter Ages.</p>
            <p>Sir, This is not in the leaſt to
flatter you, nor can I have other
aime in it, then that by your great
Example, <hi>I</hi> might excite ſuch as
(like you) have Parts and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
to things that are glorious,
and wortby of them. Your ſtudies
are ſo mature and univerſal, your
travels ſo highly improv'd, and
your Experience ſo well eſtabliſh'd;
that, after <hi>I</hi> have celebrated the
Converſation which reſults from all
theſe perfections, it is from You a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
that <hi>I</hi> might deſcribe the
<hi>Character</hi> of an accompliſh'd <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
great, and worthy our Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
<pb facs="tcp:52448:5"/>
But though your modeſty
do's not permit me to run thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh
all thoſe Tranſcendencies;
yet, the World is ſufficiently inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by what you cannot conceal, that
<hi>I</hi> ſay nothing of ſervile, and which
will not abide the Teſt; ſo as <hi>I</hi> have
been often heard to exult in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
of this Conjuncture of ours,
which (ſince thoſe prodigies of
Virtue, the illuſtrious <hi>Ticho, Bacon,
Gilbert, Harvey, Digby, Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leo,
Peiresky, De Cartes, Gaſſendi,
Bernier</hi> [his Diſciple now in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi>]
and the late incomparable <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>como
Maria Favi</hi> &amp;c.) has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
us nothing, which will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the compariſon with you, when
<hi>I</hi> ſhall pronounce you (and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
your merits do challenge it)
the <hi>Phaenix</hi> of this latter Age.</p>
            <p>And now that I mention'd <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
Favi,</hi> I will not conceal with
<pb facs="tcp:52448:5"/>
what extaſie, and joy <hi>I</hi> lately found
his memory (which <hi>I</hi> have ſo much,
and ſo often heard mention'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
by ſuch as had the happineſs
to know him intimately) conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the eloquent pen of <hi>Monſieur
Sorbiere,</hi> in a diſcourſe of his to
<hi>Monſieur Vitre,</hi> concerning the
utility of great <hi>Travel</hi> and Forreign
Voyages; becauſe it approches ſo
neer to the <hi>Idea</hi> which <hi>I</hi> have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
and may ſerve as an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
and example to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of our Nation, who, for the
moſt part wander, and ſpend their
time abroad, in the purſuite of thoſe
vain and lower pleaſures, fruitleſs,
and altogether intollerable. But
<hi>Sir, I</hi> will crowd no more into
this Epiſtle (already too prolixe)
which was only deſign'd to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
this piece, and ſome other uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and more liberal diverſions
<pb facs="tcp:52448:6"/>
of this nature, which <hi>I</hi> cannot yet

to the beſt Advantage, it is by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining

               <hi>GIacomo Maria Favi</hi> of the
Houſe of the <hi>Mareſcotti</hi> of
<hi>Boulonia,</hi> died above thirty five
years of age, neer fifteen years
ſince, in the City of <hi>Paris. It is
a Hiſtory worthy of Record, and
that all the World ſhould take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of this incomparable Perſon, as
that great Wit and polite Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>
Monſieur Sorbiere <hi>do's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
him:</hi> For as much (<hi>ſayes
he</hi>) as it ſeems to be a very great
reproch, that neither <hi>Prince,</hi> nor
<hi>State</hi> have hitherto had the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
or the courage to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
what one particular perſon
alone did reſolve upon for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
benefit, and good of the
publick: For it was upon this
deſigne, that he engaged himſelf
<pb facs="tcp:52448:7"/>
expreſsly, making the moſt exact
obſervations, and collecting the
<hi>Crayons, Prints, Deſignes, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi>
and faithful <hi>Copies</hi> of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
could be encountered through
the whole <hi>Circle</hi> of the <hi>Arts</hi> and
<hi>Sciences;</hi> the <hi>Laws,</hi> and the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms</hi>
practiſed wherever he arived.
He had already acquired by ſtudy
a thouſand worthy and curious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
He <hi>Deſign'd</hi> excellently
well, underſtood the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi>
had penetrated into the
moſt curious parts of <hi>Medecine,</hi> and
was yet ſo far from the leaſt <hi>pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi>
that he would (when ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd)
play the <hi>Gallant</hi> as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely
as any man, and which he
was indeed able to do, enjoying a
plentiful Revenue of neer three
thouſand pounds ſterling a year,
which he ordered to be paid him
by Bills of Exchange, whereſoever
<pb facs="tcp:52448:7"/>
his Curioſity ſhould invite him.
But otherwiſe, truly his Equipage
was very ſimple, and his train re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to one only ſervant, which
he was wont to take in every town
where he made any ſtay. He had
already viſited <hi>Italy, Germany,
Poland, Swethen, Denmarke, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

himſelf of all that were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and conſpicuous for all ſorts
of curioſities, whereof he carefully
took notice; but eſpecially he made
an intimate acquaintance with one
<hi>Monſieur Petit,</hi> a very rare and
<pb facs="tcp:52448:8"/>
curious perſon, and indeed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſembling the <hi>Genius</hi> of this
noble Gentleman, as being one,
who for theſe fifty years paſt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
a wonderful ardor for the

in the reſearch of all eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable,
and worthy Inventions, as
that it is a thouſand pitties (and a
thing not to be conceived indeed
without infinite regrette) that
this <hi>Age</hi> of ours could never yet
approch him. So laudable and
worthy of praiſe, has his expenſes
been upon divers <hi>Machines</hi> and

in particular; together with an ample enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration

their Workes.</head>
            <p>THe Art of <hi>Engraving</hi> and working off,
from Plates of Copper, which we
call <hi>Prints,</hi> was not yet appearing, or born
with us, till about the year 1490. which
was near upon 50 years after <hi>Topography</hi>
had been found out by <hi>John Guittemberg;</hi> or
who ever that lucky perſon were (for 'tis
exceedingly controverted) that firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
the Invention. There is a collection
of antient <hi>Offices</hi> adorned with ſeveral Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
(if ſo we may terme thoſe wretched
Gravings in the infancy of this art) where
the <hi>Devil</hi> is but one great blot (as indeed
he is the Fouleſt of the Creation)
and the reſt of the Figures <hi>Monochroms</hi>
as ridiculous and extravagant; though
ſtill as the invention grew older, refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and improving upon it. One of the
antienteſt Gravings which we have ſeen, to
which any mark is appos'd hath M. 3. and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52448:36"/>
M. C. in one of the corners of the plates
and it was long that they uſed the initia
letters of their names, only, and ſometimes
but one; as in thoſe of <hi>Lucas. Albert D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

did frequently add the year of the
Lord, and his own age from ten to four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
&amp;c. performing ſuch things as might
ſhame moſt of the beſt Maſters, for the
true and ſteady deſign, the incomparable
proportion, and ſtroake of his Graver: But
<hi>Iſrael, Martin Schon,</hi> and the <hi>Todeſco</hi> (wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were of the very firſt, as far as we can col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
who publiſhed any works of this kind
under their names, wrought off by the
Rolling-Preſſe, and whoſe ſlender attempts
gave incouragement to thoſe who have
ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George Vaſari,</hi> who has been exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
curious in this enquiry, attributes the
firſt invention of this Art to one <hi>Maſo Fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerra</hi>
a <hi>Florentine,</hi> about <hi>anno</hi> 1460, which
exceeds our former computation by 30.
years; but then we are to conſider by what
progreſſe and degrees; for it was firſt only
in Silver, to fill with a certain <hi>Encauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which having engraved, he did only fume,
taking off the impreſſion with a moyſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and a Rolling pin. This mean com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
was yet afterwards purſu'd
by <hi>Baccio Baldini</hi> a Goldſmith, his Country
man, whoſe works coming to the ſight of
<hi>Andrea Mantegna</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> invited that
great Painter to give him ſome deſignes of
his own for his encouragement; and from
thence it travell'd into <hi>Flanders</hi> to one
<hi>Martine</hi> of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> whoſe works (as we
obſerv'd) were uſually counterſign'd with
M. the firſt whereof were the five <hi>wiſe</hi> and
five <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> and a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> which
was ſo well cut, that <hi>Gerardo</hi> a <hi>Florentine</hi>
Painter would needs copy it: After this he
publiſhed his four <hi>Evangelists,</hi> our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
and the twelve <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> a <hi>Veronica,</hi> S. <hi>George,
Chriſt</hi> before <hi>Pilate,</hi> an <hi>aſſumption</hi> of the <hi>B.
Virgin,</hi> one of the rareſt that ever he did;
beſides that St. <hi>Anthonies temptation,</hi> which
was ſo well performed, that <hi>Michael
Angelo</hi> (exceedingly raviſhed with it)
would needs waſh it over with his own
hands.</p>
            <p>The next that appeared of note was the
formerly mention'd and renowned <hi>Albert
Durer,</hi> who flouriſhed about the years 1503.
and who had performed wonders both in

Copper and Wood, had he once fortun'd
upon the leaſt notion of that excellent
manner, which came afterwards to be in
vogue, of giving things their natural diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and agreeable ſweetneſſe, the defect of
which Sir <hi>H. Wotton</hi> does worthily perſtringe

proceed, <hi>Albert</hi> being very young ſet forth
our <hi>Lady,</hi> ſome deſignes of <hi>Horſes</hi> after the

Horſeback, Diana</hi> chaſtiſing a Nymph who
flies to a <hi>Satyr</hi> for protection, in which he
diſcovered his admirable talent and skill
in expreſſing Nudities: A Country man
and Woman playing on Bagpipes, with
Poultry, &amp;c. about them. <hi>Venus,</hi> or the
temptation of the Stove; his two St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophers,</hi>

ſeveral Stamps in Wood, proof whereof
he gave in the decollation of St. <hi>Jo. Bapt.</hi>
with <hi>Herodias,</hi> Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> St. <hi>Stephen,
Lazarus, S. George,</hi> a <hi>paſſion</hi> in great, the

Garden, deſcent into <hi>Limbo,</hi> and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
with eight more Prints of this
ſubject, which are held to be ſpurious:
All theſe be publiſhed <hi>anno</hi> 1510. The
year following, he ſet forth the life of our
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52448:37"/>
               <hi>Lady</hi> in twenty ſheets rarely conducted.
The <hi>Apocalyps</hi> in fifteen ſheets, of which
the Painters have made ſufficient uſe;
<hi>Christ</hi> bemoaning our ſins; Then applying
himſelf to grave in Copper again, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
his <hi>Melancholia,</hi> three different <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donas,</hi>
with thirty pieces beſides concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>paſſion,</hi> and which being afterwards
imitated by that rare Artiſt <hi>Marco Antonio</hi>
(who had procur'd them at <hi>Venice</hi>) and
publiſhed for Originals (ſo exactly it ſeems
they were perform'd) did ſo inſenſe <hi>Albert,</hi>
that he made a journey to <hi>Venice</hi> expreſly
to complain of the injury to the <hi>Senate,</hi>
and obtain'd at laſt, that <hi>M. Antonio</hi> ſhould
no more be permitted to ſet his mark or
<hi>Plagia,</hi> which was all he could procure of
them. Another emulator of <hi>Alberts</hi> was
<hi>Lucas van Leyden,</hi> whom at his returne
into <hi>Germany</hi> he found had well neer over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
him for the ſweetneſſe of his <hi>Burine,</hi>
though ſomething inferiour of deſign: Such
were a <hi>Chriſt</hi> bearing the Croſſe, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his <hi>Crucifixion, Sampſon, David</hi> on
a horſe, the Martyrdome of <hi>S. Peter, Saul,</hi>
and <hi>David,</hi> the ſlaughter of <hi>Goliah,</hi> the
famous <hi>Piper, Virgil</hi>'s, and ſome other heads,
all which works did ſo inflame his Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt
<hi>Albert,</hi> that in a laudable revenge,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52448:38"/>
he publiſh'd his arm'd <hi>Cavalier</hi> or Dream,
in which the brightneſſe and luſtre of the
Armour and Horſe is rarely conducted:
Then in the year 1512 he ſet forth ſix other
ſmall ſtories of the <hi>paſſion,</hi> which <hi>Lucas</hi> alſo
imitated, though hardly reach'd: Then a
<hi>S. George, Solomons</hi> Idolatry; the Baptiſme
of our Lord, <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thisbie, Ahaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus</hi>
and <hi>Heſter,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe again incited
<hi>Albert</hi> to publiſh that <hi>Temperantia,</hi> whom
he elevates above the clouds, <hi>S. Euſtathius</hi>
and the Hart, a moſt incomparable cut;
his Deaths head in a Scutcheon, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
German Coates full of rare Mantlings
and invention. Alſo <hi>S. Hierom,</hi> a <hi>Christ
and twelve Apostles</hi> in ſmall: <hi>anno</hi> 1523.

with divers other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucas</hi> again in emulation of theſe, ſet
forth his <hi>Joſeph</hi> and four <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> the
Angels appearing to <hi>Abraham; Suſanna,
David</hi> praying, <hi>Mordecay</hi> triumphing;
<hi>Lot,</hi> the Creation of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> the
ſtory of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel, viz. anno</hi> 1529. But
what procur'd him immortal glory was his

of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> in which he exceeded himſelf
both for the work and ordinance; the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52448:38"/>
diſtances being better conducted then <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts,</hi>
and indeed ſo well obſerv'd, as gave
light even to ſome of the beſt Painters that
ſucceeded him; ſo much are they oblig'd
to this Art, and to this rare Workman:
He graved alſo ſeveral <hi>Madona's,</hi> our bleſſed
<hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Apostles;</hi> together with divers
<hi>Saints, Armes</hi> and <hi>Mantlings,</hi> a <hi>Mountebanc</hi>
and many more.</p>
            <p>But to return now into <hi>Italy</hi> from whence
we firſt ſallied; in the time of <hi>Raphael
Urbine</hi> flouriſhed the renouned <hi>Marco An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio,</hi>
who graved after thoſe incomparible
pieces of that famous Painter, to whom
he was ſo dear, that the honour he has
done him to poſterity will appear, as long
as that <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Raphael</hi> remains in the
Popes Chamber at the <hi>Vatican,</hi> or any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
of it laſts; though to ſpeak truth,
even of this rare Graver, the Pieces which
he hath publiſhed ſeem to be more eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
yet for the choice and imitation, then
for any other perfection of the <hi>Burine;</hi> as
forming moſt of his figures and touches of
too equal force, and by no means well
obſerving the diſtances, according to the
rules of Perſpective, that tenderneſſe, and
as the <hi>Italians</hi> terme it, <hi>Morbidezza,</hi> in
the <hi>hatchings,</hi> which is abſolutely requiſite
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52448:39"/>
to render a piece accompliſh'd and without

            <p>We have recited above, what he Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
after <hi>Albert Durer;</hi> But being at <hi>Rome,</hi>
and applying himſelf to <hi>Raphael,</hi> he cut
that rare <hi>Lucretia</hi> of his, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd

deſigning: Alſo the Martyrdome of <hi>St. Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi>

him ſo much Fame and Credit; but this

that elevated, and ſolid bodies in <hi>Nature,</hi>

            <p>To arrive at this, you muſt firſt draw

expedient to gain a maſtery in this Addreſs,
will be to imitate ſuch <hi>prints,</hi> and <hi>cuts,</hi> as

Such (amongſt plenty of others) are thoſe
of <hi>Henry Goltzius:</hi> The <hi>Sadelers, Harman,

aiming at the <hi>Original,</hi> then paining of your

and therefore the antient Painters (ſayes <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lostratus</hi>)
more eſteem'd a certain true and
liberal Draught, then the neatneſs of the
Figure, as he expreſſes it in <hi>Amphiaraus</hi>'s
Horſe, ſweating after the conflict; ſince
Drawings and Deſignes are not to be like
<hi>Polycletus</hi>'s <hi>Canon,</hi> which took its ſeveral
parts, from as many perfect bodies, by a
ſtudied, and moſt accurate Symmetrie: It
ſhall ſuffiice that the prime conceptions of
our Artiſt be perform'd with leſs conſtraint;
a coal or penſil of black-lead will ſerve the
turn, reſerving the ſtronger, and deeper
touches for a ſecond paſs of the hand over
your work; and laſt of all, penning the
<hi>Contours,</hi> and out lines with a more even
and acute touch, neatly finiſhing the hatches
with a reſolute, conſtant and ſlowing
hand; eſpecially, as it approaches to the

fainter ſhadowes, terminating them in
loſt and miſty extreams, and thwarted (if
you will <hi>counter-hatch</hi>) at equal, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
intervals (but not till the firſt be dry)
or, if with ſingle ſtroaks (which to us ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the moſt natural, and agreeable effects)
with full, deep hatches, and their due di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhings.</p>
            <p>But it would haply be objected, that
theſe accurate Deſignes of the <hi>pen,</hi> were
never eſteemed among the nobler parts of
<hi>Drawing,</hi> as for the moſt part appearing to
finnicall, ſtiff and conſtrain'd: To this, we
reply; that the remark is not impertinent,
as commonly we find by experience: But
it has not proceeded from the leaſt defect

pre-eminence in all places next the King;
then come the Guards in the reere, which
conſiſt of a more inferiour Nobility: Thus
farr the <hi>Historian:</hi> We know not how
this Inſtance may in theſe dayes be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted;
but certainly the Courts of Princes
were in former Ages, compos'd of men of
the greateſt virtue and talents above the

their <hi>Fautors</hi> and Protectors famous, by
leaving ſuch marks of their admired Virtue,
as did eternize their merits to after Ages.</p>
            <p>Thus it was, that <hi>Myron, Polycletus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Phydias, Lyſippus</hi> and others of the

they received no ſuch encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

ſuch as thoſe whereof <hi>Vitruvius</hi> does in the

them to the World, though

            <p>And here we ſhould have put a period

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52448:77"/>
we think not impertinent here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite,
as briefly as the demonſtration will
permit.</p>
            <p>The principal end of a <hi>Graver</hi> that would
coppy a Deſign, or piece compos'd of one,
or more Objects, is, to render it correct
both in relation to the <hi>Draught, Contours</hi>
and other particularities, as to the Lights
and ſhades on the Front, flying or turning,
in bold, or faint touches; ſo as may beſt
expreſs the <hi>Reliefe;</hi> in which <hi>Gravers</hi> have
hitherto, for the moſt part, rather imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one another, then improved, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
upon Nature; ſome with more,
ſome with fewer ſtroaks: having never
yet found out a certain and uniforme

their ſtroaks with aſſurance, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
where they are to determine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
manifeſtly offending the due rules of

            <p>If in truth Nakeds, and other polite
Bodies were ſo formed, as that we might
detect the courſe, and inclination of the
<hi>Threads, Fibers,</hi> and <hi>Grain,</hi> ſo as we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it in <hi>Stuffs, Cloth, Linnen</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the tiſſue, Tenor or range of the Threads
and <hi>Wales</hi> (as they call them) which is
eaſily imitated, both as to their inclinations,
and diſtances from the point of ſight.</p>
            <p>But ſince we are much at a loſs, and can
perceive no ſuch direction or clue in Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
and other ſmooth ſurfaces, it were
haply worth the while, to find out ſome
expedient which ſhould aſſiſt the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this affair, and that might encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the difficulty upon other <hi>terſe</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
objects, by forming ſuch ſtroaks, and
directors upon them in our Imagination;
obſerving, that there are ſome parts in them
commonly to be diſtinguiſhed from the

would conceive ſuch lines, or hatches on

well fanci'd upon thoſe leſſer, and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate

            <p>To effect this, the following <hi>Ichoniſme</hi> is

            </p>
            <p>But here by the way, let no man think
we mean by this <hi>Coloree</hi> (as they term it)
in Drawing and Graving, ſuch a poſition
of the <hi>Hatches</hi> as the <hi>Chevalier Wolſon</hi> has

by: But a certain admirable effect, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merging
from the former union of Lights,
and ſhadowes; ſuch as the Antients would
expreſſe by <hi>Tonus,</hi> or the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> in
their <hi>Proportions,</hi> and imitated in this <hi>Art,</hi>
where the ſhades of the Hatches intend,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52448:82"/>
and remit to the beſt reſemblance of
<hi>painting,</hi> the Commiſſures of the light
and dark parts, imperceptably united, or
at leaſt ſo ſweetly conducted, as that the
alteration could no more certainly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd,
then the <hi>Semitons,</hi> or <hi>Harmoge</hi> in <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi>
which though indeed differing; yet it
is ſo gentle, and ſo agreeable, as even ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhes
our ſenſes, by a ſecret kind of charme
not to be expreſſed in words, or diſcerned
by the ignorant. And this it is, which has
rendred it ſo difficult to coppy after <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes</hi>
and <hi>Painting;</hi> and to give the true
heightnings, where there are no hatchings
to expreſs them, unleſs he, that Copies,
Deſign perfectly himſelf, and poſſeſs more
then the ordinary talent and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Gravers,</hi> or can himſelf manage
the Pencil. But to return to <hi>Prints</hi> again,
we are to underſtand, that what the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
do many times call <hi>excellent,</hi> does not
alwayes ſignifie to the advantage of the
<hi>Graver;</hi> but more frequently, the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,</hi>
conſiſting in the <hi>lineaments, proportion</hi>
and <hi>ordonance,</hi> if theſe be well, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly
perform'd, and for which we have
ſo recommended the practiſe of this Art
to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Painters in <hi>chap. IV.</hi> Though,
to ſpeak of an accompliſh'd piece indeed,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52448:82"/>
it is the reſult of integrall cauſes only, and
where they univerſally encounter.</p>
            <p>We do farther add, that for this reaſon,
<hi>copies</hi> are in <hi>Prints</hi> much more eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
then in <hi>paintings,</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
more facile alſo to imitate, as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
all one kind of Inſtrument, and fewer
wayes of expreſſion: But if there be a
difficulty in it, thoſe which are <hi>Etched</hi> in
A. F. make it moſt conſpicuous; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the nature of the <hi>plates,</hi> and quality
of the <hi>Waters,</hi> and their operations, may
ſometimes fall out to be ſo very unlike:
But, to diſcern an <hi>Original prtnt</hi> from a
<hi>Copy print</hi> (not to ſpeak of ſuch plates
as have been retouch'd, and therefore of
little value) is a knack very eaſily attain'd;
becauſe 'tis almoſt impoſſible to imitate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<hi>hatch,</hi> and to make the ſtroaks of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
and equal dimenſions, where every
the leaſt defect, or flaw in the Copper it
ſelf, is ſufficient to detect and betray the
Impoſture, as in that little <hi>Deſce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> from
the croſs</hi> of <hi>Hanibal Carraccio</hi> (already

abſolutely impoſſible to conterfeit. In the

upon other particulars of the Art, and the

Laſtly, that A. F. gives a tenderneſs to
<hi>Landskips, Trees</hi> and <hi>Buildings</hi> ſuperiour to
that of the <hi>Burine</hi> (though that exceed
infinitely in Figures) may be ſeen in that
of <hi>Iſraels</hi> view of the <hi>Louvre</hi> before recited,
and in ſome other works where there is
an induſtrious and ſtudied mixture, as in
that ſecond manner of <hi>Voſterman's</hi> which

            <p>It was in the former Chapter that we

<hi>Eilhardus Lubinus</hi> in an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Stetin,</hi> has celebrated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
an Inſtitution of youth by this <hi>Art:</hi>
Such as was alſo the Deſign of that Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
of a Man, <hi>La Martelay,</hi> who had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
collected and digeſted ſuch a choice num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>cuts,</hi> and ſo univerſall, as by which
he more then pretended (for he really
effected it) to reach all the <hi>ſciences</hi> by
them alone, and that with as much cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and infinite more expedition,
then by the moſt accurate method that
was ever yet produced: What a <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
of this <hi>Jo. Amos Commenius</hi> in his <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis
ſenſualium pictus</hi> gives us in a <hi>Nomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clator</hi>
of all the Fundamental things and
Actions of Men in the whole World, is
publick, and I do boldly affirm it to be a
piece of ſuch excellent uſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, as that the
like was never extant; however it comes
not yet to be perceived: A thouſand
pitties it is, that in the Edition publiſhed
by Mr. <hi>Hoole,</hi> the <hi>cuts</hi> were ſo wretchedly
engraven: I do therefore heartily wiſh
that this might excite ſome gallant and
publick minded perſon, to augment and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52448:88"/>
proceed farther upon that moſt uſefull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
which yet comes greatly ſhort of the
perfection it is capable of, were ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
made, and the <hi>prints</hi> reformed
and improved to the utmoſt, by the skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hand of ſome rare Artiſt. In the mean
time, what a Treaſury of excellent things
might by this expedient be conveyed, and
impreſſed into the <hi>waxen Tables</hi> and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
of <hi>children;</hi> ſeeing, there is nothing
more prepoſterous, then to force <hi>thoſe</hi> things
into the <hi>Eare,</hi> which are <hi>viſible,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
objects of the eye, For <hi>picture,</hi> is a kind
of <hi>Univerſal Language,</hi> how diverſe ſoever
the tongues and vocal expreſſions of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Nations</hi> which ſpeak them may appear;
<hi>Solet enim pictura tacens loqui, maximeque pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe,</hi>
as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> has it.</p>
            <p>So as if ever, by this is that long ſought for
Art moſt likely to be accompliſh'd: Nor
can any words whatever hope to reach
thoſe deſcriptions, which in a numberleſſe
ſort of things, Picture do's immediately,
and as it were at one glance, interpret to
the meaneſt of capacities: For inſtance, in
our <hi>Herbals,</hi> books of <hi>Inſects, Birds, Beaſts,
Fiſhes, Buildings, Monuments,</hi> and the reſt
which make up the <hi>Cycle</hi> of the Learned
<hi>Abbot;</hi> ſome of them haply never ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52448:88"/>
or ſo much as heard of, as <hi>Aelian</hi>

And what do we find more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt

of their <hi>Heros</hi> and Illuſtrious prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors?
ſuch as <hi>Atticus,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Varro</hi>
collected; all which conſider'd, we do
not doubt to affirm, that by the application
of this <hi>Art</hi> alone, not only <hi>Children;</hi> but
even <hi>Stripplings</hi> well advanc'd in Age,
might receive incredible advantages, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory
to their entrance into the <hi>Schoole
Intellectual,</hi> by an Univerſal, and choice
Collection of <hi>prints</hi> and <hi>cuts</hi> well deſign'd,

which ſhould contain, as it were,
a kind of <hi>Encyclopaedia</hi> of all intelligible,

to be conceived of what advantage this
would prove for the Inſtitution of <hi>Princes</hi>

And if (as 'tis obſerv'd) it furniſh us
with <hi>Maximes</hi> to diſcern of general Defects
and Vices, eſpecially, in what relates to the

not to be eſteem'd ſo inconſiderable as by

when I had well conſider'd it (ſo
