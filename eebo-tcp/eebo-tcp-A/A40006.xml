         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FRiends, Conſider your <hi>Calling,</hi> 'tis <hi>High,</hi> 'tis <hi>Holy.</hi>
'tis out of the World, its <hi>beggarly Rudiments,</hi> its
<hi>falſe Ways</hi> and <hi>Worſhips,</hi> its <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Faſhions,</hi>
with all the <hi>Abominations, Prophanations, Sports</hi> and <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
Into what?</hi> even the <hi>glorious Liberty of the Sons
of God,</hi> to be made conformable unto Chriſt our Head,
to be in him <hi>Holy</hi> as he is <hi>Holy,</hi> then to be Heirs with
him, joynt Heirs with Chriſt, and to ſit with him in the
heavenly places; O bleſſed Exchange! unſpeakable
Love! What manner of Perſons ought we to be? ſaith
the honeſt Heart; Oh! let none of us walk unworthy
of ſuch <hi>Mercy,</hi> but keep a living ſence thereof upon our
hearts, continually, watching over our Thoughts, Words
and Works, that we in all may glorifie the Lord our God,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95584:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who is worthy to be <hi>Loved, Feared, Reverenced</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,</hi>
from henceforth and forever.</p>
            <p>The matter chiefly upon my Heart is this, That as
there is now a more <hi>publick Teſtimony</hi> born to Gods bleſſed
Truth, than when we had liberty to aſſemble our ſelves
together in our Meeting-houſes; ſo now let our care be
more to anſwer our Profeſſion; <hi>for we are as a Candle in
a Candleſtick, not under a Bed or Buſhel;</hi> yea, as <hi>a City ſet
upon a Hill,</hi> publickly taken notice of, to be of that number,
of them, who dare not omit the <hi>Aſſembling our ſelves
together, as the manner of ſome is, but we muſt confeſs him
before men, who</hi> (we know) <hi>will not deny us before his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father;</hi> we muſt bear our Teſtimony to the bleſſed
Truth he hath made us Partakers of, though in ſuch
Hazards: Let this, <hi>my dear Friends,</hi> engage our Souls
to all Circumſpection in our Lives and Converſations,
that we give no occaſion to the Enemy to blaſpheme or
ſpeak Evil of that holy Profeſſion we are called to hold
forth in the midſt of a perverſe and crooked Generation,
amongſt whom we ought to ſhine as Lights, <hi>that men
ſeeing our holy chaſte Converſation, coupled with fear, may
glorifie our Father;</hi> to this ſurely every honeſt Heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but ſay, <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> as ſaith my Soul.</p>
            <p>Friends, the Enemy of our Souls is buſie, both within
and without, yea, <hi>the Devil ſtill goes about as a roaring Lyon,
ſeeking which of us he can devour;</hi> and he may ſuffer us
to make a Profeſſion, even in the ſtricteſt manner, whilſt
he endeavours to ſpoil us of our Poſſeſſion, he will not
diſturb us, if he can but draw into looſeneſs or lightneſs,
'tis poſſible you may ſpeak the <hi>plain Language</hi> without
interruption, if you will but uſe it in <hi>fooliſh Talking</hi> and
<hi>idle Jesting;</hi> and although you do not appear in the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95584:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of this wanton Age in your <hi>Apparel,</hi> but in
<hi>plain Cloathing,</hi> yet if you do ſuffer your Hearts to be in
the <hi>Nicities, Coſtlineſs</hi> and <hi>Curioſities,</hi> and let them be as
like the World as may be, <hi>Lace</hi> only excepted (if you
can but eſcape the Reproofs of them who abſtain from
every appearance of Evil, and hate the Garments ſpotted
with the fleſh) then the Soul's Enemy will indulge you
therein, and you may for a time poſſibly, in this day of
Tryal, <hi>come frequently to Meetings, ſtand in the Streets,
bear the Gain-ſaying of Scoffers,</hi> and the <hi>haling before Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates;</hi>
but if any of you indulge a looſe careleſs Spirit,
ſuch <hi>make void their Suffering, invalidate their Teſtimony,
and fall ſhort of the Reward and Comfort of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright,</hi> and
ſo will not hold out to the end. This I write, not to
accuſe any particular, but do beſeech all to ſtand upon
their <hi>Watch,</hi> that they ſuffer not this Spirit to prevail in
them, or if it have any place in any that makes a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Gods pure holy <hi>Truth,</hi> to give no reſt to their
Eyes, nor ſlumber to their Eye-lids, till they are turned
to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus in their Conſciences, and
liſten to its Reproofs, which now, as heretofore, bears
a faithful Witneſs againſt every evil Word and Work,
and as it is heard, believed in and obeyed, will give
ſtrength to overcome all and every thing that is of that
Nature.</p>
            <p>Oh, <hi>my Friends!</hi> preſs forward in the holy Warfare;
for of a truth, <hi>Victory</hi> may be obtained, if you run well,
and continue to the end, you ſhall have a Crown of
Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friends,</hi> Let me expoſtulate the matter a little with
you; I know there is many, that when the Enemy of
mans Soul comes to tempt to any groſs Sins, can have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95584:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no entrance, their Souls abhor this or the other Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
ſo as to groſs Enormities he may come and have
nought in Thouſands; but the great danger lies here in
little things, and they think their Souls may live in this
<hi>little Zoar,</hi> if they eſcape the Sins of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and ſuch
like.</p>
            <p>But here's a <hi>Snare,</hi> here's a <hi>Rock</hi> that many are ſplit
on, taking liberty in little matters, in <hi>Decency,</hi> till <hi>Pride</hi>
ſits in the Chair, in exceſſive <hi>Merriment,</hi> which ſome call
<hi>Cheerfulneſs,</hi> till it come to ſuch <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>immoderate
Laughter</hi> as the wiſe men call <hi>Madneſs,</hi> appears in their
Converſations; <hi>They muſt not be too demunitive</hi> (ſome will
ſhy) <hi>they muſt be friendly to all, free to diſcourſe with any,</hi>
and this may be good in its place; but for want of taking
up the daily Croſs, and not being upon the <hi>Watch,</hi> they
become one with the <hi>idle Talker</hi> and <hi>fooliſh Jeſter;</hi> and ſo
in many other caſes; As, <hi>We may be Angry and ſin not,</hi>
which is true; but letting themſelves looſe, here the
Enemy takes an Advantage, and in the Night ſows his
evil Seed, and the wrathful haſty ſpirit gets up, grows
ſtrong, till that which is tender, meek and lowly in
themſelves, and others they converſe with, is grieved,
and groans under the Oppreſſion. And from this Spirit
there's no deliverance till they come again to learn of
him that's meek and lowly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they did at their firſt
Convincement, when after great and ſore Travels they
did find reſt unto their ſouls, in him that was meek and
lowly.</p>
            <p>And its at theſe Breaches, the Enemy being entred,
the more groſſer and grievous ſins enter, and ſo even the
old Iniquity is revived, and the <hi>ſin that ſo eaſily beſets gets
up again;</hi> and by giving way to this vain Imagination,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95584:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>That ſuch ſmall things will not hurt,</hi> the fooliſh Heart comes
to be darkned, &amp; the poor Soul that once was raiſed, comes
to be enthralled, and a good Condition to be loſt, and
it will be harder with ſuch to be reſtored, than it was
for them to be brought into the knowledge of the Truth
at the beginning.</p>
            <p>And this alſo hath been known by ſad Experience,
when any one hath let in <hi>Grief,</hi> and joyned the Powers
of their Souls with it, here the Enemy of mans Peace
lays ſeige, ſometimes tempting the poor bewildred ſoul
to <hi>diſpair of the Mercy of the Lord,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>Curſe God
and dye,</hi> and ſometimes to <hi>lay violent hands on it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh, <hi>my dear Friends!</hi> what need is here to ſtand upon
the <hi>Watch,</hi> to keep in the pure fear of the Lord, even all
the day long? for if any Affections or Paſſion inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be ſuffered to harbour in the Soul, the danger is great.</p>
            <p>And yet further, what hath been ſaid in theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
particulars, may be ſaid alſo <hi>of letting in the Worldly
Spirit,</hi> which none ever knew whilſt it had rule in their
hearts, but at the entrance thereof, as the Eye of the
Mind has been towards the Lord, to be kept and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
from every Evil that would grieve the good
Spirit, or hinder Communion with it, the Lord opens
the myſterious workings of this Spirit in the honeſt
Heart, and ſtrengtheneth him with all Diligence to keep
the <hi>Watch;</hi> and here the Soul eſcapes this Snare, that is
ſo privily laid, that many are enſnared and taken, and
call it <hi>good Husbandry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O remember the great Love of our Lord and Saviour
Jeſus Chriſt, who hath commanded his Diſciples,</hi> To caſt
all their care upon God, who careth for them, and hath given
himſelf for us, that he might deliver us from this preſent evil World.</p>
            <p>

And let any experienced one, into whoſe hands this
may come, conſider, Have you at any time let in the
Spirit of Prejudice, (more eſpecially upon the account of
Religion) againſt any Perſon? Let the cauſe be right or
wrong, yet if once it be let in, and you converſe with
it, and give liberty to your Thoughts therein, how apt
are you to receive any Report that may tend to make the
Breach wider? how ready it is for any prejudiced Perſon
to take wrong Meaſures of right Actions, as thus, If
any in the pure Love of God, that thinketh no evil,
watch over his Brother for good, or the Antients in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
who are unblameable in their Lives and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
who have (if the word <hi>Rule</hi> can be born) ruled
for God, and are truly worthy of <hi>double Honour;</hi> if ſuch
knowing the Wiles of <hi>Satan,</hi> as alſo the Terrors of the
Almighty, ſhall propoſe good and wholſom Methods to
keep all within the Church of Chriſt ſweet and clean, in
which the honeſt hearted rejoyce, yet the prejudiced
ſpirit will cry out preſently of <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> of <hi>Laws,
Church Canons</hi> and <hi>Impoſition;</hi> though at the ſame
time thoſe who were in Chriſt before them, and by
Grace were made Members of that Body of which Chriſt
is the Head, declare to ſuch, <hi>That its but the godly Care of
our Brethren to preſerve every Member in its place and good
Order.</hi> Much might be written, but I did only intend
to hint at theſe things, and beg of the Lord they may be
enlarged in my ſoul, as in every honeſt Heart, as there
may be any occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh Friends! <hi>I am deeply grieved in the Conſideration
of theſe things, and its the cry of my ſoul to the God of all
Grace,</hi>
               </hi> Ariſe, O Lord, and rebuke this Gain-ſaying
Spirit; Ariſe thou mighty God, whoſe Fan is in

down into thy pure fear (which makes and keeps the
heart clean) every one that makes a Profeſſion of
thy pure holy Truth.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude with that which was principally
upon my heart in the beginning, in which let me expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate
again with any or every honeſt Heart, into
whoſe hands this may come, that hath but known
or experienced any thing of the Power of God to make
clean the Veſſel, and that hath been convinced of the
Evil of their Ways, Words and Works, and in the Light,
Strength and Power of God hath been made able to judge
down every appearance of Evil in themſelves, that hath
not had Holineſs to the Lord ſtamped thereon. Oh!
why ſhould any ſuch turn again to Folly, and build
again thoſe things they once pulled down, or allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

            <p>Friends, <hi>Truth <hi>is unchangeably pure, and that which

Husband,</hi> &amp; he provideth all things neceſſary for my Spiritual
as well as Temporal Well-being, and if I do not depart from
him, he hath promiſed, <hi>He will never leave me nor forſake
me?</hi> Why then ſhould I allow any Evil Spirit to lodge within
me, any accurſed thing to approach his Temple, to hinder me
in my near Approaches unto him? Why ſhould I ſuffer a wild,
wanton airy Spirit to get up, that will unavoidably make me
vain in my Converſation, ſeeing I could not be redeemed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95584:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there-from by Silver nor Gold, or any corruptible thing, but
with the precious Blood of Jeſus Chriſt? Shall I trample
under Foot the Blood of Chriſt? or ſhall my light unſavoury
Words and Actions cauſe any to ſay, <hi>It is an unholy thing?</hi>
Shall I deny my <hi>Redemption,</hi> and my <hi>Redeemer</hi> (even
to all them that behold) by my vain Converſation? God
forbid.</p>
            <p>Or, if at any time there hath been a neglect, the
Watch has not been kept, nor the Prayer offered, but
as it were for a little time, the Soul forgetting that it
was cleanſed, entreth into the Temptation, and toucheth
with the unſanctifi'd thing, yet as the Heart abides honeſt,
the pure holy Fear will ſpring again in ſuch a Breaſt, and
that Man or Woman will ſoon ſee from whence they are
fallen, and will cry, with <hi>David, Reſtore me, O Lord, to
my former Condition; take not thy holy Spirit from me;
ſet thou a Watch before my Mouth, that I offend not with
my Tongue: O Lord, keep the Door of my Lips,</hi> &amp;c. This
is the care of the Upright, that whether in Eating or
Drinking, in Speaking or in Silence, all might be done to
the Praiſe and Glory of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friends,</hi> we above all the Families of the Earth,
bear our Teſtimonies to Chriſt's Appearance in ſpirit,
and to that <hi>Grace which hath appeared to all men, teaching us</hi>
(who have received it) <hi>to deny <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and worldly Luſts,
and to live Soberly, Godly and Righteouſly in this preſent
World. And ſhall we allow our ſelves in any thing that is
juſtly reproveable? God forbid; I will ſet a Watch over my
Thoughts,</hi> ſaith the honeſt Heart, <hi>for my God knoweth them
afar off; and I muſt give an account for every idle Word; I
will watch over my Eyes, for my Lord hath ſaid,</hi> Whoſoever
looketh upon a Woman and luſteth after her, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95584:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Adultery with her already in his Heart; <hi>and the
Apoſtle</hi> James <hi>ſaith,</hi> Whoſoever ſeemeth to be Religious,
and bridleth not his Tongue, that mans Religion is vain.
<hi>And Oh! that all my Works might witneſs the Lord at hand,
ſeeing they muſt follow me after Death.</hi> [Here is Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
indeed] bleſſed is he who worketh out his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with Fear and Trembling; ſuch ſhall be ſafe, and
no evil Tidings can make them afraid; ſuch ſhall hold
out in all Tryals, for they are builded upon a ſure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner
Stone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friends,</hi> This is a Day wherein Satan deſires, yea, doth
indeed winnow all Profeſſions, bleſſed is that Perſon and
that People who partake of the benefit of our Lords
praying, for he hath prayed, That their Faith fail not;
and him the Father heareth alwayes; bleſſed are they
who watch and keep their Garments unſpotted, their
Converſation will be ſuch as will adorn the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now unto God only wiſe, who comforts his People with his
Rod and with his Staff, he who knows our frame, and will
not ſuffer any who fear his Name to be tempted above what
they are able to bear, and in the fitteſt Seaſon will deliver
<hi>Jacob</hi> out of all his Troubles, To him be all Power,
Might, Majeſty, with Dominion and holy Praiſes given
and aſcribed from this time henceforth and forever,
ſaith my Soul.</hi>
