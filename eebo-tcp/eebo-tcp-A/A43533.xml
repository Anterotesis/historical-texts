            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54835:4"/>
it continued in that point, to have given us a waft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age as ſpeedy as our longing. Two hours before night it came about to the Weſtward, and the tide alſo not befriending us, our paſſage became tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and troubleſome. The next day being dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the glory of God, in memory of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> we took the benifit of the ebb to aſſiſt us againſt the wind. This brought us out of the ſight of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the floud enſuing compelled us to our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor.</p>
            <p>I had now leiſure to ſee <hi>Gods wonders in the deep,</hi> wonders indeed to us, which had never before ſeen them: but too much familiarity had made them none other than the Saylers play-fellows. The waves ſtriving by an inbred ambition which ſhould be the higheſt, which foremoſt: precedency and ſuper-eminency was equally deſired, and each en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed it in ſucceſſion. The wind more covetous in appearance to play with the water than diſturbe it, did onely rock the billow, and ſeemed indeed to dandle the Ocean. You would at another time have thought, that the Seas had onely danced at the Winds whiſtle, or that the Wind ſtraining it ſelf to a treble, and the Seas by a diſdiapaſon ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the baſe, had tuned a Coranto to our Ship. For ſo orderly we roſe and fell, according to the time and note of the billow, that her violent agitation might be thought to be nothing but a nimble Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liard filled with Capers. The nimbleneſs of the waves, and correſpondency of our Bark unto them, was not to all our company alike pleaſing: what in me moved onely a reverend and awful pleaſure, was to others an occaſion of ſickneſs:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54835:4"/>
their heads giddy, their joynts enfeebled, their ſtomacks loathing ſuſtenance, and with great pangs avoiding what they had taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In their mouthes nothing ſo frequent, as that of <hi>Horace,</hi>

                  <l>Hard was his heart as braſs, which firſt did ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</l>

               </q>
Whether it be that the noiſom ſmels which ariſe from the ſaltneſs and tartneſs of that Region of waters, poiſoneth the brain? or that the ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and unequal motion of the Ship ſtirreth and unſettleth the ſtomack, or both? we may conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture with the Philoſphers rather than determine. This I am ſure of, that the Cabbins and Deck were but as ſo many Hoſpitals or Peſt-houſes filled with diſeaſed perſons: whilſt I and the Marriners one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made good the hatches: here did I ſee the ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nation of that Kingdom ſolace themſelves in the brim of the waves, rejoycing in the light and warmneſs of the day, and yet ſpouting from their mouthes ſuch quantity of waters, as if they had purpoſed to quench that fire which gave it. They danced about our veſſel, as if ſhe had been a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving May-pole; and that with ſuch a delightful <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,</hi> that you never ſaw a Meaſure better troaden with leſs art: And now I know not what wave bigger than the reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> toſſed up our Ship ſo high, that I once more ken'd the coaſt of <hi>England</hi>; an object
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54835:5"/>

                     </gap>ntini,</hi> ſo may I ſay of the <hi>Normans</hi>: for my part I could never yet find, where that great wit of theirs lay. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that as the <hi>French</hi> in general are termed the <hi>King's aſſes:</hi> ſo may theſe men peculiarly be called the <hi>Aſſes of the French,</hi> or the verieſt Aſſes of the reſt. For what with the unproportionable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54835:7"/>
rents which they pay to their Lords on the one ſide, and the immeaſurable taxes laid upon them by the King on the other; they are kept in ſuch a perpetuated courſe of drudgery, that there is no place for wit or wiſdom left amongſt them. Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the Mother and Nurſe of thoſe two qualities; and therefore the <hi>Romans</hi> (not unhappily) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed both the condition of a Free-man and a diſcreet and modeſt perſonage by this one word <hi>Ingenuous.</hi> Why the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould lay a greater burden upon the backs of this Nation, than their fellows, I cannot determine. Perchance it is becauſe they have been twice conquered by them (once from King <hi>John,</hi> and again from <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth) and therefore undergo a double ſervitude. It may be to abate their natural pride and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs.

This a French Gentleman of good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding told me, that it was generally conceited in <hi>France,</hi> that the <hi>Normans</hi> would ſuddenly and unanimouſly betray their Country to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> were their King a <hi>Cath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But there is a further cauſe yet of their beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and poverty, which is, the litigiouſneſs and frequent going to law (as we call it:) <hi>Ortelius,</hi> however he failed in the firſt part of the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, in the concluſion of it hath done them juſtice. <hi>Mais en generall</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>its ſont ſcavans an paſſible en proſſes &amp; pluideries.</hi> They are pretty well verſed in the querks of the Law, and have wit more than enough to wrangle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:54835:7"/>In this they agree exactly well with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of our Country of <hi>Norfolke. Ex infima plebe non pauci reperiuntur</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Cambden) qui, ſi nihil ſit litium, lites tamen ex ipſis jaris apicibus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere callent.</hi> They are pretty fellows to find out quirks in Law, and to it they will, whatſoever it coſt them. Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> ſpake not at random, or by the gueſs: for beſides what my ſelf obſerved in them at my being once among them in a <hi>Colledge-progreſs</hi>; I have heard, that there have been no leſs than 340. <hi>Niſi prius's</hi> tried there at one <hi>Aſſiſes.</hi> The reaſon of this likeneſs between the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I conjecture to be, the reſemblance of the ſite and the ſoyl: both lie upon the Sea, with a long and ſpacious coaſt, both enjoy a Country champain, little ſwell'd with hils, and for the moſt part, of a light and ſandy mould. To proceed to more particulars, if there be any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Provinces, it is onely this, that the Country of <hi>Normandy</hi> is much better, and the people of <hi>Norfolk</hi> are ſomewhat the richer.</p>
               <p>For indeed the Country of <hi>Normandy</hi> is enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fat and liking ſoil, ſuch a one, <hi>quae demum votis reſpondet avari Agricolae,</hi> which may ſatisfie the expectation of the Husbandman, were it never ſo exorbitant. In my life I never ſaw Corn-fields more large and lovely extended in an equal level, almoſt as far as eye-reach. The wheat (for I ſaw little Barley) of a fair length in the ſtalk, and ſo heavy in the ear, that it even bended double, you would think the grain had a deſire to kiſs the earth its Mother; or that it purpoſed by making it ſelf away into the ground, to ſave the Plow-man his

Thick it groweth, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly void of weeds, that no garden can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to be kept cleaner by art, than theſe fields are by nature. Paſture ground it hath little, and leſs meadow: yet ſufficient to nouriſh thoſe few Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel they have in it. In all the way between <hi>Diepe</hi> and <hi>Pontois,</hi> I ſaw but two flocks of Sheep, and then not above forty in a flock.

this ſecureth the Haven from the violence of the weather, and is a great ſtrength to the Town a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the attempts of any forces, which ſhould aſſault it by Sea, the Town lying within theſe Mountains a quarter of a mile up the channel. The Town it ſelf is not uncomely, the ſtreets large and well paved, the houſes of an indifferent height, and built upright without any juttings out of one part over the other. The Fortifications (as they ſay, for we were not permitted to ſee them) are very good and modern, without, ſtones, within, earth. On the top of the hill a Caſtle finely ſeated, both to defend the Town, and on occaſions to command it. The Garriſon conſiſteth of ſixty men, in pay no more, but when need requireth the Captain hath authority to arm the Inhabitants: The preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour is the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> who alſo is the Governour of the Province, intruſted with both thoſe charges by <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, 1619. An action wherein he ſwarved ſomewhat from the enſample of his Father, who never committed the military command of a Country (which is the Office of a Governour) and the cuſtody of a Town of war or a Fortreſs unto one man. The Duke of <hi>Biron</hi> might have as great a courteſie from that King, as the moſt deſerving of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: he had ſtuck cloſe to him in all his adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, received many an honourable fear in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and indeed was <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> both the ſword and buckler of the <hi>French Empire.</hi> In a word, he might have ſaid to this <hi>Henry,</hi> what <hi>Silius</hi> in <hi>Tacitus</hi> did to <hi>Tiberius.

The reaſon was, becauſe Governours of Provinces which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in chief ought not to have the command of places and fortreſſes within their Government: there was alſo another reaſon, and more enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, which was, that the petitioner was ſuſpected to hold intelligence with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> whoſe Town it was. The ſame <hi>Henry</hi> though he loved the Duke <hi>Eſpernon</hi> even to the envy of the Court, yet even to him alſo uſed he the ſame cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore when he had made him Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of <hi>Xanictoigne</hi> and <hi>Angoulmois,</hi> he put alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands the Towns of <hi>Mets</hi> and <hi>Boullogne,</hi> places ſo remote from his ſeat of Government, and ſo diſtant one from the other, that they did rather diſtract his power than encreaſe it.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>England</hi> have been well, and for a long time, verſed in this Maxime of State. Let <hi>Kent</hi> be one of our enſamples and <hi>Hampſhire</hi> the other. In <hi>Kent</hi> at this time the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> (or as the <hi>French</hi> would call him) the <hi>Governour</hi> is the Earl of <hi>Montgomery</hi>; yet is <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle in the hands of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and yet <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> in the cuſtody of Sir <hi>Edward Hobby.</hi> Of which the one commandeth the Sea, and the other the <hi>Thames</hi> and the <hi>Medway.</hi> In <hi>Hampſhire</hi> the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> is the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Town and Garriſon of <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> is intruſted to the Earl of <hi>Pembroke.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>But King <hi>Lewis</hi> now raigning in <hi>France,</hi> minded not his Fathers actions, when at the ſame time alſo he made his Confident <hi>M. Luines</hi> Governour of <hi>Picardy,</hi> and of the Town and Cittadel of <hi>Amiens.</hi> The time enſuing gave him an inſight of that ſtate-breach; for when the Dukes of <hi>Eſpernon, Vendoſme, Longueville, Magenne</hi> and <hi>Nemours,</hi> the Count of <hi>Soiſons</hi> and others ſided with the Queen Mother againſt the King; the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened this <hi>Dieppe,</hi> and had not peace ſuddenly followed, would have made good, maugre the Kings forces. A town it is of great importance, King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth uſing it as his <hi>Aſylum,</hi> or City of Refuge, when that League was hotteſt againſt him. For had he been further diſtreſſed, from hence might he have made an eſcape into <hi>England,</hi> and at this door was the entrance made for the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh forces, which gave him the firſt ſtep to his Throne. The Town hath been pillaged and taken by our <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, in his warrs againſt <hi>Philip Auguſtus,</hi> and in the declining of our affairs in <hi>France,</hi> it was a moneth together beſieged by the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> but with that ſucceſs which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attendeth a falling Empire.</p>
               <p>The number of the Inhabitants is about 30000. whereof 9000. and upwards are of the Religion, and have allowed them for the exerciſe of their Religion the Church of <hi>Argues,</hi> a Village ſome two miles diſtant.

Before it, went a bell continually tinckling, at the ſound whereof all ſuch as are in their houſes, being warned that then their God goeth by them, make ſome ſhew of reverence; thoſe which meet it in the ſtreet, with bended knees and elevated heads doing it honour. The Proteſtants of this bell make an uſe more reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and uſe it as a warning or a watch-peal, to avoid that ſtreet through which they hear it coming. This invention of the Bell hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of <hi>Turciſme,</hi> it being the cuſtom there, at their Canonical hours, when they hear the cryers bawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſteeples; to fall proſtrate on the ground whereſoever they are, and to kiſs it thrice, ſo doing their devotions to <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The carrying it about the ſtreets hath no queſtion in it a touch of the <hi>Jew:</hi> this Ceremony being borrowed from that of the carrying about the Ark upon the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Prieſts. The other main part of it, which is the adoration, is derived from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; there never being a people but they which afforded divine honour to things inanimate. But the people indeed I cannot blame for this idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous devotion, their conſciences being perſwaded, that what they ſee paſs by them is the very body of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54835:11"/>
their Saviour. For my part could the like beleif poſſeſs my underſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could meet it with a greater reverence, then their charge can enjoyn me. The Prieſts and Doctors of the people are to be condemned onely, who impoſe and inforce this ſin upon their bearers, and doubtleſs there is a reward which attendeth them for it. Of ſtanding it is ſo you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, that I never met with it before the year 1215. Then did Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> ordain in a Council holden at <hi>Rome,</hi> that there ſhould be a Pixe made to cover the Bread, and a Bell bought to be rung before it. The adoration of it was enjoyned by Pope <hi>Honorius Anno Dom.</hi> 1226. Both afterwards encreaſt by the new ſolemn Feaſt of <hi>Corpus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti</hi> day by Pope <hi>

Such a punie is this great God of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>Lactantius</hi> in his firſt book of Inſtitutions againſt the Gentiles taxeth the wiſe men of thoſe times of infinite ridiculouſneſs, who worſhipped <hi>Jupiter</hi> as a God, <hi>Cum eundem tamen Saturno &amp; Rhea genitum confiterentur,</hi> ſince themſelves ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knew his original.

               <p>It is now time to go on in our journey to <hi>Roven.</hi> The Cart ſtayeth, and it is fit we were in it; Horſes we could get none for money, and for love we did not expect them: we are now mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Chariot, for ſo we muſt call it. An Engliſh man thought it a plain Cart, and if it needs will
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54835:11"/>
have the honour of being a Chariot, let it, ſure I am it was never ordained for a triumph. At one end were faſtened three carkaſſes of Horſes, and three bodies which had been once Horſes and now were worn to dead Images. Had the ſtatue of a man been placed on any one of them, it might have been hang'd up at an Inn door to repreſent Saint <hi>George</hi> on horſe-back: ſo liveleſs they were and ſo little moving; yet at laſt they began to crawl, for go they could not. This converted me from my former hereſie, and made me apprehend life in them, but it was ſo little, that it ſeemed onely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to carry them to the next pack af Hounds. Thus accomodated we bad Farewell to <hi>Diepe,</hi> and proceeded with a pace ſo ſlow, that we thought our journey to <hi>Roven</hi> would prove a moſt perfect Emblem of the motion of the ninth Sphere, which was 49000. years in finiſhing. But this was not our greateſt miſery: The rain fell on us through our Tilt, which for the many holes in it we would have thought a net. The durt brake plentifully in upon us through the rails of our Chariot, &amp; the unequal and unproportionable pace of it ſtartled almoſt every bone of us. I proteſt I marvel how a French-man durſt adventure in it. Thus endured we all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of a journey, and the danger of three ſeveral deaths, drowning, choaking with the mire, and breaking of the wheel, beſides a fear of being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed before we came to our Inn, which was ſix French miles from us. The mad Duke that in the Play undertook to drive two Snails from <hi>Millaine</hi> to <hi>Muſco,</hi> without ſtaffe, whip, or goad; and in a bravery to match him, for an experiment would

               <p>On the left hand we ſaw <hi>Argues,</hi> once famous for a ſiege laid about it by our <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, but waſted ſpeedily by the French. It is now (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I told you) the Pariſh Church of <hi>Diepe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> their Preachers were Mr. <hi>Courteau</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mondeme,</hi> who had each of them an yearly ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, fifty pound or thereabouts. A poor pay, if the faithful diſcharge of that duty were not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unto it ſelf above the value of gold and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. To inſtance in none of theſe beggerly Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages we paſt through: we came at laſt unto <hi>Toſtes,</hi> the place deſtinate to our Lodging, a Town like the worſer ſort of Market Towns in <hi>England.</hi> There our Charioter brought us to the ruines of an houſe, an Alehouſe I would ſcarce have thought it, and yet in ſpite of my teeth it muſt be an Inn, yea, and that an honourable one too, as <hi>Don Quixot's</hi> Hoſt told him. Deſpair of finding there either bedding or victuals, made me juſt like the fellow at the Gallows, who when he might have been reprei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, on condition he would marry a Wench, which there ſued for him, having veiwed well, cried to the Hangman to drive on his Cart. The truth is, <hi>I' eſchappay du tonnere etrencheu en l'eſ lair,</hi> according to the French proverb; I fell out of the frying-pan into the hot fire. One of the houſe (a ragged fellow I am ſure he was, and ſo moſt likely to live there) brought us to a room ſomewhat of kindred to a Charnel-houſe; as dark and as dampiſh: I confeſs it was paved with brick at the bottom, and had towards the Orchard a pretty hole, which in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54835:12"/>
former times had been a window, but now the glaſs was all vaniſhed. By the light that came in at the hole, I firſt perceived that I was not in <hi>England.</hi> There ſtood in the chamber three beds, if at the leaſt it be lawful ſo to call them. The foundation of them was of ſtraw, ſo infinitely thronged toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the wooll-pack which our Judges fit on in the Parliament were melted butter to them; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this lay a medley of flocks and feathers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſowed up in a large bag (for I am confident it was not a Tick) but ſo ill ordered, that the knobs ſtuck out on each ſide of it, like a crabtree-cudgel. He muſt needs have fleſh enough that lieth upon one of them; otherwiſe the ſecond night would wear out his bones. The ſheets which they brought for us were ſo courſe, that in my conſciente no Marriner would vouchſafe to uſe them for a ſail: and the Coverlid ſo bare, that if a man would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to reckon the threeds, he need not miſs one of the number. The Napery of the Table was ſutable to the bedding, ſo foul and durty, that I durſt not conceive it had ever been waſhed above once, and yet the poor cloth looked as briskly, as if it had been promiſed for the whole year enſuing to ſcape many a ſcouring. The Napkins were fit companions for the cloath; <hi>

               <p>Let us now walk into the Kitchen, and obſerve their proviſion, and here we found a moſt terrible execuſion committed on the perſon of a Pullet.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54835:13"/>
My Hoſteſs, cruel woman, had cut the throat of it, and without plucking off the feathers, tare it into pieces with her hands, and afterwards took away skin and feathers together, juſt as we ſtrip Rabbets in <hi>England.</hi> This done, it was clapt into a pan, and fried into a ſupper. In other places where we could get meat for the ſpit, it uſeth to be preſently broached, and laid perpendicularly over the fire: three turns at the moſt diſpatcheth it, and bringeth it up to the table, rather ſcorched than roaſted; I ſay, where we could get it, for in theſe raſcally Inns you cannot have what you would, but what you may, and that alſo not at the cheapeſt. At <hi>Pontoiſe</hi> we met with a Rabbet, and we thought we had found a great purchaſe. Larded it was, as all meat is in that Country, otherwiſe it is ſo lean, it would never endure the roaſting. In the eating it proved ſo tough, that I could not be perſwaded that it was any more than three removes from that Rabbet which was in the Ark. The price half a Crown Engliſh: My Companions thought it over dear, to me it ſeem'd very reaſonable, for certainly the graſs that fed it was worth more than thrice the money: but I return to <hi>Toſtes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is time, you might perchance elſe have loſt the ſight of mine Hoſteſs and her Daughters, you would have ſworn at firſt bluſh they had been of a bloud, and it had been great pitty, had it been otherwiſe. The ſalutation of <hi>Horace, O mater pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chra, filia pulchrior,</hi> was never ſo ſeaſonable as here. Not to honour them with a further chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter let this ſuffice that their perſons kept ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>decorum</hi> with the houſe and furniture, that one
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54835:13"/>
could not poſſibly make uſe of <hi>Tullies, Quam diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari dominaris domino!</hi> But this is not their luck onely. The Women not of <hi>Normandy</hi> alone, but generally of all <hi>France</hi> are forced to be contented with a little beauty; and ſhe which with us is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the vulgar; would amongſt them be taken for a Princeſs. But of the French Women more, when we have taken a view of the Dames of <hi>Paris,</hi> now onely ſomewhat of their habit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Their habit in which they differ from the reſt of <hi>France,</hi> is the attire of their heads, which hangeth down their backs in faſhion of a vail. In <hi>Roven</hi> and the greater Cities, it is made of linnen pure and decent, here and in the villages it cannot poſſibly be any thing elſe than an old diſh-clout turned out of ſervice, or the corner of a table-cloth reſerved from waſhing. Their beſt condition is not alwayes viſible, they ſhew it onely in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or when you are ready to depart, and that is their begging. You ſhall have about you ſuch a throng of theſe ill faces, and every one whining out this ditty, <hi>Pour les ſervantes</hi>; that one might with greater eaſe diſtribute a dole at a rich mans funeral, then give them a penny: Had you a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to give them unasked, their importunity will prevent your ſpeedieſt bounty. After all this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate begging, their ambition reacheth no higher than a <hi>Sol</hi>: He that giveth more out-bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth their expectation, and ſhall be counted a ſpend-thrift.</p>
               <p>But the principal ornaments of theſe times are the men-ſervants, the raggedſt regiment that ever I yet looked upon. Such a thing as a Chamberlain
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54835:14"/>
was never heard of among them, and good clothes are as little known there as he. By the habit of his attendants a man would think himſelf in Gaole, their clothes either full of patches, or elſe open to the skin. Bid one of them wipe your boots, he preſently hath recourſe to the curtains; with thoſe he will perhaps rub over one ſide, and leave the other to be made clean by the Gueſt. It is enough for him that he hath written the coppy. They wait alwayes with their hats on their heads, and ſo alſo do ſervants before their Maſters: Attending-bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed is as much out of faſhion there as in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key.</hi> Of all <hi>French</hi> faſhions in my opinion the moſt unfitting and unſeeming. Time and much uſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled me to all other things, which at the firſt were offenſive, to this irreverent cuſtom I returned an enemy. Neither can I ſee how it can chooſe but ſtomack the moſt patient, to ſee the worthieſt ſign of liberty uſurped and profaned by the baſeſt of ſlaves. For ſeeing that the French paiſants are ſuch infamous ſlaves unto their Lords and Princes; it cannot be, but that thoſe which are their ſervants muſt be one degree at the leaſt below the loweſt condition.</p>
               <p>Certainly among the Ancients this promiſcuous covering of the head was never heard of, it was with them the chief ſign of freedom, as is well known to thoſe which are converſant with antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The <hi>Lacones</hi> a people of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> after they had obtained to be made free Denizens of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> in ſign of their now gotten liberty would never go into the battel, <hi>niſi pileati,</hi> but with their hats on. Amongſt the <hi>Africans,</hi> as it is written
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54835:14"/>
of <hi>Alexander, ab Alexandro,</hi> the placing of an hat on the top of a ſpear, was uſed as a token to incite the people to their liberty which had been oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Tyrants: Per pileum in baſt â propoſitum ad libertatem proclamari.</hi> But among the <hi>Romans</hi> we have more variety. The taking off the hat of <hi>Targuinius Priſcus</hi> by an Eagle, and the putting of it on again, occaſioned the <hi>Augures</hi> to propheſie unto him the Kingdom; which fell out accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. In their Sword-playes when one of their <hi>Gladiators</hi> had with credit ſlain his adverſary, they would ſometimes honour him with a <hi>Palm,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a Hat, of theſe the laſt was the worthier; the Palm onely honouring the Victor; this alſo enfranchiſing the receiver; therefore conferred commonly on him which killed moſt men in the Theaters: Hence the complaint of <hi>Tertuſlian lib. de Spectaculis cap.</hi> 21. <hi>Qui inſigniore cuiquam ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide leonem poſcit, idem gladiatori atroci Rudem petat (Redis</hi> was another token of enfranchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>&amp; pileum proemium conferat.</hi> In their common <hi>Forum</hi> or <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> when they purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to manumit any of their ſervants, their cuſtom alſo was, after the <hi>Lictor</hi> or <hi>Sergeant</hi> had regiſtred the name of the party manumitted, to ſhave his head, and give him a cap, whence according to <hi>Roſinus, ad pileum Vocare,</hi> is to ſet one at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his <hi>Chiliades</hi> maketh the hat to be the ſign of ſome eminent worth iu him that wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it. <hi>Pileus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>inſigne ſpectatae, virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> On this he conjectureth, that the putting on of caps on the heads of ſuch as are created <hi>Doctors</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:54835:15"/>
or <hi>Maſters</hi> had its original. In the Univerſities of <hi>England</hi> this cuſtom is ſtill in force, the putting on of the Cap being never performed but on the ſolemn <hi>Comitia,</hi> and in the preſence of all ſuch as are either auditors or ſpectators of that dayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe: When I was <hi>Regent,</hi> the whole houſe of <hi>Congregation</hi> joyned together in a petition to the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> to reſtore unto us the <hi>jus pileo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> the licence of putting on our caps at our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like meetings, which priviledge time and the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of our <hi>Vice-Chancellors</hi> had taken from us. Amongſt other motives we uſed the ſolemn form of creating a Mr. in the <hi>Arts</hi> by putting on his cap, and that that ſign of liberty might diſtinguiſh us that were the <hi>Regents</hi> from thoſe boyes which we were to govern: which requeſt he graciouſly granted. But this <hi>French</hi> ſaucineſs had drawn me out of my way. An impudent familiarity, which I muſt confeſs did much offend me, and to which I will ſtill profeſs my ſelf an open enemy. Though <hi>Jack</hi> ſpeach <hi>French,</hi> I cannot endure that <hi>Jack</hi> ſhould be a Gentleman.</p>

                  <hi>I<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ly</hi> the firſt we ſet out for <hi>Roven</hi>; in ten hours our Cart dragged us thither, the whole journey being in all ſix miles <hi>French</hi>; admirable ſpeed. About three of the clock in the afternoon we had a ſight of the Town, daintily ſeated in a valley on the River <hi>Seine</hi>: I know not any Town better ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated (<hi>Oxford</hi> excepted) which indeed it much reſembleth, I mean not in bigneſs but in ſcituation. It ſtandeth on all ſides environed with Mountains, the North excepted, and hath a large and pleaſant walk of meadow by the river ſide, to the South-Eaſtward, as <hi>Oxford</hi> hath towards <hi>Iffley.</hi> It is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the principal River of <hi>France,</hi> diſtant from the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of that Countrey fifty miles Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh or thereabouts; as <hi>Oxford</hi> on the <hi>Thames</hi> and from <hi>London</hi>: watered alſo it is with two ſmall Rillets, <hi>Roſee</hi> and <hi>Renelle,</hi> as the other with <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> and <hi>Evenlode.</hi> The difference is, that <hi>Oxford</hi> is ſeated ſomewhat higher on the ſwelling of an hill, and a little more removed from thoſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which environ it, and that the Rivers which run through ſome part of <hi>Roven,</hi> do onely waſh the precincts of the other. The buildings are in ſome places wood, in ſome ſtone, in others both. The houſes without juttings or overlets four ſtories high, and in the front not very beautiful. The
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54835:16"/>
moſt promiſing houſe which mine eyes met with was that of Mr. <hi>Boniface,</hi> who being of obſcure parents; and having raiſed himſelf a fortune in the wars againſt the <hi>League,</hi> here built a receptacle for his age. It is faſhioned after the manner of new buildings in <hi>London,</hi> compoſed all of dainty white ſtone, ſquare and poliſhed. On the partition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the firſt ſtory and the ſecond it hath theſe words engraven, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t &amp; Virtute Martisopus; Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanda via amore &amp; armis.</hi> A Motto ſutable to his riſing.</p>
               <p>The other buildings of note are the <hi>Bridge</hi> (for I as yet omit the Houſe of Parliament and the Churches) and the Town wall by it. The Bridge whilſt it was all ſtanding, was thought to have been the faireſt and ſtrongeſt piece of that kind in all <hi>France,</hi> it conſiſted of twelve arches large and high, there now remain but ſeven of them, the reſt being broken down by the Engliſh, in the falling of their affairs in <hi>France,</hi> the better to make good the Town againſt the French. The River is here about the breadth of the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Fullham.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the River and the Town wall is the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> or meeting place of the Merchants, paved with broad and even pebble-ſtones; in breadth up to the wallwards thirty yeards, in length a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. A fine walk in fair weather. All along the bankſide lay the Ships, which by reaſon of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bridge come up hither, and on occaſion high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; a good turn for <hi>Paris.</hi> The wall for the length of an hundred yeards is as ſtreight as one may lay a line; of a juſt height, and compoſed of ſquare and excellent ſtone ſo cunningly laid, that I never
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54835:16"/>
ſaw the ſide of a Noble mans houſe built more handſomly. But it is not onely the beauty of the wall which <hi>Roven</hi> delighteth in, there muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what alſo be expected of it for ſtrength. To which purpoſe it might ſeem indifferently well, were there ſome addition of earth within it. It is well helped on the outſide by the breadth and depth of the ditches, but more by St. <hi>Katharines</hi> Fort ſeated on an hill at the Eaſt ſide of it. A Fort which, were it ſtrengthned according to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern art of fortifying, would much aſſure the Town, and make it at once both a ſlave and a Commander. The <hi>Marſhal</hi> D'c <hi>Anere,</hi> when he was Lieutenant here for the <hi>Queen-Mother,</hi> began to fortifie this Mountain, <hi>Quilleboeuſe</hi> and other places of importance; but upon his death they were all razed. What were his projects in it, they know beſt which were acquainted with his ambition. Certainly the jarrs which he had ſown among the Princes, one with the other, and between them and the King, ſhew that they were not intended for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>There are in <hi>Roven</hi> thirty two Pariſh Churches, beſides thoſe which belong to <hi>Abbeys</hi> and <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Houſes; of which the moſt beautiful is that of St. <hi>Audom</hi> or <hi>Owen,</hi> once Arch-biſhop of this City. The ſeat and Church of the Arch-biſhop is that of <hi>Noſtre-dame,</hi> a building far more gorgeous in the outſide than within. It preſents it ſelf to you with a very gracious and majeſtical front, decked with moſt curious imagery, and adorned with three ſtately Towers. The firſt called <hi>La tour St. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi>; the ſecond <hi>La tour de beaurre</hi> (becauſe it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54835:17"/>
was built with that money which was raiſed by Cardinal <hi>D' Amboyſe,</hi> for granting a diſpenſation to eat butter in the <hi>Lent</hi>) and a third built over the Porch, or great Door, wherein is the great Bell ſo much talked of: Within it is but plain and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, ſuch as common Cathedral Churches uſually are, ſo big, ſo faſhioned. Behind the high Altar at a pillar on the left hand is the remainder of the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi>'s Tomb, which for ought I could diſcern was nothing but an Epitaph, ſome three yeards high in the Pillar. I ſaw nothing in it, which might move the envy of any Courtier to have it defaced, unleſs it were the title of <hi>Regent du Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaume de France,</hi> which is the leaſt he merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Somewhat Eaſtward beyond this is our <hi>Ladies Chappel,</hi> a pretty neat piece, and daintily ſet out. There ſtandeth on the top of the Screen the Image of the <hi>Virgin</hi> her ſelf between two Angels. They have attired her in a red Mantle laced with two gold laces, a handſom ruffe about her neck, a vail of fine lawn hanging down her back, and (to ſhew that ſhe was the Queen of Heaven) a Crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her head. In her left arm ſhe holds her Son in his ſide coat, a black hat and a golden hat-band. A jolly plump Lady ſhe ſeemeth to be, of a flaxen hair, a ruddy lip, and a chearful complexion. 'Twere well the Painters would agree about the limming of her; otherwiſe we are like to have as many Ladies as Churches. At <hi>Noſtre dame</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> ſhe is taught us to be brown, and ſeemeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what inclin'd to melancholy, I ſpeak not of her different habit, for I envy her not her changes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54835:17"/>
of apparel. Onely I could not but obſerve how thoſe of St. <hi>Sepulchres Church en la rue St. Denis,</hi> hath placed her on the top of their Screen in a Coape, as if ſhe had taken on her the zeal of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and were going to make a bloudy ſacrifice of her Son. They of <hi>Noſtre-dame in Amiens</hi> have erected her Statue all in gold, with her Son alſo of the ſame mettal in her arms, caſting beams of gold round about her, as the Sun is painted in its full glory. Strange Idolatries! On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the pariſh Church of <hi>Tury in la Beauſe</hi> ſhe is to be ſeen in a plain petticoat of red, and her other garments correſpondent. In my mind this hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt proportion to her eſtate, and will but ſerve to free their irreligion from an abſurdity. If they will worſhip her as a Nurſe with her Child in her arms, or at her breaſt, let them array her in ſuch apparel as might beſeem a Carpenters Wife, ſuch as ſhe might be ſuppoſed to have worn before the world had taken notice that ſhe was the Mother of her Saviour. If they muſt needs have her in her eſtate of glory, as at <hi>Amiens</hi>; or of honour (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now publikely acknowledged to be the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs among Women) as at <hi>Paris</hi>: let them disburden her of her Child. To clap them thus both together, is a folly equally worthy of ſcorn &amp; laughter. Certainly had ſhe but ſo much liberty as to make choice of her own clothes, I doubt not but ſhe would obſerve a greater <hi>decorum.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I commend the Capouchins of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> who in a little ſide Chappel conſecrated unto her, have placed onely an handſom fair looking-glaſs upon her Altar, the beſt ornament of a Female Cloſet.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54835:18"/>
Why they placed it there I cannot ſay: onely I conceive it was, that ſhe might there ſee how to dreſs her ſelf.</p>
               <p>This Church is ſaid to have been built (I ſhould rather think repaired) by <hi>Raoul</hi> or <hi>Rollo</hi> the firſt Duke of <hi>Normandy:</hi> Since it hath been much beautified by the Engliſh, when they were Lords of this Province. It is the ſeat of an Arch-biſhop, a Dean and fifty Canons. The Arch-biſhoprick was inſtituted by the authority of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, during the ſitting of the Council of <hi>Arles; Anidian</hi> who was there preſent being conſecrated the firſt Arch-biſhop. The Biſhops of Seas, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renches, Conſtances, Beaux, Lyſieaux</hi> and <hi>Eureux,</hi> were appointed for his Dioceſans. The now Arch-biſhop is ſaid to be an able Schollar and a ſound States-man: his name I enquired not. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of his Chair are ſaid to be ten thouſand Crowns. More they would amount to, were the Country any way fruitful of Vines: out of which the other Prelates of <hi>France</hi> draw no ſmall part of their <hi>Intrado.</hi>

               <p>The Parliament of this Country was eſtabliſhed here by <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, who alſo built that fair Palace, wherein Juſtice is adminiſtred, <hi>Anno</hi> 1501. At that time he divided <hi>Normandy</hi> into ſeven <hi>Cathes, Rapes,</hi> or <hi>Baliwicks,</hi> viz. <hi>Roven, Caux, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentin, Caen, Eureux, Giſors,</hi> and <hi>Alenzon,</hi> This Court hath ſupreme power to enquire into, and give ſentence of all cauſes within the limits of <hi>Normandy.</hi> It receiveth appeals from the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Courts of the Dutchy unto it, but admitteth none from it. Here is alſo <hi>Cour des Eſleuz,</hi> a Court
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54835:18"/>
of the general Commiſſioners for taxes: and <hi>la Chambre des aides,</hi> inſtituted by <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh for the receiving of his ſubſidies, <hi>Gabels, Impoſts,</hi> &amp;c. The houſe of Parliament is in form <hi>quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,</hi> a very graceful and delectable building. That of <hi>Paris</hi> is but a <hi>Chaos</hi> or a <hi>Babel</hi> to it. In the great Hall (into which you aſcend by ſome thirty ſteps or upwards) are the ſeats and desks of the <hi>Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,</hi> every ones name being written in Capital letters over his head.

This Court conſiſteth of two Preſidents, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Counſellors or Aſſiſtants, and as many Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates as the Court will admit of, The prime Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident is termed Mr. <hi>De Riz.</hi> by birth a <hi>Norman</hi>: upon the Bench and in all the places of his Court he taketh precedency of the Duke of <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi> When there is a Convention of the

               <p>We ſaid even now, that from the ſentence of this Court there lay no appeal: but this muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted, and it is no ſhame to do it. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath writ his <hi>Retractions</hi>; ſo alſo hath <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> Once in the year there is an appeal admitted; but for one man onely, and that on this occaſion. There was a poyſonous Dragon not far from <hi>Roven,</hi> which had done much harm to the Country and City. Many wayes had been tried to deſtroy him, but none proſpered. At laſt <hi>Roman,</hi> afterwards made a St. then Arch-biſhop of the Town, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a theif and a murderer, whoſe lives had been forfeited to a ſentence, undertaketh the enter priſe. Upon ſight of the Dragon the theif ſtole away, the murderer goeth in and ſeeth that holy man vanquiſh the Serpent, armed onely with a <hi>Stoale</hi> (it is a neck habit ſanctified by his holineſs of <hi>Rome,</hi> and made much after the faſhion of a tippet) with this <hi>Stoale</hi> tyed about the neck of the Dragon doth the murderer lead him priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to <hi>Roven.</hi> To make ſhort work; the Name of God is praiſed, the Biſhop magnified, the murderer pardoned, and the Dragon burned. This accident (if the ſtory be not <hi>Apocrypha</hi>) is ſaid to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on <hi>Holy Thurſday. Audom</hi> or <hi>Owen</hi> ſucceſſor unto St. <hi>Roman,</hi> in memory of this marvellous act, obtained of King <hi>Dagobert</hi> the firſt (he began his raign <hi>Anno</hi> 632.) that from that time forwards the Chapter of the Cathedral Church ſhould on every <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> day have the faculty of delivering any Malefactor whom the Laws had condemned.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54835:19"/>
This that King then granted, and all the following Kings to this time have ſucceſſively confirmed it. I omit the ceremonies and ſolemnities wherewith this Priſoner is taken out of his Irons and reſtored to liberty. It is not above nine years agone, ſince a Baron of <hi>Gaſcoyne</hi> took occaſion to kill his Wife; which done, he fled hither into <hi>Normandy</hi>; and having firſt acquainted the Canons of <hi>Noſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame</hi> with his deſire, put himſelf to the ſentence of the Court, and was adjudged to the <hi>Wheele. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion</hi> day immediately comming on, the Canons challenged him, and the Judge, according to the cuſtom, cauſed him to be delivered. But the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> pleaded, that the benefit of that priviledge belonged onely to the Natives of that Country, and they pleaded with ſuch fury, that the Baron was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain committed to priſon, till the <hi>Queen Mother</hi> had wooed the people, <hi>pro eâ ſaltem vice,</hi> to admit of his repreival.</p>
               <p>I deferred to ſpeak of the language of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> till I came hither, becauſe here it is beſt ſpoken. It differeth from the <hi>Pariſian,</hi> and more elegant French, almoſt as much as the Engliſh ſpoken in the <hi>North</hi> doth from that of <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Oxford.</hi> Some of the old <hi>Norman</hi> words it ſtill retaineth, but not many. It is much altered from what it was in the time of the Conqueror: few of the words in which our Laws were written being known by them. One of our company gave a <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tletons tenures</hi> written in that language to a <hi>French Doctor</hi> in the Laws, who proteſted that in three lines he could not underſtand three words of it.

as it is alſo in moſt places of this <hi>Province.</hi> The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are thought to be as great a party as the other, but far weaker: the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> having diſarmed them in the beginning of the laſt troubles.</p>

We are now preferred, <hi>ab aſinis ad equos,</hi> from the Cart to the Waggon. The <hi>French</hi> call it a <hi>Coach,</hi> but that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not; ſo would they needs have the Cart to be Chariot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe Waggons are ordinary inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of travel in thoſe Countries, much of kin to a <hi>Graves-end Barge:</hi> you ſhall hardly find them without a knave or a <hi>Giglot.</hi> A man may be ſure to be merry in them, were he as certain of being wholeſome. This in which we travelled contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ten perſons, as all of them commonly do: and amongſt theſe ten, one might have found <hi>Engliſh, Scots, French, Normans, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi>; a jolly medley; had our religions been as different as our Nations, I ſhould have thought my ſelf in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54835:20"/>
                  <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> or <hi>Poland.</hi> If a man had deſired to have ſeen a brief or an <hi>Epitome</hi> of the world, he could no where have received ſuch ſatisfaction, as by looking on us. I have already reckoned up the ſeveral nations, I will now lay open the ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. There were then to be found among theſe paſſengers Men and Women, Lords and Serving-men, Schollars and Clowns, Ladies and Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, Prieſts and Lay-men, Gentlemen and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, people of all ſexes, and almoſt of all ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If all the learning in the world were loſt, it might be found in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> ſo ſaid <hi>Budaeus.</hi> If all the Nations in the world had been loſt, they might have been found again in our Waggon, ſo I: Seriouſly I think our Coach to have been no unfit repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Ark, a whole world of men and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages might have grown out of it.</p>
               <p>But all this while our Waggon joggeth on, but ſo leaſureſy, that it gave me leave to take a more patient view of the Country then we could in the Cart. And here indeed I ſaw ſufficient to affect the Country, yea to dote on it; had I not come out of <hi>England.</hi> The fields ſuch as already I have deſcribed: every where beſet with Apple-trees, and fruits of the like nature: you could ſcarce ſee any thing which was barren in the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Theſe Apples are both meat and drink to the poor Peſant, for the Country is ill provided with vines (the onely want I could obſerve in it) and Beer is a good beverage at a Gentlemans table. Sider then or Perry are the poor mans Clarret; and happy man is he, which can once or twice in a week aſpire ſo high above water. To proceed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Through many a miſerable Village (<hi>Duburgs</hi> they call them) and one Town ſomewhat bigger then the reſt, called <hi>Ecquille,</hi> we came that night to St. <hi>Claire,</hi> ten French miles from <hi>Roven.</hi> A poor Town, God wot, and had nothing in it remarkable, but an accident. There dwelt a Monk grown into great opinion for his ſanctity; and one who had an eſpecial hand on ſore eyes: yet his ability here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was not general, none being capable of cure from him, but pure Virgins. I perſwade my ſelf <hi>France</hi> could not yeild him many Patients: and yet from all parts he was much ſought unto. Hope of cure, and a charitable opinion which they had of themſelves, had brought unto him divers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Damſels, which I am confident had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his miracle. In the ſame Inn (Alehouſe I ſhould ſay) where we were to be harboured, there had put in a whole covey of theſe Ladies Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Pilgrims they called themſelves, and had come on foot two dayes journey to clear their eye-ſight. They had white vails hanging down their backs, which in part covered their faces, yet I perceived by a glimpſe, that ſome of them were paſt cure: though my charity durſt allow them Maids<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was afraid to ſuppoſe them Virgins: yet ſo far I dare aſſure them they ſhould recover their ſight, that when they came home they ſhould ſee their folly. At that time, what with too much watching on ſhip-board, what with the tartneſs of the water, and the violence of the wind working upon me almoſt forty hours together whilſt I lay on the hatches mine eyes had gotten a rheum and redneſs. My Hoſteſs (good woman) perſwaded
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54835:21"/>
me to this holy and bleſſed Wight; but I durſt not venture; not that I had not as good a claim to my virginity as the beſt there; but becauſe I had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what a greivous ſentence was denounced on <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ſeeking help of <hi>Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron</hi>: When I hap to be ill, let mine amendment come in God's Name. <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem ſemper profanus eſſe, quám ſic religioſus,</hi> as <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius Felix</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sacrifices: let my body ſtill be troubled with a ſore eye, then have ſuch a recovery be a perpetual eye-ſore to my conſcience. Rather than go on pilgrimage to ſuch a Saint, let the <hi>Papiſts</hi> count me for an Heretick. Beſides, how durſt I imagine in him an ability of curing my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily eyes, who above ſeventy years had been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a blindneſs in the eyes of his ſoul. <hi>Thou Fool</hi> (ſaid our Saviour almoſt in the like caſe) <hi>firſt caſt out the beam of thine own eye, and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to caſt the mote out of thy brothers eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next morning, <hi>Auguſt</hi> the third, I left my Pilgrims to try their fortunes, and went on in our journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> which that day we were to viſit. My eyes not permitting me to read, and mine ears altogether ſtrangers to the French chat, drave my thoughts back to <hi>Roven</hi>; and there nothing ſo much poſſeſſed me, as the ſmall honour done to <hi>Bedford</hi> in his Monument. I had leiſure enough to provide him a longer Epitaph; and a ſhort apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy againſt the envy of that Courtier which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth to deface the ruines of his Sepulcher, Thus:

They are planted like our Hop-gardens, and grow up by the help of Poles, but not ſo high. They are kept with little coſt: and yeild profit to an Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſufficient to make him rich, had he neither King nor Landlord. The Wine which is preſſed out of them is harſh and not pleaſing; as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in ſweetneſs from the Wines of <hi>Paris</hi> or <hi>Orleans,</hi> as their language doth in elegancy. The reſt of the Norman Wines which are not very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, as growing onely on the frontiers towards <hi>France,</hi> are of the ſame quality. As for the Town of <hi>Mante</hi> it ſeemeth to have been of good ſtrength before the uſe of great Ordinance; having a wall, a competent ditch, and at every gate a Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge. They are ſtill ſufficient to guard their pullen from the Fox; and in the night time to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their houſes from forrain burglaries: Once indeed they were able to make reſiſtance to a King of <hi>France,</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were then within it: At laſt on honourable terms it yeilded, and was entred by <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt, Anno</hi> 1449.

For having raiſed his armes upon the Duke of <hi>Yorkes</hi> coming to give him battel with 6000. men onely, the French Army conſiſting of double the number, he retired, or fled rather, unto St. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis.</hi> But there hearing how ſcandalous his retreat was to the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> even ready to mutiny; and that the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and others of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſtirred with the ignominiouſneſs of his flight, began to practiſe againſt him; he ſpeedily return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to <hi>pontoiſe</hi> and maketh himſelf Maſter of it by aſſault.

Upon this none appearance the Peers proceed to ſentence. <hi>Il fur par Arreſt la dire Cour</hi> (ſaith Du' <hi>Cheſne) condemne pour attaint, et convainuc du crime de parricide, &amp; de felonnie</hi>: Parricide for the killing of his own Nephew, and felony for committing an act ſo execrable on the perſon of a French vaſſal and in <hi>France.

                  <hi>the Iſle</hi>; I know not any thing more like it, then the <hi>Iſle of Elie</hi>: the <hi>Eure</hi> on the Weſt, the <hi>Velle</hi> on the Eaſt, the <hi>Oyſe</hi> on the Northward, and a vein riveret of the <hi>Seine</hi> towards the South, are the Rivers which encircle it. But the principall environings are made by the <hi>Seine,</hi> and the <hi>Marne,</hi> a river of <hi>Champagne,</hi> which within the main <hi>Iſland,</hi> make divers <hi>Ilets:</hi> the waters winding up and down, as deſirous to recreate the earth, with the pleaſures of its love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and delicious embraces.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Iſle,</hi> this portion of <hi>Gaule</hi> properly and limitedly ſtiled <hi>France,</hi> was the ſeate of the <hi>Franks,</hi> at their firſt coming hither; and hath ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo.

But it is the cuſtome (ſhall I ſay) or fate of leſſer and weaker Nations, to looſe their names unto the ſtronger; as Wives do to their Husbands: and the ſmaller Rivers to the greater. Thus we ſee the little Province of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to have maſtered, and given name to the <hi>Pruteni, Marovy,</hi> and other Nations of <hi>Sarmatia, Europaea</hi>: as that of <hi>Moſeo</hi> hath unto all the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> of <hi>Aſiatica.</hi> Thus hath <hi>Sweden</hi> conquered and denominated almoſt all the great <hi>Peninſula</hi> of <hi>Scandia,</hi> where it is but a little parcell: and thus did the <hi>Engliſh Saxon,</hi> being the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of the reſt, impoſe the name of <hi>Engliſh</hi> on all the people of the <hi>Heptarchy.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>French</hi> then are poſſeſſors of ſome part of <hi>old Gallia,</hi> and maſters of the reſt; poſſeſſors not of their Cities onely, but their conditions; a double victory it ſeemeth they enjoyed over that people: and took from them at once, both their Qualities and their Countries.

If we dive into Natural cauſes, we have a ſpeedy recourſe unto the powerfull influence of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; for as thoſe celeſtial bodies conſidered in the general, do work upon all ſublunary bodies in the general, by light, influence, and motion: ſo have they a particular operation on particulars: an operation there is wrought by them in a man, as born at ſuch and ſuch a minute; and again, as born under ſuch and ſuch a climate: the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the ſetting of the houſes, and the Lord of the <hi>Horoſcope</hi> at the time of his nativity: the other from that Conſtellation which govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as it were the Province of his birth; and is the <hi>Genius</hi> or <hi>Deus tutelaris loci.

Out of this conceit of his own excellencie, and partly out of a ſhallowneſs of brain, he is very lyable to exceptions; the leaſt diſtaſte that can be, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſword, and a minutes pauſe ſheatheth it to your hand: afterwards if you beat him into better manners, he ſhall take it kindly, and cry <hi>Serviteur.</hi> In this one thing they are wonderfully like the Devil; meekneſs or ſubmiſſion makes them inſolent, a little reſiſtance putteth them to their heeles, or makes them your <hi>Spaniels.</hi> In a word (for I have held him too long) he is a wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanitie in a new faſhion.</p>

new ſerved from the Hatch. A Loyne of Mutton ſerves amongſt them for three roſtings, beſides the hazard of making pottage with the rump. Fowl alſo they have in good plenty; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſuch as the King found in <hi>Scotland:</hi> to ſay truth, that which they have, is ſufficient for nature and a friend, were it not for the Miſtriſs, or the Kitchin wench. I have heard much fame of the <hi>french</hi> Cookes, but their skill lyeth not in the neat handling of Beef or Mutton. They (have as generally have all this Nation) good fancies, and are ſpeciall fellowes for the making of puff paſtes, and the ordering of banquets. Their trade is not to feed the belly, but the pallat. It is now time you were ſet down, where the firſt thing you muſt do, is to ſay your own Grace; private Graces are as ordinary there, as private Maſſes, and from thence I think they learned them. That done, fall to where you like beſt; they obſerve no method in their eating, and if you look for a carver, you may riſe faſting. When you are riſen, if you can digeſt the ſluttiſhneſs of the Cookery, (which is moſt abominable at firſt ſight) I dare truſt you in a Garriſon; follow him to Church and there he will ſhew himſelf moſt irrereligious and irreverent: I ſpeak not of all but the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.

It expreſſeth very much of it ſelf in the action: the head, body and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders concurre all in the pronouncing of it; and he that hopeth to ſpeak it with a good grace, muſt have ſomething in him of the <hi>Mimick.</hi> It is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with a full number of ſignificant Proverbs, which is a great help to the <hi>French</hi> humor in ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, and very full of Courtſhip, which maketh all the people complemental; the pooreſt Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in the village hath his Court cringes, and his <hi>eau bemſte de Cour,</hi> his Court holy water as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>

Vicinae autem gentes ridiculo errore deceptae, eiusdem Venuſtatis imitationem ludieram faciunt et ingratam</hi>: as one happily obſerved at his being amongſt them. I have heard of a young Gallant Sonne to a great Lord of one of the three Brittiſh Kingdomes, that ſpent ſome years in <hi>France</hi> to learn faſhions; at his return he deſired to ſee the King, and his Father
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54835:29"/>
procured him an enterveiwe; when he came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the preſence Chamber, he began to compoſe his head, and carryed it, as though he had been ridden with a Martingale; next he fell to draw back his leggs, and thruſt out his ſhoulders, and that with ſuch a graceleſs apiſhneſs, that the King asked him, if he meant to ſhoulder him out of his Chair, and ſo left him to act out his complement to the hangings. In their Courtſhip they beſtow e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the higheſt titles upon thoſe of the loweſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. This is the vice alſo of their common talk, the begger begitteth <hi>Monſieurs</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dames</hi> to his Sonnes and Daughters, as familiarly as the King: were there no other reaſon to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me, that the <hi>Welch</hi> or <hi>Brittaynes</hi> were the defendants of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> this onely were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that they would all be Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>His diſcourſe runneth commonly on two wheeles, <hi>Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Ribaldry</hi>; I never heard people talk leſs reverently of their Prince, nor more ſawcily of his actions; ſcarce a day paſſeth away, without ſome ſeditious pamphlet printed and publiſhed in the diſgrace of the King, or of ſome of his Courtires. Theſe are every mans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and he that buyeth them is not coye of the Contents, be they never ſo ſcandalous: of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors the moſt harſh and odious. Take him from this (which you can hardly do till he hath told all) and then he falleth upon his ribaldry; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe crutches, his diſcourſe would never be able to keep pace with his company. Thus ſhall you have them relate the ſtories of their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, with a face as confident, as if they

had no accident to pleaſe their hearers more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendible. Thus will they reckon up the ſeveral profanations of pleaſure, by which they have <hi>diſmanned themſelves</hi>; ſometimes not ſparing to deſcend unto particulars.

could not but amaze me, that they who in their actions were ſo light and wanton, ſhould yet think themſelves modeſt; and confine all laſciviouſneſs unto a kiſs.

it a juſt judgement of God upon our Nation, that all the married men ſhould thus ſuffer. <hi>A ſtrange peice of Divinity to me,</hi> that never before heard ſuch preaching. This was the occaſion of the doctrine. In the old English <hi>Maſs-book,</hi> called <hi>Secundum uſum Sarum,</hi> the Woman at the time of marriage promiſeth her future Husband to be bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and buxome at bed and at board till death us depart, &amp;c. This being too light for the gravity of the action then in hand; and in mine opinion ſomewhat leſs reverent than a Church duty would require; the Reformers of that Book thought good to alter, and thought fitter to <hi>put in, to love, cheriſh and obey.</hi> That this was a ſufficient aſſurance of Conjugal faith he would not grant, becauſe the promiſe of being buxome in bed was excluded. Beſides, he accounted the ſuppoſed diſhoneſty of the Engliſh Wives as a vengeance plucked down on the heads of the people, for chopping and changing the words of the holy Sacrament (for ſuch they eſteem the form of Matrimony.) Though his argument needed no anſwer; yet his accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might expect one. And an Engliſh Gentleman (though not of the Engliſh faith) laid open the abuſe, and ſeemed to ſpeak it out of knowledge. When the <hi>Monſieurs</hi> came over full purſed to <hi>London,</hi> the French Pandars, which lay in wait for ſuch booties, grow into their acquaintance, and promiſe them the imbraces of ſuch a Dame of the City, or of ſuch a Lady of the Court; Women per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps famed for admirable beauties.

If Nature were ever prodigal of her bleſſings, or ſcattered them with an over-plentiful hand, it was in this Iſland into which we were entred as ſoon as we were paſſed over the bridge of <hi>Pontoiſe.</hi> The firſt part of it, laſting for three leagues, was upon the plain of a Mountain, but ſuch a Mountain as will hardly yeild to the beſt Valley in <hi>Europe</hi> out of <hi>France.</hi> On both ſides of us the Vines grew up in a juſt length, and promiſed to the Husband-man a thriving vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The Wines they yeild are far better than thoſe of <hi>Normandy</hi> or <hi>Gaſcoyne,</hi> and indeed the beſt in the whole Continent, thoſe of <hi>Orleans</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; yet what we ſaw here was but as a bit to prepare our ſtomacks, leaſt we ſhould ſurfeit in the Valley.</p>
               <p>Here we beheld Nature in her richeſt veſtments. The fields enterchangeably planted with Wheat and Vines: That had <hi>L. Florus</hi> once beheld it, he would never have given unto <hi>Campania</hi> the title of <hi>Cereris &amp; Bacchi certamen.</hi> Theſe fields were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſedly here and there beſet with Cherry-trees: which conſidered with the reſt gave unto the eye an excellent object. For the Vines yet green, the Wheat ready for the ſithe, and the Cherries now full ripened, and ſhewing forth their beauty through the vail of the leaves, made ſuch a various and delightſome mixture of colours, that no art
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54835:37"/>
could have expreſſed it ſelf more delectable. If you have ever ſeen an exquiſite Moſaical work you may beſt judge of the beauty of this Valley. Add to this that the River <hi>Seine</hi> being now paſt <hi>Paris,</hi> either to embrace that flouriſhing ſoyl, or out of a wanton deſire to play with it ſelf, hath divided it ſelf into ſundry leſſer channels, beſides its ſeveral windings and turnings: So that one may very juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not irreligiouſly conceive it to be an <hi>Idaea</hi> or <hi>repreſentation of the Garden of Eden</hi>; the River ſo happily ſeparating it ſelf to water the ground. This Valley is a very large circuit. And as the Welch-men call <hi>Angleſea Mon Mam Gymry,</hi> that is, <hi>the Mother of Wales</hi>: ſo may we call this the <hi>Mother of Paris:</hi> for ſo abundantly doth it furniſh that great and populous City, that when the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Bary</hi> and <hi>Burgundie</hi> beſieged it with 100000. men, there being at that time three or 400000. Citizens and Souldiers within the wals, neither the people within, nor the enemy without, found any want of proviſion.</p>
               <p>It is called the Valley of <hi>Montmorencie,</hi> from the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Montmorencie</hi> ſeated in it. But this Town nameth not the Valley onely; it giveth name alſo to the ancient family of the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Montmorencie,</hi> the <hi>ancienteſt houſe of Chriſtendom.</hi> He ſtiled himſelf <hi>Lepremier Chriſtien, &amp; plus vicil Baron du' France,</hi> and it is ſaid, that his Anceſtors received the faith of Chriſt by the preaching of St. <hi>Denis</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Paris.</hi> Their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal houſes are that of <hi>Chantilly</hi> and <hi>Ecqucan,</hi> both ſeated in the Iſle: This laſt being given to this preſent Dukes Father by King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54835:37"/>
whom it was confiſcated by the condemnation of one of his Treaſurers. This houſe alſo (and ſo I beleive it) hath been obſerved to have yeilded to <hi>France</hi> more <hi>Conſtables, Marſhals, Admirals,</hi> and the like Officers of power and command than any three other in the whole Kingdom, inſomuch that I may ſay of it, what <hi>Irenicus</hi> doth of the <hi>Count Palatines,</hi> the names of the Countries onely chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: <hi>Non alia Galliae eſt familia cui plus debent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitus.</hi> The now Duke named <hi>Henry,</hi> is at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Admiral</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt eminent place in all the Iſle is <hi>Mont-Martyr,</hi> eminent I mean by reaſon of its height; though it hath alſo enough of antiquity to make it remarkable. It is ſeated within a mile of <hi>Paris,</hi> high upon a Mountain, on which many of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, during the time that <hi>Gaule</hi> was heatheniſh, were made <hi>Martyrs</hi>: Hence the name; though <hi>Paris</hi> was the place of apprehenſion and ſentence, yet was this Mountain commonly the Scaffold of execution: It being the cuſtom of the Ancients, <hi>neither to put to death, nor bury within the wals of their Cities.</hi> Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> when they crucified our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, led him out of the City of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> unto Mount <hi>Calvary</hi>: unto which St. <hi>Paul</hi> is thought to allude, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. ſaying, <hi>Let us therefore go forth to him,</hi> &amp;c. Thus alſo doth St. <hi>Luke</hi> (to omit other inſtances) report of St. <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 7. <hi>And they caſt him out of the City and ſtoned him.</hi> So in the State of <hi>Rome</hi>; the <hi>Veſtal Virgin</hi> having committed fornication was ſtifled in the <hi>Campus Sceleritatus</hi>; and other Malefactors thrown down the <hi>Tarpeian rock</hi>; both ſcituate without the Town.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54835:38"/>
So alſo had the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> a place of execution from the praecipice of an hill, which they called the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, <hi>be hanged.</hi> As they permitted not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Malefactors within their wals: ſo neither would they ſuffer the beſt of their Citizens to be buried within them. This was it which made <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> to buy him <hi>a field wherein to bury his dead</hi>: and thus we read in the ſeventh of <hi>Luke,</hi> that the Widow of <hi>Naims</hi> Son was carried out to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This cuſtom alſo we find among the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Corinthians</hi> and other of the <hi>Graecians; qui inagris ſuis</hi> (ſaith <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro) aut in fundo ſuburbano, ceuinavito aut patrio ſolo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora humari conſuevere.</hi> Amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> it was once the faſhion to burn the bodies of their dead within their City. This continued till the bringing in of the <hi>Laws of Athens,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Laws of the twelve Tables</hi>: one of which Laws runneth in theſe words. <hi>In urbe ne ſepelito, neve drito.</hi> After this prohibition their dead corps were firſt <hi>burned in Campus Martius</hi>; and their Urnes covered in ſundry places of the field. The frequent Urnes or ſepulchral ſtones digged up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us here in <hi>England</hi> are ſufficient teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of this aſſertion. Beſides we may find in <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian,</hi> that the chief reaſon why the rich men in <hi>Rome</hi> would not yeild to the Law called <hi>Lex A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grariae</hi> (for that Law divided the Roman poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons equally among the people) was, becauſe they thought it an irreligious thing, that the Monuments of their fore-fathers ſhould be ſold to others. The firſt that is regiſtred to have been buried in the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54835:38"/>
City was <hi>Trajane</hi> the Emperor. Afterward it was granted as an honorary to ſuch as had deſerved well of the Republique. And when the Chriſtian Religion prevailed; and Church-yards, thoſe dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitories of the Saints were conſecrated, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of burying within the wals was to all equally granted.</p>
               <p>On this ground it not being lawful to put to death or bury within the Town of <hi>Paris</hi>; this Mountain was deſtinate to theſe purpoſes: then was it onely a Mountain, now it is enlarged unto a Town. It hath a poor wall, an <hi>Abbey</hi> of <hi>Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctine Monks,</hi> and a Chappel called <hi>La Chapelle des Martyrs:</hi> both founded by <hi>Lewis</hi> the ſixth, called <hi>The Groſs.</hi> Amongſt others which received here the Crown of Martyrdom, none more famous than St. <hi>Denis</hi> (ſaid to be <hi>Dioniſius Areopagita</hi>) the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Paris: Ruſticus</hi> his Arch-preiſt, and <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his Deacon. The time when, under the raign of <hi>Domitian</hi>: the perſon by whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Heſubinus</hi> Governour of <hi>Paris</hi>; the crime; for not bowing before the Altar of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and offering ſacrifice unto him. Of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> being the <hi>Patron</hi> or <hi>Tutelary St. of France,</hi> the <hi>Legend</hi> reports ſtrange wonders, as namely, when the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner had ſmitten off his head, he caught it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his arms, and ran with it down the hill, as faſt as his legs could bear him. Half a mile from the place of his execution he ſate down, reſted, and ſo he did nine times in all, even till he came to the place where his Church is now built. There he fell down and died, being <hi>three milee Engliſh from Mount Martyr</hi>; and there he was buried together
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54835:39"/>
with <hi>Ruſticus</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius</hi>: who not being able to go as faſt as he did, were brought after by the people. <hi>O impudentiam admirabilem &amp; verè Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manam!</hi> and yet ſo far was the ſucceeding age poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a beleif of this miracle, that in the nine ſeveral places, where he is ſaid to have reſted, ſo many handſom croſſes of ſtones there are erected: all of a making.</p>
               <p>To the memory of this St. did <hi>Dagobert</hi> the firſt build a Temple, and the times enſuing improved it to a Town. Afterwards in honour of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and becauſe it lay near <hi>Paris,</hi> ſome of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kings beſtowed a wall upon it. A wall it is of a large circuit, and very much unproportionable to the Town which ſtandeth in it; for all the world <hi>like a Spaniards little face in his great ruffe</hi>: or like a ſmall chop of Mutton in a large diſh of Pottage (at the three-penny ordinary.) Thus was the Town (as you ſee) built by means, but it was not ſo with the Temple: unleſs that be worth a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in the building and in the conſecrating of it, I will not give a ſtraw for it. Thus then ſaith the ſtory: <hi>Dagobert</hi> afterwards King of <hi>France,</hi> during the life of <hi>Clotarre</hi> the ſecond his Father, had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly ſlain <hi>Sadraſagille</hi> his Governor. To avoid the fury of his Father, much incenſed with that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>princely action, he was compelled to wander up and down <hi>France,</hi> hungry and thirſty: And as he went, and he went (for this tale ſhould be told in the ſame ſtile that Wenches tell theirs by the fires ſide) till he came to the <hi>Sepulcher of St. Denis</hi>; where he laid himſelf down and ſlept: and then there appeared unto him a fine old man, with a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54835:39"/>
ſtaffe in his hand, and he told him, that his Father was dead; and that he ſhould be King: and he prayed him of all loves, that when he came to be King, he would build a <hi>Church</hi> there, <hi>to the honour of St. Denis.</hi> He had an hard heart, that could deny ſo ſweet an old man ſo little a curteſie for ſo much good news: and I trow he was more kind than ſo. And ſo when the Church was built, the Biſhop was ſent for in all haſt to bleſs it. But it chanced the night before the day wherein the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was to bleſs it, there came to the Town an ugly Leper, and the fouleſt that ever was ſeen. And this Leper would needs lie in the Church: and when he was there, about twelve a clock in the night our <hi>Saviour</hi> came to the Church in garments as white as the driven ſnow. There came with him the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the <hi>Angels,</hi> and the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and the ſweeteſt muſick that ever was heard in the world. Then <hi>Chriſt bleſſed the Church</hi>; and ſaid unto the Leper, that he ſhould tell the Biſhop that the Church was already bleſſed: and for a token of it, he gave the Leper his health: who preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as fine a ſweet youth as one ſhould ſee in a ſummers day. <hi>Auditam admiſſe riſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But (to omit the additions of the Legend) true it is, that <hi>Dagobert</hi> was the <hi>firſt Founder</hi> of the Church: which was afterward rebuilt and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the twenty fifth Abbot of it, called <hi>Sugger,</hi> in the raign of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the ſixth. A reverent and comely Fabrick certainly it is: Dark, as the Churches of thoſe times commonly were, and none of the pooreſt. It maintaineth ſixty two <hi>Monks</hi> and an <hi>Abbot,</hi> whoſe ſingle revenue is thought to be <hi>worth ten thouſand Crowns</hi> and upward. The preſent Abbot is <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> Son to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> a young Gentleman of ſome four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of age, or thereabouts: but of him more hereafter. The Abbot of it, among many other priviledges, hath a full power upon the lives, goods, and honours of his vaſſals; and hath a voice in the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> as full and binding as any of the Counſellors there ſitting. As for the Church it ſelf, it is in height eighty foot, an hundred in breadth, and in length three hundred. The <hi>high Altar,</hi> under which the bodies of Saint <hi>Denis</hi> and his two fellow Martyrs are ſaid to be buried, is a very rich and excellent work: the <hi>Crucifix</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over it being all of pure gold, embos'd with divers pearls and pretious ſtones of great value. Before it hangeth a ſilver Lamp continually burning; and if you look about it, you ſhall ſee the richeſt and the faireſt glaſs for painting in all <hi>France,</hi> that of <hi>Amiens</hi> onely excepted; one thing I will further note in this Church, before I come to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54835:40"/>
the Tombs and Reliques; which is, how <hi>Henry the fourth in this Church ſaid his firſt Maſs</hi> after his laſt reconcilement to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: and good reaſon I have to ſay his laſt: For having firſt been brought up in the Romiſh faith; he was by his Mother made a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> At the Maſſacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> fear of death or impriſonment turned him <hi>Papiſt.</hi> Liberty made him again an <hi>Hugonot.</hi> In this he continued till the year 1595. And then once more <hi>re-emboſom'd himſelf in the Roman Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue,</hi> which was the time we now ſpeak of. <hi>Quo teneam nodo mutantem protea vultum</hi>? the onely <hi>Proteus</hi> in matters of faith of our times, Doctor <hi>Perne,</hi> was a diamond to him.</p>
               <p>It is now time I ſhould ſhew you the <hi>Reliques</hi>: but you muſt firſt ſtay till the Clerk hath put on his Surplice. I have heard of a blind Prieſt, that could never mumble over his Maſs without his ſpectacles: this <hi>fellow and his Surplice</hi> is juſt like him. I perſwade my ſelf, that the Surplice without the Clark could marſhal the Reliques, as well as the Clark without the Surplice. As ſoon as he was ſadled for his journey, he put himſelf into his way, and followed it with a pace ſo nimbly, that there was no keeping of him company. His tongue ran ſo faſt, that the quickeſt eye there was fain to give him over in plain ground: the fellow that ſheweth the <hi>Tombs</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> being no more to be compared to him for the volubility of his chops, than a <hi>Capouchin</hi> to a <hi>Jeſuite</hi>: yet as we learned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards of him, when he was out of his road, they were thus diſpoſed. On the right hand of the Altar (not that high Altar above mentioned) there are
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54835:41"/>
ſaid to be kept one of the <hi>nails</hi> which faſtened our Saviour to the Croſs. Secondly, a <hi>peice of the Croſs</hi> it ſelf. Thirdly, ſome of the <hi>Virgin Maries Milk.</hi> Fourthly, the <hi>arm of St. Simeon</hi> ſet in a caſe of gold. And fiftly, the <hi>Reliques of St. Lewis</hi> reſerved in a little Chappel, all of gold alſo, and built after the faſhion of <hi>Noſtre-dame</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi> On the left there was ſhewed us the <hi>head of St. Denis,</hi> and a part of his body: But I miſtake my ſelf, it was not the head, but the Portraiture in gold; the head being ſaid to be within it. By this repreſentation he ſeemeth to have had a very reverend and awful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; though I perſwade my ſelf, that the rich Crown Miter which he there weareth (and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they are of an high value) never belonged to him in his life. On each ſide of the head are two Angels ſupporting it, reported to be the work of one <hi>Ely Le plus artiſte orfeure de ſon temps</hi>: the cunningſt Gold-ſmith of his time, who afterwards was made Biſhop of <hi>Noyon</hi> and Sainted.</p>
               <p>Concerning Reliques I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak further, when I come to the <hi>holy Chappel in Paris</hi>: ſomewhat now of the honour due unto the memory of Martyrs. I am none of thoſe that think the memories of thoſe Heroes of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times not to be honoured in the duſt. Neither would I aſſault their ſhrines with an irreverent fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. On the other ſide, they ſhall never have my prayers directed to them, nor my devotions: nor can I think it lawful to give the remnants of them any bodily obſervance: though I do and will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yet I dare not worſhip them. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath cut out the mid-way between the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54835:41"/>
the <hi>Zelots,</hi> in the eighth book of his moſt excellent work <hi>de Civitate Dei,</hi> and his path it is beſt to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: <hi>Honoramus ſane memorias eorum, tanquam Sanctorum hominum Dei, qui uſque ad mortem ſuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum corporum pro veritate certarunt.</hi> And a little after, he ſheweth the end of theſe memorials: <hi>viz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ea celebritate Deo vero gratias de eorum victoriis agamus, &amp; nos ad imitationem talium coronarum eorum memoriae revocatione adhortemur.</hi> One Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique there is, of which this uſe cannot poſſibly be made, and what do you think that ſhould be, but the <hi>Lanthorn</hi> which <hi>Judas</hi> uſed when he went to apprehend his Maſter. A pretty one I confeſs, it is richly beſet with ſtuds of Chriſtal, through which all the light cometh, the main of it being of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance not tranſparent. Had it been ſhewed me within the firſt Century of years after the Paſſion, I might have perhaps been fooled into a beleif, for I am confident it can be no elder. Being as it is, I will acknowledge it to be a Lanthorn, though it belonged not to <hi>Judas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the <hi>Reliques of Martyrs,</hi> proceed we to thoſe of <hi>Kings,</hi> and amongſt thoſe there is nothing which will long detain an Engliſh man. He that hath ſeen the <hi>Tombs</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> will think thoſe to be but trifles: if he conſider the workmanſhip, or the riches and the magnificence. The cheif of thoſe mean ones which are there, are thoſe of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Katherine de Medices</hi> his Wife, in a little Chappel of her own building, both in their full proportion, and in their royal habiliments exceeding ſtately. Here is alſo a neat <hi>Tomb</hi> of the ſame <hi>Henry built all of braſs,</hi> and ſupported by four
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54835:42"/>
braſs pillars. His ſtatue of the ſame mettal placed on the top of it, and compoſed as if at his prayers. The reſt are more in tale than weight: but the chiefeſt beauties of the Church are in the <hi>Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> which was not mine happineſs to ſee. As I am imformed, the moſt remarkable things in it are theſe. The <hi>Swords</hi> of <hi>Joan</hi> the Virgin, <hi>Charles</hi> the great, <hi>Rowland</hi> his Cozen, and that of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth when he was crowned. His Boots, Crowns and Scepters, as thoſe of his Son now raigning. A <hi>Croſs</hi> of three foot high made of pure gold: A Crown, Scepter and golden Ball given by <hi>Pope Adrian</hi> to <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi>: A golden Crown of a larger ſize be decked with adamants and other pretious ſtones, given by <hi>Charles Martell</hi> after his victory over the <hi>Saracens</hi>: A very fair <hi>Chalice</hi> all of gold, in which St. <hi>Denis</hi> is ſaid to have conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated the Sacramental Wine. The others of leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer note I purpoſely omit: for having not ſeen them, I am loath to go any further upon truſt. And ſo I leave St. <hi>Denis,</hi> a Church ſo richly furniſhed, that had I ſeen all the rarities and glory of it, that onely dayes content had deſerved our journey; <hi>Sed haec infaelici nimia,</hi>

A fine contrived houſe it ſeemed to be; but our journey lay beyond it: One league beyond it lay <hi>Ruall,</hi> a ſmall Town belonging to the Abbey of St. <hi>Denis.</hi> In the corner of this Town, the <hi>Queen Mother</hi> hath a fine ſummer houſe, abundantly adorned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired walks, and a moſt curious variety of Water-works: For beſides the forms of divers glaſſes, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and geometrical figures, all framed by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there were birds of ſundry forts ſo artificially made, that they both deceived the eye by their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the ear by their melody: Somewhat higher, in the midſt of a moſt delicious garden, are two <hi>Fountains</hi> of admirable workmanſhip. In the firſt the Portraitures of <hi>Cerberus,</hi> the <hi>Bore</hi> of <hi>Calidon,</hi> the <hi>Naemean Lyon,</hi> and in the navel of it <hi>Hercules</hi> killing <hi>Hydra.</hi> In the other onely a <hi>Crocodile</hi> full of wild and unruly tricks, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his throat a muſick not far different from Organs. Had your eyes been ſhut, you would have thought your ſelf in ſome Cathedral Church: this melody of the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> and that other of the Birds, ſo exactly counterfeiting the harmony of a well ordered Quire. And now we are come into the <hi>Grove,</hi> a place ſo full of retired walks, ſo ſweetly and delectably contrived, that they would even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice a man to melancholy; becauſe in them even melancholy would ſeem delightful. The trees ſo interchangeably folded the one within the other, that they were at once a ſhelter againſt wind and ſun, yet not not ſo ſullenly cloſe, but that they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded the eye an excellent Lordſhip over the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54835:43"/>
vines, and verdures of the earth impriſoned within them. It ſeemed a Grove, an Orchard, and a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, ſo variouſly enterwoven and mixed together, as if it had been the purpoſe of the Artiſt to make a man fall in love with confuſion. In the middle of the wilderneſs was ſeated the <hi>houſe,</hi> environed round about with a moat of running water; the houſe pretty and therefore little, built rather for a banquet than a feaſt. It was built and thus enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with variety of pleaſures by <hi>Mr. de Ponte</hi> Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor to King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and was, no queſtion, the beſt garment he ever cut out in his life. Dying he gave it to <hi>Mr. Landerbone,</hi> once his ſervant, and now his Son by adoption, of whom the <hi>Queen Mother,</hi> taking a liking to it, bought it, giving in exchange an Office in the Treaſury worth 400000 Crowns to be ſold.</p>
               <p>Two leagues from <hi>Ruall</hi> is the Kings houſe of St. <hi>Germanenly,</hi> an houſe ſeated on the top of an hill, juſt like <hi>Windſore.</hi> The Town of St. <hi>Germain</hi> lyeth all round about it: the River <hi>Reine</hi> (of the ſame breadth as the <hi>Thames</hi> is at the place mentioned) runneth below it; and the houſe, by reaſon of the ſcite, having a large command of the Country round about it. The Town is poor, and hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it remarkable but the name, which it took from St. <hi>Germain</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> who toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with St. <hi>Lupus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Troyes</hi> ſailed into <hi>Britain</hi> to root out <hi>Pelagianiſme.</hi> The Caſtle or Seat royal is divided into two parts, the old &amp; the new. The old, which is next unto the Town, is built of brick and for form it is triangular. Founded it was at the firſt by <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, ſince ſtrengthened
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54835:43"/>
and beautified by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when it was in their poſſeſſion. <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt added to it the upper ſtory, and the battlements, and <hi>in memoriam facti</hi> hath left a <hi>Capital F.</hi> upon every of the chimneys. The new houſe diſtant from the old about a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and to Which you deſcend by a handſome green Court. It was built by <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. It conſiſts of three ſeveral parts all joyned together, the two outermoſt quadrangular; that in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle almoſt round, and in the faſhion of a Jewiſh Synagogue. Here we ſaw the <hi>Volatory</hi> full of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry forrein Birds, and in one of the loweſt rooms great ſtore of out-landiſh Coins, but theſe were but acceſſories. The principal was the majeſty of the houſe, which is indeed worth the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Palace of the <hi>Lou're</hi> ſo much famed, is not to be named the ſame day with that. The rooms are well ordered and well roofed: gorgeouſly ſet out with the curioſity of the Painter. In ſome of the Chambers they ſhewed us ſome poetical ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, expreſſed by the pencil in the windows, and on the wainſcot, and ſeemed to glory much in them. I confeſs they might plentifully have poſſeſſed my fancy, had I not ſeen the Window in <hi>Gorrambury</hi> gallery, belonging to the right Honorable <hi>Francis Viſcount St. Albons,</hi> a Window, in which all the <hi>Fables</hi> of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> are ſo naturally and lively reſembled, that if ever Art went beyond it ſelf, it was in that admirable expreſſion.</p>
               <p>Let us now take a veiw of the <hi>Water-works,</hi> and here we ſhall ſee in the firſt Water-houſe (which is a ſtately large walk, vaulted over head) the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of a <hi>Dragon</hi> juſt againſt the entrance. An
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54835:44"/>
unquiet Beaſt, that vomiteth on all that come nigh it. At the end toward the right hand is the ſtatue of a <hi>Nymph</hi> ſitting before a pair of Organs. Upon the looſing of one of the pipes the Nymphs fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers began to manage the keys, and brought the inſtrument to yeild ſuch a muſick, that if it were not that of an Organ, it was like it as could be, and not be the ſame: Unto the diviſion of her fingers her head kept a proportionable time, jolting from one ſhoulder to the other: as I have ſeen an old Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler at a Wake. In the ſame partition were the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits of all ſorts of mils, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> before very eagerly diſcharged their functions, but upon the beginning of the harmony they ſuddenly ſtood ſtill, as if they had ears to have heard it. At the other end toward the left hand we ſaw a ſhop of Smiths, another of Joyners, and backſides full of Sawyers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, all idle: upon the firſt command of the water they all fell to their occupations, and plied them luſtily: the Birds every where by their ſinging ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Artificers the labour of whiſtling. Beſides upon the drawing of a wooden curtain, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto us two <hi>Tritons</hi> riding on their Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins, and each of them with a ſhell in his hand, which interchangeably and in turns ſerved them in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of Trumpets. A very happy <hi>decorum,</hi> and truly poetical.

Thirty ſix ſteps from the front of the houſe we deſcended into this Water-houſe, and by ſixty more deſcended into a ſecond of the ſame faſhion, but not of an equal length with the other. At the right hand of this, is the whole ſtory of <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Andromeda,</hi> and the whole lively acted: the Whale being killed and the Lady looſed from the rock very perfectly.

Livers. Upon the opening of a double leafed door, there were exhibited unto us divers repreſentations and conceits: which certainly might have been more graceful, if they had not had ſo much in them of a Pudpet-play. By ſome thirty ſteps more we deſcended into the Garden; and by as many more into a Green, which opened into

the water ſides: In which the goodlieſt Flower and moſt pleaſing to mine eye, was the ſtatue of an Horſe in braſs, of that bigneſs, that I and one of my companions could ſtand on the neck of him; but diſmounting from this Horſe we mounted our own, and ſo took our leaves of Saint <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the other ſide of <hi>Paris</hi> and up the River, we ſaw another of the Kings Houſes called Saint <hi>Vincent,</hi> or <hi>Vincennes.</hi> It was beautified with a large Park by <hi>Philip Auguſtus, An.</hi> 1185. who alſo wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Park and repleniſhed it with Deer.

               <p>WE are now come to <hi>Paris,</hi> whether indeed I ſhould have brought you the ſame day we came from <hi>Pontoiſe.</hi> It hath had in ſeveral ages two ſeveral names; the one taken from the people, the other from the ſcituation.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbem paciſiorum: Amianus Marcellinus</hi> calleth it by the ſame name appellative: for as yet the name of <hi>Paris</hi> was not appropriated to it.

The names of great Cities are obſcure, as thoſe of their Founders: and the conjecturall derivations of them are oftentimes rather plauſible than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſometimes neither.

                  </q>
As for the Etymology of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who derived the name from <hi>Paris</hi> one of the Kings of <hi>Celtae,</hi> it may (for ought that I know) deſervedly keep company with that of <hi>Beroſus</hi> already recited. This name of <hi>Lutetia</hi> continued till the coming of the <hi>Franks</hi> into theſe parts, who to endear the Nation of the <hi>Pariſii,</hi> and oblige them more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to do them ſervice, commanded it for ever after to be called <hi>Paris.</hi> But the ſcituation of the Town gave it not onely the name, it gave it alſo (as the cuſtom of Godfathers is in <hi>England</hi>) a Chriſtening gift, which is the riches of it, and by conſequence the preeminence. In how delicate and flouriſhing a ſoyl it is ſcituate, I have already told you in my deſcription of the valley of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morencie</hi> wherein it ſtandeth.

and fruitfulleſt Country. The River of <hi>Seine</hi> is alſo no queſtion a great help to the enriching of it: though it be not navigable to the Town; yet it giveth free paſſage unto Boats of an indifferent bigg burden; into which the Ships are unladen, and ſo their commodities carryed up the water: A profitable entercourſe between the Sea and the City for the <hi>Merchants.</hi> Of theſe Boats there are an infinite company, which ply up and down the water, and more indeed (as the ſaid <hi>Comin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> is of opinion) than any man can beleeve, that hath not ſeen them.</p>
               <p>It is in circuit (as <hi>Boterus</hi> is of opinion) twelve miles; others judge it at ten: for my part I dare not gueſſe it to be above eight, and yet I am told by a <hi>French man</hi> that it was in compaſſe no leſs than fourteen Leagues within the Walls: an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth bigger than the Towne. For figure it is <hi>circular</hi>; that being (according to the <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians</hi>) of all figures the moſt capacious. And queſtionleſs if it be true that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbs non in maenibus ſed in civibus poſita eſt, Paris</hi> may chalenge as great a circuit, as the moſt of <hi>Europe</hi>; it being little inferiour to the biggeſt for the multitude of her inhabitants.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n Pàis,</hi> that it was a whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54835:47"/>
the <hi>Emperour</hi> did well to flatter <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, who asked him theſe queſtions, and in whoſe power he then was: otherwiſe he might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven men good cauſe to ſuſpect his judgement. The truth is that <hi>Paris</hi> is a fayr and goodly Town, yet withal it is no thing like the miracle that ſome make it. Were the figure of <hi>London</hi> altered, and all the houſes of it caſt into a ring, I dare able it a <hi>larger and more goodly Town than Paris,</hi> and that in the compariſon, it may give it at the leaſt half a mile oddes.</p>
               <p>For matter of ſtrength and reſiſtance certain it is, that this <hi>City</hi> is exceeding well ſeated, were it as well fortified. It lyeth in a plain flat and levell, and hath no hills nigh unto it, from which it can any way be annoyed: and for the caſting and making of rowling Trenches, I think the ſoyle is hardly ſerviceable. If Art were no more wanting to the ſtrengh of it than Nature, in mine opinion it might be made almoſt impregnable. <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, ſeeing the preſent weakneſs of it, had once a purpoſe (as it is ſaid) to have ſtrenthened it according to the moderne Art of fortifications: but it went no further than the purpoſe. He was a great builder, and had may projects of Maſonry in his head, which were little for his profit; and this would have proved leſs than any: for beſides the infinite ſums of money, which would have been employed in ſo immenſe a work; what had this been in effect, but to put a ſword into a mad mans hand. The oft mutinies and ſeditions of this people hath made it little inferiour to <hi>Laigh,</hi> or <hi>Gaunt,</hi> the two moſt revolting Townes in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:54835:48"/>
And again, the <hi>Baracadoes</hi> againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>King Henry</hi> the third, and the long reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it made to himſelf being weak, were ſufficient to inſtruct him, what might be expected from it by his <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> when it ſhould be ſtrengthened and enabled to rebellion.</p>
               <p>The preſent ſtrength of the Town then is not great, the walles being very weak and ruinous; and thoſe other few helps which it hath being little available for defence. The beautifulleſt part of the whole reſiſtance is the Ditch, deep, praecipitate, and broad; and to ſay no more of it, an excellent ward were there any thing elſe correſpondent to it. As for the <hi>Fort</hi> next to St. <hi>Antonies</hi> gate called the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> it is in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit too little to protect the Town, and too low to command it. When Swords onely and Pick-axes were in uſe, and afterwards in the infancy of Gunnes, it did ſome ſervice in the Nature of of a <hi>Fortreſſe</hi>; now it onely ſerveth as a <hi>Priſon,</hi> principally for thoſe of the greater ſort, who will permit themſelves to be taken. It is ſaid to be built by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when they were <hi>Lords of Paris:</hi> and the <hi>Vulgar</hi> are all of this opinion. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the more learned ſort, make it to be the work of one of the <hi>Provosts</hi> of the <hi>City Du Cheſne</hi> calleth him <hi>Hugues Ambriott,</hi> in the time of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> the fifth, when as yet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had nothing to do here. The word <hi>Baſtille</hi> in general is a <hi>Fortreſſe</hi>; the article <hi>la</hi> prefixed before it maketh it a name, and appropriateth it to this building. There are alſo two little turrets juſt againſt the Gallery of the <hi>Louure</hi> on both ſides of the <hi>Seine,</hi>

intended for the defence of the River; though now they are little able to anſwer that intention. They alſo are fathered on the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; but how true I know not. Another place I marked, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned perhaps for a <hi>Rampart,</hi> but employed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at this time by Wind-mills: it is a goodly mount of earth, high and capacious, ſcituate cloſe unto the gate called <hi>St. Martin,</hi> the moſt defenſible part (if well manned) of all <hi>Paris.</hi> Thus is the ſtrength of this Town (as you ſee) but ſmall, and if <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, lay ſo long before it with his Army, it was not becauſe he could not take it, but becauſe he would not: <hi>He was loath</hi> (as <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> adviſed him,) <hi>to receive the bird naked,</hi> which he expected with all his feathers: and this anſwer he gave to my Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> who undertook to force an entry into it.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Streets</hi> they are made of a lawfull and competent bredth, well pitched under the foot with fair and large Pebble: This paving of it was the work of <hi>Philip Auguſtus, Anno</hi> 1223. or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts: before which time it could not but be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably dirty, if not unpaſſable. As it now is, the leaſt <hi>rain maketh it very ſlippery and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi> and as little a continuance of <hi>warm wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtinking and poiſononus:</hi> But whether this noyſomneſs proceed from the nature of the ground, or the ſluttiſhneſs of the people in their houſes, or the neglect of the Magiſtrates in not providing a ſufficiency of <hi>Scavingers,</hi> or all, I am not to determine. This I am confident of, that the <hi>nastieſt Lane in London, is Frankincenſe and Juniter to the ſweeteſt Street in this City.</hi> The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

I have ſpoken ſomewhat of the <hi>Fortifications</hi> of this Town, but they are but triflles: the only <hi>venome</hi> of the Streets is a ſtrength unto it more powerful, than the ditches or the Bullwark of <hi>St. Martin, Moriſon</hi> in his <hi>Itinera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> relateth how the <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>Prague in Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> were reparing the walls of the Town for fear of the <hi>Turks</hi>: but withal he addeth, that if the ſtink of the Streets kept him not thence, there was aſſurance to be looked for of the walls: I know not now how true it is of that <hi>City</hi>; I am ſure it may be juſtly verified upon this. It was therefore not injudiciouſly ſaid of an <hi>Engliſh Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> that he thought <hi>Paris</hi> was the <hi>ſtrongeſt Town in Chriſtendome</hi>: for he took ſtrong in that ſenſe, as we do in <hi>England,</hi> when we ſay, ſuch a man hath a ſtrong breath. Theſe things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it could not but be an infinite happineſse granted by Nature to our <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, that he never ſtopped his noſe at any ſtink, as our <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi> report of him; otherwiſe in my conſcience he had never been able to have kept his <hi>Court</hi> here. But that which moſt amazeth me is, that in ſuch a perpetuated conſtancy of ſtinks, there ſhould yet be found, ſo large and admirable a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety; a variety ſo ſpecifical and diſtinct, that any <hi>Chymicall</hi> noſe (I dare lay my life on it) after two or three perambulations, would hunt out blindfold each ſeveral ſtreet by the ſmell; as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54835:49"/>
as another by his eye. A Town of a ſtrange compoſition: one can hardly live in it in the Summer without poiſoning, in the Winter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out myring.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Buildings,</hi> they are I confeſs very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly and uniformly ſet out to the ſtreet ward; not unſeemly in themſelves and very ſuitable one with another: high and perpendicular, with windowes reaching almoſt from the top to the bottome. The houſes of the new mould in <hi>London</hi> are juſt after their faſhion, wherein the care and deſigne of our late <hi>Soveraigne King James,</hi> is highly to be magnified.

Their houſes are diſtinguiſhed by Signes, as with us, and under every ſigne there is printed in Capital Letters what ſigne it is: neither is it more than needs. The old ſhift off, This is a <hi>Cock,</hi> and This is a <hi>Bull,</hi> was never more requiſite in the infancy of Painting, than in this City, for ſo hideouſly, and ſo without reſemblance to the thing ſignified, are moſt of theſe <hi>Pencill Works,</hi> that I may without

danger ſay of them as <hi>Pſuedalus implautus</hi> doeh of the Letter which was written from <hi>Phaenicium</hi> to his young Mr. <hi>Callidorus: An abſecro herclé ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent quoque gallinae manus: nam has quidem galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ſcripſit.</hi> If a Hen would not ſcrape better <hi>Portraictures</hi> in a Dunghil, than they have hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up before their doors, I would ſend her to my <hi>Hoſteſſe of Toſtes,</hi> to be executed.</p>
               <p>And indeed generally the <hi>Artificers</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> are as ſlovenly in their Trades, as in their houſes; yet you may find nimble dancers, pretty Fidlers for a toy, and a Taylor that can trick you up after the beſt and neweſt faſhion. Their Cutlers make ſuch abominable and fearfull knives as would grieve a mans heart to ſee them; and the Glovers are worſe than they: you would imagine by their Gloves, that the hand for which they were made were cut off by the wreſt; yet on the other ſide, they are very perfect at Tooth-picks, Beard-bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, and (which I hold the moſt commendable Art of them) the cutting of a Seal. Their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are but one degree removed from a Pedler; ſuch as in <hi>England</hi> we call <hi>Chapmen</hi>; that is, a Pedler with a ſhop: and for <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> there is little uſe for them, Glaſſes there being moſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; both becauſe neat and becauſe cheap: I perſwade my ſelf that the two ſeveral ranks of ſhops in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> can ſhow more Plate, and more variety of Mercery warres, good and rich, than three parts of <hi>Paris. Merchants</hi> they have but not many; and thoſe which they have not very wealthy. The River ebbs not and floweth, not nigher them than fifteen miles or thereabouts;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54835:50"/>
and the Boats which thence ſerve the <hi>City,</hi> be no bigger than our Weſtren Barges. The principal means by which the people do ſubſiſt, are the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> moſt time held amongſt them, and the great reſort of <hi>Advodates</hi> and <hi>Clients,</hi> to the <hi>Chambers</hi> of <hi>Parliament:</hi> without theſe two crutches the Town would get a vile halting, and perhaps be ſcarce able to ſtand. What the eſtates of ſome of the wealthieſt Citizens may amount to, I cannot ſay: yet I dare conjecture it not to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous. The Author of the Book entitled <hi>Les eſtats du monde</hi> reckoneth it for a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, that ſome of our <hi>London Merchants</hi> ſhould be worth 100000. <hi>Crownes</hi>: we account that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate amongſt us not to be ſo wonderful; and may hence ſafely conclude, that they which made a Prodegy of ſo little, are not much worth themſelves.</p>
               <p>If you beleeve their apparrel, you may perhaps be perſwaded otherwiſe, that queſtionleſs ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no leſs than <hi>Millions</hi>; though like it is, that when they are in their beſt clothes, they are in the <hi>middle of their eſtate.</hi> But concernig the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous bravery of the poor <hi>Pariſian,</hi> take along with you this ſtory. Upon our firſt coming into <hi>Paris,</hi> there came to viſit a <hi>German Lord,</hi> whom we met a Ship-board, a couple of <hi>French Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,</hi> his acquaintance: the one of them (for I did not much obſerve the other) had a ſuit of <hi>Turkey Grogram</hi> dublet with Taffaty, cut with long ſlaſhes and carbonadoes after the <hi>French</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, and belayed with bugle lace; through the opening of his dublet appeared his ſhirt, of the

Pureſt Holland, and wrought with curious needle-work; the points of his waſt and knees all edged with a ſilver edging, his Garters Roſes and Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſutable to his points; a Beaver hat, and a pare of ſilk Stokings: his Cloak alſo of <hi>Turkey Grogram</hi> cut upon black <hi>Taffaty</hi>: This <hi>Lord</hi> (for who would have dared to gueſſe him other) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to me, and perceiving my ignorance in the <hi>French,</hi> accoſted me in <hi>Latine,</hi> which he ſpake indifferently well. After ſome diſcourſe he took notice of mine eyes which were then ſore, and Sea ſick; and promiſed me, if I would call on him at his lodging the next morning, to give me a water which ſuddenly would reſtore them to their ſtrength and vigor; I humbled thanked his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> for ſuch an ineffable and immerited fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, in the beſt complement and greateſt abai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance I could deviſe. It was not for nought thought I, that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> extoll ſo much, the humanity of this people: Nay I began to accuſe report of envy, as not having publiſhed the one half of their graces and affabilities. <hi>Quantillum enim virtutum iſtarum famâ acceperam.</hi> And thus taking my leave of his <hi>Honour,</hi> I greedily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the next morning: the morning come, and the hour of viſitting his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> almoſt at hand, I ſent a Servant to fetch a <hi>Barbar</hi> to combe me, and make me neat, as not knowing what occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I might have of ſeeing his <hi>Lady,</hi> or his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: upon the return of the meſſenger, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed <hi>His Altitude,</hi> and bidding me ſit down in the chair, he disburdened one of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckets, <hi>(quis hoc credat niſi ſit proteſte vetuſtas)</hi> of

a caſe of inſtruments, and the other of a bundle of linnen.

For the moſt part the houſes in them are old and ruinous; yet the <hi>Faulx bourg</hi> of <hi>St. Jacques</hi> is in pretty good faſhion, and the leaſt unſightly of them all except <hi>St. Germain</hi>: The <hi>Faulx bourg</hi> of <hi>St. Martin</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hath ſomewhat to commend it, which is, that the great <hi>Peſt houſe</hi> built by <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, is within the precincts of it.

You aſcend by thirty or forty ſteps fair and large, before you come to the quadrate, and thence by ſeveral ſtairs into the ſeveral rooms and chambers of it, which are very neatly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and richly furniſhed.

At this time their number is about ſeventy, their allowance a pint of Wine (their pint being but a thought leſs than our quart) and a certain quantity of bread daily.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54835:60"/>
of their ſeveral <hi>Nations.</hi> And here it is to be obſerved, that in the French Nation the Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator and Intrant is one year of the <hi>Dioceſs of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and the following year of the reſt of <hi>France,</hi> the reaſon why that <hi>Nation</hi> is ſubdivided: Theſe four <hi>Intrants</hi> thus named have amongſt them the election of their <hi>Rector,</hi> who is their ſupreme <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The preſent <hi>Rector</hi> is Mr. <hi>Tarriſnus</hi> of the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Harcourte,</hi> a Maſter of the <hi>Arts,</hi> for a <hi>Doctor</hi> is not capable of the office. The honour laſteth onely three moneths; which time expired, the <hi>Intrants</hi> proceed to a new election; though oftentimes it happeneth, that the ſame hath the leaſe of his authority renewed. Within the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of the Univerſity he taketh place next after the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Bloud:</hi> and at the publike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of <hi>Learning</hi> before the <hi>Cardinals</hi>; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he giveth them the precedency. But to <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Arch-biſhops</hi> he will not grant it upon any occaſion. It was not two moneths before my being there, that there happened a ſhrewd contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie about it. The <hi>King</hi> had then ſummoned an aſſembly of twenty five <hi>Biſhops</hi> of the <hi>Provinces</hi> adjoyning, to conſult about ſome <hi>Church</hi> affairs; and they had choſen the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Sorbonne</hi> to be their <hi>Senate-Houſe</hi>: When the firſt day of their ſitting came, a <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preach before them, began his <hi>Oration</hi> with <hi>Reverendiſſime Rector &amp; vos Ampliſſimi Praeſulei.</hi> Here the <hi>Arch-biſhop</hi> of <hi>Roven,</hi> a man of an high ſpirit interrupted him, and commanded him to invert his ſtile. He obeyed, and preſently the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:54835:60"/>
riſeth up with <hi>Impono tibi ſilentium,</hi> which is an <hi>Injunction</hi> within the compaſs of his power. Upon this, the <hi>Preacher</hi> being tongue-tied, the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie grew hot between the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and the <hi>Rector,</hi> both parties very eagerly pleading their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority. All the morning being almoſt ſpent in this altercation; a <hi>Cardinal</hi> wiſer than the reſt, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that their queſtion for that time might be laid aſide, and that the <hi>Rector</hi> would be pleaſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the <hi>Doctor</hi> to deliver his Sermon, beginning it without any <hi>Praeludium</hi> at all. To which requeſt the <hi>Rector</hi> yeilded; and ſo the contention at that time was ended.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Salus Academiae non vertitur in iſtis.</hi> It were more for honour and profit of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi> if the <hi>Rector</hi> would leave of to be ſo mindful of his place, and look a little to his office; for certainly the eye and utmoſt diligence of a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> was never wanting more; and yet more neceſſary in this place. <hi>Penelopes ſuiters</hi> never behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo inſolently in the houſe of <hi>

Such an opinion I am ſure, ſome of the <hi>Ariſtarchi</hi> of theſe dayes have lodged in their breaſts concerning the miſgovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our <hi>Athens.</hi> Perhaps a Kinſman of theirs hath played the unthrift equally of his time and his money: Hence their malice to it, and their inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives againſt it.

The principall foundation of their opinion is an <hi>Epistle Decretory</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> which in it ſelf carries its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation. The citations of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> on which this Superſtition is thought to be grounded, are all taken out of the <hi>Vulgar Tranſlation, Latine,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to <hi>St. Hierome</hi>; whereas neither was there in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> any publick Tranſlation of the <hi>Bible</hi> into <hi>Latine</hi>; neither was <hi>St. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> born within 300. years after him. <hi>Holy Water</hi> then is not of ſuch a ſtanding in the <hi>Church,</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> would perſwade us; and as yet I have not met with any, that can juſtly inform me at what time the <hi>Church</hi> received it. Many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions they have among them, whereof neither they nor we can tell the beginning.</p>

Indeed in the word <hi>Fluminae â</hi> the <hi>Poet</hi> was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what out, the waters onely of the Sea ſerving for the expiation of any crime; the reaſon was, <hi>cum propter vim igneam magnopere purgationibus conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneae putaretur.</hi> And for this cauſe queſtionleſs do the <hi>popiſh Prieſt</hi> uſe ſalt in the conſecration of their <hi>holy water,</hi> that it might as near as was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſemble the waters of the Sea in ſaltneſs, ſo willing are they in all circumſtances to act the Heathens.</p>
               <p>But I have kept you too long within the <hi>Church,</hi> it is now time to go up to the top, and ſurvey the out-works of it. It hath (as we have already ſaid) at the front two <hi>Towers</hi> of admirable beauty,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54835:67"/>
they are both of an equal height, and are each of them 377. ſteps in the aſcent. From thence we could clearly ſee the whole circuit of <hi>Paris,</hi> and each ſeveral ſtreet of it, ſuch as we have already deſcribed, of an orbicular form, and neatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted. From hence we could ſee the whole val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley round about it, ſuch as I have delineated alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy though not in ſuch lively colours as it meriteth. An object it is ſo delicious and raviſhing, that had the <hi>Devil</hi> taken <hi>King Henry</hi> the fourth and placed him on the top of this <hi>Temple,</hi> as he did our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> on that of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and ſaid unto him, all this will I give thee, this alone had been enough to have made him fall down and worſhip him.</p>
               <p>In One of thoſe <hi>Towers</hi> there is a <hi>Ring of Bels,</hi> in the other two onely, but thoſe for worth equal to all the reſt. The bigger of the two is ſaid to be greater than that of <hi>Roven</hi> ſo much talked of, as being eight yards and a ſpan in compaſs, and two yards and an half in depth; the bowl alſo of the clapper being one yard and a quarter round. Of a great weight it muſt needs be; and therefore (<hi>Multorum manibus grande levatur onus</hi>) there are no leſs than four main ropes beſides their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tayl ropes to ring it. By reaſon of the trouble it is never rung but in time of thunders, and theſe no mean ones neither. Leſſer Bels will ſerve the leſſer tempeſts; this is onely uſed in the horrider claps, and ſuch as threaten a diſſolution of <hi>Nature.</hi> But how well, as well this, as the ſmalleſt diſcharge that office, experience would tell us, were we void of reaſon; yet ſo much do the people affiance

themſelves to this conceit of the power of them, that they ſuppoſe it inherent to them continually, after the <hi>Biſhop</hi> hath baptized them, which is done in this manner. The <hi>Bell</hi> being ſo hanged, that it may be waſhed within and without, in cometh the <hi>Biſhop</hi> in his <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> robes, attended by one of his <hi>Deacons,</hi> and ſitting by the <hi>Bell</hi> in his chair, ſaith with a loud voice the 50, 53, 56, 66, 69, 85, and 129. <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> or ſome of them; then doth he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcize ſeverally the <hi>Salt</hi> and the <hi>Water,</hi> and having conjured thoſe ingredients into an <hi>holy water,</hi> he waſheth with it the <hi>Bell,</hi> both on the inſide and the outſide; wiping it dry with a linnen cloath, he readeth the 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, <hi>Pſalms</hi>; he draweth a <hi>croſs</hi> on it with his right thumb dipped in hallowed oyl (<hi>chryſome</hi> they call it) and then prayeth over it. His prayer finiſhed, he wipeth out the <hi>croſs,</hi> and having ſaid over it the 48. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> he draweth on it with the ſame oyle ſeven other <hi>croſſes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Sanctificetur &amp; conſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Domine Campana iſta, in nomine,</hi> &amp;c. After another prayer, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> taketh another <hi>Cenſer,</hi> and putting into it Myrrh and Frankincenſe, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it on fire, and putteth it under the <hi>Bell,</hi> that it may all receive ſume of it; this done, the 76. <hi>Pſalm</hi> read, &amp; ſome other prayers repeated, the <hi>Bell</hi> hath received his whole and intire <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and theſe vertues following, <hi>viz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t per illius tactam procul pellantur omnes inſidiae mimici, fragor grandinum, procella turbinum, impetus tempeſtatum,</hi> &amp;c. for ſo one of the <hi>Prayers</hi> reckoneth them: preſcribed in the <hi>Roman Pontifical</hi> authorized by <hi>Clement</hi> 8th.

               <p>Not farre from the Weſt-gate of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Noſtre-dame</hi> is the <hi>Hoſteldein,</hi> or <hi>le grand Hoſpital de Paris,</hi> firſt founded by <hi>King Lewis, Anno</hi> 1258. It hath been ſince beautified and inlarged, <hi>Anno</hi> 1535. by Mr. <hi>Anthony Prat Chancellor</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who augmented the number of the hoſpitallers, and gave fair revenues for the maintaining of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, Apothecaries,</hi> and religious men amongſt them. Since that time the <hi>Provoſt</hi> and <hi>Eſchevins</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> have been eſpecial Benefactors unto it. At your firſt entrance into it you come into their <hi>Chappel,</hi> ſmall but handſome and well furniſhed: After you paſs into a large gallery having four ranks of beds, two cloſe to the wals, and two in the middle. The beds are all ſutable the one to the other; their vallance, curtains and rugs being all yellow. At the further end of this a door open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into another chamber dedicated onely to ſick <hi>women</hi>; and within them another room, wherein <hi>women</hi> with child are lightned of their burden, and their children kept till ſeven years of age at the charge of the <hi>Hoſpital.</hi> At the middle of the firſt gallery on the left hand, were other four ranks of beds, little differing from the reſt, but that their furniture was blew, and in them there was no place for any, but ſuch as were ſome way wounded, and belonged properly to the <hi>Chirurgion.</hi> There are numbred in the whole <hi>Hoſpital</hi> no leſs than ſeven
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54835:69"/>
hundred beds (beſides thoſe of attendants, <hi>Prieſts, Apothecaries,</hi> &amp;c.) and in every bed two perſons. One would imagine, that in ſuch a variety of wounds and diſeaſes, a walk into it, and a view of it might ſavour more of curioſity than diſcretion. But indeed it is nothing leſs: for beſides that, no perſon of an infectious diſeaſe it admitted into it, which maketh much for the ſafety of ſuch as view it, all things are kept there ſo cleanly and orderly, that it is ſweeter walking there, than in the beſt ſtreet of <hi>Paris,</hi> none excepted.</p>
               <p>Next unto thoſe ſucceeded <hi>la Saincte Chapelle</hi> ſcituate in the middle of the <hi>Palais</hi>: a <hi>Chappel</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for its form, but more for its <hi>Reliques.</hi> It was founded by <hi>Lewis</hi> the ninth, vulgarly called <hi>St. Lewis, Anno</hi> 1248. and is divided into two parts, the <hi>

As for their <hi>Treaſurer, le Threaſurier,</hi> as they call their <hi>Governor,</hi> he hath granted him by eſpecial privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the licence to wear all the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> habits, except the <hi>Croſier-ſtaffe,</hi> and to bear himſelf as a <hi>Biſhop</hi> within the liberties of his <hi>Chappel.</hi> In the top of the upper <hi>Chappel</hi> (it is built almoſt in the form of a <hi>Synagogue</hi>) there hangeth the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion

Pretty <hi>divinity</hi> if one had time to examine it. Theſe <hi>Reliques,</hi> as the Table enformeth us, were given unto <hi>St. Lewis, Anno</hi> 1247. By <hi>Baldwin</hi> the ſecond, the laſt King of the <hi>Latines</hi> in <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> to which place the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>Palaeſtine</hi> had brought them, during the time that thoſe parts were harrowed by the <hi>Turks and Saracens.</hi> Certainly were they the ſame, which they are ſaid to be, I ſee no harm in it if we ſhould honour them. The very reverence due to antiquity and a ſilver head could not but extort ſome acknowledgement of reſpect even from a heathen. It was therefore commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably done by <hi>Pope Leo,</hi> having received a parcel of the <hi>Croſs</hi> from the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained it with reſpect. <hi>Particulam Dominicae Crucis</hi> (ſaith he in his 72. <hi>Epiſlte) cum eulogiis dilectionis tuae Veneranter accepi.</hi> To adore and worſhip that, or any other <hi>Relique</hi> whatſoever, with prayers and <hi>Anthems,</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> you ſee

do, never came within the minds of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and therefore <hi>St. Ambroſe</hi> calleth it <hi>Gentilis error, &amp; vanitas impiorum.</hi> This was alſo <hi>St. Hierom</hi>'s religion, as himſelf teſtifieth in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parius. Nos</hi> (faith he) <hi>non dico martyrum reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quias, ſed ne Solem quidem &amp; Lunam, non Angelos,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>colimus &amp; adoramus.</hi> Thus were thoſe two <hi>Fathers</hi> minded towards ſuch <hi>Reliques,</hi> as were known to be no others than what they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Before too many <hi>Centuries</hi> of years had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the true ones, and the impoſture of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had brought in the falſe. Had they lived in our times, and ſeen the ſuppoſed <hi>Reliques</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> not honoured onely, but adored and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped by the blind and infatuated people, what would they have ſaid, or rather what would they not have ſaid: Queſtionleſs, the leaſt they could do, were to take up the complaint of <hi>Vigilantius</hi> (the <hi>Papiſts</hi> reckon him for an <hi>Heretick</hi>) ſaying, <hi>Quid neceſſe eſt tanto honore, non ſolum honorare ſed etiam ador are, illud neſcio quid, quod in vaſculo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferendo colis.</hi>

But their power
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54835:74"/>
is moſt eminent in diſpoſing the affaires of <hi>State</hi> and of the <hi>Kingdome</hi>: for ſuch prerogatives have the <hi>French Kings</hi> given hereunto, that they can neither denounce Warre, nor conclude Peace, without the conſent (a formall one at the leaſt) of this <hi>Chamber.</hi> An <hi>Alieniation</hi> of the leaſt of the Lands of the Crown, is not any whit valued, unleſs confirmed by this <hi>Court</hi>; neither are his <hi>Edicts</hi> in force till they are here verified: nor his <hi>Letters Pattents</hi> for the creating of a <hi>Peere,</hi> till they are here allowed of. Moſt of theſe I confeſs, are little more than matters of form, the <hi>Kings</hi> power and pleaſure being become boundleſs: yet ſufficient to ſhew the body of Authority which they once had, and the ſhaddow of it which they ſtill keep: yet of late they have got into their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing one priviledge belonging formerly to the <hi>Conventus Ordinum,</hi> or the Aſſembly of the three <hi>Eſtates</hi>; which is the conferring of the <hi>Regency,</hi> or protection of their <hi>Kings</hi> during their minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. That the Aſſembly of the three <hi>Eſtates</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had this priviledge is evident by their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Thus we find them to have made <hi>Queene Blanche Regent</hi> of the <hi>Realm</hi> during the non-age of her Son <hi>St. Lewiis, Anno</hi> 1227. that they declared <hi>Phillip le Valois</hi> ſucceſſor to the <hi>Crowne,</hi> in caſe that the widdow of <hi>Charles de belle,</hi> was not delivered of a Son, <hi>Anno</hi> 1328.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54835:75"/>
late example of the power of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> in this very caſe; for the ſame day that <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth was ſlain by <hi>Raviliae,</hi> the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> met, and after a ſhort conſultation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>Mary de Medices,</hi> Mother to the <hi>King Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> for the Government of the State, (during the minority of her Son) with all power and authority: ſuch are the words of the <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> dated the 14. of <hi>May,</hi> 1610.</p>
               <p>It cannot be ſaid but this <hi>Court</hi> deſerveth not onely this, but any other indulgence whereof any one member of the Common-wealth is capable. So watchful are they over the health of the <hi>State,</hi> and ſo tenderly do they take the leaſt danger threatned to the liberties of that <hi>Kingdome,</hi> that they may not unjuſtly be called <hi>Patres Patriae.</hi> In the year 1614. they ſeazed upon a diſcourſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Suarez</hi> a <hi>Jeſuite</hi> entitled <hi>Adverſus Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canae ſectae errores,</hi> wherein the <hi>Popes</hi> temporal power over <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> is averred: which they ſentenced to be burnt in the <hi>Pallace</hi> yard by the publick Hangman. The yeare before they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the ſame puniſhment upon a vain and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemous diſcourſe penned by <hi>Gaſper Niopins,</hi> a fellow of a moſt deſperate brain, and a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary.

Thus it is evident, that the titles

which the <hi>French</hi> writers gave it, as the true <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of the <hi>French juſtice,</hi> the <hi>Buttreſſe</hi> of <hi>Equity,</hi> the <hi>Guardian</hi> of the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the like, are abundantly deſerved of it.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Chamber</hi> in eſteem is the <hi>Tournelle,</hi> which handleth all matters Criminal. It is ſo called from <hi>Tourner,</hi> which ſignifieth to change or alter; becauſe the <hi>Judges</hi> of the other ſeveral Chambers give ſentence in this, according to their ſeveral turnes. The reaſon of which Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is ſaid to be, leaſt a continual cuſtome of condemning ſhould make the <hi>Judges</hi> leſs merciful, and more prodigall of blood. An order full of health and providence; it was inſtituted by the above named <hi>Phillip le Belle,</hi> at the ſame time when he made the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſedentary at <hi>Paris</hi>; and beſides its particular and original employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it receiveth Appeals from, and redreſſeth the errours of the <hi>Provoſt</hi> of <hi>Paris.</hi> The other five Chambers are called <hi>des Enqueſts,</hi> or <hi>Camerae Inquaſitionum:</hi> the firſt and ancienteſt of them, was erected alſo by <hi>Phillip le Belle,</hi> and afterwards divided into two by <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of <hi>Proceſſes</hi> being greater than could be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in theſe <hi>Courts,</hi> there was added a third. <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt eſtabliſhed the fourth, for the better raiſing of a ſum of money which then he wanted: every one of the new <hi>Counſellers</hi> paying right dearly for his place. The fifth and laſt was founded in the year 1568. In each of theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Chambers, there be two <hi>Preſidents,</hi> and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Counſellers,</hi> beſide <hi>Advocates</hi> and <hi>Proctors, ad placitum.</hi> In the <hi>Tournelle</hi> which is the aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54835:76"/>
of all the other <hi>Courts,</hi> there are ſuppoſed to be no fewer than two hundred <hi>Officers</hi> of all ſorts, which is no great number conſidering the many Cauſes there handled. In the <hi>Tournelle,</hi> the <hi>Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> ſit on matters of life and death; in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Enqueſts</hi> they examine onely civil Affairs, of eſtate, title, debts, and the like. The <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in theſe <hi>Courts</hi> are called <hi>Advocates</hi>; and muſt be at the leaſt <hi>Licentiats</hi> in the ſtudy of the <hi>Law.</hi> At the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of <hi>Tholoza</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> they admit of none but <hi>Doctors</hi>: now the form of admitting them is this. In an open and frequent <hi>Court,</hi> one of the agedeſt of the <hi>Long Robe,</hi> preſenteth the party which deſireth admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to the <hi>Kings Atturney General,</hi> ſaying with a loud voice, <hi>Paiſſe a Cour recevoir N. N. Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> (or <hi>Docteur) en droict civil, a l'office d' Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi> This ſaid; the <hi>Kings Atturney</hi> biddeth him hold up his hand, and ſaith to him in <hi>Latine, Tu jurabis obſervare omnes Reges Conſuetudines,</hi> he anſwereth <hi>Iuro,</hi> and departeth. At the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door of the <hi>Court,</hi> whereof he is now ſworne an <hi>Advocate,</hi> he payeth two <hi>Crownes,</hi> which is forthwith put into the common Treaſury, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the relief of the diſtreſſed-Widdows, of ruined <hi>Advocates</hi> and <hi>Proctors: Hanc veniam pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timuſque damuſque.</hi> It may be their own caſes, and therefore it is paid willingly. The higheſt preferment of which theſe <hi>Advocates</hi> are capable, is that of <hi>Chauncellor</hi>: an Office of great power and profit. The preſent <hi>Chauncellor</hi> is named <hi>Mr. d' Allegre,</hi> by birth of <hi>Chartres,</hi> he hath no ſettled <hi>Court</hi> wherein to exerciſe his authority; but hath
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54835:76"/>
in all the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the ſupream place whenſoever he will vouchſafe to viſit them. He is alſo <hi>Preſident</hi> of the <hi>Councill</hi> of <hi>Eſtate</hi> by his place, and on him dependeth the making of good and ſacred <hi>Lawes,</hi> the adminiſtration of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> the reformation of ſuperfluous, and abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unprofitable <hi>Edicts,</hi> &amp;c. He hath the keeping of the <hi>Kings</hi> geeat <hi>Seal,</hi> and by vertue of that, either paſſeth or putteth back ſuch <hi>Letters Pattents,</hi> and <hi>Writs</hi> as are exhibited to him. He hath under him immediately for the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of his Affairs, four <hi>Maſters</hi> of the <hi>Requeſts,</hi> and their <hi>Courts.</hi> Their Office and manner of proceeding is the ſame, which they alſo uſe in <hi>England</hi>: in the perſons there is thus much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that in <hi>Franee</hi> two of them muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually of the <hi>Clergy.</hi> One of their <hi>Courts</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ancient, and hath in it two <hi>Preſidents.</hi> which are two of the <hi>Maſters,</hi> and fourteen <hi>Counſellers.</hi> The other is of a later erection; as being founded <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. and in that the two other of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> and eight <hi>Councellers</hi> give ſentence.</p>
               <p>Thus have I taken a veiw of the ſeveral <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Juriſdictions, as far as my information could conduct me. One thing I noted further, and in my mind the faireſt ornament of the <hi>Pallace,</hi> which is the neatneſs and decency of the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi> in their apparrel; for beſides the faſhion of their habit, which is I aſſure you exceeding plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and comely; themſelves by their own care and love to handſomeneſs, adde great luſtre to their garments, and more to their perſons.

Of this rank were <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Phochion, Alcibiades,</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Athenians, Antonius, Mar.

The <hi>Engliſh Clergy</hi> though otherwiſe the moſt accompliſht in the World, in this folly deſerveth no Apologie, being ſo ſtrangely ill affected to the Pleaders of this Nation, that I fear it may be ſaid of ſome of them, <hi>Quod invidiam non ad cauſam ſed perſonam, et ad valantatem dirigant.</hi> A weakneſs not more unworthy of them, than prejudicial to them, for

foſtering between both Gownes ſuch an unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary emulation, they do but exaſperate that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which they cannot controle, and betray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to much envy and diſcontentedneſs.

               <p>WE have diſcharged the <hi>King</hi> of one <hi>Pallace,</hi> and muſt follow him to the other, where we ſhall find his reſidence. It is ſeated in the weſt ſide of the Town or <hi>Ville</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> hard by <hi>Porte neufue,</hi> and alſo by the new Bridge. An Houſe of great fame, and which the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> have long kept their <hi>Courts</hi> in. It was firſt built by <hi>Phillip Auguſtus, anno</hi> 1214. and by him intended for a Caſtle, it then ſerving to impriſon the more <hi>potent of the Nobleſſe,</hi> and to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54835:78"/>
lay up the <hi>Kings</hi> Treaſury; for that cauſe it was well moated and ſtrengthened with walls and draw Bridges, very ſerviceable in thoſe times. It had the name of <hi>Louure quaſi L'oeuure,</hi> or the work: the Building by way of excellencie. An <hi>Etymologie</hi> which draweth nigher to the ear than the underſtanding, or the eye. And yet the <hi>French</hi> writers would make it a miracle: <hi>Du Cheſne</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it <hi>ſuperbe baſtiment qui n' a ſon eſgal en toute la Chriſtiente</hi>: and you ſhall hear it called in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>Baſtiment qui paſſe muiourd huy en ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellenee et en grandeur, tous les autres.</hi> Brave <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligies,</hi> if all were Gold that gliſtered. It hath given up now its charge of money, and great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to the <hi>Baſtile</hi>; and at this time ſerveth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to impriſon the <hi>Court.</hi> In my life I never ſaw any thing more abuſed by a good report, or that more belyeth the rumours that go of it. The ordinary talk of vulgar travellers, and the bigg words of the <hi>French</hi> had made me expect at the leaſt ſome prodigie of Architecture, ſome ſuch Majeſtical houſe as the <hi>Sunne Don Phoebus</hi> is ſaid to have dwelt in by <hi>Ovid.</hi>

qualis erat? talis erat qualem nunquem ego vidi.</hi> But I was much deceived in that hope, and could find nothing in it to admire, much leſs to envy. The Fable of the <hi>Mountaine</hi> which was with child, and brought forth a Mouſe, is queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Fable. This Houſe, and the large fame it hath in the world is the <hi>Morall</hi> of it. Never was there an Houſe more unſuitable to it ſelf in the particular examination of parts, nor more unſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Character and eſteem of it in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſurvey of the whole.</p>
               <p>You enter into it over two <hi>Draw-bridges</hi>; and thorough three <hi>Gates,</hi> ruinous enough and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly unſightly. In the <hi>Quadrangle</hi> you meet with three ſeveral faſhions of buildings, of three ſeveral ages; and they ſo unhappily joyned one to the other, that one would half beleeve they were clapped together by an <hi>Earthquake.</hi> The <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> parts of it are new, and indeed <hi>Prince like,</hi> being the work of <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, and his Son <hi>Henry</hi>: had it been all caſt into the ſame mould, I perſwade my ſelf, that it would be very gratious and lovely. The other two are of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient work and ſo contemptible, that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the reſt: and of theſe I ſuppoſe the one to be at the leaſt a hundred years older than his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: ſuch is it without. As for the inſide it is farre more graceful, and would be pleaſing at the entrance, were the <hi>Gaurd Chamber</hi> reformed. Some <hi>Hugonot Architect</hi> which were not in love with the errours of Antiquity, might make a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty room of it: a <hi>Catholick Carpenter</hi> would never get credit by it; for whereas the provident thrift
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54835:79"/>
of our fore fathers intended it (for the Houſe would elſe be too narrow for the <hi>Kings</hi> retinue) both for a room of ſafety and of pleaſure, both for <hi>Bellmen</hi> and <hi>Dancers</hi>; and for that cauſe made up ſome ſix ranks of ſeats on each ſide. That ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringneſs in the more curious eyes of this time is little <hi>King like.</hi> Country wenches might with an indifferent ſtomack abuſe a Galliard in it, or it might perhaps ſerve, with a Stage at one end, to entertain the <hi>Pariſiens</hi> at a Play; or with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition in the middle, it might be divided into pretty plauſible <hi>Cockpits.</hi> But to be employed in the nature it is now, either to ſolace the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords</hi> in a dance, or to give any forraign <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour</hi> his welcome in a <hi>Maſque,</hi> is little ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table with the majeſty of a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Chambers</hi> of it are well built, but ill furniſhed; the hangings of them being ſomewhat below a meanneſs: and yet of theſe here is no ſmall ſcarcity, for as it is ſaid of the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nadomus et manſioni ſufficit et ſepulturae:</hi> ſo may we of this <hi>Prince.</hi> The ſame Chamber ſerveth for to Iodge him, feed him, &amp; alſo to confer &amp; diſcourſe with his <hi>Nobility.</hi> But like enough it is that this want may proceed from the ſeveral <hi>Courts</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Monſieur,</hi> the <hi>Queene Mother,</hi> and the <hi>Queene Regnant,</hi> being all kept within it.</p>
               <p>Proceed we now to the two <hi>Galleries,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt is that of the <hi>Queene Mother,</hi> as being beautified and adorned exceedingly, by <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine de Medices,</hi> Mother to <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth. It containeth the Pictures of all the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the moſt loved of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54835:79"/>
their <hi>Queens</hi> ſince the time of <hi>St. Lewis.</hi> They ſtand each <hi>King</hi> oppoſite to his <hi>Queen,</hi> ſhe being that of his Wives, which either brought him moſt eſtate, or his <hi>Succeſſor.</hi> The tables are all of a juſt length, very fair, and according to my little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Painter, of a moſt excellent workmanſhip. And which addeth more grace to it, they are in a manner a perfect hiſtory of the State and Court of <hi>France</hi> in their ſeveral times, For under each of the <hi>Kings</hi> pictures they have drawn the potraitures of moſt of their <hi>Lords,</hi> whom valour and true courage in the field enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled beyond their births: Under each of the <hi>Queens,</hi> the lively ſhapes of the moſt principal <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> whoſe beauty and vertue had honoured the Court. A dainty invention, and happily expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. At the further end of it ſtand the laſt <hi>King,</hi> and the preſent <hi>Queen Mother,</hi> who fill up the whole room. The ſucceeding <hi>Princes,</hi> if they mean to live in their pictures, muſt either build new places for them, or elſe make uſe of the Long Gallery built by <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth in to that of the <hi>Queen Mother.</hi> A Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is of an incredible length, as being above 500. yards long, and of a breadth and height not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable. A room built rather for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation than uſe, and ſuch as hath more in it of the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of ist Founder than the <hi>Grace</hi>: It is ſaid to have been erected purpoſely to joyn the <hi>Louure</hi> unto the houſe and garden of the <hi>Tuilleries</hi>: an unlikely matter, that ſuch a ſtupendious building ſhould be deſigned onely for a cleanly convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance into a Summer-houſe. Others are of opinion,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54835:80"/>
that he had a reſolution to have the Houſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangular, every ſide being correſpondent to this, which ſhould have been the common Gallery to the reſt, which deſign had it taken effect, this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> would at once have been the wonder of the world, and the envy of it. For my part I dare be of the laſt mind, as well becauſe the ſecond is in part begun, as alſo conſidering how infinitely this <hi>King</hi> was affected to building. The place <hi>Daulphin,</hi> and the place <hi>Royal,</hi> two of the fineſt piles of <hi>Paris,</hi> were erected partly by his purſe, but principally by his encouragement. The new <hi>Bridge</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> was meerly his work; ſo was alſo the new <hi>Palace,</hi> and the moſt admirable <hi>Water-Works of St. Germanen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay</hi>; this long <hi>Gallery</hi> and the <hi>Peſthouſe</hi> owe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly unto him, and the houſe of <hi>Fountain bleau,</hi> which is the faireſt in <hi>France,</hi> is beholding to him for moſt of its beauty. Adde to this his fortifications beſtowed on the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> and his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to have ſtrengthened <hi>Paris</hi> according to the modern art of Towns, and you will find the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of <hi>Parietaria</hi> or <hi>Wall-floure,</hi> which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſcoffingly gave unto <hi>Trajane</hi> for his great humour of building, to be due unto this <hi>King,</hi> but ſeriouſly and with reverence.</p>
               <p>Beſides the general love he had to building, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> had alſo an ambition to go beyond enſample, which alſo induceth me further to beleive his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of making that large and admirable quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle above ſpoken of, to have been ſerious and real. For to omit others, certain it is, that he had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of great ſpirit and difficulty, which was to joyn the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea and the <hi>Ocean</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54835:80"/>
and to make the navigation from the one to the other through <hi>France,</hi> and not to paſs by the ſtraight of <hi>Gibraltare.</hi> It came into counſel <hi>Anno</hi> 1604. and was reſolved to be done by this meanes. The River of <hi>Garond</hi> is navigable from the <hi>Ocean</hi> almoſt to <hi>Tholoza</hi>; and the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf into the land by a little River (whoſe name I know not) as high as <hi>Narbonne.</hi> Betwixt theſe two places was there a navigable channel to have been digged, and it proceeded ſo far towards being actuated, that a workman had undertaken it, and the price was agreed upon. But there ariſing ſome diſcontents between the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> about the building of the <hi>Fort Fuentis,</hi> in the Countrey of the <hi>Griſons</hi>; the King not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what uſe he might have of treaſure in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, commanded the work not to go forward: However it is to be commended in the attempt, which was indeed Kingly, and worthy his ſpirit, and praiſe him in his heroick purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign:</p>
               <q>Quem ſi non tenuit, magnis tamen excidit auſis.</q>
               <p>But the principal beauty, if I may judge of this ſo much admired Palace of the <hi>Louure,</hi> is a low plain room, paved under foot with brick, and without any hangings or tapeſtry on the ſides; yet being the beſt ſet out and furniſhed, to my content, of any in <hi>France</hi>: It is called <hi>La ſalle des Antiques,</hi> and hath in it five of the ancienteſt and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt pieces of all the <hi>Kingdom</hi>: For the <hi>Nation</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally is regardleſs of antiquity, both in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents

and in the ſtudy of it; ſo that you ſhall hardly find any ancient inſcription, or any famous ruine ſnatched from the hand of time, in the beſt of their <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Churches.</hi> In the <hi>Church</hi> onely of <hi>Amiens</hi> could I meet with any antient Character; which alſo was but a <hi>Gothiſh Dutch Letter,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed nothing but the name and vertue of a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in whoſe time it was.

                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:54835:83"/>THe <hi>King</hi> is the ſoul of the Court, without his preſence it is but a Carcaſs, a thing without life and honour. I dare not ſo farre wrong the <hi>Louure,</hi> as to make it but a common houſe, and rob it of the fruition of its <hi>Prince,</hi> and therefore will treat of him here; though during my aboad in <hi>France</hi> he lay all the while in <hi>Fountain Bleau</hi>: For perſon he is of the middle ſtature, and rather well proportioned than large. His face knoweth little yet of a beard, but that which is, is black and ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; his complexion alſo much of the ſame heiw, carrying in it a certain boyſterouſneſs, and that in a further meaſure than what a graceful Majeſty can admit of: So that one can hardly ſay of him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſpice of Courtſhip, what <hi>Paterculus</hi> did of <hi>Tiberius, Quod viſus praetulerit principem,</hi> that his countenance proclaimed him a <hi>King.</hi> But queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs his greateſt defect is want of utterance, which is very unpleaſing by reaſon of a deſperate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable ſtammering, which defect is likely more and more to grow upon him. At this time he is aged twenty four years, and as much as ſince the 27 day of <hi>September</hi> laſt, which was his birth day, an age which he beareth not very plauſibly; want of beard and the ſwarthineſs of his complexion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him ſeem elder. At the age of eleven years he was affianced to the <hi>Lady Anna Infanta of Spain,</hi> by whom as yet he hath no children. It is thought by many, and covertly ſpoken by divers in <hi>France,</hi> that the principal cauſe of the <hi>Queens</hi> bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs proceedeth from <hi>Spain,</hi> that people being loath to fall under the <hi>French</hi> obedience, which may very well happen, ſhe being the elder Siſter of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54835:83"/>
the <hi>King.</hi> For this cauſe, in the ſeventh article of marriage there is a clauſe, that neither the ſaid <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta,</hi> nor the Children born by her (to the <hi>King</hi>) ſhall be capable to inherit any of the eſtates of the <hi>King of Spain</hi>; and in the eighth article ſhe is bound to make an act of renunciation under her own hand-writing, as ſoon as ſhe cometh to be twelve years old, which was accordingly performed. But this being not ſufficient to ſecure their fears, it is thought that ſhe was ſome way or other diſabled from conception, before ever ſhe came into the <hi>Kings</hi> embraces: A great crime I confeſs if true: yet I cannot ſay with <hi>Tully</hi> in his defence of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius: Novum crimen Caie Caeſar, &amp; hec tempus mauditum. Jaqueline Counteſs of Holland</hi> was Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen to <hi>Philip Duke</hi> of <hi>Burgundie</hi>: Her being fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful would have debarred him from thoſe eſtates of <hi>Holland, Zealand</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Freezland</hi>; therefore though ſhe had three Husbands there was order taken ſhe ſhould never have Child: with her two firſt Husbands the <hi>Duke</hi> would never ſuffer her to live: and when ſhe had ſtollen a wedding with <hi>Frane of Borſelle</hi> one of her ſervants, the <hi>Dukes Phyſitians</hi> gave him ſuch a potion, that ſhe might as well have married an <hi>Eunuch</hi>: upon this injury the poor <hi>Lady</hi> died; and the <hi>Duke</hi> ſucceeded in thoſe Countries; which by his Grand-child <hi>Marie</hi> were conveyed over into the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> together with the reſt of his eſtate. I dare not ſay, that that Family hath inherited his practiſes with his lands; and yet I have heard, that the <hi>Infanta Iſabella</hi> had the like or worſe meaſure afforded her, before ſhe was bedded to the <hi>Arch-duke Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus.</hi>

The youngeſt, <hi>Henrietta Mariae,</hi> is newly married to his moſt Excellent Majeſty of <hi>England,</hi> to whom may ſhe prove of a moſt happy and fruitful womb. <hi>Et pulchra faciat te prole parentem.</hi> Of theſe alliances the firſt were very profitable to both <hi>Princes,</hi> could there be made a marriage between the Kingdoms as well as the <hi>Kings.</hi> But it is well known, that the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of each people are divided, more unconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mountains, than their dominions: The <hi>French</hi> extreamly hating the proud humour and ambition of the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> We may therefore account each of them in theſe marriages to have rather intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the perpetuity of their particular houſes, than the ſtrength of their Empires; and that they more deſired a noble ſtock whereon to graft poſterity, than power. The alliance with <hi>Savoy</hi> is more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious, though leſs powerful than that of <hi>Spain.</hi> For if the <hi>King of France</hi> can keep this <hi>Prince</hi> on his party, he need not fear the greatneſs of the other, or any of his faction.

               <p>As for the <hi>Kings</hi> baſtard Brethren they are four in number, and born of three ſeveral beds.

Gaſton,</hi> born the 25th of <hi>April, Anno</hi> 1608. A Prince of a brave and manlike aſpect, likely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit as large a part of his Fathers ſpirit, as the <hi>King</hi> doth of his Crown. He is entituled <hi>Duke of Aniou,</hi> as being the third Son of <hi>France,</hi> but his next elder Brother the <hi>Duke of Orleance</hi> being dead in his childhood, he is vulgarly and properly called, <hi>Monſieur.</hi> This title is different from that of <hi>Daulphin,</hi> in that that title is onely appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Heir apparent, being the <hi>Kings</hi> eldeſt Son living.

Had the <hi>Duke of Orleance</hi> lived, he had eſpouſed her long ere this; but it is generally beleived, that this <hi>Prince</hi> is ſo affected.

In the eleventh moneth after his deceaſe, his young <hi>Princeſs</hi> was brought to bed of a young Son, which is now <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde.

dealt with the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> to declare the place of the firſt <hi>Prince</hi> of the bloud to belong to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi>: And for the clearer and more evident proof of the title, twenty four phyſitians of good faith and skill made an open proteſtation of oath in the Coutt, that it was not onely poſſible but common for Women to be delivered in the eleventh moneth.

There are numbred in it (as we ſaid before) twelve <hi>Archbiſhopricks,</hi> an hundred and four <hi>Biſhopricks</hi>: To theſe add five hundred and fourty <hi>Archpriorities,</hi> one thouſand four hundred and fifty <hi>Abbies</hi>; twelve thouſand three hundred and twenty <hi>Priorities,</hi> the ſixty ſeven <hi>Nunneries,</hi> ſeven hundred <hi>Covents</hi> of <hi>Friers,</hi> two hundred fifty nine <hi>Commendams</hi> of the Order of <hi>Malta,</hi> and one hundred and thirty thouſand <hi>Pariſh Prieſts,</hi> yet this is not all. Their reckoning was made in the year 1598. ſince which time the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Colledges founded for them, and they are known to be none of the pooreſt. To maintain this large wilderneſs of men, the <hi>Statiſts</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who have proportioned the Country, do allow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Clergy</hi> almoſt a fourth part of the whole.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54835:93"/>
For ſuppoſing <hi>France</hi> to contain two hundred millions of <hi>Arpens</hi> (a meaſure ſomewhat bigger than one Acre) they have allotted to the Church for its temporal revenue forty ſeven millions of them. In particular of the <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots,</hi> and Pariſh <hi>Prieſts,</hi> they of <hi>Aulx, Alby, Clumai,</hi> and <hi>St. Eſtiennes</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> are ſaid to be the wealthieſt. The <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Aux</hi> in <hi>Gaſcoyne</hi> is valued at 400000. liures, or 40000 <hi>li.</hi> Engliſh yearly. The <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Alby</hi> in <hi>Languedoc</hi> is prized at 100000. <hi>Florens,</hi> which is a fourth part of it, a great part of the revenue ariſing out of Saffron. The <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Clumac</hi> in the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Burgundy</hi> is ſaid to be worth 50000 Crowns yearly, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Abbot</hi> being <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lorreine, Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Rhemes</hi> and <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>St. Denis.</hi> The Pariſh <hi>Prieſt</hi> of <hi>St. Eſtiennes</hi> is judged to receive yearly no fewer than eight thouſand Crowns, a good intra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do. As for the vulgar Clergy, they have little tithe, and leſs glebe; moſt part of that Revenue being appropriated unto <hi>Abbies</hi> and other religious Houſes. The greateſt part of their meanes is the <hi>Baiſemen,</hi> which is the Church offerings of the people at <hi>Chriſtnings, Marriages, Burials, Dirges, Indulgences</hi> and the like, which is thought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to almoſt as much as the temporal eſtate of the Church: An <hi>Income</hi> able to maintain them in good abundance, were it not for the greatneſs of their number. For reckoning that there are (as we have ſaid) in <hi>France</hi> one hundred and thirty thouſand Pariſh <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and that there are onely twenty ſeven thouſand four hundred Pariſhes, it muſt of neceſſity be, that every Prriſh, one with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54835:93"/>
another, hath no fewer than four Prieſts, too many to be rich.</p>
               <p>But this were one of the leaſt injuries offered to the <hi>French,</hi> thrift, and would little hinder them from riſing, if it were not, that the goodlieſt of their preferments are before their faces given unto Boyes and Children. An affront, which not onely deſpaireth them of the honours due unto their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but diſhearteneth them in their ſtudies, and by conſequence draweth them to debauched and ſlanderous courſes.

The Clergy therefore, <hi>Anno</hi> 1617. being aſſembled at the houſe of <hi>Auſtin Friers</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> (as every two years they uſe to do) being to take their leaves of the <hi>King,</hi> elected the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Aire</hi> to be their <hi>Spokeſman,</hi> and to certifie his Majeſty of their greivances. In performing which buſineſs, the principal thing of which he ſpake was to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. That whereas his Majeſty was bound to give them <hi>Fathers,</hi> he gave them Children; that the name of <hi>Abbot</hi> ſignifieth a <hi>Father,</hi> and the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> was full of fatherly authority, yet <hi>Erance</hi> notwithſtanding was now filled with <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Abbots</hi> which are yet in their Nurſes arms, or elſe under their Regents in Colledges. Nay more, that the abuſe goeth before the being, Children being commonly deſigned to <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> &amp; <hi>Abbacies</hi> before they were born. He alſo made another Complaint, that the Sovereign Courts by
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54835:94"/>
their decrees had attempted upon the authority which was committed to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> even in that which concerned meerly <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> diſcipline and government of the Church. To theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints he gave them indeed a very gratious hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but it never went further than a hearing, being never followed by redreſs. The Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment knew too well the ſtrength of their own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the <hi>King</hi> was loath to take from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thoſe excellent advantages of binding to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his Nobility, by the ſpeedy preferring of their Children: And ſo the Clergy departed with a great deal of envy, and a little of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Like enough it were, that the <hi>Pope</hi> would in part redreſs this injury, eſpecially in the point of <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> if he were able, but his wings are ſhrewdly clipped in this Country, neither can he flie at all, but as farre as they pleaſe to ſuffer him. For his temporal power, they never could be induced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, as we ſee in their ſtories, <hi>Anno</hi> 1610. the <hi>Divines</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> in a Declaration of theirs tender'd to the <hi>Queen Mother,</hi> affirm the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the <hi>Pope</hi> to be an erroneus doctrine, and the ground of that helliſh poſition of depoſing and killing of <hi>Kings. Anno</hi> 1517. when the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Luteram</hi> had determined the <hi>Pope</hi> to be the Head of the <hi>Church</hi> in cauſes alſo temporal, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>univerſity</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> teſtified againſt it, in an <hi>Apoligie</hi> of theirs dated the twelfth of <hi>March</hi> the ſame year. <hi>Leo decimus</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Apologie) in quidam coetu non tamen in ſpiritu Domini congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, contra fidem Catholicam &amp;c. ſacrum Baſilienſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54835:94"/>
Concilium damnavit</hi>; In which Councill of <hi>Baſill,</hi> the ſupremacy of the <hi>Pope</hi> was condemned. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> forget to maintain their own authority: And therefore whereas <hi>Pope Boniface</hi> the eighth, had in a peremptory Letter Written to <hi>Phillip le Belle King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> ſtiled himſelf, <hi>Dominus totius Mundi tam in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralibus quam in ſpiritualibus</hi>: the <hi>King</hi> returned him an anſwer with an <hi>Epithite</hi> ſutable to his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy: <hi>Sciat maxima tua fatuitas nos intempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus alicui non ſubeſſe,</hi> &amp;c. The like anſwer though in modeſter termes, was ſent to another of the <hi>Popes</hi> by <hi>St. Lewis</hi>; a man of a moſt mild and ſweet diſpoſition, yet unwilling to forgoe his Royalties.</p>
               <p>His ſpiritual power is almoſt as little in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, though more in ſhew; for whereas the <hi>Councill</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> hath been an eſpeciall authorizer of the <hi>Popes</hi> ſpiritual ſupremacy; the <hi>French</hi> Church never would receive it: by this means the <hi>Biſhops</hi> keep in their hands their own full au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, whereof an obedience to the decrees of that <hi>Councill</hi> would deprive them. It was truly ſaid by <hi>St. Gregory,</hi> and they well knew it: Lib. 7. Epiſt. 70. <hi>Si unus univerſalis eſt, reſtat ut vos Epiſcopinon Sitis.</hi> Further the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> in their Declaration <hi>Anno</hi> 1610. above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, plainly affirme that it is directly oppoſite to the doctrine of the Church, which the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> hath alwaies maintained; that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power of a Monarch in the ſpiritual Government of the Church. To look upon higher times, when the <hi>Councill</hi> of <hi>Conſtance</hi> had ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54835:95"/>
the authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> unto that of a <hi>Councill. John Gerſon Theologus Pariſienſis magni nominis,</hi> defended that deeree, and entitleth them <hi>Pernicioſos eſſe ad modum adulatores, qui tyranidem iſtam in Eccleſia invexere, quaſi nullis Regum teneatur vinculis; quaſi neque parere debeat Concilio Pontifex: nec ab eo judicare queat.</hi> The <hi>Kings</hi> themſelves alſo befreind their <hi>Clergy</hi> in this Cauſe, and therefore not onely proteſted againſt the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> wherein the ſpiritual tyranny was generally conſented to by the <hi>Catholike</hi> facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond alſo would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to be a <hi>Council,</hi> calling them in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by no other name than <hi>Conventus Tridenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>: An indignity which the, <hi>Fathers</hi> took very offenſively.</p>
               <p>Put the principal thing, in which it behooveth them not to acknowledge his ſpiritual ſupremacy is the Collation of <hi>Benefices</hi> and <hi>Biſhopricks,</hi> and the <hi>Annates</hi> and firſt fruits thence ariſing. The firſt and greateſt controverſie between the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> was about the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Livings of the Church, and giving the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture unto <hi>Biſhops.</hi> The <hi>Popes</hi> had long thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted after that authority, as being a great meanes to advance their followers, and eſtabliſh their own greatneſs; for which cauſe, in divers petty <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,</hi> the receiving of any <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> preferment of a <hi>Lay-man</hi> was decreed to be <hi>Simony.</hi> But this did little edifie with ſuch patrons as had good Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings: As ſoon as ever <hi>Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54835:95"/>
effect the buſineſs as well in <hi>Germany</hi> now he was <hi>Pope,</hi> as he had done in <hi>France</hi> whilſt he was <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi> He commandeth therefore <hi>Henry</hi> the third <hi>Emperour: Ne deinceps Epiſcopatus &amp; Beneficia</hi> (they are <hi>Platina</hi>'s own words) <hi>per cupiditatem Simoniacam committat, aliter ſe uſurum in ipſum cenſuris Eccleſiaſticis.</hi> To this injuſtice when the <hi>Emperour</hi> would not yeild, he called a ſolemn <hi>Council</hi> at the <hi>Lateran,</hi> where the <hi>Emperour</hi> was pronounced to be <hi>Simoniacal,</hi> and afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated: Neither would this <hi>Tyrant</hi> ever leave perſecuting of him till he had laid him in his grave. After this followed great ſtrugling between the <hi>Popes</hi> and the <hi>Emperours</hi> for this very matter; but in the end the <hi>Popes</hi> got the victory. In <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> here, he that firſt bickered about it was <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Rufus,</hi> the controverſie being, whether he or <hi>Pope <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> ſhould inveſt <hi>Anſelme Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury. Anſelme</hi> would receive his inveſtiture of none but the <hi>Pope</hi>; whereupon the <hi>King</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him the Realm, into which he was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted till the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond. He to endear himſelf with his <hi>Clergy</hi> relinquiſhed his right to the <hi>Pope</hi>; but afterwards repenting himſelf of it, he revoked his grant. Neither did the <hi>Engliſh Kings</hi> wholly looſe it, till the raign of that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Prince <hi>King John, Edward</hi> the firſt again recovered it, and his Succeſſors kept it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Popes</hi> having with much violence and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition wreſted into their hands this Priviledge, of nominating <hi>Prieſts</hi> and inveſting <hi>Biſhops,</hi> they ſpared not to lay on what taxes they pleaſed; as on the <hi>Benefices, Firſt fruits, Penſions, Subſidies,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54835:96"/>
Fifteenths, Tenths</hi>; and on the <hi>Biſhopricks,</hi> for <hi>Palls, Mitres, Croſiers, Rings,</hi> and I know not what bables. By theſe means the Churches were ſo impoveriſhed; that upon complaint made unto the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Baſel,</hi> all theſe cheating tricks, theſe <hi>aucupia &amp; eapilandi rationes,</hi> were aboliſhed. This <hi>Decree</hi> was called <hi>Pragmatica ſanctio,</hi> and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh, <hi>Anno</hi> 1438. An act of ſingular improvement to the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> which yearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the Court of Parliament manifeſted to <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh had drained the State of a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Crowns. Since which time the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> have ſometimes omitted the vigour of the <hi>Sanction,</hi> and ſometimes alſo exacted it, according as their affairs with the <hi>Pope</hi> ſtood: for which cauſe it was called, <hi>fraenum pontificum:</hi> At the laſt <hi>King Francis</hi> the firſt having conquered <hi>Millain,</hi> fell unto this compoſition with his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> namely, that upon the falling of any <hi>Abbacie</hi> or <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> the <hi>King</hi> ſhould have ſix moneths time to preſent a fit man unto him, whom the <hi>Pope</hi> legally might inveſt: If the <hi>King</hi> neglected his time limited, the <hi>Pope</hi> might take the benefit of the relapſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute whom he pleaſed. So is it alſo with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior benifices between the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Patrons</hi>; inſomuch that any or every <hi>Lay-patron</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> together in <hi>England,</hi> hath for ought I ſee (at the leaſt in this particular) as great a ſpiritual ſupremacy as the <hi>Pope</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay to proceed further, and to ſhew how meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly titular both his ſupremacies are, as well the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> as the <hi>temporal,</hi> you may plainly ſee in the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54835:96"/>
caſe of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was thus. In the year 1609. the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> had obtained of <hi>King Henry</hi> the fourth licenſe to read again in their Colledge of <hi>Paris:</hi> but when their Letters Patents came to be verified in the Court of Parliament, the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity</hi> oppoſed them. On the ſeventeenth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, Anno</hi> 1611. both parties came to have an hearing; and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> got the day, unleſs the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> would ſubſcribe unto theſe four points: <hi>Viz.</hi> Firſt, that the <hi>Council</hi> was above the <hi>Pope.</hi> Secondly, that the <hi>Pope</hi> had not temporal power over <hi>Kings,</hi> and could not by Excommunication deprive them of their Realms and Eſtates. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Clergy men having heard of any attempt or conſpiracy againſt the King, or his Realm, or any matter of treaſon in Confeſſion, they were bound to reveal it. And fourthly, that Clergy men were ſubject to the <hi>Secular Prince,</hi> or <hi>Politick Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</hi> It appeared by our former diſcourſe, what title, or no power, they had left the <hi>Pope</hi> over the eſtates and preferments of the <hi>French.</hi> By theſe propoſitions (to which the <hi>Juſuits</hi> in the end ſubſcribed, I know not with what mental reſervation) it is more than evident, that they have left him no command, neither over their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences nor their perſons. So that all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, we may juſtly ſay of the Papal power in <hi>France,</hi> what the <hi>Papiſts</hi> falſly ſay of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> namely, that it is <hi>Nomen ſine rebus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In one thing onely his authority here is entire, which is his immediate protection of all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Friers,</hi> and alſo a <hi>ſuperintendency</hi> or ſupreme eye over the <hi>Monks,</hi> who acknowledge very ſmall
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54835:97"/>
obedience, if any at all, to the <hi>French Biſhops.</hi> For though at the beginning every part and member of the <hi>Dioceſs</hi> was directly under the care and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Biſhop</hi>; yet it ſo happened at the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Moneſtaries</hi> in the <hi>Weſtern Church,</hi> the <hi>Abbots</hi> being men of good parts and ſincere life, grew much into the envy of their <hi>Dioceſan.</hi> For which cauſe, as alſo to be more at their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they made ſuit to the <hi>Pope,</hi> that they might be freed from that ſubjection: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tque intutelam Dive Petri admitterentur.</hi> A propoſition very plauſible to his <hi>Holineſs</hi> ambition, which by this meanes might the ſooner be raiſed to his height, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without difficulty granted: This gap opened, firſt the ſeveral Orders of <hi>Friers,</hi> and after them the <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters</hi> purchaſed to themſelves the like exemptions. In this the <hi>Popes</hi> power was wonderfully ſtrengthened, in having ſuch able and ſo many props to uphold his authority; it being a true <hi>Maxime</hi> in State, <hi>Quod qui privilegia obtenent, ad eadem conſervanda, teneantur authoritatem conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentis tueri.</hi> This continued till the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> unqueſtioned, where the <hi>Biſhops</hi> much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of their want of authority, and imputed all the ſchiſmes and vices in the Church to this, that their hands were tied. Hereupon the <hi>Popes Legates</hi> thought it fit to reſtore to their juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters:</hi> At that of the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Moneſtaries</hi> they were more ſticking: till at the laſt <hi>Sebaſtian Pighinus</hi> one of the <hi>Popes</hi> Officers found out for them this ſatisfaction, that they ſhould have an eye and inſpection into the lives of the <hi>Monks,</hi> not by any authority of their
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54835:97"/>
own, <hi>Sed tanquam a ſede Apoſtolica delegati.</hi> But as for the Orders of <hi>Friers,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> would not by any means give way unto it. They are his <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries,</hi> and the ſtrongeſt bulwarks of his Empire, and are therefore called in a good Author, <hi>Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia Romanae Curiae inſtrumenta.</hi> So that with them the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> hath nothing to do; each ſeverall religious Houſe being as a Court of <hi>Peculiars,</hi> ſubject onely to the great Metropolitan of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This near dependance on his <hi>Holineſs</hi> maketh this generation a great deal more regardleſs of their behaviour than otherwiſe it would be, though ſince the growth of the reformation, ſhame and fear hath much reformed them. They have ſtill how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a ſpice of their former wantonneſs, and on occaſions will permit themſelves a little good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip. And to ſay truth of them, I think them to be the beſt Companions in <hi>France</hi> for a journey, but not for acquaintance. They live very merrily, and keep a competent table, more I ſuppoſe than can ſtand with their vow, and yet far ſhort of that affluency whereof many of our books accuſe them. It was my chance to be in an houſe of the <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> where one of the <hi>Friers,</hi> upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of our Friend, had us into the Hall, it being then the time of their Refectory, a favour not vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. There ſaw we the Brothers ſitting all on a ſide, and every one a pretty diſtance from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; their ſeveral commons being a diſh of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, a chop of mutton, a diſh of Cherries, and a large glaſs of water. This proviſion, together with a liberal allowance of eaſe, and a little of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54835:98"/>
keepeth them exceeding plump and in good liking, and maketh them, having little to take thought for, maketh them (as I ſaid before) paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing good Company. As I travelled to <hi>Orleans</hi> we had in coach with us three of theſe mortified ſinners; two of the Order of <hi>St. Auſtin,</hi> and one <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> the merrieſt Crickets that ever chirped. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them but mad tricks and complements, and for muſick they would ſing like Hawks; when we came to a vein of good Wine, they would chear up themſelves and their neighbour with this comfortable doctrine, <hi>Vivamus ut bibamus, et bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bamus ut vivamus</hi>: and for Courtſhip, and toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>Wenches,</hi> you would eaſily beleeve it had been a trade, with which they had not a little been acquainted.

               <p>On the other ſide the common Prieſts of <hi>France</hi> are ſo dull and blockiſh, that you ſhall hardly meet with a more contemptible people. The meaneſt of our <hi>Curats</hi> in <hi>England</hi> for ſpirit and diſcourſe are very <hi>Popes</hi> to them: for learning they may ſafely ſay with <hi>Socrates, Hoc tantum ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, quod neſcimus</hi>: but you muſt not look that they ſhould ſay it in Latine. Tongues they have none but thoſe of their <hi>Mother</hi> and the <hi>Maſſe Book</hi>; of which laſt they can make no uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſs the Book be open, and then alſo the Book is fain to read it ſelf: for in the laſt <hi>Romanum Miſſale,</hi> eſtabliſhed by the authority of <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, and recognized by <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1600.

every ſillable is diverſly marked, whether it muſt be ſounded long or ſhort; juſt as the varifying examples are in the end of the <hi>Engliſh Grammer.</hi> When I had loſt my ſelf in the ſtreets of <hi>Paris,</hi> and wanted <hi>French</hi> to enquire homeward, I uſed to apply my ſelf to ſome of this reverend habit: But <hi>O ſoeclum inſipiens et infacitum</hi>; you might as eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have wrought water out of the flint, as a word of <hi>Latine</hi> out of their mouthes. Nor is this the diſeaſe of the vulgar <hi>Maſſe mumbler</hi> onely, it hath alſo infected the right worſhipful of the Clergy:</p>
               <p>In <hi>Orleans</hi> I had buſineſs with a <hi>Chanoin</hi> of the Church of <hi>St. Croiz,</hi> a fellow that wore his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice (it was made of Lawne and Lace) with as good a credit as ever I ſaw any; and for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and capacity of his cap, he might have been a <hi>Metropolitan</hi>: perceiving me to ſpeak to him in a ſtrange Tongue (for it was <hi>Latine</hi>) he very learnedly asked me this queſtion; <hi>Num poteſtis loqui Gallica</hi>? which when I had denied, at laſt he brake out into another Interrogatory: <hi>viz. Quandiu fuiſtis in Gallice.</hi> To conclude having read over my Letter, with two or three deadly pangs, and ſix times rubbing of his temples, he diſmiſſed me with this cordial; and truly it was very comfortable to my humor. <hi>Ego necotias veſtras curabo.</hi> A ſtrange beaſt and one of the greateſt prodigies of Ignorance, that ever I met with in mans apparrel.</p>
               <p>Such being the <hi>Romiſh Prieſts,</hi> it is no marvail if the <hi>French</hi> be no more ſetled and reſolute in their Religion. If the eye be blind, the body cannot chuſe but be darkned: and certainly there
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54835:99"/>
is nothing that hath prepared many of this Realm more to embrace the reformation, than this block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of their own Clergy: an excellent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the <hi>Proteſtant Miniſters,</hi> could they but well humor it; and likely to be a fair inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their party, if well husbanded. Beſides this the <hi>French Catholicks</hi> are not over earneſt in their cauſe, and ſo do lye open to the aſſaults of any politick enemy; to deal with them by main force of argument, and in the ſervent ſpirit of zeal (as the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> too often do) is not the way: Men uncapable of oppoſition (as this people generally are) and furious, if once thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, muſt be tamed as <hi>Alexander</hi> did his Horſe <hi>Bucephalus.</hi> Thoſe that came to back him with the tyranny of the ſpur and a cudgel, he quickly threw down, and miſchieved; <hi>Alexander</hi> came otherwiſe prepared, for turning his Horſe toward the Sun, that he might not ſee the impatiency of his ſhadow, he ſpake kindly to him, and gently clapping him on the back, till he had left his flinging and wildneſs, he lightly leapeth into the ſaddle, the Horſe never making reſiſtance. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> in his life relateth the ſtorie, and this the <hi>Morall</hi> of it.</p>

With theſe verſes I take my leave of his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> wiſhing none of his ſucceſſors would preſage worſe luck unto <hi>England</hi>: I go now to ſee his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> to whoſe houſe the ſame <hi>Engliſh Catholike</hi> brought me, but he was not at home, his name is <hi>Ferdinando d' Eſpado</hi>; a man (as he informed me) able to diſcharge the truſt repoſed in him by his Maſter, and one that very well affecteth the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nation He hath the faireſt <hi>Egliſe,</hi> and keepeth the largeſt retinue of any ordinary <hi>Embaſſadour</hi> in the Realm, and maketh good his Maſters ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by his own precedency. To honour him, againſt he was to take this charge, his Holineſs created him <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Damiata</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> A place, which I am certain never any of them ſaw but in a <hi>Map</hi>; and for the profits he receiveth thence, they will
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54835:101"/>
never be able to pay for his <hi>Croſier.</hi> But this is one of his <hi>Holineſs</hi> uſual policies, to ſatisfie his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers with empty titles. So he made <hi>Biſhop</hi> whom he ſent to govern for him in <hi>England</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi>: and <hi>Smith</hi> alſo, who is come over about the ſame buſineſs with the <hi>Queen, Biſhop of Archidala</hi> a City of <hi>Thrace.</hi> An old <hi>Engliſh Doctor</hi> uſed it as an eſpecial argument, to prove the Univerſality of power in the <hi>Pope,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could ordain <hi>Biſhops</hi> over all Cities in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> If he could as eaſily alſo give them the revenue; this reaſon I confeſs would much ſway me, till then I am ſorry, that men ſhould ſtill be boyes and play with bubbles: By the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he might do well, to make all his Courtiers <hi>Kings,</hi> and he were ſure to have a moſt Royal and beggerly <hi>Court</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>To proceed a little further in the <hi>Allegory</hi>: ſo it is, that when <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw <hi>Eſau</hi> to have incurred his Fathers and Mothers anger, for his heatheniſh marriage; he ſet himſelf to bereave his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his bleſſing: prayers and the ſweet ſmell of his Veniſon, the ſweet ſmelling of his ſacrifices obtained of his <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> a bleſſing for him, for indeed the <hi>Lord</hi> hath given unto this his <hi>French Jacob,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Text: The dew of heaven and the fatneſs of the earth, and plenty of corn and Wine</hi> Gen. 27. 5, 28. It followeth in the 41. ver. of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>And</hi> Eſau <hi>hated</hi> Jacob, <hi>becauſe of the bleſſing wherewith his Father had bleſſed him: and</hi> Eſau <hi>ſaid in his heart, the dayes of mourning for my Father are at hand, then will I ſlay my brother</hi> Jacob: The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of which his bloudy reſolution was, that <hi>Jacob</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:54835:102"/>
was fain to relinquiſh all that he had and fly unto his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle.</hi> This laſt ſtory expreſſeth very much of the eſtate of the <hi>French</hi> Church. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to ſee them thrive and encreaſe ſo much amongſt them; this hatred moved them to a war, by which they hoped to root them out all together; and this war compelled the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to abandon their good Towns, and ſtrong Holds, and all their poſſeſſions, and to fly unto their friends whereſoever they could find them. And indeed the preſent eſtate of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> is not much better than that of <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> nor much different; the bleſſing which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, lyeth more in the ſeed than in the harveſt, and well may they hope to be reſtored to the love and boſome of their brethren, of which as yet they have no aſſurance: For their ſtrength it conſiſteth principally in their <hi>prayers to God</hi>; and ſecondly, in their obedience to their <hi>King</hi>: Within theſe two Fortreſſes, if they can keep themſelves, they need fear none ill, becauſe they ſhall deſerve none. The onely outward ſtrengths they have left them, are the two Towns of <hi>Moutabon</hi> and <hi>Rochell</hi>; the one deemed invincible, the other threatned a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy deſtruction. The <hi>Duke of Eſpernon</hi> (at my being there) lay round about it, and it was ſaid, that the Town was in very bad terms; all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Townes, to whoſe oppoſition they moſt truſted, having yeilded at the firſt ſight of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. <hi>Rochell</hi> its thought cannot be forced by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, nor compelled by a famine; ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are glad of it, and hope to ſee the <hi>French</hi> Church reſtored to its former powerableneſs, by the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54835:102"/>
of that Town meerly: I rather think, that the perverſe and ſtubborn condition of it will at laſt drive the young <hi>King</hi> into a fury, and incite him to revenge their contradiction on their innocent Friends, now diſarmed and diſabled. Then will they ſee at laſt the iſſue of their own peremptory reſolutions, and begin to beleive, that the Heathen <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> was of the two the better <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> when he gave us this note. <hi>Non turpe eſt ab eo vinci, quem vincere eſſet nefas, neque illi, in honeſte etiam ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitti, quem fortuna ſuper omnes extuliſſet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This weakneſs and miſery which hath now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> was an effect, I confeſs, of the ill will which the other party bare them; but that they bare them ill will, was a fruit of their own grafting. In this circumſtance they were nothing like <hi>Jacob,</hi> who in the hatred, which his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> had to him, was meerly paſſive. They being active alſo in the birth of it. And indeed the lamentable and bloudy war which fell upon them, they not onely endeavoured not to avoid, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited. During the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, who would not ſee it, and the troubleſome minority of <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth. who could not moleſt them, they had made themſelves maſters of ninety nine Towns, well fortified and enabled for a ſiege. A ſtrength too great for any one faction to keep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under a <hi>King</hi> which deſires to be himſelf and so rule his people. In the opinion of their potency they call Aſſemblies, Parliaments, as it were, when and as often as they pleaſed. There they conſulted of the common affairs of Religion, made new Laws of government, removed and exchanged their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54835:103"/>
Officers, the <hi>Kings</hi> leave all this while never ſo much as formally asked. Had they onely been guilty of too much power, that crime alone had been ſufficient to have raiſed a war againſt them, it not ſtanding with the ſafety and honour of a <hi>King,</hi> not to be the abſolute commander of his own ſubjects. But in this their licentious calling of Aſſemblies, they abuſed their power into a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and in not diſſolving them at his Majeſties commandement, they increaſed their neglect into a diſobedience. The Aſſembly which principally the war and their ruine, was that of <hi>Rochell,</hi> called by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> preſently upon the <hi>Kings</hi> journey into <hi>Bearne.</hi> This general meeting the <hi>King</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by his eſpecial Edicts: declaring all them to be guilty of treaſon, which notwithſtanding, they would not hearken to, but very undutifully went on in their purpoſes: It was ſaid by a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of that party, and one that had been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in many of their affairs, that the very zeal of ſome who had the guiding of their conſciences, had thruſted them into thoſe deſperate courſes, and I beleive him.</p>

In their Aſſembly therefore they make Laws and Orders to regulate their diſobedience; as that no peace ſhould be made without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the general Convocation, about paying of the Souldiers wages, for the detaining of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and the like.

               <p>Thus we ſee the <hi>Kings</hi> Army levied upon no ſleight grounds. His regal authority was neglected, his eſpecial Edicts violated, his gratious proffers ſlighted, his revenues forbidden him, and his Realm divided before his face, and alotted unto Officers not of his own election.

But the calamities which befel the men were mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and ſparing, if compared with thoſe which the women ſuffered: when the Souldiers had made

them the Subjects of their luſt, they made them after the ſubjects of their fury; in that onely pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to that poor and diſtreſſed Sex, that they did not let them ſurvive their honours. Such of them, who out of fear and faintneſs had made but little reſiſtance, had the favour to be ſtabbed; but thoſe, whoſe virtue and courage maintained their bodies valiantly from the rape of thoſe villains, had the ſecrets of Nature (<hi>Procul hinc eſte caſt ae miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des aures</hi>) filled with Gun-powder, and ſo blown into aſhes.

It is ſaid, that the <hi>King</hi> was ignorant of this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs, and offended at it: Offended, I perſwade my ſelf, he could not but be, unleſs he had totally put off himſelf and degenerated into a <hi>Tyger</hi>: but for his ignorance, I dare not conceive it to be any other than that of <hi>Nero,</hi> an ignorance rather in his eye than in his underſtanding. <hi>Subduxit oculos Nero</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tacitus) juſſitque ſcelera, non ſpectavit.</hi>

               <p>Though the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> deſerved affliction for their diſobedience, yet this was an execution above the nature of a puniſhment, a miſery beyond the condition of the crime. True it is, and I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acquit them of it, that in the time of their proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity they had done the <hi>King</hi> many affronts, and committed many acts of diſobedience and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, which juſtly occaſioned the warr againſt them.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54835:105"/>
whereof ſeemed to have been their onely petition. The <hi>King</hi> by his <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Pacification</hi> had licenſed the free exerciſe of both Religions, and thereupon permitted the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites</hi> to preach in the Towns of <hi>Caution,</hi> being then in the hands of the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> On the other ſide, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> aſſembled at <hi>Loudan,</hi> ſtraitly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all their Governours, Mayors, and Sheriffs, not to ſuffer any <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> or any of any other Order, to preach in their Towns, although licenſed by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the <hi>Dioceſs:</hi> When upon diſlike of their proceedings in that Aſſembly, the <hi>King</hi> had declared their meetings to be unlawful, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his peace, and this Declaration was verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them by the Parliament; they notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding would not ſeparate themſelves, but ſtood ſtill upon terms of capitulation, and the juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of their action. Again, whereas it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Privas,</hi> Town full of thoſe of the Religion, dyed in the year 1620. and left his Daughter and Heir in the bed and marriage of the <hi>Viſcount</hi> of <hi>Cheylane</hi> a Catholike; this new Lord, according to law and right, in his own Town changed the former Garriſon, putting his own ſervants and dependants in their places. Upon this the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the Town and Country about it, draw themſelves in Troops, ſurprize many of the Towns about it, and at the laſt compelled the young Gentleman to fly from his inheritance; an action which jumping even with the time of the Aſſembly at <hi>Rochell,</hi> made the <hi>King</hi> more doubtful of their ſincerity. I could add to theſe divers others of their undutiful practiſes, being the

effects of too much felicity, and of a fortune which they could not govern. <hi>Atqui animus meminiſſe horret, luctu<expan>

               <p>Theſe their inſolencies and unruly acts of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience made the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Council</hi> ſuſpect that their deſigns tended further than Religion; and that their purpoſe might be to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a free Eſtate, after the example of <hi>Geneva</hi> and the <hi>Low Country-men.</hi> The late power which they had taken of calling their own <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Convocations,</hi> was a ſtrong argument of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: ſo alſo was the intelligence which they held with thoſe of their faith at the <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Sappe,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the permiſſion of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth on the firſt of <hi>October, Anno</hi> 1603. They not onely gave audience to Ambaſſadours, and received Letters from forrain Princes, but alſo importuned his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to have a general liberty of going into any other Countreys, and aſſigning at their Counſel a matter of eſpecial importance. And therefore the <hi>King</hi> upon a foreſight of the dangers, wiſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited them to go to any Aſſemblies without a particular licence, upon pain to be declared Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Since that time growing into greater ſtrength, whenſoever they had occaſion of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with <hi>King Lewis,</hi> they would never treat with him but by their <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> and upon eſpecial Articles. An ambition above the quality of thoſe that profeſs themſelves <hi>Sorbonets,</hi> and the onely way, as <hi>Du Seirres</hi> noteth, to make an eſtate in the <hi>State</hi>: but the anſwers made unto the <hi>King</hi> by thoſe of <hi>Alerack</hi> and <hi>Montanbon</hi> are pregnant proofs of their intent and meaning in this kind.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54835:106"/>
The firſt, being ſummoned by the <hi>King</hi> and his Army the 22. of <hi>July, Anno</hi> 1621. returned thus, that the <hi>King</hi> ſhould ſuffer them to enjoy their liberties, and leave their fortifications as they were for them of their lives, and ſo they would declare themſelves to be his ſubjects. They of <hi>Montan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> made a fuller expreſſion of the general deſign <hi>Diſobedience</hi>; which was, that they were reſolved to live and die in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of the Churches: had they ſaid, for the <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> it had been ſpoken bravely, but now rebelliouſly.</p>
               <p>This union and confederacy of theirs <hi>King Lewis</hi> uſed to call, <hi>the Common-wealth of Rochell</hi>; for the overthrow of which he alwayes proteſted that he had onely taken Arms: and if we compare circumſtances, we ſhall find it to be no other. In the ſecond of <hi>April,</hi> before he had as yet advanced into the Feild, he publiſhed a <hi>Declaration</hi> in favour of all thoſe of the Religion, which would contain themſelves within duty and obedience. And whereas ſome of <hi>Tours</hi> at the beginning of the warrs had tumultuouſly moleſted the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> at the burial of one of their dead, five of them by the <hi>Kings</hi> eſpecial commandement were openly executed: When the warr was hotteſt abroad, thoſe of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> lived as ſecurely as ever, and had their accuſtomed meetings at <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentan.</hi> So had thoſe alſo of other places. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over when tidings came to <hi>Paris</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Mayens</hi> death ſlain before <hi>Montanbon,</hi> the <hi>Raſcal French,</hi> according to their hot headed diſpoſitions, breathed out nothing but ruine to the <hi>Hugonots</hi>; the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Montbazon,</hi> Governour of the City,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54835:106"/>
commanded their houſes and the ſtreets to be ſafely guarded. After when this Rabble had burnt down their Temple at <hi>Charentan,</hi> the Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> on the day following ordained, that it ſhould be built up again in a more beautiful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that at the <hi>Kings</hi> charge. Add to this, that ſince the ending of the warrs, and the reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of almoſt all their Towns, we have not ſeen the leaſt alteration of Religion. Beſides that, they have been permitted to hold a National <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Clarenton</hi> for eſtabliſhing the truth of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, againſt the errors of <hi>Arminius</hi> Profeſſor of <hi>Leiden</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi>

               <p>All things thus conſidered in their true being, I cannot ſee for what cauſe our late Soveraign ſhould ſuffer ſo much envy as he did, for not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them aſſiſtance. I cannot but ſay, that my ſelf hath too often condemned his remiſsneſs in that cauſe, which upon better conſideration I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how he ſhould have dealt in. Had he been a meddler in it further than he was, he had not ſo much preſerved Religion as ſupported rebellion; beſides the conſequence of the example. To have aſſiſted the diſobedient <hi>French,</hi> under the colour of the liberty of Conſcience, had been onely to have taught that <hi>King</hi> a way into <hi>England</hi> upon the ſame pretence, and to have troad the path of his own hazard. Further, he had not long before denyed ſuccor to his own children, when he might have given upon a better ground, and for a fairer purpoſe; and could not now in honour counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the like action in another: For that other denial of his helping hand, I much doubt how farre
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54835:107"/>
poſterity will acquit him, though certainly he was a good Prince, and had been an happy inſtrument of the peace of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> had not the later part of his raign happened in a time ſo full of troubles. So that betwixt the quietneſs of his nature, and the turbulencies of his later dayes, he fell into that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable exigent mentioned in the <hi>Hiſtorian: Miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimum eſt cum alicui aut natura ſua excedenda eſt, aut minuenda dignitas.</hi> Add to this, that the <hi>French</hi> had firſt been abandoned at home by their own friends: of ſeven Generals, whom they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ſeven circles into which they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all <hi>France,</hi> four of them never giving them incouragement. The three which accepted of thoſe inordinate Governments, were the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Rohan</hi> his Brother Mr. <hi>Sonbiſe,</hi> and the <hi>Marqueſs la Force</hi>: the four others being the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moville,</hi> the <hi>Earl of Chaſtillon,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Leſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guier,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bovillon,</hi> who ſhould have commanded in cheif: So that the <hi>French Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> cannot ſay, that he was firſt wanting unto them, but they to themſelves. If we demand what ſhould move the <hi>French Proteſtants</hi> to this rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious contradiction of his Majeſties commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we muſt anſwer, that it was too much happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>Cauſa hujus belli eadem, quae omnium nimid faelicitas</hi>: as <hi>Florus</hi> of the Civil warrs between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey.</hi> Before the year 1620. when they fell firſt into the <hi>Kings</hi> diſ-favour, they were poſſeſſed of almoſt an hundred good Towns well fortified for their ſafety, beſides beautiful houſes and ample poſſeſſions in the Villages. They ſlept every man under his own Vine, and his own Fig-tree,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54835:107"/>
neither fearing nor needing to fear the leaſt diſturbance with thoſe of the Catholike party; they were grown ſo intimate and entire by reaſon of their inter-marriages, that a very few years would have made them incorporated, if not into one faith, yet into one family: For their better ſatisfaction in matters of Juſtice, it pleaſed <hi>King Henry</hi> the fourth to erect a chamber in the Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> purpoſely for them. It conſiſted of one <hi>Preſident</hi> and ſixteen <hi>Counſellors</hi>; their office, to take knowledge of all the Cauſes and Suits of them of the Reformed Religion, as well within the juriſdiction of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Brittain,</hi> till there ſhould be a Chamber erected in either of them. There were appointed alſo two Chambers in the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and <hi>Grenoble,</hi> and one at <hi>Chaſters</hi> for the <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Tholoza.</hi> Theſe Chambers were called, <hi>Les Chambres de l' Edict,</hi> becauſe they were eſtabliſhed by a ſpecial <hi>Edict</hi> at the Town of <hi>Nantes</hi> in <hi>Brittain, April</hi> the eighth; <hi>Anno</hi> 1598. In a word, they lived ſo ſecure and happy, that one would have thought their felicities had been immortal.

It is well yet, that there are ſome amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which will commend grapes though they cannot reach them: This Competency may come to forty or fifty pound yearly or a little more. <hi>Beza</hi> that great and famous Preacher of <hi>Geneva</hi> had but eighty pound a year, and about that rate was <hi>Peter du Moulins</hi> penſion, when he preached at <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> Theſe ſtipends are partly paid by the <hi>King,</hi> and partly raiſed by way of Collection. So the Miniſters of thoſe Churches are much of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Engliſh Lecturers.</hi> As for the Tythes, they belong to the ſeveral Pariſh Prieſts in whoſe precincts they are due: and thoſe, I warrant you, according to the little learning which they have, will hold them to be <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> The Sermons of the <hi>French</hi> are very plain home-ſpun, little in them of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and leſs of humane learning: it being concluded in the <hi>Synode</hi> of <hi>Sappe,</hi> that onely the <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſhould be uſed in their Pulpits; they conſiſt much of exhortation and uſe, and of

The inequality between the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Nobles and Commons in <hi>France.</hi> The Kings power how much reſpected by the Princes: The powerableneſs of that rank: The form of Execution done on them: The muititude and confuſion of Nobility.

               </argument>
               <p>HAving thus ſpoken of the Church, I muſt now treat a little of the Common-wealth. Religion is as the ſoul of a <hi>State,</hi> policy as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; we can hardly diſcourſe of the one, without a relation to the other; if we do, We commit a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful murder in the deſtroying a <hi>Republick.</hi> The Common-wealth without the Church is but a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs or thing inanimate: The Church without the Common-wealth is as it were, <hi>anima ſeparata.</hi> The joyning of them together maketh of both one flouriſhing and permanent body: and therefore as they are in nature, ſo in my relations, <hi>Connubio jungam ſtabili.</hi> Moreover ſuch a ſecret ſimpathy there is between them; ſuch a neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of one upon the other, that we may ſay of them what <hi>Tullie</hi> doth of two Twinns in his book <hi>de Fato Eorum morbus eodem tempore graveſcit, &amp; eodem levatur.</hi> They grow ſick and well at the ſame time, and commonly run out of their race at the ſame inſtant. There is beſides the general reſpects each to other, a more particular bond betwixt them here in <hi>France,</hi> which is a likeneſs and reſemblance in the Church of <hi>France.</hi> We have found a <hi>Head</hi> and a <hi>Body.</hi> This <hi>Body</hi> again divided into two parts, the <hi>Catholike</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> The <hi>Head</hi> is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54835:111"/>
in his own opinion and the minds of many others, of a power unlimited; yet the Catholike party hath ſtrongly curbed it: And of the two parts of the body, we ſee the <hi>Papiſts</hi> flouriſhing and in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, whilſt that of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> is in miſery and affliction. Thus it is alſo in the <hi>Body Politick,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> in his own Conceit boundleſs and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, is yet affronted by his <hi>Nobles</hi>: which <hi>Nobles</hi> enjoy all freedom of riches and happineſs; the poor <hi>Peſants</hi> in the mean time living in drudgery and bondage.</p>
               <p>For the government of the <hi>King</hi> is meerly <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi> or to give it the right name, <hi>Deſpotical</hi>: Though the Country be his Wife, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are his Children, yet doth he neither govern as a Husband or a Father: He accounteth of them all as of his ſervants, and therefore commandeth them as a Maſter. In his <hi>Edicts,</hi> which he over-frequently ſendeth about, he never mentioned the good will of his Subjects, nor the approbation of his Council, but concludeth all of them in this form, <hi>Cartel eſt noſtre plaiſir: ſic volo, ſic jubeo.</hi> A form of government very prone to degenerate into Tyranny, if the <hi>Princes</hi> had not oftentimes ſtrength and will to make reſiſtance. But this not the vice of the entire and Soveraign Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy alone, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: the other two good forms of regiment being ſubject alſo to the ſame frailty. Thus in the reading of Hiſtories have we obſerved an <hi>Ariſtocracie</hi> to have been frequently corrupted into an <hi>Oligarchie</hi>: and <hi>Politeia</hi> (or Common-wealth properly ſo called) into a <hi>Democracie.</hi> For as in the body
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54835:111"/>
natural the pureſt Complexions are leſs laſting, and eaſily broken, and ſubject to alteration. So it is in the body <hi>Civil:</hi> The pure and unmixt forms of government, though perfect &amp; abſolute in their kinds, are of little continuance, and very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to change into its oppoſite. They therefore which have written of <hi>Republicks</hi> do moſt applaud and commend the mixt manner of Rule, which is equally compounded of the Kingdom and <hi>Politeia,</hi> becauſe in them <hi>Kings</hi> have all the power belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their title, without prejudice to the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In theſe there is reſerved to the <hi>King</hi> abſolute Majeſty, to the <hi>Nobles</hi> convenient authority, to the people an incorrupted liberty, all in a juſt and equal proportion. Every one of theſe is like the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was moderated by <hi>Nerva. Qui res olim diſſociabiles miſcuerat principatum &amp; libertatem</hi>: wherein the ſoveraignty of one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaged not the freedom of all. A rare mixture of government. And ſuch is the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> A Kingdom of a perfect and happy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, wherein the <hi>King</hi> hath his full preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the <hi>Nobles</hi> all due reſpects, and the <hi>People</hi> amongſt other bleſſings perfect in this, that they are maſters of their own purſes, and have a ſtrong hand in the making of their own Lawes.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, in the <hi>Regal</hi> government of <hi>France,</hi> the Subject frameth his life meerly as the <hi>Kings</hi> variable <hi>Edicts</hi> ſhall pleaſe to enjoyn him, is baniſht of his money as the <hi>Kings</hi> task-maſters think fit, and ſuffereth many other oppreſſions, which in their proper place ſhall be ſpecified.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Such an Empire, by which a <hi>Prince</hi> may command, and do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall ſeem good in his own eyes, one of the Prerogatives <hi>Royall</hi> of the <hi>French Kings.</hi> For though the Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> doth ſeem to challenge a peruſal of his <hi>Edicts</hi> before they paſs for Laws, yet is this but a meer formality: It is the <hi>Cartell eſt noſtre plaiſir,</hi> which maketh them currant, which it ſeemeth theſe <hi>Princes</hi> learned of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperours, Juſtinian</hi> in the book of <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi> maketh five parts of the Civil Lawes: <hi>Viz.</hi> (He meaneth the Law of the twelve Tables:) <hi>Plebiſcita, Senatus conſulta, Prudentum reſponſa,</hi> and <hi>Principum placita</hi>: To this laſt he addeth this general ſtrength, <hi>Quod principi placuerit legis habet valorem</hi>: The very foundation of the <hi>Kings</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfulneſs. True it is yet, that the Courts of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> do uſe to demurre ſometimes upon his <hi>Patents</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> and to petition him for a Reverſal of them: but his anſwer commonly is, <hi>Stat pro ratione Voluntas.</hi> He knoweth his own power, and granteth <hi>Letters Patents</hi> for new Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Monopolies abundantly. If a moneyed man can make a friend in Court, he may have an Office found for him, of ſix pence upon every Sword made in <hi>France</hi>: a <hi>liure</hi> upon the ſelling of every head of Cattel: a brace of <hi>ſoles</hi> for every pair of boots, and the like. It is the onely ſtudy of ſome men, to find out ſuch devices of enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves and undoing the people. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54835:112"/>
for <hi>Mines</hi> granted to <hi>Sir Giles Mompeſſon,</hi> was juſt one of the <hi>French</hi> Offices. As for <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies,</hi> they are here ſo common, that the Subject taketh no notice of it, not a ſcurvy petty book being printed, but it hath its priviledge affixed, <hi>ad imprimendum ſolum.</hi> Theſe being granted by the <hi>King,</hi> are carried to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> by them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally peruſed, and finally verified: after which they are in force and vertue againſt all oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid in <hi>France,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Luines</hi> had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Patent</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> for a <hi>quart d' Eſcu</hi> to be paid unto him for the Chriſtning of every Child throughout the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> A very unjuſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable extortion: Had he lived to have preſented it to the Court, I much doubt of their denial, though the onely cauſe of bringing before them ſuch <hi>Patents,</hi> is onely intended, that they ſhould diſcuſs the juſtice and convenience of them.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath a formality of power left in them of verifying the <hi>Kings Edicts,</hi> his grants of Offices and <hi>Monopolies</hi>; ſo hath the Chamber of Accompts, a ſuperficial ſurvey of his gifts and expences: For his expences, they are thought to be as great now as ever, by reaſon of the ſeveral retinues of <hi>Himſelf,</hi> his <hi>Mother,</hi> his <hi>Queen,</hi> and the <hi>Monſieur.</hi> Neither are his gifts leſſened. The late warrs which he mannaged againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> coſt him dear, he being fain to bind unto him moſt of his <hi>Princes</hi> by money and Penſions. As the expences of the <hi>King</hi> are brought unto this Court to be examined, ſo are
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54835:113"/>
alſo the gifts and penſions by him granted to be ratified. The titulary power given to this <hi>Chamber,</hi> is to cut off all thoſe of the <hi>Kings</hi> grants which have no good ground and foundation; the Officers being ſolemnly, at the leaſt formally, ſworn, not to ſuffer any thing to paſs them to the detriment of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> whatſoever Letters of Command they have to the contrary: But with this Oath they do oftentimes diſpenſe. To this <hi>Court</hi> alſo belongeth the Enfranchiſement or <hi>Naturalization</hi> of <hi>Aliens.</hi> Anciently certain <hi>Lords, Officers</hi> of the Crown, and of the <hi>Privie Council,</hi> were appointed to look into the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts: now it is made an ordinary and ſoveraign Court, conſiſting of two <hi>Preſidents,</hi> and divers <hi>Auditors,</hi> and after, under Officers. The Chamber wherein it is kept is called, <hi>La Chambre des Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> it is the beautifulleſt piece of the whole Palace, the great Chamber it ſelf not being worthy to be named in the ſame day with it. It was built by <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1485. afterwards adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and beautified by <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, whoſe <hi>Statua</hi> is there ſtanding in his Royal Robes, and the <hi>Scepter</hi> in his hand; he is accompanied by the four <hi>Cardinal-Virtues,</hi> expreſſed by way of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglychick,</hi> very properly and cunning: each of them have in them its particular <hi>Motto</hi> to declare its being. The <hi>Kings</hi> Portraicture alſo as if he were the fifth Virtue, had its word under-written, and contained in a couple of verſes, which (let all that love the <hi>Muſes</hi> skip them in the reading) are theſe:

                     <l>Quatuor has comites fowro, caeleſtia dona</l>

               <p>From the <hi>King</hi> deſcend we to the Subjects, <hi>ab equis, quod aiunt, ad aſinos</hi>; and the phraſe is not much improper; the French Commonalty being called the <hi>Kings Aſſes.</hi> Theſe are divided into three ranks or Claſſes; the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the <hi>Nobleſs,</hi> the <hi>Paiſants,</hi> out of which certain <hi>Delegates</hi> or <hi>Committees,</hi> choſen upon an occaſion, and ſent to the <hi>King,</hi> did anciently concurre to the making of the ſupreme Court for juſtice in <hi>France,</hi> it was called the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of the three <hi>Eſtates,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus Ordinum,</hi> and was juſt like the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> but theſe meetings are now forgotten or out of uſe, neither indeed, as this time goeth, can they any way advantage the <hi>State.</hi> For whereas there are three principal if not ſole cauſes of theſe Conventions, which are, the diſpoſing of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency during the non-age or ſickneſs of a <hi>King</hi>; the granting aids or ſubſidies, and the redreſſing of grievances, there is now another courſe taken in them. The Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which ſpeaketh as it is prompted by power and greatneſs, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the <hi>Regent</hi>: the <hi>Kings</hi> themſelves with their Officers determine of the taxes, and as concerning their grievances, the <hi>Kings</hi> ear is open to private Petitions. Thus is that title of a Common-wealth, which went to the making up of this Monarchy, eſcheated or rather devoured by the <hi>King:</hi> that name alone containing in it both <hi>Clergy, Princes</hi> and <hi>People</hi>; ſo that ſome of the <hi>French Counſellors</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:54835:114"/>
may ſay with <hi>Tully</hi> in his Oration for <hi>Marcellus</hi> unto <hi>Caeſar, Doleoque cum Reſpublica immortalis eſſe debeat, eam unius mortalis anima conſiſtere:</hi> yet I cannot but withal affirm, that the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> of <hi>France</hi> do, for as much as concerneth themſelves, upon all advantages fly off from the <hi>Kings</hi> obedience; but all this while the poor <hi>Paiſant</hi> is ruined. Let the poor Tennant ſtarve, or eat the bread of carefulneſs, it matters not, ſo they may have their pleaſure, and be accompted firm Zealots of the Common liberty, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is the iſſue of it; the Farmer liveth the life of a ſlave to maintain his <hi>Lord</hi> in pride and lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the <hi>Lord</hi> leadeth the life of a <hi>King</hi> to oppreſs his Tennant by fines and exactions. An equality little anſwerable to the old platforms of <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. Ariſtotle, genius ille naturae,</hi> as a learned man calleth him, in his fourth book of <hi>Politicks</hi> hath an excellent diſcourſe concerning this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion. In that chapter his project is to have a correſpondency ſo far between Subjects under the <hi>King,</hi> or people of the ſame City, that neither the one might be over rich, nor the other too mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably poor. They, ſaith he, which are too happy, ſtrong, or rich, or greatly favoured, and the like, cannot nor will not obey, with which evil they are infected from their infancy. The other, through want of theſe things, are too abjectly minded and baſe, for that the one cannot but command, and the other but ſerve, and this he calleth, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a City inhabited onely by ſlaves and tyrants. That queſtionleſs is the moſt perfect and compleat form of Government: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi veneratur
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54835:114"/>
potentem humilis, non timet, antecedit, non contemnit humiliorem potens,</hi> as <hi>Velleius.</hi> But this is an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs whereof <hi>France</hi> is not capable, their <hi>Lords</hi> being <hi>Kings,</hi> and their <hi>Commons Villains.</hi> And to ſay no leſs of them than in truth they are, the <hi>Princes</hi> of this Country are little inferior in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Royalty</hi> to any <hi>King</hi> abroad, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence little reſpective in matter of obedience to their own <hi>King</hi> at home. Upon the leaſt diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they will draw themſelves from the Court, or put themſelves into Arms; and of all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are ever ſure of this, that they ſhall never want partizans, neither do they uſe to ſtand off from him fearfully and at diſtance, but juſtifie their revolt by publike declaration, and think the <hi>King</hi> much indebted to them, if upon fair terms, and an honourable reconcilement, they will pleaſe to put themſelves again into his obedience. <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth was a Prince of as undanted and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable a ſpirit, as ever any of his Predeceſſors, and one that loved to be obeyed, yet was he alſo very frequently baffled by theſe <hi>Roytelets,</hi> and at the laſt died in an affront.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> perceiving the <hi>Kings</hi> affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his new <hi>Lady,</hi> began to grow jealous of him, for which reaſon he retired unto <hi>Bruxels.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> offended at this retreat ſent after him, and commanded him home: The <hi>Prince</hi> returned anſwer, that he was the <hi>Kings</hi> moſt humble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Servant, but into <hi>France</hi> he would not come, unleſs he might have a Town for his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, withal he protected in publike writing a <hi>Nullity</hi> of any thing that ſhould be done to his
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54835:115"/>
prejudice in his abſence. A ſtomackful reſolution, and ſomewhat misbecoming a Subject: yet in this oppoſition he perſiſted, his humour of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence out-living the <hi>King</hi> whom he had thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted. But theſe tricks are ordinary here, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a man might have conſtrued this action by the term of rebellion. The chief meanes whereby theſe <hi>Princes</hi> become ſo head-ſtrong, is an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity given them by their <hi>Kings,</hi> and a liberty which they have taken to themſelves: By their <hi>Kings</hi> they have been abſolutely exempted from all tributes, tolles, taxes, cuſtoms, impoſitions and ſubſidies; by them they have been alwayes eſtated in whole entire Provinces, with a power of <hi>Hante and many juſtice</hi> (as the <hi>Lawyers</hi> term it) paſſed over unto them: the <hi>Kings</hi> having ſcarce an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or acknowledgement of them. To this they have added much to their ſtrength and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the inſconcing and fortifying their houſes, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> both often moveth &amp; afterwards enableth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to contemn his Majeſty. An example we have of this in the Caſtle of <hi>Rochforte,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Tremoville,</hi> which in the long <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> endured a ſhelf of five thouſand ſhot and yet was not taken. A very impolitick courſe (in my conceit) in the French, to beſtow honours and immunities upon thoſe, <hi>Qui</hi> (as the Hiſtorian ſaith) <hi>ea ſuo arbitrio aut repoſcituri, aut retentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem videantur, quique modum habent in ſua volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate:</hi> For upon a knowledge of this ſtrength in themſelves, the <hi>Princes</hi> have been alwayes prone to civil Warrs, as having ſufficient means for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and reſiſtance. On this ground all they write
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54835:115"/>
the <hi>Kings</hi> authority, and diſobey his juſtice. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the greateſt ſort of <hi>Nobles</hi> in this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> can ſeldom be arraigned or executed in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and therefore the Laws condemn them in their images, and hang them in their pictures. A pretty device to work juſtice. If by chance or ſome handſome ſleight any of them be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they are put under a ſure guard, and not doomed to death without great fear of tumult and unquietneſs. Neither is it <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nus &amp; alter,</hi> onely ſome two or three that thus ſtand upon their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the <hi>King,</hi> but even all the <hi>Nobility</hi> of the Realm- A rout ſo diſordered, unconfined and numberleſs, that even <hi>Fabius</hi> himſelf would be out of breath in making the reckoning. I ſpeak not here of thoſe that are ſtiled <hi>La Nobleſſe,</hi> but of <hi>Titulados,</hi> men onely of titular <hi>Nobility,</hi> of the degree of <hi>Baron</hi> and above: of theſe there is in this Country a number almoſt innumerable, <hi>quot Coelum ſtellas,</hi> take quantity for quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and I dare be of the opinion, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath not more Stars than <hi>France Nobles</hi>; you ſhall meet with them ſo thick in the <hi>Kings</hi> Court eſpecially, that you would think it almoſt impoſſible the Country ſhould bear any other fruit. This I think I may ſafely affirm and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> that they have there as many <hi>Princes</hi> as we in <hi>England</hi> have <hi>Dukes,</hi> as many <hi>Dukes</hi> as we <hi>Earls,</hi> as many <hi>Earls</hi> as we <hi>Barons,</hi> as many <hi>Barons</hi> as we <hi>Knights.</hi> A jolly company, and ſuch as know their own ſtrength too. I cannot but as much marvel, that thoſe <hi>Kings</hi> ſhould be ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal in conferring honours, conſidering this, that

every <hi>Nobleman</hi> he createth is ſo great a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to his power. On the other ſide, I cannot but as much wonder at ſome of our <hi>Nation,</hi> who have murmured againſt our late Soveraign, and accuſed him of an unpardonable unthriftineſs, in beſtowing the dignities of his Realm with ſo full and liberal an hand. Certainly could there any danger have riſen by it unto the State, I could have been as impatient of it as another. But with us titles and ennobling in this kind, are onely either the <hi>Kings</hi> favour, or the parties merit, &amp; maketh, whomſoever he be that receiveth them, rather reverenced than powerful. <hi>Raro eorum honoribus invidetur quorum vis non timetur,</hi> was a good A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſm in the dayes of <hi>Paterculus,</hi> and may, for ought I know, be as good ſtill: Why ſhould I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy any man that honour, which taketh not from my ſafety, or repine at my Soveraign for raiſing any of his Servants into an higher degree of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, when that favour cannot make them exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant. Beſides it concerneth the improvement of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> at the occaſions of Subſidies: and the glory of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> when the <hi>Prince</hi> is not attended by men meerly of the <hi>Vulgar.</hi> Add to this the few <hi>Noble men</hi> of any title, which he found at his happy coming in amongſt us, and the additions of power which his coming brought unto us, and we ſhall find it proportionable, that he ſhould enlarge our <hi>Nobility</hi> with our Country. Neither yet have we indeed a number to be talked of, comparing us with our neighbour <hi>Nations.</hi> We may ſee all of the three firſt rank in the books of <hi>Miles, Brook,</hi> and <hi>Vincent,</hi> and we are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

alſo a Catalogue of the creations and ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all our <hi>Barons</hi>; then we ſhould ſee that as yet we have not ſurfeited. Were this care taken by the <hi>Heralds</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> perhaps the <hi>Nobility</hi> there would not ſeem ſo numberleſs, ſure I am, not ſo confuſed: but this is the main vice of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: of ſix <hi>Heralds</hi> which they have amongſt them, <hi>Viz Mountjoy, Normandy, Guyenns, Valoys, Britain,</hi> and <hi>Burgoyne,</hi> not one of them is reported to be a <hi>Genealogiſt</hi>: Neither were their <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> better affected to this ſtudy. <hi>Peradine</hi> the onely man that ever was amongſt them, hath drawn down the <hi>Genealogies</hi> of twenty four of the cheif Families, all eminent and of the bloud; in which he hath excellently well diſcharged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: but what a ſmall pittance is that, compared to the preſent multitude.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nobles</hi> being ſo populous, it cannot be but the <hi>Nobleſs</hi> (as they call them) that is, the <hi>Gentry,</hi> muſt needs be thick ſet, and onely not innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Of theſe <hi>Nobleſs</hi> there be ſome that hold their eſtates immediately of the <hi>Crown,</hi> and they have the like immunity with the <hi>Princes.</hi> Some hold their <hi>feifes</hi> (or <hi>ſeuda</hi>) of ſome other of the <hi>Lords,</hi> and he hath onely <hi>Baſſe juſtice</hi> permitted to him, as to mulct and amerce his Tennants, to impriſon them, or to give them any other correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under death. All of them have power to raiſe and enhaunce up their rents, to tax his Subjects on occaſion, and to prohibite them ſuch pleaſures, as they think fit to be reſerved for themſelves. In <hi>Grettanl</hi> in <hi>Picardie</hi> I ſaw a poſt faſtened in the ground, like a race-poſt with us, and thereon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54835:117"/>
I made preſently to it, as hoping to have heard news of ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e memorable battel there fought, but when I came at it, I found it to be nothing but a declaration of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Condes</hi> pleaſure, that no man ſhould hunt in thoſe quarters. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I obſerved them to be very frequent. But not to wander through all particulars, I will in ſome few of them onely give inſtance of their power here.</p>
               <p>The firſt is <hi>Droict de Balliage,</hi> power to keep <hi>Aſſizes,</hi> or to have under them a <hi>Baillie,</hi> and an <hi>Imperial</hi> ſeat of juſtice, for the definition of ſuch cauſes as fall under the compaſs of ordinary juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. In this Court there is notice taken of treaſon, robberies, murthers, protections, pardons, fairs, markets, and other matters of priviledge.</p>
               <p>Next they have a Court of ordinary juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therein a <hi>Judge</hi> whom they call <hi>Le Guarde de Juſtice,</hi> for the deciſion of ſmaller buſineſs, as debts, treſpaſs, breach of the <hi>Kings</hi> peace, and the like. In this the purſe is onely emptied; the other extendeth to the taking away of the life; for which every one that hath <hi>Hante Juſtice</hi> annexed to his <hi>feife,</hi> hath alſo his particular Gibbet. Nay, which is wonderful methodical, by the <hi>Criticiſme</hi> of the <hi>Gibbet</hi> you may judge at the quality of him that owneth it, for the <hi>Gibbet</hi> of one of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſe</hi> hath but two pillars, that of the <hi>Chaſtellan</hi> three, the <hi>Barons</hi> four, the <hi>Earls</hi> ſix, the <hi>Dukes</hi> eight, and yet this difference is rather preciſe than general.</p>
               <p>The laſt of their <hi>jura Regalia,</hi> which I will here ſpeak of, is the Command they have upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54835:117"/>
to follow them unto the warrs, a Command not ſo advantagious to the <hi>Lord,</hi> as dangerous to the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus live the <hi>French Princes,</hi> thus the <hi>Nobleſſe,</hi> thus thoſe Sheep which <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> hath brought under them, they do not ſhear, but fleece them, and (which is worſe than this) having themſelves taken away the wooll, they give up the naked carcaſs to the <hi>King. Tonderi oves meas vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, non deglubi</hi>; was accounted one of the golden ſayings of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> but it is not currant here in <hi>France</hi>: Here the <hi>Lord</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> though otherwiſe at odds amongſt themſelves, be ſure to agree in this, the undoing and oppreſſing of the <hi>Paiſant. Ephraim</hi> againſt <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but both againſt <hi>Juda,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Scripture.</hi> The reaſon why they thus deſire the poverty of the Commons, is, as they pretend, the ſafety of the <hi>State,</hi> and their own particulars. Were the people once warmed with the feeling of eaſe, and their own riches, they would be preſently hearkening after the Warrs. And if no employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were offered abroad, they would make ſome at home. Hiſtories and experience hath taught us enough of this humour in this kind: it being impoſſible for this hot-headed and hare-brain'd people not to be doing. <hi>Si extraneus deeſt domi hoſtem quaerunt</hi>: as <hi>Juſtin</hi> hath obſerved of the ancient <hi>Spaniards.</hi> A pretty quality, and for which they have often ſmarted.</p>

                  <p>The baſe and low eſtate of the French Paiſant. The miſery of them under their Lords. The bed of <hi>Procruſtes.</hi> The ſuppreſsing of the Subject prejudicial to a State.

               </argument>
               <p>BY that which hath been ſpoken already of the <hi>Nobleſs,</hi> we may partly gueſs at the low eſtate of the <hi>Paiſant</hi> or Country man: of whom we will not now ſpeak, as Subjects to their <hi>Lords,</hi> and how
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54835:118"/>
farre they are under their commandment, but how miſerable and wretched they are in their apparel and their houſes: For their apparel, it is well if they can allow themſelves Canvas, or an outſide of that nature: As for Cloath, it is above their purſe, equally, and their ambition: if they can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire unto Fuſtian, they are as happy as their wiſhes: and he that is ſo arrayed, will not ſpare to aim at the beſt place in the Pariſh, even unto that of Church-Warden: When they go to Plow or to the Church they have ſhooes and ſtockings; at other times they make bold with Nature and wear their skins. Hats they will not want though their bellies pinch for it: and that you may be ſure they have them, they will alwayes keep them on their heads. The moſt impudent cuſtom of a beggarly fortune that ever I met with, and which already hath had my bleſſing. As for the Women, they know in what degree Nature hath created them, and therefore dare not be ſo fine as their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands: ſome of them never had above one pair of ſtockings in all their lives, which they wear every day, for indeed they are very durable: the goodneſs of their faces tels us that they have no need of a band, therefore they uſe none. And as concerning petticoats, ſo it is, that all have ſuch a garment, but moſt of them ſo ſhort, that you would imagine them to be cut off at the placket: When the parents have ſufficiently worn theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and that commonly is till the rottenneſs of them will ſave the labour of undreſſing; they are a new cut out and fittted to the Children. Search into their houſes, and you ſhall find them very
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54835:119"/>
wretched, and deſtitute, as well of furniture as proviſion. No butter ſalted up againſt Winter, no poudering tub, no pullein in the rick barten, no fleſh in the pot, or at the ſpit, and which is worſe, no money to buy them. The deſcription of the poor aged couple, <hi>Philemon</hi> and <hi>Baucis,</hi> in the eigth book of the <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> is a perfect cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>French Paiſant</hi> in his houſe-keeping, though I cannot affirm, that if <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> did come amongſt them, they ſhould have ſo hearty an entertainment; for thus <hi>Ovid</hi> marſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the diſhes.</p>

patilla,</hi> the beſt proviſion they can ſhew you, is a piece of <hi>Bacon</hi> where with to fatten their pottage, and now and then the inwards of Beaſts killed for the Gentleman. But of their miſeries, this me thinketh is the greateſt, that ſowing ſo many acres of excellent Wheat in a year, and gathering in ſuch a plentiful vintage as they do, they ſhould not yet be ſo fortunate as to eat white bread, or drink Wine: for ſuch infinite rents do they pay to their <hi>Lords,</hi> and ſuch innumerable taxes to the <hi>King,</hi> that the profits ariſing out of theſe commodities are onely ſufficient to pay their duties, and keep them from the extremities of cold and famine. The bread which they eat is of the courſeſt flower, and ſo black that it cannot admit the name of brown, and as for their drink, they have recourſe unto the next fountain: A people of any the moſt infortunate, not permitted to enjoy the fruit of their labours: and ſuch as above all others are ſubject to that <hi>Sarcaſme</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel, This man planted a Vineyard, and doth not drink of the fruit thereof.</hi>

               <p>Yet were their caſes not altogether ſo deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if there were but hopes left to them of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if they could but compaſs this certainty, that a painful drudging and thrifty ſaving would one day bring them out of this hell of bondage. In this queſtionleſs they are entirely miſerable; in that they are ſenſible of their preſent fortunes, and dare not labour nor expect an alteration.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54835:120"/>
If induſtry and a ſparing hand hath raiſed any of theſe afflicted people ſo high, that he is but four or five ſhillings richer than his neighbour, his <hi>Lord</hi> immediately enhanceth his rent, and enformeth the <hi>Kings</hi> task-maſters of his riches; by which meanes he is within two or three years brought into equal poverty with the reſt. A ſtrange courſe and much different from that of <hi>England</hi>; where the <hi>Gentry</hi> take a delight in having their Tennants thrive under them, and account it no crime in any that hold of them to be wealthy. On the other ſide, thoſe of <hi>France</hi> can abide no body to gain or grow rich upon their Farms, and therefore thus upon occaſions rack their poor Tennants. In which they are like the <hi>Tyrant Procruſtes,</hi> who laying hands upon all he met, caſt them upon his bed: if they were ſhorter than it, he racked their joynts till he had made them even to it; if they were longer, he cut as much of their bodies from them as did hang over; ſo keeping all that fell into his power in an equality of ſtature. I need not make further application of the ſtory but this, that the <hi>French Lords</hi> are like that <hi>Tyrant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How much this courſe doth depreſs the military power of the Kingdom, is apparent by the true principles of warr, and the examples of other Countries. For it hath been held the general opinion of the beſt judgements in matters of war, that the main buttreſs and pillar of an Army is the foot, or (as the <hi>Martialiſts</hi> term it) the infantry. Now to make a good infantry, it requireth that men be brought up not in a ſlaviſh or needy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of life, but in ſome free and liberal manner.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54835:120"/>
Therefore it is well obſerved by the <hi>Viſcount St. Albons</hi> in his hiſtory of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, that if a State run moſt to <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> and that the Husbandmen be but as their meer drudges, or elſe ſimple Cottagers, that that State may have a good <hi>Cavilleria,</hi> but never good ſtable bands of Foot: like to Coppines wood, in which, if you let them grow too thick in the ſtanderds, they will run to buſhes or briers, and have little clean under wood. Neither is it thus in <hi>Franne</hi> onely, but in <hi>Italy</hi> alſo, and ſome other parts abroad; inſomuch that they are enforced to employ mercenary Souldiers for their battalions of Foot; whereby it cometh to paſs in thoſe Countries, that they have much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple but few men.</p>
               <p>On this conſideration <hi>King Henry</hi> the ſeventh, one of the wiſeſt of our <hi>Princes,</hi> took a courſe ſo cunning and wholeſome for the encreaſe of the military power of this Realm, that though it be much leſs in territories, yet it ſhould have infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more Souldiers of its native forces than its neighbour Nations. For in the fourth year of his raign there paſſed an Act of Parliament preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively againſt the depopulation of Villages and decay of tillage, but purpoſely to make his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for the warrs. The Act was, that all houſes of Husbandry which had been uſed with twenty acres of ground and upwards ſhould be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and kept up ſo, together with a competent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Land to be uſed and occupied with them, &amp;c. By this meanes the houſes being kept up, did of neceſſity enfarce a dweller, and that dweller, becauſe of the proportion of Land, not to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54835:121"/>
be a beggar, but a man of ſome ſubſtance, able to keep hinds and ſervants, and to ſet the Plow go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. An Order which did wonderfully concern the might and manhood of the Kingdom, theſe Farmers being ſufficient to maintain an able body out of penury, and by conſequence to prepare them for ſervice, and encourage them to high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: for,
<q>
                     <l>Haud facile emergunt, quorum virtutibus obſtat</l>
                     <l>Res anguſta domi —</l>
                     <l>As the <hi>Poet</hi> hath it.</l>
                  </q>
But this Ordinance is not thought of ſuch uſe in <hi>France</hi>; where all the hopes of their Armies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the Cavallery or the Horſe; which perhaps is the cauſe why our Anceſtors have won ſo many battels upon them: As for the <hi>French</hi> Foot, they are quite out of all reputation, and are accounted to be the baſeſt and unworthieſt company in the world.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſhould the <hi>French</hi> people be enfranchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed as it were from the tyranny of their <hi>Lords,</hi> and eſtated in free hold, and other tenures after the manner of <hi>England,</hi> it would much trouble the <hi>Councill</hi> of <hi>France</hi> to find out a new way of raiſing the <hi>Kings</hi> Revenues, which are now meerly ſucked out of the bloud and ſweat of the Subject. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had rich and plentiful demeaſnes, ſuch as was ſufficient to maintain their Majeſty and greatneſs, without being burdenſome unto the Country. Pride in matters of ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and the tedious Civil warrs which have
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54835:121"/>
laſted in this Country almoſt ever ſince the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, have been the occaſion, that moſt of the Crown Lands have been ſold and morgaged: inſomuch that the people are now become the <hi>Demain,</hi> and the Subject onely is the revenue of the Crown; by the ſweat of their brows is the Court fed and the Souldier paid, and by their labours are the <hi>Princes</hi> maintained in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. What impoſitions ſoever it pleaſeth the <hi>King</hi> to put upon them, it is almoſt a point of treaſon, not onely to deny, but to queſtion: <hi>Apud illos vere regnatur, nefaſque quantum regi liceat dubitare</hi>; as one of them: The <hi>Kings</hi> hand lieth hard upon them, and hath almoſt thruſt them into an Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an bondage: the poor <hi>Paiſant</hi> being conſtrained to make up daily his full tale of brick, and yet have no ſtraw allowed him. Upon the ſight of theſe miſeries and poverties of this people, Sir <hi>John Forteſcue Chancellor</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in his book intituled, <hi>De laudibus Regum Angliae,</hi> concludeth them to be unfit men for <hi>Jurers</hi> or <hi>Judges,</hi> ſhould the cuſtom of the Country admit of ſuch a trial: for having proved there unto the <hi>Prince</hi> (he was Son unto <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth) that the manner of trial, according to the Common Law, by twelve <hi>Jurats,</hi> was more commendable than the practiſe of the Civil or Imperial Laws, by the depoſition onely of two Witneſſes, or the forced confeſſion of the perſon arraigned: the <hi>Prince</hi> ſeemed to marvel, <hi>Cur ea lex Angliae quae tam frugi &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilis eſt, non ſit toti mundo communis</hi>: to this he maketh anſwer, by ſhewing the free condition of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, who alone are uſed at theſe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54835:122"/>
Inditements; men of a fair and large eſtate, ſuch as dwell nigh the place of the deed committed: men that are of ingenuous education, ſuch as ſcorn to be ſuborned or corrupted, and afraid of infamy. Then he ſheweth how in other places all things are contrary: the Husbandman an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute beggar, eaſie to be bribed by reaſon of his poverty: The Gentlemen living far aſunder, and ſo taking no notice of the fact. The <hi>Paiſant</hi> alſo neither fearing infamy nor loſs of goods if he be found faulty, becauſe he hath them not. In the end he concludeth thus: <hi>Nec mireris igitur prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps, ſi lex quae</hi> Anglia <hi>veritas inquiritur, ab ea non pervagetur in alias nationes: Ipſae namque, ut</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glia, <hi>nequeunt facere ſufficientes, conſimileſque jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</hi> The laſt part of the <hi>Latine</hi> ſavoureth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the <hi>Lawyer</hi>; the word <hi>Jurata</hi> being there put to ſignifie a <hi>Jury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To go over all thoſe impoſitions, which this miſerable people are afflicted withal, were almoſt as wretched as the payment of them. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeak onely of the principal: and here I meet in the firſt place with the <hi>gabel</hi> or impoſition on <hi>Salt.</hi> This <hi>gabelle de Sel,</hi> this Impoſt on Salt was firſt begun by <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Long,</hi> who took for it a <hi>Double,</hi> which is half a <hi>Sol,</hi> upon the pound. After whom <hi>Philip de Valoys, Anno</hi> 1328. doubled it. <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh raiſed it unto three <hi>Doubles,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh unto ſix; ſince that time it hath been altered from ſo much upon the pound to a certain rate on the Maid, which containeth ſome thirty buſhels <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the rates riſing and falling at the <hi>Kings</hi> pleaſure. This one Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54835:122"/>
were very advantagious to the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> were it all in the <hi>Kings</hi> hands; but at this time a great part of it is morgaged. It is thought to be worth unto the <hi>King</hi> three millions of Crowns yearly, that onely of <hi>Paris</hi> and the <hi>Provoſts</hi> ſeven Daughters being farmed at 1700000. Crowns the year. The late <hi>Kings</hi> ſince <hi>Anno</hi> 1581. being intangled in warrs, have been conſtrained to let it to others; inſomuch that about <hi>Anno</hi> 1599. the <hi>King</hi> loſt above 800000. Crowns yearly: and no longer then <hi>Anno</hi> 1621. the <hi>King</hi> taking up 600000. pounds of the <hi>Provoſt</hi> of the <hi>Merchants</hi> and the <hi>Eſchevins,</hi> gave unto them a Rent charge of 40000. pound yearly, to be iſſuing out of the cuſtoms of Salt till their money were repaid them. This <hi>gabel</hi> is indeed a <hi>Monopolie,</hi> and that one of the unjuſteſt and unmeaſurableſt in the world: for no man in the Kingdom (thoſe Countries hereafter mentioned excepted) can eat any Salt, but he muſt buy it of the <hi>King,</hi> and at his price, which is moſt unconſcionable; that being ſold at <hi>Paris</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where for five <hi>liures,</hi> which in the exempted pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is ſold for one. Therefore that the <hi>Kings</hi> profits might not be diminiſhed, there is diligent watch and ward, that no forrain Salt be brought into the Land, upon pain of forfeiture and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment. A ſearch that is made ſo ſtrictly, that we had much ado at <hi>Diepe</hi> to be pardoned the ſearching of our Trunks and Port-mantues; and that not but upon our ſolemn proteſtations, that we had none of that Commodity. This Salt is of a brown colour, being onely ſuch as we in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> call <hi>Bay Salt,</hi> &amp; is impoſed on the Subjects by
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54835:123"/>
the <hi>Kings</hi> Officers with great rigor. For though they have ſome of their laſt proviſion in the houſe, or perchance would be content (through pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) to eat their meat without it; yet will theſe cruel villains enforce them to take ſuch a quantity of them; howſoever they will have of them ſo much money. But this tyranny is not general; the <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>Picards</hi> enduring moſt of it, and the other <hi>Paiſants</hi> the reſt. Much like unto this was the licence which the <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> of old granted in matter of keeping <hi>Concubines</hi>: for when ſuch as had the charge of gathering the <hi>Popes</hi> rents happened upon a Prieſt which had no <hi>Concubine,</hi> and for that cauſe made denial of the tribute, the Collectors would return them this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that notwithſtanding this they ſhould pay down the money, becauſe they might have had the keeping of a Wench if they would.</p>
               <p>This <hi>gabel</hi> as it ſitteth hard upon ſome, ſo are there ſome alſo, who are never troubled with it: of this ſort are the <hi>Princes</hi> in the general releaſe, and many of the <hi>Nobleſs</hi> in particular: inſomuch that it was proved unto <hi>King Lewis, Anno</hi> 1614. that for every Gentleman which took of his Majeſties Salt, there were two thouſand of the Commons. There are alſo ſome entire Provinces which refuſe to eat of this Salt, as <hi>Britain, Gaſcoine, Poictou, Queren, Naintogne,</hi> and the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Boulonnois.</hi> Of theſe the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Boulonnois</hi> pretendeth a peculiar exemption, as belonging immediately to the patrimony of our <hi>Lady (Noſtre-Dame)</hi> of which we ſhall learn more when we are in <hi>Bovil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> The <hi>Britains</hi> came united to the Crown by a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54835:123"/>
fair marriage, and had ſtrength enough to make their own Capitulations, when they firſt entered into the <hi>French</hi> ſubjection; beſides, here are yet divers of the <hi>Ducal</hi> Family living in the Country, who would much trouble the quiet of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhould the people be oppreſſed with this bondage, and they take the protection of them. <hi>Poictou</hi> and <hi>Queren</hi> have compounded for it with the former <hi>Kings,</hi> and pay a certain rent yearly; which is called the <hi>Equivalent. Xaintogne</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of <hi>Rochell,</hi> of whom it receiveth ſufficient at a better rate. And as for the <hi>Gaſcoynes</hi> the <hi>King</hi> dareth not impoſe it upon them for fear of rebellion. They are a ſtubborn and churliſh people, very impatient of a rigorous yoak; and ſuch as inherit a full meaſure of the <hi>Beiſeains</hi> liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſpirit, from whom they are deſcended. <hi>Le Droit de fonage,</hi> the priviledge of levying of a certain peice of money upon every Chimney in an houſe that ſmoaked, was in times not long ſince one of the <hi>Jura Regalia</hi> of the <hi>French Lords,</hi> and the people paid it without grumbling: yet when <hi>Edward</hi> the black Prince returned from his unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> and for the paying of his Souldiers to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was indebted, laid this <hi>fonage</hi> upon the people, being then <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently revolted to the <hi>French,</hi> and brought great prejudice to our affairs in thoſe quarters.</p>
               <p>Next unto the <hi>Gabel</hi> of Salt we may place the <hi>Taille</hi> and the <hi>Taillon</hi>; which are much of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the <hi>Subſidies</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> being granted by the people, and the ſum of that certain ſhall pleaſe to impoſe them. Anciently the <hi>Tailles</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:54835:124"/>
were onely levied by way of extraordinary ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and that upon four occaſions, which were, the <hi>Knighting</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> Son, the <hi>Marriage</hi> of his <hi>Daughters,</hi> a <hi>Voyage</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> beyond Sea, and his <hi>Ranſome</hi> in caſe he were taken Priſoner. <hi>Les Tailles ne ſont point deves de devoyer ordicmer</hi> (ſaith <hi>Rayneau) ains ont eſte accorded, durant la neceſſite des Affaires Semblement.</hi> Afterward they were continually levied in times of warr, and at length <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt made them ordinary, neither is it extended equally, all of it would amount to a very fair revenue. For ſuppoſing this, that the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of <hi>France</hi> contained two hundred millions of acres (as it doth) and that from every one there were raiſed to the <hi>King</hi> two <hi>Sols</hi> yeerly; which is little in reſpect of the taxes impoſed on them; that income alone, beſides that which levied on goods perſonal, would amount to two millions of pounds in a year. But this payment alſo lyeth all on the <hi>Paiſant.</hi> The greater Towns, the Officers of the <hi>Kings Houſe,</hi> the Officers of Warrs, the <hi>Preſidents, Counſellors</hi> and Officers of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> the <hi>Nobility,</hi> the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and the <hi>Schollars</hi> of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> being freed from it. That which they call the <hi>Taillon,</hi> was intended for the eaſe of the Country, though now it prove one of the greateſt burdens unto it. In former times, the <hi>Kings</hi> Souldiers lay all upon the charge of the Villages, the poor people being fain to find them diet, lodging and all neceſſaries for themſelves, their horſes and their harlots, which they brought with them. If they were not well pleaſed with their entertainment, they uſed commonly to beat
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54835:124"/>
their Hoſt, abuſe his family, and rob him of that ſmall proviſion which he had laid up for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and all this <hi>Cum privilegio.</hi> Thus did they move from one Village to another, and at the laſt returned unto them from whence they came, <hi>Ita ut non ſit ibi villula una expers calamitatis iſtius, quae non ſemel aut bis in anno hac nefandâ preſſurâ depiletur,</hi> as Sir <hi>John F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To redreſs this miſcheif, <hi>King Henry</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Anno</hi> 1549. raiſed his Impoſition called the <hi>Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> iſſuing out of the lands and goods of the poor Country man; whereby he was at the firſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what eaſed: but now all is again out of order, the miſerable Paiſant being oppreſſed by the Souldier as much as ever, and yet he ſtill payeth both taxes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Taille</hi> and the <hi>Taillon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pancarte</hi> comprehendeth in it divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular impoſts, but eſpecially the <hi>Sol</hi> upon the <hi>Liure,</hi> that is, the twentieth penny of all things bought or ſold (corn, ſallets, and the like onely excepted.) Upon wine, beſides the <hi>Sol</hi> upon the <hi>Liure,</hi> he hath his ſeveral cuſtoms at the entrance of it into any of his Cities, paſſages by Land, Sea, or River. To theſe <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1561. added a tax of five <hi>Sols</hi> upon every <hi>Maid,</hi> which is the third part of a Tun, and yet when all this is done, the poor <hi>Vintner</hi> payeth unto the <hi>King</hi> the eighth penny he takes for that wine which he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Pancart</hi> is alſo contained the <hi>bant paſſage,</hi> which are the tols paid unto the <hi>King,</hi> for paſſage of men and cattel over his bridges and his City gates, as alſo for all ſuch Commodities which they
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:54835:125"/>
bring with them. A good and round ſum conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the largeneſs of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> the <hi>thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Lyons</hi> being farmed yearly of the <hi>King</hi> for 100000. Crowns. Hereunto belong alſo the <hi>Aides,</hi> which are a taxe alſo of the <hi>Sol</hi> on the <hi>Liure,</hi> upon all ſorts of fruits, proviſion, wares and Merchandize, granted firſt unto <hi>Charles Duke</hi> of <hi>Normandy,</hi> when <hi>John</hi> his <hi>Father</hi> was priſoner in <hi>England</hi>; and ſince made perpetual. For ſuch is the lamentable fate of that Country, that their kindneſſes are made duties; and thoſe moneys which they once grant out of love, are alwayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exacted of them, and paid out of neceſſity. The bedrolle of all theſe impoſitions and taxes is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Paneart,</hi> becauſe it was hanged up in a frame, like as the Officers Fees are in our <hi>Biſhops Dioceſan</hi> Courts; the word <hi>Pan</hi> ſignifying a frame or pane of wainſcot. Theſe impoſitions time and cuſtom hath now made tolerable, though at firſt day they ſeemed very burdenſome, and moved many Cities to murmuring, ſome to rebellion. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> proud of her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient liberties and immunities, refuſed to admit of it. This indignity ſo incenſed <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixth their <hi>King,</hi> then young and in hot bloud, that he ſeized into his hands all their priviledges, took from their <hi>Provoſt des Merchants</hi> and the <hi>Eſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins,</hi> as alſo the key of their gates, and the chains of their ſtreets, and making through the whole Town ſuch a face of mourning, that one might juſtly have ſaid:
<q>Haec facies <hi>Troiae</hi> cum caperetur erat.</q>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:54835:125"/>
This happened in the year 1383. and was for five years together continued; which time being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and other Cities warned by that example, the impoſition was eſtabliſhed, and the priviledges reſtored. For the better regulating of the profits ariſing from theſe impoſts, the <hi>French King</hi> erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Court, Le Cour des Aides.</hi> It conſiſted at the firſt of the general of the <hi>Aides,</hi> and of any four of the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Councel, whom they would call to their aſſiſtance. Afterwards <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1380. or thereabouts, ſettled it in <hi>Paris</hi> and cauſed it to be numbred as one of the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Courts, Lewis</hi> the eleventh diſſolved it, and committed the managing of his <hi>Aids</hi> to his Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſervants, as loath to have any publike Officers take notice how he fleeced his people, <hi>Anno</hi> 1464. it was reſtored again. And finally <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Anno</hi> 1551. added to it a ſecond Chamber, compoſed of two <hi>Preſidens</hi> and eight <hi>Counſellors.</hi> One of which <hi>Preſidents,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cavilayer,</hi> is ſaid to be the beſt moneyed man of all <hi>France.</hi> There are alſo others of theſe Courts in the Country: as one at <hi>Roven,</hi> one at <hi>Montferrant</hi> in <hi>Averyne,</hi> one at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and another at <hi>Montpellier</hi> eſtabliſhed by <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, <hi>Anno</hi> 1537. For the levying and gathering up of rheſe taxes, you muſt know, that the whole Country of <hi>France</hi> is divided into twenty three generalities and Counties as it were, and theſe again into divers <hi>Eſlections,</hi> which are much like unto our Hundreds. In every of the Generalities there are ten or twelve Treaſurers, nine Receivers for the Generality, and as many Controulers, beſides all under Officers, which are
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:54835:126"/>
thought to amount in all to thirty thouſand men. When the <hi>King</hi> levieth his taxes, he ſendeth his <hi>Letters Patents</hi> to the principal Officers of every Generality, whom they call <hi>Les genereaux des Aides,</hi> and they diſpatch their warrant to the <hi>Ezlenzor</hi> Commiſſioners. Theſe taxing every one of the Pariſhes and Villages within their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral diviſions at a certain rate, ſend their Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to collect it, who account for it to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulers, by them it aſcendeth <hi>Ezleie</hi>; from him to the Receiver general of that Generality, next to the Controuler, then to the Treaſurer, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the <hi>General des Aides</hi>; and ſo

pence) of a Crown: So that by reckoning five <hi>teſtons</hi> to a Crown or <hi>Eſcue,</hi> as it is but two pence over, theſe Officers muſt collect five times the money which they pay to the <hi>King</hi>; which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouteth to ſeventy five millions, and is not much ſhort of that proportion which before I ſpake of. The <hi>Kings</hi> revenues then, notwithſtanding this infinite oppreſſion of his people, amounteth to fifteen millions; ſome would have it eighteen, which is alſo a good improvement in reſpect of what they were in times afore. <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh as good a Husband of his Crown, as ever any was in <hi>France,</hi> gathering but one and an half onely, but as you count the <hi>flow,</hi> ſo alſo if you reckon the <hi>ebb</hi> of his treaſures, you will find much wanting of a full ſea in his Coffers, it being generally known, that the Fees of Officers, Penſions, Garriſons and the men of Arms draw from him yearly, no fewer than ſix of his fifteen millions. True it is, that his Treaſure hath many good helps by way of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat,</hi> and that moſt frequently when he cometh to take an account of his Treaſurers and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.

               <p>Theſe circumſtances thus laid together and conſidered, we may the clearer and the better ſee our own felicities, which to expreſe generally and in a word, is to ſay onely this, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is in no circumſtance a <hi>French-man</hi>: here have we our money made of the beſt and pureſt matal, that onely excepted which a charitable conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath coined into farthings: here have we our <hi>King</hi> royally, and to the envy of the world, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently provided for, without the ſweat and bloud of the people: no pillages nor impoſitions upon any private wares; no Gabels upon our Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities: <hi>Nullum in tam ingenti regno veſtigal: non in urbibus pontium vae diſcriminibus publicanorum ſtationes</hi>; as one truly hath obſerved of us. The moneys which the <hi>King</hi> wanteth to ſupply his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities are here freely given him, he doth not compel our bounties, but accept them. The Laws by which we are governed, we impart, are makers of: each Peaſant of the Countrey hath a free voice in the enacting of them, if not in his perſon, yet in his <hi>Proxie:</hi> we are not here ſubject to the luſts and tyranny of our <hi>Lords</hi>; and may therefore ſay

The Countrey, ſuch as that part of the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>France</hi> towards <hi>Normandy,</hi> onely that the Corne fields were larger and more even: On the left hand of us we had a ſide-glance of the <hi>Royall</hi> houſe of <hi>Boys,</hi> and <hi>Vincennes,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Bifectre,</hi> and about ſome two miles beyond them, we had a ſight alſo of a new houſe lately built by Mr. <hi>Sillerie Chancellor</hi> of the Kingdome, a pretty houſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be, having two baſe Courts on the hither ſide of it, and beyond it a Parke, an ornament, whereof many great manſions in <hi>France</hi> are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant.</p>

This notwithſtanding, the <hi>King</hi> eſteemed himſelfe the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> not that he overcame, but becauſe not vanquiſht.

but the habit of the <hi>Church</hi> which was <hi>mourning</hi> for ſuch is the faſhion of <hi>France,</hi> that when any of the <hi>Nobleſſe</hi> are buried, the Church which entombeth them is painted black within and without for the breadth of a yard, or thereabouts, and their coats of Armes drawn on it. To goe to the charges of hanging it round with cloath is not for their profits. Beſides, this countefeit ſorrow feareth thieves, &amp; dareth out-brave a tempeſt. He for whom the Church of <hi>Chaſtres</hi> was thus apparelled, had been <hi>Lord</hi> of the Towne, by name as I remember Mr. <hi>St. Bennoist,</hi> his Armes were argent, three Creſcents on a Mullet of the ſame, but whether this Mullet were part of the Coat, or a mark onely of difference I could not learn. Thelike Funerall chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches I ſaw alſo at <hi>Toſtes</hi> in <hi>Normandie,</hi> and in a Village of <hi>Picardie,</hi> whoſe name I minde not; <hi>nec operae pretium.</hi> And now we are paſſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>France,</hi> a poore River, which for the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſſe of it, you would think a ditch parting it from the Province of <hi>La Beauſſe.</hi>

Certaine it is that in this Tract they were ſeated, and in likelihood in this <hi>Province</hi>; the names an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and moderne being not much different in ſenſe, though in ſound. For the <hi>Franks</hi> called that which in <hi>Latine</hi> is <hi>pulcher</hi> or <hi>bellus,</hi> by the name of <hi>Bell</hi> in the Maſculine Gender; <hi>Beu</hi> the Pronoune it, and <hi>Beau</hi> as it were the Faeminine. At this time <hi>Beau</hi> is Maſculine, and <hi>Belle</hi> Faeminine: ſo that the name of <hi>Bellocaſsi</hi> is but varied into that of <hi>Beauſſe</hi>: Beſides that <hi>Province</hi> which the <hi>Roman</hi> writers ſtile <hi>Bellovaci,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> now call <hi>Beauvais,</hi> where <hi>Belle</hi> is alſo turned into <hi>Beau.</hi> Adde to this, that the <hi>Latine</hi> writers doe terme this contrey, <hi>Bello Beſſia,</hi> where the ancient <hi>Bello</hi> is ſtill preſerved; and my conjecture may be pardoned, if not approved. As for thoſe which have removed this people into <hi>Normandie,</hi> and found them in the city of <hi>Baieux,</hi> I appeale to any underſtanding man, whether their peremptory ſentence, or my ſubmiſſe opinion be the more allowable.</p>

All the difference in them lay in the morning, and amongſt the maid-ſervants, for there we were not troubled with ſuch an importunate begging, as in that other countrey.

A ſweeter and more generous kinde of craving, than the other of <hi>Normandie,</hi> and ſuch as may ſeem to imply in it ſome happy contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for what elſe is it, that a maid ſhould proffer
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54835:134"/>
her ſelf to be deflowred without prejudice to her modeſty, and raiſe to her future husband an honeſt ſtock by the uſury of a kindeneſſe. Refreſhed with theſe favours, we took our leave of <hi>Eſtampes</hi> and the dancing Miſcelanie, jogging on through many a beautifull field of corne, till we came unto <hi>Anger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> which is ſix leagues diſtant: a Town of which I could not obſerve or heare any thing memorable, but that it was taken by <hi>Montacute,</hi> Earle of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſbury,</hi> as hee went this way to the ſiege of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> and indeed the taking of it was no great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, the walls being ſo thin that an arrow could almoſt as ſoon make a breach in them as a canon. The ſame fortune befell alſo unto <hi>Toury,</hi> a place not much beyond it in ſtrength or bigneſſe, onely that it had more confidence (as <hi>Savage</hi> an <hi>Engliſh Gentleman</hi> once ſaid) in the walls of bones, which were within it, than in the walls of ſtones which were without it.</p>
               <p>This Town ſtandeth in the middle way betwixt <hi>Eſtampes</hi> and <hi>Orleans,</hi> and therefore a fit ſtage to act a dinner on, and to it we went: by that time we had cleared our ſelves of our pottage, there entred upon us three uncouth fellowes with hats on their heads, like cover'd diſhes; as ſoon as ever I ſaw them, I caſt one eye upon my cloak, and the other on my ſword, as not knowing what uſe I might have of my ſteele to maintain my <hi>cloath.</hi> There was great talk at that time of Mr. <hi>Sonbiſe</hi>'s being in armes, and I much feared that theſe might be ſome ſtraglers of his army; and this I ſuſpected by their countenances, which were very thieviſh and full of inſolence. But when I had made a ſurvey
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54835:134"/>
of their apparell, I quickly altered that opinion, and accounted them as the excrement of the next priſon, deceived alike in both my jealouſies, for theſe pretty parcels of mans fleſh were neither bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor worſe, but even arrant fidlers, and ſuch which in <hi>England</hi> we ſhould not hold worthy of the whipping poſt. Our leave not asked, and no reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence on their parts performed, they abuſed our eares with a harſh leſſon; and as if that had not been puniſhment enough unto us, they muſt needs adde unto it one of their ſongs; by that little <hi>French</hi> which I had gathered, and the ſimpering of a <hi>Fille de joy</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> who came along with us, I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it was bawdy, and to ſay truth, more than pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently could be endured by any but a <hi>French-man,</hi> but <hi>quid facerem,</hi> what ſhould I doe but endure the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, for I had not lagu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WE are now come into the countrey of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> which though within the limits of <hi>La Beauſſe,</hi> will yet be accounted an intire Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it ſelfe, it is a dainty and pleaſant Region, very even and large in the fields of it, inſomuch that we could not ſee a hill or ſwelling of the ground within <hi>eye-reach.</hi> It conſiſted of an indifferent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Corne,</hi> but moſt plentiful of <hi>Vines,</hi> and hath of all other Fruits a very liberall portion. Neither is it meanly beholding to the <hi>Loyre</hi> for the benefits is receiveth by that River, on which the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:54835:136"/>
City of <hi>Orleans</hi> it ſelfe is ſweetly ſeated. Of all places in <hi>England, Worceſter-ſhire</hi> in my opinion cometh moſt nigh it, as well in reſpect of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as the ſcituation of the Towne: for certainly that Countrey may be called the <hi>Epitome of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> as that of <hi>France.</hi> To the richeſt of the Corn-fields of <hi>Orleans</hi> we may compare the Vale of <hi>Eveſham.</hi> Neither will it yeild for choyce and variety of Fruits, the Vine onely excepted. The Hedges in that Countrey are prodigall and laviſh of thoſe trees, which would become the faireſt Orchards of the Weſt, and in a manner recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penceth the want of Wine by its plenty of <hi>Perry</hi> and <hi>Syder.</hi> In a word, what a good Writer hath ſaid of one, we may ſay of both, <hi>Coelum &amp; ſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Poſita eſt in loco modice acclivi, ad flumen, quod turrigero ponti conjungitur, &amp; muro ſatis firmo munita,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> of <hi>Worceſter. Orleans</hi> is ſeated on the like declivitie of an hill, hath its bridge well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Turrets, and its walls of an equall ability
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54835:137"/>
of reſiſtance; <hi>Sed decus eſt ab incolis qui ſunt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſi &amp; humani, ab aedificiorum nitore, à templorum numero &amp; maxime à Sede Epiſcopali,</hi> ſaith he of ours in genrall; we may ſee it fitly applied to this in each particular. The people of this town are not of the feweſt, no town in <hi>France</hi> (the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it conſidered) being more populous: for ſtanding in ſo delicate an Aire, and on ſo commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious a River, it inviteth the <hi>Gentry</hi> or <hi>Nobleſſe</hi> of the countrey about it to inhabite there, and they accept it. Concerning their behaviour and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, certainly they much exceed the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> I was about to ſay all the <hi>French-men,</hi> and indeed I not grudge them this <hi>Eulogie,</hi> which <hi>Caeſar</hi> giveth unto thoſe of <hi>Kent,</hi> and verifie that they are <hi>omnium incolarum longe humaniſsimi,</hi> my ſelfe here obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more courteſie and affability in one day, than I could meet withall in <hi>Paris,</hi> during all my abode there. The buildings of it are very ſuitable to themſelves, and the reſt of <hi>France</hi>; the ſtreets large and well kept, not yeilding the leaſt offence to the moſt curious noſtrill: <hi>Pariſh Churches</hi> it hath in it 26. of different and unequall beeing, as it uſeth to be in other places; beſides theſe, it containeth the <hi>Epiſcopall Church</hi> of S. <hi>Croix,</hi> and divers other houſes of religious perſons, amongſt which is St. <hi>Jacques</hi>; of both which I ſhall ſpeak in their due order. Thus much for the reſemblance of the Townes, the difference betwixt them is this, that <hi>Orleans</hi> is the bigger, and <hi>Worceſter</hi> the richer. <hi>Orleans</hi> conſiſteth much of the <hi>Nobleſſe,</hi> and of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journers; <hi>Worceſter</hi> of <hi>Citizens</hi> and Home-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; and for the manner of life in them, ſo it is
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54835:137"/>
that <hi>Worceſter</hi> hath the handſomer woman in it, <hi>Orleans</hi> the finer, and in my opinion the lovelieſt in all <hi>France. Worceſter</hi> thriveth the moſt on <hi>Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Orleans</hi> on their <hi>Vine-preſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And queſtionleſſe the Wine of <hi>Orleans</hi> is the greateſt riches, not of the Towne onely, but of the <hi>Countrey</hi> alſo about it. For this cauſe <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In them all civill cauſes not exceeding <hi>250 Liu'res</hi> in Money, or 10. <hi>Liu'res</hi> in Rents, are heard and determined ſoveraignly and without appeale. If the ſumme exceed thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions the appeale holdeth good, and ſhall be examined in that Court of Parliament, under whoſe juriſdiction it is. Their Court here conſiſteth of a <hi>Baille,</hi> whoſe name is Mr. <hi>Digion,</hi> of twelve <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,</hi> two <hi>Lieutenants,</hi> one <hi>civill,</hi> the other <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall,</hi> and a publique <hi>Notarie.</hi> When Mr. <hi>Le Compte de St. Paul,</hi> who is the Governour or Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Generall of the Province cometh into their Court, he giveth precedency to the <hi>Baille,</hi> in other places he receiveth it.

on both ſides: and a third which is indeed the principall, on the <hi>Eaſt-ſide</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> it is called the <hi>Palle Malle,</hi> of an exerciſe of that name much uſed in this Kingdome, a very Gentleman-like ſport, not over violent, and ſuch as affordeth good opportunity of diſcourſe, as they walk from one mark to the other. Into this walk, which is of a wonderful length and beauty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſhall have a clear evening empty all the towne, the aged people bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing legs to carry them, and the younger armes to guide them. If any young Dame or <hi>Monſieur</hi> walk thither ſingle, they will quickly finde ſome or other to link with them, though perhaps ſuch with whom they have no familiarity. Thus do they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and re-meaſure the length of the <hi>Palle Malle,</hi> not minding the ſhutting in of the day, till dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath taken away the ſenſe of bluſhing; at all houres of the night, be it warm and dry, you ſhall be ſure to finde them thus coupled; and if at the yeares end there be found more children in the towne than fathers, this walk and the night are ſhrewdly ſuſpected to be acceſſories; a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cnovenience in mine opinion, than an <hi>Engliſh Kiſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet a fourth walk in this towne, called <hi>L'estappe,</hi> a walk principally frequented by <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> who here meet to confer of their occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It lieth before the houſe of Mr. <hi>Le Comte de St. Paul,</hi> the Governour, and reacheth up to the <hi>Cloiſter</hi> of <hi>St. Croix:</hi> of the buildings of which <hi>Church</hi> I could never yet hear or read of any thing, but that which is meerly fabulous: for the <hi>Citizens</hi> report, that long ſince, time out of minde, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a <hi>Viſion</hi> to a <hi>holy Monk,</hi> which lived therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,

The Superſtition is apparent in the worſhipping of ſuch rotten ſticks, as they imagine to be the remnants of the <hi>Croſſe</hi>: their calling of it holy, and dedicating of this <hi>Church</hi> unto it.

               <p>As for that other imputation of being a <hi>Witch,</hi> ſaving the credit of thoſe that condemned her, and theirs alſo, who in their writings have ſo repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, I dare be of the contrary opinion, for dividing her actions into two parts, thoſe that precede her coming unto <hi>Orleans,</hi> and thoſe that followed it, I find much in it of valour, ſomewhat perhaps of cunning, but nothing that is diveliſh; her relieving of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and courage ſhewn at the battaile of <hi>Patay</hi> and <hi>Gargean,</hi> with the conducting of the King unto <hi>Rhemes,</hi> are no ſuch prodigies, that they need to be aſcribed unto <hi>Witchcraft</hi>: She was not the firſt woman whom the world knew famed in armes, there being no Nation almoſt of the Earth, who have not had a Champion of this ſexe to defend their liberties: to omit the whole Nation of the <hi>Amazon's,</hi> to the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the time of their afflictions, the <hi>Lord</hi> raiſed up a Salvation by meanes of two women, <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Judith:</hi> And <hi>God</hi> is not the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> onely, but alſo of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Amongſt the <hi>Sirvans, Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> Queen of <hi>Palmira</hi> is very famous: the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> (whom ſhe often foiled) never mentioning her without honour.

To come home unto our ſelves, the writers of the <hi>Romans</hi> mention the revolt of <hi>Britaines</hi> and the ſlaughter of 70000 Confederates to the <hi>Romans,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Vocudia</hi>: and ſhe in the beginning of her encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to the action telleth the people thus, <hi>Solitum quidem Britannis foeminarum ductu bellare.</hi> Of all theſe Heroicall <hi>Ladyes,</hi> I read no accuſation of witchcraft; innative courage, and a ſenſe of injury, being the armes they fought withall.

This therefore is invented, and ſo that which of all the reſt muſt prove her a ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe, will onely prove her an impoſtor. <hi>Gerrard ſeigneur de Haillan,</hi> one of the beſt writers of <hi>France</hi> is of opinion, that all that plot of her coming to the <hi>King,</hi> was contrived by three <hi>Lords</hi> of the Court to hearten the people, as if <hi>God</hi> now miraculouſly intended the reſtauration of the <hi>Kingdome.</hi> Add to this, that ſhe never commanded in any battaile, without the aſſiſtance of the beſt Captaines of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, and amongſt whom was the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who is thought to have put this device into her head. The Lord <hi>Bellay</hi> in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Art Military, proceedeth further, and maketh her a man, onely thus habited: <hi>Pour fair revenir le courage aux Francois,</hi> which had it been ſo, would have been diſcovered at the time of her burning.

It happened afterwards that <hi>Lotharius Saxo</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> who began his Raigne <hi>Anno</hi> 1126, being 560 yeares after the death of <hi>Justinian,</hi> having taken the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Melphy</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> found there an old Copy of the <hi>Pandects.</hi> This he gave to the <hi>Piſans</hi> his Confederates, as a moſt reverend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of Learning and Antiquity, whence it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Litera piſana.</hi> Moreover he founded the <hi>

Thus the learning of the <hi>Greeks</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lay forgotten, and loſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> for 700 yeares, even unto <hi>Emanuel Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolarus</hi> taught it at <hi>Venice,</hi> being driven out of his owne <hi>Countrey</hi> by the <hi>Turks.</hi> Thus the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of <hi>Aristotle</hi> lay hidden in the moath of duſt and <hi>Libraries; Et nominabatur potiùs quam legebatur,</hi> as <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> obſerveth in his notes.

                     <hi>Orleans</hi> not an Univerſity, till the coming of the Jeſuits. Their Colledge there, by whom built. The Jeſuits not Singers. Their laudable and exact Method of teaching. Their Policy in it. Received not without great difficulty into <hi>Paris.</hi> Their houſes in that Univerſity. Their ſtrictneſſe unto the Rules of their order. Much maliced by the other Prieſts and Friers. Why not ſent into <hi>England</hi> with the Queen. And of what order they were that came with her. Our returne to <hi>Paris.</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> and an <hi>Academy</hi> ſtanding thus; thoſe which lived in our Fathers dayes, could hardly have called <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi>: a <hi>Shoole</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> being the name moſt fit for it. At this time, ſince the coming of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that appellation may not misbecome it; they having brought with them thoſe parts of Learning, which before were wanting in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that hath not been of any long ſtanding, their <hi>Colledge</hi> being yet not fully finiſhed: By an <hi>Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> over the gate, it ſeemeth to be the work of Mr. <hi>Cagliery,</hi> one of the <hi>Advocates</hi> in the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> a man of large practiſe, and by the conſequence, of great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:54835:150"/>
ſaid to intend the faſtening of his eſtate upon it. In this houſe doe thoſe of this order apply themſevles to the ſtudy of good <hi>Letters</hi>; in the purſuit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as the reſt of this <hi>Fraternity</hi> are, they are good proficients, and much exceed all other ſorts of <hi>Friers,</hi> as having better teachers, and more leiſure to learn. That time which the other ſpend at their <hi>High Maſſes,</hi> and at their <hi>Canonicall houres,</hi> theſe men beſtow upon their books, they being exempted from thoſe duties by their order. Upon this ground they trouble not their heads with the <hi>Crotchets</hi> of <hi>Muſick,</hi> nor ſpend their mouthes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the chanting out of their Services: they have other matters to employ their braines upon, ſuch as are the ruine of <hi>Kingdoms</hi> &amp; deſolation of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.</hi> It was the ſaying of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to play a Leſſon on the <hi>Lute, That he could not fiddle, but he could tell how to make a little Town a great City.</hi> The like may we ſay of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> they are no great ſingers, but are well skilled in making little <hi>cities</hi> great, and great ones little: and certaine it is, that they are ſo farre from any ability or deſire this way, that upon any of their ſolemne Feſtivals, when their Statutes require <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> they are faine to hire the Singing men of the next <hi>Cathedrall,</hi> as here upon the feaſt of their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron</hi> St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> being the 22. of <hi>July;</hi> they were compelled to make uſe of the voyces of the church of S. <hi>Croix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this advantage of leiſure is added the exact method of their teaching, which is indeed ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelves in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſend their ſons to their <hi>Schooles,</hi> upon deſire to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54835:151"/>
have them prove exquiſite in thoſe arts they teach. To them reſort the Children of the rich as well as of the poor, and that in ſuch abundance, that whereſoever they ſettle; other houſes become in a manner deſolate, or frequented only by thoſe of the more heavy and phlegmatick conſtitutions. Into their Schooles when they have received them, they place them in that forme or <hi>Claſſe,</hi> into which they are beſt fitted to enter. Of theſe <hi>Claſſes</hi> the loweſt is for <hi>Grammar</hi>; the ſecond for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or making of <hi>Themes,</hi> as we call it; the third for <hi>Poetrie,</hi> the fourth for <hi>Oratory,</hi> the fifth for <hi>Greeke Grammar</hi> and Compoſitions; the ſixth for <hi>Poeſie</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick</hi> of that Language; the ſeventh for <hi>Logick</hi>; and the eighth and laſt for <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</hi> In each of theſe Schools there is a ſeverall Reader, or Inſtitutor, who onely intendeth that art, and the perfection of it, which for that yeare he teacheth. That yeare ended, he removeth both himſelfe and Schollars with him into the <hi>Claſſes</hi> or Schoole next beyond him, till he hath brought them through the whole ſtudy of humanity. In the laſt Forme, which is that of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> he continueth two yeares, which once expired, his Scholars are made perfect in the Univerſality of Learning, and themſelves are manumitted from their <hi>Tutors,</hi> and permitted their private Studies. Nor doe they onely teach their Scholars an exictneſſe in thoſe ſeverall parts of Learning which they handle: but they alſo endeavour to breed in them an obſtinacy of minde, and a ſturdy eagerneſſe of ſpirit, to make them thereby hot proſecutors of their own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and impatient of any contrary conſideration:
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:54835:151"/>
This it is which maketh all thoſe of their education to affect <hi>Victory</hi> in all their controverſies of Wit and Knowledge, with ſuch a violence, that even in their very <hi>Grammaticall disputations,</hi> you ſhall find little boyes maintain arguments with ſuch a fierce impatience, that you would think it above the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of years; and all this they perform freely, and for nothing: the poore Paiſants ſonne being by them equally inſtructed with that of the <hi>Nobleſſe.</hi> By this meanes they get into their Society great honour and great ſtrength: Honour in furniſhing their Schooles with ſo many perſons of excellent quality, or nobility, of whom afterwards they make their beſt advantages for their ſtrength alſo: As for thoſe of the poorer ſort, they have alſo their ends upon them; for by this free and liberall edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their <hi>children,</hi> the common people doe infinitely affect them; beſides that, out of that rank of their Scholars, they aſſume ſuch into their Fraternity, whom they finde to be of a rare wit, an excellent ſpirit, or any other way fitted for their profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Thus do they make their owne purpoſe out of all conditions, and refuſe no fiſh which either they can draw into their nets, or which will offer it ſelfe unto them. <hi>Si locuples quis eſt, avari ſunt; ſi pauper ambitioſi: quos non oriens non occidens ſatiaverit, ſoli omnium opes atque in piam opur affectu concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcunt. Galgacus</hi> a Britiſh Captaine ſpake it of the Souldiers of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> we may as juſtly verifie it of theſe Souldiers of the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> they being the men whom neither the <hi>Eaſt</hi> nor <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> can ſatisfie, and who with a like fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency

deſire the education of the needy and the wealthy. Moreover, by this method of teaching they do not onely ſtrengthen themſelves in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of men abroad, but alſo fortifie themſelves within their owne walls at home; for by this meanes there is not one of their ſociety who hath perfectly concocted in his head the whole <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> of knowledge, but hath gained unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the true art of ſpeaking, and readineſſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing what he knoweth, without the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur or heſitancie; the greateſt happineſſe of a <hi>Scholer.</hi> To conclude then, and ſay no more of them &amp; their abilities (for <hi>virtus &amp; in hoſte probatur</hi>) it is thought by men of wiſdome and judgement, that the planting of a <hi>Colledge of Jeſuits</hi> in any place, is the onely ſure way to re-eſtabliſh that Religion which they profeſſe, and in time to eat out the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>This notwithſtanding they were at the firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them rightly oppoſed, &amp; no where more v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the year 1554. at which time they firſt began to ſet foot in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Colledge</hi> of the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> made a long Decree againſt them: in the end whereof are theſe words, and they are worth the reading, <hi>Videtur haec ſocietas in negotio fidei periculoſa, pacis &amp; Eccleſiae pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bativa, Monaſticae religionis everſiva, &amp; magis ad deſtructionem quam ad aedificationem.</hi> A <hi>cenſure</hi> too

called out of their Schooles, to be of their order, and therein imitate them in the art of <hi>Jeſuitiſme,</hi> and their myſteries of iniquity. There they teach them not <hi>Grammaticall</hi> conſtruction, or compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but inſtruct them in the paths of Vertue, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and Obedience, according to ſuch examples as their <hi>Authors</hi> afford them.

In their <hi>College</hi> they have the ſame method of teaching, which the others of their company uſe in <hi>Orleans.</hi> A <hi>Colledge</hi> firſt given unto them by Mr. <hi>William Prat,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Clermont,</hi> whoſe Houſe it was, but much beautified by themſelves after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe; for with the money which he gave unto them by his Will, which amounteth (as it was thought) to 60000. Crowns; they added to it the <hi>Court</hi> called <hi>de Langres,</hi> in S. <hi>James</hi>'s ſtreet; <hi>An.</hi> 1582. Their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery,</hi> or houſe of prayer or <hi>profeſſion,</hi> is that unto which they retire themſelves, after they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their duties in the <hi>College,</hi> by reading and ſtudying publickly in their ſeverall <hi>Claſſes</hi>; when they are here, their ſtudy both for time and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is <hi>ad placitum,</hi> though generally their onely ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in it, is <hi>Policy,</hi> and the advancing of their cauſe. And indeed out of this <hi>Trojan Horſe</hi> it is that thoſe firebrands and incendiaries, are let out to diſturb, and ſet in combuſtion the affaires of <hi>Christendome.</hi> Out of this Forge come all thoſe Stratagems, and tricks of <hi>Machiavillianiſme</hi> which
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:54835:153"/>
tend to the ruine of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> &amp; the deſolation of their Countries. I ſpeak not this of their houſe of <hi>Profeſſion</hi> here in <hi>Paris,</hi> either onely or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally; whereſoever they ſettle, they have a Houſe of this nature, out of which they iſſue to overthrow the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Being once ſent by their ſuperiours, a neceſſity is laid upon them of obedience, be the imployment never ſo dangerous; and certainly this nation doth moſt ſtrictly obey the rules of their order of any whoſoever, not excepting the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins,</hi> nor the <hi>Carthuſians.</hi> This I am witneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that whereas the <hi>Divinity Lecture</hi> is to end at the tolling of a Bell, one of the Society in the <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Clermont,</hi> reading about the fall of the <hi>Angells,</hi> ended his Lecture with theſe words, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique in quibuſcunque</hi>; for then was the warning given, and he durſt not ſo farre treſpaſſe upon his rule, as to ſpeak out his ſentence.</p>
               <p>But it is not the fate of theſe <hi>Jeſuites</hi> to have great perſons onely, and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities</hi> to oppoſe their fortunes, they have alſo the moſt accompliſht malice, that either the <hi>Secular Prieſts,</hi> or their friends amongſt whom they live, can faſten upon them. Some envy them for the greatneſſe of their poſſeſſions, ſome becauſe of the excellency of their Learning; ſome hate them for their power; ſome for the ſhrewdneſſe of their braines; all together making good that ſaying of <hi>Paterculus,</hi> that <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eminentis fortunae comes eſt invidia.</hi> True in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is, that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have in a manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved all this clamor and ſtomack by their own inſolencies, for they have not onely drawne into their owne hands all the principall affaires of <hi>Court</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:54835:154"/>
and <hi>State,</hi> but upon occaſions caſt all the ſtorme and contempt they can, upon thoſe of the other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The <hi>Janizaries</hi> of the <hi>Turke</hi> never more neglectfully ſpeak of the <hi>Aſapi,</hi> than theſe doe of the reſt of the <hi>Clergie.</hi> A great crime in thoſe men who deſire to be accounted ſuch excellent Maſters of their owne affections. Neither is the affection borne to them abroad, greater then that at home; amongſt thoſe, I mean, of the oppoſite party, who being ſo often troubled and frumped by them, have little cauſe to afford them a liking, and much leſſe a welcome. Upon this reaſon they were not ſent into <hi>England</hi> with the <hi>Queen,</hi> although at the firſt they were deſtinate to that purpoſe. It was well known how odious that name was among us, and ſo little countenance the <hi>Court</hi> or Countrey would have afforded them. They therefore that had the governance of that buſineſſe, ſent hither in their places the <hi>Oratorians</hi> or <hi>Fratres Congregationis. Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torii</hi> were a race of men never as yet offenſive to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> further than the generall defence of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> cauſe, and ſo leſſe ſubject to envie and exception. They were firſt entituled by <hi>Philip Nerius,</hi> not long after the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and advanced and dignified by <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi> the fifth, principally for this end, that by their inceſſant Sermons to the People of the lives of <hi>Saints,</hi> and other <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall antiquitie,</hi> they might get a new repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and ſo divert a little the torrent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples affections from the <hi>Jeſuits. Baronius,</hi> that great and excellent <hi>Hiſtorian</hi>; and <hi>Bozius</hi> that deadly enemy to the ſoveraignty of <hi>Princes,</hi> were of the firſt foundation of this new order.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Picardy</hi> is divided into the higher, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the territories of <hi>Calais</hi> and <hi>Burlogne,</hi> with the Town of <hi>Monſtrevelle</hi> and the lower; wherein are the goodly <hi>Cities</hi> of <hi>Amiens, Abeville,</hi> and many other places of principal note. The higher, which is the leſſer, and more Northern part, is bounded <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh Ocean,</hi> and on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> with <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artoys.</hi> The later, which is the larger, the richer and the more Southern, hath on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> the little <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Veromandoys,</hi> on the <hi>Weſt Normandy,</hi> and on the <hi>South</hi> the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Campaigne.</hi> In length it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all the fifty one degree of <hi>Latitude,</hi> and three parts of the fiftieth, extending from <hi>Cales</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> to <hi>Clermont</hi> in the <hi>South.</hi> In breadth it is of a great inequality: For the higher <hi>Picardy</hi> is like <hi>Linea</hi> amongſt the <hi>Logicians,</hi> which they define to be <hi>Longitudo ſine Latitudine,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed nothing in a manner but a meer bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

               <p>Concerning the name of <hi>Picardy,</hi> it is a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty beyond my reading and my conjecture. All that I can do is, to overthrow the leſs probable opinions of other Writers; and make my ſelf ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſcoffe which <hi>Lactantius</hi> beſtoweth on <hi>Ariſtotle.

Others fetch it from the <hi>Picts</hi> of <hi>Brittanie,</hi> whom they would have to fly hither, after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiture of their <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> by the <hi>Scots.</hi> A tranſmigration of which all Hiſtories are ſilent: this being the verdict of the beſt <hi>Antiquary</hi> ever nurſed up in <hi>Brittain. Picti itaque praelio funeſtiſſimo debellati, aut penitus fuerunt extincti, aut paulatim in Scotorum nomen &amp; nationem conceſſerint.</hi> Laſtly, ſome others derive the name from <hi>Pigs,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyeth a <hi>Lance</hi> or <hi>Pike</hi>: the inventors of which warlike Weapon the fathers of this device would fain make them. In like manner ſome of <hi>Germany</hi>

By this Office, which is the principal of all <hi>France,</hi> he hath place and command before and over all the <hi>Peers</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of the bloud, and at the coronation of the French Kings miniſtreth the Oath. When the <hi>King</hi> entereth a City in ſtate, or upon the rendition of that, he goeth before with the Sword naked; and when the <hi>King</hi> ſitteth in an Aſſembly of the three <hi>Eſtates,</hi> he is placed at the <hi>Kings</hi> right hand: he hath command over all his Majeſties Forces, and he that killeth him is guilty of high treaſon: he ſitteth alſo as cheif Judge at the Table of <hi>Marble,</hi> upon all ſuits, actions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and complaints whatſoever concerning the warrs.</p>
               <p>This Table <hi>de Marble</hi> was wont to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the great Hall of the <hi>Palace</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi>; from whence at the burning of that Hall it was removed to the <hi>Louure.</hi> At this Table doth the <hi>Admiral</hi> of <hi>France</hi> hold his Seſſions, to judge of traffiick, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, Letters of Marts, piracies and buſineſs of the like nature.

in <hi>Eire</hi> all his Majeſties Forreſts and Waters. The actions there handled are thefts and abuſes committed in the <hi>Kings</hi> Forreſts, Rivers, Parks, Fiſh-ponds and the like.

And ſo I leave the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> to take a veiw of his <hi>Province</hi>: A man at this time beloved of neither parties; hated by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as an <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> and ſuſpected by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> not to be entire.</p>
               <p>To proceed: <hi>July</hi> the twenty eighth we came unto <hi>Clermont,</hi> the firſt Town of any note that we met with in <hi>Picardy.</hi> A pretty nea Town, and finely ſeated on the riſing of an hill: For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:54835:161"/>
of it, it hath on the upper ſide of it an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent large <hi>Caſtle,</hi> and ſuch as were the ſcituations of it, ſomewhat helped by the ſtrengths of Art, might be brought to good ſervice. Towards the Town it is of an eaſie acceſs, to the fieldward more difficult, as being built on the pendicular fall of a Rock. In the year 1615. it was made good by <hi>Mr. Haroncourt</hi> with the Regiment of eight Companies, who kept it in the name of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the reſt of that Confederacy; but it held not long: For at the <hi>Marſhal d' Ancres</hi> coming before it with his Army and artillery, it was preſently yeilded. This warr, which was the ſecond <hi>Civil warr</hi> that had happened in the reign of <hi>King Lewis,</hi> was undertaken by the <hi>Princes</hi> chiefly to thwart the deſignes of the <hi>Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and to cruſh the powerableneſs of her grand favourite the <hi>Marſhall.</hi> The pretence (as in ſuch caſes commonly is) was the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: the occaſion, the croſs <hi>Marriages</hi> then conſummated by the <hi>Marſhal</hi> between the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>: For by thoſe marriages they ſeemed to fear the augmentation of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> greatneſs; the alienation of the affections of their ancient Allies, and by conſequence the ruine of the <hi>French Empire.</hi> But it was not the fate of <hi>D' Ancre</hi> to periſh; two years more of Command and inſolencies his <hi>deſtinies</hi> allowed, and then he tumbled: This opportunity of his death ending the third <hi>Civil war,</hi> each of which his faulty great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had occaſioned.</p>
               <p>What the ambition of his deſigns did tend to, I dare not abſolutely determine, though like enough
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:54835:161"/>
it is, that they aimed further than at a private or perſonal potency: for having under the favour and countenance of the <hi>Queen Mother,</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of the <hi>Kings</hi> ear, and of his counſels, he made a ſhift to get into his own hands an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority almoſt as unlimitted, as that of the old <hi>Mayre</hi> of the <hi>Palace</hi>; for he had ſuppreſſed the liberty of the general Eſtates, and of the <hi>Soveraign Court,</hi> removed all the <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors</hi> of the laſt <hi>King</hi>: raviſhed one of the <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> of the great Chamber, by name <hi>Mr. Le Jay,</hi> out of the <hi>Parliament</hi> into the Priſon; and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Garriſons of his own in moſt of the good Towns of <hi>Normandy,</hi> of which <hi>Province</hi> he was Governour: Add to this, that he had cauſed the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> being acknowledged the firſt Prince of the bloud, to be impriſoned in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi>: and had ſearched into the continuance of the lives of the <hi>King</hi> and his Brother by the help of ſorcery and witchcraft: Beſides he was ſuſpected to have had ſecret intelligence with ſome forrain <hi>Princes,</hi> ill-willers to the State, and had diſgraced ſome, and neglected others of the <hi>Kings</hi> Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates: And certainly thoſe actions ſeem to import ſome project beyond a private and obedient great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; though I can hardly beleive, that he durſt be ambitious of the <hi>Crown</hi>; for being a fellow of a low birth, his heart could not but be too narrow for ſuch an hope, and having no party amongſt the Nobility, and being leſs gratious among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he was altogether deſtitute of means to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs it. I therefore am of opinion, that the <hi>Spaniſh gold</hi> had corrupted him to ſome project
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:54835:162"/>
concerning the enlargement of that <hi>Empire</hi> upon the <hi>French</hi> dominions, which the <hi>croſs Marriages</hi> (whereof he was the contriver) and which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo full of danger to all the beſt <hi>Patriots</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> may ſeem to demonſtrate. And again, at that time, when he had put the Realm into this third combuſtion, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> had an Army on foot againſt the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and another in the Countries of <hi>Cleive</hi> and <hi>Juliers</hi>; which had not the timely fall of this <hi>Monſieur,</hi> and the peace enſuing prevented it, might both perhaps have met together in the midſt of <hi>France:</hi> but this is onely conjectural.</p>

from <hi>Clermont</hi> ſix <hi>French</hi> Leagues, and from <hi>Paris</hi> twenty. Our entertainment there ſuch as in other places, as ſluttiſh and as inconvenient. The next day, being the twenty ninth, about ten of the clock we had a ſight of the goodly and fair <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Amiens.</hi> A <hi>City</hi> of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles circuit within the wals, which is all the greatneſs of it, for without the wals it hath houſes few or none. A <hi>City</hi> very capacious, and for that cauſe hath been many times honoured with the perſons and trains of many great <hi>Princes</hi>: Beſides that, once it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained almoſt a whole Army of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For <hi>King Lewis</hi> the eleventh having made an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious peace with our <hi>Edward,</hi> and perceiving how ingrateful it was amongſt the military men, he intended alſo to give them ſome manner of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: he ſent therefore unto them three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Carts laden with the beſt Wines, and ſeeing how acceptable a preſent that had proved, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended alſo to feaſt them in <hi>Amiens</hi>; within half a league of which their Camp was lodged. This entertainment laſted four dayes, each ſtreet having in it two long tables, and each table being furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with very plentiful proviſion Neither were they denied entrance into any of the Taverns or Victualling-houſes, or therein ſtinted either in meats or drinks, whatſoever was called for, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraied by <hi>King Lewis.</hi> An action wherein, if my opinion might carry it, there was little of the <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician</hi>; for there were permitted to enter into the Town ſo many of the <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> at once, that had they been but ſo minded, they might eaſily have made themſelves as well Maſters of the place, as of

               <p>The buildings of this Town are of divers mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, ſome built of ſtone, others of wood, and ſome again of both: the ſtreets very ſweet and clean, and the air not giving place to any for a lively pureneſs: Of their buildings the principal are their <hi>Churches,</hi> whereof there are twelve onely in number. Churches, I mean, parochial, beſides thoſe belonging unto <hi>Religious Houſes.</hi> Next unto them, the work of moſt eſpecial note, is a great large <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> in method and diſpoſing of the beds much like unto the <hi>Hoſtel Dieu</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> but in
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:54835:163"/>
number much inferior: <hi>Et me tamen capuerant</hi>: and yet the decency of them did much delight me. The ſweetneſs and neatneſs of the Town proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth partly (as I ſay) from the air, and partly from the conveniencie of the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Some,</hi> on which it is ſeated: for the River running in one entire bank at the further end of the Town, is there divided into ſix <hi>Channels,</hi> which almoſt at an equal diſtance run through the ſeveral parts of it. Theſe Channels thus divided receive into them all the ordure and filth wherewith the Town were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe likely to be peſtered, and affordeth the people a plentiful meaſure of water, wherewith to purge the lanes and by-corners of it, as often as them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth. But this is not all the benefit of theſe Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels; they beſtow upon the <hi>City</hi> matter alſo of commodity, which is the infinite number of <hi>Grieſt-Mils</hi> that are built upon them. At the other end of the Town the Channels are again united into one ſtream, both thoſe places, as well at the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the union, of the Channels being exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortified with chains and piles, and alſo with bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks and out-works.</p>
               <p>Neither is the Town well fortified and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened at thoſe paſſages onely in the upper parts of it, having enough of ſtrength to enable them to a long reſiſtance. The <hi>Ditch</hi> round about it, ſave where it meeteth with the <hi>Cittadel,</hi> is exceeding deep and ſteepy, the wals of a good height, broad and compoſed of earth and ſtone equally: the one making up the outſide of them, and the other the inſide.

The Garriſon conſiſteth of two hundred and fity men (five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in all they ſhould be) who are continually in pay to guard the Cittadel: their pay eight Sols daily. The Governour of them is the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Chawne,</hi> who is alſo the Lieutenant or <hi>Deputy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi> of the whole <hi>Province</hi> under the <hi>Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Their <hi>Captain Mr Le Noyr,</hi> ſaid to be a man of good experience, and worthy his place. This <hi>Cittadel</hi> was built by <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth as ſoon as he had recovered the Town from the <hi>Spaniards, Anno</hi> 1591. It is ſeated on the lower part of the <hi>City,</hi> though ſomewhat on the advantage of an hill; and ſeemeth in my opinion better ſcituate to command the Town, than to defend it, or rather to recover the Town, being taken, than to ſave it from taking. They who have ſeen it, and know the arts of Fortification, report it to be impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.

Nor am I able to contradict it: for beſides that it is a skill beyond my profeſſion, we were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to come within it, to take a ſurvey of it at a diſtance: As ſoon as we approached nigh unto it, one of the Garriſon offered us the musket, a

To inſtance in particulars, the partition between the <hi>Quire</hi> and the body is ſo overlaid with gold, that the acuteſt ſight could apprehend no other ſubſtance of it, and yet had the art of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſo fully expreſt its power on it; that the coſt was much inferiour to the workmanſhip; ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly was it adorned with excellent imagery, and what elſe the hand of man could faſhion into por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture.

uſe. The firſt of them is that of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> which was divided from the <hi>Weſt</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> by a ſphere made of wood, which reached unto the top of the partition. On the outſide, the Planets, Starrs and Conſtellations were moſt artificially ſet down in their proper Orbes, with the time of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving their ſeveral courſes: On the inſide thoſe places were filled up with a pack of verſes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of our <hi>Lady.</hi> The Alter there was for matter and making the moſt glorious that ever I yet looked upon: that on the other ſide in the <hi>Quire,</hi> and over which is the image of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> being more deſpicable than were fit for the credit of a Village. Over this <hi>Altar</hi> was the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Statua,</hi> all gift, and of a full and womanly proportion: two <hi>Angels</hi> of the ſame materials attending on her: Finally, this <hi>Chappel,</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the richneſs and glory of it, may be ſtiled the <hi>Epitome</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>: that attribute of <hi>immenſae opulentiae templum,</hi> being no more deſervedly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to <hi>Solomons Temple,</hi> which <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpake it, than to this.</p>
               <p>The ſecond of them ſtood, as I remember, at the further end of the <hi>Church</hi> behind the <hi>Quire,</hi> not directed, for ought I could perceive, to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Saint</hi>: yet not to be paſſed over without a due remembrance: It was ſeparated from the reſt of the <hi>Church</hi> by two ranks of braſs pillars, one rank above the other. The pillars are curiouſly caſt, and ſuch as would not ſhame rhe workman. In the <hi>maſſing Cloſſet</hi> over the <hi>Altar</hi> there was hanged a tablet, which by the many lines and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows drawn in it, ſeemed to repreſent ſome piece

of building. Moving my hand towards my eye, in the nature and kind of a perſpective-glaſs, I perceived to be the repreſentation of that <hi>Church</hi> wherein I ſtood to ſee it, and it was done with that cunning, that it would almoſt have perſwaded a man out of himſelf, and made him beleive, that he had been in the <hi>Church-yard</hi>; ſo perfectly did it ſhew the majeſty of the <hi>Front,</hi> the beauty of the <hi>Iles,</hi> the number of the <hi>pillars,</hi> and the glory of the <hi>Quire</hi>; a kind of work in my opinion of all others the moſt excellent, and ſuch as would infinitely delight an <hi>Optick</hi>: Had not ſuch peices been vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar to me, it had more affected me: But in the gallery of <hi>Mr. Crane</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> once belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that <hi>humerous Phyſitian Mr. Butler,</hi> and in that of <hi>Sir Noel Caron</hi> late <hi>Leiger</hi> for the <hi>States</hi> at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> I had ſeen divers of them, whereof ſome perfecter.</p>
               <p>The third of theſe <hi>Maſſing Cloſſets</hi> was that of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> not ſo gorgeous as the reſt unto the eyes of them that ſaw it, but more uſeful to the ſoules of thoſe who had a mind to take the benefit of it, for therein hung an <hi>Indulgence</hi> granted by <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the fifteenth unto that <hi>Church,</hi> dated the twenty ſeventh of <hi>July, Anno Dom.</hi> 1612. and of his <hi>Popedom</hi> the twentieth. The contents of it were, an abſolute exemption from the pains and place of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> to thoſe, who upon the Feaſt of <hi>All-Soules (Feſtum commemorationis Sanctorum</hi> the <hi>Breif</hi> calleth it) and the <hi>Octaves</hi> of it, would come to pay their devotions and moneys in that Temple.

               <p>The firſt thing which we met with obſervable, was the Town and <hi>Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Pignigni</hi>: The Town poor and beggerly; and ſo unlikely to have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Province,</hi> as <hi>Mercator</hi> would have it: beſides the diſproportion, and diſſimilitude of their names.

The truth of ſtory by which this Town is famous in the writers of both Nations, is an enterviewe there given between our <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and their <hi>Lewis</hi> the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, upon the concluding of their nine years truce; a circumſtance of no great moment in it ſelf, had not <hi>Phillip de Comminees</hi> made it ſuch by one of his own obſervations.

               <p>WE are now come to the <hi>Country</hi> of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonnois,</hi> which though a part of <hi>Picardy,</hi> diſdaineth yet to be ſo counted; but will be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned a <hi>County</hi> of it ſelf: It comprehendeth in it the Towns of <hi>Boulogne, Eſcapes</hi> and <hi>Neuſ-Chaſtel,</hi> beſide-divers Villages, and conſiſteth much of hils and valleys, much after the nature of <hi>England</hi>; the ſoyl being indifferent fruitful of corn, and yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more glaſs than any other part of <hi>France</hi> (which we ſaw) for the quantity.

Since that time the <hi>Boulonnois</hi> being the Tennants of our <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> have enjoyed a perpetual exemption from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe tributes and taxes under which the reſt of <hi>France</hi> are miſerably afflicted. Amongſt others they have been alwayes freed from the gabel of Salt, by reaſon whereof, and by the goodneſs of their paſtures, they have there the beſt Butter in all the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> I ſay, partly by reaſon of their Salt, becauſe having it at a low rate they do liberally ſeaſon all their Butter with it; whereas they which do buy their Salt at the <hi>Kings</hi> price cannot afford it any of that dear commodity: Upon this ground, it is the cuſtom of theſe of <hi>Boulonnois</hi> to ſend unto their Freinds of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> a barrel of Butter ſeaſoned according to their faſhion; a preſent no leſs ordinary and acceptable, than Turkeys, Capons, and the like are from our Country Gentlemen to thoſe of <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>As for the Town of <hi>Boulogne</hi> it is divided into two parts, <hi>la haute Ville,</hi> and <hi>la Baſs Ville,</hi> or the <hi>High Town,</hi> and the <hi>Low Town,</hi> diſtant one from the other about an hundred paces and upwards.

It was made a <hi>City</hi> in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Anno</hi> 1553. at which time the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Terorenne</hi> was totally ruined by the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop</hi> was removed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

At the <hi>Church</hi> they began it in prayer, and having viſited all the Town, they returned
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:54835:177"/>
again thither to end it with the ſame devotion. An action vety grave and ſolemn, and ſuch as I could very well allow of, were it not onely for one prayer, which is alwayes ſaid at the time of this performance, and addition of the Banners: The prayer is this; <hi>Exaudi nos Deus ſalutaris noſter, &amp; intercedente beatâ &amp; glorioſa Dei genetrice Mariâ ſemper Virgine, &amp; Sebaſtiano beato Martyre tuo</hi> (this <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> is their <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> or <hi>Tutelary Saint</hi> againſt the ſickneſs) <hi>&amp; omnibus Sanctis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum tuum ab iracundiae tuae terroribus libera, &amp; miſericordiae tuae fac largitate ſecurum.

               <p>Theſe <hi>Proceſſions</hi> were firſt inſtituted by <hi>Pope Stephanus</hi> the ſecond, who began his <hi>Popedom Anno</hi> 752. the intent of them is, as <hi>Platina</hi> reporteth, <hi>Ad placandam Dei iram.</hi> The firſt place that they ever went to in <hi>Proceſſion,</hi> was the <hi>Church</hi> of our <hi>Lady</hi> in the Shambles, or <hi>ad Sanctam Dei genitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem ad praeſepe,</hi> as the <hi>Hiſtoria</hi> calleth them. As for the <hi>Letany,</hi> which is a principal part of it, it was firſt compiled by <hi>Mamercus Biſhop of Vienna</hi> in <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine,</hi> in the time of <hi>Pope Leo</hi> the firſt, which was 308. years after the time of <hi>Stephanus.</hi> The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of it was the often danger to which <hi>France</hi> was ſubject by reaſon of the frequency of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes: Since thoſe beginnings, which were fair and commendable, the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> hath added much to them of magnificence, and ſomewhat of impiety and prophaneneſs. As for the Brethren <hi>de la Charite,</hi> I could not learn any thing of their
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:54835:178"/>
original, but much of their office: for they are bound to viſit all ſuch as are infected with the Plague, to miniſter unto them all things neceſſary, and if they die, to ſhrowd them and carry them to their graves. Theſe duties they perform very willingly, being poſſeſſed with this fancy, that they are priviledged from contagion by vertue of their Order; and to ſay the truth, they are moſt of them old, and ſo leſs ſubject to it; and indeed ſuch ſapleſs, thin, and unbodied fellows, that one would think almoſt no diſeaſe could catch them: yet hath their prerogative not alwayes held to them: Of thirty three of them in <hi>Callice</hi> three onely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving the diſeaſe about four years ſince: But were the danger to which themſelves are liable all the inconvenience of it, I ſhould not much diſallow it.

               <p>This Town of <hi>Boulogne</hi> and the <hi>Country</hi> about it was taken by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth of <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1545. himſelf being in perſon at the ſiege; a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry coſtly and chargeable victory. The whole liſt of his Forces did amount to 44000. foot, and 3000. horſe: Field Pieces he drew after him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a hundred, beſides thoſe of ſmaller making, and for the conveyance of their Ordinance, bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and other proviſion, there were tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Continent above 25000. Horſes. True it is that his deſignes had a further aim, had not <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> with whom he was to join, left the field, and made peace without him, So that judging onely by the ſucceſs of the expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we cannot but ſay that the winning of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonnois</hi> was a dear purchaſe; and indeed in this one particular <hi>Sr. Walter Raleigh</hi> in the preface to his moſt excellent Hiſtory ſaith not amiſs of him, namely, that in his vain and fruitleſs expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions abroad, he conſumed more treaſure, than all the reſt of our victorious Kings before him did in their ſeveral Conqueſts: The other part of his cenſure of that <hi>Prince,</hi> I know not well what to think of, as meerly compoſed of gall and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Onely I cannot but much marvail that a man of his wiſdom, being raiſed from almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by the <hi>Daughter,</hi> could be ſo ſeverely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective againſt the <hi>Father</hi>: certainly a moſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable judge cannot but condemn him of want of true affection and duty to his <hi>Queen</hi>: ſeeing that
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:54835:180"/>
it is (as his late Majeſty hath excellently noted in his ΒΑΣΙΛΙΚΟΝ ΔΩΡΟΝ) a thing mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous to ſee a man love the Child and hate the Parents: And therefore he may earneſtly enjoyn his Son <hi>Henry,</hi> to <hi>repreſs the inſolencie of ſuch as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence to tax a vice in the perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeek craftily to ſtain the Race.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Preſently after this taking <hi>Boulogne,</hi> the French again endeavoured the regaining of it, even during the life of the <hi>Conquerour</hi>; but he was ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to keep his gettings: After his death the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being engaged in a warr againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Kit</hi> having raiſed a rebellion in <hi>Norfolk</hi> they began again the reconqueſt of it, and that more violently than ever. Upon news of their prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, an <hi>Ambaſſage</hi> was diſpatched to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth to deſire ſuccours of him; and to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the infancy and ſeveral neceſſity of the young <hi>King,</hi> who was then about the age of ten years. This deſire when the <hi>Emperour</hi> had refuſed to hearken to, they beſought him, that he would at the leaſt be pleaſed to take into his hands and keeping the Town of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> and that for no longer time, than until <hi>King Edward</hi> could make an end of the troubles of his Subjects at home. An eaſie requeſt; yet did he not onely deny to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>King</hi> in this, except he would reſtore the <hi>Catholike Religion,</hi> but he alſo expreſly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that neither any of his men or munition ſhould go to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> An ingratitude for which I cannot find a fitting <hi>Epithite,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what faſt friends the <hi>Kings of England</hi> have alwayes been to the united <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Burgundy</hi>

and <hi>Auſtria</hi>; what moneys they have helped them with, and what ſundry warrs they have made for them, both in <hi>Belgium</hi> to maintain their authority, and in <hi>France</hi> to augment their potency: from the marriage of <hi>Maximilian</hi> of the Family of <hi>Auſtria</hi> with the <hi>Lady Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in they ear 1478. unto the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, which fell in the year 1548. are juſt ſeventy years, in which time onely it is thought by men of knowledge and experience, that it coſt the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> at the leaſt ſix millions of pounds in the meer quarrels and defence of the <hi>Princes</hi> of thoſe Houſes.

And ſo I take my leave of <hi>France,</hi> a <hi>Country</hi> which I know not whether it be more happy in it ſelf, or more unhappy in its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.
