            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Scurvy; for the adequate cause being put into action, the effect must necessarily follow. The fourth is, that the <hi>Pox</hi> is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, between a mangy <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Whore, that was troubled with the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy;

That it is a mixt Disease, is discovered by the mixt signes, symptoms, (or accidents) some <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ssuing from the scabby Itch, others from the Scurvy. First, I'le demonstrate the <hi>Pox</hi> to be a true Scurvy. 2ly. That it's also a perfect man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giness. 3ly. That it is neither a Scurvy nor manginess singly by themselves, but a Disease that is engendred or bred out of a Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and manginess, being compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and knit together. 4. That the Scurvy, whereof the <hi>Pox</hi> doth consist, is not such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Endemick</hi> Scurvy, as the Air doth breed here in <hi>England</hi>; but an <hi>Epidemick</hi> Scurvy, much
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55229:13"/>
differing from the other. As to the first, that the <hi>Pox</hi> is a true Scurvy, may rationally be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because the time and place of the rise, or beginning, growth, height, ending, signs, or symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, properties, causes, and cure of the Scurvy and <hi>Pox</hi> are the same, as will appear to you in every particular. The Pox it's agreed by most Authors had its birth at <hi>Naples,</hi> and so had the Scurvy; for before the year 1495. it was never heard of, nor mentioned by any, but is recorded by several to have received its birth and name at <hi>Naples</hi> in the Year aforesaid. It was then called <hi>Scorno-Bo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ca,</hi> or foul mouth, (from <hi>Scorno</hi> a foul or shameful thing, and <hi>bocca</hi> mouth,) and from thence the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther names <hi>Scorbutum</hi> and Sc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck were derived. The next
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55229:14"/>
year after, it was observed to be spread among the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>Flemmings,</hi> being transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thither by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that were sent from <hi>Naples</hi> to Garrison among them, who from the <hi>Italian</hi> named it <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck.</hi> The <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>x</hi> generally begins with a lassitude or soreness of ones Limbs, weakness of the Knees and Legs, with a small pain about the Shins, and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion about the middle, blossoms into Pinck-colour spots like flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Even so begins the Scurvy. The <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>x</hi> in its growth buds into red, yellow, or duskish pimples, especially about the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and appears with a great change of the complexion, and a deep melancholy, and so doth the Scurvy. Being arrived to its height, it's attended with foul Ulcers scattered over the Body,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55229:14"/>
and flying retching pains, rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body most in the night, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Exactly so doth the Scurvy appear in its height. At last the <hi>Pox</hi> ends into fistules, rottenness of the Bones, tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fixt pains, Dropsies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions, Fevers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Into which likewise the Scurvy makes its ending. In short, there is no sign, or symptom in the <hi>Pox,</hi> but it's observed to be in the Scurvy, so likewise there is scarce a sign in the Scurvy, but its discerned in the <hi>Pox,</hi> which is the reason why Physicians do daily mistake, in judging some to be troubled with the <hi>Pox,</hi> that are troubled with the Scurvy; and others to be diseased with the Scurvy, that are infected with the <hi>Pox.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it's a property of the <hi>Pox</hi> never to appear with the same signes in two Bodies, but in one
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55229:15"/>
Body is attended with such signs, in another quite different; which is also proper to the Scurvy. Lastly, the <hi>Pox</hi> is oft cured with Vegetables, that are of a biting stinging nature, and contain a great deal of mordicant volatil Salt, as <hi>Guaiacum, Soapwort, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sic<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ria,</hi> &amp;c. which are also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per remedies for the Scurvy. To the second, that it is a manginess, is evidently discovered by its itching, running scabs, and scurf, besides Pocky Ulcers are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally covered with mangy scabs. To the third, though the <hi>Pox</hi> and the Scurvy be so very like, it's visible enough, they be not the same, but differ in malignity or fierceness of symptomes; for though the <hi>Pox</hi> and Scurvy are both featured with pimples, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Ulces, yet those in the Scurvy are less painful, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55229:15"/>
less inflam'd, and better colour'd. 2. In infection, the <hi>Pox</hi> being far more infectious than the Scurvy. 3. In itching scabs, and crusty Ulcers, which are not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the Scurvy. So that you may plainly discern the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to be a kind of mild <hi>Pox,</hi> and wants nothing but malignity of symptoms, a stronger sting of infection and itching scabs and scurff; all which the before-mentioned manginess doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to it; and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of their union and coales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence the <hi>Pox</hi> must necessarily result. Furthermore, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giness is so neer a kin to the <hi>Pox,</hi> the cure doth plainly confirm <hi>Mercury</hi> being a known and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced remedy for them both, besides the Night pains and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty pustles and Ulcers, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend manginess, do fully demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate

of the whole Body. To the 4th Note, 1. There are two sorts of Scurvy, one <hi>Endemick</hi> that's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred by the Air, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the place where it reigns, as this here in <hi>Englan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This Scurvy is very common also here in <hi>England,</hi> and being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken for the other kind of Scurvy by our Hackney-Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, is the cause why many are left incurable.

into another, from a hot, to a cold Distemper, from an inflamation into an Ulcer, from an Ulcer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a carnosity, thence into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirpation or stoppage. 3.

I have made it appear to you already, that the Pox was not brought from the West-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies hither; neither was it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred out of Mans flesh, for the <hi>Cannibals,</hi> and others, that feed altogether upon Mans flesh, are seldom troubled with that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.

cause, or the first occasion of the Pox, it's time I should bend my discourse to a discovery of the inward cause, which by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of modern Physicians is concluded to be a hidden malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant cause, or certain malignant steems, that pass from one body into another, effecting such pocky accidents (or symptoms,) by hidden means.

                     </gap>, fa</hi>; and therefore shall proceed to give my Reader a plainer and more satisfactory resolve. I have already clearly proved to you, that the Pox had its first rise from a complication of a Scurvy, with a mangy Itch, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of both their causes; so that sh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wing the inward cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55229:24"/>
of a manginess and Scurvy, you may thence collect the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cause of the Pox. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cause of a Scurvy is thick dreggish blood, that begins to fret, and grows fiery salt and gnawing; the inward cause of manginess is a burnt red gall, or rather adust blood volatilized, which through its fieriness ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the blood fiery, salt, and itching. Now suppose a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> that is troubled with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme fiery itching manginess, by reason of the fieriness of his blood, and acting the part of a furious Goat, with a fretted <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Next, suppose these little pocky steemy bodies being drawn into the body, have a power of breeding and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying into other pocky little bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of their own kind, and so having filled the veins and arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with such pocky gnawing steems, they cause scurffy pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, gnawing pains and Ulcers all over the body.

or symptoms of a Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Pox. Before I proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will tell you the different opinions of Physicians upon a Running of the Reins.

This certainly is erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, for if those Prostats, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spermatick, should be Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer'd, and in part eaten away, they could never be heal'd up, and so consequently a man would be troubled with the running for ever. Others are of Opinion, the running proceeds from a weakness of the said spermatick, or seedy Vessels, and so are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred incapable of retaining the Seed. Here they suppose the matter, that drops out at the

But after all, it's certain, that the matter that drops out at the Yard, is neither Seed nor seedy; for Seed be it never so much alter'd, hot, yellow, or green, yet it will keep its clamminess, and be ropy, so that it may be drawn from one another between ones fingers; whereas that which gleets in the Running of the Reins, is not at all clammy or ropy, nor can it be drawn between the fingers, but falls all into small drops, and is perfect matter, such as is bred in Ulcers. Besides, should all that dropping in a pocky running be Seed, it would wast a Man to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; moreover, it's common
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55229:29"/>
for Men, that have a pocky run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon them, to beget such Children; which is a sign the Seed is free from infection for some time. Wherefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the pocky Running of the Reins to be an Ulcer of all the whole Yard, where the infection turns its clammy blood into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect matter (or <hi>Pus,</hi>) which gnaws its way out, through the <hi>Urethra,</hi> or passage of the Urin: that this is so, is evident. 1. In a <hi>Gonorrhee</hi> the Yard is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly swelled all over. 2. The Yard is hot, and full of pain all over, by reason of the gnawing pocky matter it contains within the pores of its spungy flesh. 3. That that virulent or pocky matter doth sweat through, or gnaw its way through into the <hi>Urethra,</hi> doth appear hence, that if one press the Yard close about the

For the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Blew Pill</hi>; the Crude Mercury must be exactly clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from all dust and mineral recrements, by running it
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55229:56"/>
through a Shammey leather two or three times; afterwards must be as oft washt in good Wine vinegar, to free it from those leaden particles, generally uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, as appears by the <hi>

                     </gap>aeses,</hi> when the Vinegar is separated by exhalation from the black. Thirdly, it must be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced twice through a Retort from <hi>Calx vive</hi>; which serves to amor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize those arsenical mixtures, all Crude Mercury doth so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exert its malignity through. After all these vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tormentations of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, your sight shall discover to you, that for purity, splendor, fluidity and renuity, it's the Mineral that may be reputed the <hi>materia</hi> of Gold and Silver, and in respect of security and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from danger, may as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently be offered to many bodies,

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55229:57"/>
is extinguisht by juyce of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and other Acids, is not void of corrosion. Take of Mercury thus refined and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortized one dram, Extract of Guaiac. two scruples, B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

blood out of the right arm. The third day present the Patient with a Dose of those Blew Pils, and half an hour after, cause him to drink a Dose of our Antive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Decoction, prescribed in the last Article; repeating the same decoction at four in the afternoon, and at eight. This I can assure you is the safest and the most effectual method of all negligent Cures, that have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been discovered, and now from a Charitable disposition is presented to you, to prevent those various disasters the daily practice of Chyrurgeons and Apothecaries do occasion.

resembling its mother Scurvy than Manginess, you may thence conclude; it emulates her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in sluggishness, obstinacy. and other malign qualities; For as the Scurvy is observed to move slow in its symptoms, which are not very fierce, but sufferable, though very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and of a most radicated fixation, so is a Scorbutick Pox. On the other hand a Mangy Pox appearing in Scabs, and crusty Ulcers, being more mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine, is a more ruggid guest, and a quick traveller, that gives smart spurs to its fiery nag, and therefore gallops post through the body, which consequently must soon jade the Patient.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55229:64"/>
extract from several of my Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Patients, and set down those prescriptions, which for your further satisfaction you may find on several Apothecaries files in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By a Scorbutick Pox, in a large acception, may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood a Scurvy, gotten by a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal infection, and of such I have treated more than a few; but strictly it's a Pox, whose chief <hi>symptom</hi> is a sort of fugitive flying pains, that sometimes cause a distension in the musculous parts of the arms, other times in the legs, breast, head, belly especially, &amp; sides. Hereof I have observed two degrees. The first is, small tinckling pains in the parts aforesaid, running some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the toes, and fingers ends. Those of the second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, are more evident, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55229:64"/>
offensive pains; they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisht from Venereal night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pains, by their appearance at all times of the day or night, but especially at the Patients awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from sleep; upon the least course of Physick they disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, but certainly return after a short intermission. Their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cause is a virulent wind, distending and corroding the membranes of the muscles. Touching their previous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote causes take these Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. First, those that are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a Scorbutick Pox are chiefly such, whose Parents were pockified, and but imperfectly cured at the time they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, so that here is an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary pocky disposition in all their parts, spermatick and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, whence receiving a new infection, immediatly penetrates
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55229:65"/>
into the substantials, and unites with their very principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where it lies so firmly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched, that the Art of man can scarce dislodge it. Some months since, a disastered Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient applied himself to me for cure, his symptoms were only fugitive, distending inordinate pains, flying promiscuously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all parts, and at all times: Upon inquiry made into the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of this ill adventure, I found he had contracted it by one single converse with an hired woman, with whom also seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his comrades had negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though but with small gains, it may be of a small Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhee or Shancker, both which he had escaped. A month af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was put in mind of his transgression by wild inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate pains, running through
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55229:65"/>
his body, as if spirits had bee<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hunting one another in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness. For the removing of this, he was put into a saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion twice, each flux lasting three Weeks; but these means proving ineffectual, he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised to essay the vertue of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifick course, which recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced his pains as little as the former. It was in the Winter when he desired my help, a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son not very propitious for so difficult a work, however I put him into a very strict Method, at the termination whereof, ho found himself free from all pains and symptoms. In this case it's not to be doubted but this was a Scorbutick Pox, occasioned by virulent steems soon passing the spermatick parts, and in a short time penetrating and lodging themselves in the most retired
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55229:66"/>
seats of his body, where they were readily admitted into a previous hereditary pocky di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition, whereas had there bin no such previous disposition, the foresaid virulent fumes would have been intercepted by the spermatick parts, where they would have occasioned a Gonorrhee, Shancker, or some other <hi>Liminary</hi> infection, as they did in his Comrades. A second Observation is, that a Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Pox is also engendred in those, who were s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orbutick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and had received their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from a Scorbutick hired woman. A third is, that most scorbutick Venereal Diseases are occasioned, when the infected steems are received into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, without engendring a <hi>Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Pox.</hi>

               <p>THE Prognostick of a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick Pox implies in the general, it's the most difficult of all other kinds of Pox. In particular, a Scorbutick heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Pox, is for the most part incurable, in some few it's pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liable, and in very few curable.</p>
               <p>A simple Scorbutick Pox doth not admit of an easie cure, but requires both skill and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity; and therefore is not to be attempted by every Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</p>

               </gap> lost, if I relate to you the several kinds and differences of Venere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al scabs and scurf.</p>
            <p>Venereal scabs take their rise from malignant deep inflamed pustules, that feel sore, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conceive a black or duskish speck on the head of 'em, which in a very short time is converted into a rough scab of the same extent the pustule was off, and peeling it off with your hand (for of it self it doth not easily come off) you shall find a sordid matter or puss, that hath corroded the flesh ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uneven, which in less than a night is dried up into another variegated scab.</p>

            <p>Venereal scurf is a plain broad scab, even with the skin, or sometimes deeper in the flesh, so as the skin appears higher than it, taking its original from a large extent of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of small eruptions like red gum, which communicating their venom, are converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a large scab of a very ill co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, without any elevation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55229:72"/>
the skin. This skurf i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on the head in thin limber scales, is called a Venereal dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drif, which is usually a fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a malignanter scurf, that is soon like to follow.</p>
            <p>Both Venereal scabs and scurf do most frequent the head, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, temples (especially scurf) face and neck, not long after they over-run the whole body, and particularly the back.</p>
            <p>The difference between sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple scabs, and those that are Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal is, that those latter never itch unless when they are almost cured, and then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to exercise the nails a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>What concerns the cause of a Mangy Pox, it's certain those scabs and scurfare occasioned by steems, that consist of a more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack, or an alcalized <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

and venenous principle; Which being also very volatile and alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, renders them apt to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse themselves to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying with them a part of the adust humours of the Vessels, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in other shapes of scabs, scurf, and dandrif.</p>
            <p>For the Prognostick of this sort of evil, you may confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assure the patient, it's easier cured than any other Pox, and therefore it's no wonder, the <hi>French</hi> Physicians have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of excelling others in the curing that distemper, since those Venereal diseases that reign in <hi>France,</hi> are generally Mangy, &amp; consequently yield to a facile cure; but if at any time they meet with an Hectick Pox, or a Scorbutick, or any other mi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A <hi>Mangy Pox</hi> doth not hide itself long, but appears within a few Moneths after the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and moves quick and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, insomuch that if it be not suddenly checkt, it shews it self in corroding and Phagedenick Ulcers, which contracting a glutinous sordid matter, are apt to corrupt a whole member in a short time.</p>
