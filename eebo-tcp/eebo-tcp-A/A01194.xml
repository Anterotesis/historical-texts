            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He deſired and happy marriage of that Illuſtrious Princeſſe, with that magnanimous and Heroical Prince, of ſo great blood (but of greater merits) hath bin generally celebrated among all the ſubiects with ſuch an vnaccuſtomed ioy, that ſome of them, being not able to containe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and yet deſirous to ſhew their deuoted affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, haue ſtrained their Muſe to ſing a ioyfull <hi>Hymen</hi> to their Highneſſes nuptiall rights: Among vvhich company, I being one of the number, although infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to them all in euery thing (my loue and affection onely excepted) commaunded my Muſe, though in a hard and vnpleaſing ſtile, yet as well as ſhee could to expreſſe my vowed ſeruice and obedience to their Highneſſes. At the firſt I intended to haue made onely a ſhort and ordinary <hi>Epithalamium;</hi> but afterwards hauing conſidered better of it, I found it much fitter to diuide it into three bookes. The firſt Booke I ſent to the right Reuerend Father the
<pb facs="tcp:2761:4"/>
Lord Arch-biſhop of Yorke, who preſented it vnto the King. By this meanes I did thinke that if my firſt booke might haue a charitable cenſure of the wiſe and learned ſort of men, I might then, with leſſe feare and with more ſpirit, preſume to preſent this my booke, with the other two, vnto their Highneſſes. Notwithſtanding, I had no ſuch good conceit, either of myſelfe, or of my labours, to thinke them all three worthy to be expoſed to the iudgement, and cenſure of all men: and yet to haue put forth the one part, without the other, would haue made my Poeme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, which had been a greater inconuenience. At length, ſome of my friends hauing receiued this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme printed it, being delighted with the noueltie of the matter, and deſirous to ſhew their affection and my congratulation to that happy marriage. At the firſt it grieued me a little, that my book, being not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfected, ſhould be printed: but at laſt hauing no deſire to haue it printed againe, after that the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities were ended, ſom of my friends began to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune me that I would impart my booke vnto them. I being eaſily ouercome with their vrging yeelded vnto their requeſts: This booke they haue now tranſlated into Engliſh, to the end that the Ladies may be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of this curious ſymetrie. This booke I offer vp vnto your Highneſſe of whom I haue heard many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable relations at the right reuerend father in God my lord Arch-biſhop of Yorkes houſe; and now I do partly know your Highnes to be of ſuch a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſition, that you will not refuſe the protection of the firſt fruits of a Scholler, but rather cheriſh and maintaine them; eſpecially ſuch a one that proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

himſelfe and his labours at your Highneſſe feet, humbly beſeeching your Highneſſe not to ſuruey the booke with a curious eye, but to accept of that good minde which offers it. Laſt of all, I doe wiſh ſuch a Spouſe, as is deſcribed in theſe Hymnes, to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with your Highneſſe; and I beſeech thee, O God, to adde ſo much time to my yeeres, that I may liue to ſee it; to the end, that I may write a nuptiall Hymen of your Highneſſe marriage, in a more iudicious and acurate ſtile.</p>
