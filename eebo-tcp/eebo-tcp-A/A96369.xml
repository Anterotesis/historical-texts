         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Where ſo many clear Wits and ſtrong

and her generall courſe, is univerſall
and practically indifferent to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
it ſeems, therefore, but juſt her

it ſelf is, every where, intelligible.
<pb facs="tcp:115975:3"/>
Upon this reſentment, the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> (whoſe <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion</hi>

therefore, 'twere to Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize,
why I would lend it my

ſuch as you ſee, I offer them,

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:115975:4"/>
The main fault ſeem'd to
me to lye at their doores, who
neither do themſelves nor can
endure others ſhould expect
any certainty from It. Of
theſe I have obſerv'd two ſorts:
Some there are that avouch
as much of <hi>Geometry</hi> it ſelf:
ſome, that attribute this, not
to the <hi>defect</hi> of Nature, but
to the <hi>difficulty</hi> of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the <hi>intricateneſſe</hi>
of Natures folds. And, I
was about to provide a pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatory
diſputation to the
former: when this Dilemma
<pb facs="tcp:115975:4"/>
came into my head, that, They
either admit the evidence of
a legitimate Syllogiſm, or not:
if they admit it, they cannot
conteſt againſt Geometry; if
they admit it not, I ſaw not
what farther evidence there
was in Nature able to force
them: They were, therefore,
deſertours of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
nor otherwiſe to be dealt
with, then as Mad-men.
Turning, then, to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſort, I ſaw ther's no ſo
ſmart proceeding as the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall
way; where, when
<pb facs="tcp:115975:5"/>
'tis ask'd whether a thing can
be demonſtrated? the Affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
producing a demonſtration,
preſently deſtroyes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme:
So, I thought, I was
to proceed by <hi>Inſtances,</hi> if I
meant to perſwade any thing.
Thence ſprung this <hi>grain of
Muſtard-ſeed;</hi> which, to
what growth it may hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
riſe, 'tis not yet evident.</p>
                  <p>Why I have ſtiled them
<hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> the ſhortneſſe
and conciſe connection of the
work ſufficiently diſcover. I
call them <hi>Peripateticall,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb facs="tcp:115975:5"/>
throughout they ſubſiſt
upon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Principles;
though the concluſions ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
diſſent. That I declare
them written <hi>in the way of
that eminent Perſon and
excellent Philoſopher Sir
Kenelm Digby;</hi> 'tis, becauſe,
ſince, in that ſo juſtly-to-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envy'd
Book, <hi>Of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the Soul,</hi> he
has diſſected the whole compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of Nature, from the
firſt Notion of <hi>Body,</hi> to the
very joynts and articles of an
inviſible ſpirituall <hi>Soul,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:115975:6"/>
laid it before the eyes of all;
any other way, then that He
had traced out, I neither
would nor could proceed.
Whatever, therefore, you meet
with, upon <hi>that Subject,</hi> is
borrow'd thence: but ſo, as
that I have transferr'd only
the naked Bones, ſcarce hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together by their ſinews;
wholly deſtitute of thoſe
Nerves and Colours with
which they are ſated there.
There look for Nature,
where you ſhall miſſe neither
Oratour nor Philoſopher:
<pb facs="tcp:115975:6"/>
we only act the part of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgers
or Summuliſts. The
<hi>other things</hi> which are treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through this whole work,
ly yet hid in His Cabinet, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the pains of greater
leiſure. If I have call'd this
<hi>the Theoricall part;</hi> I would
not, thence, have you expect
another <hi>Practicall</hi> one: for,
I meant only to declare, that
I touch't nothing upon the
<hi>Morall.</hi> In <hi>Logick</hi> you
have a little; yet, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
unleſſe I'm deceiv'd,
more then need: for, few Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb facs="tcp:115975:7"/>
are to be preſcrib'd for
<hi>Uſe,</hi> but a great deal of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.
Out of <hi>the reſt,</hi> if I have
cut off the intricate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
petty Queſtions; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
I have deſerved thanks.</p>
                  <p>Do you ask, What fruits I
expect? That you ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there is, in Nature and
in things beyond Nature, a

                     <p>1. <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ogick</hi> is the Art of Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
<hi>Diſcourſe</hi> is the <hi>Progreſſe</hi>
of the <hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi> out of
one thought or judgement
into another: but in a more ſpeciall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of the word, 'tis A Motion
whereby the Underſtanding, out of a fit
and orderly diſpoſure of ſome judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
already poſſeſſed by it, deduces and
leads it ſelf into the <hi>knowledge</hi> of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
it was ignorant of. And this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115975:14"/>
when 'tis cloſe and exactly perfect,
is, by a Greek term, called a <hi>Syllogiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. A <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> is compos'd of three
Propoſitions: A <hi>Propoſition</hi> is a ſpeech
whereby ſomething is affirmed or denied
concerning another: Whence, to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
three parts are neceſſary; That
<hi>which</hi> is affirm'd, That <hi>of which</hi> 'tis af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
and That which expreſſes the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
or the <hi>Term</hi> which connects them
together.</p>
                     <p>3. Theſe three are called <hi>Notions,</hi> or
apprehenſions, or things as they are in the
Underſtanding, that is, according to what
is common to them in themſelves and in
the Underſtanding: For, as the Statue of
<hi>Caeſar</hi> in ſomething agrees with, in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
differs from <hi>Caeſar;</hi> ſo the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
actually poſſeſſed of any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
has ſomething wherein it reſembles
and agrees with the Object, other things
wherein 'tis unlike and differs from it.</p>
                     <p>4. 'Tis already ſaid that Propoſitions
are, ſome <hi>Affirmative,</hi> ſome <hi>Negative.</hi> Now,
ſometimes it falls out, that an Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is applied to one thing alone; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to divers indifferently, as many
agree in ſome one and the ſame Notion:
This laſt is called an <hi>Vniverſall</hi> Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115975:14"/>
as when we ſay, <hi>Every man is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Creature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. When the affirmation is applied to
one thing alone, that is taken either <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately,</hi>
as <hi>Socrates, Bucephalus,</hi> &amp;c. and
then the propoſition is called <hi>Singular:</hi> or
elſe <hi>indeterminately,</hi> as when we ſay, <hi>ſome
Man, or Horſe,</hi> &amp;c. and then 'tis call'd a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
propoſition.</p>
                     <p>6. Again: ſince a propoſition is either
affirmative or negative; and the ſame
thing cannot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at once, both be &amp; not-be: if,
at any time, one propoſition affirms what
another denies, ſuch cannot be both true
together; and therefore they are called
<hi>Oppoſites</hi> or <hi>Incompoſsibles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. When the affirmation and negation
falls upon the ſame thing in all reſpects,
ſuch propoſitions are called <hi>Contradictories;</hi>
as, <hi>Socrates, here and now, runs; Socrates,
here and now, runs not:</hi> But when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
is univerſall on both ſides, they
are called <hi>Contraries;</hi> as, <hi>All men are wiſe,
None are wiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. Farther: as 'tis evident, the ſame
thing cannot both be and not-be, <hi>at once;</hi>
ſo 'tis as clear that every thing <hi>is, whilſt it is:</hi>
whence, if at any time a propoſition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
the ſame thing concerning the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115975:15"/>
ſame, 'tis called <hi>ſelf-evident;</hi> as when we
ſay, <hi>The whole is greater then a part of it ſelf,</hi>
for 'tis as much as to ſay, <hi>A part and more
is more then a part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. Wherefore, if it be once known,
that the ſame Notion is <hi>identify'd</hi> with two
others; it will preſently be evident, that
thoſe two are identify'd betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
for otherwiſe, that Notion which
is the ſame with them would not be the
ſame with it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>10. Two propoſitions, therefore, being
put, which diſcover the identification of
ſome one Notion with two others; a third
propoſition evidently emerges, whereby
the identification of thoſe two Notions
betwixt themſelves is declared: And <hi>theſe
three</hi> compoſe a <hi>Syllogiſm.</hi>

                     <head type="sub">Of a Syllogiſm and its Concluſion.</head>
                     <p>1. A Propoſition being a ſpeech which
pronounces one thing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and ſince, betwixt three,
there can be but three Variations, <hi>viz.</hi> that
one be pronounced of two, or two of one,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115975:15"/>
or one of another, and that again of the
third; there are onely three ſorts or <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi>
of Syllogiſms.</p>
                     <p>2. And, a Syllogiſm conſiſting of ſuch
ſpeeches as connect one Term to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
ſince, this third way, the <hi>Term</hi> which
joyns the reſt falls into the midſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, becoming under or <hi>Subject</hi> to
one, and above or <hi>Predicate</hi> to the other;
it truly and properly connects them:
whence, that <hi>Figure</hi> whoſe <hi>Terms</hi> are thus
order'd, is call'd the <hi>Firſt;</hi> and 'tis the
chief of all others, for all the Propoſitions
and their Terms or Notions have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and determinate place and order in
the Syllogiſm:</p>
                     <p>3. Whereas, in the other Figures it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
not whether of the two <hi>Antecedents</hi> be
preferr'd; and, in the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> either of
the Terms may, <hi>indifferently,</hi> be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
or Predicate, And, if we look more
narrowly into it, the other two Figures
will, indeed, appear but <hi>diſtorſions</hi> of the
firſt; whereby the Notion, which, really,
is the <hi>Middle</hi> one of the three, is made one
of the <hi>Extremes,</hi> becauſe all the three are
identify'd. The firſt Figure, therefore, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is according to Nature, and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115975:16"/>
4. And in this firſt, becauſe the middle
notion is once affirm'd or made the <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi>
and once the <hi>Subject,</hi> the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cannot be varied, except it be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Univerſality and Particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or Affirmation and Negation; whence
the Concluſion becomes either an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
or Particular Affirmative or Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
as uſes to be cyphred by theſe words,
<hi>Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio:</hi> in which
the <hi>Vowells</hi> ſhew the Nature of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
A ſtanding for an Univerſall Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,
E, an Univerſall Negative, I, a
Particular Affirmative, O, a Particular Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</p>
                     <p>5. And, becauſe theſe four <hi>Differences</hi>
contein all manner of Propoſitions, in
which Truth may be look'd for; there are
onely four <hi>Moods</hi> or forms of Syllogiſms
profitable, and they ſufficient to deduce
it: the reſt are all provided rather for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
and abundance then benefit.</p>
                     <p>6. There is another kind of Syllogiſm
which ſome call <hi>Expoſitory,</hi> conſiſting pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Singulars:</hi> And becauſe a ſingular
propoſition comprehends its Notion as
well as an univerſall, 'tis a perfect Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm,
though little uſed in Sciences, and
therefore little treated of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115975:16"/>
7. Again; ſince thoſe things which are
<hi>Circumſtantiall</hi> to any other thing either
belong to it, or not; and if they belong
to it, then either to it alone, or to many
other things as well as it: the propoſitions,
too, which are deduc'd out of theſe, muſt
be ſome Proper, ſome Common, ſome
wholly Accidentall and Unconcerning.</p>
                     <p>8. Amongſt which, ſince <hi>Proper</hi> ones
alwayes expreſſe ſomething which has the
Nature of a <hi>Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Effect,</hi> and an Effect
cannot exiſt without an actuall Cauſe, nor
an actuall Cauſe without an Effect; ſuch
propoſitions are fit to conclude upon any
Subject, about which we are making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
that It is, and cannot poſſibly but
be; to do which we call <hi>framing a Science,</hi>
and the Syllogiſm whereby we work thus,
a <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> and its Concluſion, <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi>
which, if we know <hi>why</hi> a thing is,
that is, if the Demonſtration be made
from the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> both the knowledge and
Demonſtration are call'd <hi>à Priori,</hi> or from
ſomething going before; if otherwiſe,
<hi>à Poſteriori,</hi> or from ſomething follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>9. <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Vnconcerning</hi> Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are both of this Nature, Not to be
applied to the Concluſion but by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:115975:17"/>
and <hi>Mediation</hi> of ſome other cloſer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
which yet, lying hid and being
undiſcernable, are onely capable of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
an <hi>apparent</hi> knowledge call'd <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. From which rule, ſuch propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are to be excepted which aſſume for
proof the <hi>knowledge</hi> of another perſon:
for, ſince Knowledge is adequate to the
Thing it ſelf; 'tis, as it were, a <hi>proper Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident:</hi>
and the knowledge of a thing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by theſe propoſitions is call'd <hi>Faith.</hi>
Which kind of knowledge may arrive to a
<hi>certainty,</hi> if the Authority aſſum'd be out
of all queſtion: yet it is not Science, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
not <hi>evident;</hi> ſince the thing appears
but in the knowledge of <hi>another,</hi> and is
undiſcernable in <hi>it ſelf,</hi> being it moves not
the Underſtanding by it ſelf and things
naturally connected with it.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Predicaments in Common,
and the three firſt in particular.</head>
                     <p>1. WE have ſaid that Propoſitions
are compos'd of Notions; and
that a Notion is the thing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115975:17"/>
to the <hi>being</hi> it has in the <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:</hi>
There are, therefore, ſo many
kinds of Notions as there are ſeverall <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
habitudes</hi> of any thing without or
within the Underſtanding, whereby it
may be referr'd to any other thing, that is,
Predicated of a Subject.</p>
                     <p>2. Now any thing may be conſidered
both according to what it has in it ſelf or
is in its own Nature, and according to
other things which, by conſideration, are
drawn in and applied to it. And, as to its
intrinſecalls, a thing is conſider'd either
<hi>abſolutely</hi> and in its very ſelf; and ſo 'tis
call'd a <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
of it a Subſtantiall Predicate:
Or, as 'tis <hi>compar'd</hi> to all other things,
in that reſpect wherein all things <hi>agree;</hi>
and thus we ask, <hi>how big</hi> a thing is? and
what we anſwer concerning it is call'd its
<hi>Quantity:</hi> Thirdly, 'tis compar'd to thoſe
things which are of the <hi>ſame kind</hi> with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or to its own particular nature; and ſo we
ask, <hi>what manner</hi> of thing is it, that is, how
perfect is it in its own nature? and what
we anſwer is call'd its <hi>Quality:</hi> Laſtly, 'tis
compar'd to other particular things; and
we ask, <hi>what 'tis in reſpect</hi> to another? and
the anſwer is call'd <hi>Related</hi> or <hi>Relation.</hi>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:115975:18"/>
'Tis plain that, under theſe four heads, are
comprehended all things conſiderable in
the Nature of any Subject, that is, which
are in it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>3. But, thoſe things, which are <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall</hi>
to another and may be referr'd to
it, are either apply'd with <hi>Motion</hi> or in
<hi>Reſt.</hi> If in Reſt, the Predicate is neither
conſtantly fixt to the Subject, nor the
Subject to the Predicate; and then we
ask, <hi>where</hi> a thing is? and the anſwer is
call'd it's <hi>Place:</hi> Or elſe the Subject is fixt
to the Predicate; as a Statue to its Baſis,
Liquour to a Veſſell, one that ſits to his
Chair, &amp;c. and, as before, we ask, <hi>where</hi> a
thing is? whereto the Predicate we anſwer
is call'd its <hi>Site</hi> or <hi>Situation:</hi> Or laſtly, the
Predicate is fixt to the Subject, and we
ask, <hi>what it has?</hi> to which that we anſwer
is call'd its <hi>Habit,</hi> as Garments, Arms, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.</p>
                     <p>4. In <hi>Motion,</hi> if the Subject be mov'd,
the <hi>Agent</hi> alwaies accompanies it; if it
move, the <hi>Patient:</hi> and, in both caſes,
<hi>Time</hi> or the <hi>Motion of the Heavens</hi> goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them, from which no Motion
can be exempt. Of this laſt, we ask, <hi>When</hi>
was the Motion? and what we anſwer is
call'd the <hi>Time</hi> of the Motion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:115975:18"/>
5. When the Subject is mov'd, we ask,
<hi>by what?</hi> and that we anſwer is ſaid to <hi>Act,</hi>
and the Subject to <hi>Suffer</hi> from it: when the
Subject moves, we ask, <hi>what</hi> it moves? and
that we anſwer is ſaid to <hi>Suffer,</hi> and it ſelf to
<hi>Act.</hi> Thus, the reaſon is evident, why there
are juſt <hi>ten Orders</hi> or <hi>Claſſes</hi> of Predicates,
or Notions, or Beings in the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
which are call'd Predicaments.</p>
                     <p>6. Subſtance is immediately diſtinguiſht
into <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Body.</hi> The differences of
Spirits are unknown. Bodies are either
<hi>Living,</hi> that is, moving themſelves, or <hi>Dead,</hi>
that is, not moving, but mov'd by others.
Living bodies are either <hi>Senſitive,</hi> or <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Senſes.</hi> Senſitive are either <hi>Intellectuall,</hi>
viz. Man, or <hi>Brutall,</hi> Beaſts. Man is either
<hi>Socrates,</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Xenophon,</hi> &amp;c. and
theſe are no farther diviſible; whence they
are call'd <hi>Individualls;</hi> the reſt <hi>Vniverſalls,</hi>
becauſe they are predicated univerſally of
all that are under them, that is, of every
one.</p>
                     <p>7. Quantity is either <hi>Diſcrete,</hi> as Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
or <hi>Continu'd:</hi> and this, either <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent,</hi>
or <hi>Succeſsive.</hi> Permanent is twofold;
<hi>Extenſive,</hi> whoſe perfection conſiſts in three
degrees including one another, Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
Latitude, Profundity; and <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:115975:19"/>
which is Weight. Succeſſive Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is contein'd in Action, Paſſion, Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and, generally, in Motion.</p>
                     <p>8. Concerning the proper nature of
Body, becauſe 'tis Finite, we ask, of what
<hi>Figure</hi> 'tis? becauſe 'tis Alterable by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
we ask, <hi>how 'tis,</hi> in reſpect to thoſe
<hi>Qualities</hi> according to which 'tis variable?
as Heat, cold, colour, ſavour, &amp;c. and this
either <hi>conſtantly</hi> or <hi>in Motion;</hi> and we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
accordingly, either by the <hi>Paſſible
Quality</hi> or by the <hi>Paſſion:</hi> as, in a Feaver
to be hot, or to bluſh for Baſhfulneſſe, is a
Paſſion; but to be of a hot complexion,
or ruddy countenance, is a Paſſible quality.
Again, becauſe a <hi>Body</hi> is ordered naturally
to Act and to Suffer, we ask, what it <hi>can</hi> or
<hi>cannot</hi> do? and that which is anſwer'd is
call'd its <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Impotency.</hi> Laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
every nature conſiſts in a kind of
<hi>Temperature,</hi> we ask, whether it be well or
ill in reſpect to <hi>that;</hi> that is, whether it
exactly or diſproportionately poſſeſſes
thoſe things which are requiſite to that;
and this, either conſtantly or for a time?
to which the anſwer is call'd, reſpectively,
a <hi>Habit</hi> or <hi>Diſpoſition.</hi>

                     <head type="sub">Of the reſt of the Predicaments.</head>
                     <p>1. THoſe things which <hi>relate</hi> or are
<hi>compar'd</hi> to another, are either
compar'd for having ſome
Notion <hi>common</hi> to both; or for their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting</hi>
or <hi>Suffering;</hi> or elſe, by a certain third
way, which participates of both theſe: as,
when a Picture is made like the Originall,
that neither acts upon the Picture, nor is
the Picture (being wholy of another kind)
really like it, yet in a manner, 'tis both:
and this reſpect is call'd <hi>of the thing meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Meaſure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. And, in this kind, there is one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>relation,</hi> and that on the ſide of the <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured:</hi>
For a Relation being the <hi>Order</hi> of
one thing to another, and ſince, between
two things, one may be ſo ordered to the
other, that the other may either have or
not have a <hi>coordination</hi> to it; it comes to
paſſe that thoſe things which are in the
ſame order (ſuch as are thoſe two firſt
kinds) have a relation on both ſides, but
thoſe that are of different orders, ſo that,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115975:20"/>
notwithſtanding, the one be ordered to
the other, have a relation but on one
ſide.</p>
                     <p>3. Beſides, it often happens that the
Underſtanding, through Cuſtome or an
imperfect way of knowing, expreſſes even
things that have no ordination, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
relative reſemblance; and then 'tis
a <hi>mentall relation</hi> (by ſchoolmen call'd <hi>de
dici)</hi> not a <hi>reall</hi> one: as alſo, when the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
has expreſs'd the nature of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing by a <hi>Negation,</hi> ſaying, a Man
does not ſee, or has no hair; and then
gives a <hi>poſitive being</hi> to this Notion, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a Man is blind or bald; according to
the naturall Aptitude or Ineptitude of
the Subject to the denyed Quality, 'tis
call'd a <hi>Mentall Negation</hi> or <hi>Privation,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively.</p>
                     <p>4. Wherefore, ſince, by theſe only
ways, the Underſtanding can ſo vary any
thing which it knowes, that a change may
remain on the <hi>Objects</hi> ſide, and enter into
the conſideration of it, as belonging to
the thing known; there can be three
only kinds of <hi>Mentall Beings:</hi> For, the
diſputes of the Moderns concerning ſuch
entities, are but gay Trifles, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of an erroneous definition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:115975:20"/>
5. There is a kind of Relations, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly,
call'd <hi>Intellectuall,</hi> which follows
a thing in the <hi>Vnderſtanding</hi> in vertue of
the reall quality of mere <hi>Vnderſtanding;</hi>
and theſe relations are of a <hi>Logicall</hi> Nature,
as thoſe Terms of Univerſall, Predicable,
Subject, Antecedent, Conſequent, &amp; the
like: And theſe Relations as much follow
out of things, in that reſpect, as they are in
the Underſtanding, as <hi>Likeneſse</hi> follow's a
thing in as much as 'tis <hi>white,</hi> or <hi>Equality</hi>
becauſe 'tis <hi>Quantitative:</hi> This, therefore,
is call'd Intellectuall, becauſe the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is call'd Intellect, and in no other
reſpect.</p>
                     <p>6. An Agent and a Patient clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
two cauſes: which, yet, the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
(diſtinguiſhing, &amp; finding parts
differently reſpecting the effect) <hi>Logically</hi>
and to ſerve its turn for <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
into four.</p>
                     <p>7. And finding, in the Agent, that it
<hi>can</hi> and that it <hi>does Act;</hi> the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
call's that whereby it does or can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> act
the <hi>Efficient cauſe,</hi> and that which moves or
makes it to act, the <hi>End:</hi> Likewiſe, in the
Patient, diſtinguiſhing <hi>what it is</hi> that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
and <hi>what</hi> it ſuffers; it call's <hi>that</hi> the
<hi>Form, this</hi> the <hi>Matter:</hi> ſatisfying, thus, theſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115975:21"/>
Interrogations, From what? Why? By
what or How? In what?</p>
                     <p>8. <hi>Plato</hi> adds an <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Exemplar:</hi> but,
'tis clear, that what wants an Exemplar
cannot work without it; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there is not yet an <hi>Efficient</hi> cauſe. The
<hi>ſpecies</hi> of theſe, and indeed of all the laſt

                     <head type="sub">Of the five Predicables, and the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of Words.</head>
                     <p>1. HEnce 'tis evident, there are
two kinds or differences of
Predications: For ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates
of the ſame line or Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>comprehend</hi> others, and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
of them as an Univerſall of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular:
But Predicates of diſtinct lines
are predicated of one another, as a thing
ſuperadded is predicated of that to which
'tis apply'd.</p>
                     <p>2. Predicates of the firſt kind are ſaid
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115975:21"/>
to be predicated <hi>in quid</hi> or as the <hi>what;</hi>
being ſuch as anſwer to the queſtion, <hi>what</hi>
a thing is? And, if the predicate compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
the <hi>full</hi> anſwer to that queſtion, 'tis
call'd a <hi>Species:</hi> but, if it only contains a
<hi>part,</hi> ſo that other common conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are comprehended under it, 'tis call'd
a <hi>Genus;</hi> whoſe compart or partner, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to the Species, anſwers not directly to
the queſtion <hi>What?</hi> but, with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>what kind</hi> or <hi>what in particular?</hi>
ſuppoſing the anſwer to the queſtion <hi>What</hi>
already made by the Genus: and this is
call'd a <hi>Difference.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. The other kind of Predication is
apply'd to ſome things <hi>neceſſarily</hi> conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with the Subject, which are call'd
<hi>Properties:</hi> and are ſtrictly ſuch, if they
appertain to it <hi>alone</hi> and <hi>alwaies;</hi> but,
more at large, if they be deficient in theſe
conditions. Sometimes 'tis apply'd to
things, which may be both joyn'd to and
ſeparated from the Subject, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
it; and ſuch are call'd <hi>Accidents.</hi>
Thus are there five, commonly call'd,
<hi>Predicables,</hi> or <hi>Porphyries five Terms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. But, ſince Notions are not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
but by the means of Words; and
the ſame word ſometimes is apply'd to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115975:22"/>
Notions, ſometimes to one only: as
oft as the ſame word, in the ſame ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is, meaning the ſame Notion, is
apply'd to more, 'tis ſaid to ſignifie or be
ſpoken <hi>Vnivocally.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. A word which ſerves for ſeverall No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
has this property either <hi>by chance,</hi>
as when in one Language it ſignifies one
thing, in others another; and then 'tis
call'd purely <hi>Equivocall:</hi> or elſe, of <hi>ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi>
'tis transferr'd from one Notion to
another; and then 'tis <hi>Equivocall by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. And, of this kind are thoſe words
which, by neceſſity or upon occaſion, are
transferr'd from one Notion to another,
by reaſon of the Connection of the two
Notions or things, or in conſideration of
their being Cauſe and Effect to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
As, when <hi>healthfull,</hi> which ſignifies
the <hi>quality</hi> of that temper which is juſt fit
and convenient to a ſenſitive Creature, is
transferr'd to ſignifie the quality of <hi>Vrine,</hi>
becauſe ſuch a quality in it is the effect of
a due temper in the Creature; or to <hi>Meat,</hi>
becauſe it preſerves and produces that fit
temper: Or elſe <hi>for Proportion</hi> ſake: ſo the
expreſſion, <hi>to ſtand at the Helm,</hi> is transferr'd
from a Ship to the Governour of a City; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115975:22"/>
according to proportion, he does
that in the City which a Pilot does in a Ship.</p>
                     <p>7. And, in ſuch kind of words, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſignification includes the former: as,
if you would explicate Urine as health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
you muſt ſay, 'tis ſuch an Urine as is
the ſign of health in the ſenſitive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
if, the Governour of a City as <hi>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at the Helm</hi> you muſt ſay, 'tis he that
does that in a City which a Pilot does in a
Ship. Theſe words are ſaid <hi>Analogically,</hi>
or by <hi>Analogy,</hi> to ſignifie more things.</p>
                     <p>8. And thus the word <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Being</hi>
is extended to thoſe ten lines or Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
before explicated: For, ſince a <hi>Thing</hi>
is that which has a being, the firſt Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alone juſtly challenges to it ſelf the
title of a Thing in this ſignification; that is,
as Thing ſignifies An individual ſubſtance,
which <hi>Aristotle</hi> call's the <hi>first Substance, Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum</hi>
or <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> &amp;, in rationall Subſtances,
the <hi>Perſon;</hi> for theſe names ſignify the ſame.</p>
                     <p>9. Whereas the reſt have no <hi>being,</hi> but
are only <hi>Affections</hi> and certain <hi>determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of what has a being: for example, Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
or Callias to be Men, is to have a <hi>being</hi> &amp; to
be <hi>Subſtances;</hi> but Callias<hi>'s</hi> being of the <hi>ſame
Nature</hi> with Socrates, which we call a <hi>relation
of identity,</hi> is not at all diſtinct from them, &amp;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115975:23"/>
conſequently can have no being but in
them, and that their being; yet, 'tis not
according to this Notion that They have
their being: This Identity, therefore,
has a being, not becauſe it, according to
its own notion, gives a being, or is that
whereby a thing has a being; but, becauſe
'tis a Notion which explicates a thing,
that, according to <hi>another Notion,</hi> has a
being.</p>
                     <p>10. Hence it appears why a conſequence
holds <hi>negatively,</hi> from a <hi>Subſtance</hi> to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things; but <hi>poſitively,</hi> from other
things to a <hi>Subſtance:</hi> For, that which <hi>is
not,</hi> can neither be the whole nor part of a
Thing; and, if it be a part or a whole, if
fitted to its Own Nature, if apply'd to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
certainly <hi>it is.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. Tis as evident, if any never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
mutation be made in the Subſtance,
the whole is chang'd: for, the Subſtance
being that Notion whereby the thing is
what it is; and every mutation in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
changing that Notion; by every
change made in the Subſtance, that is
chang'd whereby this thing is, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
this very thing.</p>

                     <p>1. TO know whether a word be
ſpoken univocally of more
things, we muſt look whether
it be predicated, ſtill, according to the
ſame Notion: now, a Notion is evidenc'd
by a <hi>Definition.</hi> A Definition, therefore, is
a ſpeech compos'd of more Notions, which,
taken together, make up that one Notion
which before was not known.</p>
                     <p>2. Since, therefore, a Definition is the
very Notion defin'd, reſolved, as it were,
into parts: 'tis clear, it can neither be more
ample nor narrower then that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd.</p>
                     <p>3. Again; 'tis plain, that, to ask a Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
is nothing but asking what they
mean, who underſtandingly uſe a word:
wherefore, ſince ſome words expreſſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that are common to all mankind (as,
thoſe of the ten Predicaments) 'tis evident
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115975:24"/>
that, in theſe and ſuch like, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
what the <hi>common-People,</hi> who
make up mankind, mean by ſuch a word.</p>
                     <p>4. But, of <hi>Proper Names</hi> and Terms ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to any Diſcipline, to ask the
Definition is to ask, what the <hi>Maſters</hi> of
that Diſcipline mean by ſuch a word? for
theſe are, as it were, the Creatours and
Cauſes of the words.</p>
                     <p>5. Again, 'tis evident, he that asks a
Definition ought to collect the <hi>uſuall ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
of the intelligent uſers of this word,
that concern the thing as 'tis expreſſed by
this word: which, if they be all gather'd,
'tis as demonſtrable the Definition is made
right, as any cauſe can be demonſtrated
from its effects; ſince, 'tis plain, thoſe
<hi>ſayings</hi> depend from the notion of the
word as from their <hi>cauſe,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Notion of neceſſity appears in
them.</p>
                     <p>6. But, if it happen to appear out of
ſuch ſayings, that the word has more ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications
then one; amongſt thoſe that
are made <hi>by deſign,</hi> it will eaſily be ſeen
which is the <hi>principall,</hi> becauſe that ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
will be included in all the reſt: as,
the <hi>ſoundneſſe</hi> of Meat or Urine include the
ſoundneſſe of an Animal.</p>

                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:115975:24"/>
7. Again, ſince thoſe things which are
demonſtrated concerning another are, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the <hi>thing it ſelf,</hi> or elſe are <hi>effects</hi> or
<hi>cauſes</hi> of it; both which appear in the
thing it ſelf, and are conformable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to it: now, a Definition explicates the
thing it ſelf: 'tis clear, that whatſoever is
demonſtrable of the thing is rooted in the
very Definition: Whence, a Definition is
a certain <hi>principall Inſtrument</hi> of <hi>Science;</hi>
and all the ſolutions of difficulties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
chiefly upon Definitions.</p>
                     <p>8. To make a Definition right, the Art
of <hi>Diſtinguishing</hi> muſt be learnt. For, a
<hi>Term</hi> being propoſ'd to be defin'd, out of
what has been ſaid, 'tis eaſie to find in what
Predicament 'tis: which once known, all
that remains is, by <hi>dividing</hi> the <hi>Genus,</hi> to
deſcend by degrees, till you come to the
particular in queſtion; when, preſently,
you have the Definition. And if, as it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
happens, many ſeverall <hi>Genus's</hi> have
a ſhare in the thing to be defin'd; this
ſame courſe is to be purſu'd through them
all.</p>
                     <p>9. But care muſt be taken, to divide by
<hi>proper</hi> differences, that is, ſuch as include
in them the thing to be divided; ſeeing
they are nothing elſe but more or leſſe of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115975:25"/>
the very <hi>Genericall Notion:</hi> for <hi>accidentall</hi>
differences are infinite, and beſides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of him that asks for a Definition.</p>
                     <p>10. Have a care, alſo, the Diviſion be
made <hi>by Contradiction,</hi> that is, into parts
contradictory one to another; for ſo the
Divider may be ſure he <hi>comprehends</hi> the
whole <hi>Genus.</hi> Laſtly, theſe rules being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
the fewer <hi>Members</hi> there are, that
is, parts into which the <hi>Genus</hi> is divided,
the more exactly you proceed. That <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,</hi>
too, whereby <hi>Accidents</hi> are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht
from their <hi>Subject,</hi> is very uſefull to
<hi>Sciences:</hi> for, when it appears that a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete,</hi>
that is, a thing which comprehends
ſeverall parts or Notions, is the Cauſe of
any effect, by this Diviſion you come to
that Notion, according to which, <hi>preciſely,</hi>
'tis the cauſe; which muſt neceſſarily be
connected with the effect, ſimply ſpeaking,
and conſequently, the effect may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
out of it <hi>à priori:</hi> For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
if it be known that <hi>Policletus</hi> made a
Statue; ſeparating the <hi>Accidents,</hi> 'twill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that he made it, not as White, nor as
Muſicall, nor as Policletus, but as one
<hi>skill'd</hi> in ſuch an <hi>Art;</hi> and hence you'l
collect, that All skilfull in that Art can
make a Statue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:115975:25"/>
11. Out of a Diviſion and Definition
made aright, there ariſe two ſorts or <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
of <hi>ſelf-evident</hi> propoſitions: For, as
oft as one of the Terms is a <hi>direct</hi> part of
the definition of another Term, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
is clear; as, if a Man be a <hi>Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Creature,</hi> he is a <hi>Creature:</hi> Again, in a
Diviſion truly made, 'tis plain, the parts
may diviſively be pronounc'd of the
whole; as, when we ſay, a Number is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Even or Odd.</hi> Whoever aſpires to <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi>
muſt be aſſiduous in theſe; but, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, in the practice of <hi>Defining;</hi> for,
all the connection of Notions is found in
Definitions, and the connection of Terms
is that which makes <hi>Science.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. Theſe, too, chiefly detect the ſnares
of Equivocall terms, which are the very
Bane of Science; eſpecially thoſe which
are caus'd by <hi>Analogy.</hi> Now, Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is diſplay'd, by looking into words
what way ſoever connected; as, into Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
effects, contraries, ſuperiours, inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
&amp;c. wherein, if once any thing be
found, which agrees to one and not to the
other, the Equivocation is diſcover'd: As,
if a Voice and a Saw be both ſaid to be
<hi>sharp,</hi> but the <hi>Contrary</hi> to the Voice is flat,
to the Saw, blunt; 'tis plain that <hi>sharp</hi> is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115975:26"/>
not predicated of them both in the ſame
ſignification, and therefore 'tis equivocall.</p>
                     <p>13. As for our modern Diſputes, 'tis
to be obſerv'd, that the Defendant either
puts a falſe Concluſion; or, if it be true, he
holds another incoherent with it; or, at
leaſt, if there be no oppoſition among his
Tenets, yet he is ignorant of the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and Conſequents to his Theſis; or,
laſtly, he is perfect only at this Theſis. In
the two firſt caſes, he may be convinc'd, if
the Diſputant behave himſelf well: in the
third, too, if the Diſputant can bring him
about to yield to ſome falſity in thoſe
things he is ignorant of, he may eaſily
convince him.</p>
                     <p>14. In the fourth caſe, one muſt diſpute
<hi>Critically,</hi> that is, either ſomething afarre
off muſt be ſought for, and forreign to the
Queſtion, which the Defendant is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to be skilfull in; and clapping Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
on the back on't, to fright him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the admiſſion of a falſity; which is the
trick of moſt of thoſe that diſpute out of
Medium's from Theology and the Divine
Omnipotence: or elſe, one muſt argue out
of common and logicall Notions, in which
both the terms are ambiguous, and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
eaſily hides it ſelf.</p>

there's no farther doubt but a Body or
Magnitude is diviſible without end.</p>
                     <p>2. Whence it follows, that one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
in quantity, added to another, makes
it not bigger: For, if it did, a finite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115975:27"/>

                     <p>3. Again: ſince any Multitude encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
by the addition of one to thoſe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſuppos'd, ev'n though 'twere infinite:
and yet the addition of one indiviſible,
to whatever preſuppos'd number, makes

infinite multiplication of indiviſibles is
ſufficient to make quantity; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that a Body or bigneſſe is not
compos'd of infinite Indiviſibles.</p>
                     <p>4. Moreover, ſince 'tis manifeſt that, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
two parts <hi>actually exiſt</hi> in a Body or Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,
even all the parts into which a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is diviſible do actually preexiſt in it,
too; and ſince 'tis plain, if a Magnitude
were divided into all it were diviſible into,
the remains would be purely infinite Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibles:
'tis perfectly manifeſt that no two

                     <p>5. 'Tis urg'd againſt the diviſibility of

anſwers, that an <hi>actuall infinite</hi> can never, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
be paſs'd over, but in an infinite time,
too: but that the parts of a Magnitude are
only, <hi>potentially, infinite;</hi> and, therefore, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hinders but they may be paſs'd over
in a finite time. <hi>Galilaeus</hi> replies, As any two
halfs do not, therefore, require leſſe time
to paſs them over, becauſe they are not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated:
ſo neither can infinite parts (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
them in a Magnitude) be paſs'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in leſſe time, becauſe they are but <hi>poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
then if they were <hi>actually</hi> or <hi>in effect.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. 'Tis anſwer'd, that if, in the potentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of a Magnitude, there were, <hi>really,</hi> infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
parts, whereof every one, limited in
themſelves and diſtinct from one another,
had a determinate bigneſſe; they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
require an infinite time to be paſs'd
over: But there's no ſuch matter: for, the
parts of a Magnitude have ſo undetermin'd
a quantity, that they may be bigger or leſs,
according to the proportion to the whole
wherein they are taken; whence, ſince, the
more are put, the leſſe they are, it comes to
paſſe that they never exceed a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
ſumme, which is the Magnitude
of the whole, how high ſoever they encreaſe
in Number.</p>
                     <p>7. Again: 'tis objected againſt this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115975:28"/>
of no parts being actually in a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude:
Firſt, that 'tis againſt the credit of
our Senſes, for, we ſee divers and ſeverall
parts of a Table or Stick; our hands, too,
and fingers are many.</p>
                     <p>8. 'Tis anſwer'd, by denying that we ſee
many parts of a Table or Stick: for, if we
ſaw they were ſeverall, our ſight could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
one from another, and we could
juſt tell where one ends and another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins:
ſince, therefore, the neareſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
parts are ſeparated, only by an Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
and an Indiviſible cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
by ſenſe; 'tis evident, it belongs
not to the Senſes to diſtinguiſh one part
from another.</p>
                     <p>9. And, whereas 'tis added, that we ſee
two Hands and many Fingers of the ſame
Man's: 'tis true, indeed; but a Hand or a
Finger ſignifies not a part <hi>actually,</hi> but in
<hi>potentia</hi> or poſſibility: For, if a Hand or
Finger were cut off from the reſt of the
Body, it were, now, no longer a Hand or
Finger, ſince it would be no more an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of <hi>taking</hi> any thing, which is of
the very definition of a Hand or Finger.</p>
                     <p>10. 'Tis objected, thirdly, thoſe are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
diſtinct, of which Contradictories can
be verifi'd: But, 'tis truly pronounced of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115975:28"/>
divers parts of a Magnitude, that <hi>this</hi> is
ſeen, toucht, hot, cut, &amp;c. whilſt the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories
to theſe are as truly ſaid of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part;</hi> nay, 'tis really true, that <hi>this part</hi>
is not <hi>that,</hi> as the Hand is not the Foot, an
Eye is not an Ear: Wherefore, theſe parts
muſt needs be actually diſtinct.</p>
                     <p>11. 'Tis anſwer'd, that Contradiction
is only in reſpect of our Underſtanding;
wherefore, the Contradictories have only
a <hi>notionall</hi> repugnance in the Subject, as it
is in <hi>our Vnderſtanding.</hi> Since then, the parts
have a diſtinct being in our Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
from thence 'tis that they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſuſtain Contradictories: Which to
make plain, inſtead of this Propoſition,
<hi>This part is ſeen, toucht, warm,</hi> &amp;c. let us
ſay, <hi>The thing, according to this part, is ſeen,
toucht, warm, &amp;c. and not according to that;</hi>
is it not clear the ſame thing ſuſtains Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories
as 'tis diverſly apprehended
by the Underſtanding, becauſe the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
by this reflection, <hi>according,</hi>
makes the ſame thing divers Subjects.</p>
                     <p>12. The like 'tis when we ſay, a hand is
not a foot: for it ſignifies that a Man as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the faculty of <hi>taking</hi> any thing, is not
a Man as having the faculty of <hi>walking.</hi>
And the ſame rule, we ſee, holds in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115975:29"/>
abſtracted Notions; for, though we ſay,
an Animall is rationall, yet we ſay, Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is not Rationality.</p>

Place.</head>
                     <p>1. PArts, then, not being actually in
a Magnitude, it follows, that <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion</hi>
or <hi>Diviſibility</hi> is not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
to it, but the very nature of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity:
Whence, we ſee, as oft as one asks,
<hi>how much</hi> there is of ſuch a thing; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
a way, a piece of Cloath, Liquour,
&amp;c. we anſwer, ſo many furlongs, ells,
ounces, &amp;c. that is, by the parts into which
they are diviſible. 'Tis plain, therefore, that
the very nature of Quantity is Diviſibility.</p>
                     <p>2. Hence, again, 'tis clear, that 'tis not
to be enquired how the parts of a Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
come to be united: for, ſince <hi>more</hi>
cannot be made of any thing, but what
firſt was <hi>not more,</hi> or, <hi>one;</hi> 'tis evident, that
what is diviſible is, in that very reſpect,
one; and out of the very nature of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
its parts derive an unity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:115975:29"/>
3. Nor is it leſſe manifeſt, that nothing,
beſides Quantity, is extended and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible:
for, 'tis not intelligible, that any
thing can be divided, and yet have no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibility:
Wherefore, that they call I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary
ſpace is nothing at all, nor has it
any diſtinguiſhable parts; much leſſe can
it be a means of diſtinguiſhing other
things, by its own diſtinction.</p>
                     <p>4. 'Tis objected, Before the Creation
of the World, there was a certain <hi>poſsibility</hi>
of a World; and a greater of the whole
world then of any part; nay, even now,
<hi>without</hi> or <hi>about</hi> this world, 'tis poſſible o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bodies ſhould be created, bigger
then this world: Yet, ſuch a Body cannot
be created, but ſome parts of it muſt be
more diſtant from this, then others:
Therefore, a greater and leſſe diſtance
from the world is imaginable; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
an Imaginary Space.</p>
                     <p>5. 'Tis anſwer'd, There is, indeed, a
poſſibility of ſuch a world: but, 'tis either
in the <hi>Power</hi> of God, and ſo is nothing
elſe but his very <hi>Eſſence;</hi> or, in the <hi>Idea</hi> of
ſome underſtanding Creature (and is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the mere <hi>conformity</hi> of the Predicate
with the Subject, or of one part with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
which ſaies, there is a world, or <hi>ſuch
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115975:30"/>
things</hi> agree well together. But, <hi>without</hi>
the world there is no diſtance, now; though
there would be, were any new Body crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
for, ſince <hi>Diſtance</hi> ſignifies extenſion
and parts; and a Body is compos'd of parts;
'tis plain, that, a Body being created, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
too, is created: But, to imagine Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
abſtracted from a Body is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt this firſt principle of Reaſon,
which denies that the ſame can be <hi>a Thing</hi>
and <hi>no-Thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. Again, 'tis evident, there's no ſuch thing
as a kind of infinite Magnitude or Vaſtneſs,
wherein all Bodies are: for bodies would
not be counter-extended with ſuch a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude;
&amp; conſequently, ſince Bodies are
Quantitative things, that would not be
ſuch.</p>
                     <p>7. Out of what has been ſaid, 'tis plain,
there is no <hi>empty place</hi> in the world; that is,
there is no hollow body, wherein there is
not another Body: for, it being determin'd,
that Diſtance is a Body; 'tis manifeſt that,
taking away Body, all Diſtance is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
Since, therefore, 'tis plain, that diſtant
things <hi>are joyn'd</hi> by taking away the diſtance;
if, out of a hollow body, that be taken away
which keeps the ſides aſunder, the ſides re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
conjoin'd, &amp; the Body is no longer
hollow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:115975:30"/>
8. Whence it appears, the wonder of thoſe
that ask, If all the Air ſhould be taken out
of a vaſt hollow ſphear, and nothing elſe
ſhould be done, what would follow? is irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall;
and ſignifies juſt as if they ſhould
ſay, If the ſides of the ſphear were joyn'd, &amp;
nothing elſe done, would they be joyn'd?</p>
                     <p>9. If, then, all quantitative things are
joyn'd together, they are <hi>Continu'd:</hi> For,
things continu'd are no otherwiſe, ſo, but,
in vertue of the Quantity, which is in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part: ſince, therefore, in theſe, there's
Quantity on either ſide; whatever quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
things are <hi>conjoin'd</hi> muſt be <hi>continu'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. Out of what has been ſaid, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Place</hi> is collected: For, it appears
to us, that is, to Mankind, that Place is an
<hi>immovable Veſſell,</hi> which ſome bodies go out
of and others enter into: moreover, that
the Earth is abſolutely immovable, and
that Heaven and the Starres obſerve a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
in their Motion, &amp; ſo give a ground,
on which the notion of immobility may
be founded; whence, a Veſſell, by reſpects
to a <hi>determinate</hi> part of the Earth &amp; of the
motion of the Heavens, will gain an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of immobility. To ſay, therefore, a
Body is in <hi>ſuch a place,</hi> is as much as to ſay,
'Tis in a Body which has <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſituation
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115975:31"/>
to the Earth and to the Heavens; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
'tis at ſuch a diſtance from ſuch a
Mountain, towards the beginning of <hi>Aries,</hi>
or the Sun-riſing.</p>
                     <p>11. And, that this is true, appears out
of thoſe explications of <hi>Place,</hi> whereby, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually,
anſwer is made to the Queſtion,
<hi>Where</hi> is ſuch a thing? For, we anſwer by
ſuch things as, in our apprehenſions, are
immoveable: in the laſt reſolution, by
the parts of the Heavens; next, by
Mountains, Rivers, Cities, Houſes, Trees,
&amp;c. and more immediately by Walls and
things faſtned to Walls, or rather, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
things within the Houſe, as
Beds, Cupboards, &amp;c. 'Tis plain, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that <hi>Place</hi> is the <hi>Body</hi> which <hi>next enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
the thing within it; as 'tis <hi>conceiv'd</hi> to
be in a certain ſite to the reſt of the world,
or its fixt parts.</p>
                     <p>12. You'l object, there's nothing <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
in the world, able to make a Place,
beſides <hi>Imaginary Space.</hi> 'Tis anſwer'd,
Place is a word, ſignifying according to
the will of the firſt impoſers, and therefore
ſignifies a <hi>thing</hi> as 'tis in our <hi>mind,</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Notion;</hi> wherefore, you muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſomething really immoveable, but
which may <hi>appear</hi> ſuch: Now, even Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115975:31"/>
it ſelf, if it be <hi>conſtantly</hi> the ſame, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to have a kind of immobility; and
ſo, 'tis ſufficient that the Sun conſtantly
riſes in one part and ſets in another, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
Place, without any need of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Space.</p>
                     <p>13. You'l object again, This Definition
does not agree with all things that are in
Place: for it neither agrees with Angels
or ſeparated ſouls, which yet, 'tis clear, are
in a Place; nor with the <hi>World</hi> it ſelf; nor
with <hi>Qualities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> or parts of <hi>Subſtance,</hi> which
are in a Place, too. We anſwer, 'tis clear
indeed that ſpirituall ſubſtances are in a
Place, but 'tis not clear what ſignifies, <hi>to be
in a Place,</hi> when we ſpeak of them: but
certain 'tis, that it ſignifies not, to be in a
Place after the manner of Bodies, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is, properly, to be in a Place; ſince
Mankind, to whom belongs the impoſing
the name of Place, never ſaw ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
'Tis as certain that, either the
world is not in a Place, or, if it be, (as ſome
endeavour to explicate,) 'tis by its parts;
that is, becauſe every part is in a Place, it
may, in a kind of forc'd ſenſe, be ſaid to be
in a Place. But, <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Qualities</hi> to be in
a Place, ſignifies they are the Forms and
Qualities of <hi>Bodies</hi> which are in a Place:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115975:32"/>
Whence, all theſe are ſaid to be in a Place
<hi>analogically,</hi> and not in their primary ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                     <p>14. Nor imports it, that the Vulgar
think that to have no being, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where:
for the Vulgar are not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer
of Sciences, as they are the impoſer
of Names: wherefore, we receive the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of Names from them, but not the
truth of Propoſitions.</p>
                     <p>15. Having determin'd then, that
Place is ſomething extrinſecall to the
thing in it; and ſeeing that an extrinſecall
change cannot be made <hi>without</hi> ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall
one, too, (ſince the extrinſecall
denomination is not <hi>another thing,</hi> different
from the intrinſecall quality of the things
which concurre to the denomination) in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
change of Place, ſome intrinſecall
Mutation muſt of neceſſity intervene: But,
the change of Place is, immediately, a
change of the application of the ſides of
the thing moved, from the ſides of the
Place whence it parts, to the ſides of the
Place whether it paſſes: wherefore, the
Place and the Thing in it being, really, the
ſame quantitative thing, we muſt ſay that
Locall Motion <hi>materially,</hi> is Diviſion, that
is, the firſt and, principall act of Quantity
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115975:32"/>
or Diviſibilty; and, <hi>formally,</hi> the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of a new ſite of the Univerſe, as has
been declared.</p>
                     <p>16. It follows, out of what has been ſaid,
that, ſince 'tis of the very Nature of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
to have its parts extended and one out
of or beyond another, 'tis impoſſible two
Bodies ſhould be in the ſame Place; for ſo,
one, in reſpect to the other, ſhould not
have the Nature of Quantity: As alſo, if the
ſame Body were ſituated in two Places;
ſince 'twould make a double diſtance, it
would have the force and effect of two
Quantities, that is, be double it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>17. The objections againſt theſe Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are Theologicall, &amp; not hard in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy;
&amp; therefore, are to be referr'd thither.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of Time and Locall Motion.</head>
                     <p>1. NOw, among Locall-Motions, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
the Motion of the Heavens,
eſpecially of the Sun and Moon,
is moſt notorious and common to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
as alſo, (at leaſt, to our apprehenſions)
moſt conſtant &amp; equall: Wherefore, tis the
fitteſt &amp; beſt qualifi'd for the meaſuring of
other Motions: &amp; ſo, experience teaches,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115975:33"/>
that 'tis apply'd to this uſe; for the How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Days, Years, &amp;c. are certain parts of
the Motion of the Sun.</p>
                     <p>2. This motion therefore, as 'tis made
uſe of for the <hi>meaſuring</hi> other motions, we
call <hi>Time:</hi> and, comparing motion to
Time, we ſay, one is ſwifter or ſlower then
another.</p>
                     <p>3. You'l object, this is an ill Definition
of Time: for, before the World was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
there was Time; and yet, no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Heavens. If the Sun, too,
ſhould ſtand ſtill, Time would not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ceaſe to paſſe on: Wherefore, Time
is not the Motion of the Heavens. 'Tis
anſwer'd, Before the creation of the
World, there was no time; however we
may imagine Time before the World, as
we do Place out of the World: but theſe
Opinions are ill grounded in the Fancy.
And, if the Sun ſhould ſtand ſtill, 'tis plain,
there would be no Daies and Years, &amp;c.
that is, if it ſhould ſtand ſtill for ever; for,
if it ſtood but for a little while, it would
only make the Day longer. But, 'tis to be
obſerv'd, that the Motion of the Heavens
is not Time, as it is in <hi>it ſelf,</hi> but as it is the
Object of <hi>our apprehenſions;</hi> whereby we
form a certain quantity of Motion, which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115975:33"/>
we may apply to all other Motions, and
even to the Motion of the Sun it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>4. To the queſtion, therefore, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time would paſſe on were the Sun or
Heavens immoveable? 'tis anſwer'd that,
abſtracting from our apprehenſions, it
would not: but, becauſe there would
ſtill remain in us a power of meaſuring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Motions, by the Motion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
which we formerly apprehended; we
ſhould meaſure Motions by Time paſſing
on in its <hi>Eſſence,</hi> not in <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> that is, by
the Notion and Nature, not the actuall
Preſence of Time. <hi>Time,</hi> therefore, would
not, really, paſſe on; yet we ſhould make
uſe of it as if it did.</p>
                     <p>5. You'l object again, The Motion of
the Heavens is diviſible, as the ſpace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are mov'd: But Time conſiſts of
<hi>Indiviſibles;</hi> for, It has no true being but
the <hi>preſent,</hi> which is alwaies indiviſible.
'Tis anſwer'd, Time is diviſible without
end, juſt as Motion is: But, what is ſaid,
that nothing of Time is preſent but an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi>
is falſe; for, we ſay, the preſent Day,
Year, Age, &amp;c. for, Time being Motion,
as in our apprehenſions, the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
can make as much of it preſent as
it pleaſes, by taking a whole part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115975:34"/>
the manner of one Entity.</p>
                     <p>6. But an indiviſible part of Time is
never preſent; for, there is no ſuch thing:
the working, only, of our Underſtanding
makes Inſtants, not as a part of Time, but
as the end of one part and the beginning
of another: Whence, we never conceit
an inſtant In Time or Motion, but when
we mean there is <hi>no more</hi> Time or Motion,
An Inſtant, therefore, is a kind of <hi>not-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of Time: Wherefore, what's ſaid, that
nothing of Time is preſent but an Inſtant,
is to be underſtood, that Nothing of Time
is preſent together and at once, becauſe its
nature is <hi>Succeſsive;</hi> nor can it have any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence,
as a kind of Thing or Being, but
as the variation of a diviſible Thing as 'tis
diviſible.</p>
                     <p>7. Again; it being apparent, that ſome
things are more eaſie, others harder to be
divided, or (which is the ſame) ſome are
more, others leſſe diviſible: if that which
cauſes the Motion forces a leſſe againſt a
more diviſible, the more diviſible muſt of
neceſſity be cut aſunder, and admit in the
leſſe diviſible between its parts: wherefore,
a Diviſion will be made, and conſequently,
if the other requiſites concurre, a Locall
Motion; for, the leſſe diviſible will change
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115975:34"/>
its place. If, therefore, the ſame leſſe diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
be impell'd, with the ſame force, againſt
any thing more diviſible then the former;
'twill ſeparate it in leſſe time, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
'twill be mov'd faſter.</p>
                     <p>8. Now, the leſſe diviſible is call'd, <hi>Denſe;</hi>
the more, <hi>Rare:</hi> and, becauſe Diviſibility
is the very nature of Quantity, the rare
will have more, the denſe leſſe of Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
and theſe are the <hi>firſt</hi> differences that
can be expected in a <hi>Quantum</hi> or Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
they being made by <hi>more</hi> and <hi>leſſe</hi> of
Quantity in a quantitative Thing.</p>
                     <p>9. But, becauſe, out of what has been
ſaid, it appears that the <hi>rare,</hi> in reſpect of
the <hi>denſe,</hi> is that which is diviſible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily,
the denſe is the divider: by how
much greater the proportion of denſity is
in the divider, to the rarity of what is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
by ſo much the diviſion muſt needs
be quicker, and the Motion ſwifter.</p>
                     <p>10. In like manner it is, too, for matter
of the <hi>Figure</hi> or ſhape: for, one figure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
apter to divide then another, (ſince,
we ſee Artificers chuſe ſharp figures to cut
with) by how much the figure is more apt
(ſuppoſing all other circumſtances pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable)
ſo much ſwifter the Motion
will be.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:115975:35"/>
11. Laſtly; becauſe, in denſe things
of the ſame figure, the compariſon of den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to the figure is greater in great things,
(becauſe, in Bodies, the <hi>Solid</hi> is multiply'd
in a triple proportion,<note place="margin">Euclid. El. 6. Pr. 19. El. 12. Pr. 18.</note> but
the <hi>Superficies</hi> only in a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
that is, of two ſimilary
Globes, &amp;c. if their Diameters
be as 2 to 3, their <hi>Solids</hi> will be as 8 to 27,
but their <hi>Superficies</hi> only as 4 to 9.) it
comes to paſſe that, (other circumſtances
being ſuppos'd equall) of bodies that are
alike, the greater move ſwifter then the
leſſe. It appears, therefore, that, in reſpect
to the ſame <hi>Medium,</hi> there are three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
in a <hi>Moveable,</hi> which make the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſwifter, viz. bigneſſe, denſity and
figure.</p>
                     <p>12. It follows, out of what has been
ſaid, that there can be no Motion in an
inſtant, by an Agent of a finite power:
for, the ſpace wherein 'tis made being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
without end; if the motion were
in an inſtant, the Agent could move the
movable through a ſpace aſſign'd, while
the power which moves the Sun could not
move that never ſo little a ſpace: ſince,
therefore, ſpace may diminiſh without
end, 'tis neceſſary the <hi>power</hi> be encreas'd
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115975:35"/>
without end, and conſequently, be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</p>
                     <p>13. Again; ſince a greater power is
requir'd to move the <hi>ſame</hi> movable more
ſwiftly through the ſame <hi>Medium;</hi> a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
cannot be transferr'd from a leſſe to
a greater degree of velocity, in an inſtant,
by a finite Agent: For, ſince ſome power
is requiſite to give it a greater velocity, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the ſame time; and the proportion
of time to an inſtant is infinite; the power
to give it ſuch a velocity, in an inſtant,
muſt be infinite.</p>
                     <p>14. Whence, 'tis evident, that every
Movable which is rais'd from reſt to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
paſſes through infinite degrees of
ſlowneſſe, greater then that degree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
we ſuppoſe it to be arrived. For, ſince
every aſſign'd degree is diviſible into infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
ones which are between it and reſt, nor
can a finite Agent raiſe the Movable from
any of thoſe to an aſſign'd degree, in an
inſtant; much leſſe can it transferre it
from reſt to an aſſign'd degree in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.
Conſequentially to theſe poſitions,
Every movable that is reduc'd from reſt
to motion, at the beginning, increaſes in
velocity: but, ſince to every finite Agent,
there correſponds a certain determinate
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115975:36"/>
degree of Effect, beyond which it has no
power; when it arrives once to that degree
of velocity, it will ſtand at it, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will encreaſe no farther.</p>
                     <p>15. But if, to the difficulty of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
there be added an Agent moving a
contrary way; according to that Agents
power the velocity of the former movable
will be diminiſht, or the movable be even
forc'd to reſt, or to an oppoſite Motion.
And thus it appears how Motions begin
and end.</p>
                     <p>16. Laſtly, it may be concluded, <hi>ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively</hi>
ſpeaking, that any weight whatever
may be mov'd an aſſign'd ſpace, by never
ſo little a power: For, ſince the power
muſt, of neceſſity, be multiply'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the velocity; as much as it fails in
velocity, ſo much may be abated in the
power. Aſſigning therefore a Bulk to be
mov'd and a power to move it; ſuppoſe
another power which may be able, in a
certain time, to move this bulk ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
ſpace; and, by how much this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
power is greater then the firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd,
ſomuch encreaſe the time in
which the movable ſhould be mov'd
through the propos'd ſpace; and becauſe,
now, the effect is ſo much leſſe, it will
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115975:36"/>
not exceed the power aſſigned.</p>
                     <p>17. I ſaid, this is ſpeculatively true:
becauſe, when one ſhould go about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it to practice, an extremely little
power could not be preſerv'd ſo long time,
as were neceſſary to the effect.</p>

                     <p>1. OUt of what has been ſaid, it being
concluded that <hi>Rare</hi> and <hi>Denſe</hi> are
the firſt Differences, and that they by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
like Quantity, are varied with
endleſſe Differences; ſeeing, too, that there
is a perpetuall Tumult as it were, in the
world, of heavy things deſcending towards
the Centre of the Earth: there muſt, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
be ſome degree of rare Bodies ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
diviſible, that it needs nothing, but this
very impulſe, to ſeparate their parts, &amp; carry
them, the neareſt way to the Centre.</p>
                     <p>2. Such bodies, therefore, will ſpread
themſelves <hi>without any limits</hi> about the
Earth, unleſſe they be hindred; whence,
they'l have <hi>no proper figure</hi> of their own:
but when they encounter with a den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
body, upon which the impulſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115975:37"/>
that divides them, has not the like power;
there they'l ſtop their diviſion, and receive
a figure from that.</p>
                     <p>3. They will, therefore, be eaſily ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
by others bounds, hardly by their
own: But, on the contrary, Bodies, upon
which the motion of gravity has not ſuch
force, will be eaſily terminable by their
own bounds, hardly by others. Now, this,
Nature and Ariſtotle have aſſign'd for the
notion of Dryneſſe, that, of Moyſture;
wherefore, theſe will be dry bodies, thoſe
moiſt.</p>
                     <p>4. It appears, therefore, both that all
bodies, that have a Conſiſtency, are dry;
and that, if there be any ſo rare, that, by
all others, it will be repell'd from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
(that is, rare in the higheſt degree)
that, too, is dry; for, its parts take not
eaſily their ply, that is, are not ſpread by
the falling of heavy bodies, but are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their own Motion: Yet, that which
is denſe in the higheſt degree will be more
dry; becauſe the rareſt receiv's a figure
partly from thoſe without it, partly from
it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>5. But, among moiſt bodies, that which
is rarer is moiſter; as more yielding to
the gravity which divides it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:115975:37"/>
6. You'l object, that Duſt and Fire ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
themſelves to the bounds of
other bodies; and, therefore, muſt be
moiſt. 'Tis anſwer'd, Duſt is not one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but many: beſides, it does not ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
it ſelf; ſince, if it lye free, a
heap of Duſt is full of Aire, by which it is
rendred ſo eaſily plyable. Fire, too, has a
proper motion, and is reflected, when
forc'd by a hard body; nor does it who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accommodate it ſelf, as appears in light
and the flames of Furnaces.</p>
                     <p>7. Again; ſince, by the ſame motion
of heavy bodies, rare ones muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be preſſ'd againſt denſe, and denſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
rare: if a very rare body be ſo
forc'd againſt a denſe, that it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
to make its way; ſince, 'tis diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
into minuteſt parts, and 'tis eaſier to
make a narrow then a wide way; 'tis plain,
the rare body will bore it ſelf a world of
little paſſages and paths, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
will diſſect the denſe, which oppoſes it,
into an infinity of little parts.</p>
                     <p>8. Whence, it follows, that, if there
were many <hi>heterogene</hi> bodies, (that is, of a
different nature) ſhut up in the denſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
all, now being ſet at liberty, by ſuch
diſſection, will, by their proper motions,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115975:38"/>
gather themſelves to their own <hi>Parties,</hi> and
be ſeparated, every one, from thoſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
kind.</p>
                     <p>9. But if a denſe body compreſſe a rare
one, 'twill let nothing ſcape out of it; but,
whatever if finds, it condenſes and crowds
into a narrower room.</p>
                     <p>10. Denſe bodies, therefore, have this
nature, to gather together heterogene bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
that is, they are <hi>cold:</hi> and Rare bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
to gather together homogene (or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the ſame kind,) but to diſperſe he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogene;
that is, they are <hi>hot.</hi> For, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

of hot and cold.</p>
                     <p>11. And among rare bodies, 'tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
the rareſt will be the beſt dividers,
that is, the hoteſt: but, among denſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
thoſe will be the coldeſt, which moſt

thoſe are ſuch as are moſt plyant to their
parts; whence, they which are, in ſome

body, cold, in the higheſt degree, but
temperately moiſt.</p>
                     <p>2. Theſe ſame bodies, in as much as

chang'd, thus, in Name, not Nature.</p>
                     <p>3. This property alſo, of an Element,
they have, that they cannot be compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

4. You'l object; Since Rare and Denſe
vary the Quantity, by the very nature of
Quantity there will be infinite degrees;
and, thence the number of the Elements
will neither be four nor, indeed, finite.
'Tis anſwer'd; Men do not determine the

                     <p>5. Thus, therefore, a Rare body, which

Denſe body, which abſolutely excludes
light, we term <hi>Earth:</hi> One that partly

<hi>Water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. Not, that wiſe men eſteem theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bodies to be truly Elements, which we
are converſant with round about us: But
that, theſe <hi>mixt</hi> bodies obtain that name,
out of the <hi>predominancy</hi> of ſome Element
in them, which they would deſerve, if,
drein'd from all dregs, they were entirely
refin'd into the nature of the Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                     <p>7. The Elements, therefore, are Bodies
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115975:39"/>
diſtinguiſht, purely, by the differences of
rare and denſe: and they are collected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
four kinds or heads, under the terms
we have given them.</p>
                     <p>8. Moreover, 'tis evident, that no
bounds or figures do, properly, belong
to the Elements, out of their own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
that is, preciſely by their own nature:
for, ſince they are nothing but quantita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
bodies, affected with <hi>ſuch</hi> a rarity or
denſity; the nature of Quantity ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
which is every where diviſible and
terminable, and conſequently, figurable
as one pleaſes.</p>
                     <p>9. But, whether there be not ſome
greateſt <hi>poſsible</hi> bulk in every one of the
Elements, out of the very nature of denſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
depends upon Metaphyſicall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
Nevertheleſſe, out of their common
operation, a <hi>Sphericall</hi> figure is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Earth and Fire. To Fire, becauſe
its nature being to diffuſe it ſelf, with the
greateſt celerity, out of a little matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a great breadth, it muſt of neceſſity
ſpread it ſelf on all ſides, that is, into a
Sphear.</p>
                     <p>10. To Earth, as being the <hi>Baſis</hi> &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
about which moiſt bodies diffuſe
themſelves; and, by ſo doing, mold it into
a Globe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:115975:40"/>
11. But, that Fire flames up like a Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid,
proceeds from the reſiſtance of the
Aire incompaſſing it, which 'tis forc'd to
penetrate with a ſharp point.</p>
                     <p>12. Again; ſince the Elements are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to one another, only by the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of rare and denſe: 'tis evident, their
tranſmutation into one another is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but <hi>rarefaction</hi> and <hi>condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. 'Tis plain, too, that denſe things,
being forc'd againſt rare, do compreſſe
them, and, if there be no way to eſcape,
do neceſſarily condenſe them: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſation,
if it be enough both in time
and degree, will, of neceſſity, change that
which is condens'd, into that Element to
which ſuch a denſity is proper.</p>
                     <p>14. But, a rare body compreſſ'd, if it
get out, diffuſes it ſelf a main out of thoſe
ſtraights: whence, if any denſe body, that
is rarifiable, ſtick to it, it carries it away
with it, and rarifies it: 'Tis plain, therefore,
that 'twill turn it into the nature of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
Element; if the other circumſtances
concurre which are neceſſary to Action.</p>
                     <p>15. Out of all which, we may collect,
that one Element cannot be chang'd into
another, without being transferr'd
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115975:40"/>
through all the intermediate degrees: as
if you ſhould endeavour to rarifie Earth
into Fire; firſt you muſt raiſe it into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then into Aire, and at length into
Fire.</p>
                     <p>16.<note place="margin">Leſs. 3.</note> For, as we have demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
above,<note place="margin">Numb. 13.</note> concerning velocity,
that a Movable cannot be raiſ'd
out of one into another determinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
but in time: ſo, with the ſame la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
the ſame may be made evident, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
denſity; ſince, the nature of
Quantity is equall and conſtant in both;
and Velocity is nothing but A certain
<hi>denſity</hi> of Motion.</p>

                     <p>1. SInce that part of the world, which
is expos'd to our knowledge, is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite;
and any never-ſo-little
bulk infinitely repeated, exceeds the
greateſt poſſible: it follows, that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115975:41"/>
ſome actually <hi>the leaſt:</hi> nay, that, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the order of the World, bodies
cannot be divided beyond a certain term.</p>
                     <p>2. There will be, therefore, in each of
the Elements certain minuteſt parts,
which are, either not at all, or very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
farther diviſible. When, therefore,
the Elements are forc'd one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the ſides of the rare ones muſt, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
become united with the ſides of
the denſe: but, when they come to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
again, 'tis impoſſible they ſhould
not leave ſome of thoſe minuteſt parts
ſticking to the denſe bodies.</p>
                     <p>3. For, ſince, in the ſame Quantity,
the denſe part is leſſe diviſible then the
rare; that, too, which is compounded of
rare and denſe, in the ſame bulk, is leſſe
diviſible then the rare part of the ſame
quantity: It muſt needs be, therefore,
that the rare Elements muſt ſtick, by their
minuteſt parts, to the denſe which they
have once touch't.</p>
                     <p>4. Hence, 'tis evident, that the minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
parts being rub'd off on every ſide,
by the ouching together of divers Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>mixt bodies</hi> muſt neceſſarily be
made. For, if two denſe parts touch one
minuteſt rare; ſince the minuteſt is indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115975:41"/>
there naturally emerges a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound</hi>
of the three, as hardly diviſible as are
the denſe ones themſelves.</p>
                     <p>5. Whence, we have the firſt Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of bodies: For, ſince the Elements are
four, and may be joyn'd together by big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or leſſe parts; as oft as great parts of
one Element redound, the body is call'd
by the name of that Element.</p>
                     <p>6. Thus have we ſeverall kinds of
Earth: and, in this ſenſe, all conſiſtent
things have the notion of Earth; all viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fluid things are call'd Waters; and
there are many kinds of Airs and Fires.</p>
                     <p>7. But, when a body, that has the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency
of one Element, is full of <hi>minute
parts</hi> of another; the ſubſtance of one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement
gets the denomination of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<hi>quality:</hi> Thence proceed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of temperaments, hot, cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
in one and the ſame kind, too, reduplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
differences of the Elements; <hi>viz.</hi> of
Earths, ſome are Earthy, ſome Watry,
ſome Aeriall, ſome Fiery; and ſo in the
reſt, ev'n to the loweſt <hi>ſpecies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. It appears, again, wherein conſiſt
thoſe qualities, which diſtinguiſh bodies,
as to their conſiſtency. Firſt, the notion
of liquid &amp; conſiſtent plainly follows the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115975:42"/>
nature of rare and denſe: and ſoft is a
middle between liquid and hard; but
hard, being that which reſiſts diviſion,
clearly refers to denſity.</p>
                     <p>9. But groſſe and Maſſive appertain to
the <hi>quantity</hi> of parts: for groſſe is not, ſo,
divided into minuteſt parts, as to be able,
by its ſubtilty, to enter into the leaſt
pores or crannies; and Maſſive has no
pores or paſſages in its body, but ſpeaks
parts conſtipated and thruſt cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Both of them plainly expreſſe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
notion of Denſity.</p>
                     <p>10. As for Fat, and tough, and viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous
or ſlimy, they have this common to
them all, To ſtick where they touch: but
fat, in leſſer parts; viſcous, in greater;
tough, properly, holds its own parts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and cleaves not ſo much to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                     <p>11. They, therefore, conſiſt of moiſt
and denſe well mixt: from moiſt they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
the facility to unite; from denſe, the
difficulty to be ſeparated.</p>

the Paſsion of mixt things.</head>
                     <p>1. THeſe things being ſuppos'd; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there are <hi>two Active</hi> quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
heat and cold, which are
moſt eminent in Fire and Water: let there,
firſt, be a mixt body of Earth, Water,
and Aire, upon which Fire be ſuppos'd to
act: and, ſince there is no mixt thing ſo
compacted, but, at leaſt, ſome parts of
Fire may be forc'd and fly away through
it; and they, in their paſſage, are joyn'd
to the parts of Aire or Water: 'tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
that the Fire will carry away ſome of
them with it; whence the Compound
will become more compacted and ſolid.</p>
                     <p>2. Again; becauſe the parts of Fire are
extremely ſubtile; whereever they find a
reſiſtance in the ſolid parts, weaker then
their power of dividing, that way they'l e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape,
and that, not alone, but laden with
watry or airy parts: ſo that they will leave
the Water and Aire to be united with
Earth and between themſelves, by the
ſmalleſt parts that are poſſible.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:115975:43"/>
3. Whence, two things come to paſſe:
One, that the Whole becomes a like and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
throughout, all the Elements being
mixt by moſt minute particles in every
part: The other, that the Elements become
leſſe diviſible from one another in this
whole; which is, to be rendred conſtant
and permanent body.</p>
                     <p>4. Let therebe, therefore, in another
body, the natures of Fire, Aire and Earth
blended together; to which let Water be
added from without: and, firſt, you'l ſee
all the <hi>ſallies</hi> block'd up, and the Pores
coagulated by vertue of the cold, ſo that
the Aire or Fire cannot eaſily ſteal out.</p>
                     <p>5. See, again, the Water with all its
weight and force, preſſing the neareſt
parts of the Compound on every ſide:
whence, they are forc'd to compreſſe and
ſtreighten themſelves, and ſhrink into a
leſſe and leſſe place, to make room for the
water; and this, not in the ſurface alone,
but even in the minuteſt parts, as far as the
water can pierce; which ſo much the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it can, as its parts are rendred more
ſubtile, by the re-active power of the Aire
and Fire.</p>
                     <p>6. Behold, therefore, its parts being,
even thus, condens'd, a conſiſtent and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115975:43"/>
hardly-diviſible body made; which is,
to be a certain naturall <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Phyſicall
mixt body.</p>
                     <p>7. Hence, again, the cauſes of <hi>paſsions</hi>
are apparent: for, we ſee ſome compounds
ſuffer from Fire a liquefaction and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
into minute particles; as, into Aſhes
and powder: others, on the contrary,
grow hard: others, again, converted into
Flame.</p>
                     <p>8. The reaſon whereof is clear: for, if
the power of the Fire extends it ſelf only
ſo far as to dilate the humid parts which
hold together the dry; it comes to paſſe
that the humid parts become larger and
more rare, and conſequently, the whole it
ſelf is rendred more diviſible and ſubject
to be diffus'd, by its own gravity, into the
beſt ply towards the Centre; which is, to
be liquid.</p>
                     <p>9. But, if the power of the Fire be ſo
great, as to carry away with it the humid
parts; then the denſe ones remain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
into minute particles, without a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
to unite them. And theſe operations
are effected, ſometimes by the mere
force of the fire it ſelf; ſometimes by
means of ſome inſtruments, whereby
the humid parts are either increas'd or
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115975:44"/>
decreas'd, according as the Artificer has
occaſion.</p>
                     <p>10. But, farther, if humid parts were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant
in the Compound, and Fire were
ſo far apply'd, as only to reſtrain the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
by exhaling thoſe parts which were
ſuperfluous; the connection of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid
with the Earthy parts will be leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvable,
and the proportion of the Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to the humid, greater; whence, the
Compound grows hard.</p>
                     <p>11. Water, too, by preſſing upon it,
pierces and enters into the Compound it
encompaſſes, ſheir's off its lighter and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
parts, which it mingles with the whole
dry body, and amplifies the humid parts:
whence, it makes the body flaccid and
looſe, and next door to diſſolution.</p>
                     <p>12. Some it utterly diſſolv's; as ſalts:
for, they are compos'd of certain minute
parts, betwixt which Water eaſily enters;
and, ſo little they are, that they ſwim in
the water. There becomes, therefore, a
kind of fluid body, thickned with little
heterogeniall bodies ſwimming in it; to
which if Fire be apply'd, by exhaling the
ſuperfluous humid parts, it remains ſalt,
as at firſt.</p>
                     <p>13. But, ſometimes it happens, that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115975:44"/>
ſomething is mix'd with the ſalt &amp; water,
which has a power of ſeparating the watry
parts from thoſe little ſwimming bodies,
and of preſſing down &amp; <hi>precipitating</hi> them
to the bottome: for, when the <hi>ſupervener</hi>
has aggregated to it ſelf the parts of that
humid body wherein the diſſolution was
made, that which was mixt with them (if it
be heavier then water) deſcends; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it was ſuſtain'd by its conjunction to
the water which was lighter.</p>
                     <p>14. There are bodies, too, which grow
harder and are <hi>petrify'd</hi> by the mixture of
water; either becauſe there wanted moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
to make them coagulate, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
in <hi>dry</hi> or <hi>ſandy</hi> bodies; or becauſe,
by the addition of the extrinſecall moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
the ſuperfluous humour is ſuck'd
out, in which their inward parts were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
and rendred flaccid; or, laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the pores of the Compound being
conſtipated without, the internall heat
better dries the inward parts.</p>
                     <p>15. But, when the redundant parts are ſo
very minute in themſelves that they are
eaſily rarifyable, they are diffus'd into
Flame. And theſe parts are ſuch as we call
fat or aiery, which conſiſt of a thin moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
compacted with minuteſt denſe parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:115975:45"/>
16. It falls out, too, that, when the fiery
parts within are many and happen upon a
convenient moiſture, they multiply and
encreaſe themſelves without any apparent
extrinſecall cauſe, and open themixt body
it ſelf, ſo that the Veſſell cannot contain it,
but it boyls and runs over; as we ſee in the
Muſt of wine and of other fruits: and this
kind of action is call'd <hi>Fermentation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>17. Sometimes, too, it blazes out in
Fire and Flame; as appears in Hay, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dry bodies moiſtned and crowded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
which comes to paſſe, by the fiery
parts of the dry'd bodies turning the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid
parts into fire, and, at length, by their
multitude and compreſſure, raiſing a
flame.</p>
                     <p>18. <hi>Paſsion</hi> or ſuffering from Earth is
when, either by its weight or ſome other
preſſure and hardneſſe, a change is made;
which, even by this, is underſtood to be a
<hi>diviſion,</hi> and, commonly, is wrought two
ways: For, either the parts of one body
are intirely ſeparated, by the interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of another body of another nature; or
elſe, only ſome are joyn'd to others of the
ſame nature, as it happens in liquids when
they are ſwaſh'd up and down.</p>
                     <p>19. The firſt of theſe diviſions is made
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115975:45"/>
ſeverall ways; by breaking, cutting, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
pounding, and the like; the other,
by hammering, drawing, impreſſion, ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
compreſſion, and the like: all which
appear in themſelves to be made, by the
motion of hard and denſe againſt ſoft and
rare bodies.</p>

                     <p>2. For, the Moderns have found out
how a Diamant may be reſolv'd to duſt,

Gold volatile: the Asbeſtus, in the very

and, when divided into hairs, is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
only a moderate one.</p>
                     <p>3. It appears, conſequentially, what
muſt neceſſarily follow, if fire be apply'd
to a confirm'd and eſtabliſht body: For,
ſince ſome parts of a Compound are moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
then the reſt, the firſt efficacy of the
fire will be exercis'd upon them; with
which, if there be any fiery parts mix'd,
thoſe firſt fly out with the fire, and are
call'd <hi>Spirits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. The next are the moiſt and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid
parts, and they are call'd <hi>Flegme:</hi>
Then, the more concocted parts, in which

they are call'd <hi>Oyls</hi> or <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> and need a
ſtrong fire to extract them.</p>
                     <p>5. That which remains uſes, by the
Chymiſts, to be waſht in water: wherein
they find a more ſolid part, which ſinks
down, and this they call <hi>Salt;</hi> and a lighter
part that ſwimms a top, which they throw
away as unuſefull; notwithſtanding, 'tis
dry in the higheſt degree, and very effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to <hi>fix</hi> fluid bodies.</p>
                     <p>6. But, if a Compound of theſe two be

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115975:46"/>
moiſture of the Salt is liquifi'd, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>7. Whence, 'tis clear, that theſe bodies
are in part, made, and, in part, reſolved or
extracted by the operation of Fire: and
that they are not Elements, but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds,
containing the nature of the
whole, as appears by Experience.</p>
                     <p>8. Out of what has been ſaid, it may be
underſtood, what a <hi>mixt</hi> body is, <hi>viz.</hi> A
body coagulated of rare and denſe parts,
in a determinate number, bigneſſe, and
weight.</p>
                     <p>9. And, when many ſuch unite into
one, a certain homogeneous ſenſible body
emerges, ſerviceable for mans uſe; though
it be ſeldome ſo pure, as to be unmixt with
others.</p>
                     <p>10. Hence, again, it appears, that it
concerns not a mixt body, of what <hi>Figure</hi>
it be: ſince, with the ſame proportion of
parts, it may be of any; eſpecially, when
one body is compos'd of many little ones.
All things, therefore, receive their figure
from the circumſtances of their Originati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:115975:47"/>
11. For, ſince the ſame things muſt be
produc'd after the ſame manner; and
thoſe that are divers, different ways: the
variety of manners occaſions the variety
of figures.</p>
                     <p>12. For, that which equally dilates eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way, becomes ſpherical; that which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
irregularly, becomes like a Bowl;
that which faints in growing longer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
like a Top.</p>
                     <p>13. That which cannot extend it ſelf in
length, becomes parallelly flat; that which
is, in ſome part, defective in breadth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a hexagon, a quadrate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that
which cannot dilate it ſelf in breadth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
oblong. And thus, at large, and in
generall, 'tis evident, whence proceed the
figures of mixt bodies.</p>

                     <p>1. FRom what has been ſaid we collect,
that, ſince the Sun either is Fire, or,
at leaſt, operates like fire, beating upon
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115975:47"/>
Earth, Water, and all other bodies, with
its Rayes; it ſummons out little bodies,
which, ſticking to its Rayes, are reflected
with them and mov'd from the Centre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Circumference.</p>
                     <p>2. By whoſe motion, all the reſt muſt,
of neceſſity, preſſe towards the Earth: and
becauſe the Motion of denſe bodies is ſo
much the ſtronger, the denſer they are;
and deſcending bodies, the more they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend,
the more they repell leſſe deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ones; there muſt be, wheree're the
Sun has any power, a Motion of denſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
towards the Centre and of rare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Circumference; as experience
teaches us there is.</p>
                     <p>3. Whence, firſt, we ſee, there can no
where be any <hi>pure</hi> Elements: ſince, at
leaſt, the Rayes of the Sun and the bodies
carry'd about with them are mingled eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where.</p>
                     <p>4. We ſee, too, that denſe bodies are
heavy, and contrarily, rare are light: and
that there is not any <hi>inclination</hi> requiſite in
bodies, towards the Centre; as is evident
by the experience of <hi>Pumps,</hi> by which, with
an eaſie motion, a great weight of water is
rais'd; or, as when we ſuck a Bullet out of
the barrell of a long Gun.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:115975:48"/>
5. We ſee, moreover, that, ſince this
<hi>tumult,</hi> of little bodies <hi>aſcending</hi> and <hi>deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
ſwarm's every where: place any body
in it, it muſt needs be preſs'd upon by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
every where about it; and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which are <hi>aſide</hi> on't, muſt perpetually
pierce and enter into it, if they find in it
lighter bodies which they can repell from
the Centre: Whence, this tumult is even
within all bodies, and, by vertue of it, all
bodies are mingled.</p>
                     <p>6. Whence, again, it muſt needs be, that
the thin parts of every body conſiſt in a
kind of perpetuall expiration; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
that every body, more or leſſe,
operates upon and affects other bodies
which approach it round about, or acts in
a Sphear; as we ſee by experience, in hot,
cold, odoriferous, poys'nous bodies, and
in Animals, &amp;c. Every body, therefore,
has a certain <hi>Sphear of activity,</hi> by this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and its action depends upon this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>7. Again, therefore, ſince its action is
not effected but by an <hi>emiſsion</hi> of its own
parts; 'tis plain, it cannot act upon a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>
thing, but by a <hi>Medium;</hi> as alſo, that
it <hi>ſuffers</hi> from that upon which it <hi>acts,</hi> if it
be within that's Sphear of activity: the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manations
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115975:48"/>
of the one running, by lines
different, from the emanations of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>8. Again, 'tis evident, that, ſince theſe
<hi>emanations</hi> are certain minuteſt particles;
in a denſer body more will ſtick to its
parts, becauſe its pores are narrow and
hard to paſſe through: wherefore, with
greater labour and time, and at the coſt of
more little particles, a denſe body receiv's
the nature and ſimilitude of the body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
upon it, retains more ſtrongly, and
works more vigorouſly then if it were
rarer.</p>
                     <p>9. And, hence, the nature of <hi>intenſion</hi>
and <hi>remiſsion</hi> is evident; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe
there are, within the ſame ſpace, more
or fewer of theſe particles: as alſo, why,
in a denſer body, a quality is more inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

                     <p>1. 'TIs conſequentiall to what has been
ſaid, that Water, ſtir'd and alter'd,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115975:49"/>
by any violence, from its planeſſe and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidiſtance
from the Centre, will not ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ceaſe its motion and return to reſt,
though that extrinſecall force be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn:
For, ſince, by that violence, ſome
of its parts are rais'd higher then they
ſhould be; 'tis manifeſt, that thoſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
parts, by the courſe of common cauſes,
muſt preſſe towards the Centre, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
thruſt others out of their place:
wherefore, the motion will continue, 'till
every one be reſtor'd to its own proper
place.</p>
                     <p>2. And, becauſe ther's no motion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>concitation</hi> and a certain degree of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity;
therefore, by the very ſtop of the
motion, a new motion will be occaſion'd,
but weaker and weaker ſtill, till it quite
faint away.</p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis plain, too, that the very ſame
muſt, of neceſſity, happen in Aire, if its
parts be either condens'd, or ſtir'd out of
their right place.</p>
                     <p>4. Again, it appears that, if it be thus
with the Aire, the ſame muſt be expected,
too, of any weighty moveable that's car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd
in the Aire: For, ſince the reaſon,
why ſuch deſcend not perpendicularly, is,
becauſe the progreſſive motion or the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115975:49"/>
cauſes of it are ſtronger then the cauſes of
deſcent, at leaſt in part; and, ſince the
moveable has, of it ſelf, no inclination
this or that way; it muſt needs follow the
motion of the Aire that's next it. But,
ſince a denſe thing mov'd is carri'd more
forceably, then a rare body in which it is;
the rare body it ſelf, as it gives a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to that's motion, ſo, again, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv's
an advance from that: whence it
comes to paſſe, that both the Aire and the
moveable continue their motion longer
then the Aire alone would.</p>
                     <p>5. Hence, again, it appears, that Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables
(in all other reſpects alike) the den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
they are, the longer they retain their
Motion.</p>
                     <p>6. 'Tis plain, therefore, why <hi>Pendents</hi>
by a thrid faſtned above wave up and
down, if they be rais'd from the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and then let drop: for, with their
firſt deſcent, they move the Aire, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it when it aſcends and returning with
it when it returns, but with a new and a
weaker impulſe: and ſo proceed ſtill, till
they can ſtir it no longer.</p>
                     <p>7. It appears likewiſe, that, if a Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
be violently ſtruck againſt a hard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſter:
becauſe the Aire before it muſt, of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115975:50"/>
neceſſity, yield, and that which follows it
puſhes it on; it will follow the Aire before
it, that is, 'twill be reflected from the hard
Reſiſter.</p>
                     <p>8. And this, making equall Angles, at
leaſt without any ſenſible difference: for
ſince an oblique motion is reſolv'd into
two perpendiculars, which are in a certain
proportion, by vertue of the moving cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and the Angle is caus'd and emerges
out of this proportion; it muſt needs be
that, this proportion remaining, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
of the reſult or reflection muſt needs
be the ſame with that of the impulſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence:
as in <hi>light,</hi> where the reflection
diminiſhes not <hi>ſenſibly</hi> the force; but,
where the reflection notably weakens the
force, the angle of reflection will be <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably</hi>
leſſen'd.</p>
                     <p>9. But, if the Reſiſter do but <hi>partly</hi> reſiſt
and <hi>partly</hi> admit, that which is obliquely
mov'd will be <hi>refracted</hi> (as they call it)
from the reſiſtance towards the contrary
part; that is, at the entring, towards the
Perpendicular falling from the mover up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Superficies; at the going out, from
the Perpendicular; as experience, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to reaſon, witneſſes.</p>
                     <p>10. You'l object, that <hi>Refraction</hi> of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115975:50"/>
light and denſe bodies is very different. I
anſwer, all the Experiments I have ever
heard of, conclude no ſuch thing.</p>
                     <p>11. The cauſe of <hi>Reſtitution</hi> is, that
thoſe bodies which recover themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
are chang'd from length to breadth:
but, 'tis known, an extrinſecall <hi>ſuperficies,</hi>
the more equall dimenſions it has, the
greater Quantity 'tis capable of; whence,
the more the longitude exceeds the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
ſo much the more the parts of the
impriſon'd body are compreſs'd, whoſe
motion is ſo much the ſwifter as they are
the more ſpirituous, and ſo much the
eaſilyer, too, they are dilated and rarifi'd
after they have been compreſs'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens'd
by the circumſtant cauſes: and
this is that we call <hi>Reſtitution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. But, it ordinarily happens that, if
they ſtand too long in <hi>bent,</hi> they recover
not themſelves again afterwards: becauſe,
either the condens'd parts are rarifi'd, by
the expulſion of ſome of them; or elſe
time has begot ſome ſtiffneſſe, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of the parts preſs'd together, ſo
that now 'tis not ſo eaſy for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their former habit.</p>
                     <p>13. This doctrine is evident, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſight in Fleſh; which, being preſs'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115975:51"/>
white, the Bloud retiring; but
when that returnes, it comes to it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and recovers its colour. But <hi>Steel,</hi>
above all things, moſt ſwiftly reſtores it
ſelf, becauſe it has a many extremely <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>

deduc'd, that, ſince there's
a perpetuall iſſue and ſally of ſome parts,
out of bodies abounding with intenſe
heat; and, thereupon, a certain <hi>Orbe of
Steams:</hi> other little bodies muſt, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
flow in, after the ſame manner, to the

be the ſame <hi>tumult</hi> about every ſuch body;
<hi>Leſ.</hi> 9. 2. as we ſpake of about the Earth.</p>
                     <p>2. Hence, we ſee that hot bodies natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<hi>attract</hi> thoſe things which are in the
Aire about them: Thus, we believe hot
Loafs, Onions, Apples, Dogs and Cats
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> draw infection to them, that
is, the peſtilent vapours which fly in the

                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:115975:51"/>
3. But, ſeeing that <hi>Emanations</hi> ſtrike
the Aire with a certain kind of agitation;
thoſe things will be eaſilyeſt mov'd with
this agitation and brought to the body,
which are moſt ſollicited by this ſtroak,
that is, thoſe which are moſt <hi>conformable</hi> to
the particles that ſally out.</p>
                     <p>4. To which may be added, that ſuch
parts, too, will ſtick faſter and eaſier; and,
when they are united, foment the naturall
heat of the body; which cauſes this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Thence, we ſee that <hi>Poyſons</hi> are more
eaſily ſuck'd out of infected bodies, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dry'd poyſ'nous things; but, beſt of
all, by thoſe very bodies to whom the
Poyſon to be ſuck'd out is proper.</p>
                     <p>5. But, when the parts returning are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
way viſcous, little light heterogeniall
bodies ſtick to them, too, by reaſon of
their gluyneſs, and return with them; as
may be ſeen in <hi>Electricall</hi> bodies, which lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſtraws and duſt fly to: And ſometimes
they rebound again, with a kind of <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
or vehemency; whence appears, that
the <hi>Steams</hi> of ſuch like bodies are very <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited,</hi>
and ſtart out with certain <hi>impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. Out of theſe things, it appears, that
there is, in a manner, a double nature of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115975:52"/>
every mix'd body; one, as it were, perfect
and fit to be evaporated; another, as it
were, imperfect and wanting more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction;
which two muſt, of neceſſity,
be oppos'd to one another, by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of more and leſſe.</p>
                     <p>7. Now, if we ſuppoſe a body ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
in its own Nature, as to be plac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two <hi>fountains,</hi> as it were, of ſuch
<hi>Steams;</hi> it muſt, of neceſſity, attain ſuch
a diſpoſition, that, on one ſide, 'twill be
apt to receive the one's Emanations, on
the other, the other's, and to eject them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
by the contrary ſides.</p>
                     <p>8. It will, therefore, have contrary ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
in its extremities; but, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
an indifferency, at leaſt, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to the Ends.</p>
                     <p>9. Again, its Emanations will be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
(againſt the courſe of other bodies,
which return to their own fountains) ſtill
directly on towards their <hi>oppoſite</hi> fountain:
and the body, too, if it hang ſo freely that
it may more eaſily follow its Emanations
then leave them, will it ſelf be carry'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with its Emanations.</p>
                     <p>10. But, if it cannot bear them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and yet be plac'd <hi>obliquely</hi> to the
fountain, and at liberty to turn it ſelf;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115975:52"/>
with the ſame force 'twill turn it ſelf to
the fountain.</p>
                     <p>11. Moreover, as the fountain acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and ſuffers and acts thus from the Earth

Plants.</head>
                     <p>1. 'TIs evident, again, that a Plant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expos'd to the Sun and wind,
becomes harder and dryer, at leaſt, as to
its exteriour parts: whence, it comes to
paſſe, that the Moiſture drawn up out of
the root, either by the power of the Sun or
its own naturall heat, more and gentlyer
irrigates and waters its inward parts.</p>
                     <p>2. Whence proceeds, commonly, a
threefold difference in the ſubſtance of a
Plant: for, the outermoſt part is hard
and call'd the Bark; the innermoſt is ſoft,
as being that which is laſt dry'd, and is
call'd the Marrow or Pith; laſtly, the
middle is the very ſubſtance of the Plant.</p>
                     <p>3. But, when Moiſture flows in greater
abundance out of the root, then can
be rais'd up perpendicularly, which is
the hardeſt courſe of all; it breaks out
at the ſides, ſplitting the bark of the Plant,
and makes it ſelf a kind of new trunk of
the ſame nature with the former, which we
call a <hi>Bough,</hi> or <hi>Branch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:115975:54"/>
4. But, ſince the Plant receiv's a heat'
variouſly temper'd with moiſture, by the
Sun: 'tis plain, when the moiſture is beſt
digeſted, it muſt neceſſarily break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
certain Buttons or Nuts; which are
concocted by degrees and, from their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
hardneſſe, grow ſofter by the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in of more ſubtile moiſture, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
in another degree, the ſame diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
which are in the Stock, to wit, a
Skin, Fleſh, as it were, and Marrow.</p>
                     <p>5. Only, becauſe ſome parts of the
juyce are too earthy and, therefore, grow
hard; theſe commonly coagulate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Fleſh and the Marrow, the Sun
drawing out their moiſture to the exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
parts.</p>
                     <p>6. Theſe Buttons, being found in the
more perfect Plants, uſe to be call'd <hi>Fruits;</hi>
and that which has the place of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
in them is the <hi>Seed</hi> of the Tree.</p>
                     <p>7. It appears, again, that, ſince the
temperaments of heat and moiſture are
varied without end; there muſt be, too,
infinite other things, as it were, acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
to Plants, beſides what we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                     <p>8. Whence, we ſee upon ſome Berries,
upon others Thorns, upon ſome Ioynts,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115975:55"/>
upon others other things growing; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the divers natures of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
that concurre to the breeding
them.</p>
                     <p>9. Leafs are, univerſally, common to
almoſt all; and are nothing but little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
ſprigs, the diſtances between which
are fill'd up &amp; diſtended with the ſame-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
moiſture: for, 'tis evident, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of wood and almoſt of every Plant
conſiſts of certain thrids, as it were, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
together; as appears plainly, in
the rending them aſunder. Moreover, if,
before they ſtick well together, a more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
moiſture flows in; it diſtends
theſe fibres, and, while the leafs are yet
ſtreightned and ſhut up, makes them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrap
one another as it were, cylindrically,
like a bark.</p>
                     <p>10. When they peep into the Aire, by
little and little, the fibres grow ſtiffe and
ſtreight and ſtretched farther out, and the
leaf unfolds it ſelf; becoming, according
to the order of the fibres, broader one
way, longer in the middle, and, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
from the middle, the figure ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
in longitude: they are ſplit, where
the fibres do not joyn together: to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
from them and the moiſture which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115975:55"/>
connects them, the leafs receive their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
                     <p>11. It appears, again, that Flowers are
a kind of leafs; but of the more ſpirited
and oyly parts: therefore, they are light,
odoriferous, and ſhort-liv'd, and, in Trees,
they are the forewarners of the Fruit.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="14" type="lesson">
                     <head>LESSON XIV.</head>
                     <head type="sub">Of the Accidents of Plants.</head>
                     <p>1. OUt of the figure of the parts, the
figure of the whole Plant is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and proportion'd. The
Trunk, which is the principall part, moſt
commonly grows up like a Cylinder, or
rather like a Cone, becauſe upwards ſtill
it grows ſmaller, and abates in latitude.</p>
                     <p>2. When it deviates from this figure,
the reaſon may be eaſily collected out of
the figure of the root or ſeed. Thoſe
which have a weak ſtock or Trunk do not
grow erect, but either run upon the
ground, or elſe are rais'd up and ſuſtain'd
by others, and get a <hi>ſpirall</hi> figure, like the
winding about a Cylinder.</p>
                     <p>3. For, the naturall motion of Plants
being upwards, by force of the heat and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115975:56"/>
ſting out of the Earth; and the Trunk,
by reaſon of its weakneſſe, not being able
to bear much: it bows towards the Earth,
and ſtrives to riſe again as much as 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
&amp; ſo imitates the figure of a ſerpent
creeping. But, if the ſtemme cling to ſome
prop that may help it upwards; it elevates
it ſelf, not directly, or in a ſtraight line,
but, as well as it can, winding round about
the ſides on't.</p>
                     <p>4. Again; becauſe we ſee ther's both a
kind of annuall and diurnall, as it were,
flux and reflux of heat from the Sun: ſome
Plants are but of a day's life; as certain
Flowers, which, the ſame day, blow and
wither.</p>
                     <p>5. Very many laſt not above a year;
and then are repair'd again, either by ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their ſeed, or by the reviving of their
fountain, the root; or elſe by the very
temperature of the ſoil. Others of a more
conſtant ſubſtance, do not only ſuſtain
themſelves, but increaſe for many years.
Others, again, even out-laſt Ages.</p>
                     <p>6. All have the ſame reaſon of their
life and death: their life and increaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in a due proportion of moiſture with
heat; where this fails, they faint and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:115975:56"/>
7. A Plant dies, either becauſe the Sun,
ſucking the moiſture out of the upper
parts of the Earth, has not left wherewith
to moiſten the root: or, becauſe too much
moiſture overflowing the root without a
proportionable heat, has too much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
and diffus'd the vertue of it; ſo that
the Sun ſupervening has extracted its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
radicall heat, before it could increaſe
and ſupply it ſelf:</p>
                     <p>8. Or elſe, becauſe, by little and little,
earthy and feculent parts, cleaving to the
root, have obſtructed the paſſage of the
moyſture to the inward parts of it: And
this way of death, becauſe it follows out of
the very action of life, ſeems more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to bear the denomination of old
Age and a naturall way to death.</p>
                     <p>9. Out of the ſame principles, 'tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
why ſeverall parts of the ſame Plant
produce ſuch contrary effects: For, ſince,
in the nouriſhing of the Plant there is a
kind of perpetuall ſtreining and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the parts of the Aliment, moſt of
the parts of the ſame nature muſt, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
run together to one and the ſame
place and part: Whence, the ſeverall parts
of the plant are compos'd of heterogeniall
particles of the nutritive moiſture; yet,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115975:57"/>
more or leſſe <hi>ſated,</hi> too, with the temper
and ſeaſoning imbib'd in the root: Thus,
therefore, 'tis conſonant to reaſon, that a
Plant ſhould be compos'd of contraries
and things that have contrary vertues.</p>
                     <p>10. The ſame way we come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Antipathy</hi> which is
found in divers Plants: for, ſince 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that every <hi>Plant,</hi> to its meaſure, has a
certain Orbe of vapours always encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
it, (as is evident, in ſome, by the
fmell iſſuing from them,) and ſome Plants
muſt needs conſiſt of contrary natures; if
the weaker happen to be planted within
the Sphear of the ſtronger, that corrupts
and kills it with the ſtroaks of its vapours
which beſiege it; but, if the ſtronger be
of a nature that is a friend to it, by the
ſame ſtroaks it grows more lively and
fruitfuller.</p>

of Animals.</head>
                     <p>1. ANd becauſe, the more fervent the
heat is and the moiſture more fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurable,
(that is, in a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115975:57"/>
neither reſiſting diviſion, and yet
eaſily conſiſtent) the Plant is divided into
ſo many the more members and joynts:
'tis evident, if there be ſo much heat as to
exhale fumes out of the moiſture, and
make it actually fluid, the little branches,
through which it flows and wherein 'tis
contain'd, will of neceſſity become hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
And ſince, by force of the heat, the
Moiſture is refin'd into watry and oyly
parts, the earthy remaining ſtill below: it
comes to paſſe that there are found three,
as it were, ſeverall, but ſubordinate, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of Moiſture in the ſame Plant; and,
from every one of theſe their branches,
and, in them, their own proper Moiſtures
are deriv'd.</p>
                     <p>2. Among which, thoſe that ſavour of
Water are the more remote, and more fit
to form the exteriour parts of the Plant;
and the enclosed humour is more apt for
thoſe effects which are perform'd by rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and condenſation.</p>
                     <p>3. Thoſe which ſavour of Oyle are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for Augmentation; as being of a kind
of middle nature, and conformable to all
the parts. Laſtly, the Earthy, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the whole Plant in a due tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament,
by the mixture of heat; which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115975:58"/>
the more ſolid parts are more ſuſceptible
of and longer hold.</p>
                     <p>4. Again, becauſe the watry parts are
very thin and, as it were, in a middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Water and Aire, in thoſe long and
narrow channells; 'tis clear that they are
both extremely paſſive of every impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from without, and tranſmit it to their
fountain or head.</p>
                     <p>5. And, becauſe their head has a conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with the principall fountain; for the
moſt part, the ſame paſſion will paſſe on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to that: in which, the heat being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
acute and ſpritely, and, conſequently,
capable of ſudden motion; a change in
the Plant, proportionable to its nature,
will neceſſarily follow the impreſſion made
upon it.</p>
                     <p>6. This Plant, therefore, will have theſe
two qualities: to be ſtir'd up, as it were,
and irritated with all occurrences from
without; and this very principle or head
thus irritated, will have power to move a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part of the Plant out of its preſent ſite
into another, according to the manner
and meaſure of the irritation.</p>
                     <p>7. Which two, making up that whereby
we diſtinguiſh living Creatures from ſuch
as have no life, namely this, that, upon all
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115975:58"/>
occurrences from without, they can move
themſelves; 'tis evident, that the name
of an <hi>Animal</hi> or living Creature agrees to
this Plant: We have, therefore, an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
conſiſting of three principles, a Heart,
a Liver and Brain; watred with three ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
of the Vitall and Animal ſpirits and
the Bloud; by the three various Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
of the Arteries, Veins and Nerves.</p>
                     <p>8. But, becauſe all things are increas'd
by the ſame things whereof they are made;
and all mix'd bodies are compos'd of the
Elements; 'tis clear, that Animals may be
increas'd by all bodies, ſo that they be
furniſht with fit inſtruments to make the
neceſſary tranſmutations.</p>
                     <p>9. But, ſome bodies are of a harder
tranſmutation, others of an eaſier: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
bodies ought to be choſen fit for the
food of the Animal; and thoſe that are
choſen ſhould again be reſolv'd into
parts, that the beſt may be taken and the
worſe rejected; and this, as oft as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
that is, till ſuch are choſen as, by
mere concoction and mixing with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the Animal, may be reduc'd into
a ſubſtance like it. Now, whilſt the fibres
are diſtended with this moiſture, both
they are ſtrengthned by it and the ſpaces
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115975:59"/>
between them are fill'd up: and, thus, the
Animal becomes <hi>bigger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. And, becauſe this is brought about
by concoction; thoſe bodies which have
not yet arriv'd to the degree of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
muſt needs be the moſt connaturall

                     <p>1. AGain, becauſe the Heart has heat
and moiſture in it, and moiſture
boyls with heat, and is turn'd
into fumes; 'tis manifeſt, the ſame moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
does not remain conſtantly in the

with other moiſture flowing into it.</p>
                     <p>2. There is, therefore, a continuall
flux of moiſture through the heart; which,
heated in it and then caſt out to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd

3. Out of what has been ſaid, may be
underſtood, what a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> and the <hi>Cure</hi> of
it is: for, when any part is indiſpos'd, ſo
that unwholeſome vapours fume out of
it, they, mix'd with the bloud, overrun
and diſcompoſe, as much as they can, the
whole body and the very Heart it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>4. And, according as theſe vapours do
more frequently riſe to ſuch a bulk, that
they are able vehemently to aſſail the
whole Animal; ſo much the frequenter
are the <hi>Fits</hi> of the Diſeaſe. And thus, ſome
are continuall, and others have intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
ſome every other day, ſome tertians,
ſome quotidians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. And the true nature and Method of
Curing is, To ſeek out the part origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
ill-affected, and apply remedies to
that.</p>
                     <p>6. Thus, too, it appears, how Phyſick
expells one certain <hi>determinate</hi> humour
out of the whole body: for a Drug, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
being concocted in the Ventricle, which
has a power of diſſolving and rendring
fluid a certain humour of the body, its
vertue is diffus'd through all the Veins by
the fore-explicated Motion of the Heart;
whence, it comes to paſſe that, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
to ſtool, <hi>that</hi> humour rather and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115975:60"/>
more then any others follows out of all
the members; or, if the Phyſick be dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticall,
that will ſweat out more then
any of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>7. Laſtly, 'tis clear, ſince an Animal is a
Plant; by the higheſt concoction, a <hi>Seed</hi>
or <hi>compendium</hi> of its nature may be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in it as well as in Plants: which, duly
ejected into a congruous ambient body,
may ſpring up into a new Animal.</p>
                     <p>8. Now, this ſeed coagulates firſt into
a Heart, then into a Brain, and at length
into a Liver: out of every one of which
their own proper little Channels ſpring;
as is obſerv'd by thoſe that pry artificially
into theſe things.</p>

                     <p>1. OUt of what has been ſaid, it may
evidently be concluded that,
ſince the Heart is mov'd natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and, by its motion, preſſes out a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
humour, which they uſe to call the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> into the Channels connected with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115975:60"/>
it ſelf and into the bodies joyn'd to it:
and the Fleſh is fibrous, <hi>viz.</hi> certain parts
conſtipated together of a world of minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
fibres ſticking to one another: and
ſince, if a connaturall moiſture, eſpecially
being warm, get into ſuch a body, it makes
it ſwell and, of thin, become thicker, of
long, ſhorter: It comes to paſſe that the
Members, whether conſiſting of ſuch fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres
or knit together by them, attain ſome
kind of <hi>locall Motion,</hi> by that irrigation
from the Heart.</p>
                     <p>2. Again, the Channels, eſpecially if
they are extremely little, will ſwell, too,
and become ſhorter.</p>
                     <p>3. Since, therefore, 'tis apparent, that
there flow abundance of Spirits from the
Heart to the Brain; and again, that, from
the Brain through the whole body, moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubtilly-hollow
nerves are extended to all
the members, and loſe themſelves by their
diſperſion, as it were, in the Muſcles: 'Tis
plain, the Muſcles will ſwell with theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
as oft as the Heart overflows; and
conſequently, become ſhorter, and the
parts adhering to them be drawn back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to the head of the Muſcles; and,
which clearly follows, all the extremities
of the body be mov'd, from the motion of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115975:61"/>
the Heart, according to what is convenient
to its nature.</p>
                     <p>4. It follows, too, how certain other
members, which have no Nerves but only
fibres, have motions of their <hi>own;</hi> which
conſiſt almoſt in nothing elſe but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
and dilatation: For, the fibres
being made ſhorter by their irrigation,
they draw the body with them into that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
which follows out of their contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which, when the fibres are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd,
is dilatation, when other ways ſet,
contraction.</p>
                     <p>5. Again, hence appears how the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive
motion of an Animal is effected:
For, an Animal which is mov'd by walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whilſt it ſtands ſtill, has the Centre of
its gravity ſet directly to the Centre; but,
when it ſets a foot any way, it inclines the
centre of its gravity, and conſequently its
whole body, that way; till, transferring
the other foot, it ſets it down too: and
this often repeated is <hi>walking.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. But, one that <hi>leaps,</hi> when he has contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the ſuperiour or fore-parts to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
or hinder-parts; ſuddenly pouring
out ſpirits through convenient Nerves, he
thruſts the fore-parts forwards, with ſuch
a force that the hinder-parts follow them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:115975:61"/>
7. Something like this is the <hi>creeping</hi> of
feetleſſe Creatures: for, fixing their breaſt
or ſome other part, they bow their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone
or that which ſerv's in ſtead of it, and
ſo draw the hinder to the fore-parts; then,
fixing ſome of their hinder-parts to the
Earth, they advance their fore-parts, by
ſtraightning again their back.</p>
                     <p>8. <hi>Swimming</hi> is made out of leaping:
for, it being effected by the Inſtrument's
firſt being crook'ned and then ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
again; by the reſiſting Water the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is puſht forward: and, the ſame hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
in flying.</p>
                     <p>9. Now, the body being heavier then
the <hi>Medium</hi> in a certain proportion, and
conſequently, obliged to ſpend <hi>a certain</hi>
time in deſcending; and the adventitious
Motion making the <hi>Medium</hi> ſtrain with
more <hi>vehemence</hi> againſt that motion of the

                     <head type="sub">Of the five ſenſes of Animals.</head>
                     <p>1. OUt of what has been ſaid, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that there are certain
Channels ſpread through the
whole body of an Animal, full of a kind of
aiery humour; and that they are long and
narrow: whence, the leaſt impreſſion made
in any extremity of the body muſt needs,
in a moment, run to their fountain, the
Brain; and, thence deſcend to the Heart.
Theſe channels, therefore, being any way
obſtructed, the Animal is ſenſible of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without.</p>
                     <p>2. And, ſince bodies that make impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
either do it by their immediate
ſelves, or elſe by the mediation of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
body; and, thoſe that act by their
immediate ſelves, either do it in their
proper bulk, or broken into parts, or by
naturall emiſſions; and thoſe bodies, by
the mediation whereof univerſally one
body acts upon another, are either Aire,
or Fire, or light which we ſee every body
bandies againſt another: It follows, that
an Animal, if it be perfect, may be affected
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115975:62"/>
theſe five ways by the things about it.</p>
                     <p>3. And, becauſe 'tis evident that theſe
five ways are diſtinct; the Animal, too, it
ſelf will have five diſtinct diſpoſitions, by
which it will be apt to receive theſe five
impreſſions; to chuſe the things that are
congruous and refuſe thoſe that are noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
both in its food and other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to its conſervation.</p>
                     <p>4. Again, becauſe theſe impreſſions are
different; 'tis fit the <hi>Organs</hi> that are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them be plac'd in ſeverall parts of
the Animal: Animals, therefore, have <hi>five</hi>
Senſes.</p>
                     <p>5. 'Tis apparent, too, that the <hi>Senſes</hi>
are nothing but certain different degrees
of <hi>Touches:</hi> For, the parts of the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
muſt needs make only a more ſubtile
ſtroak, of the ſame nature with the ſtroak
of the whole.</p>
                     <p>6. And, hence, we diſtinguiſh the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of <hi>Taſts;</hi> ſo, as, that one pricks,
another cutt's, another bruſhes, another
ſmooth's: the differences of <hi>Smels,</hi> too,
are a-kin to Taſts.</p>
                     <p>7. But, the differences of <hi>Sounds</hi> are
the ſame with thoſe of Motions; diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht
by ſwiftneſſe and ſlowneſſe, by big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſmalneſſe, Laſtly, 'tis evident,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115975:63"/>
that Fire or Light make ſtroaks too, by
its Activity upon other bodies.</p>
                     <p>8. It appears, farther, of what nature
the Senſes muſt be, and where ſituated.
For, the Touch, being to receive the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of thoſe qualities whereof the body
of the Animal conſiſts, requires nothing
but a middling kind of Moiſture, or the
naturall quality of that vapour which fills
the Channels; and therefore, like them,
'tis diffus'd through the whole body.</p>
                     <p>9. The <hi>Taſt,</hi> becauſe it requires a Moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
which may diſſolve the minuteſt
parts, needs an abundance of Moiſture,
and a ſite where the food may be diſſected.
The <hi>Smell,</hi> by which Aire chiefly enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the body, requires a ſite and Organ
where the vapours may ſtick, that, being
conſtipated together, they may act the
more powerfully.</p>
                     <p>10. The <hi>Hearing</hi> and <hi>Sight</hi> require a
ſituation near the Brain; in an eminent
place, where Motion and Light may come
to them more pure; and Organs, which
may multiply Light by refraction and
Motion by reflection.</p>
                     <p>11. Nor is it leſſe evident, that the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi>
is perfected in that part of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
where chiefly reſides that vertue for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115975:63"/>
which the Senſe was made; that is, to
transferre to the Brain the action of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
without: If the <hi>black</hi> of the Eye, the
<hi>hammer</hi> of the Eare, the <hi>pulp</hi> of the Noſe
doe this; the Senſation alſo muſt be plac'd
in them.</p>
                     <p>12. It appears, too, why the Senſes are
believ'd to conſiſt in a kind of <hi>Spirituality</hi>
and <hi>abstraction</hi> from matter: For, ſince
they are ordain'd by nature, only that the
Animal may be mov'd; the ſtroak of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
things is ſo thin and ſubtile, that it
changes not the quality of the Organ ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly,
and, therefore, 'tis not believ'd to be
materiall.</p>
                     <p>13. And, hence, too, the <hi>Senſible object</hi>
is commonly believ'd to be in the Senſe,
not as ſomething of the ſame nature or
contrary to it, but purely as <hi>another thing;</hi>
by which miſtake, Senſation is thought to
be a kind of knowledge.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Objects of the Senſes.</head>
                     <p>1. LAſtly, it appears, wherein conſiſts
the being Objects of Senſe: for,
Touchable things, 'tis plain, are
the firſt Qualities, or thoſe which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115975:64"/>
deriv'd from them: Taſtable
things, conformable to nature, are Sweets;
and muſt neceſſarily conſiſt, as the nature
it ſelf does, in a moderate heat and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
or, of the degree proper to the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</p>
                     <p>2. From this temper, other Savours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
too much, towards cold and heat, or
moiſture and dryneſſe: as ſalt, ſharp and
bitter things taſt too much of heat; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent,
crabbed, of cold; ſour, bitter
and ſharp, of dryneſſe; inſipid, of moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.
Proportion'd to this is the account
of Smells.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Sounding</hi> things are dry and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
which are eaſily wav'd up and down:
but, ſoft things hinder Sound.</p>
                     <p>4. Since <hi>Colours</hi> ſtrike the Eye, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
muſt conſiſt in a vertue to reflect
Light; that is, in a denſity &amp; conſtipation
of parts, and in having a many-corner'd fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure:
And theſe commonly favour of
cold and dryneſſe; and their oppoſites,
of moiſture and heat.</p>
                     <p>5. Laſtly, <hi>Light</hi> it ſelf (and dilated
flame, if wee'l ſuppoſe it repell'd from the
Object to the Eyes, muſt neceſſarily doe
the ſame as Light) will repreſent the figure
of a thing by interſhadow'd ſtroaks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the Organ, and ſtrike, more or leſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature of that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
it: if it paſſe through a triangular

the ſame varieties, that is, differences of
<hi>Colours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. But, that light, too, does thoſe
things which are proper to fire, <hi>(viz.</hi> to
dry, to burn, to be reflected, refracted,
collected, diſpers'd, produced and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht,)
is ſo clear, that it cannot be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but light is fire.</p>
                     <p>7. Nor imports it againſt this, That
it ſeems to be mov'd in an inſtant, That it
fills the whole Aire, That it penetrates ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
bodies, as <hi>glaſse, &amp;c.</hi> for, theſe things
<hi>ſeem</hi> ſo only, through the defect of our

                     <head type="sub">Of Knovvledge and Memory.</head>
                     <p>1. FArther, it appears, that theſe Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when they ſtrike againſt the
deſtin'd part of the Brain, in which
knowledge is produc'd; though it be fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and clammy, according to the nature
of the Brain, yet are they repell'd from it,
becauſe frequent new impulſes charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſame point.</p>
                     <p>2. Thoſe little bodies, therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
thence, carrying away with them
ſome little particle of the Brain which
ſticks to them; and wander up and down
in the ventricles of the brain, till they reſt
upon the bottome or ſtick to the ſides.</p>
                     <p>3. Whence, being rub'd off, as it were
with a bruſh, by the motion of the Spirits,
when there's occaſion; they ſwimme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and are brought back to that part
which is the fountain of knowledge.</p>
                     <p>4. The firſt ſtroak produces <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi>
the later, actuall <hi>Memory;</hi> which,
if it be made by deſign, is call'd <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. Again; ſince Motion requires that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115975:65"/>
the Nerves be well fill'd with Spirits, and
that the extrinſecall parts be ſtrong; but
Senſation needs only a clam and clear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the Humour contain'd in thoſe
<hi>Nerves:</hi> 'tis plain, both that there may be
Senſation without Motion, and Motion
without Senſation.</p>
                     <p>6. It appears, too, why the Memory is
ſet a work by the <hi>Similitude,</hi> as alſo by the
<hi>connection</hi> of Objects: For, ſince, in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
body, things that are alike naturally
gather together, and are apt to ſtick to
one another; and, ſince thoſe things
which enter together and at once muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
attain a kind of connection,
which is eaſily preſerv'd in the clammy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Brain; when, by any means,
they are brought again to the fountain of
ſenſation, they muſt needs meet there <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi>
and in a kind of <hi>Order.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. But, ſince <hi>contraries</hi> uſe to enter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
into the internall ſenſe, and make
one another more taken notice of; 'tis
plain, if Hunger provokes the Animal, 'twill
remember Meat, if Thirſt, Drink, if Seed,
the Female. Whence, it appears, that <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
and <hi>Will</hi> ſtir up the <hi>Memory:</hi> as alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cauſes, too, which, by pouring in
ſpirits, ſweep or bruſh, as it were, the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115975:66"/>
Brain; and for that theſe cauſes do this
by accident, they are all comprehended
under the name of <hi>Chance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. It appears, again, that they, whoſe
brain is of a thin and hot conſtitution, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<hi>apprehend, conjecture</hi> happily, <hi>opine</hi> raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and changeably: they, whoſe diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is more dry and thin, have a good <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi>
and <hi>rememberance</hi> too, but <hi>opine</hi> light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and changeably.</p>
                     <p>9. They that have a temperate Brain,
have the beſt <hi>judgement:</hi> ſince, they look
upon many things, before they eſtabliſh
their Opinion; and, for the ſame reaſon,
they are not changeable.</p>
                     <p>10. Laſtly, ſince, by the ſtroaks of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
ſome litle particle is ſtill taken off
and carry'd away from the brain: when
the ſame returns again, it muſt needs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that we <hi>have been</hi> ſenſible of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                     <p>1. IT appears farther, that, ſince the
Nerves muſt needs be diſtant from
that part of the brain wherein Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
is produc'd; it may fall out, that,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115975:66"/>
the motion by the Nerves being obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
there may yet a Motion proceed,
from ſome part of the brain to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part: and then, ſome things will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to the Animal to be, as if it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
them by its Senſes, when yet it did
not receive them.</p>
                     <p>2. This ſtopping of the Senſes is called
<hi>Sleep;</hi> and ſuch apparitions, <hi>Dreams:</hi> An
Animal, therefore, will ſleep and dream
ſometimes.</p>
                     <p>3. But, becauſe there's no neceſſity, that
all the Senſes or Nerves muſt be ſtop'd at
once; 'twill happen, that an Animal may
partly ſleep and partly wake: Whence, it
comes to paſſe that, the Nerves of the
Tongue being left unſtop'd, ſome talk in
their Dreams; and, if the Nerves for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
too, be unſtop'd, that they anſwer to
thoſe that ſpeak to them; or, if there be
no obſtruction towards the Marrow in the
Back-bone, they walk, too, and uſe their
hands.</p>
                     <p>4. When, therefore, ſome of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are at liberty, Dreams may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
by them: another way, by ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
diſpoſition, which affects the heart,
and makes a motion in the brain confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to that impreſſion: or, laſtly, by
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115975:67"/>
much precedent thinking, objects may be
ſtirr'd up and down, too, in ones Sleep.</p>
                     <p>5. But, a Man being in a manner quiet
in his Sleep, he happens ſometimes to
judge more truly of things he ſees, in his
ſleep, then when awake: For the Soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturb'd,
of its own nature, more clearly
perceiv's the force of the Objects playing
up and down before it, to diſcover Truth;
and unperceiv'dly orders them: Hence,
it comes to paſſe, that, ſometimes, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
in our Sleep, <hi>future</hi> or <hi>abſent</hi> things,
which we could not find out nor pierce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
by conſideration, or diſcourſe, when
we were awake.</p>
                     <p>6. And, the ſame may be the caſe of
<hi>Fools, Mad</hi> and <hi>Melancholy</hi> perſons; though
'tis very rare and to be eſteem'd prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and they have a great many falſities

them.</head>
                     <p>1. FArther, 'tis deducible, that, ſince
impreſſions made in the Brain are
convey'd, by a ſhort and open
way, to the Heart; they muſt, neceſſarily
have an effect, too, in the Heart, conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the natures of both.</p>
                     <p>2. Since, therefore, the heart redounds
with hot ſpirits: as we ſee a little drop of
red wine, dropd into water, diffuſes it ſelf
into the water and changes it, according
to its nature; ſo, the impreſſion of theſe
little bodies will have the like effect upon
the fumes of the heart.</p>
                     <p>3. Hence, again, it proceeds, that the
motion of the heart, through theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
ſometimes freer and better, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
worſe; and that theſe very quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
paſſe into the Pulſe, whence, according
to the variety of <hi>Paſsions,</hi> the Pulſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                     <p>4. Again, Paſſions muſt needs differ by
dilatation and conſtriction: for, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115975:68"/>
Object, the Spirits of the heart
are made more rare, whence, the heart
more freely enjoys its motion; by things
diſagreeable to Nature, the Spirits become
more craſſe and heavy, and the heart is, as
it were, oppreſs'd.</p>
                     <p>5. Again; ſince an abſent Object does
not equally affect, with a preſent one;
theſe motions will be more remiſſe in its
abſence then in its preſence: whence, we
deduce four differences of Paſſions; <hi>Ioy</hi>
and <hi>Grief,</hi> for a <hi>preſent</hi> good or evil; <hi>Hope</hi>
and <hi>Fear,</hi> for them <hi>abſent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Anger</hi> is, in a manner, mixt of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
evil and future good: and, 'tis the
moſt violent of all the Paſſions; becauſe,
ſo mething that's contrary to it falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an abundance of hot bloud, produces
a moſt ſwift effect; juſt as when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
moiſt and cold falls into molten
Metall.</p>
                     <p>7. Again, becauſe the Spirits, flowing
at that time out of the heart to the brain,
retain that nature they had receiv'd in the
heart; in the brain it ſelf they gather to
them thoſe <hi>Phantaſms</hi> that are conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to them: whence, the Animal muſt, of
neceſſity, be much fixt upon that thought,
and not eaſily admit any other then
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115975:68"/>
ſuch as are conformable to its Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>8. And, becauſe the heart is joyn'd to
the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> and the Pericardium to
the <hi>Diaphragm;</hi> and the Diaphragm is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
with an eminent Nerve, and is movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
within it ſelf: it comes to paſſe, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
motion of the heart flow's, by the
Diaphragm, into the neighbouring parts
of the body, and all the motions of them
all return again, by its Nerve, to the brain;
and, ſo, beget a ſenſe of that grief or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
which the heart is affected with.
Whence, too, without any externall Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
but by <hi>thinking</hi> only, an Animal
may be delighted and incourag'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>9. Again, becauſe, by repeating either
the ſtroaks of Objects or very Thoughts,
there grows a great multitude of <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms</hi>
of the ſame thing, in the brain; and,
in like manner, the heart often agitated
by ſuch like cauſes in a certain motion,
gets an aptitude to be eaſily mov'd <hi>ſo:</hi>
there grows, both in the <hi>brain</hi> and in the
heart, a certain conſtancy and facility of
knowing and doing; in which conſiſts the
notion of <hi>Intellectuall</hi> and <hi>Morall habits,</hi>
as far as they are grounded in the body.</p>
                     <p>10. Laſtly, ſince, by the motion of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115975:69"/>
Diaphragm, the breathing is alter'd; and
breathing, expreſs'd out of a hollow place
through a narrow paſſage, is apt to yield a
<hi>Voice,</hi> by reaſon of the multiplication of
its proceſſions, occaſion'd by the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the cavity: it comes to paſſe, that
the Voice of Animals is altered by the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of their Paſſions; and ſo, in grief, they
expreſſe one Voice, another in hope, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in joy.</p>

others.</head>
                     <p>1. FArther, it appears, that, ſince, all
<hi>Senſations</hi> (whether of thoſe things
which affect the body from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
or thoſe we are ſenſible of becauſe
one part of the body affects another,) are
produc'd in a certain ſite to the Organ of
Senſation, that is, in a right or the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
line of Motion, from the Entries of
the Nerves to the place of Senſation: It
follows, that, when we think of the ſame
things, they muſt be in the very ſame ſite
and poſture; whence, it comes to paſſe,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115975:69"/>
that, in Dreams, and in Diſtraction of mind
we ſeem to ſee the very things themſelves
before us.</p>
                     <p>2. 'Tis apparent, therefore, they are in
a fit ſituation for this, viz. to be preſs'd, by
the motion made by the heart, into the
ſame Nerves: whence it follows, that, by
the <hi>thinking</hi> on any Object, the nerves are
<hi>juſt</hi> ſo mov'd as when the Senſes <hi>convey</hi> it;
and conſequently, the ſame action is apt to
follow.</p>
                     <p>3. And, thus we ſee, Laughing and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> proceed from ſeeing others
doe ſo; as love and hatred from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay.</p>
                     <p>4. Hence, it comes to paſſe, that blear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey'dneſſe
and other diſtorſions of the
Members are often deriv'd from behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others: that contagious Diſeaſes, too,
(for which ſome diſpoſition in the body
prepares the way) are attracted and, as it
were, <hi>ſuck'd in,</hi> by fear: and, that other
Diſeaſes, which the retraction of a humour
to ſome certain parts produces, are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by mere <hi>ſight</hi> or <hi>imagination</hi> only.</p>
                     <p>5. Again, becauſe the members of the
body are connected, and the exteriour
depend upon the interiour; theſe opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
cannot be produc'd, but that, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connection,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115975:70"/>
the exteriour members muſt
ſome way be chang'd: and thus, we ſee,
all the Paſſions ſhew themſelves in the
countenance and actions of Animals; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which depends the principles of <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. Again; becauſe <hi>uſuall</hi> Motions ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Organs apt for ſuch motions: it
comes to paſſe, that, in <hi>generation,</hi> the like
diſpoſitions are oft transfer'd to the iſſue,
and the Off-ſpring becomes like the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
both in its naturall operations and
thoſe which depend upon Senſation;
nay, even in ſome triviall things, too,
as in Warts, in hookedneſſe of noſe, and
the like.</p>
                     <p>7. Moreover, ſince the iſſue in the
womb derives its nouriſhment from the
Mother, 'tis no wonder if the deſires of the
Mother, at that time, paſſe into the iſſue:
as, if they long for wine or whatever other
food or pleaſure, that the iſſue ſhould
ſuck in ſuch a diſpoſition as to be obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the ſame things all their lives.</p>
                     <p>8. Again, ſince ſuch <hi>longings</hi> fix a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
reſemblance of the things in the
Fancy; and terrour, too, or any violent
paſſion does the ſame; and that <hi>image</hi> is
made by Motion: 'tis no wonder that the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115975:70"/>
                        <hi>Spirits</hi> of the Mother tremble with the
ſame motion, even as far as to the Iſſue it
ſelf; and that, as light with its ſtroak,
paints in a glaſſe the reflected Image of a
body, ſo this Image ſhould, in the little
tender body of an Infant, and where-ever
it finds matter apt to preſerve it, leave an
image fixt in the fleſh, as it were a Mark
of that deſire.</p>
                     <p>9. And, becauſe, too, the Infant is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more tender then at the firſt commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Father and Mother's Seeds,
and women, in the conjugall act, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſome, are very paſſive: 'tis no wonder,
if a violent apprehenſion of their's, in that
conjuncture, often changes the complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Iſſue; the Female <hi>Seed</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a kind of proper ſtamp, from the

                     <head type="sub">Of the ſeeming-rationall Actions of
Animals.</head>
                     <p>1. 'TIs plain, again, that Animals
muſt, of neceſſity, operate ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-reaſonably,
or like Reaſon:
For, ſince the work of nature is the work
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115975:71"/>
of <hi>THAT REASON</hi> which fram'd nature;
the effects of Nature muſt needs be the
works of the ſame Reaſon, and reſemble
the manner of Reaſon's working.</p>
                     <p>2. Again; ſome of their operations
muſt needs <hi>exceed</hi> thoſe which Reaſon
works in us: For, ſince they ſpring from
a <hi>REASON</hi> which tranſcends ours, 'tis but
conſequentiall, that they ſhould tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
the effects of our Reaſon; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in <hi>Generation,</hi> which we underſtand
not how 'tis done, even when we doe it; as
neither could a Man tell the houres of the
day as a Clock does, which yet is it ſelf
but a work of our Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>3. It appears, too, whence proceed the
<hi>Antipathies</hi> and <hi>Sympathies</hi> of Animals: viz.
partly, out of the naturall diſpoſition of
contrary qualities,<note place="margin">Leſſ. 14. n. 10.</note> as in Plants:
partly, out of an apprehenſion
of evil joyn'd with the Object;
which ſometimes takes its riſe in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and is tranſmitted to the Iſſue, out
of the diſpoſition of the Parents body.</p>
                     <p>4. Farther, the <hi>vertuous</hi> Actions of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
as thoſe of ove of Glory, Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
Generoſity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are nothing but
ſuch <hi>materiall impetuoſities;</hi> which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we feel in our ſelves joyn'd with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115975:71"/>
we, therefore, believe to be juſt ſo,
too, in Animals.</p>
                     <p>5. Laſtly, their concatenated and <hi>order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-proceeding</hi>
actions are the effects, partly,
of fore-going actions, partly, of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the circumſtant bodies; as
they may find by experience, whoever
have the leiſure to obſerve a Dunghill
Hen: The admiration of which actions
ought not to ſtop at the Animals, but at
their Maker; who has fram'd ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation,
out of which the Effect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
after ſo many Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>6. And, thus much may ſuffice about
Animals, in common. <hi>MAN</hi> three things
raiſe above the Crowd: in his Internall
Senſe, That he can <hi>order,</hi> and <hi>rummige</hi> for,
and own, &amp; uſe the Inſtruments of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
in his Tongue and Voice, That

he has <hi>Hands,</hi> an Inſtrument not fitted to
any one determinate operation, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd
to a kind of univerſality of Acting.

of all exiſtent Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
That <hi>this</hi> is not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
'tis evident: For, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
longitude be infinite, that very notion
imports that it has infinite parts equall to
one another, (paces, ſuppoſe, or feet); and
conſequently, from an aſſigned point in
that line, ſome one foot will be, by infinite
others, diſtant; and ſo a term aſſign'd,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115975:72"/>
and limits fix'd at both ends, to a line
which is call'd infinite.</p>
                     <p>2. If you anſwer, ſome one foot is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
intermediate ones diſtant from an
aſſign'd point, but that foot cannot be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd;
as ſome one horſe is neceſſary to
ride on, yet no determinate one: 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
indetermination and infinity are
qualifications or manners of a thing in <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiâ</hi>
or <hi>poſsibilitie:</hi> and ſo a horſe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determin'd
whilſt he is yet but neceſſary,
that is, in poſſibility, not in act.</p>
                     <p>3. Nor makes it againſt this, that there
are infinite objects in the underſtanding
of the <hi>Intelligences:</hi> for, admit there were,
we are not ſure they are there actually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
and not after the manner <hi>of one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. You'l ſay, Suppoſe <hi>Quantity</hi> to exiſt
as great as 'tis poſſible, and 'twill be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite:
'tis no contradiction, therefore, to
ſuppoſe it infinite. 'Tis anſwer'd, that,
ſince, ſuppoſing any Quantity, how big ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
yet one may alwaies ſuppoſe a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
there is no Quantity ſo big as <hi>may</hi>
exiſt: whence, this is an implicatory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
that is, ſuch as couches contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in it ſelf; as taking the manner of
<hi>poſsibility</hi> to be the manner of <hi>act.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. Again, 'tis evident, there's <hi>but one
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115975:73"/>
World:</hi> For, ſince there's no ſpace, by
which two worlds could be ſeparated one
from the other; and quantitative bodies
joyn'd together, even by that very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
are one; all quantity whatever
muſt, of neceſſity, by continuedneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
into one bulk.</p>
                     <p>6. Again, 'tis collected, that the <hi>World</hi>
is not compos'd only of minute bodies,
by nature <hi>indiviſible:</hi> for, ſince an extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall
denomination is nothing, but the
intrinſecall natures of the things out of
which it riſes; and, if there were only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſibles
in the world, all the intrinſecalls
would remain the ſame; ſince the ſame
things alwaies afford the ſame denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
'twould be impoſſible any thing
ſhould be chang'd.</p>
                     <p>7. And, hence it follows, that there is
ſtill ſome <hi>liquid</hi> ſubſtance, where-ever
there's any <hi>locall</hi> mutation: and therefore
in Heaven it ſelf, the Sphears cannot be ſo
contiguous that there intervenes not ſome
liquid and diviſible ſubſtance between
them.</p>
                     <p>8. Since, therefore, a <hi>whole,</hi> after 'tis
divided, is no longer what it was; every
<hi>diviſible</hi> ſubſtance, in that very reſpect, is
<hi>mortall.</hi> Wherefore, every moveable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

                     <p>1. TIs infer'd, that all <hi>Corporeall</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
whereever is corruptible;
ſince all participate the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Quantity: whoſe differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rare and denſe, and, out of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion,
the Elements and all mixt things
being deriv'd, the differences of all quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative
things, that is, bodies, muſt needs
be <hi>proportion'd</hi> to theſe we ſee amongſt us;
that is, there may be Elements or mixt
things differing, indeed, in temperament,
but the ſame and entirely agreeing in the
common notions.</p>
                     <p>2. Again, ſince the differences of mixt
things, Vegetables and Animals, both from
one another and among themſelves, are
condivided by the oppoſition of <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi>
that is, by <hi>this</hi> not being ſo much as
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115975:74"/>
                        <hi>that;</hi> as, mixt bodies are either vegetable
or not vegetable, and vegetables are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or not ſenſible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though we cannot
tell whether all our <hi>kinds</hi> may be found in
the other parts of the world; yet, certain it
is, that no other kinds can be found, which
may not be reduc'd to theſe amongſt us.</p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis objected, Since the Notion of a
body is, to be moveable; bodies, to which
a <hi>ſimple</hi> Motion is naturall, muſt be <hi>ſimple:</hi>
now, we find three ſimple motions in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
upwards, downwards and circular:
the former two of theſe oppoſe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and conſequently, both they and the
bodies, whoſe they are, deſtroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and are corruptible; circular moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
therefore, becauſe it has no oppoſite,
muſt be incorruptible, and ſo the Heavens,
too, to which this motion is proper. 'Tis
anſwer'd, ſince a body is a mover mov'd;
and to be a Mover is a nobler Notion then
to be mov'd; the differences of bodies are
rather to be deduc'd from that of being
Movers, then from this, that they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable.</p>
                     <p>4. Again, 'tis falſe, that the ſubjects of
ſimple Motions muſt be ſimple bodies:
for, both all mix'd things are carry'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and downwards, and two Elements
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115975:74"/>
are aſſign'd to either of theſe motions;
and, which is moſt conſiderable, theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
agree to theſe bodies, by accident,
not out of their naturall diſpoſition. 'Tis
falſe, too, that the third, <hi>viz.</hi> circular, is
a ſimple Motion: for, Ariſtotle himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
it to be compounded of <hi>thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting</hi>
and <hi>drawing;</hi> and 'tis manifeſtly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
on according to two perpendiculars
at once, and at leaſt four times reflected,
and has a great difformity in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its carriage: Whence, it appears,
if we were to judge from the nature of
their Motions, the Heavens muſt needs be
no ſimple but a moſt compounded bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                     <p>5. 'Tis objected, again, there would
have appear'd, in ſo long time, ſome
change in the Heavens, if they were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible.
'Tis anſwer'd, there's no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of that; as 'tis not credible that, if one
were in Heaven, he would diſcern the
Changes we ſuffer: But, again, many
things have appear'd, as more at large ſhall
be ſhew'd hereafter. Moreover, Light is
concluded to be the ſame with Fire; and
<hi>that</hi> our very Eyes witneſſe to be ſpread e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where over the viſible world: but,
where there is any one Element, there,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115975:75"/>
Ariſtotle acknowledges the reſt, too;
and indeed, with the ſame Eyes, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
an opake body reflecting the
light.</p>
                     <p>6. 'Tis objected, Animals cannot live
in the Moon; not Men, particularly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
in it, there is not a variety of Earth
and Waters, nor rains, nor clouds: Adde
to this, a moſt vehement heat; the Sun
ſhining continually upon the ſame part
for fifteen whole days together, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
receding, in <hi>latitude,</hi> above ten degrees
from the part illuminated.</p>
                     <p>7. 'Tis anſwer'd, If there be a kind of
groſſer Aire, as 'tis obſerv'd, there will, of
neceſſity, be Water: for theſe groſſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
are made out of Earth, and have the
nature of water before, though perhaps
the Clouds are not ſo big as to be taken
notice of. Beſides, the <hi>Almains</hi> have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
ſomething like a vaſt cloud in the
Moon. The extreme heat is moderated, by
the height of the Mountains, the lowneſſe
of the Vallies, the abundance of water and
woods: as we ſee by experience under the
Aequator, from which the Sun is at fartheſt
about twenty three degrees diſtant; and,
but about ten only for half the year, from
the middle between the Aequator and the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115975:75"/>
Tropick; yet this hinders not but thoſe
are moſt happy regions.</p>

                     <p>1. THe greateſt part of the world,
which we have ſome kind of
knowledge of, conſiſts of the
Sun and ſix great bodies illuminated by
it; and ſome leſſer ones, which are, in a
manner, members cut off from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>2. The bigger bodies are counted by
Aſtronomers, Saturn, Iupiter, Mars, the
Earth, Mercury, Venus: which, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
(of the reſt by evident experiments,
of Mars and Saturn by their parity to the

Sun.</p>
                     <p>3. Mercury is believ'd to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd

appears horned like the Moon. Iupiter;
<hi>ſuffers</hi> from the Stars accompanying him
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115975:76"/>
and they, reciprocally, from him. The
Sun alone ſhines of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>4. Moreover, ſince light is Fire, the
fountain of light is the fountain of Fire,
too. The SUN, therefore, is a vaſt body,
conſiſting of Mountains and Plains which
belch out fire; and, as Aetna, Lipara and
Hecla are never without flames, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
the Vulcanian Mountains of
the new world, ſo, much leſſe is the Sun.</p>

                     <p>7. And, ſince we have the ſame Actour
upon the other ſix Bodies, the effects, too,
muſt needs be analogous upon an analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous
matter, as we have already prov'd
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115975:76"/>
                        <hi>that</hi> of all other bodies muſt be: amongſt
theſe, the <hi>Earth,</hi> by which we are nouriſht,
is the beſt known to us.</p>
                     <p>8. <hi>This,</hi> our very ſenſes tell us, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into three parts: A ſolid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
which we call Earth; a liquid but
craſſe one, which we call Water; and anin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
one, which we call Aire.</p>
                     <p>9. The Earth is not a Loadſtone: firſt,
becauſe it hangs not on any other; for,
the Stars of the Eighth Sphear are at
too great a diſtance, to look for any
Magneticall action from them: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe that vertue in it which attracts
the loadſtone, is not diffus'd through
the whole body of the Earth, but reſts
only in the bark of it, as it were: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe, if it were a loadſtone, it would
joyn to ſome other body, as the load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
does to Iron; nor would it be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
about in any place or with any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its own, but proceed to joyn it
ſelf with that other. The parts of the
Earth are Mountains, Valleys, Caverns,
Plains.</p>
                     <p>10. And, ſince, we know, Fire will
make water boil and ſwell, and dilate
whatever other bodies are mixt with the
water; we ſee, too, that the Earth, both
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115975:77"/>
within in its bowells, and in its ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
is furniſht with heat to concoct Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
and juyces: as, in our bodies, when
the heat abounds with moiſture above
the juſt proportion in any part, it breeds
warts and wens and bliſters; ſo, hills
and mountains muſt, of neceſſity, riſe
out of the body of this great Mother.</p>
                     <p>11. This is evidenc'd both by anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and modern Experiments, which tell
us of Iſlands caſt up in the Sea: we hear
of cinders belcht out of <hi>Aetna</hi> and <hi>Veſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius;</hi>
for the moſt part, falling upon
and encreaſing the Mountains, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
too, raiſing fields into Mountains:
and, hence it is, that Mountains, for the
moſt part, ingender Metalls and are
full of wholeſome hearbs, as is generally
obſerv'd.</p>
                     <p>12. Hollow places, whether upon the
Superficies of the Earth, which we call
<hi>Vallies,</hi> or <hi>Caverns</hi> within its bowells,
proceed from two proper cauſes: the
ſinking and ſettling of the Earth into
thoſe places, which the matter for the
Mountains left vacant; and the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away of that matter which, by rains
and torrents, is carry'd otherwhere, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
into the <hi>Sea.</hi> Thus, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115975:77"/>
of Rivers are made; thus, between
vaſt and very high Mountains, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells
of the Valleys are deeper: Hence,
in one place, the Earth is hollow'd away,
in another rais'd.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Sea, and its Accidents.</head>
                     <p>1. THe parts of water are Sea, Lakes,
Pools, Rivers, Fountains. The
Sea is but <hi>one;</hi> ſince, all thoſe
parts, whereof every one is call'd a Sea,
communicate among themſelves, either
openly, or by hidden Channells: as, the
Caſpian diſcharges it ſelf into the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xine;
for, otherwiſe, twould overflow with
the conſtant tribute of ſuch great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                     <p>2. That the <hi>Main</hi> does not overflow,
is becauſe of the amplitude and vaſtneſſe
of its ſurface: whence, it comes to paſſe,
that as much is lick'd up by the Sun into
clouds and winds, as is pour'd in by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Rivers; as will be evident to one that
ſhall obſerve how much the Sun, in one
day, draws up out of a little Plaſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:115975:78"/>
3. Hence proceeds its <hi>ſaltneſſe:</hi> for, ſince
the ſalt which flows in out of the Rivers
makes not them ſo much as brackiſh; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could <hi>they</hi> infect the ſea, were it not
that, the ſun ſucking up the lighter parts,
the ſalt remains in the reſt.</p>
                     <p>4. Moreover, the ſalt, which the ſun
muſt neceſſarily make upon the top, out of
the concoction of the land-floods which
fatten the River-water, does not ſink
down to the bottom; both by reaſon of
the motion of the ſea continually ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it together; as alſo becauſe, the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the water, the ſalter and heavier it is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
ſome ſpeciall cauſe interpoſe, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in the mouths of Rivers.</p>
                     <p>5. From the abundance of ſalt, the ſea
gets both <hi>denſity</hi> and <hi>gravity;</hi> moreover,
that it will not extinguiſh flames very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily;
as alſo, by a multiply'd reflection of
light, to ſparkle and flame, as it were, when
'tis ſtirr'd.</p>
                     <p>6. The ſame, too, is no little cauſe of
<hi>Sea-ſickneſſe,</hi> (beſides the very toſſing,
which, of it ſelf, is a cauſe; as appears in
thoſe who are ſick with riding in a
Coach); for, the ſtomack, being offended
with the ſaltneſſe, ſtrives to caſt it up; as
appears by that ſalt humour we oft are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of in colds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="tcp:115975:78"/>
7. Hence, too, comes it, that the ſea is
not <hi>frozen;</hi> the mixture of ſalt hindring
the freezing wind's entrance: For, where
the ſea is congeal'd, 'tis not the ſea-water,
but the <hi>ſnow</hi> falling on it, which makes the
ſea ſeem frozen; as our Countrey-men,
that go Northern voyages, witneſſe. Yet,
others report that, near the ſhoars, a ſharp
wind will freez the ſea in ſome, ev'n hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Countreys.</p>
                     <p>8. But, when vaſt Rivers flow into nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Bayes, they muſt needs overflow into
larger ſeas: whence, of neceſſity, there muſt
needs be a kind of perpetuall flux of ſome
ſeas into others; as, of the Euxine into
the Propontis, of this into the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,
of the Mediterranean into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean.
The reaſon is, becauſe the leſſer
ſea, with the ſame quantity of water, is
more ſwell'd and, conſequently, has a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
levell of water: Again, the power of
the ſun drinks more out of a larger ſea
then out of a narrower; whence, 'tis more
eaſily ſunk low to receive the adventitious
waters.</p>
                     <p>9. Out of the ſea, the ſun, like fire out
of a boyling pot, extracts continuall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours;
which, either in <hi>Rains</hi> or <hi>Winds,</hi> it
diſperſes over all the Earth: for, all thoſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115975:79"/>
Winds, which we feel cool from the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
in the Summer, though we perceive it
not, yet, both their extraction makes us
confeſſe they are moiſt, and their denſity
and <hi>ſoftneſſe,</hi> ſavouring a ſimilitude of and
derivation from Water.</p>
                     <p>10. The Earth, therefore, heated by
the Sun, being ſprinkled with theſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Rain or Wind, (for the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once hot, a great while retains it) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
it ſelf into Vapours: and ſo, by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little, they are rais'd to the higher
parts of the <hi>Earth;</hi> where if they feel the
cold of the Aire without, or, by any other
cauſe, are coagulated into bigger parts,
they become <hi>Water,</hi> and by degrees, break
themſelves a paſſage through and flow
down upon the lower grounds.</p>

                     <p>1. ANd, becauſe the cauſes of evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
are continuall, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
too, continually flow;
which, joyning together, make Brooks
and Rivers, and, when they have watered
the whole ſurface of the Earth, reſtore to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115975:79"/>
the Sea the ſuperfluous moiſture, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
again the Earth with a new diſtillation.</p>
                     <p>2. Let him, that thinks not the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
ſufficient for this, imagine the
Mountains, out of their innate heat, are
more pory then the reſt of the Earth, and
hollow, as we have ſaid; wherein there may
be receptacles of water: out of which the
heat, that is every where mingled, often
draws vapours, which it tranſmits to the
top of Mountains covered with Rocks;
whence, afterwards, water ſtarts, as it were,
out of bare Rocks.</p>
                     <p>3. That this is the generation of <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
the ſtones and earth at a Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
all deaw'd like the cover of a boiling
pot, are an argument: alſo, the thinneſſe &amp;
ſubtilty of the vapours ſo rais'd through
the Earth; &amp; certain herbs, too, nouriſht by
ſuch like vapours: by obſerving all which,
the <hi>Water-finders</hi> ſearch for Well-ſprings.</p>
                     <p>4. Of Fountains, the famouſeſt are <hi>Baths,</hi>
that is, hot ones. The Authour of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative
Phyſick,</hi> ripping up ſome foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
both learnt himſelf and convinc'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by the very courſe of nature and by

full of a ſalt (which he calls <hi>hermeticall)</hi>
with a mixture of Sulphur, will grow hot.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:115975:80"/>
5. The ſame may be ſeen in watred lime;
and in Tartar, with the ſpirit of Vitriol in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
in it: The cauſe of all theſe is the
ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> The fiery parts, fetter'd, as it
were, in dry bodies, being ſet at liberty by
the mixture of a liquid body, diſſipate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vapours that liquour, it conſiſting of
parts eaſily diſſolvable.</p>
                     <p>6. Hence, it appears, why cold foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
ſometimes of the ſame favour, are
next neighbours to hot ones, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe
they paſſe not through the ſame ſalt.</p>
                     <p>7. Why ſome are more, ſome leſſe hot,
<hi>viz.</hi> either through the abundance of this
ſalt, or through its nearneſſe to the mouth
of the Fountain.</p>
                     <p>8. The ſame Authour evidenc'd the
conſtant laſtingneſſe of the heat to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
from the <hi>naturall</hi> reparation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit
of the ſame ſalt; when, extracting
the ſalt, he found the remaining mud ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd
again within three dayes: not by the
raining of ſalt down out of the Aire (as
that Authour thinks) but by the nature of
the <hi>Earth's</hi> being ſuch that, mixt with Aire,
it turn'd into ſalt, or, ſalt was made of the
moiſt Aire and that Mud.</p>
                     <p>9. It appears, again, why ſome Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
have wonderful vertues, either in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115975:80"/>
or prejudice of our bodies: why o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
convert Iron into Copper: others
petrifie ſticks and whatever is thrown into
them: why ſome yield gold, others ſilver.</p>
                     <p>10. Namely, becauſe, flowing through
ſeverall ſorts of Earth, they rub off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them little particles and duſt; ſo
minute, ſometimes, that they are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable
from the very body of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and then the water is reputed to have
ſuch a vertue; ſometimes they are viſible,
and then the water is ſaid to carry ſome
ſuch thing in it.</p>
                     <p>11. Of Fountains flowing out, <hi>Brooks</hi>
and <hi>Rivers</hi> are made; whoſe running, they
ſay, requires the declivity of one foot in a
Mile: Their reaſon is, becauſe a line touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Earth, at a Miles end, is rais'd nine
inches; Artificers, therefore, adde three
inches more, that it may conveniently run;
(whence, the fountains of Nilus ſhould
be almoſt a mile and half higher then the
Port of Alexandria); but erroneouſly: for,
when ever the water running behind is ſo
encreaſed, that it be able to raiſe it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the water before, this rule of decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
changes.</p>
                     <p>12. Among Rivers, 'tis ſtrange one
ſhould ſwim upon and, as it were, run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115975:81"/>
another; as, Titareſus upon Peneus, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſthenes
upon Hypanis: The reaſon is, the
gravity of the one and the lightneſſe of
the other; or, they will not mix out of
ſome other cauſe, as, if one of them be
oily.</p>
                     <p>13. The overflowing of Rivers in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
proceeds, either from the melting of
Snow ſhut up in Vallies, or from an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Rain, falling in a far-diſtant Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
and therefore not ſuſpected by us;
as is evident, in Nilus, Niger, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of no name and ſcarce any better
then Brooks.</p>
                     <p>14. Fountains, if they emerge into a
hollow place of the Earth, beget a <hi>Lake:</hi>
and, if this cavity happen in any elevated
Superficies of the Earth, whether in a
Mountain or a high Plain; it comes to
paſſe, that ſometimes great Rivers flow
out of Lakes: And ſometimes vaſt eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
of waters, without any appearing
cauſe; when a Lake empriſon'd in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells
of a Mountain, ſuddenly overflows
and opens it ſelf a way.</p>

are done in it near the Earth.</head>
                     <p>1. THe <hi>Aire</hi> is evidently divided into
two parts; that which is habitable
by Animals, and that above: this
laſt has no limits we can know of; that firſt
is contain'd in the Sphear of Vapours
which aſcend with a ſenſible heat out of
the Earth, that is, as much as the Sun che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
with its heat and renders fit for the
life of Animals: This, therefore, is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively
hot; the reſt comparatively cold,
which the Snows and cold winds about the
higheſt Mountains teſtifie. A third, which
they uſe to call the <hi>Middle Region,</hi> there's
none; ſince the place of Meteors is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
ſome reſiding near the Earth, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
above the Moon.</p>
                     <p>2. Out of the Globe of Earth and Sea,
by the power of the Sun, little bodies are
rais'd up, of the minuteſt bulk; which, the
Sun deſerting them, ſometimes fall down
upon the Earth like drops, and are call'd
<hi>Deaw;</hi> ſome drop from hard by, others
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115975:82"/>
from a great height; for, all night long va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
deſcend, and the higher more ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
both becauſe they are higher and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
every drop is leſſe: Hence 'tis that
Chymiſts rather chuſe the Deaw that falls
laſt, as alſo the ſummer Deaw, theſe being
the pureſt and ſubtileſt.</p>
                     <p>3. From this <hi>Deaw</hi> 'tis, that the night
grows cooler towards day-break; though
the firſt Drops breaking and diffuſing
themſelves, intends the ſame cold by the
expiration of their cold parts.</p>
                     <p>4. The drops of Deaw, eſpecially the
leaſt, are perfectly round: the cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is, becauſe the water of Deaw is very
tender, and encompaſs'd in and bound
together with a skin, as it were, by the
more viſcous Aire about it.</p>
                     <p>5. As we ſee, therefore, Bladders blown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up
become round, becauſe in that figure
they are capable of moſt Aire: ſo, every
fluid body, when 'tis ſtraightned, muſt of
neceſſity mould it ſelf into a round form.
And, this ſeems the cauſe why <hi>Quickſilver</hi>
ſo eaſily runs into little ſphears: for, ſince
the leaſt fire will vapour it away, the leaſt
cold, too, muſt needs compreſſe it.</p>
                     <p>6. Some Deaws are ſweeter then the
reſt, eſpecially in the hotter Regions;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115975:82"/>
whence, a kind of Hony may be lick'd
from the leafs of Trees, and the <hi>Bees</hi> are
believ'd to make their hony out of Deaw;
alſo, the <hi>Manna,</hi> in <hi>Calabria</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> and
other hot Regions, is a kind of Deaw;
<hi>Cloves,</hi> too, and <hi>Nutmeggs</hi> are thought to
derive their ſweetneſſe from a kind of
Deaw which falls in the <hi>Molucco</hi> Iſlands:
Now <hi>ſweetneſſe</hi> proceeds from a concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and digeſtion of Moyſture, into a
certain oily ſoftneſſe and equability of
parts.</p>
                     <p>7. <hi>Froſt</hi> is congealed Deaw. A <hi>Fogg</hi> or
<hi>Miſt,</hi> properly, is the expiration of the
Earth or Water out of a certain Vent
made by their native heat: For, we ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
perceive Foggs riſing out of moiſt
Valleys, Lakes, Rivers and the Sea: they
preſently fill all our Horizon: then, for
the moſt part, they riſe either in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Evening, ſeldome when the Sun
ſhines hot: they riſe, too, in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
out of ſome certain place. All
which agree not to Vapours extracted by
the Sun.</p>
                     <p>8. And, becauſe they expire out of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
water, they ſtink and beget a Cough.
But, that which uſes to reſt upon Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and in Woods, eſpecially when it
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115975:83"/>
rains, is another thing: for thoſe are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Clouds, not Fogs, which either fall or
are ſuſtain'd by the leafs of Trees; whence,
in certain Iſlands, we read there's no other
water, then what is ſo gather'd and diſtill'd
from Trees. Some Miſts are purely wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
others have a kind of ſlimy muddy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
withall, deriv'd out of the quality of
that body whence they are ſublimated.</p>
                     <p>9. The <hi>Nets</hi> we ſee in trees &amp; hedges, as
alſo thoſe <hi>thrids</hi> that fly up &amp; down ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
are made by the parts of the Fog
growing together; or, of little bodies, too,
rais'd up by the Sun: minuteſt humid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
gluing together other minuteſt dry
ones; that we may learn, out of theſe rude

vapours higher, they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
into Clouds: Now, a <hi>Cloud</hi> is a ſwarm
or heap of minuteſt bodies elevated by the

up ſtaies a great while in the Aire: Beſides,
the motion of the Aire hinders their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending;
wherefore, in a high wind, we
fear not the Rain, which, as ſoon as the
wind is down, preſently falls.</p>
                     <p>4. Now, that which makes it fall is the
forcing thoſe little bodies into a ſtraight
place; and, therefore wind brings Rain,
becauſe it thruſts the little drops one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
another and makes them bigger.</p>
                     <p>5. Beſides, the wind it ſelf is often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
with the Vapour and, by ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them, makes thoſe particles, which
before were too little, now to be big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
and fit for deſcending: as, when a
warm wind ruſhes againſt a cold vapour, or
contrariwiſe: and therefore, cold winds
in the Summer and warm ones in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
chiefly bring Rain.</p>
                     <p>6. But, becauſe thoſe things that are rais'd
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115975:84"/>
out of the <hi>Earth</hi> aſcend, not onely from
the <hi>Superficies,</hi> but out of its very Bowells,
too, through the pores: nay, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
and thruſt out from the bottome of
the Sea, and the Earth under it; the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
forcing whatever is diſſolved in the
bottome, lighter then it ſelf, to aſcend:
And, becauſe there is a perpetuall viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Vapours, bandy'd from the Poles
to the <hi>Aequator,</hi> and from the <hi>Aequator</hi>
back again to the Poles; theſe <hi>Conſequents</hi>
follow:</p>
                     <p>7. That little particles are drawn up
into the Aire and Clouds, of all kinds of
Earth, clayey, ſtony, nitrous, bituminous,
metallick, &amp; whatever other ſorts there are:
again, of all ſorts of Plants, Trees, Roots,
Animals: all which being hurry'd up and
down in the Clouds from one part to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
are ſcattered; and, if any where they
come to find a convenient receptacle and
nouriſhment, there ſuch things or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are produc'd.</p>
                     <p>8. But, becauſe ſome are apt to be
form'd ſuddenly; (as, Froggs eaſily grow
out of Mud; and, 'tis told by a man of
credit, that a certain Chymiſt, in a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour, brought certain ſeeds to
grow): it happens ſometimes, ſuch as
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115975:84"/>
theſe, too, rain out of the Clouds.</p>
                     <p>9. So, it rain'd Wheat, ſome yeares
ſince, in the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> or rather,
ſomething like Wheat; and the ſame, I
believe, thoſe other miraculous rains are
to be accounted, <hi>viz.</hi> that it rain'd not
bloud, but a red water, ſomething craſſe it
may be; and not Iron, but a kind of ironiſh
ſtone; ſo, too, not Fleſh, but ſomething
like Fleſh may have rain'd other where:
For, we are wont to call things by the
names of others which they reſemble, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
when ſomething of miracle is
joyn'd with it; ſo greedy we are of ſeeming
to know or have ſeen ſomething more
then others.</p>
                     <p>10. <hi>Snow</hi> and <hi>Hail</hi> ſeem to be accidents
of Rain; with this difference, that ſnow
is rain whilſt 'tis yet in ſuch little parts
that it cannot deſcend; but Hail is it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd,
when 'tis in ſuch drops as are apt
for deſcending: For, that the generation
of Snow is higher then that of Rain, the
tops of Mountains witneſſe, cover'd all
the yeare with Snow; which they could
not be, were they ever drench'd with Rain.</p>
                     <p>11. And, that 'tis congeal'd in minuteſt
particles, is evident, to one that conſiders
it, both from the height of its place and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115975:85"/>
the very nature of Snow; for, the flakes
are not of one continu'd body, but, as it
were, aſhes or little duſts made up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Its whiteneſſe, too, proves it, that is,
its eminent virtue of reflecting light: for,
ſuppoſe a world of little ſphears, ſmooth
and extreamly minute, made up together
into one body as little as can be viſible;
and, becauſe every one of thoſe convex
<hi>Superficies</hi> are apt to ſcatter light; in its
proportion, from every point, that quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
muſt needs appear extreamly white.</p>
                     <p>12. The <hi>Rine,</hi> too, witneſſes it, and a kind
of ſnowy-hail we ſometimes ſee like <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
Confits:</hi> for, certain minute particles
of ſnow are eaſily diſcernable; and, if one
look very curiouſly upon a flake of ſnow,
one ſhall diſcern a compoſition without
end, as it were, of diſtinct bodies coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
Laſtly, the whiteneſſe of Froth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
clearly from the ſame cauſe.</p>
                     <p>13. Hence, the doubts about ſnow are
eaſily reſolv'd: as, why the vapours ſhould
not rather immediately fall down in Rain,
then turn into Snow; ſince there needs a
leſſe intenſe cold for Rain? For, either
they are admitted to be firſt in the degree
of Rain, before they become Snow; but
deſcend not, becauſe the parts are too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115975:85"/>
yet: or it muſt be ſaid that Rain does
not ſignifie every moiſture, but a dropping
one, ſuch as is not in ſo minute parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
The cauſe, too, of its ſoftneſſe is
plain; for, even Diamant duſt, if it be
ſmall enough, will be ſoft.</p>
                     <p>14. Again; why 'tis often ſexangular, or
rather like a Star with ſix rayes? For, ſince
ſix other equall circles juſt encompaſſe
and incloſe a Circle; if Snow be compos'd
of little Sphears, the firſt compoſition
will have ſix jettings out, to which
thoſe things may ſtick which, in motion,
are apt to touch and ſtop againſt what
they encounter: Such a compound, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
is apt to be form'd into a ſtar-like fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
                     <p>15. The cold, if it has been very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe
and dry, ſlacken's before Snow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Snow's moiſture; eſpecially,
if it come with a gentle, a South, or Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind:
as alſo, becauſe a ſnowy cloud more
compreſſes and ſtraightens the Aire near
the Earth; whence, the Vapours which riſe
out of the Earth, being thruſt and croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
cloſe together, grow warmer; and thus,
too, <hi>Snow,</hi> lying upon houſes, makes the
upper rooms warmer, by hindring both
the entrance of the wind and the iſſuing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115975:86"/>
of the vapours. In the ſame manner, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
it protects the Earth and Roots from
the cold.</p>
                     <p>16. But, the warmneſſe, which is felt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fall of Snow, proceeds from the
free action of the Sun, which before was
reſtrain'd by a groſſe cloud interpos'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it: as alſo, becauſe the cold where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we were infeſted, whilſt the cloud
hung over us, lyes now, as it were, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd
and impriſon'd under our feet. That
the falling of Snow hinders Sounds, 'tis,
becauſe it deprives the Aire of its agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>17. <hi>Hail</hi> is Rain congeal'd in falling:
it receives a figure either from the drops,
or from the wind and the colliſion of the
drops now growing hard, or elſe by
chance or the concurrence of accidentall
cauſes.</p>
                     <p>18. Thoſe that diſcern monſtrous
forms and ſhapes in it ſometimes, poliſh
and finiſh up, by the help of their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
certain rude lines: as 'tis often ſeen
in Stones and whatever other figures.</p>
                     <p>19. That it ſo ſoon melts, the reaſon
is, becauſe there remains in it more water,
then of the dry vapour; the wind or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealing
Aire having light upon great
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115975:86"/>
drops: For, that this is the cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation,
our expecting Ice and a Rine
the next day witneſſes; to wit, when the
wind is grow'n ſharper by the cold of the
night.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of fiery Meteors appearing in the
Aire.</head>
                     <p>1. WHo'd expect Fire out of water?
Yet we have it ſometimes out
of the Clouds, and even out
of Rain: Nay, in a very Tempeſt, there
ſtick to the Maſts things, the Ancients call'd
<hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux;</hi> a wonder familiarly ſeen
by the Mariners.</p>
                     <p>2. But theſe and many ſuch like ſeem
rather to relliſh the nature of vapours
that reflect light, then of Fire: for,
both <hi>(Will of the wiſpe,</hi> or) <hi>Ignes fatui</hi>
do not burn nor flame out, but only
ſhine; as alſo thoſe <hi>Dioſcuri</hi> (or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi>
and <hi>Pollux)</hi> have the form of a
globe, which is not the figure of Fire.
Again, Flames, in a thin and tenuous
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115975:87"/>
matter, are not long-liv'd; as appears in
Lightning, and in a Candle, which we ſee
ſometimes blaze up, enflaming the ſmoak
about it; but ſuddenly extinguiſh again
and retire to the Wiek: The flames, too,
which belch out of the <hi>Vulcanian</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
are often but ſhort-liv'd.</p>
                     <p>3. Be this therefore a ſure rule; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the figure is determin'd and conſtant,
'tis no fiery or flaming matter: For, the
way of Fire is, to brandiſh Pyramids up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
with an uncertain motion; the
craſſer matter preſſing downwards.</p>
                     <p>4. Beſides, an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> has been found
fallen down in a ſlippery viſcous ſubſtance
full of white ſpots: The ſame, too, is the
matter of Falling-ſtarres; as, both a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man hath found it; &amp; amongſt our
ſelves, when any ſuch matter is found in
the Fields, the very Countrey-men cry
it fell from Heav'n and the Starres, and,
as I remember, call it the <hi>Spittle of the
Starres.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Ignes fatui</hi> (or <hi>Wills of the Wiſp),</hi>
then, are a certain viſcous ſubſtance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
light in the dark, evaporated out
of a fat Earth, and flying in the Aire.
They commonly haunt Church-yards,
Privyes, and Fens; becauſe they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115975:87"/>
out of fatneſſe: They fly about
Rivers, Hedges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe in thoſe
places, there's a certain flux of Aire: They
follow one that flies them and fly one that
follows them; becauſe the Aire does ſo:
They ſtay upon Military Enſigns and
Spears; becauſe ſuch are apt to ſtop and
tenacious of them: In the Summer and
hot Regions they are more frequent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the good concoction produces fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Flammae lambentes</hi> (or thoſe we call
<hi>Haggs)</hi> are made of Sweat or ſome other
Vapour iſſuing out of the Head; a not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unuſuall
ſight amongſt us when we ride
by night in the Summer time: They are
extinguiſht, like flames, by ſhaking the
Horſe Mains: But, I believe rather, 'tis
onely a Vapour reflecting light, but fat
and ſturdy, compacted about the <hi>Mains</hi> of
Horſes or Men's Hair.</p>
                     <p>7. <hi>Cardanus</hi> tells of a certain <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,</hi>
that as often as he thruſt his head into
his Coul, it flam'd out; and that 'tis uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
enough in <hi>Spain,</hi> for ſparkles to fly out
of woollen garments rubb'd upon ones
head: Nor doubt I but theſe are reall fire
ſuch as uſes to fly out of Wood, Canes,
or Flints, by rubbing or ſtriking them,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115975:88"/>
for theſe and ſuch like are full, both of
fire, and a certain vapour which is fewell
for it; whence, when many hot parts
light upon a conſiderable part of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
they ſcorch and kindle it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
after ſuch a production of fire,
there remains in ſome an offenſive ſent, as
of burning.</p>
                     <p>8. The Hair of Horſes, and Cats,
as alſo Sugar rub'd together in the dark,
are ſaid to produce the ſame effect:
The Eyes, too, of ſome are ſaid to ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle,
<hi>viz.</hi> when they ſhine with ſpirits,
and reflect the light as if they were glaſſe.
Yet doubt I not but the Eyes may,
by ſome preternaturall diſpoſition,
yield reall light; it ſeeming evident in
Cats.</p>
                     <p>9. But, that the moſt part of theſe are
idle ſtories, I collect from this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that it has ſeem'd, even to my
ſelf ſometimes, that my Chamber was
all light; and I ſaw every thing plainly:
when, notwithſtanding, I have often
catch't my ſelf in it, and found mine
eyes ſhut all the while; and that my
memory within, was working upon thoſe
thiings which I thought I ſaw: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I found that I err'd, too, imagining
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115975:88"/>
ſome things to be in this or that Place,
which indeed were not.</p>
                     <p>10. <hi>Falling-Stars</hi> are a certain viſcid
or ſlimy matter, rais'd out of the Earth
in very minute parts, and coagulated
in the Aire; which, when, in its fall, it
comes within our ſight, beautifies all
its way with reflected light: Yet, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
it falls not downwards; but,
being carry'd traverſly by ſome moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Aire, 'tis call'd a <hi>Gliding ſtar,</hi>
'till, either being diſſipated, or by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Accident, 'tis ſeen no more.</p>
                     <p>11. <hi>Caprae, Trabes, Bolides, Faces, Dolia,
Clypei,</hi> (as the Ancients call them), or
whatever other names ſuch Meteors may
have; whether they are reall fires, or only
certain Clouds brighter then ordinary;
neither is it deducible clearly enough out
of Hiſtories, (they relating ſcarce any
thing ſave that they burn in ſuch a figure;
but that they take burning for ſhining
'tis very credible, even from hence, that
they mention no tokens of their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning);
nor have I ever met with any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
curious obſerver treating of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of truly fiery Meteors, hanging in
the Aire.</head>
                     <p>1. THe true fires, therefore, are
<hi>Lightnings, Dragons,</hi> and thoſe
they call <hi>Fire-Drakes:</hi> For, firſt,
they have not a clear brightneſſe, as <hi>falling</hi>
and <hi>gliding</hi> Stars have (which is almoſt a
ſure ſign of reflection), but a dimm'd one
(from the condition of the matter) as it
were with ſmoak, as we ſee in our fires;
though this rule may fail on both ſides,
unleſſe it be prudently apply'd: Again,
they are ſhort-liv'd: Thirdly, the aſhes
of Dragons are often ſeen, and the effects
of Lightning are well known. The Nature
of Fire-drakes is like that of Lightning or
the blazing of Candles; ſo that 'tis, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably,
a ſudden kindling of an oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vapour; and it varies its figure with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
motion, as fire uſes, according to the
various diſpoſitions of the combuſtible
matter. To apprehend the Cauſes of theſe
things,</p>
                     <p>2. Let us imagine the hotteſt days ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115975:89"/>
that upon the Earth, which, upon a
Chymicall matter, the moſt intenſe heat
does, that, after the gentler, is apply'd to
extract <hi>Oyles,</hi> that is, the moſt glutinous
and craſſe moiſture: Suppoſe that, out of
fat and ſoft grounds, they raiſe Vapours,
not liquid, but compacted with a deal
of denſe matter, not without a vaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of fiery parts impriſon'd in
them.</p>
                     <p>3. That theſe Vapours can neither be
elevated into a very high ſtation, nor long
ſuſtain'd above: That, yet, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the heat, they are carryed
higher (according to the nature of the
Region and of the concurring cauſes) in
one Climate then in another: And that,
through the motion and tumult of the
Clouds, theſe vapours meeting with one
another, being of a glutinous ſubſtance,
ſtick together and are conſtipated; that,
being conſtipated, they are kindled, and,
being kindled, either break out or are
thrown out.</p>
                     <p>4. Again; this matter, being the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt
of all that are elevated, will be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
downwards, as we ſee in <hi>Golden-gunpowder:</hi>
for the dilating of the fire
makes and applyes an impreſſion of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115975:90"/>
adhering matter, that way which the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
leads: It breaks, therefore, through
the Clouds, there, where 'tis eaſieſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending;
and being, in the time of its
paſſage, for the moſt part, directed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely,
becauſe the Cloud is thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
towards the Earth, 'tis, ſo, hurry'd
to us.</p>
                     <p>5. When nothing but the flame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
us, 'tis ſaid to <hi>lighten:</hi> when,
without Thunder and in a clear ſeaſon, any
lightnings appear, we ſay it <hi>flashes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. Hence, 'tis apparent enough how
<hi>Thunderbolts</hi> come to be darted out of the
Clouds: For, the fire in the Clouds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extreme violent, it bakes a light ſtone,
like a <hi>Pumice</hi> or thoſe which are made in
furnaces for Metalls: and that, having
the fire ſtill adhering to it, and being
light of its own nature, is carry'd,
like an iron kettle or earthen Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringer
in water, and deſcends with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                     <p>7. Again; 'tis evident how <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
is caus'd: For, that moſt ſuddain
rarefaction of Fire cannot be made,
without a moſt ſwift compreſſion of
one Cloud to another; nor this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a mighty noiſe, ſuch as we hear
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115975:90"/>
at the ſuddain extinguiſhing of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and intenſe fire, and at the daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together of the waves of the Sea in a
Storm.</p>
                     <p>8. From the different matter of
the Lightning there happens the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of different effects: As, when,
the Purſe or Scabbard being intire,
the Mony or the Blade is melted; it
proceeds from hence, that, in the
Lightning, there is the nature of thoſe
Salts, which ſerve to melt Metalls and
yet have no power upon ſlighter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
when the Wine congeals, the
Veſſell being broken; 'tis a ſign of
cold Spirits in the Lightning, by which
liquid things are rendred conſiſtent
and hard things are broken; as we
ſee by the congealing of water in a
glaſſe or earthen veſſel cloſe ſtop'd:
when water will not quench it, it has
a mixture of <hi>Wild-fire</hi> in it, ſuch as we
ſee in burning Fountains.</p>
                     <p>9. <hi>Iron</hi> is us'd againſt Lightning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis a kind of matter ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin
to Lightning, and draws the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
ſpirits to it ſelf, ſo that it does other
things no hurt: <hi>Mushromes,</hi> too, come
on the better for Tempeſts, becauſe the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115975:91"/>
Rain which accompanies them is warm
and fat; as the fields of <hi>Aetna</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania</hi>
are rendred more fruitfull by the
eruptions of the Mountains, becauſe
much heat and fat matter deſcends with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
                     <p>10. Hence, that they call the <hi>Fiery
Dragon</hi> is a certain weaker kind of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
Its livid colour, and its falling
without noiſe and ſlowly demonſtrate a
great mixture of watry exhalation in it:
nor is there any thing elſe of ſingular in
it worth taking notice of; for, 'tis ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for its ſhape, that it has ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
of a Dragon, not the expreſſe
figure.</p>

for it brings down with it, even
to the Earth, that whirling <hi>impetus,</hi>
and, being reverberated, as it were,
back into the Aire, hurries away, wrapt
up in it, whatever it meets unable
to reſiſt it upon the Earth: All theſe
winds are properly call'd <hi>Storms</hi> and
ſtormy.</p>
                     <p>3. Some ſigns, by the providence of
God, they ſend before, of their coming;
as all vehement things do: which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
hence, that, in corporeall things, a
part muſt of neceſſity be made before
the whole; and, in motion, the weaker
muſt goe before, the violenter muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p>4. Hence it comes, that Animals have
a kind of ſenſe of Storms before they
come. Again, becauſe, for great things,
there muſt precede great preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
a change in the cauſes may, by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
perſons, be obſerv'd: ſo Mariners
foreſee future Storms, by the Sun, the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115975:92"/>
Moon, the Clouds; and Shepheards,
Heardſmen and ſuch others, by their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</p>
                     <p>5. Out of what has been ſaid, 'tis ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to conceive the <hi>Generation of Winds:</hi>
For, if a vapour or exhalation be either
ſo dry or ſo ſcatt'red that it cannot coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
into great drops, it deſcends in
the form of duſt; and, where it firſt finds
reſiſtance, there it begins to take a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
and make, as it were, a channell
of its Motion.</p>
                     <p>6. And, that way the firſt parts have
gone before, the later follow, (by the
force of conſequence, now, and the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus</hi>
of the Aire) and make way for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
Thus, therefore, they run through
the <hi>Horizon,</hi> till either the Sun has ſuck'd
them up again, or their Atoms have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd
to other bodies, eſpecially moiſt
ones, with which they are eaſily incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
                     <p>7. Hence, may be reſolv'd the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
about winds: For, firſt, if the
exhalation be high, it makes <hi>the Rack
ride,</hi> but it comes not near the Earth:
when there happen to be many exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of ſeverall lightneſſes, the Clouds
appear to ride ſeverall ways: when the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115975:92"/>
cauſes of the exhalations hold out perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly,
the wind laſts longer from
the ſame corner: when the vapours,
flowing in from one corner, are more
denſe and abundant then from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then the wind is more vehement on
that ſide.</p>
                     <p>8. And this happens, either from the
quality of the Earth whence they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted:
for, out of a moiſt and cold
ground, the vapours are denſeſt; out
of a moiſt and hot, moſt abundant;
out of a dry and cold, they are ſtill light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
out of a dry and hot ground, they
are lighteſt of all.</p>
                     <p>9. As alſo, their way is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd:
For, they mix themſelves with
the vapours through which they paſſe,
and are imbu'd with their qualities. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
much is to be aſcrib'd to the Heat
which diſſolves them: for, a moderate
heat diſſolv's thoſe that are more ſubtle,
a violenter thoſe that are heavy and
thick.</p>
                     <p>10. It happens, too, that the nature of the
Corners from whence the wind comes, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
alt'red ſometims: for example,
If, from the North, for the moſt part, come
dry and fair-weather Vapours; it may well
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115975:93"/>
fall out that the Vapours carry'd by the
South-wind, when they are paſt us towards
the North, meeting with a ſtronger North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,
will be brought back to us pouring
down rain; and ſo, from a ſerene corner
we ſhall have rain, and, contrary-wiſe, fair
weather from the South.</p>
                     <p>11. Out of the ſame Principles, may
be underſtood the reaſon of <hi>Eteſiae,</hi> that is,
Winds that alwayes return at ſuch a ſet
ſeaſon of the year: For, the originall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Winds being certain and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
(among which, the melting of the
Snows is the principall), which return at
ſet times of the year; the Winds, too, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
ſomething interpoſe, muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
at the ſame Seaſons. Such are the
Northern <hi>Eteſiae:</hi> Theſe conſtantly blow,
in <hi>Italy</hi> and all over <hi>Greece,</hi> at Midſummer;
riſing, as I believe, out of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> not
from the fartheſt North, ſince they are not
felt in the intermediate Regions: And
they riſe out of the Earth after 'tis moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the Snow; for the Snows are ſaid
to melt about the end of <hi>May;</hi> whence, 'tis
plain, they that blow at the middle of <hi>Iune</hi>
cannot be rais'd, but out of the Earth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
well watred; unleſſe perhaps ſome
Snows hid in the Valleys are then firſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115975:93"/>
of the Sun's violence, or that the Sun
ſhould draw a cool breath of Aire out of
the Snows without melting them.</p>
                     <p>12. Such are the Eaſt-winds, which we
have in <hi>England,</hi> out of <hi>Ruſsia</hi> and <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
about the end of <hi>March</hi> and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>April,</hi> for fourty dayes together
ſometimes, upon the firſt diſſolving of the
Snow in thoſe parts. Such are the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds
the Weſt of <hi>England</hi> is ſubject to, at
the latter end of Summer and beginning
of Autumn; brought to us from that part
of <hi>America</hi> under the ſame Meridian, over
a vaſt Sea and out of moiſt Regions,
whence, for the moſt part, they are
rainy.</p>
                     <p>13. It appears, out of the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
why ſome Winds are heavy and
low, others light and high: For, 'tis plain,
theſe conditions muſt needs follow the
quality of the Subject whence the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
are rais'd, and of the heat that raiſes
them: For, as Chymiſts, with a ſoft fire,
extract the pureſt and lighteſt <hi>Spirits,</hi> but,
with a violent heat, heavy and troubled
ones; ſo Nature, too, with a moderate &amp; gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
heat, raiſes the purer &amp; ſublimer winds;
but the heavier, more vehement, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
winds it forces out with extreme heats.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:115975:94"/>
14. Hence, again, 'tis plain, ſome are
wholſome, others hurtfull: ſince, their
effects muſt needs follow the condition
of the nature of thoſe vapours whereof
they conſiſt. But, we muſt note, that
ſome winds have very guiltleſſely got an
ill name: for, thoſe that in one place
are unwholſome, in another are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
                     <p>15. The Sea-winds are commonly
unwholſome, as bringing along with
them heat and moiſture, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of corruption: Yet, in very hot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
they are wholſome; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the height of Summer, becauſe,
then, they refreſh; and becauſe they
are drawn up higher by the Sun, they are
penetrative, without any harm.</p>
                     <p>16. 'Tis to be noted, that the winds
always take the compaſſe of the greateſt
Circles: becauſe, being thruſt out with
violence, they take the ſhorteſt line;
which, upon the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of a Sphear,
is the <hi>Arch</hi> of the greateſt Circle.</p>

both our experience of Pits ſunk,
and many extraordinary effects demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
Fire &amp; water, there, too: there muſt
neceſſarily be notable effects of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
extracted out of the bowells of the
Earth.</p>
                     <p>2. If, therefore, out of ſome ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
humidbody, vapours chance to be
rais'd, by a ſubterraneous fire, too; and
they prove too bigg for their place: 'tis
manifeſt that, alwaies increaſing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
condens'd, by the continuall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of new vapours, they'l ſeek themſelves
a way out, according to the force they
have, where ther's the eaſieſt paſſage. If
that chance to lead into any vaſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground
Cave, the Earth will quake with a
great <hi>impetus</hi> and groan; but nothing will
appear above ground.</p>
                     <p>3. But, if the eaſieſt iſſue be towards the
<hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the Earth, the vapour will
burſt out through it: and, if it be
noxious to Beaſts or Birds, 'twill bring
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115975:95"/>
either Death or a Diſeaſe along with it;
making with the eruption either a gaping
Hollow or a Mountain, according as the
Earth either ſinks or is ſuſtain'd and, as it
were, vaulted. Sometimes 'twill bury and
ſwallow up Cities; ſometimes tranſport
vaſt pieces of Earth; and produce other
effects, whereof we find expreſſe memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
in Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>4. The Prognoſticks of an Earth-quake,
they ſay, are an infection of the Fountains
with a ſulphurious ſavour; an unuſuall
calmneſſe of the Air and Birds; a ſwelling
of the Sea without any apparent cauſe;
blackiſh ſtreaks under the Sun of an unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
length: all (if they are truly Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
and not onely Accidents, which,
ſometimes and not for the moſt part, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen)
are the effects of a ſpirituous Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
burſting out from the bowells of the
Earth.</p>
                     <p>5. They are ſaid to happen chiefly in
the Spring and Autumn, therefore, (if the
opinion be true) becauſe the <hi>Superficies</hi> of
the Earth, being warm, becomes ſlacker
with the rain: But, I ſhould rather believe
it a chance that many ſhould be recorded
in Hiſtories about theſe ſeaſons; for, both
Winter and Summer have felt their Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115975:95"/>
and in the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> where they
are moſt frequent, the differences of
Spring and Autumn from the other ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are very inconſiderable.</p>
                     <p>6. The Sea-ſhores are moſt ſubject to
theſe motions; becauſe the ſubterranious
flames and fumes receive no little nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the Sea; and the moiſture
which <hi>ſoaks</hi> into the Earth, renders it very
fit for breeding vapours.</p>

its parts, which are uſually call'd
<hi>Meteors,</hi> muſt neceſſarily be
found, too, in the other bodies, which, we
have ſaid, are enlightned by our Sun: And

                     <p>3. 'Tis evident, too, that our Sun can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

that reflect light to us: for, if it were as far
diſtant from us, as Aſtronomers ſuppoſe

                     <p>4. Adde to this, that one that ſhould

the very Aire, through which

it has nothing of fire but the colour:
adde to this, that <hi>Fromundus,</hi> with

of that Comet in the Year 1618, to
conſiſt of the reflection of the Sun's

                     <p>7. Be it, therefore, A vapour which
partly reflects the light of the Sun,
partly, drinking it in, either repells
it back again to us by refraction from
it ſelf, or, letting it through, by
reflection from another body: And,
its fore-part will be the Head, its
hinder (whether part, or ſomething
only acceſſnry to it) will be the
Tayle.</p>
                     <p>8. And ſince, by this generation of a
Comet, any figure of its Beard, any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
any winding of its tayle, but, for

ſaid,<note place="margin">Leſſon 10.</note> it appears that the
<hi>gravity</hi> of the vapours and
the ſtraightneſſe of their iſſue are the
cauſe of the violent motion of the winds;
and that the heavieſt vapours are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
out of the Earth, when 'tis well moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
It becomes evident that, where va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115975:97"/>
are rais'd out of the Sea only, they
are lighter; &amp; that, if they be turn'd into
winds, without being ſtraightned, they will
be calm ones. And, ſince, in the great <hi>Pacifick</hi>
Sea, in the <hi>Indian</hi> &amp; <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, quite
through the whole <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> there are
vaſt waters, &amp;, conſequently, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
ſecure from the incurſion of Shore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds:
there muſt needs be light vapours
rais'd up by the Sun through all that
Tract, which, the Sun retiring, muſt turn
into winds, taking that courſe which the
Suns rarefaction of the aire makes moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;
&amp; this, all the year long; &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there muſt be a <hi>continuall</hi> Eaſt-wind.</p>
                     <p>2. And, becauſe the Aire naturally
moves in a Circle, ſtill yielding and flying
before it ſelf; it muſt needs turn again
by the Shore-ſide, drawing along with it
the Vapours it finds; yet, not ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as under the <hi>Aequator,</hi> becauſe of the
Shore-winds.</p>
                     <p>3. Moreover, eye-witneſſes affirm, that
Eaſt-winds range for 27 degrees of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
from the <hi>Aequator</hi> on each ſide; and
Weſt-winds the next ten: and, of Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
in the <hi>Pacifick</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Sea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
eleven thouſand Italian miles; and,

about 70 degrees, that is, ſome four

allow the <hi>Aequator</hi> twenty one thouſand
miles, theſe winds poſſeſſe, thus, almoſt
three quarters on't.</p>
                     <p>4. Since, therefore, notwithſtanding
its calmneſſe, this wind carryes great ſhips
eight miles an hour; it muſt of neceſſity
drive the waters themſelves, in the middle,
with great violence, towards the Weſt:
whence they muſt needs overflow upon
the ſhores, and return again from the
ſhores to the middle; and, where they
meet any ſhores, withſtanding their courſe
to the Weſt, be reflected towards the Eaſt:
as alſo, they muſt ruſh into all the Bayes,
and, after a determinate time, return again,
according to the winding of the ſhores;
the account of which time muſt be taken
from the common Channell.</p>
                     <p>5. We have found, therefore, an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
cauſe why the Sea ſhould fill the
ſhores with its motion towards the Eaſt
and Weſt, and empty them again, with a
conſtant courſe, which we call the <hi>Ebbing</hi>
and <hi>Flowing</hi> of the Sea. That this proceeds
from an extrinſecall cauſe, &amp; not becauſe
the water moves leſſe, that is, ſlowlyer then
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115975:98"/>
the Earth, appears from hence, that the <hi>Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing</hi>
and <hi>flowing</hi> is diſcover'd, in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
not very deep, to extend not above ſix
fathoms; all the reſt of the water is calm and
like a Lake: whereas, if the Ebbing &amp; Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
follow'd from the motion of the Earth,
it muſt alwayes be mov'd ununiformly
from the botto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> upwards; without any ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
beginning of the conteſt of the Waters.</p>
                     <p>6. Hence the reaſon may be given why
the Flux proceeds from Eaſt to Weſt &amp; back
again, in the open Sea; why no ſwelling
ſhould be perceivable in the Mid-ſea, but
only at the Shores: The reaſon is, becauſe
there are no marks by which we might take
the height of the Sea; for 'tis found to
ſwell there, too, if any Iſland occurre, how
far ſoever from any other Shore.</p>
                     <p>7. Moreover, why there ſhould be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
Flux of the Sea obſerv'd, towards
the Weſt; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe this wind in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Sea perpetually drives the waves
towards the Weſt.</p>
                     <p>8. Why, too, the Flux ſhould be more
vehement in one part then in another:
<hi>viz.</hi> from the abundance of waters flowing
in, and directed by other cauſes the ſame
way; as, by Rivers, or the repercuſſion of
the Shores beating the greateſt part of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115975:99"/>
floud together againſt ſome one ſhore.</p>
                     <p>9. Alſo, why there ſhould be ſix hours
<hi>Flood,</hi> and as many <hi>Ebbe:</hi> for, ſince the
wind proceeds from the Sun, and the Sun
enforces its activity upon one part, for
ſix hours, and remit's it as many; there
muſt needs be the ſame generall Periods
of its effects, that is, of the Sea's Motion.</p>
                     <p>10. But, ſince the Moon, too, may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to encreaſe the wind; and, the nearer
'tis the Sun, the more its power is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
with the Sun's, the farther 'tis from
the Sun, the larger and ſtronger its force
is upon the <hi>Ocean;</hi> who can doubt but the
Flux muſt be encreaſed twice a Moneth?</p>
                     <p>11. In like manner, ſince the Sun is
twice a year in the <hi>Aequator,</hi> in which
place, as juſt in the middle, it moſt vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
rayſes the wind: every ſix moneths,
too, the Flux muſt be more eminent; but
eſpecially about Autumn, becauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn</hi> and the
<hi>Aequator,</hi> it rains mightily night and day,
for three moneths together after the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Solſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. But, that the Flux returns every
day about an hour later ſtill, 'tis from
hence, becauſe the Flux and reflux pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from oppoſite cauſes; whole forces,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115975:99"/>
before the victory, muſt needs be but
equall, and, by reaſon of their equality,
require a convenient time. Whence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
ſix hours for the flux and as many
for the reflux, each muſt be allowed its
intervall; which, in the <hi>Thames,</hi> (if I well
remember) is little more then a quarter of
an hour: This ſpace, therefore, thus, four
times repeated, in one day, makes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more then an hour.</p>
                     <p>13. Sometimes too, the winds ſtop the
Flood; inſomuch that, without a Miracle,
the Flood has three times advanced and
been beaten back in the <hi>Thames,</hi> by the
force of an oppoſite wind. Laſtly, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
why, in ſome Seas, there's no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Flux; as, in the <hi>Red,</hi> the <hi>Euxine,</hi>
the <hi>Meotis,</hi> the <hi>Caſpian</hi> and <hi>Baltick</hi> Seas:
ther's the ſame reaſon for them all; that
they are but little Seas, and have but
narrow entrances; that, vaſt Rivers run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into them, their <hi>ſuperficies</hi> is higher
then the Ocean's; that their current into
the Ocean is ſo ſtrong, that the Sea, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> whoſe Flux is not
very high upon the Grecian Shore, is not
able to repell it.</p>

                     <p>1. SInce, therefore, the upper part of
the water is continually mov'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Weſt: (and, as, becauſe
the water in the middle runs one way,
that by the Shore-ſide muſt needs run
backwards; ſo alſo, becauſe the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
water is hurry'd towards the
Weſt,) that which is next under it
muſt needs be driven back to the Eaſt,
and whatever ſo adheres to it that there
is no cauſe of ſeparation; that is, which
will eaſilyer be driven towards the
Eaſt then be ſeparated from the lower
water.</p>
                     <p>2. But, one part of the lower water is
not ſeparable from another, unleſſe it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
aſcends into the place of that above
it, which another part, ſupervening, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
and hinders; or elſe, unleſſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells
that which is Eaſternly to it, and that
again another, and, in the end, the laſt,
the Shore that's oppos'd againſt it, which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115975:100"/>
is incredible and impoſſible: The whole
body, therefore, with the Earth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to it, muſt needs be driven to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Eaſt, unleſſe there be ſome
reſiſtance ſtronger then the impulſe.</p>
                     <p>3. Whereof ther's none in its <hi>gravity,</hi>
becauſe that motion is not contrary to
the motion of <hi>gravity;</hi> and its bigneſſe
even much facilitates the motion: The
Earth, therefore, will be mov'd in a
Circle, and turn round about its own Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
becauſe this impulſe is made in a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
                     <p>4. Again, becauſe 'tis almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
this impulſe ſhould be equall on all
ſides, and cauſe a pure rotation about
the Centre; there will, of neceſſity,
a Progreſſive motion be mixt with it.</p>
                     <p>5. And ſince, as a body cannot be,
but in one place, ſo neither can it move
but in one line: all the motions which
Aſtronomers aſſign the Earth muſt, of
neceſſity, compoſe one line; and, if
the laſhing or impulſe of the under-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
advance the Earth in that line, 'twill
be an adequate cauſe of the motion of the
Earth.</p>
                     <p>6. Now, Aſtronomers teach, that the
Earth, continually turning about its own
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115975:101"/>
Centre, runs under the <hi>Zodiack;</hi> its <hi>Axis</hi>
retaining a certain inclination to the <hi>Axis</hi>
of the <hi>Zodiack:</hi> wherefore, when we have
found out a line, in which the Earth, being
thruſt on, will obſerve this motion; the
Flux muſt be imagin'd to move the Earth
according to that.</p>
                     <p>7. Aſtronomers prove theſe motions of
the Earth: becauſe, otherwiſe, greater
motions of greater bodies muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd;
and thoſe, neither themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
nor proportion'd to the bodies, and,
beſides, more entangled, both in the Stars
and in the Sun it ſelf, as is apparent by its
<hi>Spots:</hi> Which if you ſay make not up a
perfect Aſtronomicall Demonſtration, that
Maxime muſt be renounc'd upon which
all Aſtronomy depends, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
(or <hi>appearances) are to be ſolv'd the beſt
way we can.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. Again; becauſe there follows a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the fixed ſtars, from the diverſity of
the Earth's poſition in its <hi>Orbis Magnus;</hi>
when there's once found out a <hi>Teleſcope,</hi> of
ſuch perfection as to be able to diſtinguiſh
that variety, we may expect a Geometricall
Demonſtration: and becauſe, for the ſame
reaſon, there muſt needs be a variety of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
from <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Iupiter;</hi> when the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115975:101"/>

                     <p>1. AStronomers object, that this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
transferring of the Earth
would cauſe a diverſity of eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in thoſe Stars which are near the Poles,
and a variety in the appearing bigneſſe of
thoſe in the <hi>Zodiack:</hi> which, ſince we ſee not
follow, neither is there any ſuch thing as
this Annuall motion of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>2. 'Tis anſwer'd; The vaſt remoteneſs
of the Fixed Stars renders ſuch variations
imperceptible: and, that their diſtance
from us is ſufficient to produce this effect,
may be collected from the effect it has up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <hi>Teleſcope;</hi> which, though it amplifies
ſo much the Planets and even <hi>Saturn</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
yet adds nothing or an inſenſible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Fixed Stars.</p>
                     <p>3. Out of this motion of the Earth riſes,
Firſt, the reaſon of Night and Day: for,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115975:102"/>
ſince, in a determinate time, 'tis roul'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
its Centre, (ſuppoſe in about 24
hours), the things that are in the Heavens
muſt needs appear ſometimes, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
diſappear, to a determin'd place of
the Earth: and, <hi>ſuch</hi> a variety, in reſpect
of the Sun, makes <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night;</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the other Stars, a variety not
own'd by any common name.</p>
                     <p>4. Again, by its motion under the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack,</hi>
it attains various conjunctions with
the other Planets.</p>
                     <p>5. Laſtly, in that it carries its <hi>Axis</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſtill towards the ſame parts of the
Heavens, it comes to paſſe, that the part of
the Earth, enlightned by the Sun, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſometimes greater ſometimes leſſer
parts of the <hi>Parallells,</hi> according to which
the Diurnall motion proceeds; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
that the dayes are longer and
ſhorter.</p>
                     <p>6. Thence, too, is it, that the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
more perpendicular at one time
then another; whence the natures of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Summer</hi> are deduc'd, and the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Declinations, Deſcenſions</hi> and <hi>Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. But, that the Winter is ſhorter then
the Summer, proceeds from this, that the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115975:102"/>
Motion, through the inequality of the
bodies rais'd up in the Winter time, is ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then in the Summer.</p>
                     <p>8. An effect, too, of the Motion of the
Earth is the carrying of the water about
with it; but not the <hi>Tyde:</hi> Firſt, becauſe,
if the Earth ſhould ſtand ſtill, the water
would ſtand ſtill withall;<note place="margin">B. 2. Leſ. 10. N. 1.</note> ſince,
as we have ſaid above, ther's
no impetus but from the <hi>gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and <hi>ſuch</hi> there would be none in the
preſent caſe.</p>
                     <p>9. Again, ther's no cauſe of the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
motion of the water; ſince, ther's
the ſame quality continually in the mova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and not by skips.</p>
                     <p>10. Again, if the whole water of the Sea
were ſo mov'd, 'twould drown the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains:
Laſtly, the periods of the Earth's
motion do not agree with thoſe of the
Tyde's.</p>
                     <p>11. But, that the Flux depends on an
extrinſecall Agent, which impells only the
<hi>Superficies</hi> of the Sea, is moſt evident; by
the experiment of a late <hi>Diver,</hi> that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

the Earth; and its effects.</head>
                     <p>1. OUt of what has been ſaid, 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
inferr'd, that the Aire,
which clings to the Earth, is
roul'd, in the ſame manner, <hi>about</hi> or rather
<hi>with</hi> the Earth: For, ſince, both by the
nature of Quantity and the weight of its
<hi>gravity,</hi> it preſſes towards the Earth, and
ſticks to and incorporates with it; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
without ſome greater force interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
be ſeparated from it: Since, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in it, ther's no reſiſtance againſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and onely a reſiſtance againſt being
torn away from the Aire next it, which
takes another courſe; and this reſiſtance
is not greater then that againſt being
torn off from the Aire below, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not ſo great, (ſince Aire is ſo much
the lighter the higher it is); Tis evident,
it will follow the Earth: Wherefore, to
the very confines of the emanations of
ſome Star, that has a different Motion,
the whole Aire will be roul'd about with
the Earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:115975:103"/>
2. And, experience alſo proves it: for,
elſe, the twilight vapours, Comets, and
Birds above the higheſt Mountains would
ſeem hurryed extream ſwiftly towards the
Weſt. Again, 'tis plain, thoſe Clouds of
duſt, which we call the Sun's ſpots, fly
along with the Sun; and that, the ſame
way, (as appears, becauſe the bright parts
are burned ſtill the ſame way,) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they are judged to be a hundred
miles diſtant from the Sun. The vapours,
too, of the Moon are found to be carried
about with the Moon.</p>
                     <p>3. From this Motion of the Aire it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that bodies in the Aire it ſelf are ſo
moved, in reſpect to the parts of the Aire
and the Earth, as if there were no Motion
at all in neither; they being carried ſtill
along together with the Aire it ſelf: as,
one in a Ship, under ſaile with a conſtant
wind, exerciſes the ſame Motions and
with the ſame facility in the Ship, as he
could do if ſhe ſtood ſtill.</p>
                     <p>4. Wherefore, Arrows, ſhot juſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
will fall in the very ſame place; or,
ſhot towards the Eaſt, they'l fly no farther
then if ſhot towards the Weſt: The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Earth will raiſe no wind, &amp;c.
This, too, will be certain, that the Aire
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115975:104"/>
cannot be carry'd leſſe then the Earth; as,
one that ſits in a Coach cannot rid leſſe
ground then the Coach it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>5. Nor can all theſe be made good by
an <hi>impetus,</hi> conceiv'd upon the Earth, and
remaining in the Movable after its ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Earth: for, neither could
Birds retain that <hi>impetus</hi> for many hours
together, at leaſt, without any nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
diminution; and leſſe could little
bodies, for many dayes: nor could
that <hi>impetus</hi> carry an Arrow as ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acroſſe, as directly. Beſides, as thoſe
that ſwimme againſt the ſtream feel the
ſtrength of the ſtream under water; ſo,
one that ſhould move towards the Weſt
would feel the Aire to be carry'd towards
the Eaſt.</p>
                     <p>6. Much leſſe, by the force of its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
motion, will the Earth throw any
thing laid upon it into Heaven: For, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
motion has no ſuch property in its
own nature; ſince 'tis ſtill about the
Centre, and, by conſequence, keeps e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing, according to its own line,
in the ſame diſtance from the Centre:
But, thoſe things we ſee thrown off from
wheels, are ſo, by reaſon of their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and the mixture of a ſtraight mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115975:104"/>
with the circular; as alſo, becauſe
the centre of gravity of ſuch thrown bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
is remov'd, from that poſition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it was ſuſtain'd by the body under
it.</p>

Moon and other Stars.</head>
                     <p>1. SInce, ſuppoſing this motion of
the Earth, the Moon is carry'd
with it about the Sun, and keeps
alwaies the ſame ſide towards it; 'tis fairly
convinc'd to have a kind of adheſion to
the Earth.</p>
                     <p>2. Yet, not a Magneticall one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it changes not its aſpect, nor has
any declination, for its approaching
the Poles; nor, though it hangs looſe,
does it come to the Earth: 'Tis, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
an adheſion of <hi>gravity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. And, ſince <hi>gravity</hi> proceeds from the
Motion of things deſcending towards
the Earth; the Moon muſt be ſituated
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115975:105"/>
within the Emanations of the Earth, be
carry'd about the Centre of the Earth, and
about the Sun. But, becauſe it has a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion
of its own towards the Earth, it is
not carry'd ſo ſwiftly as the Emanations
themſelves; its progreſſe being, according
to Aſtronomicall obſervations, but about
a 28. part every day.</p>
                     <p>4. And becauſe, under the <hi>Zodiack,</hi>
ther's a perpetuall tumult of vapours
which aſcend, and being come up to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
height, turn off from the <hi>Torrid Zone</hi>
towards the Poles; the motion of the
Moon is compounded of a Motion under
the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> and towards the Poles.</p>
                     <p>5. It is not, therefore, carry'd purely
under the Ecliptick: but, becauſe 'tis
mov'd in a Sphericall <hi>Superficies,</hi> and by the
ſhorteſt line, that is, by a greateſt circle;
it will cut the Ecliptick twice every intire
courſe of its <hi>defects,</hi> that is, every moneth.</p>
                     <p>6. In its <hi>Oppoſition</hi> and <hi>Conjunction</hi> to
the <hi>Sun,</hi> the body of the Moon, that is, the
whole complex of its ſolid and vapours,
becomes leſſe heavy: In <hi>Conjunction,</hi> becauſe
its nearneſſe to the Sun and the <hi>Sun's</hi> ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
reflection from the Earth raiſes more
Vapours in the Moon: in <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> more

part; and in the upper part ther's all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
abundance.</p>
                     <p>7. Wherefore, the Moon, in theſe poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
muſt riſe higher from the Earth,
and, in the <hi>Quadratures,</hi> that is, about the
paſſages from the firſt to the ſecond and
from the third to the fourth <hi>Quarters,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
bigger. But, becauſe that part which
looks towards the Earth is allways the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,
it never turns t'other ſide towards
us.</p>
                     <p>8. Nor is there any fear leaſt the Moon,
falling by reaſon of its weight, ſhould o're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
the Earth; both becauſe 'tis fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
with a great deal of fire and vapours
lighter then the Emanations of the Earth;
as alſo, becauſe very <hi>gravity</hi> it ſelf, near the
confines of the Earths emanations, is not
ſo powerfull as 'tis here lower.</p>
                     <p>9. But farther, becauſe 'tis hurry'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two thouſand miles every houre:
whence, were it made of ſolid Iron, it could
not fall down; ſince, we ſee iron Bullets
ſuſtain'd in the Aire, by the power of Guns,
though their motion be not two hundred
miles an houre.</p>
                     <p>10. Out of what has been ſaid, we may
eaſily argue concerning the other <hi>Great

                        <hi>Great Orbe</hi> either are mov'd about the

                     </p>
                     <p>11. And, becauſe we diſcover Suns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe other parts of the world;
'tis very credible there are proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

and that all thoſe Bodies are mov'd in the

                     <p>12. The Sun it ſelf muſt, of neceſſity,

                     <p>1. BUt, becauſe this fire, which burſts
out from the Sun's bowells, is
it ſelf mov'd, too: either this
Motion, which is the Mother of all other,
muſt ſpring from it ſelf; or elſe we muſt
come to an <hi>incorporeall Agent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. But, that Bodies which reſt, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſoever they are, cannot ſtart of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into Motion, is moſt evident: For,
being ſuppos'd to reſt, all their intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls
are ſuppos'd, without that effect
which is call'd Motion: Since, therefore,
all things remaining the very ſame in the
cauſes, there cannot be any change in the
effect; and yet, ſuppoſing Motion, there
would be a change; 'tis plain, there cannot
any Motion ſpring out of them, without
altering firſt ſomewhat in the cauſes, that
is, in the Bodies.</p>
                     <p>3. Moreover, every part of Motion being
a new effect, the ſame evidence convinces
that motion cannot be continu'd, without
ſome Cauſe be ſuppos'd continually alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Firſt Body, on which depend the
motions of all the reſt.</p>

                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:115975:107"/>
4. Since, therefore, we have purſu'd the
Originall of motion into the very bowells
of the Sun: we muſt conclude, that there
is a Mover of another nature, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall,</hi>
from whom Fire receiv's the power
of moving; who, being of an immovable
Nature, eſtabliſhes the Centre of the Sun,
that it may be the <hi>Fixer</hi> and, as it were, <hi>Baſis</hi>
of all things rouling about it.</p>
                     <p>5.<note place="margin">Leſ. 1. n. 1.</note> That Motion cannot be <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi>
the ſame argument convinces
which made it plain before, that
all Permanent Quantity is finite: For, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
backwards from this inſtant or <hi>now</hi>
wherein we are, an infinite Time already
paſt, there muſt be infinite hours paſt;
ſome one, therefore, will be infinite others
diſtant from us; and, in that one, a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<hi>now,</hi> which, with this preſent inſtant,
muſt encloſe an infinite on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>6. Nor, if the computation be made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
will the reaſon differ: for, there muſt
ſtill be infinite hours to come; and one of
them will be infinite others diſtant from
us; and, in that one, a certain <hi>now</hi> termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an infinite, which is impoſſible, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
yet, what is <hi>future</hi> is, in that very reſpect,
<hi>poſsible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. The <hi>World,</hi> therefore, is neither
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115975:107"/>
                        <hi>from</hi> nor <hi>to</hi> eternity: becauſe, the world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<hi>the motion of bodies paſsing on in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
order,</hi> and, as it were, conſiſts in
this. 'Twas, therefore, <hi>created;</hi> but, not for
it ſelf: for, if it could have deſerv'd to be
made for its own beauties ſake; upon the
ſame title, it would endure for ever. It
reſts, therefore, that 'twas made for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe; which cannot be ſucceſſive,
ſince the ſame evidence, with which we
have diſputed about motion,<note place="margin">N. 5. 6.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
that no ſucceſſive thing can
be eternall. The World, therefore, is made
<hi>for</hi> ſome permanent thing: but, there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
permanent found in Nature, except
the <hi>Rationall ſoul,</hi> for whoſe ſake the world
could exiſt: <hi>Spirits,</hi> therefore, born in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and perfected in them, (not ſuch as
are purely abſtracted from body, who
have no uſe of corporeall inſtruments)
are the <hi>End</hi> for which the world was made.</p>
                     <p>8. And, the world is nothing but a kind
of vaſt <hi>wombe,</hi> in which <hi>theſe Spirits</hi> may
be <hi>begotten</hi> and <hi>brought up;</hi> which has ſo
many <hi>Cells</hi> as there are ſeverall <hi>Races</hi> of
theſe Spirits. Our Cell is the Earth we
inhabit: the Cells of the reſt are thoſe
maſſes of the Celeſtiall bodies; except
the <hi>Solar</hi> ones, which are the <hi>baſeſt</hi> of all the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115975:108"/>
reſt, and, as far as we can gueſſe, only <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. The <hi>Quantity</hi> of the world, both for
its Extenſion and Duration, is ſuch as may
fitly ſerve for the breeding up ſo many
differences of Spirits: providing the Cells,
according to the ſeverall kinds; and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
every Cell the bigneſſe and duration
which was ſufficient for the number the

                     <p>10. The <hi>Figure</hi> of the world is not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
uneven, either with hollowneſſes or
jettings out; ſince, the notion of <hi>Vacuum</hi>
excludes both theſe: Wherefore, 'tis ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>3. Whence, tis inferr'd, that Subſtance,

                     <p>5. You'l object, Such as are one in Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
are one in Subſtance,<note place="margin">B. 2. leſs. 1. N. 4.</note> too:
But, the whole world is one in
Quantity; &amp; that rigorouſly, ſince, there
are no Parts actually in a Magnitude:
Therefore, either Quantity is a diſtinct
thing from Subſtance, or elſe all Bodily
Subſtance will be but one thing, really and
materially, whatever may be imagined
of an Intellectuall diſtinction between
them.</p>
                     <p>6. Tis anſwered, 'Tis a falſe aſſumption,
to ſay, thoſe things which are one in Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115975:109"/>
are one in their Subſtances, too. To
that which is objected, That all things
would be <hi>really</hi> and <hi>materially</hi> one; Tis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
Either 'tis but the ſame which we
call to be <hi>One quantitatively,</hi> and then
'twould be ſhew'd what inconvenience
would follow, that conſequence being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
or elſe, that term, <hi>really</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially,</hi>
would be explicated; for the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſeem to inſinuate that it ſignifies, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting
from our Notions, that is, they
would be one in no kind of unity whereof
we have any Notion.</p>
                     <p>7. All things, therefore, according to
that unity which follows the notion of
Quantity, (and that is accidentall,) are
<hi>one:</hi> but, according to their Subſtances,
and that unity which follows the notion
of Subſtance, they are <hi>many.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. It follows, from what has been ſaid,
As oft as any diviſion is made, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
it ſelf is chang'd, which is ſubjected
to the Quantity, according to the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecalls
of Subſtance, as 'tis condiſtinguiſh't
againſt Quantity: For, <hi>Diviſion</hi> being that
whereby <hi>more</hi> are made of <hi>one;</hi> and, they
not being made more according to the
proper unity of Quantity; this plurality
muſt, of neceſſity, be in the Subſtance as
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115975:110"/>
'tis condiſtinguiſh't againſt Quantity;
wherefore, the Unity, too, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd,
was in the Subſtance, as condiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh't
from the Quantity: ſince, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Vnity</hi> ſuperadds nothing to <hi>Entity,</hi>
but a negative notion of indiviſion; it
comes to paſſe, that a change cannot be
made in the unity without a change in the
Entity, and conſequently, that the Entity
is chang'd.</p>
                     <p>9. But, the Entity is not ſo chang'd,
that two Entities ſhould be made out of
<hi>nothing;</hi> but out of one that exiſted before:
otherwiſe, there would not have been
made a diviſion. There was, therefore, a
<hi>power</hi> or poſſibility in the Subſtance, to
be <hi>many;</hi> as, in <hi>many,</hi> ther's a poſſibility
to be made <hi>one</hi> again.</p>
                     <p>10. The Subſtance, therefore, is
chang'd, in ſome reſpect; and remains in
the <hi>many,</hi> according to ſome part of its
<hi>power:</hi> wherefore, 'tis divided according
to its own proprieties; and, there is, in
Subſtances, diviſible according to Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
another proper diviſibility, into the
<hi>Power</hi> by which it <hi>can be</hi> what it is, and the
<hi>Act</hi> by which <hi>it is</hi> what it is; or, into the
<hi>Matter</hi> remaining and the <hi>Form</hi> chang'd.</p>
                     <p>11. Yet, the parts of the Subſtance,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115975:110"/>
and the Quantity it ſelf with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
againſt which 'tis condivided, are
not <hi>actually</hi> in their compounds, before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion:
for, 'tis plain that, if they are <hi>in
act,</hi> one of them, before diviſion, is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
they <hi>are,</hi> therefore, <hi>many,</hi> nor can
be divided, that is, <hi>made many.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. Out of what has been ſaid, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that this <hi>Formall</hi> diviſibility has not
the true nature of diviſibility, that is, 'tis
leſſe then the diviſibility of a Magnitude
into its parts: For, a Magnitude is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into parts, whereof every one exiſts
after the diviſion, by their <hi>proper</hi> exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but, one, at leaſt of theſe parts exiſts
no longer, and that which remains exiſts,
not <hi>alone,</hi> but commonly with ſome other,
inſtead of the part it has loſt.</p>

in particular.</head>
                     <p>1. HEnce it follows that, becauſe a
change, according to the parts
of the Subſtance, changes the
Subſtance it ſelf; the parts are parts of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115975:111"/>
the Subſtance, as it is <hi>ſuch:</hi> wherefore,
neither part is a Subſtance; ſince a <hi>part</hi>
cannot be the <hi>whole:</hi> But, to be a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is, To have a nature capable of exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence:
therefore, neither part, ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is, by its nature, capable of a Being:
and, any Agent to give a Being to either
part, ſeparately, muſt firſt change its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that it may be capable of Being;
for, to exiſt, cannot agree to that, in
which there is not a power of receiving ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</p>
                     <p>2. And, after the ſame manner, muſt it
be ſaid of Quantity and all other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
whoſe notion is wholy <hi>without,</hi> and
not comprehended in the notion of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
and conſequently, their notion is
leſſe fit and apt for exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>3. You'l ſay, if theſe things are true, it
implyes a contradiction that any Accident
ſhould exiſt out of its own Subject; the
contrary whereof is a matter of <hi>Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. 'Tis anſwer'd, ther's neither Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
nor Demonſtration, in <hi>Theologie,</hi>
which convinces that an <hi>Accident</hi> may be
preſerv'd <hi>out of a Subject;</hi> as, 'tis plain,
to thoſe that look more attentively into
it.</p>
                     <p>5. But, on the contrary, 'tis evident a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115975:111"/>
Whole cannot be, without its Parts in <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiâ</hi>
or power, therefore a Subſtance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without Quantity, which is its parts
in <hi>potentiâ;</hi> nor can a Magnitude be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
its Quantity's having a determinate
proportion to its Subſtance, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Rarity and Denſity; again, Rare and
Denſe diverſly mingled, import all the reſt
of Corporeall Qualityes: 'Tis evident,
therefore, that Accidents cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Subſtance.</p>
                     <p>6. Farther, 'tis plain, the diviſion of
Subſtance is into a <hi>pure Power</hi> and a <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall
Form,</hi> or, that which makes it be a
Subſtance: For, ſince, by the diviſion of
a Subſtance into its parts, the Subſtance is
chang'd; it muſt needs be, that the Part
which is loſt gives the being a Subſtance
to the Whole, ſince, that being withdrawn,
the notion of Subſtance is taken away; and
that the remaining Part is a <hi>pure Power;</hi>
for, ſince 'tis a power to the notion that's
chang'd, and that is the firſt of all others,
'tis clear, in the remaining part ther's no
notion, and therefore, that 'tis a <hi>pure Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
or poſſibility.</p>
                     <p>7. Whence, again, 'tis clear, ther's a
greater unity of the parts of a Subſtance,
then of Subſtance to Quantity: ſince,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115975:112"/>
Quantity and Subſtance are, intellectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
diſtinct; but, of the Matter and Form
of compounds, ther's but one only notion
<hi>together.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. You'l ſay, 'Tis impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that Matter, of it ſelf, has no notion;
for, it would not be cognoſcible. 'Tis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd;
Since, to be capable of being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
neither is, in that kind whereof 'tis
capable of being, nor yet is wholly eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from that kind: ſo, that which is a
capacity to the firſt kind, that is, to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and Being, neither has it that firſt
notion, and yet 'tis not altogether eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from it; but, 'tis a certain <hi>degree</hi> to
participate Being it ſelf, by the mediation
of another.</p>
                     <p>9. Now the <hi>ratio</hi> or notion in a thing is
<hi>That,</hi> by which its nature is fitted to the
Underſtanding, or the Underſtandable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of a thing, or the quiddity, the <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
and, conſequently, that, whereby a
thing is made to Be: The Form, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
primarily, is the Cauſe, or the <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>
the Being is had.</p>
                     <p>10. Whence, 'tis evidenc'd, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be more Subſtantiall Forms, in the

ſince the firſt <hi>Form</hi> gives the Being,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115975:112"/>
the ſecond muſt needs be adventitious to
what has a Being, and not give it, but be an

they have each their own notions and,

                     </p>
                     <p>11. 'Tis plain, too, that the Matter has
a Being through the Form, and cannot be
ſuſtain'd otherwiſe then by the Form;
ſince, of it ſelf, it has not a capacity to
<hi>Be.</hi>

in common.</head>
                     <p>1. IT follows, from what has been ſaid,
that there is ſome plurality of Forms
in nature, before all Diviſion: For,
ſince Diviſion is made, by the <hi>interpoſition</hi>
of one body, between the ſides or parts of
another, there muſt neceſſarily be, before
diviſion, a body to be the Divider and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
that may be Divided; which, being
they are not more then one, through any
former diviſion, (ſince, this is ſuppos'd to
be the firſt,) this plurality muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
proceed out of the very nature and
notion of the Things.</p>

                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:115975:113"/>
2. And, ſince Eſſence is nothing but
that whereby a Thing is; ſuch Things
muſt be, eſſentially, diſtinct: Since, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to divide belongs to denſe, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
to rare; thoſe things that are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
rare and denſe muſt be eſſentially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct.</p>
                     <p>3. Since, therefore, ſuch things are
tranſmutable among themſelves, and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately
divide the Univerſe; the <hi>Matter</hi>
of rare and denſe things muſt be the ſame,
and conſequently, <hi>that</hi> of the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
                     <p>4. The ſame is deduc'd out of the very
notion of <hi>Matter;</hi> which, being a <hi>power</hi> to
the notion of a <hi>Thing,</hi> is alſo a <hi>power</hi> or
poſſibility to the notion of <hi>One:</hi> ſince,
therefore, a Multitude conſiſts but of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities;
before unity, neither diſtinction
nor multitude can be underſtood: There
can, therefore, be no multiplicity of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
wherefore, that of all nature is but
One.</p>
                     <p>5. Hence, then, thoſe Queſtions are
ſuperfluous, Whether one Form can be
the ſame in divers Matters? and again,
Whether many Forms in one Matter?
Since, if it be ask'd, of the proper unity of
Matter, that of all Forms is the ſame; if,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115975:113"/>
of the individuall unity, that the matter
attains by its conjunction with a Form, as
it does its very Being.</p>
                     <p>6. From what has been ſaid, 'tis clear,
that every body, that is, every Compound
of <hi>act</hi> and <hi>power</hi> is a Magnitude: For,
ſince ther's but one poſſible Firſt matter,
and that ſubject to Quantity; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
of it, too, muſt of neceſſity be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Quantity.</p>
                     <p>7. Hence, again, it follows, that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
moves, unleſſe, in ſome manner, it be
chang'd firſt: For ſince a Bulk excludes
another out of its place, by this, that it
intrudes it ſelf into the other's place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
two cannot be together in the ſame
place; unleſſe it become greater then its
own place or leave it, it cannot exclude an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
'Tis manifeſt, therefore, that it
muſt be altered firſt, according to one of
theſe mutations, if it become a Mover of
another.</p>
                     <p>8. Hence, again, 'tis collected that a
Body is, eſſentially, an <hi>Inſtrument:</hi> For,
ſince a Body has two properties, to be
<hi>mov'd</hi> and to <hi>move;</hi> and, to be <hi>mov'd</hi> apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to it, out of its <hi>power</hi> and the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Matter; 'tis clear, the eſſentiall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it is to be taken from its vertue of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115975:114"/>
                        <hi>moving,</hi> by which it expreſſes <hi>act,</hi> and which
follows the nature of a body in reſpect as
it actually is: Since, therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a body
does not <hi>move,</hi> but in as much as 'tis <hi>mov'd;</hi>
clearly, according to its eſſentiall notion,
'tis an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of its mover or applyer.</p>
                     <p>9. <hi>A BODY, therefore,</hi> is a Thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>or,</hi> A certain part of the Vniverſe; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Authour of Nature, to produce a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
determinate Motion, when 'tis apply'd.</p>
                     <p>10. Whence, three notions, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of defining a naturall <hi>Ens</hi> or Thing,
are diſcover'd: A Metaphyſicall one, which
is deduc'd adequately under the notion
of Being, and 'tis, A thing which has an
exiſtence ſpread into many potentiall
parts, that is, a Thing in or of ſuch parts:
A Naturall or Phyſicall one, which, by Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Qualities, expounds the notion of
thoſe parts and, conſequently, of the
Thing: And laſtly, a Morall one, as it
were, which collects the ſame from the
End, that is, from the quality of its Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for, the Metaphyſicall notion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
regards only its capacity of Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</p>
                     <p>11. And, he that has any one of theſe
three notions, even by that, has all:
for, the <hi>Senſible Qualities</hi> impart both a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115975:114"/>
                        <hi>capacity</hi> of <hi>Exiſtence</hi> and a <hi>power</hi> for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. Whence, too, it appears, that one
Body can have but one primary Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for, ſince the ſenſible qualities give
both the power of working and the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of exiſtence, and they, in the ſame part
of Matter, are the ſame; either they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
to one operation, or not: if not,
neither will it be one body, but many: if
they conſpire, there is, then, one primary
operation of ſuch a body; which could
not be produc'd, either by another diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
nor together with any other diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
then that. <hi>A naturall Body,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>is that One Thing whoſe Operation is
One.</hi>

Quantity is known to be infinite in <hi>power;</hi>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:115975:115"/>
the <hi>power</hi> of Matter, too, to Quantity muſt
needs be infinite: Since, therefore, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
Quantity is but finite; the <hi>Compoſit</hi>
or compound muſt needs be, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<hi>denſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. And, if whole Nature were uniform,
it muſt be eſtabliſht in a certain degree of
Denſity and Rarity, ſpringing from the
proportion of Matter to this Quantity:
but, the ſpeciall and particular bodies
which are in the Univerſe, as it is now fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
participate, out of this univerſall
proportion, ſome more ſome leſſe of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
and Rarity.</p>
                     <p>3. Since, therefore, the notions of
Denſity and Rarity are the firſt differences
of Magnitudes: thoſe bodies, which firſt
and leaſt of all exceed the nature of Body
in common, will be diſtinguiſh't by theſe
differences, that ſome exiſt in denſer
parts, others in rarer; which, in our <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks,</hi>
we have ſaid, are the Elements.</p>
                     <p>4. Since, therefore, the operations of
rare and denſe bodies, as ſuch, are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
and be divided; and this laſt is paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
out of which the eſſentiall notion is
not deduc'd; it comes to paſſe, that all
the Elements receive their differences, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their power of dividing: and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115975:115"/>
ſince, to divide is a kind of ſimple action;
they are diſtinguiſh't by no other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
then of more and leſſe, that is, of
velocity and ſlowneſſe.</p>
                     <p>5. Among the Elements, therefore,
thoſe which are fram'd by nature to divide
more ſwiftly muſt be more perfect; and
thoſe are they which are more ſubtile:
wherefore, ſince the greateſt force of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
agrees to Fire, that muſt be the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt;
next to which muſt be Aire, then Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then Earth.</p>
                     <p>6. Which laſt, though, by its Bulk and
denſity, it may ſeem more apt to divide,
and has, as it were, in the firſt place, the
nature of diviſive: yet, by reaſon of the
groſſeneſſe of its parts, in naturall action,
it can doe the very leaſt of them all; and
conſequently, 'tis the vileſt and moſt beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
Inſtrument.</p>
                     <p>7. It appears farther that, ſince a body
is, eſſentially, an Inſtrument for a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
motion; and there muſt needs be
ſome leaſt degree of rarity and denſity;
and the littleneſſe in bulk hinders both
the diviſive power and diviſibility: there
may be ſuppos'd, in every Element, parts
ſo little, that, according to the order of
the Univerſe, they may neither have a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115975:116"/>
of dividing others, nor of being
divided by others; and ſo, there may
not be in them the eſſentiall notion of
an Element, nor of any other naturall
body.</p>
                     <p>8. Again, ſince all bodies are
Conjoin'd;<note place="margin">B. 2. leſ. 2. n. 7.</note> it appears, that
ſuch minuteſt particles never
exiſt, but in compoſition with others:
nay, when ever two or more Elements are
joyn'd, it muſt needs be that their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes
may be ſuppos'd in ſo little a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
that one cannot operate without the
other.</p>
                     <p>9. There muſt needs, therefore, in
nature, out of the pure conjunction of the
Elements, be a notion of a certain body,
whoſe parts cannot act at all ſeparately,
but, in conjunction they may: that is,
ſome body eſſentially diſtinct from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements,
and yet, made out of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction;
that is, a body whoſe eſſence is
to be a <hi>Mixtum</hi> or mixt body.</p>
                     <p>10. But, ſince, in bodies, univerſally,
Unity and Magnitude are conſider'd: 'tis
plain, the differences of thoſe bodies are
collected out of three reſpects; the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall
difference of the Elements, that is,
the degrees of Denſity and Rarity; the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115975:116"/>
Multitude of parts of the ſame notion;
and their Bulk.</p>
                     <p>11. A <hi>Mixtum,</hi> therefore, <hi>is a body of
certain parts, of divers degrees of rarity and
denſity, in a certain number and bulk compacted
among themſelves, ordain'd by nature for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
Motion.</hi> Moreover, 'tis evident,
that the qualities of the Elements exiſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted
and mutually abated in mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
ſince, the very leaſt muſt needs ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
differ in degrees of rare and denſe, and
theſe degrees, by reaſon of the compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
muſt needs hinder one another.</p>
                     <p>12. And yet, that no ſubſtantiall Form
of any Element is found in a <hi>Mixtum:</hi>
ſince, a Form conſtitutes a <hi>Thing,</hi> and a
<hi>Thing</hi> is ordain'd for Motion; but, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is of the whole, not of the ſeverall
parts.</p>
                     <p>13. Out of what has been ſaid, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the operation of a <hi>Mixtum</hi> is a
certain Diviſion qualifi'd by the nature of
the parts of the <hi>Mixtum:</hi> which nature,
the better 'tis, that is, the <hi>more</hi> ſerviceable
for the <hi>beſt</hi> works of nature, ſo much the
<hi>nobler</hi> is the <hi>Mixtum,</hi> eſſentially.</p>
                     <p>14. Again, if the whole mixture of the
Elements be ſhut up into ſo little a part,
that one part cannot, ſeparated from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115975:117"/>
have its proper effect; then the <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
is ſimply one and <hi>primely</hi> mixt: but, if
the mixture be extended ſo amply, that
many parts may act, <hi>aſunder,</hi> according to
the divers parts of the temperament;
then, 'tis not a <hi>Mixtum,</hi> but a <hi>Demixtum</hi> or
<hi>Decompoſitum,</hi> that is, one made up of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Mixtum's;</hi> as we ſee in Metalls and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mines, as <hi>Coal, &amp;c.</hi> where many <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum's</hi>
are joyn'd together, which are apt
to be ſeparated by fire or other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>

are ſolid and conſiſtent, others
fluid; and of theſe, by the courſe
of nature, the conditions and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are different and, in ſome ſort, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite:
there muſt, of neceſſity, out of the
conjunction of theſe, riſe a middle temper,
which cannot but be fit for ſome certain
motions.</p>
                     <p>2. And, becauſe all things, with us
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115975:117"/>
here, are beſet with <hi>heat;</hi> the ſolid parts
cannot be kept moiſt, that is, mixt
throughly with actuall moiſture, unleſſe
there be ſome continuall cauſe or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
out of which the moiſture, ſo conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
and ſubject to be waſted by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of heat, may be perpetually ſupply'd.</p>
                     <p>3. Now, that Fountain may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
within and intrinſecall to the <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
or elſe conjoyn'd, that is, in a body
joyn'd to it: But, if it be this later way,
'tis plain, that watred <hi>Mixtum</hi> is not, of its
mere ſelf, conſtantly what it is, but
through its ſituation or conjunction to
another, from which, if it be ſeparated, it
periſhes.</p>
                     <p>4. But, that which is watred the former
way has, within it ſelf, what is neceſſary to
keep it ſtill a conſtant Inſtrument in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of that operation which 'tis fram'd
to undertake: and, conſequently, it has
one Form, from that one Operation 'tis
ordain'd to, and that one Order of parts
conform'd to ſuch an operation.</p>
                     <p>5. And, becauſe we find theſe in all and
only Animals: an <hi>Animal</hi> is evidently
counted to be <hi>One naturall Thing having one
Form.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. You'l ſay, if the ſeverall ſimilary
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115975:118"/>
parts of an Animal, ſubſiſting in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
forms, were connected; they'd have
the ſame effect as they have now in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal:
ther's no need, therefore, of the
particular form of an Animal.</p>
                     <p>7. 'Tis anſwer'd, Ther's no particular
nature in any ſimilary part of an Animal,
which is common to that part <hi>alive</hi> and
<hi>dead,</hi> as if there could be ſome form, as it
were, <hi>indifferent;</hi> but, the nature of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
part is contrary to the nature of a
dead part: Now, <hi>naturall Things are naturall
parts of the world, unerringly flowing from the</hi>
ESSENTIFICALL IDEA'S; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they receive eſſentiall notions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Order</hi> they have in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe.</p>
                     <p>8. But, becauſe the parts of an Animal
are ſo fram'd, that one ſhould water, that
is, alter or move another; 'tis plain that,
of neceſſity, they muſt be of ſeverall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and figures: wherefore, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
of them is an <hi>Organicall bodie,</hi> having
within it ſelf <hi>Life,</hi> that is, a power of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it ſelf; and, its <hi>Form</hi> is the <hi>Act</hi> of ſuch

                     </p>
                     <p>9. But, ſince the notion of a Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
that the parts of its ſubject, whoſe
orm it is, be ſome <hi>Movers</hi> others <hi>Moved;</hi>
                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:115975:118"/>
'tis clear, that it does not inform each of
the parts, or, is not <hi>in every part,</hi> as 'tis uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſaid, and as it happens in Elementary
forms; but, that 'tis only in the whole
and, immediately, the Form of the Whole.</p>
                     <p>10. Notwithſtanding, the parts have
not, therefore, partiall or particular
Forms: becauſe they are not <hi>actually</hi> in the
whole, nor have, <hi>actually,</hi> any nature by
which they could ſubſiſt out of the whole;
as appears, in that, being but <hi>divided,</hi> they
preſently <hi>die.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. Hence, 'tis collected, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
the <hi>Metaphyſicall</hi> notion of an <hi>Animal:
viz.</hi> that, <hi>'Tis a Thing of many parts, order'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves, as to Action;</hi> that is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſome are active upon others, and the
reſt are paſſive from them.</p>
                     <p>12. To which the <hi>Morall</hi> definition ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn's,
that <hi>'Tis an Inſtrument for Action,</hi>
that is, for that operation or motion to
which they apply themſelves; ſuch as is
locall motion, which all participate.</p>
                     <p>13. <hi>And, the</hi> Phyſicall <hi>definition conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that</hi> many Mixtum's are contain'd in an
Animal, as alſo Organicall parts, <hi>that is, parts
woven and compos'd of many</hi> Mixtum's;
and ſo conjoin'd, that the libertie of each is not
taken away, but that they are active upon
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115975:119"/>
one another, as if they were diſtinct Things.</p>
                     <p>14. And, ſince, from the preſence of an
Object, an impreſſion is made upon an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimall;
whence it begins to act about
that which is <hi>without,</hi> ſo as is convenient
for the nature it ſelf of the Animall; yet,
this impreſſion is, ſuch as makes no ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
change in the Animall: we apprehend
the Object to be in the Animall, as neither
perfecting nor hurting it, but indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and purely <hi>As another thing;</hi> and this
we call <hi>Knowing:</hi> and, that the Animall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates
out of it ſelf, as it were, what is
convenient for it, ſuppoſing this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and this we call <hi>working out of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. Again, becauſe it appears, by our
<hi>Phyſicks,</hi> that the proper motions of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimall
derive their <hi>Origin</hi> from the Heart,
which directs the Spirits into the nerves
that are neceſſary for all kinds of motion;
and that this Impulſe is call'd <hi>Paſsion;</hi>
moreover, that all <hi>Paſsions</hi> depend and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge
from LOVE and, in an Animall
rightly diſpos'd, are ſubject and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to <hi>love:</hi> It follows, that Its <hi>prime</hi>
Love, or, the proſecution of its chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
is that Paſſion or Motion or Action,
to which the fabrick and compagination
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115975:119"/>
of an Animall is immediately order'd; and
conſequently, that Animals, by <hi>theſe,</hi> excell
one another.</p>
                     <p>16. Now, the prime purſuit of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
is after <hi>Food;</hi> and <hi>Food</hi> is what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the quality of a body, and
preſerves and cauſes a right diſpoſition:
Since, therefore, an Animall agrees with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bodies in being an <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> to be
apply'd by another, and an Inſtrument is,
in ſo much, more perfect, as it can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
more eaſily and more efficaciouſly,
more or more Noble works; that Animall
will be better then the reſt, which is more
eaſily applyable, and to more things: for
commonly, the more noble operation
conſiſts of the more parts, and what's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
more eaſily operates more efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
                     <p>17. The Food, therefore, of that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
is beſt, which renders it of a <hi>calm Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
and of an <hi>Appetite</hi> the moſt <hi>indifferent;</hi>
which, commonly, follow one another:
and, that Animall is the <hi>beſt,</hi> which is <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily</hi>
affected to ſuch Food.</p>

                     <p>2. 'Tis plain, too, that nothing greater
can be imagin'd, in the notion of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal;
no, nor of a Body: For, if a <hi>Bodie</hi>
be an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> applyable to a <hi>determinate</hi>
action, an Inſtrument to all extends to
both the nobleſt and the moſt: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
nothing can be conceiv'd higher
in the notion either of a Body or an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall.</p>
                     <p>3. Since, therefore, in our
<hi>Phyſicks,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">B. 2. leſ. 24. n. 6.</note> it appears, that a
<hi>Man,</hi> even in his Body, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115975:120"/>
to do <hi>any thing whatever;</hi> 'tis plain,
that a <hi>Man</hi> is the <hi>prime</hi> both of <hi>Bodies</hi> and
<hi>Animals;</hi> and ſomething <hi>beyond</hi> them.</p>
                     <p>4. It appears out of what has been ſaid,
that there cannot be any other differences
of Bodies, which are not comprehended in
the fore-mentioned. For, the <hi>Elements,</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
in <hi>Rarity</hi> and <hi>Denſity,</hi> divide <hi>Body,</hi>
preciſely, as it ſpeaks Quantity united to
Subſtance: The nature of <hi>Mixtum's,</hi> which
conſiſt in the <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Proportion</hi> of rare
and denſe bodies, follows that diviſibility
of quantity, whereby bodies have num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and proportion: And, the <hi>Site</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of Parts we chiefly ſee in <hi>Animals,</hi> whoſe
members can act one upon another: Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the <hi>Infinitude</hi> of <hi>Quantity</hi> ſhew's it ſelf
in <hi>Man,</hi> in that he is ordinable, after a
ſort, to infinite things.</p>
                     <p>5. Again, ſince Quantity is diviſibility
into parts, thoſe are diſtinct either in <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
as it were, and <hi>Site</hi> only; and bodies
diviſible into <hi>ſuch</hi> parts are the <hi>Elements:</hi>
or, they differ in <hi>Nature;</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> are the
parts of <hi>Mixtum's:</hi> or, laſtly, they are parts
which, in the <hi>Thing</hi> it ſelf, are, as it were,
certain <hi>Things</hi> exerciſing their own <hi>proper</hi>
operations; <hi>ſuch</hi> are the <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;</hi>
the <hi>complex</hi> of which, if it makes a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115975:121"/>
body orderable to <hi>all poſsible</hi> Action, it
conſtitutes a <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. Again, the diviſion which a body
makes is, either ſimply dividing <hi>more</hi> and
<hi>leſse;</hi> and, by this, the <hi>Elements</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh't:
or, 'tis a <hi>modify'd</hi> diviſion, by
which certain bodies, with a certain <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
are diſtinguiſh't; and this is the
proper diviſion of <hi>Mixt</hi> bodies, by which
their ſo many effects are produc'd: or 'tis
an <hi>abſtractive</hi> diviſion, that is, which, of it
ſelf, has no effect, but is a way and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to another diviſion; and ſuch is the
motion of <hi>Animals;</hi> which, if it be in a
certain <hi>determinate</hi> manner and number,
conſtitutes the other <hi>Animals,</hi> if <hi>indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately</hi>
and with infinite variety, belongs to
<hi>Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. And, that theſe differences are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
appears from hence, that they, of
themſelves, divide and include the notion
and end of <hi>a Thing conſiſting of parts,</hi> that is,
of <hi>Body</hi> or bodily Subſtance; as <hi>cloven-footedneſſe</hi>
includes <hi>pedality,</hi> and the being
divided into three or four <hi>Toes</hi> includes
<hi>cloven-footedneſſe:</hi> for, no difference, of
any of theſe above-mentioned kinds,
can be underſtood without the notion
of <hi>a Thing conſiſting of parts;</hi> nor, be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply'd
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115975:121"/>
to any other common notion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
accidentally.</p>
                     <p>8. Nor, is it leſſe apparent, that theſe
eſſentiall differences are the very <hi>Accidents,</hi>
that is, the very <hi>complexion</hi> or clinging to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of rare and denſe parts: which is
call'd <hi>Subſtantiall</hi> or eſſentiall, in as much
as it furniſhes the body for its <hi>prime</hi> and
chief operation; and as, <hi>ſaving</hi> the order
to the chief operation, 'tis <hi>mutable,</hi> ſo far
'tis ſome of the <hi>Accidents:</hi> For, ſince the
parts are not <hi>actually</hi> in a formall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound;
'tis clear, that whatever is in the
Compound cannot be <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and diſtinct Things.</p>
                     <p>9. A tranſmutation, therefore, is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
only or more then accidentall, in
as much as 'tis greater or leſſe, or, as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to ſeverall notions.</p>
                     <p>10. Hence, again, 'tis evident, that <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nericall</hi>
unity, though it be founded in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(as appears out of what has been
ſaid): yet 'tis not truly any other then
Mentall (that is, by being in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding)
as to the effect of unity; though
the ſimilitude in which 'tis founded be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
                     <p>11. And that the ultimate eſſentiall u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which they term <hi>Specificall,</hi> and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115975:122"/>
common, is no other then the very
<hi>Individuall</hi> unity: For, ſince all difference
conſiſts of the collection of rare and
denſe, and all operation follows the ſame
differences in the very inſtant of the <hi>birth</hi>
or firſt being of every thing, when the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuation</hi>
is determin'd; it muſt needs
be, that whatever Accidents there are, in
the thing once made, either fit or avert it
from the primary operation, to which 'tis
ordain'd: Since, therefore, every change
in the <hi>Form</hi> makes an eſſentiall difference,
and all variety in reſpect of the <hi>primary</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
is a change in the Form, 'tis plain
that every Accident concurs to an eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
change; and (which was intended)
that <hi>Numericall</hi> difference, which is the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
and compleat proportion of a
Thing to its operation, is eſſentiall.</p>
                     <p>12. Wherefore, ſince, from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<hi>ratio</hi> or notion of <hi>a Thing conſiſting of
parts,</hi> one may deſcend, by numberleſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
to whatever Individuall; <hi>Generi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
degrees will be without any known
number, but the <hi>ſpecificall</hi> will be no other
then that of an <hi>Individuum.</hi>

in the ſeverall kinds of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</head>
                     <p>1. ANd, hence, 'tis evident that, a
Thing being chang'd but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally,
the Individuality is
not chang'd; becauſe that's taken direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under the notion of Thing or Body;
which is the laſt that's deſtroy'd in the
thing, as 'tis the laſt that's made.</p>
                     <p>2. For, ſince <hi>change</hi> is made by locall
motion, and that's diviſible without end;
if, upon every accidentall variation, the
Subſtance ſhould be chang'd, ſubſtantiall
tranſmutation would be continually ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive,
and would not ſubſiſt but in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that is, ſo, that one part would not <hi>be</hi>
whilſt another <hi>is;</hi> and conſequently, the
notion of a Subſtance would never <hi>be</hi> nor
its Being be Indiviſible; nor would there
be any Thing by whoſe mediation Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
might ſubſiſt; to conclude, there
would <hi>be</hi> nothing in Nature, the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115975:123"/>
and firmneſſe of Subſtance being once
taken away.</p>
                     <p>3. Among the Elements 'tis plain, the
Notion of the <hi>Individuum</hi> is chang'd by
mere diviſion; ſo that, any whatever leaſt
particle being taken away or added, the
notion of the <hi>Individuum</hi> is chang'd: But,
the quality of Rarity or Denſity being
chang'd, the notion of the <hi>Individuum</hi> is
not, therefore, altered.</p>
                     <p>4. For, ſince the mutation according
to Rarity and Denſity is a <hi>continuall</hi> one,
that is, diviſible without end; there would
be an infinite ſucceſſion of <hi>Individuums:</hi>
But, it appears to the Conſiderer, that it
happens not ſo in diviſion; whoſe Motion
though it be continuall, yet the being <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
follows indiviſibly. Beſides, if, both
by diviſion and change of rarity, the quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditative
notion of an Element ſhould be
varied, there would be no accidentall
change in the Elements.</p>
                     <p>5. Of <hi>Mixtums,</hi> the manner is partly the
ſame, partly different: for, if a diſſolution
intervene between the heterogeneall parts
which eſſentially conſtitute a <hi>Mixtum,</hi>
there will be a change, not of the <hi>Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
but of the Genericall notion; but, if
any parts of the ſame temperament be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115975:123"/>
added or taken away, the Individuall
notion is accounted chang'd.</p>
                     <p>6. But, the Unity of an Animal is not
prejudic'd by the withdrawing of neither
ſimilary nor diſſimilary parts; but only
of thoſe, wherein the <hi>prime</hi> force of its <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentality</hi>
preciſely conſiſts: and, that
being maim'd, it ſuffers a Genericall
change.</p>
                     <p>7. For, ſince the diviſibility of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements
is, preciſely, into the parts of a
Magnitude; out of that diviſion, by the
courſe of nature, a variation in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
muſt neceſſarily follow.</p>
                     <p>8. As alſo, ſince the compoſition of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
clearly aym's, by a certain Way, at
a certain End; a ſubſtantiall variatio in
them muſt only depend upon the change
of the adequate complexion neceſſary to
the End of the compoſition.</p>
                     <p>9. Laſtly, <hi>Mixtums;</hi> ſince their notion
is conſtituted betwixt both theſe; as 'tis
aggregated of ſimilary parts and has a
conformity with the Elements, ſo far, it
follows, they muſt be ſubject to their
way of change; but, as 'tis compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of diſſimilar parts, yet cohering
in Proportion not Order, ſo far 'tis
chang'd by the change of the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115975:124"/>
without any reſpect to the Order.</p>
                     <p>10. You'l object; Since every Accident
concurs to the deſignation of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
upon any Accident's being chang'd,
the ultimate ſubſtantiall difference muſt
be altered: eſpecially, ſince a Subſtance is
defin'd to be nothing but A certain <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultance</hi>
from Accidents.</p>
                     <p>11. 'Tis anſwer'd, that, as, 'tis evident,
Plurality is, ſo, nothing elſe but diviſion
<hi>ended,</hi> as, notwithſtanding, not every part
of the diviſion changes Unity, but only the
Figure: ſo, it happens in Rarefaction,
that 'tis indeed the production of a new
Element, when 'tis <hi>perfected;</hi> yet, every
part of rarefaction does not partially
change the Subſtance of an Element.</p>
                     <p>12. Now, rarefaction and condenſation
is <hi>perfected,</hi> when 'tis become ſuch, that
the former degree cannot be reſtor'd to
the Thing that's rarifi'd or condens'd, out
of the preciſe nature of Common cauſes;
but ther's need of a ſpeciall cauſe for this
effect: for, 'tis plain, that, otherwiſe, it is
not, in reſpect of the world, a new Thing
or part; ſince, by the very common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the world, 'twill return to its
former nature.</p>
                     <p>13. Much more, in the deſtruction of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115975:124"/>
an Animal, every alteration is, ſo, a way to
its deſtruction, as, notwithſtanding, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part does not partially change the very
Subſtance of the Animal.</p>
                     <p>14. Hence, 'tis collected, how ther's
made an <hi>Augmentation</hi> of the ſame numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Animal, through the whole courſe of
its life; and how, many of its members
being cut off, the ſame ſtill numericall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
remains: For, it being ſaid, that the
Subſtantiall notion of an Animal is to be
rated from its <hi>prime Paſsion,</hi> and that That
is the <hi>Love of Food,</hi> that is, of preſerving it
ſelf; moreover, that an Animal being
once made, the identity is not chang'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the quality of its firſt operation be
chang'd, according to the order of nature;
it follows, that an Animal is not chang'd
ſubſtantially, as long as the love of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it ſelf remains in it.</p>
                     <p>15. But, the cutting off of members,
clearly, does not take away this diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and, the change which is made by the
digeſting Food into it ſelf is mean't to
continue the Animal: 'tis clear, therefore,
neither of theſe deſtroy the bounds of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which, we have ſaid, are the <hi>Ends</hi> and
determiners of Subſtance; &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the nature of Individuation remains
firm.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="224" facs="tcp:115975:125"/>
16. Now, why an Animal, remaining the
ſame in Subſtance, ſhould not be rarefi'd
although more quantity come to it: the
reaſon is plain; becauſe, the Subſtance of
an Animal is, of it ſelf, indifferent to many
Magnitudes, that is, to be leſſe and bigger,
and that which it receives is deriv'd to it
by the deſtruction of other bodies; ſo
that <hi>materia prima</hi> (which is a capacity of
quantity) has that compariſon to the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
Animal, that is, is a Capacity of as
much quantity in the Animal, as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in many Things: whence, it comes
to paſſe, that in the Animal, the quantity
and ſubſtance retain the ſame proportion
to the <hi>Standard</hi> or univerſall ſubſtance,
which before they had to it in the Animal
and its food.</p>
                     <p>17. It appears, again, out of what has
been ſaid, how the <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> may be ſaid
to have more in it then the <hi>Nature;</hi> though
theſe are, indeed, one and the very ſame
thing: For, the <hi>Nature</hi> ſpeaks the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
of Accidents, preciſely as 'tis a
<hi>complexion;</hi> and ſo makes an Inſtrument
of the operation intended by nature: and
the notion of this is one and determind;
and ther's nothing in it but eſſentially and
formally.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:115975:125"/>
18. But, the <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> is the thing
which the Nature conſtitutes: whence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſo explicates the nature, as that,
beſides, it includes confuſedly other noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
as alſo, becauſe the nature is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
of many, the natures of every one
muſt needs be conjoyn'd with this Nature
or Subſtance: it comes to paſſe, that all
the Accidents, according to their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
natures, are in the <hi>Suppoſitum;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
that there is more in the <hi>Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum,</hi>
then in the <hi>Nature.</hi>

                     <p>1. IT appears, farther, that, ſince an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
is governd by Paſſion; and
Paſſion riſes from goods or ills to
Nature, that is, thoſe things which are
conformable or diſſonant to nature: <hi>Man,</hi>
if he be applyable to all things, that is,
prompt to embrace any ill of nature, or
fly any good; muſt of neceſſity have ſuch
a faculty in him, that, in his Brain, ills of
nature greater then any ſuch good may
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115975:126"/>
be joyn'd to the good which he is to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chue,
and likewiſe greater goods to the ill

applyer, be impell'd to his deſtin'd acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>2. Theſe goods, therefore, with ills,
and contrariwiſe, ſince they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
in the things themſelves, and yet
muſt appear to him conjoyn'd, and this
not by miſtake but by the deſign of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
'tis plain, there is in the Man a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
whereby it may appear to him that
thoſe goods are conjoyn'd with the ills,
and that he from that <hi>appearance</hi> is mov'd;
and not becauſe the appearances are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
conjoyn'd (as, peradventure, 'tis in
Beaſts), which, not having any conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from a conjunction of the objects in
nature, (as, <hi>future</hi> or <hi>paſt</hi> things), cannot
from ſuch conjunction, that is, by force
of nature, have a power of moving through
conjunction.</p>
                     <p>3. And, ſince this conjunction moves
a man, not as being a <hi>manner</hi> of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of things, but becauſe 'tis the <hi>thing</hi>
known; the other conditions, too, of
Things and chiefly their very Exiſtence
muſt be, ſo, in a man and, ſo, move him:
The objects, therefore, as exiſting, that is,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115975:126"/>
Exiſtence as <hi>Exiſtence</hi> muſt be known by a
man.</p>
                     <p>4. And, becauſe exiſtence, by its own
Form and its very being exiſtence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
non-exiſtence; he that knows a
thing exiſts knows that it does not not-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt,
or (which is as much) that what exiſts,
whilſt it does ſo, cannot not-exiſt. Man,
therefore, has a foundation whereby he
may be certify'd of all Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>The
ſame cannot be and not-be, at once.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. Since, therefore, then we are judg'd

to be call'd an <hi>Vnderſtanding Creature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. Again, ſince our knowledge riſes
from our Senſes, &amp; our Senſes, ſometimes,
are ſo imperfectly mov'd by the Objects,
that, though we perceive ther's ſomething,
yet we know not its quality, (for example,
we ſee a body, which we know not whether
it be alive or dead; or, we diſcern it moves
it ſelf, but doubt what kind of Animal
'tis): 'tis evident, we know ſome one thing,
of more like to one another which we are
acquainted with, to be, without diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the individuality, that is, we have an
univerſall notion which is indifferent to

                        <pb n="228" facs="tcp:115975:127"/>

this farther Conſideration, that 'Tis the

whereof he was not certain, but is
rendred certain by the very derivation.</p>
                     <p>8. And becauſe, of thoſe things which
are unknown, either part is indifferent to
the Underſtanding, and the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

follows, that a Man, by this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determin'd,</hi>
is rendred <hi>determin'd;</hi> and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                     <p>9. Again, ſince, 'tis clear, that one part
of a Man is affected from another part, as
from a ſenſible object; for example, One
hand Feels the other or whatever other
exteriour part of the Body; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
we are ſenſible of our ſelves by Smell,
Hearing, and Sight: it follows, that a Man
can think and diſcourſe of himſelf and,
conſequently, of his actions; and, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
that he can determine himſelf to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115975:127"/>
act or not-act, the underſtanding deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by diſcourſe to the good or illneſſe
of the action he is about to doe.</p>
                     <p>10. A Man, therefore, moves himſelf
to act and is Maſter of his action, and, out
of the notion of good and ill, differently
diſpoſes his action; which we uſe to call
being <hi>Free:</hi> a Man, therefore, is <hi>Free.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. You'l object, that <hi>liberty,</hi> according
to the common notion of men, conſiſts in
this, that, Suppoſing all things requiſite
for action, yet a Man can, out of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall
faculty, immediately will to act
or not-act. 'Tis anſwer'd, This is not the
notion of the vulgar; which holds <hi>to act
and not-act</hi> for the notion of <hi>liberty,</hi> without
that addition of <hi>ſuppoſing all things requiſite
beſides the action it ſelf:</hi> nor is it the notion
of the Learned, that have ſought in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it ſelf, how the notion of the vulgar
ſhould be explicated.</p>
                     <p>12. But 'tis an errour in <hi>Metaphyſick,</hi> in
as much as it ſuppoſes an indifferent, as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi>
to act; and that to be in Effect
which never was in Cauſe, that is, an effect
to be without a cauſe.</p>
                     <p>13. Again, 'tis erroneous in <hi>Morall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi>
for the Notion of <hi>Vertue</hi> would be
taken away; whoſe nature 'tis to incline
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115975:128"/>
to <hi>will actually,</hi> ſo that, a more vertuous
perſon is more determin'd to will juſt
things then a leſſe vertuous.</p>
                     <p>14. <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> too, and <hi>Negotiation</hi>
would be taken away: for, if the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the will ſhould proceed not out
of the preceding cauſes, in vain would
be the endeavours of drawing men to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
one thing more then another.</p>
                     <p>15. Out of what has been ſaid, it may
be determin'd, that Man, by force of his
Intellective vertue, conſider'd in it ſelf, is
capable of infinite Science: For, ſince,
whatever is added is ſtill a degree and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
in the Man to farther Science 'tis
apparent, the underſtanding is not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd
but rendred more capable by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Science: Wherefore, ſince Science, for
its part, may, by addition, encreaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
end, and is only reſtrain'd by uninfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſſe
of the number of the Objects, it
muſt needs be that Man is capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
all, that is, infinite Science, <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>
and <hi>at once;</hi> that is, he is of a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
abſolutely infinite, in reſpect of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
comprehending infinite of them, as
a <hi>Superficies</hi> comprehends infinite <hi>Lines,</hi>
and a <hi>Line</hi> infinite <hi>Points.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. Again, ſince, among knowable
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115975:128"/>
things, thoſe are contain'd, too, which are
to be done by a Man; to this, alſo, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Science extends, even to know what's
to be done. And, ſince Science is an active
Principle, a Man, by Science, will be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to <hi>direct</hi> his actions; that is, to <hi>govern</hi>
his <hi>life;</hi> and this moſt <hi>perfectly,</hi> becauſe he
is enabled to know what's <hi>beſt</hi> to be done.</p>

or, of the MIND.</head>
                     <p>1. OUt of what has been hitherto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated,
'tis eaſily deduc'd that
Man, according to this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is rais'd above the notions of Matter
and Quantity. For, ſince Matter is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
capacity of Quantity, Quantity of
Figure, Figure is determin'd by Place, and
all theſe in Time: but, 'tis clear, that the
intention and thought of Man, in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
conception, is entertained about
ſomething indifferent to infinite Figures,
Places, Times, and Magnitudes; and this,
not out of the nature of the thing, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis in the <hi>Mind</hi> of Man: 'Tis moſt
evident that the <hi>Mind</hi> is ſomething of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind then Matter and Quantity; and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115975:129"/>
conſequently, nobler, ſince 'tis an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the perfecteſt bodies.</p>
                     <p>2. Again, ſince Thing and Exiſtence is
that which firſt and primely fixes the
Mind, and to which it ſeems to be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
capacity: but Thing (out of what has
been ſaid) abſtracts from and
is before great and little,<note place="margin">Leſ. 7. n. 11. 16.</note> both
in rarefy'd and augmented
things: it follows, that the notion of the
Mind is before and nobler then Quantity
and, its com-part, Matter.</p>
                     <p>3. Again, ſince all the negotiation of
our Mind reduces diviſibles to indiviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
as appears in Numbers, Figures,
Points, Lines, Superficies, Inſtants, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons,
Denominations, Relations, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but, nothing is ſo different as
an indiviſible from a diviſible: 'tis clear,
on all ſides, that the nature of the Mind is
wholy oppoſite to the nature of Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and Quantity implying a kind of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinateneſſe
and confuſion, that the
Mind is ſtill the nobler part.</p>
                     <p>4. Nor, with leſſe evidence, is it prov'd
that the Mind is a Subſtantiall principle
of Man: For, ſince his operations are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
indiviſible; but, what is receiv'd
in a diviſible, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> becomes diviſible
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:115975:129"/>
upon the diviſion of the ſubject; 'tis clear,
his operations are not receiv'd in a Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and, conſequently, that his Mind is
an indiviſible Subſtance.</p>
                     <p>5. Again, if the Subſtance of Man be
wholy materiall and diviſible, his Mind it
ſelf and all its affections can be nothing
but certain <hi>Manners</hi> and determinations
of diviſibility (as, 'tis plain, of the other
qualities which are acceſſory to bodies):
but, 'tis plain, out of what has been ſaid,
that 'tis no ſuch thing: wherefore, neither
that the whole Subſtance of Man is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall,
but, in part, Spirituall and indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>6. 'Tis clear, too, that the Mind is not
another, but the ſame Subſtance with the
Man: For, ſince an <hi>Inſtrument to all things</hi>
includes the being an Inſtrument to ſome;
wherein conſiſts the notion of an <hi>Animal:</hi>
'tis clear, that a <hi>Man</hi> is a certain <hi>Species</hi> of
<hi>Animal;</hi> and conſequently, that his Mind,
by which he is a Man, is formally one and
the ſame Thing with the reſt of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Man.</p>
                     <p>7. And indeed, were it ſuppos'd a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Thing from the Subſtance of the
Man, it would not ſuffer from the body,
nor could it acquire any thing through its
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115975:130"/>
conjunction to the body, nor be at all
conjoyned to it: for, it muſt be either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titatively,
and this cannot be otherwiſe
then by unity of Subſtance, for a <hi>Thing</hi>
ſpeaks <hi>Subſtance;</hi> or, ſome other acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
way, whereof ther's nothing common
to a body and a Spirit.</p>
                     <p>8. You'l ſay, Since a Spirit is a Thing
of another order then a body, how can it
concurre into the ſame Thing? then, how
will it be cemented? and, what neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of one to the other? 'Tis anſwered,
that, as, in a Magnitude, one part is faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to another, and has the <hi>power</hi> of a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſter</hi>
without diviſion, that is, the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of a ſever'd Thing without ſeparation:
ſo, the Soul alſo, may be the <hi>ſame</hi> with the
body, without confuſion of properties.</p>
                     <p>9. And, becauſe, in a corporeall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ther's admitted a certain negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indiviſible vertue <hi>antecedent</hi> to diviſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>viz.</hi> a not-yet diviſibility of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
before the <hi>Quantity:</hi> ſuch as is the
connexion and gradation from the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to the negative indiviſibility; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like that will be apt to unite, without
a <hi>Paradox,</hi> the <hi>Mind</hi> poſitively indiviſible,
to the Subſtance negatively indiviſible.</p>
                     <p>10. And, how will it unite? but, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115975:130"/>
to thoſe parts, in which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
primarily and principally reſides:
which, as 'tis <hi>principally</hi> in the Heart, that
being a certain Fountain of the whole
Thing; ſo, <hi>ſpecially,</hi> as to the notion of
<hi>Animality,</hi> 'tis in the Brain, whence Senſe
and Motion is deriv'd to the whole Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
which are thoſe operations from
which 'tis denominated an Animal.</p>
                     <p>11. Since, therefore, the other actions,
which do not affect the Heart nor the
Brain, ſtrike not home to the inmoſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
ſo, neither do they reach Mentall
Knowledge or the integrity of the Soul:
but, the changes that ſtrike upon theſe
Principles affect the Soul, too; and, it
comes to paſſe that <hi>not-the-ſame</hi> ordination
of bodily parts, eſpecially of the Spirits
and Heart, follows in <hi>Man</hi> from the Brain's
being affected, which would follow in <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Animal;</hi> but one, from the <hi>propriety</hi>
of the affected Subſtance, conformable to

                     </p>
                     <p>12. But, any other unity, then that the
Soul ſhould intimely be comprehended
in the definition of <hi>Man,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſhould conſiſt of the ſame notion and

that Man, as to his Soul,
ſuffers from Corporeall Agents:
For, ſince the Soul it ſelf is a certain Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

which is introduc'd and expell'd
by corporeall actions; 'tis clear, that
thoſe actions, which reach to the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
muſt, of neceſſity, affect and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in it, after its manner.</p>
                     <p>2. Conſequently, it acquires Science:
For, ſince, 'tis nothing but a certain <hi>Poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
to <hi>Science,</hi> as to its <hi>perfection;</hi> 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
that all its change is towards Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>be</hi> ſome kind of <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
either perfect or imperfect.</p>
                     <p>3. Whence, even they, that deny the
Soul acquires Science, ſay that 'tis excited
and admoniſh't by the preſence of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
but, to be excited and admoniſh't is
to receive knowledge: the Soul, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
acquires knowledge from the Body.</p>

                        <pb n="237" facs="tcp:115975:131"/>
4. Nor makes againſt this <hi>Socrates</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
of a Boy, orderly ask'd and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
right to Geometricall propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
for, this queſtioning was a producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Science, not a renovation; for 'twas
an application of the notion of the ſame
Being, which is between the Terms, to the
underſtanding of the Boy; whereby it
came to paſſe that the Truth to be known
was by the notion of Thing, knit to the
Soul of the Boy, and made, as it were, a
part of it, in which the vertue of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Science conſiſts.</p>
                     <p>5. Yet, the Soul has not, by this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
a power to move the body: For, we
ſee, Science is often overcome by Paſſion;
but, if it had any <hi>proper</hi> activity, it could
not be reſiſted by any power of its <hi>own</hi>
body: Moreover, it would no longer be
<hi>a part</hi> of a Man, but ſomething <hi>grafted</hi> in
him of a ſuperiour nature, according to
that vertue.</p>
                     <p>6. It follows, therefore, that, by vertue
of the Soul, <hi>more</hi> motives of <hi>goods</hi> or <hi>ills</hi> are
<hi>conjoynd</hi> to the <hi>ſingular</hi> objects; by whoſe
conjunction the <hi>Heart</hi> and the <hi>body</hi> is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
otherwiſe to <hi>thoſe</hi> goods or ills, then it
would be <hi>had they not</hi> that conjunction: So
that, the force of <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115975:132"/>
which moves a Man, even then when he
ſeems to follow the firmeſt <hi>Reaſon;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe to be <hi>Reaſonable</hi> to <hi>follow</hi> this
and to <hi>fly</hi> that, is nothing elſe but that
<hi>more</hi> of <hi>delightfull</hi> is <hi>conjoynd</hi> with this and
<hi>more</hi> of <hi>painfull</hi> with that.</p>
                     <p>7. In vertue of theſe, therefore, a Man
is chang'd, and acts <hi>otherwiſe</hi> then if he had
not underſtanding. Nor, is he carry'd,
from the <hi>very beginning,</hi> by <hi>reaſon</hi> or any
<hi>proper</hi> power, to this connection of goods
with ills; but is <hi>prevented</hi> by ſome chance
or obvious diſpoſition of objects &amp; corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall
cauſes, either <hi>intrinſecall</hi> or <hi>extrinſecall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. Now, this diſpoſition in the Soul,
upon which <hi>Operation</hi> follows, we call the
WILL, and the firſt beginning <hi>Volition;</hi>
which, 'tis apparent, is left by <hi>precedent
judgements,</hi> chiefly thoſe that are about
good or ill, ſince, by ſuch judgements, 'tis
plain, a Man is determin'd to action.</p>
                     <p>9. Hence, it appears, how the Soul fails
in <hi>Opining:</hi> For, ſeeing Objects occurre
to the Soul, not deduc'd and drawn-in, by
its own force and nerves, as it were, but,
by the agitation of bodies; if the <hi>affection</hi>
to any thing ſo <hi>preſſes</hi> a Man to action,
that it leaves not room for the objects to
run in <hi>that order</hi> which is neceſſary for <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration;</hi>
                        <pb n="239" facs="tcp:115975:132"/>
the Man muſt needs fall to
acting, before he has any abſolute <hi>evidence</hi>
what's to be done.</p>
                     <p>10. If this be done by <hi>reflection,</hi> a Man
ſee's that he's mov'd uncertainly; but, he
ſee's, too, that nature requires he ſhould
move upon <hi>apparences;</hi> whence, he does
no unbeſeeming incongruous thing: But,
if it be done without reflection, a Man
takes an uncertainfor a certain; which is, to
<hi>Opine;</hi> for he ſays, <hi>this is,</hi> which he has no
<hi>determinate</hi> cauſe to ſay.</p>
                     <p>11. From this <hi>precipitation</hi> of action, it
happens, that one Man operates <hi>better,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>worſe;</hi> according as one, more <hi>frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
or more <hi>grievouſly,</hi> precipitates his action,
then another. And, thoſe that come neareſt
to evidence, as far as nature will bear, doe
the <hi>uttermoſt of their power;</hi> which is to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>vertuouſly:</hi> but, thoſe that very much
recede from it, are call'd <hi>vitious:</hi> between
which, a certain middle ſtate of Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
<hi>notoriouſly</hi> to neither part.</p>
                     <p>12. 'Tis clear, therefore, whence the
defectibility of <hi>Vice</hi> riſes in Man-kind: to
wit, becauſe, by too much <hi>precipitation</hi>
of <hi>bodily motion, falſe</hi> or the <hi>worſe</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are generated. Whence, it follows,
that man is not only changeable from
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115975:133"/>
imperfect to perfect, but alſo from good
to evil, and contrariwiſe: For, if he has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin'd
a falſity, upon farther light, he may
be led to the Truth, and if, invited by
apparences, he has follow'd the Truth, by
others he may be averted again.</p>
                     <p>13. Whence, 'tis evident, ther's ſome
oppoſition in the Soul, that is, ſome acts
incompoſsible <hi>at once</hi> in it: for, ſince thoſe
things which are in the Soul inhere in it, in
vertue of Being; 'tis plain, it muſt be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd,
out of the very notion of Being,
what things conſiſt <hi>together</hi> in the Soul and
what not. Now, 'tis clear, that 'tis againſt
the notion of Being, that the ſame ſhould
Be and not-Be: but, of thoſe things that
<hi>are,</hi> all agree in the notion of Being, nor
does any thing hinder that <hi>white</hi> and <hi>black,
light</hi> and <hi>darkneſſe, hot</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> ſhould co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſt;
wherefore, neither does any thing
forbid their being <hi>together</hi> in the Soul:
but, for the ſame to Be and not-Be, which
is, to be <hi>affirm'd</hi> and <hi>deny'd,</hi> 'tis wholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant.</p>
                     <p>14. Since, therefore, Man ſuffers no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy
in himſelf to have whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things <hi>together</hi> in his Mind; it comes
to paſſe, that he is capable and cognoſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of all Things: He can, therefore,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115975:133"/>
know what's <hi>beſt</hi> for himſelf, or, in what
State he may <hi>moſt perfectly</hi> enjoy himſelf:
Nor, will he doubt that he is to ſtrain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
this by all his actions; wherefore,
he will be govern'd againſt nature, if he be
employ'd otherwiſe then is convenient to
attain <hi>This laſt End.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. Whether, therefore, one Man
rules another, or whether ſome ſuperiour
Power governs him; he govern'd againſt
nature, if he withdraw him from <hi>This
chiefeſt Good:</hi> And becauſe Nature is the
Principle of acting; a Man, as far as he is
able, will reduce himſelf to a rectitude
and ſtraight courſe towards his ULTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MATE
GOOD, and will reſiſt all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
operation.</p>
                     <p>16. Though Man, therefore, be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
fram'd to be mov'd <hi>by another,</hi>
as all other Animals: yet, 'twill be with
this difference, that other Animals are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
to be mov'd to the End of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
without any reſpect to their <hi>proper</hi>
good; but, Man is govern'd to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's
End, no farther then as the ſame
is a Motion towards the <hi>proper Good</hi> of
Man.</p>
                     <p>17. MAN, therefore, is an <hi>Inſtrument,</hi>
fram'd by nature apt for <hi>univerſality of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:115975:134"/>

Body.</head>
                     <p>1.<seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ut of what has been ſaid, 'tis
evident, that a <hi>Humane Soul</hi>
periſhes not at the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its <hi>Body:</hi> For, ſince,
whilſt it exiſts in the Body, it has <hi>imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>
acts which cannot belong to a Body;
it muſt of neceſſity have, of its proper
ſelf, the vertue of a <hi>Thing,</hi> or, of receiving
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115975:135"/>
Exiſtence: Since, therefore, ther's nothing
farther requir'd to exiſt, in a thing alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
exiſting, but the having in it ſelf a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of ſuſtaining exiſtence; and, 'tis plain,
that, the body being taken away, this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is not withdrawn, (ſince 'tis in the Soul,
apart from and beſides the Body); 'tis
evident that, by the diſſolution of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
the Soul is not diſſolv'd.</p>
                     <p>2. Adde to this, that, ſince there is no
other ſubſtantiall diviſibility, but of Form
and Matter; and <hi>Matter</hi> is not neceſſary
to the Souls exiſtence; ther's no diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in the Subject of exiſtence, as exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
is in the <hi>Soul,</hi> by means whereof the
Soul can be alienated from Being.</p>
                     <p>3. We ſee, too, that all mortality of
Bodies either proceeds from contrariety,
or from the diviſibility of a quantitative
Subject; whereof, ſince neither is to be
found in the Soul ſeparated, 'tis plain, that
'Tis not ſubject to corruption.</p>
                     <p>4. You'l object, if the Soul in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is capable of exiſtence, 'tis capable of
action or of a Motive power; as quantita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
parts, though they have a common
exiſtence, yet act upon one another. 'Tis
anſwer'd, quantitative parts are acceſſory
to and find the Subſtance already perfect:
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115975:135"/>
but formall parts (at leaſt eſſentiall ones)
do not preſuppoſe the Subſtance eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht;
whence, the active power follows
not any one, but all.</p>
                     <p>5. You'l ſay, that Exiſtence, too, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
all the parts of a Thing, as 'tis a
<hi>Thing:</hi> wherefore, neither will the Soul
be capable of exiſtence in the Body. 'Tis
anſwer'd, that action belongs to the Soul
in the Body as exiſtence does: For, exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
makes not the Soul, while 'tis in the
Body, to be a Thing; for that's primely
of the whole, and the whole Man <hi>is</hi> the
Thing; but it makes the Soul to be That
which <hi>may be</hi> a Thing: So, alſo, 'tis not
abſolutely a principle of acting, but 'tis a
principle by which action becomes other
then 'twould be without it; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
it has a Being, whence action
<hi>may be,</hi> but not whence <hi>'tis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. It appears, again, that the Soul ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
is not, truly, the <hi>ſame Thing</hi> with the
Soul in the Body; but is ſubſtantially
chang'd. For, firſt 'twas joyn'd ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to the Body and was one with it: but,
'tis clear, that when, by diviſion, more
things are made of one, the Thing divided
is chang'd; eſpecially when the Unity it
ſelf was ſubſtantiall, as in the preſent caſe;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115975:136"/>
ſince the Soul adheres to the corporeall
Subſtance, not by quantity, but by <hi>identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. Again, the Soul, now ſeparated, is
the immediate and <hi>adequate</hi> Subject of its
own exiſtence: whereas, in the body, the
Man himſelf was the Thing, and the Soul
only a part of the Thing, or, <hi>whereby</hi> the
Thing was. Yet, 'tis the <hi>ſame</hi> Thing, as to
its notion and definition; ſince it conſiſts
of thoſe <hi>predicates</hi> it had in the Body.</p>
                     <p>8. You'l object, In the Body, it had not
a power of receiving exiſtence in it ſelf;
therefore, neither will it have out of the
Body: for a part and a Thing are of an
intirely different kind, and vaſtly diſtinct
from one another. 'Tis anſwer'd, that, as,
in the parts of a Magnitude, 'tis manifeſt,
that they are neither Things, nor only
parts of a Thing; but ſomething between,
which is ſo a part, that it may be ſome
kind of whole: So, it repugns not, that
there ſhould be ſomething in formall
parts which is, <hi>de facto,</hi> a part, and yet <hi>may
be</hi> a whole; and that ſhould be a kind of
Middle thing, which has enough in it ſelf
to become a whole, yet ſhould not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
be a whole: Whence, when the Soul
is ſeparated, there is not any thing added
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115975:136"/>
to it, to make it more capable of exiſtence,
but that is withdrawn from it, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
it from exiſting.</p>
                     <p>9. Now, he that deſires to frame to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
in ſome ſort, a notion of a ſeparated
Soul; let him ponder with himſelf that
object which correſponds to the words
<hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Animal,</hi> as ſuch: which when he
ſhall ſee, abſtracts from Place and
Time, and is a Subſtance by the only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of the <hi>Terms;</hi> let him conceive the
like of a ſeparated Soul.</p>
                     <p>10. Then, let him attentively conſider
ſome ſelf-evident and moſt naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:
in which, when he ſhall have
contemplated that the object is in the
Soul with its proper exiſtence and, as it
were, by it; let him think a ſeparated
Soul is a Subſtance that <hi>is</hi> all other things,
by the very connexion of Exiſtences.</p>
                     <p>11. Laſtly, when, in Bodies, he ſhall
obſerve that Motion proceeds from the
quality of the Mover &amp; a certain impulſe;
and that this impulſe is deriv'd again from
another impulſe, and ſo up even to that
which is firſt mov'd, and beyond: let him
imagine the Soul is a kind of principle of
ſuch impulſe; whatſoever thing that muſt
be.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="248" facs="tcp:115975:137"/>
12. What is ſaid of the Subſtance of the
Soul, undoubtedly muſt be underſtood,
too, of its proper Accidents; for, ſince
they depend only upon it, (being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it, nay even the very Soul), and
it would be more imperfect without them;
they muſt run the ſame fortune with it,
unleſſe ſome ſpeciall reaſon interpoſe.</p>
                     <p>13. Whatever things, therefore, were
in the Man, according to his Soul, at the
inſtant of his Death, remain in the Soul
after ſeparation: wherefore, all his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
or Iudgements, whether ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
or practicall, ſhall remain in it; where,
ſince they cannot be without Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
even they, too, ſhall remain: And,
ſince all things, which are made to follow
out of or have connexion with theſe, are
in a ſeparated Soul, in vertue of theſe, its
Science muſt needs be extended to all
thoſe; all <hi>ſuch,</hi> therefore, which have once
been in it and are not blotted out, after
death all remain.</p>
                     <p>14. Since, therefore, in a Soul ther's an
infinite capacity; and ther's no oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of apprehenſions among themſelves,
nor any other oppoſition, but of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
whereby the ſame is affirm'd to <hi>be</hi>
and <hi>not-be:</hi> all the apprehenſions, ſcrap'd
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115975:137"/>
up together in the whole life, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
unretracted muſt, of neceſſity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
unleſſe ſome ſpeciall Cauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
                     <p>15. The whole Notion, therefore, of
the paſt life, all the particular acquaintan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Familiars and other <hi>Individuums,</hi> all
Sciences and Arts, attain'd in the life time,
ſurvive after Death.</p>

                     <p>1. BUt, all theſe things being ſo, <hi>now,</hi>
in the Soul, that <hi>time was,</hi> they
were not; 'tis plain, they are <hi>ſo</hi>
conjoyn'd to it, that ther's <hi>no repugnancy</hi> it

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d from it:
ſome kind of diviſibility, then, there is
between the Soul and the things in it.</p>
                     <p>2. Not that which is between the parts
of a Magnitude; ſince, here's an indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
on both ſides, whereas a Magnitude
is not made up of indiviſibles. Nor, that
which is between Matter and Form; ſince
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115975:138"/>
the Soul, which <hi>is</hi> before, is able to preex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt
of it ſelf; and whatever things come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it ſupervene to a Thing already exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Nor that which is between Subſtance
and Quantity; ſince Quantity is in a
Thing, as ſomewhat <hi>of it;</hi> but things
known are in the Knower as <hi>other</hi> things
which preexiſt <hi>out of</hi> him.</p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis, therefore, a ſpeciall manner of
diviſibility which is not exactly found in
bodies: For, ſince a body eſſentially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
a <hi>power</hi> or poſſibility, the unity of
a body is by the <hi>privation</hi> of act on one ſide;
whence follows the unity of act in the
Compound: But, a ſeparated Soul is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
only of Act or Quiddity, as <hi>white</hi> or
<hi>hot,</hi> and Exiſtence or Being, as when we
ſay, <hi>'tis:</hi> whence, its unity to another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
exiſting muſt be, ſo, as an act can
be joyn'd to an act, that is, by <hi>identification</hi>
or a community of Being: and, after this
manner, are in a ſeparated Soul whatever
are in it.</p>
                     <p>4. Whence, firſt, this is evident, that a
ſeparated Soul knows it ſelf: For, ſince,
to be in another, by way of <hi>knowing,</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh't,
in this, from the other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of inexiſting; that, in <hi>others,</hi> what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſts
is now no Thing in it ſelf, but that's
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115975:138"/>
in which it is; things <hi>know'n,</hi> by inexiſting,
loſe not the being what they were, though
they acquire the being of that which they
were not: for, <hi>Heat,</hi> in that which is <hi>hot,</hi> is
ſomething of the <hi>Subject,</hi> nor has any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Being of its own; but, the <hi>hot Subject</hi>
which is <hi>felt</hi> is, ſo, in him that's ſenſible of
it, that he knows <hi>'tis hot;</hi> therefore, <hi>this
Subject to be actually hot</hi> is in the perſon
that's ſenſible of it.</p>
                     <p>5. In like manner, the <hi>Soul</hi> exiſts ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially,
becauſe Being is made ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Soul. Again, this, that <hi>the
Soul is,</hi> is in the Soul: for, ſince the Soul
is a certain Power of being all things that
exiſt; and it ſelf alſo exiſts; it cannot but,
by reaſon of its intimate conjunction, be
preſent to it ſelf according to this its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which is that it cannot but be <hi>underſtood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. Again, ſince all thoſe things are in
the Soul which we have, above, recounted;
they muſt needs be, too, all <hi>known</hi> in the
Soul: And, becauſe, 'tis clear, that, in a
Syllogiſm, the Concluſion is nothing but
the very Premiſſes; all is known by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
Soul, which is <hi>deducible</hi> out of thoſe
things that are in the Soul.</p>
                     <p>7. And, becauſe, ſuch is the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Truths,</hi> that, out of any one, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115975:139"/>
may, by links, be drawn in; it comes
to paſſe that a Soul, which knows <hi>any</hi>
whatever ſenſible Truth, knows intirely all
cognoſcible things; that is, every Soul
penetrates abſolutely all things.</p>
                     <p>8. For, if any Infant never knew its
own Being, it is not to be eſteem'd to have
arriv'd at all to the nature of Man: For,
ſince, even in us, to be <hi>ſenſible</hi> of or to <hi>know</hi>
is by <hi>ſuffering</hi> from another; we know an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
thing <hi>is,</hi> becauſe we know we have
<hi>ſuffered</hi> from it: but, if we know we have
ſuffered from it, we already know <hi>we are:</hi>
the firſt knowledge, therefore, even in
the body, includes the knowledge of <hi>our
ſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. And, ſince Paſſion is a <hi>participation</hi>
of the Thing from which we ſuffer; it
muſt needs be that the Thing <hi>is</hi> in us, when
we are ſenſible of it: and, becauſe it does
not denominate according to its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
appellation, but according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of that wherein it is, (for, we do not
call an Eye <hi>white</hi> or <hi>wooden,</hi> but a <hi>Seeer</hi> of
white or wood); it muſt needs be that 'tis
in it, <hi>as another thing,</hi> and as of the nature
of the ſenſitive Subject. Now, the reaſon
why in the body, too, the Soul does not
know it ſelf, but <hi>the Man,</hi> a part of whom it
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115975:139"/>
is, is becauſe 'tis <hi>he</hi> that <hi>is</hi> and not <hi>it,</hi> as has
been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>10. You'l object, this multiplicity of
knowledge is fram'd or aggregated, either
of <hi>ſeverall</hi> knots and articles, as it were, ſo
that whatever was knowable in this world
by new diſcourſe, the ſame is, in ſome
ſort, a new addition in the Soul; or of
<hi>one ſimple</hi> knowledge which, eminently
and in one formality, in a manner, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
all theſe knowledges: but, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe ſeems poſſible; not the firſt,
becauſe 'twould be a certain infinity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in act, which is impoſſible, or in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and then 'twould be ſome <hi>continuity</hi> and
a principle of continuall motion; nor
the later, for ſuch an univerſality ſeems
not to have any thing above it.</p>
                     <p>11. 'Tis anſwer'd, the manner of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
Soul, in ſome ſort, contains both;
though 'tis neither way formally: For,
ſince, the parts in formall compoſition <hi>are
not</hi> actually; 'tis plain, that neither can
there be, in this compoſition of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of a ſeparated Soul, formall knots
and articles of diſcourſe, &amp; conſequently,
no <hi>actuall</hi> infinity: Again, ſince one part is
not beyond another, that is, extended, as
in quantity, but all, by a certain identifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115975:140"/>
grow together; there can be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity
between, though the parts be in
power, that is, only in the poſſibility of
the Subject.</p>
                     <p>12. Beſides, that this power is not ſuch
that there ſhould be any correſpondent
<hi>naturall cauſe</hi> to reduce it into act: but,
'tis only a certain defectibility of act, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which ther's no active power but only
a Logicall or a Creative one, which will
never act.</p>
                     <p>13. 'Tis, therefore, a certain actuall <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicall</hi>
compoſition, in which there is a
<hi>Logicall</hi> poſſibility that any of theſe later
known things may be away, without hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe that were known before; yet ſo,
that it can never come to paſſe it ſhould
be reduc'd into act: Wherefore, 'tis nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the preciſe contemplation of one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
precontaining infinite; nor yet
any <hi>actuall</hi> infinity, or <hi>naturall</hi> diviſibility.</p>
                     <p>14. But, it may be compar'd to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicall</hi>
compoſition of <hi>degrees;</hi> in
which we ſee <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Bucephalus</hi> ſo agree
with infinite Things or Animals, that it
contracts thence no multiplicity, and yet
we may alwaies frame ſome new apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of them in our Mind.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the eminency of a ſeparated
Souls acts, above thoſe it exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
in the Body.</head>
                     <p>1. OUt of what has been ſaid, it may
be evidenc'd, that ſimple Intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or the inexiſtence of a
thing in the Soul ſerv's, in ſtead of that
<hi>compoſition</hi> which is found, <hi>here,</hi> in our
judgements.</p>
                     <p>2. It appears, alſo, that an actuall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
intuition of Things ſupplſes, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
any need of <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis plain, too, that, with that, ther's
no want of <hi>Memory</hi> or <hi>Remembrance;</hi> ther's
no need of ordering or framing <hi>Idea's;</hi>
and laſtly, whatever the Soul operates, <hi>here,</hi>
by diſtinct acts and in time, <hi>there,</hi> together
and with one only labour, (not ſo much,
is wrought out, as) exiſts.</p>
                     <p>4. Again, whereas, by <hi>reſlexion,</hi> thoſe
things we have, in the body, thought on,
we farther know that we <hi>have</hi> thought on
them; ſo that we can never know the laſt
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115975:141"/>
reflection, though we had infinite: a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Soul, by the ſimple inexiſtence of it
ſelf in it ſelf, neceſſarily ſee's all its know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
without any reflection.</p>
                     <p>5. Again, 'tis plain, that a ſeparated
Soul, in another manner, excells Place
and Time, then in the Body: ſince, in that,
it only <hi>abſtracts</hi> from them, but, out of
that, it <hi>comprehends</hi> them. For, this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
and actuall knowledge places all Place
and all Time within the Soul; ſo that it
can act in every place at once and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(as far as concerns this reſpect), and
provide for all time; wherefore, 'tis, in a
manner, a Maker and Governour of time
and place.</p>
                     <p>6. It appears, moreover, that 'tis active,
out of its very ſelf: for, ſince it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
all things, it needs not <hi>Senſe,</hi> as in
the body, to perceive that infinity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuality;
but it know's, even, to the
utmoſt diviſibility of Magnitude, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
circumſtances are requir'd to action:
It knows, too, what is good for it ſelf;
whence, it, naturally &amp; of it ſelf, has both
power and an actuall will, which alone are
requir'd to act; for power depends on pure
Science, and whoever is <hi>impotent</hi> is <hi>ignorant</hi>
what is to be done, by him, to produce

7. Hence, laſtly, it follows, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Grief,</hi> out of the
body, is infinite, to that in the body: For,
ſince <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is nothing elſe, but a <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
concerning a <hi>good poſſeſt,</hi> out of which
follows an activity to <hi>enjoy</hi> and <hi>retain</hi> it;
and <hi>Grief</hi> is the ſame, concerning an <hi>ill,</hi>
which the <hi>Soul</hi> deſires to <hi>repell:</hi> Whether
we contemplate the <hi>Manner</hi> of the Souls
<hi>Being,</hi> to which its acts are proportion'd;
'tis of a ſuperiour notion, that is, of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
eminency.</p>
                     <p>8. Or, the Firmneſſe and <hi>Evidence</hi> of its
<hi>Knowledge;</hi> ſince all knowledge receives
ſtrength from antecedents and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,
it muſt of neceſſity attain an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
excellency: for every knowledge of
a ſeparated Soul has infinite things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
with it, out of which 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd.</p>
                     <p>9. Or, its <hi>Eminency</hi> above <hi>Time</hi> and
<hi>Place;</hi> 'tis rays'd in a like degree: Or,
laſtly, its force of <hi>Activity;</hi> 'tis beyond all
compariſon. Wherefore, to the leaſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Pleaſure</hi> or <hi>Grief,</hi> of the <hi>Future life,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
abſtracting from the <hi>Perpetuity,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be comparable in this <hi>mortall
ſtate,</hi> or conſiderable in reſpect of it.</p>
                     <p>10. Again, 'tis collected, out of what
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115975:142"/>
has been ſaid, that all ſeparated Souls, or,
at leaſt, the moſt part are improv'd in this,
that whatever <hi>falſe</hi> judgements they have
taken up in the whole courſe of their lives,
they throw them off by Separation: For,
ſince, the excellency of a ſeparated Soul is
immenſe above the powers of an imbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy'd
one, &amp; the connection of all Truths
is, immediately upon the Separation, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
in it; it muſt needs be that a <hi>true</hi>
judgement of all things is impreſs'd: ſince,
therefore, Contradictories cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
together in the Soul, the falſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
muſt be expell'd; and Souls, as to
this, be univerſally improv'd.</p>
                     <p>11. Nor, is it leſſe evident that, among
Souls, there will be ſome difference, by
reaſon of the employments they have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
in their life time: For, ſince, whilſt
we live in the body, one exerciſes his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
more about one thing, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
about another; and, as, the firſt act
works a knowledge of the thing, ſo, the
following acts cannot but encreaſe this
knowledge and more perfectly impreſſe it
upon the Soul: It follows, ſince all theſe
muſt needs participate of the elevation
caus'd by the Separation; the Soul muſt
know <hi>more perfectly,</hi> too, in Separation, its
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115975:142"/>
                        <hi>accuſtomed</hi> Objects and whatever depend
on them, in a due <hi>proportion,</hi> then other
things; whence, it comes to paſſe, that
the Sciences here acquir'd, not only, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the future life, but, are in the
<hi>ſame</hi> proportion, there, as they were, here.</p>

                     <p>1. ANd, becauſe the <hi>Affections</hi> in the

upon which operation
does or is apt to follow; and the ſtronger
the judgement is, ſo much the apter ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is to follow out of it, if it be a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning good or ill: it comes to
paſſe, that our Affections to our Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Friends, and the reſt which we
have cultivated in this life, ſhall remain in
the future: wherefore, we ſhall both better
know and more rejoyce in our Parents
and Friends, then in others, (other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
alike).</p>
                     <p>2. And, becauſe the Affections ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
&amp; that, in the proportion they were
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115975:143"/>
in, during life: it follows, that thoſe who
have, in this life, <hi>delighted</hi> in thoſe things &amp;
Sciences, which the Soul is <hi>apt</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> to
enjoy in Separation, (for example, in <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Contemplation,</hi> or that of <hi>abſtracted Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
eſpecially, if with great affection),
will have a vaſt <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in the State of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
through the perfection of the
knowledge they'l enjoy.</p>
                     <p>3. But, thoſe that have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up wholly to <hi>corporeall pleaſures</hi> will
be affected with vaſt <hi>Grief,</hi> through the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
of thoſe pleaſures, there.</p>
                     <p>4. You'l object, that ſeparated Souls
will ſee the unworthineſſe of ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and conſequently, will correct in
themſelves ſuch erroneous and <hi>falſe</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
nor will have <hi>ſuch</hi> appetites as
would torment them. 'Tis anſwer'd, theſe
griefs follow not out of falſe, but <hi>inordinate</hi>
judgements; for, 'tis true, that ſuch like
pleaſures are a good of the body and of
the Man (whoſe appetite is the appetite of
the Soul); again, ſuppoſing the <hi>deordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Soul, 'tis true, that <hi>theſe</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
are conformable and <hi>good,</hi> even to
it: but grief follows, hence, that the
judgements or affections about theſe are
greater, then in <hi>proportion</hi> to thoſe other
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115975:143"/>
deſires, which ought to be <hi>preferr'd</hi> before
them.</p>
                     <p>5. Whence, it comes to paſſe, that the
Soul's ſeeing theſe objects to be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and not regardable, in compariſon of
the better, increaſes its pains; whilſt it
can neither ceaſe to deſire thoſe it deſires,
through the exceſſe of theſe affections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the reſt, and yet ſees they are vile
and unworthy.</p>
                     <p>6. Moreover, out of what has been ſaid,
'tis deduc'd, that, in the ſtate of ſeparation,
no <hi>variety</hi> can happen to Souls, from a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or the change of bodies: For, ſince a
change paſſes not from any body into the
Soul, but through the <hi>identification</hi> of the
Soul with its <hi>own</hi> body; and this identifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
ceaſes, by the ſtate of Separation;
it follows, that no action nor mutation
can be derived from any Body, to the
Soul.</p>
                     <p>7. Nor, has the Soul, of it ſelf, a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of changing it ſelf: not from hence
only, becauſe an Indiviſible cannot act
upon it ſelf: but alſo, becauſe, ſince a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Soul cannot be any other,
then, either according to the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Will; but the Underſtanding is
ſuppos'd to know all things <hi>together</hi> and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115975:144"/>
                        <hi>for-ever,</hi> whence, by the courſe of nature,
ther's no room left either for ignorance
or new Science; and the Will is either not
diſtinct from the Underſtanding or, at
leaſt, is <hi>adequately</hi> govern'd, in the ſtate
of ſeparation: it follows, that <hi>naturally</hi> no
mutation can happen to a ſeparated Soul
from within, or caus'd by it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>8. Nor, yet, from any other Spirit,
without the interpoſition of the body:
For, ſince all Spirits are indiviſible, their
operations, too, will be ſuch; but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible
effect, ſuppoſing all the cauſes, of
neceſſity exiſts in the ſame <hi>inſtant:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if any thing be to be done between
Spirits, 'tis all, in one inſtant, ſo done
and perfected, that, <hi>afterwards,</hi> another
action cannot be begun: for if it begin,
either the cauſes were, before, adequate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put, or not; if they were, the effect
was put; if they were not, ſome of the
cauſes is chang'd that it may now begin
to act, and not this, but the former, is the
firſt mutation, whereof, 'tis to be urg'd,
whether the cauſes were put before?</p>
                     <p>9. If you ſay, the Spirit waits a certain
time: Firſt, time is motion and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a body: Then, ſince, among Spirits,
nothing is chang'd by time, one that acts
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:115975:144"/>
according to reaſon could not expect a
time by which nothing could be chang'd.
Certain, therefore, it is, that <hi>There can be no
change,</hi> by the power of nature <hi>in a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Soul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. From the collection of all has been
ſaid concerning the Soul, 'tis deducible,
that <hi>Our life is a Mould or a March to our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity;</hi>
and, according as a Man behaves
himſelf in this life, ſuch an Eternity he
ſhall, hereafter, poſſeſs: ſince <hi>Good-deeds
and Rewards, Crimes and Punishments are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
eternall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. To conclude, He that has liv'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
ſhall be perfect in the future life,
he that has liv'd better ſhall be better, he
that has liv'd well ſhall be well; he that has
liv'd ill ſhall be ill, he that has liv'd worſe
ſhall be worſe, they that live worſt they,
too, ſhall be worſt of all <hi>for ever:</hi> ſo true
it is that THINGS WILL NOT
BE ILL GOVERN'D, that is, their
very Nature exacts and forces them into a
good Government.</p>

                     <p>1. OUt of what has been ſaid, 'tis
clear, that all bodies and a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Soul it ſelf, ſometimes,
<hi>are</hi> and, time was, they <hi>were not:</hi> whence,
'tis evident, that the notion of Being or
Exiſtence is different from the notion of
that Thing whereof 'tis affirm'd; ſince, 'tis
deny'd, too, of it, and ſince, of all Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that are ſo different, 'tis ſaid, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ſame notion, that <hi>they are.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Beſides, if, for <hi>Peter</hi> or a <hi>Man</hi> not to
<hi>be,</hi> were the ſame, with <hi>Peter</hi> not to be <hi>Peter</hi>
or <hi>a Man</hi> not to be <hi>a Man;</hi> 'twere a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
deſtructive of it ſelf, and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
impoſſible; but now 'tis prudent
and pertinent to Sciences.</p>
                     <p>3. Neither would there any one and the
ſame thing be a Subject of contradictory
enunciations, or of affirmation and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and conſequently, the art of <hi>Logick</hi>
and the foundation of all humane diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
would be taken away: Nothing,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115975:145"/>
therefore, is more evident then that Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
is diſtinguiſht, mentally or by <hi>defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi>
from the Thing whereof 'tis ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                     <p>4. But yet, that it ſhould differ, really,
actually and, as it were, numerically or in
the <hi>Subject,</hi> from the Thing whoſe 'tis, 'tis
equally impoſſible: ſince, ſo, they would
either of them be Things;<note place="margin">B. 4. Leſ. 2.</note>
the whole,<note place="margin">n. 1.</note> therefore, would
not be one and a Thing, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
in the like caſe, is deduc'd.</p>
                     <p>5. Notwithſtanding, ſince a Thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
acquires and loſes exiſtence, (for, to
be made is to receive, to be diſſolv'd is to
loſe exiſtence); 'tis evident, ther's a reall
diviſibility between a Thing and Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</p>
                     <p>6. But, this diviſibility is leſſe then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of thoſe, hitherto, explicated: both
becauſe, in ſeparation, neither part of the
Compound remains; as alſo, becauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
out of a Compound is not intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
ſince 'tis its ultimate actuality or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuation.
And, as 'tis commonly ſaid,
that Union cannot be underſtood out of
Compoſition, nor Action without a Term;
ſo, neither can Being without it actually <hi>be,</hi>
and conſequently, make thoſe things <hi>be</hi>
which are by it.</p>

                        <pb n="266" facs="tcp:115975:146"/>
7. Laſtly, 'tis evident, that exiſtence is
the <hi>perfection</hi> of every and all Things;
ſince, the notion of all Subſtances (as 'tis
explicated above) is nothing
elſe but to be ſuch a capacity
of exiſting:<note place="margin">B. 4. Leſ. 2. n. 1.</note> whence, they have
the notion of a power to <hi>that;</hi> or rather,
the notion of an as-it-were (a <hi>quaſi-)</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility,
ſince they have a vertue termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the underſtanding (that we call to
be a <hi>quiddity)</hi> which a poſſibility has not.</p>
                     <p>8. Notwithſtanding, becauſe this noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is nothing elſe, but a diſpoſition and
preparation to exiſting; Exiſtence is not
only the perfection, but, if it were perfect,
it would be the whole perfection of any
Thing whoſe it were.</p>
                     <p>9. It follows out of what has been ſaid,
that no Thing, of thoſe that ſometime are
ſometime are not, is of it ſelf; but, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſome other thing to make them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt:
For, ſince they are ſometime and
ſometimes are not, 'tis evident, the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in them, which is preſuppos'd to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and whereof 'tis ſaid <hi>it is,</hi> is, of it ſelf,
indifferent to Being and not-Being; and,
which follows, this notion being put, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is not put or the Thing is not, in force
of this notion; and ſomething elſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115975:146"/>
is requir'd, which being put, Being
muſt neceſſarily be apply'd to that notion:
'Tis <hi>from without,</hi> therefore, that theſe
Things exiſt, and not from their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall
nature and force.</p>
                     <p>10. And, becauſe this notion has not its
indifferency from otherwhere, but from it
ſelf; as long as it has Being, ſo long an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall
cauſe muſt make it exiſt: for,
ſince its neceſſity of exiſting is from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without, that extrinſecall being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, it is no longer: And, becauſe
from an indifferent nothing follows, its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſting
is not deriv'd from any intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call;
and, which follows, if, the extrinſecall
being taken away, it ſhould exiſt, this, <hi>its
exiſting,</hi> would be an effect without a cauſe.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="6" type="lesson">

                     <head type="sub">Of the Exiſtence, Simplicity, and
Eternity of GOD.</head>
                     <p>1. AGain, it follows, there is ſome
Thing, for whom 'tis impoſſible
not to exiſt: For, ſince an effect
is becauſe another is, 'tis clear, the ſame
cannot be the cauſe of it ſelf: nay, if two
ſhould be put, as, adequately, cauſe and
effect to one another, the ſame would be
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115975:147"/>
put as cauſe of it ſelf; for, if A be becauſe
B is, and B again becauſe A is, 'tis clear,
that A is becauſe A is, that is, 'tis cauſe and
effect to it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>2. Wherefore, ſince thoſe things that
may not-Be need an extrinſecall cauſe to
Be; nor can all things have an extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
cauſe, unleſſe ſome two be, reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
cauſes to one another: it follows, there
muſt be ſomething which needs not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall
cauſe; and conſequently, muſt
have, from its intrinſecalls, that it cannot
not-Be, and for which it muſt be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
not to <hi>Be.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Again, ſince an impoſſibility of not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſting
imports and carryes Exiſtence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with it; and this impoſſibility is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall
and eſſentiall to the Thing in
which it is; it follows, too, that Exiſtence
is eſſentiall to ſuch a Thing.</p>
                     <p>4. And, ſince exiſtence is equally uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
with the notion of Being or Thing,
that is, every Thing has an exiſtence cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent
to it, which it <hi>may</hi> actually
have; and <hi>Being</hi> is the moſt univerſall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
of that wherein 'tis; it follows, that
Exiſtence is the moſt univerſall predicate
of the Thing to which 'tis eſſentiall.</p>
                     <p>5. But, on the other ſide, becauſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115975:147"/>
being put, the Thing is compleat,
as to its eſſence; nor can any eſſentiall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
ſupervene to that which exiſts, but
all are preſuppos'd to exiſtence: 'tis clear,
that, to the moſt Genericall notion of a
Thing to which Exiſtence is eſſentiall,
there can no eſſentiall Difference ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene;
and conſequently, that, between
Things to which exiſtence is eſſentiall,
there can be no <hi>eſſentiall difference,</hi> that is,
but <hi>One</hi> only <hi>ſuch</hi> Thing can exiſt.</p>
                     <p>6. There is, therefore, ſome Thing eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially
exiſting of it ſelf; from which,
being but One only, all other Things
muſt, of neceſſity, receive their birth and
exiſtence: Now, ſuch a Thing we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be that we call GOD: There is
therefore, a GOD.</p>
                     <p>7. The notion, therefore, of God's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting
is, that his exiſtence or eſſence is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametrically
and contradictorily oppos'd
to not-Being: not, in the Underſtanding,
as a <hi>Chimaera</hi> is oppos'd to a <hi>non-Chimaera;</hi>
nor, in poſſibility, as a <hi>man</hi> to <hi>not-a-man;</hi>
nor, in an irradiate act, as it were, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
like a Seal in water, as our <hi>being</hi> and
<hi>not-being, running</hi> and <hi>not-running:</hi> but, in
the thing it ſelf, by the higheſt and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
actuality, ſubſtantially, by the very
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115975:148"/>
eſſence of Being and exerciſing, by the
very notion of exiſting, it ſelf ſubſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and concentrally within it ſelf and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it ſelf and upon it ſelf reflected, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
and exerciſing.</p>
                     <p>8. This is the ſolidity and ſtability of
the <hi>Firſt thing</hi> and GOD; whilſt, the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of all the reſt is no other, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
and <hi>Be from Him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. Out of what has been ſaid, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
the moſt eminent Simplicity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſibility
of God. For, ſince exiſtence
is eſſentiall to him; and there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in a Thing, neither before nor after
exiſtence; 'tis clear, that God is ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence,
that he is nothing beſides, formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                     <p>10. Therefore, He is not corporeall or
compos'd of parts excluding one another:
for, a Body, ſince it has a Being in parts, of
neceſſity includes ſomething beſides Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence,
diviſible from that.</p>
                     <p>11. The ſame is for compoſition of
Matter and Form, Subject and Accidents;
for theſe, ſince they include ſomething
diviſible from Being, cannot be pure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters.</p>
                     <p>12. Nor is there any room for compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Differentia;</hi> ſince, <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>
                        <pb n="271" facs="tcp:115975:148"/>
ſupervenes to a <hi>Genus,</hi> at leaſt, with a
foundation in the Object for ſo apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it. Ther's, therefore, abſolutely, no
compoſition at all in God.</p>
                     <p>13. But, whatever compoſition there is
in our Underſtanding concerning God,
proceeds out of the pure defect of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
which cannot adequate the
Simplicity of the Divine Eſſence. GOD,
therefore, <hi>is pure Being, pure Actuality, the
pure Brightneſſe of eternall Light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14. Again, hence 'tis deduc'd that God
is Eternall, or, that there is not in God
paſt and future, but only preſent. For,
ſince God cannot not-Be, by reaſon of the
eſſentiall exerciſe of his Being; and, has
this eſſentially, that he cannot not-have-been
nor not-be-to-be, but poſſeſſes his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
indiviſibly: it comes to paſſe, that
'tis the ſame thing to God not to-not-have-been
and not not-to-be, as to <hi>Be</hi> what He
<hi>is;</hi> but, there cannot be, either by imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
or in time, an inſtant ſuppos'd, in
which God poſſeſſes not his Eſſence; in
every moment, therefore, of time whether
reall or imaginary, He is his not not-to-have-been
and his not not-to-be hereafter,
that is, his to-have-been and his to-be.</p>
                     <p>15. In every inſtant of time, therefore,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:115975:149"/>
He <hi>is</hi> in every inſtant of time paſt and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
not, that the time paſt and future
<hi>are;</hi> but, that the indiviſible exiſtence of
God poſſeſſes all that length, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
times make, contracted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
of his Simplicity, in an indiviſible
act; and never either loſes or gains, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
His repugnancy to not-Being is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
Being, and Actually-to-Be is his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>

and Science of God.</head>
                     <p>1. FArther, the Perfection and Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of God is deduc'd, that is,
whatever goodneſſe and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is poſſible, all this is eminently found
in God. For, ſince exiſtence cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
exiſtence from another, but is by its
own force; 'tis plain, that whatever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
is and whatever perfection is in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
has its Being from that power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by
which exiſtence exiſts: the whole perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
therefore, of exiſtence is in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
which <hi>is of it ſelf</hi> and by its own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115975:149"/>
but this exiſtence is, as has been
ſaid, the very eſſence of God; wherefore,
in God, there is all the perfection which ist
in exiſtence or can be in it.</p>
                     <p>2. Since, therefore, whatever is in any
Thing, beſides Exiſtence, is nothing elſe
but a <hi>diſpoſition</hi> to exiſtence, or a <hi>capacity</hi>
of it, or a <hi>compart</hi> in which and by which
imperfect exiſtence is to ſubſiſt: 'tis clear,
too, that perfect exiſtence ſubſiſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
more eminently and perfectly, all
this perfection, and conſequently, that <hi>All
the Plenitude of Being is in God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Beſides, ſince God or Being-of-it-ſelf
is but One alone; whatever <hi>is</hi> beſides
muſt, of neceſſity, receive Beginning,
Goodneſſe or perfection from Him: but,
that the <hi>adequate</hi> cauſe contains all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of its effect is, of it ſelf, evident:
all that ample and inexhauſtible pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
therefore, of intire Being is in God
and flows from Him.</p>
                     <p>4. Out of theſe foreſaid Attributes of
God, his Immutability is demonſtrated:
For, from this Plenitude of Perfection,
He is Immutable; becauſe he can neither
acquire nor loſe any thing.</p>
                     <p>5. From his Simplicity, again, he is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable;
becauſe all mutation includes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="274" facs="tcp:115975:150"/>
a diviſibility of that which is chang'd, from
that according to which it is chang'd.</p>
                     <p>6. And laſtly, from His Eternity, he is
Immutable; becauſe what is chang'd has
ſometime and ſometime has-not the ſame
thing; but, what God has he has indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
for ever, and, in that very reſpect, he
cannot not-have it.</p>
                     <p>7. Out of the premiſſes, too, 'tis collected,
that God <hi>knows</hi> &amp; underſtands both Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and all other things, by his one only eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall
act of Being. For, ſince God is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
it ſelf &amp; the Plenitude of Being, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can belong to exiſtence which is not
primarily in Him: ſince, therefore, <hi>to know,</hi>
is to have the thing known, after a certain
<hi>proper manner</hi> of exiſting, in one's ſelf; God
cannot not-be in Himſelf, after this manner
of exiſting, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, not-be-known by Himſelf.</p>
                     <p>8. Again, ſince all other things are in
God; but, to inexiſt as another thing, is
a perfecter manner of inexiſting then ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to inexiſt; it appears, that all other
things in God inexiſt after this manner,
too, that is, are <hi>known.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. Nor, does this any thing prejudice
the divine Simplicity: For, ſince thoſe
things that are known inexiſt as another
thing, the bounds and diviſions of the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115975:150"/>
Creatures in God are <hi>as other things,</hi> and
produce not their effect, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>diſtinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
in Him; but, their being in Him has
nothing whereby one ſhould be oppos'd
to another; as appears even in us, in whom
two Contraries inexiſt together, that the
one may be known by the other.</p>
                     <p>10. It appears, too, that God knows o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, in his own Eſſence: which,
ſince it may doubly be underſtood; one
way, that His eſſence ſhould be the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the knowledge of other things; and
another way, that the knowledge of the
Creatures ſhould be, as it were, a part of
the knowledge of His eſſence: 'tis to be
taken this ſecond way.</p>
                     <p>11. For, ſince the Eſſence of God is
not from another, but by its own formall
power of exiſting; 'tis plain, its manner
of exiſting is oppoſite to the being from
another: there ought not, therefore, to
be put any <hi>Vertuall cauſality,</hi> whereby one
ſhould be from another in God; becauſe,
whatever is in Him <hi>is</hi> becauſe it <hi>is,</hi> or by
vertue of <hi>ſelf-being.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. You'l ſay, the Creatures are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
diſtinct and another thing from
God; wherefore, the knowledge of them,
too, is diſtinct from the knowledge of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115975:151"/>
God. 'Tis anſwer'd, by denying the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence:
for, ſome diſtinct things are
of that condition, that the knowledge of
one is part of the knowledge of another;
and ſo it happens in the preſent caſe.</p>
                     <p>13. For, ſince God cannot know his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
unleſſe he know his Science and the,
as it were-vertuall parts of his Eſſence; and,
ſince the Creatures flow immediately from
God, without any other help; it comes
to paſſe, that God is a Cauſe <hi>actually</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
by His eſſence: 'tis plain, therefore,
that part of the knowledge of the eſſence
of God is, to know that He <hi>actually</hi> cauſes
ſuch Creatures, which includes, that ſuch
Creatures exiſt: part, therefore, of the
knowledge of the divine Eſſence is to
know the Creatures exiſt, in all their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>14. Again, the univerſall anſwer is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to all thoſe queſtions, Whether God
knows Future contingents? the ſecrets of
Hearts? Infinite things? <hi>Materia prima?</hi>
Negations? Mentall or imaginary things?
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. For, 'tis evident, as far as theſe are
apt to exiſt and to be known, ſo far they
proceed from God; and the knowledge of
them is part of the knowledge of God: but
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115975:151"/>
if, on any ſide, they have no entity nor cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcibility,
ſo far they are not known by
God: But, to enquire, of each of them, what
cognoſcibility they may have, belongs to
their proper places, not to this of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of God.</p>

                     <p>1. NOr is it leſſe evident, out of what
has been ſaid, that, ſince God,
operating by Exiſtence, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
applyes himſelf to the <hi>particularities</hi>
of the Creatures, (ſince Particulars only
can exiſt); and <hi>more</hi> things cannot be in
<hi>one</hi> but by <hi>Science;</hi> that, I ſay, He makes
the Creatures by his Science: wherefore,
ſince Science, when 'tis ſo perfect as to be
able to proceed into action, is call'd <hi>Will;</hi>
'tis clear, that there is a Will in God.</p>
                     <p>2. And, ſince the Science of God is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way perfect, it appears, by the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that there is all the perfection of
Will in God, or, all <hi>Morall Vertues,</hi> as far as
they follow out of pure perfection. He is,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115975:152"/>
therefore, Gracious, Iuſt, Mercifull, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and whatever other uſe to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
of Him; out of the eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of his Eſſence, as 'tis call'd <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. And, ſince <hi>Liberty</hi> is among the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of Will, by which the Will or the
Perſon that knows chuſes one <hi>out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
according to the Principles of his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
nature; and, the Science of God is lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and more ample then His Operation;
nor is there any thing, out of himſelf, by
which he can be impell'd to operate this
<hi>more</hi> then that; 'tis clear, that God, <hi>freely</hi>
and according to his innate inclination,
chuſes and operates this <hi>rather</hi> then that.</p>
                     <p>4. You'l object, ſince God is a pure
Act, there cannot be put in God a naturall
inclination, according to which election
may be made; becauſe it would have the
notion of a Principle in reſpect of the act
of election: there cannot, therefore, be
put Liberty in God. 'Tis anſwer'd, there
cannot be put, in God, election <hi>in fieri,</hi> or,
to-be-made, but only <hi>in facto eſſe,</hi> or, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
made, that is, ſuch a Will as is election
already in act; and to this there is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
the notion of cauſe and effect.</p>
                     <p>5. Moreover, naturall inclination, as
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:115975:152"/>
'tis put in God, is not any active principle,
but a certain common and abſtracted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by which we know God; and, to
which, that more particular notion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable,
according to which we attribute
the name of <hi>election</hi> to God: as, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to this Volition, by which God will's
that which is <hi>beſt,</hi> the volition of the
World's Creation is conformable, by
which is choſen the beſt in <hi>particular.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. You'l object, again, ſince God eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
has all Vertues, He alwaies does, <hi>of
neceſsity,</hi> that which is <hi>beſt;</hi> and would doe
againſt his own Eſſence, ſhould he doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing otherwiſe then he does: 'Tis,
therefore, determin'd to him eſſentially,
to doe every thing as he does: but, that
which proceeds out of Nature and Eſſence
is not free: God, therefore, does nothing
<hi>freely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. 'Tis anſwer'd, Even in us, after we
ſee any thing to be <hi>better,</hi> 'tis againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to doe the contrary: neither are we
free, becauſe we can decede from nature;
for, ſo, Liberty would not be a perfection
but an imperfection, ſince all perfection
is according to nature: but, <hi>Liberty</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in this, That, <hi>among many, which, at
the beginning, ſeem indifferent, we can find
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115975:153"/>
which is more according to nature; and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
that, becauſe 'tis conformable to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. Therefore, in God, too, Liberty is,
ſo, to be put, that it be underſtood He has
arriv'd, by his Science and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to act what is conformable to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and though, after He's ſuppos'd to
have arriv'd to that, 'tis againſt His eſſence
to doe another thing or not to doe this;
yet, His Liberty is not, thence, diminiſht:
as, there is not leſſe liberty in a conſtant
Man, that changes not his judgement
once eſtabliſht, then in a Fool, that, at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
little appearance of reaſon, alters his
opinion, but a greater; for, a conſtant
Man, therefore, changes not, becauſe he
alwaies exerciſes his wiſely-made choice,
that is, the better, whereas a light perſon
exerciſes now the worſe, now the better.</p>
                     <p>9. Again, for the moſt part, thoſe
things that are-not-choſen are not againſt
the nature of the chooſer, <hi>in themſelves,</hi> but
from ſome <hi>Accident</hi> or complex of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
whence, the terms preciſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd,
the chooſer may doe them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to nature, but, becauſe of ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
he cannot: And, even thus,
Liberty may be attributed to God; for,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115975:153"/>
to doe ſome particular thing, which he
does not, is not againſt the nature of God
preciſely compar'd to <hi>this</hi> Thing; but,
when the other circumſtances are colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
it appears another thing is better,
and then 'tis againſt the nature of God to
doe this: yet, this prejudices not His Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
which conſiſts in this, that He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that which, <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> is <hi>according</hi> to
His nature, becauſe, <hi>by accident,</hi> 'tis <hi>againſt</hi>
it; which we experience in our ſelves to
be the track and path of Liberty.</p>
                     <p>10. You'l ſay, that God is determin'd
by the very Being of his Eſſence; and, ſo
in Him can be underſtood no indifferency
to the utmoſt circumſtance. 'Tis anſwer'd,
this hinders not but that we are neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to conceive That perfectly-determin'd
Eſſence, by divers abſtractive notions; in
one of which this determination is not, ſo
preciſely and by deſign, expreſt as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and ſo, to us, the more particular of
them becomes the determination of the
more common; and of both is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the notion of <hi>liberty exercis'd</hi> in God.</p>
                     <p>11. You'l object, thirdly, If God were
free, he could not-doe what he does; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
'twere poſſible for him not to have
the Volition and Science which He has;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115975:154"/>
'tis poſſible, therefore, there ſhould not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
the <hi>ſame</hi> God. 'Tis anſwer'd, by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God can make that which He does
not; but, by denying the conſequence,
that He could have another volition then
he has: for, when we ſay, God can make
another thing then He does, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the <hi>Power</hi> of God or His fecundity
with the <hi>Object</hi> whereof we ſpeak; but,
when we ſpeak of his Volition, we ſpeak of
his <hi>Vnderſtanding compleated</hi> to action, and
This proceeds to action upon the <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of all <hi>accidents,</hi> out of which, as 'tis
ſaid, it happens that this object is not
made, becauſe 'tis <hi>not-beſt</hi> and againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>12. 'Tis, therefore, to be deny'd that
there can be in God another act of voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or, that his Will is indifferent to this
and another act; though his effective
power, taken abſtractedly, is indifferent to
more, becauſe it reſpects the only notion
of Being, or, Thing, in them: And thus,
'tis evident, how there is not, thence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
any poſſible mutability in God.</p>
                     <p>13. You'l ſay, His Will, abſtractedly
taken, is indifferent, too, to more acts. 'Tis
anſwer'd, we ſpeak not of the Will as it
means the <hi>faculty,</hi> to be abſtracted in God;
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115975:154"/>
but of the Will as it ſignifies the <hi>act</hi> or <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition;</hi>
and that alwaies imports that the
laſt determination is made, though it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
not what 'tis: whence, the notion
of it is different from his <hi>Omnipotency,</hi>
which, becauſe 'tis referr'd to things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
does not of neceſſity imply the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
act.</p>

                     <p>1. OUt of what has been ſaid, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
of God, we find farther, that
the <hi>Names</hi> which we attribute to
God are all imperfect, and, not one of
them all has any notion whoſe formall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

&amp; the ſignifications of all our Names:</p>
                     <p>2. And is, too, Exiſtence ſubſiſting;
but we have but one only name and noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of exiſtence, which ſignifies nothing
beſides: 'Tis clear, that our names do infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely

becauſe God is in none of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments;
in their integrity, becauſe no

                     <p>3. Whence, again, 'tis clear, that all the

pronounc'd of the Creatures then
of God.</p>
                     <p>4. You'l object, Perfections ſimply-ſimple
are formally in God, and more ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
in Him then in the Creatures:
names, therefore, ſignifying theſe, are
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115975:155"/>
more originally ſpoken of God then of
the Creatures. 'Tis anſwer'd, that, 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
all names whatever are tranſlated
from the Creatures to God; whence, there
can be no doubt which ſignification is the
former: but beſides, 'tis falſe that there
are Perfections ſimply-ſimple (as Divines
term them) in created things, which can
be ſignifi'd by humane names; but thoſe
things which are ſimply, that is, <hi>for-them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves-purely,</hi>
deſirable by us, we call ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply-ſimple
perfections, and, through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
think they are ſimply deſirable by
every Thing.</p>
                     <p>5. But, ther's none of theſe formally in
God, as 'tis prov'd; and, if any were, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
then the ſame name would ſignifie
God and a Creature, in the ſame ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and would be univocall. Nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
it, that theſe perfections deſcend
from God: for ſo do all others, which
yet they know are metaphorically tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd.</p>
                     <p>6. This notwithſtanding, the names
which are ſpoken of God are truly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and it may be argu'd from one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in Him: For, ſince he that ſpeaks
knows he underſtands not what that is
which he ſignifies by this name; but knows
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:115975:156"/>
'tis ſuch as has effects, like thoſe proceed
from that perfection, which is call'd by
this name in Creatures: 'tis clear, that
this name truly, both ſignifies what is in
God, becauſe the ſpeaker means to ſignify
this; and, in ſome ſort, makes known
God to us, ſince it manifeſts God to be
ſomething, whence ſuch like effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
as from a <hi>juſt,</hi> a <hi>mercifull &amp;c.</hi> Man.</p>
                     <p>7. And, ſince ſuch effects <hi>contain</hi> others in
them, or <hi>produce</hi> them out of themſelves,
or they <hi>accompany</hi> them: 'tis clear again,
from the affirmation of the ſaid names, we
may proceed to the affirming others;
which may ſignifie, that the conſequent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
too, have their root in God, or, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
conformable to their root in Men.</p>
                     <p>8. You'l object, at leaſt, There are three
kinds of names, which are pronounc'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
of God: <hi>Proper names,</hi> which agree
not to any other, as, to be GOD, <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
Omniſcient,</hi> and the like, which ſuit not
with any Creature, &amp; conſequently, are, of
neceſſity, attributed <hi>properly</hi> to God: next,
<hi>Relatives,</hi> as, to be a <hi>Creatour, Lord, Iudge, &amp;c.</hi>
which, being they ſpeak onely an extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
denomination from their effect, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be doubted but they are properly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd,
ſince, doubtleſſe, their effects are
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115975:156"/>
from Him: laſtly, <hi>Negative names,</hi> which,
ſince they only deny ſomething of God,
cannot be counted improper; ſuch are, to be
<hi>incorporeall, immateriall, infinite, immenſe, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. 'Tis anſwer'd, Even <hi>theſe</hi> names, too,
are improperly ſpoken of God. For, firſt,
thoſe which ſeem to be <hi>Properly</hi> ſpoken of
God include ſomething common to be the
<hi>baſis</hi> of what is ſuperadded, which makes a
Proper name; ſince, therefore, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
is improperly ſpoken, that proper,
too, which includes that common, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
ſpoken: as, when God is call'd <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mniſcient,</hi>
the <hi>Searcher of Hearts, &amp;c.</hi> if Science
be improperly ſpoken, then Omniſcient, if
a Searcher, Powerfull, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and Searcher of hearts are ſpoken im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly;
and the ſame is of the notion,
GOD, whether we take it for a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of all, or whatever elſe.</p>
                     <p>10. Again, 'tis falſe that <hi>Relative names</hi>
ſpeak nothing intrinſecall, but only an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall
denomination: for, they ſignify
a <hi>proportion</hi> and a <hi>community</hi> of the nature
of things, which have either an unity or
coordination in acting &amp; ſuffering, or a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
ſubjection;</hi> which, if they are not in the
things, (as, in God, in reſpect of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they cannot be), at leaſt, they are in
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:115975:157"/>
the Soul, ſince they are expreſs'd in words;
and conſequently, even ſuch Names, too,
are improperly pronounc'd.</p>
                     <p>11. Laſtly, <hi>Negative names,</hi> when they
are ſimple, ſignifie ſome <hi>poſitive diſpoſition;</hi>
as, to be <hi>blind</hi> or <hi>lame</hi> expreſſe a vitious
and defective diſpoſition of the Legs or
Eyes: and ſo likewiſe, to be incorporeall,
immateriall, infinite <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in God, explicate
a difference of Subſtance diſtinct from
corporeity and limitedneſſe, that is, a <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>
under the ſame <hi>genus;</hi> whence, they
are improperly ſpoken of God.</p>
                     <p>12. But, if a <hi>purely-negative</hi> propoſition
were pronounc'd of God, it would not be
improper: Whence, that Science which
inquires into the Impropriety of the
names which are ſpoken of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
all things of Him, is the moſt ſublime
and proper of all.</p>

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115975:157"/>
For, there being three degrees of them,
The firſt, of thoſe which ſignifie things
the moſt excellent in and ſimply deſirable
by men; ſuch as are thoſe we call the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
both Morall and Intellectuall: The
ſecond degree, of thoſe Goods of the ſame

include imperfection; ſuch as are the
goods of Animals or the other Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Man: laſtly, The third, of thoſe which
ſignifie directly and formally imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</p>
                     <p>2.<note place="margin">N. 5, 6, &amp;c.</note> 'Tis clear, theſe laſt are
moſt ſhamefully attributed to
God, and only by ignorance:
but, the middle ones, by tranſlation, that a
name ſhould be, as it were, firſt by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Metaphor,</hi> uſed toſignify ſome Vertue
and, then again that borrow'd ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſhould be transferr'd to God; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
when we call a Man a <hi>Lamb</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Meek,</hi> a <hi>Lion</hi> for <hi>couragious,</hi> we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
too, to call God a <hi>Lamb</hi> and a <hi>Lion,</hi>
by the ſame right as we, before, call'd Him
<hi>meek</hi> or <hi>couragious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. You'l ask, ſince both the names of
<hi>couragious</hi> and a <hi>Lion</hi> are improperly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of God, why <hi>this</hi> ſhould be eſteem'd
ſpoken ſymbolically and metaphorically,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:115975:158"/>
and <hi>that</hi> properly? 'Tis anſwer'd, that, in
the Creatures we ſee both the terms,
and, therefore, we eaſily diſcern when a
name is ſpoken metaphorically and not
properly; for we ſee a <hi>Lion</hi> to be another
thing then <hi>Courage:</hi> but, when names are
transferr'd to God, one of the extremes is
obſcure to us, and conſequently, the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation,
too.</p>
                     <p>4. Moreover, in a <hi>Lamb,</hi> a <hi>Lion, &amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
meekneſſe and courage, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things, which 'tis not the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſpeaker to transferre: but, in
meekneſſe and fortitude, ther's nothing
but their own particular notions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it ſeems that, of neceſſity, either they
muſt be in God to whom they are apply'd,
or elſe the name cannot be at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
of him: and, therefore, many
think theſe are formally in the <hi>Divinity;</hi>
though they miſtake.</p>
                     <p>5. Out of what has been ſaid, 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
that ſome things cannot be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God, which yet are commonly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Him. Firſt, a <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> whether
formall or vertuall, between his <hi>Predicates:</hi>
for, they that affirm theſe things obſerve
not that Diſtinction is a name of negation
and imperfection; whence, for theſe to be
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115975:158"/>
in Him, either vertually or eminently, is
as much as that He can be nothing or
defect.</p>
                     <p>6. Worſe, yet, is the notion of <hi>Cauſe</hi>
and <hi>Effect,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Himſelf,</hi> attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God; for example, that his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
flow vertually from his Eſſence, that
He underſtands other things becauſe He
underſtands himſelf, that He wills the
means becauſe He wills the end, and the
like: for, 'tis clear, that the notion of an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
likewiſe, ſpeaks imperfection; whence,
'tis no eminency to precontain it.</p>
                     <p>7. Like this 'tis, to put <hi>Inſtants</hi> either
of nature or Intellectuall, in one of which
ſome thing ſhould be and another thing
not-be in God, till the next inſtant: for,
by this, there is put a poſteriority in God,
which is imperfection.</p>
                     <p>8. But, fouleſt of all, God is put to <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi>
Creatures, or to <hi>depend</hi> on them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
poſſible or actuall; as, when 'tis
ſaid, the Intuitive Viſion of God ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the futurition of Creatures; that
God knows not a free act but in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence;
that a conditionate futuriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is preſuppos'd, before the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the divine Providence; and ſuch like:
which, ſince they make the Divine eſſence,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115975:159"/>
really, both poſteriour to and depending
upon Creatures, are intolerable and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</p>
                     <p>9. The <hi>Imperfections,</hi> too, either of the
Things God has made or of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
they unwarily caſt upon God:
as, when God wills the Means ſhould be
for the End, they weakly ſuſpect that He
wills the Means becauſe He wills the End;
when any one act of God is conceiv'd by
us, we not conceiving another, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that there is ſomething in God, too,
whence one notion may be, though ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be ſuppos'd not-to-be.</p>
                     <p>10. It appears, out of what has hitherto
been ſaid, that, of all the names attributed
to God, the name of BEING ſounds
leaſt imperfection: for, both it ſtands in
the higheſt degree of Actuality, whereas
the reſt ſpeak Act only; and 'tis moſt Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall,
whence it has this, both to contain
all things and not to be bound to differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and therefore, to include the pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of perfection: and laſtly, Being or
Exiſtence is perfecter then Eſſence, which
is nothing but a capacity to that; but, all
other things are in the order of Eſſences
and more imperfect.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Exiſtence, Nature, and
Science of INTELLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GENCES.</head>
                     <p>1. OUt of the premiſſes, 'tis eaſily
collected, that there is ſome
Subſtance, by its nature and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally,
incorporeall: For, ſince God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is Being of himſelf, and whatever is
produc'd participates exiſtence from Him,
and Exiſtence, among thoſe things which
integrate a Thing, is the leaſt unlike God,
and is the moſt perfect and ſupreme; it
appears, that all other things which are in a
Thing are caus'd by God, by the means of
Exiſtence, and that alone immediately
flows from God; and, by conſequence,
nothing is immediately made by God,
which is not in the Creature in vertue of
Exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>2. Again, 'tis clear, that, ſuppoſing
whatever Bodies to exiſt, they, becauſe
they are many, muſt be in a determinate
place: and becauſe, the ſame things being
put and none chang'd, there alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:115975:160"/>
the ſame; all Bodies, in vertue of Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
alone, if nothing be chang'd in them,
will alwaies remain in the ſame place; and
conſequently, in vertue of God alone and
Bodies, there will not any Motion follow.</p>
                     <p>3. Since, therefore, it appears in bodies,
that there is motion; 'tis evident, there
is ſome incorporeall Creature: which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis requir'd to give the firſt motion
to Bodies, cannot be a ſeparated Soul, whoſe
birth preſuppoſes the motion of Bodies.</p>
                     <p>4. 'Tis plain, again, that, ſince this Creature
receiv's its Being from God, of it ſelf it may
not-be; &amp; conſequently, includes in it ſelf a
diviſibility of Exiſtence from its Eſſence.</p>
                     <p>5.<note place="margin">B. 4. Leſ. 3. N. 6.</note> Again, out of what has
been ſaid concerning a Body,
'tis evident, that 'tis not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of Matter and Form; and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of Exiſtence with any thing above
it is impoſſible, ſince Exiſtence is the moſt
formall Form of a Thing, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there can be nothing more formall or
ſuperiour to it in the Thing whoſe 'tis.</p>
                     <p>6. Counting, therefore, thoſe things
which integrate a Thing or Being, there
are three kinds of Things: GOD, filling
the higheſt degree of Exiſtence; <hi>Bodies,</hi> by
their latitude immenſly expanding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
of Matter; and <hi>This</hi> middle kind of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115975:160"/>
                        <hi>Act,</hi> neither eſſentially actualiz'd, nor flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into matter, poſſeſſing and filling a
kind of middle order of ſubſiſting.</p>
                     <p>7. 'Tis, therefore, a <hi>pure Act,</hi> becauſe 'tis
not mingled with a ſubſtantiall power or
poſſibility: 'tis not the <hi>pureſt,</hi> becauſe 'tis
compounded with Exiſtence, which is a
Subſtantiall compoſition &amp;, as is manifeſt,
common to all but that <hi>One Thing of-it-ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. Again, 'tis evident, that an incorpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Creature is Intellective; &amp;, ſo, actually,
Underſtanding: for, ſince the neceſſity of
its exiſtence is collected from the motion
of Bodies, 'tis evident, it has ſome power to
alter Bodies, that their <hi>motion</hi> may follow;
wherefore, ſince action proceeds from an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
as it <hi>actually</hi> is, that motion of Bodies
muſt, of neceſſity, be <hi>actually</hi> in this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
&amp; conſequently, the Bodies chang'd.</p>
                     <p>9. Since, therefore, ther's no Matter in
this Creature, nor, conſequently, any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of matter, as its motion or
quality; it comes to paſſe, that Bodies are
in It as exiſting in <hi>themſelves,</hi> that is, <hi>as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing:</hi> ſince, therefore, to be <hi>known</hi> is,
<hi>to be, as another thing, in another,</hi> this our
Creature is Cognoſcitive; and ſince, to be
known by the notion of Being, or as
exiſting, is to be <hi>underſtood;</hi> and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
things are known to exiſt; the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115975:161"/>
Creature we are in ſearch of is an IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TELLIGENCE.</p>
                     <p>10. It follows, too, that an Intelligence,
in its own eſſence known, knows God and
all other things that exiſt: For, ſince an
Intelligence has whereto an exiſting thing
may be conjoyn'd, retaining the property
of its being <hi>another;</hi> &amp;, its own Eſſence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting
is intimately conjoyn'd to this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
'tis clear, that It primarily and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
ſo inexiſts.</p>
                     <p>11. And, ſince, knowing that its own Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
exiſts, it muſt needs ſee that It exiſts
accidentally; it ſees evidently, that It has
a Cauſe of exiſting, and that ſuch an One
as we have been in ſearch of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove:
It ſees,<note place="margin">Leſ. 6, 7, &amp;c.</note> therefore, in its
own Eſſence, that God is, and is
ſuch as we have been enquiring after, and
far perfecter then we can decypher.</p>
                     <p>12. It ſees, therefore, that nature actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
emanes and flows out from Him; and,
becauſe it ſees what is the End of nature,
<hi>viz.</hi> that ſo many kinds and ſubdiviſions
of Animals ſhould ſhoot-out and ripen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Spirits of eternall Being; It ſees what
is neceſſary for this; and conſequently,
the whole Plot of the World, and wherein
It ſelf will be uſefull for it.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the compariſon of Intelligences
to Souls and Bodies.</head>
                     <p>1. TIs clear, too, that an Intelligence
has a reall diviſibility of Eſſence
from knowledge: for, ſince, 'tis
of the notion of the knowledge of its Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
that it exiſts, and its exiſting is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
from Its eſſence; much more the
knowing its exiſtence, which is poſteriour
to and ſuppoſes its exiſtence;</p>
                     <p>2. Since, too, its Eſſen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is limited to
a certain degree of exiſtence whereof 'tis
capable; 'tis clear, the plenitude of Being
is not eſſentiall to It: Since, therefore, by
Its knowledge, It has the plenitude of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
knowledge is not <hi>eſſentiall</hi> to It:
There is, therefore, a non-repugnancy in
Its eſſence to the not-having ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and conſequently, a reall diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of its Eſſence againſt its know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>3. You'l ſay, that <hi>power</hi> is in vain which
is never reduc'd to <hi>act;</hi> but, this diviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is not reduc'd to act; therefore, 'tis
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115975:162"/>
in vain, &amp; ther's none. 'Tis anſwer'd, 'tis not
a power, but a non-repugnancy, which
was in act whilſt the Intelligence exiſted
not.</p>
                     <p>4. Out of what has been ſaid, we are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
to the compariſon of an Intelligence
to a ſeparated Soul: for, as they agree, in
that they are both immateriall Things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting
by their own exiſtence; ſo, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree,
in that an Intelligence is <hi>adequate</hi>
to its exiſtence, but a ſeparated Soul
exiſts by an exiſtence which is, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>common</hi> to the <hi>Body,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
'tis not adequate to its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>5. Again, though both underſtand
their own Eſſence and, by that, other
things; yet 'tis with this difference, that
an Intelligence has this knowledge of it
ſelf from its manner of exiſting, but, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
Soul,<note place="margin">Leſ. 2. N. 8.</note> from its Body:
for, when, as 'tis above ſaid,
ſomething ſtrikes a man, it makes him
know <hi>that is,</hi> becauſe it ſtrikes him; but,
his being ſtruck includes that <hi>he is;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in all knowledge, a man muſt needs
know that himſelf <hi>is:</hi> The Soul, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
has, in its firſt knowledge, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of its own exiſtence and, from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115975:162"/>
receiv's the knowledge of its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
which unleſſe it carry'd along with
it, it could not reflect upon it ſelf whilſt
'tis ſeparated, becauſe 'tis a power or
poſſibility; for a <hi>power</hi> is indifferent
to an <hi>act</hi> and <hi>non-act,</hi> and has neither
but by force of an Agent diſtinct from
it.</p>
                     <p>6. This, therefore, is the univerſall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of ſeparated Souls from Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
and proper to them as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat
Spirits: that a Soul, out of the
pure notion of its identity with its Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
does not inform its Underſtanding;
for, otherwiſe, it would not be a <hi>power:</hi>
but an Intelligence has this, out of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
genericall manner of its nature, by the
force of identity To be preſent to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective
vertue.</p>
                     <p>7. Hence, again, it follows, that a Soul,
in vertue of thoſe things which are in it
by the communion of the body, is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
to all other things: but, an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
in vertue of its own Eſſence exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>8. A Soul, therefore, even in ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
uſes theſe common notions it findes,
impreſs'd in it; and conſequently, too,
by other ſuch like, attains to the pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115975:163"/>
of Being: but an Intelligence, by
the pure degrees of Things, at ſight of one
Thing, tranſcends to another, nor needs
incomplete notions.</p>
                     <p>9. Laſtly, a Soul, becauſe 'tis naturally
the compart of a <hi>certain</hi> Body, is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
to <hi>that,</hi> nor can act upon another
but by means of the motion and affection
of <hi>its own</hi> Body: and, it affects its proper
body by identification; becauſe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
or alteration of one is, of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the alteration of the other, according
to its manner, by reaſon of their <hi>iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. But, an Intelligence is not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
to any Body, but <hi>indifferent,</hi> and is
determin'd only by <hi>choice</hi> to this rather
then that; and changes that, becauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it ſelf in act and exerciſe, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
according as the corporeall nature is
ſubject to It, paſſes into the Body, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the Intelligence is in <hi>ſuch</hi> a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>11. Again, ſince an Intelligence and a
Body are call'd, univocally, Things, and
the notion of <hi>exiſtence</hi> is found the <hi>ſame</hi> in
both; and all exiſtence which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
with eſſence is, of neceſſity, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
to a part of Being, and <hi>limited:</hi> but,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115975:163"/>
between two limited Things under the
ſame univocall notion, there muſt needs
be a <hi>proportion:</hi> 'tis evident, that Bodies
are not <hi>infinitely</hi> inferiour to Intelligences,
in the notion of <hi>Subſtance;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that the <hi>action,</hi> too, of an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
upon a Body is not but in <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. And indeed, if the operation of an
Intelligence, <hi>viz. motion,</hi> were ſuppos'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
in reſpect of a Body: it would
not be <hi>connaturall</hi> for an Intelligence to
<hi>move</hi> a Body, but to change it <hi>inſtantly,</hi> nor
for a Body to be mov'd by It: That na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
therefore, might grow up by <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd</hi>
degrees, there would need a kind of
Thing of a <hi>middle</hi> nature, between Bodies
and ſeparated Souls, on one ſide, as the
<hi>Summe</hi> and <hi>fruit</hi> of Bodies; and an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
on the other; to which <hi>middle Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
it ſhould be <hi>connaturall</hi> to move Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                     <p>13. Be it, therefore, certain that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence's
power of moving is limited;
but yet, rais'd, too, above the motive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of a Soul: and immediately 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
that, becauſe there are many prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily-mov'd
Bodies and, as it were, <hi>Suns;</hi>
nor is it likely that one Intelligence can
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:115975:164"/>
move them all; many Intelligences, too,
<hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>ſeverall,</hi> to the <hi>ſeverall Suns,</hi> muſt be
aſſign'd.</p>

diſtinguiſht, in that One com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
the Univerſe, by <hi>fewer</hi> links and

the <hi>Supreme,</hi> by one diviſibility, knows
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:115975:164"/>
whatever <hi>is</hi> and what, according to the
order of nature, can follow out of theſe;
and this capacity follows out of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude
and <hi>eminency</hi> of its Subſtance: the
<hi>loweſt</hi> is that which has, for the ſeverall
Subſtances, <hi>ſeverall</hi> diviſibilities.</p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis manifeſt, out of what has been
ſaid, that there is a perfect <hi>Subordination</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Intelligences: for, the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
comprehend the <hi>adequate</hi> perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Inferiours, and not <hi>in part</hi> only,
as 'tis in Bodies.</p>
                     <p>4. Moreover, a Superiour is active
upon a <hi>greater</hi> body, or <hi>more</hi> active upon
an <hi>equall</hi> body, then an Inferiour: whence,
if each be ſuppos'd willing to act <hi>diverſly</hi>
upon the ſame body, the Superiour will
prevail, and the Inferiour will not be able
to act.</p>
                     <p>5. It appears, notwithſtanding, that
this Subordination extends not, to this,
that a Superiour Intelligence can act
upon an Inferiour, or contrariwiſe: for,
ſince there is not in an Intelligence any
notion of <hi>power</hi> or poſſibility, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
neither is there any <hi>mutability;</hi>
but, as Its exiſtence once infus'd, by reaſon
of the connection with its Form which
has not an indifference <hi>to more,</hi> remains
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115975:165"/>
unchangeable as long as its Form; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
the knowledges of an Intelligence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
like Accidents, be preſent and abſent,
but, once infus'd by the power of the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
they are ſubject to no mutation but
from <hi>Him.</hi> Since, therefore, there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diviſibility of an Intelligence, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Its <hi>being</hi> or its <hi>knowing;</hi> 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
It can receive no change from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Intelligence.</p>
                     <p>6. 'Tis apparent, too, that, becauſe an
Intelligence embraces whole nature, by
neceſſary <hi>deduction;</hi> It has, of neceſſity, in
its very <hi>birth,</hi> all the good which 'tis or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
to have: ſince, the <hi>good</hi> of every
thing is that which is <hi>according to its nature,</hi>
and, the whole poſſible good which can
belong to a Creature, whoſe entire nature
is to be intellectuall, is to <hi>underſtand:</hi>
whence, ſince an Intelligence underſtands
all things by force of its nativity; by the
ſame gift that gives It <hi>being,</hi> it arrives to
the poſſeſſion of all connaturall good.</p>
                     <p>7. Every Intelligence, therefore, is
bleſſed, in reſpect of the good it poſſeſſes;
nor can it loſe this Beatitude, more then
Its eſſence with which 'tis conjoyn'd.</p>
                     <p>8. Laſtly, 'tis evident, there are three
things chiefly to be conſider'd in Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:115975:165"/>
Underſtanding, Will, and Action:
among which, Action is the meaneſt, as
being about inferiour things; &amp; though,
by it, they rule over Bodies as Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet thoſe things muſt needs be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
by which themſelves are <hi>perfected,</hi>
which things belong to the <hi>Vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. And, the Will differs no otherwiſe
from the Underſtanding, then the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Underſtanding from the perfect: for,
when the things that are underſtood are
appropriated to the <hi>nature</hi> of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtander,
and are made ſomething of it,
then the Underſtanding begins to be Will.
'Tis evident, therefore, that the Will is of
<hi>thoſe</hi> intelligible things, the underſtanding
whereof <hi>moſt of all</hi> perfects the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                     <p>10. Wherefore, the greateſt nobility
of Intelligences is, to excell according to
Will; the middle, according to Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
the loweſt, according to Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
though, 'tis clear, that theſe notions
are ſo correſpondent to one another in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences,
that, as much as the Will of
one excells that of another, ſo much, too,
muſt both its Underſtanding and power
of Acting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="306" facs="tcp:115975:166"/>
11. Now, that the multitude of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
is but <hi>finite,</hi> 'tis evident from hence,
becauſe all Multitude (ſince it riſes and is
encreas'd from One by Unities, and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
cannot be a ſtep from a finite to an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity)
of neceſſity, is finite.</p>
                     <p>12. But, ſince they are not made for
the good of another thing, as <hi>their</hi> End;
nor have any thing common, whereby
they ſhould naturally reſpect one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
nor any order of cauſe and effect;
and there is no term, no limits of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding:
limitation, among them, cannot
depend on any other, then the occult <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi>
of their Natures, by which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrate

                     <p>1. FRom the knowledge of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
by the ſame ſteps we are led
to the knowledge of their Actions.
Firſt, therefore, 'tis evident, out of what
has been ſaid, that, ſince God alone exiſts
of himſelf and eſſentially, ſomething flows
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115975:166"/>
                        <hi>immediately</hi> from Him; and conſequently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is created, and that God <hi>creates:</hi> for, 'tis
evident, what is made is made out of no
preſuppos'd matter; ſince God himſelf
is mutable, and no Thing, beſides, preex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts.</p>
                     <p>2. 'Tis plain, too, this Action is in an
inſtant: for, were it in Time, ſince, in the
intermediate Time, there is no Subſtance
wherein it ſhould be <hi>ſubjected,</hi> it would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſubſiſt nor be in another: wherefore,
of neceſſity, ſome Subſtance flows <hi>inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly</hi>
from God.</p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis manifeſt, therefore, that both
the Intelligences and the firſt Bodies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from God, by ſuch Action.</p>
                     <p>4. Nor muſt it be ask'd, by what <hi>extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall</hi>
power they receive birth from God:
for, ſince God is eſſentially Being it ſelf,
'tis plain, that whatever is requir'd, intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally,
for God to be a cauſe actually cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
is eſſentially found in God; and,
ſince nothing beſides himſelf exiſts, that
which is in Him is of ſuch vertue that the
effect follows; wherefore, 'tis a neceſſary
conſequence, becauſe the ſubſiſtent Being
is <hi>Being</hi> it ſelf, Creatures are, or, if Being
be, the Creature is; as if you ſhould
ſay, if the Sun be not capable of its own
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:115975:167"/>
light, the things about it are illuminated,
or, if the Fountain overflows, the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
is watred.</p>
                     <p>5.<note place="margin">Leſſ. 13. n. 5.</note> Again, ſince an Intelligence
can neither act upon God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
He is immutable, nor upon
another Intelligence, nor upon a ſeparated
Soul, which, as to that, is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with an Intelligence; its action is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
about Bodies: And, Action about a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
if it be compounded of more, is known
by the <hi>ſimples</hi> whereof 'tis compounded;
now, that there are only three ſimple Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
has been evidenc'd, (by ſhewing how
all Actions are perform'd) in our <hi>Phyſicks,
viz.</hi> locall Motion, Condenſation, and
Rarefaction.</p>
                     <p>6. And, for <hi>Locall Motion,</hi> 'tis manifeſt
that 'tis, really, nothing but the diviſion
of a Magnitude: and the diviſion of a
Magnitude conſiſts both of the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the dividing body to the divided,
and its ſeparation from the body with
which 'twas formerly one: to conjunction
there's nothing elſe requir'd, but that no
Quantity keep off the Place from what is
plac'd in it,<note place="margin">B. 2. Leſ. 2. N. 7.</note> ſince Magnitudes
between which no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſes,
even by that, are
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115975:167"/>
one together; now, that there ſhould not
be another between them is a certain ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
notion and, by conſequence, is not
made by an Agent on ſet purpoſe, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
out of the Action of a Body intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
another thing, <hi>viz.</hi> from a body <hi>impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. But, the body impelling either it
ſelf changes place, without any other mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and then, it ſelf, too, is impell'd;
or elſe, from ſome other mutation only it
receiv's the being impell'd, or, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe,
to impell: Since, therefore, beſides
diviſion, there are but two ſimple mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Rarefaction and Condenſation, and
condenſation is both a <hi>negative</hi> action, as
being the leſs'ning of Quantity, nor
makes it the body aſpire to anothers place;
'tis plain, there's no ſimple, properly call'd,
action in bodies, but <hi>Rarefaction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. Since, therefore, 'tis clear, that the
Action of an Intelligence is a ſimple and
properly an Action, as, that which begins
and cauſes the action of all other bodies;
it comes to paſſe, that the proper Action
of an Intelligence upon Bodies is Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
And, ſince ther's no other action,
properly, upon a body, nor has an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
any action upon any other thing
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:115975:168"/>
but a body; it follows, that Rarefaction
alone is the action of an Intelligence.</p>
                     <p>9. You'l ask, wherein conſiſts this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of an Intelligence upon a body? or,
what conſequence is this, An <hi>Angel wills,</hi>
therefore a <hi>Body</hi> is <hi>rarefy'd?</hi> 'Tis anſwer'd,
out of what has been ſaid, 'tis clear, that
an Intelligence, by <hi>love</hi> or deſire, ingrafts
the thing to be done into Its own Eſſence
and exiſtence, in a <hi>particular</hi> manner, as if
it were ſomething of It ſelf: whence, 'tis
plain, that the Intelligence, by the act of
its own being ſtands bent to the Body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which 'tis to act, according to all the
circumſtances neceſſary, out of its own
knowledge to the Effect.</p>
                     <p>10. On the other ſide, 'tis plain, both
that the Body is ſuſceptible of the deſired
effect, and that the effect follows out of,
or rather, is but the eminency and exceſſe
of its own act, or Form, that is, Quantity,
upon matter, nay, of its commoneſt act or
<hi>corporeity;</hi> as alſo, that the Body is, in ſome
ſort, <hi>continu'd</hi> to the Intelligence, by its
Form or Subſtantiall act.</p>
                     <p>11. And, though the act of the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
is of another kind, yet, becauſe the
notion of <hi>exiſtence,</hi> to which both diſpoſe,
is the ſame; the act of the Body muſt
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:115975:168"/>
needs, from the aſſiſtance of the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
grow, as it were, and be chear'd;
and conſequently, more overmaſter its
poſſibility; and, which follows, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
be made rarer, either to the <hi>tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
of the Subſtantiall Form, or within
the <hi>ſame</hi> nature.</p>
                     <p>12. We anſwer, again, 'Tis evident,
that, preciſely out of the notion of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
ther's a <hi>connection</hi> between the
underſtander and that which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood:
In ſuch an one as receiv's his Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from the Objects, the Object is the
cauſe of Underſtanding; in one whoſe
Underſtanding is His <hi>being,</hi> the <hi>being</hi> of
the thing underſtood is from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
laſtly, in one whoſe Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is neither his <hi>being,</hi> nor from the
<hi>object,</hi> but concreated and <hi>naturall</hi> to him,
the <hi>changes</hi> in that which is underſtood (if
it admit of any without the change of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence)
may be from him.</p>
                     <p>13. Next, from hence is underſtood
the operation of a Body, wherein that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts,
<hi>viz.</hi> in nothing elſe but in the formall
power of exiſting what it is. For, let there be
three bodies, A, B, C. following one another
between the parallell ſides of three places,
or of one place equall to all the three; and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115975:169"/>
let an Intelligence rarify A: ſince that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
encreaſe, unleſſe either B be diminiſh't
or driven on, ſo long as 'tis eaſier for B to
be condens'd then to drive on C, ſo long
B will be condens'd; when 'tis arriv'd to
the term of condenſation, by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
it encroaches into the place of C, and
forces C to enter into the place of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
till 'tis come into ſo ample or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſable
a field, that the rarefaction of A
operates nothing elſe but condenſing
the fartheſt body, and then the motion
ceaſes.</p>
                     <p>14. The operation, therefore, of A is,
to be <hi>greater,</hi> whence follows A 's being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited,
according to ſome part of it, to the
place of B: Again, the operation of B is,
either to be made <hi>leſſe</hi> and ſo only to quit
its place, or elſe, keeping it ſelf in its
Quantity, to unite it ſelf with the place of
C: Since, therefore, to be united to the
place of C is nothing elſe, but to be a

of C ther's nothing interpos'd; the whole
operation of B and A is no other, then <hi>to
be what they are,</hi> by a kind of formall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</p>
                     <p>15. Becauſe, therefore, a body has no
operation but diviſion, 'tis plain, that the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:115975:169"/>
whole action of a body is reduc'd to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what it is, or a <hi>formall conſiſtency</hi> in its
proportion of Quantity to Matter and its
continuity to place; and, that its true
power of acting is infus'd by Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                     <p>16. 'Tis plain, too, that an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
by that one rarefactive Vertue, can
operate whatever is to be done by Bodies:
For, ſince all corporeall action is perfected
by diviſion, and diviſion is arriv'd to by
this vertue, all action of a Body is attain'd
to by this vertue.</p>

                     <p>1. HEnce, we are arriv'd to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of Subſtances: For,
ſince ſome are produc'd out of
<hi>nothing,</hi> ſome out of <hi>others</hi> preexiſting;
the former muſt, of neceſſity, have flow'd

therefore, which produces out of <hi>nothing,</hi>
makes all the <hi>other</hi> qualities and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Thing, by the notion of <hi>exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence:</hi>
Exiſtence, therefore, is firſt in <hi>execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and, ſince the greater is not made for

                     </p>
                     <p>2. Wherefore, ſince every Agent, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting,
endeavours to expreſſe its own eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
upon the effect; the Eſſence of him
that produces out of nothing muſt be <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence</hi>
it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>3. Nor is it to be expected, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Creature ſhould be made uſe of, as to
preparing the matter; both becauſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
is nobler then all the reſt in a
Thing, whence it admits not of any prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for the reſt, ſince preparations are
only in the baſer in order to a better: as
alſo, becauſe, exiſtence being put, the
Thing is already put: whence, the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon <hi>nothing</hi> is compleat by the very
putting of exiſtence, and conſequently, of
that cauſe alone which puts exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>4. Suppoſing, then, that God has crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
certain Subſtances; and that, becauſe,
of themſelves, they are defectible, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
have that <hi>being</hi> from God; 'tis infer'd,
that God perpetually poures out the
power of <hi>being,</hi> as the Sun <hi>Light.</hi> Imagine,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:115975:170"/>
now, an <hi>accidentall</hi> tranſmutation on Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's
part, (ſuch as is explicated in our
Phyſicall diſcourſe), and, (as 'tis decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
above) through certain changes, an
arrivall to a conſtancy of <hi>being</hi> in another
degree.</p>
                     <p>5. It muſt needs be, that, As, when the
Earth is turn'd to the Sun or Wood laid
on the Fire, from the perpetuall and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutable
action of the Sun or Fire, joyn'd
with the mutability of the Earth and
Wood, ſometimes one ſometimes another
part of the Earth will be enlightned, and
ſometimes one ſometimes another part of
the Wood will burn: So, ſuppoſing that
naturall motions make Matter, in ſeverall
<hi>Sites,</hi> ſometimes capable of a perfecter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence,
ſometimes of a more imperfect;
from the ſame conſtant effuſion of exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
on Gods ſide, the Subſtance muſt
needs be ſometimes nobler, ſometimes
more ignoble, reſpectively.</p>
                     <p>6. Suppoſe, farther, an exiſtent body ſo
chang'd, that the matter may be capable of
a Form which, in its eſſence, includes ſome
notion, that exceeds the power of matter:
is it not plain, that, out of the very ſame
conſtant effuſion of exiſtence from God,
a Subſtance will exiſt which will be, ſo, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:115975:171"/>
that 'twill be, in ſome reſpect, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall?</p>
                     <p>7. For, ſince the putting of exiſtence
puts a Thing; purely at the ſecond cauſes
determinating God to the poſition of ſuch
an exiſtence, not that alone is put, but
whatever follows out of it, though it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the power of ſecond cauſes: And ſo,
it appears, how, putting the generation of
a Man, a rationall Soul is put; and how
the power of nature ſo concurres to it, that
yet the notion of Creation, or rather of
con-creation, ſupervenes, and is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                     <p>8. Laſtly, how it both is and is-not <hi>ex
traduce,</hi> and, at once, by Generation and
Creation; and how, in this caſe, an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in ſome ſort, is made uſe of for
Creation.</p>
                     <p>9. And, becauſe the internall <hi>Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of a Soul, as, to <hi>know</hi> and to <hi>will,</hi> even
they are indiviſible, and follow out of the
materiall impreſſions made upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
it muſt needs be that, as the Soul it
ſelf follows out of the generation of Man,
by the help of the univerſall Action of
God; ſo theſe <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> too, from the
impreſſion made upon the man, and from
the nature of the Soul, muſt indiviſibly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Soul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="317" facs="tcp:115975:171"/>
10. And, whoever would ſee an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
example of theſe things, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how, by <hi>cutting,</hi> a piece of wood is
made <hi>more;</hi> for, all the time of the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the figure is chang'd, yet the wood
remains, by the ſame unity, one; but, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſibly,
the cutting being finiſht, they
are, now, two pieces of wood; without
the dualities beginning at all, before, or
any thing of its nature, but only ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
about the Figure.</p>
                     <p>11. Out of what has been ſaid, we are
deduc'd to ſee, how God performs all the
works of the Creatures in them. For,
firſt, if we ſpeak of Intelligences, Since
their internall operations are nothing
elſe, but to <hi>be</hi> all other things after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
manner; 'tis manifeſt, they <hi>are,</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
even to the uttermoſt poſitive cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
by force of their Creation.</p>
                     <p>12. For, by force of that, their eſſence
is conjoyn'd to it ſelf, as 'tis a cognoſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
vertue; and, out of this conjunction,
the next diviſibility, which is, of God to
the ſame cognoſcitive vertue, ſince all the
cauſes are put, is, of neceſſity, in them.</p>
                     <p>13. And, what is ſaid of this diviſibility
is, with the ſame facilneſſe, diſcover'd of
all the reſt whatever; ſince they are <hi>all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected:</hi>
                        <pb n="318" facs="tcp:115975:172"/>
their externall action, too, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which is its ſubject, being put, follows,
by force of their internall, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
change in them.</p>

locality of Incorporeall Things.</head>
                     <p>1. AS for the reſt, the ſame way leads
to the diſcovery that God is not
the cauſe of any imperfection
and <hi>not-being,</hi> or ill, which is in created
things and their action: For, ſince the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God is only to infuſe Being, and this
as much as the Creature is capable; 'tis
plain, what there is of Being is to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to God, but what ther's wanting of
Being is to be refunded into the incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Subject.</p>
                     <p>2. And, ſince the defect of action pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
out of the defect of the Principle,
that is, out of ſome <hi>not-being</hi> in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
in the ſame manner, all defect in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
is to be reduc'd, likewiſe, into ſome
defect in <hi>being</hi> of the Creature, and not
into God, as its <hi>cauſe.</hi> Wherefore, God is
the Authour of all Good, becauſe all good
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115975:172"/>
is from <hi>being;</hi> but, of no ill, ſince ill is
from <hi>not-being.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Conſequently, 'tis evident, that God
cannot annihilate any thing, or withdraw
his concourſe from the action of any
Creature: For, to be able to annihilate is
to be able to make a <hi>no-Thing;</hi> and, to
withdraw his concourſe is not to give Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to things created; either of which
cannot happen, but from a defect of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and of the overflowing, as it were, of
Being in God.</p>
                     <p>4. You'l ſay, Therefore, God does not
act freely <hi>ad extra,</hi> that is, upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
But,<note place="margin">Leſ. 8.</note> this Conſequence is
to be deny'd; as 'tis ſaid above,
when we treated of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>5. You'l ſay again, In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
therefore, it muſt be ſaid, that God
<hi>cannot</hi> make any thing which He <hi>will not</hi>
make. But, this Conſequence, alſo, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd;
for, his Power is refer'd to <hi>poſsible</hi>
things, or, which have entity and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;
and therefore 'tis not to be deny'd
that he can doe any thing that's poſſible;
though, in another reſpect, it be impoſſible
it ſhould happen that He ſhould, actually,
make <hi>this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. But, the Power of God, which is
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:115975:173"/>
the very notion of Being and Thing, has
not, for its act, the <hi>not-being</hi> of any thing
and <hi>not-acting;</hi> and therefore, 'tis not to be
ſaid, that He can give <hi>not-being,</hi> or can <hi>not-act.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. Let us remember, now, that God
underſtands all and every thing done by
the Creatures, and wills all things which
follow out of his operation; and, we have
it, that God is Governour of the World,
and that there can be no reſiſtance againſt
his Will.</p>
                     <p>8. For, ſince whatever <hi>is</hi> has its birth
from his <hi>will,</hi> nor can there be any thing
which is not effected by Him and His
works; 'tis clear, whatever He <hi>wills</hi> not <hi>is</hi>
not, nor can be ſo long as he <hi>wills</hi> not that
it <hi>be.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. Nor is it leſſe evident, that neither
the <hi>Contingency</hi> of naturall cauſes, nor the
<hi>Liberty</hi> of rationall Creatures is infring'd,
by this government of God. For, ſince
Contingency is nothing elſe, but that the
nature of the cauſe is ſuch that it <hi>may</hi> and
<hi>uſes</hi> to be hindered, by other cauſes; and
Liberty, that a Creature, upon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of <hi>more</hi> proceeds to action: and,
'tis ſo manifeſt, that both theſe are in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and no waies touched by the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God (as that operation is explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:115975:173"/>
that it needs only the remembring:
'tis clear, that the government of God is
<hi>ſweet,</hi> and offers no violence to the natures
of naturall cauſes.</p>
                     <p>10. You'l object, that Propoſitions,
concerning a future, whether contingent
or free, Subject, are <hi>determinately</hi> true; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially,
ſince they are known by God
and are <hi>predefin'd:</hi> wherefore, the effect
cannot not-be: there is, therefore, no ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contingency or liberty; whether this
happens out of the force of Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or of the irrefragable will of God.</p>
                     <p>11. 'Tis anſwer'd, 'tis falſe that Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
concerning a future contingent
have a determinate truth: for, ſince a man
ſpeaks out of conſideration of cauſes, the
Senſe of his propoſition is <hi>What the cauſes
may bear:</hi> Nor imports it, whether it be
pronounc'd actively or paſſively; as if
you ſhould ſay, what the cauſes will act,
or what effect will be made by them; for,
it ſignifies ſtill the ſame.</p>
                     <p>12. If it be, therefore, ask'd, what men
mean by ſuch propoſitions, <hi>'twill rain,
'twill be hot, Socrates will be angry or go to Sea,
&amp;c?</hi> 'tis clear, they mean to explicate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
as in defectible cauſes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
they have no <hi>determinate</hi> truth.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:115975:174"/>
But, if it be ask'd, what the propoſition
will ſignify, if it be referr'd immediately
to the effect, as it ſounds? 'tis anſwer'd,
no ſenſible man uſes to ſpeak ſo or make
ſuch propoſitions; and ſo it belongs not
to the preſent queſtion. But, if there be
ſuppos'd ſuch a power of Contradiction
in the Objects, as to determine the truth
of propoſitions; all things muſt fall out
by the neceſſity of <hi>Fate</hi> and be
from themſelves,<note place="margin">Leſ. 5. n. 9, 10.</note> which is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
ſufficiently demonſtrated
impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>13. 'Tis plain, laſtly, that this action of
God, by which He moves a Creature, is
miſcall'd a <hi>Concourſe;</hi> ſince ſuch a word
leads the hearer into an apprehenſion of a
certain equality in acting, between God
and a Creature: 'Tis, therefore, more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
call'd <hi>premotion</hi> or <hi>predetermination;</hi>
ſince God makes us doe even to every the
leaſt poſitive circumſtance of action.</p>
                     <p>14. 'Tis collected, too, out of what has
been ſaid, how God is ſaid to act in all
things, both by the immediation of his
<hi>Suppoſitum</hi> or Subſtance and of his Vertue;
but, an Intelligence upon one body only
by the immediation of Its Subſtance, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the reſt by the immediation only of Its
vertue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="323" facs="tcp:115975:174"/>
15. For, ſince the action of God is the
influx of Being it ſelf, and nothing can act
without Being, nor Being flow from any
but God; God muſt needs <hi>immediately</hi>
act upon all Subſtances by Creating and
Conſerving them: and conſequently, in
<hi>ſuch</hi> his acting, no third Subſtance inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes
between <hi>Him</hi> and the Creature. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
the action of all bodies proceeding
from Intelligences, and <hi>They being made act</hi>
by God; the vertue of God makes every
thing act, and ſo is more immediate to the
effect then the vertue of the neareſt cauſe:
whence alſo, <hi>God</hi> is, by the immediation of
his vertue, more immediate, then the next
cauſe which produces the action.</p>
                     <p>16. But, an Intelligence, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
rarifies A, moves not B, but by the
mediation of A; the <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> A, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
is between the Intelligence and B;
wherefore, the Intelligence acts not, by
the immediation of Its <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> upon
B: But, becauſe A's being rarify'd is the
cauſe that A moves B; and A is rarify'd by
the vertue of the Intelligence; the vertue
of the Intelligence makes B be mov'd by
A; the vertue, therefore, of the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
not the <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> is immediate
to B.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="324" facs="tcp:115975:175"/>
17. And, hence it follows, that God is
ſaid to be <hi>Immenſe;</hi> but, an Intelligence
to be <hi>definitively in Place:</hi> For, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
either is or can be without Exiſtence,
'tis clear, neither can there be any Place,
upon which God does not, <hi>immediately,</hi> act:
but, an Intelligence, having a <hi>determinate</hi>
proportion to a body, ſo acts upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
quantity, that it cannot, together
and at once, <hi>immediately</hi> act upon another.
Since, therefore, incorporeall Things are
not in Place <hi>circumſcriptively;</hi> an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
muſt be <hi>definitively,</hi> but God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
end, in all Place, by immediate opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>1. TIs clear, too, out of what has been
ſaid, that <hi>this</hi> action of God is the
<hi>conſervation</hi> of things, both as to
their Subſtance, and as to their intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Accidents: For, ſince the eſſence of

conjunction with Being, but ſuch an one
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:115975:175"/>
as may, of its <hi>own</hi> nature, be loſt; 'tis
plain, they are not conjoyn'd, by force of
their own notions, for that time during
which they may be not-conjoyn'd; and,
by conſequence, as long as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd,
they have this, to be conjoyn'd,
from an extrinſecall; they, therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
conjoyn'd by an Extrinſecall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                     <p>2. But, 'tis of the ſame nature, to be
conjoyn'd and to remain conjoyn'd, or,
to be for any duration conjoyn'd; they
have, therefore, this from the ſame cauſe
and vertue: and, ſince 'tis not any change,
but, on the contrary, the effect is that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhould be chang'd; by the very ſame
action, too, they keep their being, which
is, to be conſerv'd. The ſame action of
God, therefore, is Conſervation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Subſtances:<note place="margin">B. 1. Leſ. 5. N. 8, 9.</note> And,
ſince 'tis declar'd above,
that intrinſecall Accidents
are nothing elſe but <hi>manners</hi> of Subſtance;
the Subſtance being conſerv'd, 'tis clear,
that they alſo are conſerv'd in their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>3. Out of what has been ſaid, too, we
may know, what Action ſignifies in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it ſelf: And, if the queſtion be of the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:115975:176"/>
Divine action, as it immediately flows
from God, 'tis plain, that 'Tis the very
Subſtance it ſelf; not only, becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſubjected in a Subſtance, which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
no otherwiſe then by it; nor, becauſe
the exiſtence of Things form'd out of our
conceits is univerſally rejected; but alſo,
becauſe any intermediate action (ſuch as
the Moderns feign <hi>the Making)</hi> which
ſhould be put, ſerves to no purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>4. For, either God, before this action,
is determin'd in himſelf to act, that is, that
this action ſhould follow from Him, or,
He is not; if not, this action will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
for, from an indifferent nothing fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;
but, if He be determin'd, this action
has not the power of determining Him,
for which the Opponent requires it as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary:
but, the effect can, as immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
follow out of Himſelf, as this action.
And, this ſame diſcourſe holds againſt the
like fictitious action, too, of Creatures.</p>
                     <p>5. Again, in as much as the action of
God is Conſervation, 'tis nothing but the
very Being of the thing conſerv'd. For,
firſt, the Duration of an Incorporeall thing
cannot be diviſible; for, if it were diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
'twould be continuate and diviſible
without end: either, therefore, ſome part,

together and at once, in an incorporeall,
that is, indiviſible thing, or not: if toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that part will not include ſucceſſion;
if not, no part can ever <hi>be.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. And, this Argument has not leſſe
force in a Corporeall Creature; for,
though it be diviſible in extenſion, yet,
'tis indiviſible in ſucceſſion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
it cannot ſuſtain together more
parts of ſucceſſive duration.</p>
                     <p>7. Again, if, to <hi>endure</hi> be, for the ſame
thing to be the <hi>ſame</hi> it was; is it not clear,
ther's nothing requir'd but a <hi>non-mutation?</hi>
and, on the other ſide, that, of two things
which exiſt, if one periſh, that's ſaid to be
chang'd; that which endures remaining
ſtill unchang'd? There is, therefore, no
novelty in <hi>permanency.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. Moreover, to change the exiſtence,
the Eſſence, too, muſt needs be chang'd,
ſince, 'tis the <hi>apteſt</hi> capacity of exiſtence:
the notion, therefore, of Subſtance will be
in perpetuall change and inſtable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
out of God, nothing ſtable.</p>
                     <p>9. You'l object, Since 'tis often ſaid,
that a Creature may not-be, and yet,
whilſt it is, it cannot not-be; 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
that its cannot not-be, or, to
be whileſt it is, ſucceſſively ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:115975:177"/>
to a Creature: Since, therefore,
ther's a greater neceſſity of indiviſibility,
on God's part, then on a Creature's; the
ſucceſſion is to be concluded on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſide.</p>
                     <p>10. 'Tis anſwer'd, 'Tis juſt contrary:
for, as, if the action of God were put (by
way of imagination) to be ſucceſſive, no
man would require any other ſucceſſion,
to underſtand the duration of a <hi>Creature;</hi>
ſo, if the action of God be put equivalent
to continually ſucceſſive, no man can
complain of the unintelligibility of Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>11. Becauſe, therefore, the action of
God is conformable to His exiſtence, and
His exiſtence indiviſibly comprehends the
paſt and future; it muſt needs be that the
action, as it is the internall determination
of God, in the ſame manner comprehends
ſucceſſion. This action, therefore, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
the Creature, with a certain indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
that eminentially contains diviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and, without any diviſibility, makes
the exiſtence of a Creature, by contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
impoſſible to be taken away ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively;
yet, without any more then a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
ſucceſſion intervening in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="329" facs="tcp:115975:177"/>
12. For, what has formally the vertue
which is in ſucceſſion, can as well perform
this as ſucceſſion it ſelf: but, ſuch, we have
ſaid, is the action of God: whence, 'tis
plain, that, even from this effect, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods Eternity is demonſtrated
<hi>à poſteriori.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. Hence, 'tis deduc'd, that the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of corporeall and ſpirituall Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
is, intrinſecally different: Since, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall
Subſtances have, from the notion
of Matter, an intrinſecall poſſibility to
not-be; and conſequently, a weaker con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
to Being, intrinſecally, out of
their own nature; but duration conſiſts
in the connection of exiſtence and eſſence,
as to the effect of permanence.</p>
                     <p>14. Adde to this, that there are, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
cauſes which deſtroy Bodies, but,
there are none which are able to infeſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Subſtances: whence, ſince God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes
nothing, of Himſelf, Intelligences
are abſolutely immortall, as alſo, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Souls; and Bodies, when motion cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
will be immortall accidentally, in the
mean time they are ſimply mortall, unleſſe
perhaps there are ſome exempt from the
generall order.</p>
                     <p>15. Out of what has been ſaid, too,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:115975:178"/>
both the notion and difference
of three <hi>Durations</hi> is evident:<note place="margin">B. 2. Leſ. 3. N. 3.</note>

Subject's ſide.</head>
                     <p>1. THe ſolution, alſo, of that old Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is evident, Why God made
not the World before? For, if
we conſider, that ther's no beginning of
an Infinite, and that, where ther's no
beginning, there can be no determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
diſtance from the beginning; it
will appear, that 'tis impoſſible there
ſhould be any eternall flux of Time or
inſtants, (even by imagination), where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there can be taken a <hi>now</hi> and <hi>then,</hi> and
any conſtant difference of duration, or,
ſomething to be <hi>before,</hi> ſomething <hi>after,</hi>
determin'd.</p>
                     <p>2. Wherefore, ſuch a Queſtion proceeds
from the weakneſſe and infirmity of our
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115975:178"/>
underſtanding, and ſignifies nothing; and
conſequently, bears no anſwer: For, for
God to make this world <hi>before,</hi> in time, that
he made it, would be to have made a world
before a world; ſince, the time of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world is nothing elſe but
the very motion, with which the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be mov'd.</p>
                     <p>3. In like manner, evident is the ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that queſtion, Whether God could
make a permanent Thing (that is, whoſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
includes not ſucceſſion) from all <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity?</hi>
For, if there be no quiddity or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of an infinite in ſucceſſion; 'tis
clear, that God could not ſo make a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that it ſhould have Eternity, by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to infinite ſucceſſion: Therefore, not
otherwiſe then by ſome poſitive eminence
confer'd on it: Since, therefore, Duration
conſiſts in the connection of exiſtence to a
Thing, He could no otherwiſe make a
Creature from Eternity, then by giving it
ſuch a connection by which, ſimply, it
could not <hi>not-be,</hi> wherein conſiſts the very
Eternity it ſelf of God. Clearly, therefore,
'tis impoſſible that even a permanent
Thing could have been from Eternity.</p>
                     <p>4. But, as for the <hi>not-immediate</hi> action
of God, or (which is all one) as 'tis
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:115975:179"/>
the ſame with the action of the Creature,
'tis plain, the ſame account is to be given
as of the action of the Creature. And, of
theſe, Philoſophers have pronounc'd, that
Action is ſomething between the Agent
and effect: as, in the change of Place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Reſt in the term <hi>whence</hi> and the
term <hi>whether,</hi> there interven's motion;
which they falſely imagine to be <hi>more</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings-in-place
ſucceſſively, ſince, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
has demonſtrated, all that time the mova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
happens not to be in a place <hi>equall</hi> to it,
whereas, yet, <hi>equality</hi> is of the very notion
of Place.</p>
                     <p>5. So, too, in other mutations, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
that which is call'd Subſtantiall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
the Subject, by the precedent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which properly is the very action, is
not, neither actually nor in part, in the
term it ſelf; but is chang'd only in its
Quality.</p>
                     <p>6. So, too, it falls out in Rarefaction,
which is immediately from an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:
for, ſince the proportion of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
to a Body is finite; It cannot,
inſtantaneouſly, reduce a body to any
how-little-ſoever-a degree of rarity: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
there muſt of neceſſity, between It
prepar'd for action and the term, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:115975:179"/>
ſome motion; during which, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
rarify'd is neither in any determinate
degree of rarity, nor in any determinate
Place.</p>
                     <p>7. Out of all which, this, at length, is
concluded, what a kind of being Paſſion
or mutation has in the Subject: for, ſince
'tis repugnant, the Formall parts in a
Compound ſhould be actuall; they muſt
be only in poſſibility or power, and ſome
other third thing, reſolvable into parts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
exiſt.</p>
                     <p>8. This third thing, therefore, has a
certain reſolvable and changeable nature;
wherefore, 'tis clear, there is ſome cauſe
which has the power of changing it: Let
B, therefore, be the changeable nature, A
the changing cauſe; if A be apply'd to
B, muſt not B, of neceſſity, become ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing then it was, that is, be chang'd?</p>
                     <p>9. This is, therefore, for B to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by means of A, <hi>viz.</hi> to become ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing then it was: <hi>another</hi> thing, I
ſay, or <hi>altered;</hi> for, if nothing perceivable
remain, 'tis become <hi>another</hi> thing; but, if
there remain whereby it may be mark'd to
be this ſame as was before, 'tis only <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,</hi>
becauſe the foundation, or, that
which is the ſuſtainer ſtill remaines,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115975:180"/>
but 'tis innovated in ſome reſpect.</p>
                     <p>10. For example, Let there be a <hi>Gallon</hi>
of water in a <hi>Cubicall</hi> veſſell, and (to avoid
diſpute about a thing that concerns us
not) let's ſuppoſe the Figure to be nothing
elſe, but that that very quantity, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to its three dimenſions, be no farther
extended then, actually, 'tis; (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
being purely negative, can adde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the <hi>quantity):</hi> let the <hi>ſame water,</hi>
then, be ſuppos'd in a veſſell of <hi>another</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;
and conſequently, it ſelf, too, to
have put on other limits: Since the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
terms were nothing but the very
Quantity of the water, neither can the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
differ from it.</p>
                     <p>11. 'Tis evident, therefore, that <hi>this
Quantity,</hi> remaining a <hi>Gallon,</hi> (which
is its difference, whereby, as <hi>quan-tity,</hi>
'tis limited), has a <hi>poſsibility</hi> to be,
now <hi>Pyramidall,</hi> now <hi>Cubicall;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
is changeable, no Thing being
chang'd: To <hi>this poſsibility,</hi> therefore, if
the power of two ſuch veſſells be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
ſucceſſively apply'd; 'tis clear, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the water's and their conjunction,
there follows a change in the Quantity of
the water, by little and little, and, at
length, what in one veſſell was of one fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115975:180"/>
in another becomes of another,
chang'd according to the <hi>manner,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd
according to the <hi>notion</hi> of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</p>
                     <p>12. Thus, <hi>Subſtances</hi> become <hi>altered,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Qualities,</hi> the <hi>Quantity</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd;
according to <hi>Quantity,</hi> the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
unchang'd; according to <hi>Subſtance,</hi>
the <hi>Matter</hi> remaining: for no other
cauſe, but that the <hi>Subject</hi> or that which
ſuffers is <hi>ſo mutable,</hi> and an <hi>Efficient,</hi> which
has the <hi>power</hi> of changing, is apply'd.</p>

without any exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
that, not only the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,
but, even the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Subſiſtence of all bodily Subſtances
is by <hi>continued</hi> ſteps brought from <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility</hi>
to be in <hi>act;</hi> nor can we doubt
that the parts and the whole are of the
ſame nature; 'tis evident, the Beginning
of the Univerſe it ſelf, if we ſuppoſe it
manag'd according to the nature of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
muſt proceed by the ſame rule; that,
from the <hi>neareſt</hi> power and poſſibility in
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:115975:184"/>
which it could be, it has been rip'ned by
<hi>degrees</hi> to this excellent beauty, and did
not by <hi>inſtantaneous</hi> Creation immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtart into perfection.</p>
                     <p>2. Becauſe, therefore, God ſubſiſts by
the very neceſſity of Being it ſelf, and in
Being it ſelf there can be nothing of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,
'tis clear, that His ultimate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall
formality and free act preexiſts
before, not only the exiſtence, but even,
the very eſſence of all and every Creature,
as much as whatever is moſt eſſentiall in
Him.</p>
                     <p>3. As alſo that this Being, which they
have receiv'd from God, is the <hi>nature</hi> of
the Creatures, nor can they otherwiſe
flow from God then according to their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi>
condition. Eſpecially, ſince God
acts not to attain an end prefix'd to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi>
but this is His end, (if we may call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing an end in reſpect of God) that
the Creatures ſhould be, <hi>ſo,</hi> as, in his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
Science and Will, He has <hi>predeſin'd</hi>
their determinate nature fixed and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to be; that the whole Univerſe might
emane His moſt beautifull Image, and, in a
manner, a moſt <hi>adequate</hi> participation of
Himſelf.</p>
                     <p>4. So that, all things that are to have
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:115975:184"/>
their moſt <hi>connaturall</hi> quality, as far as it
can ſtand, <hi>impartially,</hi> with the perfection
of their fellow bodies; this is that which
God will'd, and what, in effect, he has
brought to paſſe.</p>
                     <p>5. Be this, therefore, firmly eſtabliſht,
that God not inſtantaneouſly, but by a
congruous diſpoſition of diverſe <hi>degrees</hi>
brought up the world from its deepeſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility,
that is, its <hi>ſimpleſt</hi> and <hi>feweſt</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
to its due perfection.</p>
                     <p>6. Again, becauſe neither <hi>materia prima</hi>
nor any other part of a Thing, but only
<hi>Phyſicall Compound,</hi> is apt to receive Exia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtence:
and, of Phyſicall Compounds
the moſt ſimple and, as it were, moſt <hi>poten,
tiall,</hi> that is, next above mere poſſibility,
are the <hi>Elements:</hi> and ſomething muſt, of
neceſſity, have flow'd inſtantaneouſly
from God: It follows, that ſome one or
more of the <hi>Elements</hi> were, by <hi>Creation,</hi>
call'd by God out of the common Abyſſe
of nothingneſſe.</p>
                     <p>7. But not one <hi>only</hi> Element was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For, ſince Motion does not follow
out of the ſole vertue of Creation: nor
could Motion be without Diviſion; nor Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
without a Subſtantiall difference of
the divider from the divided; nor this be
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:115975:185"/>
made, even by Angelicall vertue, without
time: it follows that <hi>more</hi> Elements were
created <hi>immediately</hi> by God.</p>
                     <p>8. Yet not <hi>all</hi> the four: Since FIRE
we call <hi>an Element that makes it ſelf be ſeen,</hi>
which implyes Action; but corporeall
action is not without motion; nor moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from pure Creation.</p>
                     <p>9. But, of the other three Elements no
one could be <hi>conveniently</hi> omitted: For
EARTH and WATER are thoſe we
ſee mixt by <hi>Fire</hi> through the whole courſe
of Nature; and Fire is <hi>immediately</hi> genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and nouriſhed by AIRE: If any one
therefore, of theſe three had been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the <hi>matter</hi> had been unfit for Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
operation.</p>
                     <p>10. Three Elements, therefore, were
created; nor thoſe confus'd in a Chaos:
for ſuch a confuſion had not exhibited the
<hi>moſt ſimple</hi> matter, but a diſorder'd multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of mixt things; ſince mixt things
emerge from a <hi>mere</hi> confuſion of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>11. Earth, therefore, was the inmoſt,
as the denſeſt and of conſtant nature: Aire
was the outmoſt, as the moſt oppoſite to
Earth: the middle both Nature and Place
water poſſeſs'd.</p>

                     <p>1. LEt's ſee, now, whether the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
moſt ancient Theology, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
from the Hebrews, ſpeaks
conſonantly to this. <hi>God</hi> (ſaies it) <hi>in the
Beginning created the Heaven and the Earth.
The Beginning,</hi> ſaies, not ſo much a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to things that <hi>follow'd,</hi> ſince it ſelf
was ſomething of what was began; as that
<hi>nothing</hi> was before it. Admirably, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by this term, 'tis expreſs'd, that the
Creation of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> was, ſo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous
and, in a manner, before the
reſt; that neither any Time interven'd,
nor was it ſelf in Time. It ſhews, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that they were <hi>created</hi> out of <hi>nothing;</hi>
and that, <hi>inſtantaneouſly;</hi> and, that the reſt
<hi>immediately</hi> follow'd out of theſe once
put.</p>
                     <p>2. Nor can it be doubted what it calles
<hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> ſince the name of Earth
is immediately us'd afterwards: whence,
'tis evident, that, by the remaining name
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:115975:186"/>
of <hi>Abyſſe,</hi> is expreſs'd what before was
call'd <hi>Heaven;</hi> otherwiſe, the ſacred Text
is confuſed and imperfect.</p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis added, that <hi>the Earth was void
and empty;</hi> according to the Hebrew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<hi>ſolitude and emptineſſe,</hi> or rather, <hi>of
ſolitude and emptineſſe;</hi> for, ſo, the Hebrews
often expreſſe their Adjectives. The ſenſe
is clear, that neither were there men upon
the Earth, whoſe properties are <hi>fellowship</hi>
and <hi>converſation,</hi> the privation whereof
makes <hi>Solitude;</hi> nor Plants and Animals,
which, as <hi>bodies</hi> and <hi>utenſils,</hi> might fill the
place and <hi>houſe</hi> of humane habitation.</p>
                     <p>4. It follows, that <hi>Darkneſſe was upon
the face of the Abyſſe.</hi> The word <hi>Abyſſe,</hi> ſays a
Gulph of waters whoſe bottom is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
or <hi>not reach'd;</hi> and becauſe the
moſt ſimple manner of <hi>reaching</hi> is by
<hi>Sight,</hi> it properly ſignifies ſuch a depth
of water, that Sight cannot reach its bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.
Wherefore, the ſenſe is moſt eaſie,
that, what it had formerly call'd <hi>Heaven</hi> was
a vaſt diaphanous body, upon which there
was no Fire to enlighten it. It affirms,
therefore, directly, that Fire was not <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. But it ſubjoyns two parts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſe,
whilſt it ſays, <hi>and the Spirit of the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:115975:186"/>
Lord was born upon the waters.</hi> Clearly,
therefore, it affirms three Elements,
EARTH, WATER and AIRE,
were <hi>Created</hi> by God; but not FIRE.
And, that they were not confus'd is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
in that, otherwiſe, it had not been an
Abyſſe, that is, a <hi>capacity</hi> of Light, and a
<hi>privation;</hi> ſince by the commixtion of
Earth the other Elements had been rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>opake:</hi> Moreover, <hi>the Spirits</hi> being <hi>born
upon the waters</hi> denotes a diſtinction of
Places between the other two Elements.</p>
                     <p>6. But 'tis obſervable that the word,

wherefore, the Aire <hi>cover</hi>'d the water, but

according to the propriety of the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

what follow'd, by the additional o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
of Creatures. And becauſe the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of <hi>Angels</hi> is no other then <hi>rarefaction:</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>2. And ſince there are many ſorts of
Fire; and that, which, far from the fiery
body, ſmoaks no longer, but ſhoots out
<hi>directly</hi> with <hi>pure</hi> rayes, is, by a ſpeciall

of pure Aire, as, from which no

                     <p>3. Nor is it leſſe certain, this muſt be
done in the very confines of Aire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For, ſince the Angels could not in an
inſtant convert Aire into Light; and a
locall motion of the neighbouring bodies
follows upon rarefaction; the Aire muſt
needs have been mov'd whilſt 'twas yet in
the form of Aire: and ſince motion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without a plurality of Subſtances,
'tis plain that the Aire divided the water;
and conſequently, the firſt Fire was rais'd
in the confines of both.</p>
                     <p>4. Since, therefore, the Fire being
rais'd, of neceſſity, acted upon the water;
it follows, that the Waters being ſtir'd,
thoſe particles to which the Fire ſtuck,
(being rarer then the reſt, and coveting
ſtill a larger place), by their own and the
denſer parts of the Water's motion, muſt
needs be thruſt out into the Aire, which
is more yielding: and thoſe excluded, be
aggregated together, ſpecially towards
the Light, where, by reaſon of the more
vehement action, there muſt needs be

flowing from one ſide then another, (ſince
naturall cauſes work not rigorouſly <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven),</hi>
the whole maſſe of Water, and Earth
adhering to it, by little and little attain a
<hi>motion</hi> towards the ſame Light; ſo that,
<hi>ſucceſsively</hi> and by parts, it rol'd in a <hi>Circle</hi>
and was enlightned, having in ſome places
<hi>Night</hi> in others <hi>Day.</hi>
                     </p>

becauſe the nature of the Elements, by

therefore Light is call'd good or perfect:

                     <p>4. It follows, <hi>And he divided the light from

                     <p>1. FArther, by the operation of this
vaſt Fire, not only the Water, but
much of the Earth, too, with the
Water muſt needs have been rais'd up.
For, <hi>Chymiſts</hi> know that the intenſe heat of
fire can raiſe up and carry away craſſe
Oyls and <hi>Oyntments;</hi> nay even Salts and
very Gold it ſelf. Since, therefore, the
Earth, before the operation of Light, was
diſſolv'd in minuteſt parts and Duſt, as,
void of all Moiſture: it muſt needs be
that the Heat mix'd every where the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with Earth; and thus all <hi>muddy</hi> carry'd
it up into the Aire; but, moſt of all, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thoſe parts over which the Fire <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly</hi>
hung.</p>
                     <p>2. Whence, 'tis plain, two Effects muſt
needs have riſen: one, that the Earth in
that Circle ſhould become more hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and low then in the reſt of its <hi>Superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;</hi>
the other, that the Water, from the
remoter places, ſhould flow into theſe hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſſes:
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:115975:190"/>
whether by the <hi>attraction</hi> of the
Fire; or by naturall <hi>connection;</hi> or by ſome
power of <hi>Gravity,</hi> which, through the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Fire, by little and little, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a force.</p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis plain, therefore, that, ſince the
motion of the Earth was, of neceſſity, by
the greateſt Circle: the Earth, by the
courſe of the foreſaid cauſes, muſt be
drain'd and dry'd firſt about the Poles of
that Circle; and the waters <hi>gathered</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the empty hollowneſſe under that
Circle.</p>
                     <p>4. I ſaid, <hi>by the courſe of the foreſaid cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi>
for, if we conſider what was likely to
be done by accident, this conſequence will
not be univerſally neceſſary. For, 'tis clear,
that the Earth by the boyling of the water,
being <hi>unequally</hi> mixt and remixt, with
continuall agitation; muſt, according to
the law of <hi>contingency,</hi> have produc'd, by
the meeting of different parts, as many
kinds and <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Earths, as we ſee diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
of <hi>Foſsils;</hi> which we divide, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
into four kinds, Stones, Metalls,
Mold, and concrete Iuyces.</p>
                     <p>5. And, ſince, from the varieties, alſo,
of thoſe great parts of that maſſe now tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
with water, a notable <hi>variety</hi> muſt
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:115975:191"/>
needs follow; the Earth, yet cover'd with
Waters, may eaſily here and there have
boyl'd up into <hi>Excreſcencies;</hi> as <hi>Iſlands</hi> have
often grown up in the Sea. By this <hi>irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,</hi>
therefore, ſome Mountains <hi>growing,</hi>
may have appear'd before the Polar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>6. From the ſame principles, it follows,
that the Earth did not appear wholly ſqual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
and deſart, but already impregnated
with the Seeds of all things: nor with Seeds
only, but with <hi>Plants,</hi> too; thoſe eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
which either require or can endure
more moiſture; the reſt, by little and little,
as the dryer Earth grew more apt and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſpos'd for their birth, they, too,
ſprung out.</p>
                     <p>7. And, becauſe an <hi>Animal</hi> is nothing
but a <hi>more-compounded Plant:</hi> by the ſame
reaſon, the Earth, then moſt aptly tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and diſpos'd, brought forth perfect
Animals; as it now being barrener, of its
own accord, produces ſuch as we call <hi>inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta,</hi>
as <hi>Mice</hi> and <hi>Frogs,</hi> and ſometimes new
faſhion'd Animals.</p>
                     <p>8. But, becauſe the waters muſt needs
have been very muddy, even They, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Earth, muſt have ſprung into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
fit to inhabit them; <hi>viz. Fishes,</hi>
                        <pb n="357" facs="tcp:115975:191"/>
ſmall and great; as alſo into certain <hi>middle
Animals,</hi> which might fly up to the higher
parts of the Earth, that is <hi>Birds:</hi> as, even
now, we ſee all kind of Birds that are bred
of Putrefaction, by the Sea ſhores and
Lake's ſides, grow out of the rottenneſſe
of wood tempered with water.</p>
                     <p>9. 'Twas neceſſary, too, that, by the
force of that mighty Flame, parts of Earth
and Water of a vaſt bulk, carry'd up above
the Aire, ſhould, by naturall attraction
and the power of the baking Fire, coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
into <hi>many vast Bodies:</hi> whereof, ſome
ſhould more abound with <hi>fiery</hi> vertue,
and therefore, both conceive and belch
out abundance of Flames; ſo that being
entirely <hi>lucid</hi> they ſhould be apt to <hi>enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>

and method, to be <hi>concocted</hi> and <hi>enlightened</hi>
by Them; and themſelves, too, be able
to <hi>reflect</hi> light from the former to the

                     <p>10. Wherefore, were they ſet &amp; moved

                     <p>1. THe ſacred Commentaries, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
theſe things, tell us thus,
<hi>And God ſaid, let the Waters which
are under the Heaven be gathered together into
one place, and let the dry Land appear.</hi> Here
is the firſt mention made of <hi>gravity,</hi> whoſe
effect is ſaid to be, <hi>to congregate into one
place:</hi> that we may ſee <hi>Gravity</hi> is not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
towards any particular <hi>Site,</hi> but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>unity</hi> of a body; and that it was
made out of the Order of the Univerſe
now <hi>eſtablisht,</hi> after that, between the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
Light and the Earth upon which it
acted, a great diſtance full of Aire was
interpos'd, wherein the motion of things
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:115975:192"/>
aſcending and deſcending might be free.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Iob</hi> 38. 'tis ſaid, that <hi>the Sea flow'd,
as it were, out of a womb;</hi> whence 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
that the Earth throughly moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Water, ſweat out on all ſides, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the lower Vaults, and increas'd the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
where, by the extreme force of the
light, it had been too much ſuck'd out; and
ſo left the Earth in its <hi>due</hi> temperament.
Whence ther's evidenc'd, another cauſe,
too,<note place="margin">Chap. 5. N. 5.</note> beſides what we have expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
of the Earths <hi>appearing,
viz.</hi> becauſe, by the permixtion of
hot water, it ſwel'd into a far greater bulk.</p>
                     <p>3. It follows, <hi>and God call'd the dry, Land,
and the gathering together of the waters he
call'd Seas:</hi> For, it was not <hi>Earth</hi> in the
ſame ſenſe wherein, at the beginning,
'twas ſaid <hi>God created the Heaven and the
Earth;</hi> for, there, the <hi>Element</hi> of Earth was
call'd <hi>Earth,</hi> but here a certain <hi>mixt</hi> body
conſiſting of infinite variety. And, for the
ſame cauſe, he call'd the Firmament, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
for, at the beginning, Heaven ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
Aire and Water in the purity of their
natures; but, here, a <hi>mixt</hi> body made
of the Elevation of the Waters with the
Aire.</p>
                     <p>4. We underſtand farther, becauſe the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:115975:193"/>
waters are commanded to be <hi>congregated
into one place,</hi> and yet the effect is call'd <hi>Seas;</hi>
the waters, which, from that mighty cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall
fire, had contracted <hi>Saltneſſe,</hi> though,
<hi>to appearance,</hi> they poſſeſſe <hi>ſeverall</hi> places,
yet have a communion between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
&amp; <hi>truly</hi> conſtitute <hi>one</hi> place, though
outwardly interrupted: as 'tis evident of
moſt of them, out of Coſmographicall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
                     <p>5. It follows, <hi>And God ſaid, let the Earth
bring forth the green herbs and which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Seed &amp;c.</hi> Whence 'tis underſtood, that
the generation of <hi>Plants</hi> proceeded from
the very ſpringing fecundity of the Earth,
through the activity of ſo much heat; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any extraordinary and miraculous
concourſe of God. For, if, in fifteen daies,
Plants ripen under the <hi>Equator,</hi> which, with
us, require a three moneths ſpace for their
generation; what doubt, but, much more
copiouſly and ſooner they ſtarted out of
the womb of the Earth juſtly tempered by
the operation of Angels?</p>
                     <p>6. Nor need we believe, becauſe the
Plants were perfect, therefore <hi>Oaks</hi> and
ſuch like Trees muſt have been at the full
ſtrength which they attain not under an
intire Age: for, it ſuffices, that the barren
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:115975:193"/>
Trees yielded <hi>Shade</hi> and the fruitfull
their <hi>Fruits,</hi> againſt the <hi>ſixth</hi> Day.</p>
                     <p>6. The Text goes on, <hi>Let there be Lights
in the Firmament of Heaven, and let them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the day and the night.</hi> And, even from
hence, 'tis evident that the office of Light
created the <hi>firſt</hi> day, was to dry the Earth;
which being done, there was no longer
need of ſo mighty a Fire, and therefore
the Angels ceas'd from that operation.</p>
                     <p>8. There appears, again, the difference
between that Light and the Sun: for the
<hi>Sun</hi> is not call'd <hi>light,</hi> but a <hi>light'ner,</hi> as a
Candle or a Torch, wherein one part is
<hi>flame</hi> and another <hi>fuel</hi> of the flame, or that
yields the light. It appears, therefore, that
the SUN is a concrete of combuſtible
matter, and a certain <hi>Vulcanian</hi> Globe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
full of pits vomiting flames: and, that
it receiv'd the office of the former light,
which was <hi>to divide between the day and the
night.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. But, in that 'tis ſaid, <hi>in the firmament
of Heaven</hi> (the Originall expreſſion has it,
<hi>in the expanſion of Heaven,</hi> or <hi>of that whence
the waters)</hi> 'tis evident, theſe lights were
plac'd in the Aire; and that ther's no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of <hi>nature</hi> between the Firmament
wherein the Stars, and that wherein the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:115975:194"/>
Clouds and Birds are, and, conſequently,
that neither are there any <hi>Sphears</hi> in which
the <hi>Fixed</hi> Stars ſhould be, but they are
mov'd as Fiſhes in the water.</p>
                     <p>10. Upon which grounds, 'twill not be
hard to believe them made of Waters
rais'd up out of the Earth; as the 103 or
104 <hi>Pſalm</hi> clearly teaches: For, where our
text has it, <hi>who covers with waters its upper
parts, (viz.</hi> of <hi>Heaven),</hi> the Hebrew has,
<hi>who frameſt its chambers of waters: Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
are lodgings or abiding places aloft;
the Stars therefore (if indeed there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
People in them) are elegantly call'd
the <hi>chambers of Heaven:</hi> and they are ſaid
to be fram'd of <hi>water,</hi> that is, built and
compacted; the watry parts, commixt
with which the terreſtriall were rais'd up,
partly being drain'd into the concavities,
(as we ſaid concerning our Sea), partly
keeping a conſiſtency about the globes to
thicken the Aire, partly remaining in
them, for a due mixtion ſake, according
to the variety of the parts of the Globes.</p>
                     <p>11. But, that the <hi>Angels,</hi> which before
kindled the Light, were divided amongſt
the Stars; eſpecially the Suns (whereof,
'tis evident, there are <hi>many) Iob</hi> ſhews by
thoſe words, when ask'd <hi>where waſt thou
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:115975:194"/>
when the morning Stars marched triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
or, <hi>exulted alike</hi> or <hi>together; and all the
ſons of God ſounded their trumpets?</hi> that is,
when the <hi>morning ſtars</hi> began to be mov'd
(as, in the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 'tis ſaid of the <hi>Sun, he
rouz'd up himſelf as a Giant, to run his courſe),</hi>
that is, ſtars making morning or light; to
which conjoining the <hi>ſons of God,</hi> he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
that each of them had its Angel, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
their firſt motion, as it were ſounding
the Alarm and giving the ſign for motion,
or, making the ſtart and firſt impreſſion.
And this interpretation is beſt accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
both to the Hebrew words and to
the matter whereof He ſpake: and the
word, <hi>together,</hi> ſhews that, in one day they
all began their motion.</p>
                     <p>12. The holy Authour adds the End of
theſe Lights, <hi>that they might be eminent day
and night,</hi> for ſo the originall propriety
has it, where our text ſaies <hi>to rule over;</hi> that
is, that they might be very conſpicuous:
And, <hi>for Signs,</hi> or, according to the force
of the originall word, <hi>Miracles</hi> or Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies;
that is, that they might make men
<hi>admire;</hi> whence by little and little they
might be elevated from terreſtriall things,
to know God and his works, and worſhip
him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="364" facs="tcp:115975:195"/>
13. Laſtly, <hi>for days and years.</hi> Whence,
'tis deduc'd, that the Earth had been <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto</hi>
mov'd only about its <hi>own Centre;</hi>
but, from <hi>thenceforward,</hi> began to be
mov'd under the <hi>Ecliptick; viz.</hi> Becauſe
the motion made by the firſt fire was ſo
violent, that the waters were only drawn
towards the light, or if any mov'd any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, they were ſo few, that they were
in no meaſure able to alter the courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the light: But, the force of the Sun
being far leſſe, did ſo make the Waters
move about the Earth, that yet the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
of the returning Waters was nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
whence the Earth was mov'd about
the Sun in a line mixt, in a manner, of a
Circular and a right.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Some Animadverſions about the
Text of the firſt Chapter of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis.</head>
                     <p>1. FRom the whole <hi>Story</hi> 'tis evident
that our Earth is ſituated in the
very middle of the Univerſe. For,
ſince all the reſt of the World was form'd
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:115975:195"/>
by evaporation from the Globe whereof
our Earth was the Centre; &amp; this, by Fire
intermediate between the Earth &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the World: 'tis evident, that
the reſt of the world is, with a certain <hi>equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
remote from it, and conſequently, that
it is plac'd in the midſt.</p>
                     <p>2. Which I would not have ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
as if the Centre of the Earth were
the very middle point; but, that the
Great Orbe, (that is, all that Orbe, which
the Earth makes with its circle about the
Sun) has the notion of a Centre: for, that
it ſcarce makes a viſible Magnitude, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the reſt of the world, Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
find by experience.</p>
                     <p>3. Adde to this a conjecture from the
<hi>Phaenomena's.</hi> For, the <hi>Zodiack</hi> is fuller of
great and conſpicuous Stars then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the Heavens; as it muſt of
neceſſity have happened, if the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
after the manner we have explicated:
Beſides, of all thoſe Stars which are illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from our Sun, the Earth alone is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
under the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> that is, through
the middle of the very <hi>Zodiack,</hi> to whoſe
courſe the reſt ſeem to yield and give
place.</p>
                     <p>4. In the middle, between the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:115975:196"/>
of Plants and Animals, the Celeſtiall
bodies are reck'ned: becauſe they are
compacted of the craſſeſt evaporations;
and therefore, ought not to be counted,
'till the Earth had already ſhew'd it ſelf,
wherewith the generation of Plants was
conjoyn'd; but, before Animals, becauſe
they are not animated themſelves, but are
only for animated things: And, becauſe
they are adventitious to the Earth, as
helps; before that Animals were created,
but eſpecially <hi>Man,</hi> for whom the Earth
was chiefly made, (who, yet, is but a kind
of Animal, and therefore ought to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
together with the reſt), 'twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
a habitation ſhould be prepar'd,
and conſequently, furniſht with <hi>lights.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. From the ſame order 'tis deduc'd,
that Plants are not ſaid to be animated or
<hi>living,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe as Animals: Since
Animals have in themſelves the principle
of their <hi>encreaſing;</hi> but Plants are fill'd
from without, from the order of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
                     <p>6. Now, three things are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd
concerning the explicated Texts.
Firſt, that <hi>God ſaw all things good,</hi> beſides
the Firmament and Man: the reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is, for the Firmament, that it had only
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:115975:196"/>
the notion of a <hi>Place,</hi> and (the <hi>Stars</hi> not
being yet created) remain'd <hi>imperfect;</hi>
whereas the name of <hi>good</hi> ſignifies <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
but Man was the complement of <hi>all,</hi>
and therefore, not in any ſpeciall regard,
but, looking upon the whole, he's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in this, that <hi>all things were very
good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. The ſecond is, Why God, of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſhould name <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night,</hi> the <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,</hi>
the <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Seas,</hi> and laſtly <hi>Man;</hi>
but none of the reſt? The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
of thoſe things that are made, ſome
belong to the Univerſe as <hi>formall</hi> parts,
that is, without which 'tis no longer a <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe;</hi>
others, as <hi>materiall</hi> parts, which may
be chang'd without the deſtruction of the
Univerſe: the firſt God nam'd, that is, fixt
and <hi>eſtablisht</hi> their nature; the reſt he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
as <hi>mutable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. The third is, Why God bleſs'd only
the Fiſhes, Birds and Man; and not the
Plants nor Animals? The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the bleſſing was <hi>to fill the Earth and
the Sea:</hi> and, if he had commanded the
Trees or Animals to fill the Earth, there
had been no room for Man: Theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were to encreaſe <hi>to ſuch a degree</hi> only;
whence, otherwhere, God ſaid to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:115975:197"/>
that, <hi>by little and little, he would deſtroy
their Enemies, leaſt the Beaſts should be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
againſt them;</hi> and 'tis a ſaying, too, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, concerning domeſtick Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
that <hi>'Tis a good land which nourishes
more Men then Beaſts:</hi> But, becauſe the Sea
was not the habitation of Men, 'twas ſaid
to Fiſhes, that they ſhould multiply with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other meaſure then that of the Sea
it ſelf; and the ſame reaſon is of Birds in
the <hi>Aire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. Farther, we have the reaſon why the
Creation of the World was diſtinguiſht by
<hi>Days.</hi> For, ſince all theſe works were perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by means of fire or the Sun's heat;
and that, not in one <hi>Quarter</hi> only, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the whole globe of the Earth: by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
the whole Orbe of the Earth was
<hi>intirely</hi> turn'd to the Light, whilſt every
thing was made; now, we call a <hi>Day</hi> an <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
converſion</hi> of the Earth to the Sun.</p>
                     <p>10. It appears, too, that theſe days
were unequall. For, ſince the Globe which
was to be turn'd, at the beginning was <hi>vaſt</hi>
(for Water and Earth were created of ſuch
a bulk, that all the Stars might be made
out of them); 'tis plain it was a mighty
Maſſe, and not to be entirely converted to
the light under a long time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="369" facs="tcp:115975:197"/>
11. The firſt three days, therefore,
were very long, and the following ſtill
ſhorter then the former: but the later
three were ſhorter and like ours or little
longer; ſo that an Animal, at leaſt in three
of thoſe days, might be brought to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
bigneſſe, a Fiſh in two; but the
Plants, even before the Earth was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dry'd, already ſprung up.</p>
                     <p>12. But, 'twas neceſſary that thoſe
things which could not be produc'd at the
ſame time and together, ſhould be made
in ſeverall days: wherefore, three days
were aſſign'd for <hi>conſtituting</hi> the orbe, other
three for its <hi>adorning:</hi> and for eſtabliſhing
the Firmament, <hi>viz.</hi> that vehement ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out and elevating of the vapours, the
ſecond day; the firſt having been ſpent in
acquiring, as it were, <hi>velocity;</hi> but the third
day finiſht the work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we might look
upon theſe three days, as it were, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
middle, and end.</p>
                     <p>13. In like manner, becauſe ſome ſpace
was to be allow'd for breeding the Fiſh,
the firſt day is aſſign'd to the Stars; in
which whatever was to be wrought (at leaſt,
in reſpect to us) requir'd nothing but their
being ſhow'n in the Firmament, which is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
perfected in once turning about: And,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:115975:198"/>
becauſe the procreation of the Water is
more abundant and quick, then that of the
Earth; the generation of Fiſhes is plac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that of the Stars and Animals. And
thus, the neceſſity of twice three days is
reſolv'd.</p>

MAN was made: with that capacity of
Body and, particularly, of Brain, which
ſhould be moſt fit to poliſh his life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably
to Nature, according to the

                     <p>3. In a little while, therefore, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

but, when he would have told his thoughts

all which could apprehend or anſwer him.
Falling aſleep, therefore, with much ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude,
God made a WOMAN to ſpring

word, <hi>let us make,</hi> ſignifies a ſpeciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of God and not a generall only, as
to the other things.</p>
                     <p>2. An Image differs from a Similitude,
in that an Image ſpeaks a relation of a
thing either meaſur'd by or deriv'd from
a <hi>pattern;</hi> but, a Similitude neither: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
an Image may be and, for the moſt
part, is of a nature inferiour to its pattern;
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:115975:199"/>
but a Similitude falls ſo far ſhort of the
perfection of a Similitude, as it partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates
of another nature. <hi>Man,</hi> therefore,
was created to the Image of God and to
the Similitude of Angels; according to
that, <hi>and they shall be like the Angels of God,</hi>
and again, <hi>Thou haſt abas'd him a little low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then the Angels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. The Creation of Man is deſcrib'd
thus, <hi>He form'd of the Mud of the Earth;</hi> the
primitive propriety has, <hi>thinking to make,</hi>
or, <hi>to frame as a Potter;</hi> whereby is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd,
that the work of Man was a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
task then that of other Creatures, and
that it ſpecially requir'd the operation of
an <hi>Intelligence.</hi> Where our Text ſays, <hi>of the
Mud of the Earth</hi> in the Originall 'tis, <hi>duſt of
red Earth:</hi> Now, of framable Earths, that
the <hi>red</hi> are the beſt; Pots for Pleaſure made
of them witneſſe, which yield a ſavoury
relliſh to the drinkers: And the force of
the word <hi>Duſt</hi> is, to make us underſtand
the Earth was decocted into minuteſt
parts; for, almoſt in all Arts, the more
the matter is divided, the more exquiſite
the work proves.</p>
                     <p>4. It follows, <hi>And He breath'd into his
Face the breath of life:</hi> in which words,
ther's a clear expreſſion of <hi>another</hi> operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:115975:200"/>
after the forming of his body; to
ſhew that the production of a <hi>Rationall
Soul</hi> does not <hi>adequately</hi> proceed out of
<hi>ſecond cauſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. And the words which follow, <hi>And
Man was made a living Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> ſhew that there
is no other but the rationall <hi>Soul</hi> in Man,
ſince his <hi>vegetation</hi> proceeded out of that.
That there are not, therefore, more <hi>ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi>
Forms in any Matter, appears from
the <hi>propriety</hi> of the ſacred Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>6. Again, the holy Writ ſays, <hi>God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
took the Man, and placed him in a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe
of Pleaſure, to work and keep it: and He
commanded him, ſaying, Of every Tree,</hi> &amp;c.
Though it be not expreſſely taught that
the knowledge of God was infus'd into
Man; yet, in that 'tis ſaid, <hi>He breath'd into
his face,</hi> and again, that <hi>He took him and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him,</hi> 'tis apparent enough, that God
was firſt known to him, and, <hi>by God,</hi> his
ſcience was deriv'd to other things. For,
his firſt object, at the opening his Eyes,
was his <hi>Inſpirer</hi> before his face: Him,
therefore, firſt he knew, ador'd, and lov'd;
and being ſhew'd by Him the Herbs
and Plants, the Beaſts and Birds, he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
both the Vertue &amp; natures of each,
&amp; received them of Him for his own Uſe &amp;
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:115975:200"/>
Service; 'Tis plain, therefore, that he could
not chuſe but <hi>Believe</hi> God's ſayings, <hi>Hope</hi>
in his Promiſes, &amp; <hi>Love</hi> him as his Father.</p>
                     <p>7. That he learnt of God the Vertue of
Herbs and Plants, 'tis evident, out of
thoſe words, <hi>Thou shalt eat of every Tree,
&amp;c.</hi> for, whilſt He puts both an Univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and an exception, he inſinuates that
Adam knew both. Moreover, thoſe words,
where he's ſaid to be plac'd in <hi>Paradiſe, to
work and keep it,</hi> (which he could not doe,
unleſſe he knew the nature of Plants,) ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
that he knew them. Laſtly, ſince 'tis
expreſſely ſaid of the Beaſts and Birds,
that, by only <hi>ſeeing</hi> them, he throughly
ſaw into their nature, in thoſe words, <hi>to ſee
what he would call them,</hi> and again, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Adam call'd any living Soul, that is its
name;</hi> ſince 'tis moſt certain that the names
were fitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the natures of things, and
conſequently, were impos'd upon the
knowledge of them: 'Tis clear that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
natures, too, were as eaſily known
to him.</p>
                     <p>8. The ſacred Authour adds, <hi>But to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
there was not found a helper like him:</hi> the
primitive expreſſion is, <hi>And to the Man he
found not a help as it were before him,</hi> or, as
others explicate, <hi>as it were againſt him.</hi> It
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:115975:201"/>
appears, therefore, that the WOMAN
was made, not out of the <hi>neceſsity</hi> of <hi>nature</hi>
alone, but by the conſent and <hi>will</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi>
God governing Man, <hi>a Reaſonable
Creature,</hi> by perſwaſion and induction, not
by force and command; that is, according
to the nature which he had given him.</p>
                     <p>9. It appears, again, that the Man was
not only in his <hi>Matter,</hi> but even in his
<hi>Mind,</hi> the Authour and Superiour and, as
it were, the Maker of the Woman.</p>
                     <p>10. But, ſince Adam had not yet felt the
<hi>ſtings</hi> of the <hi>Flesh;</hi> neither knew he, as yet,
the need of a Woman, as Woman: but
only he deſir'd one to diſcourſe with, to
whom he might declare his knowledge,
and conferre about his doubts. This is
that which was ſo grievous to the Man,
that God ſaid, <hi>'twas not good for him to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;</hi>
and provided, not only for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
but for ever, that he ſhould have
ſuch as he might teach and converſe with.</p>
                     <p>12. Nor makes it againſt this, that a
Man may ſeem more proper for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of a Man: for 'tis not true, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in regard of his Mind, nor of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
For, 'tis known, that, as to his Body,
a Man chuſes to converſe with the <hi>beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
and Beauty is proper to Women (as
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:115975:201"/>
they are condiſtinguiſht to Men): And,
as for the Mind, a knower chuſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with one that will learn &amp; <hi>acquieſce,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then one that will be refractory; but
Women are more credulous and obedient
then Men: And, in reſpect to both Body
and Mind, the converſation is more ſweet
and agreeable with ſuch as reciprocate
<hi>love;</hi> but Women are more obnoxious to
<hi>love</hi> then Men.</p>
                     <p>12. And that ſhe was requir'd for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi>
the very genuine expreſſion
ſhews, in thoſe words, <hi>a help, as it were, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him:</hi> For, ſince the countenances of
thoſe that talk together are mutually
turn'd <hi>towards</hi> one another; and Man is
made to be mov'd <hi>forward;</hi> it appears, that
the faces of thoſe that diſcourſe together
are, as it were, of entrers by oppoſite and
contrary ways, and conſequently, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
themſelves, according to the ſame line,
are oppoſite and contrary. Such a help,
therefore, was not found amongſt all the
Animals: whence, 'twas ill with Adam.</p>

                     <p>1. <hi>GOd, therefore, caſt</hi> (the holy Text
proceeds) <hi>a ſleep upon Adam:</hi> the
Propriety is, <hi>and He made a ſleep
fall:</hi> for, ſleep begins from the Brain and
the Head, &amp; deſcends upon the reſt of the
Members: as alſo, the Cold of the Night
(which proceeds from Vapours that, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been rais'd up high by the Sun and,
refrigerated by its departure, deſcend) is
a cauſe of ſleep: in both reſpects, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
'tis more aptly expreſs'd <hi>He made fall,</hi>
then <hi>He caſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Moreover, both <hi>Sopor</hi> and the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
word expreſſe a <hi>deep ſleep</hi> and like to a
<hi>Lethargy:</hi> the <hi>Septuagint</hi> interprets it, an
<hi>Ecſtaſy;</hi> which ſo binds up the Senſes,
that the ecſtatick perſon cannot feel any,
under the intenſeſt, pain.</p>
                     <p>3. Now, 'tis eaſie to obſerve, that this
ſleep, at leaſt in part, proceeded from the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:115975:202"/>
former great contention and travail of his
Mind to diſcern the natures of all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
and from his penſiveneſſe that he
found not his comfort or ſatisfaction in
them all.</p>
                     <p>4. Adam lay down, therefore, on his
right ſide: for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches, that this
poſture is the apteſt for ſleeping. And
what did God? <hi>He took</hi> (ſays the holy Writ)
<hi>one of his ribs, and fill'd up Flesh for it:</hi> In the
Hebrew, the Letter is more obſcure, but
thus, with <hi>propriety,</hi> 'tis expreſs'd, <hi>and He
took one of his ſides; and shut up flesh under it;
and built the ſide, which He had taken from the
Man, into a Woman.</hi> The word which we
have expreſs'd by <hi>He took</hi> is very large, and
includes whatever manner of taking, for
example, <hi>to lay hold on;</hi> and the word which
we have interpreted <hi>He shut up,</hi> is taken
largely, too, for <hi>He compaſs'd about:</hi> The
very Letter therefore, in fine, yields this
ſenſe, God took to him one of Adam's
ſides and encompaſs'd it with fleſh, and
built, that is, fram'd or erected it into a
Woman: So that the ſenſe may be, that
God multiply'd the fleſh about one of his
ſides, and the fleſh or ſide already ſwollen
He, by little and little, diſtributed and fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhion'd
into a Woman; ſo that, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:115975:203"/>
may ſeem to have proceeded out of
the Man, as a Bough out of the Trunk.</p>
                     <p>5. For, as the Sun drawing up the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of the Earth into the Trunk fix'd in
the Earth, by <hi>percolation</hi> through the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Trunk, makes the moiſture
aſſume the nature of the Tree, and increaſe
the Trunk, &amp; riſe up and be diſtributed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
parts befitting the intire Plant: So God,
ſtraining that ſleepy humour through the
ſide of Adam, firſt made the ſide ſwell out
with a great deal of fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then be diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into all the ſimilary parts, and laſtly
into the diſſimilary.</p>
                     <p>6. And, beſides that this Senſe is very
apt to the words, nothing is more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the nature of things. For, to the
three degrees of Man, the triple procreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
correſponds; <hi>Adam,</hi> as a <hi>Mixtum,</hi> was
<hi>form'd; Eve,</hi> as a <hi>Plant,</hi> grew out of <hi>Adam;
Abel,</hi> as an <hi>Animal,</hi> was born of <hi>Animals.</hi>
Beſides, reaſon requires, that, ſince in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
there was the next &amp; immediate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Woman, ſhe ſhould not be
made out of any other then that: but, <hi>like</hi>
is made out of <hi>like</hi> by accretion, according
to Nature.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, She is produc'd out of his
<hi>Side,</hi> becauſe ther's both fleſh and bone
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:115975:203"/>
and, through the nearneſſe of the Bowells,
eſpecially of the Heart to the left ſide, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
participates more of the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Vertue then any other member of the
exteriour Cataphragm. <hi>Bringing to,</hi> here,
is, clearly, to be interpreted, not for a <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation</hi>
from <hi>place</hi> to <hi>place;</hi> but, for an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
or <hi>exhibition.</hi> It follows in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Hiſtory, <hi>This, now, is bone of my bones;</hi>
and for, <hi>now,</hi> the Hebrews read <hi>this time:</hi>
The force of both terms is the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi>
that God otherwhiles offered him incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
things; but, <hi>now,</hi> ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,
and naturall.</p>
                     <p>8. Under the name of <hi>Bone</hi> and <hi>Flesh</hi>
the whole Body is underſtood; that is, the
reſt of the ſimilary parts whereof a Man is
compacted.</p>
                     <p>9. <hi>She shall be call'd, &amp;c.</hi> Since <hi>what A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
call'd every living Soul, that is its name,</hi>
the term given the Woman muſt ſignify
the proper notion of <hi>Woman;</hi> which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd,
not from her <hi>Matter,</hi> but from her
<hi>Form</hi> and <hi>End:</hi> how comes, therefore, this
name which Adam impos'd (even himſelf
being witneſſe) to be taken from the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi>
It muſt be ſaid, that thoſe words, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
she is taken out of Man,</hi> do not ſignifie
becauſe ſhe is <hi>made</hi> of Man, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:115975:204"/>
with her to <hi>Lice</hi> and <hi>Fleas;</hi> but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe is of the ſame <hi>nature</hi> with Man.
And, 'tis to be obſerv'd, that the Hebrew
word ſignifies <hi>prince,</hi> or <hi>chief,</hi> or <hi>fundamentall,</hi>
or <hi>ſubſiſtent:</hi> ſo that the ſenſe may be, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
she is of the nature of Man, to excell the
Animals as He himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11. Adam ſays farther, that they ſhould
be <hi>two in one flesh,</hi> or, as the primitive rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
has it, <hi>into one flesh, viz.</hi> three manner
of ways; in the Iſſue, which proceeds from
both; in the Woman, ſince Phyſicians af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that the Seed of the Man diſappears,
being <hi>tranſum'd</hi> into the fleſh of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
and laſtly, by Conſent for Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for, ſince that is <hi>perfect</hi> which is apt
to make its <hi>like,</hi> neither the Man nor the
Woman, without one another, is <hi>perfect;</hi>
both, therefore, as they combine to the
production of their <hi>like,</hi> integrate one,
Phyſically-perfect, Animal.</p>
                     <p>11. Whence, 'tis underſtood, why God
neither ſaid <hi>let Woman be made,</hi> nor, <hi>let us
make Woman;</hi> but, <hi>I will make;</hi> for, ſo, the
truth of the holy language has it: namely,
becauſe the mixtion of the Elements into
Fleſh, which was the proper action of the
Angels, was already done in the forming
of Adam; and the augmentation of that
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:115975:204"/>
exceeded not the power of Adam's nature;
the reſt, therefore, was only the concrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Soul, which belong'd to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>

                     <p>1. THus, Man was entirely perfected:
what misfortunes afterward befell
him let's enquire out of the
<hi>myſticall</hi> Book. It ſays, therefore, <hi>And the
Lord God had planted a Paradiſe of Pleaſure
from the beginning, wherein he put the Man
whom he had formed:</hi> The Hebrews read <hi>a
Garden,</hi> which ſays the ſame thing; but,
what is ſignifi'd by theſe names muſt be
ſought out of the <hi>deſcription.</hi> Firſt of all,
therefore, we are taught, that, <hi>out of the
ground, there was born in it every Tree fair to
ſight and ſweet to eat;</hi> which, from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the <hi>Third day,</hi> 'tis clear, agrees
to the whole Earth.</p>
                     <p>2. The next is, that <hi>the Tree of Life,</hi> and
<hi>the Tree of the Science of Good and evil</hi> (as Eve
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:115975:205"/>
witneſſes) were <hi>in the middle of Paradiſe;</hi>
now, 'tis an Hebrew propriety to ſay <hi>in the
middle,</hi> for that which is <hi>among</hi> or <hi>within:</hi>
The <hi>letter</hi> has it thus, <hi>And God made to ſpring
out of the Earth every Tree, fair to ſight and
ſweet to eat; the Tree alſo, of Life in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of Paradiſe, and the Tree of the Science of
Good and evil:</hi> that is, All kind of Trees
<hi>pleaſant</hi> to <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>taſt;</hi> among which were
good Trees and conducing to life, and
ſome which were apt to make a Man expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
evil things as well as good.</p>
                     <p>3. 'Tis added, that <hi>A river went out from

word is, <hi>out of Pleaſure; to water
Paradiſe, &amp; thence 'tis divided into four heads;</hi>
in the Hebrew, <hi>and from there</hi> (that is, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

ſprung in four heads or great Rivers: for
'tis incongruous that one river divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <p>4. And what is here call'd <hi>fertility</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,</hi>
is deſcrib'd to have agreed to the
whole Earth, at that time; it being ſaid,
that <hi>a Fountain aſcended out of the Earth, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
the whole ſuperficies</hi> of the Earth:
Where, the native Text, in ſtead of <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
has <hi>a Vapour;</hi> whereof the <hi>Book of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
ſeems to ſpeak, when it ſaies that <hi>She

ſtand upon the Mountains.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. An example, too, of ſuch like we
have in ſome very hot and moiſt regions;
in one of the <hi>Canaries,</hi> in the Iſland of
<hi>Saint Thomas,</hi> and ſome others; that there
iſſues a Vapour out of the Earth, which
being refrigerated with the ſhadow of the

                     <p>6. But, now, the enumeration of the
Rivers makes the matter manifeſt: for it
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:115975:206"/>
takes the four greateſt Rivers known to

of God to Adam, and not a locall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
as, before, 'tis ſaid of the word <hi>He
brought.</hi> But 'tis ſaid above to Adam, that
<hi>he should take the Earth for his matter to work
on, and fill it:</hi> We have it, therefore, that
the Garden which Adam was to <hi>cultivate</hi>
and <hi>inhabite,</hi> is the ſame which he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to <hi>fill</hi> and <hi>ſubject;</hi> and whereof 'tis
ſaid that, <hi>as yet, there was not the Man to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
it, but a Vapour aſcended and watred its
univerſall ſuperficies.</hi> Adde to theſe, that the
whole Earth was <hi>curſed;</hi> that the whole, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the curſe, was created for Adam and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:115975:206"/>
his Iſſue; which, in a <hi>Garden</hi> only, could
not have had room enough.</p>
                     <p>8. Conſider the honour of <hi>Huſbandry:</hi>
both that, of all the <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> 'tis the work
that's moſt proper to mankind: and 'tis a
<hi>keeping</hi> or preſerving of the Earth; for
the Earth grows better by cultivation, but
uncultivated it grows barren &amp;, as it were,
<hi>perishes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. Beſides this precept, God added an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

FALL, out of Geneſis.</head>
                     <p>1. THe divine Authour begins the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Hiſtory, ſaying, <hi>Moreover,
the Serpent was more crafty then all the living
Creatures</hi> of the Earth: the word which
correſponds to <hi>Serpent,</hi> in the originall, is
deriv'd from a Verb which ſignifies <hi>to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi>
or <hi>to pry into ſecrets;</hi> wherefore, <hi>à pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori,</hi>
it ſignifies, an <hi>Obſerver,</hi> a <hi>lier in wait</hi>
and what in the Goſpell, the <hi>Tempter:</hi> and
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:115975:207"/>
where the Latine Interpreter puts <hi>all living
Creatures,</hi> the ſacred Authour uſes a very
large word which comprehends <hi>Man</hi> too:
So that the ſenſe may be, the <hi>Tempter</hi> was
craftier even then <hi>Man</hi> himſelf; as, alſo, it
appear'd by the event.</p>
                     <p>2. He came, therefore, to the Woman
and ſaid, <hi>Why has God commanded you, &amp;c.</hi>
in the originall letter, <hi>even that God has ſaid:</hi>
as if it ſhould ſay, <hi>was it not enough for God
to have oblig'd you to keep his Garden, but even
muſt he not-permit you to eat?</hi> To whom the
Woman anſwer'd, <hi>Yes, we do eat of the rest,
but should we eat of the Tree of the Knowledge
of good and evil, we should die.</hi> 'Tis evident,
therefore, this command was given by
God, not as out of <hi>power</hi> and <hi>prerogative,</hi>
but for the <hi>good</hi> of thoſe to whom 'twas gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and Man is govern'd by God alwaies
for the good of Man himſelf.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>The</hi> Tempter <hi>therefore reply's again,</hi>
You shall not die, but you shall be like Gods: <hi>the
Analogy of the</hi> two Temptations <hi>is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
Say that theſe ſtones be made bread, <hi>and,</hi>
He forbids you to Eat: He has commanded his
Angels concerning thee, <hi>and,</hi> Ye shall not die:
<hi>laſtly,</hi> All theſe will I give thee, <hi>and,</hi> Ye shall be
like Gods.</p>
                     <p>4. 'Tis added, <hi>The woman, therefore, ſaw
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:115975:207"/>
that the Tree was good to eat, and fair and
delightfull to behold, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Tree</hi> is put
for the <hi>Apple;</hi> or, certainly, in reſpect of
the <hi>Apple,</hi> theſe things agreed to it. And
whereas 'tis ſaid, <hi>she ſaw</hi> the apple to be
ſweet to the taſt, or <hi>good for food,</hi> as the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
reading has it; it argues that the
Woman, too, to ſome degree, from the
<hi>ſight</hi> of Plants, eſpecially the earneſt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on them, knew their natures. And the
Authour, inſtead of this, <hi>delightfull to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi>
has, <hi>deſir'd to look earneſtly upon,</hi> or, <hi>to
underſtand;</hi> and the ſenſe is, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſaw her Appetite ſo to have encreas'd,
that ſhe could not turn away her Eyes: Or
elſe the word <hi>ſaw</hi> ſignifies <hi>conſider'd;</hi> and
the ſenſe will be, She conſider'd that the
Apple was deſirable for the Knowledge
that would follow it, upon the Tempter's
words.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>The Woman, therefore, eat, and gave,
too, to the Man;</hi> who was not <hi>deceiv'd,</hi> that
is, did not eat upon a falſe perſwaſion, but,
as 'tis ſubjoyn'd, <hi>obey'd the voice of his wife:</hi>
For, alas! he was effeminate, and durſt
not, through exceſſe of love, oppoſe his
Wife.</p>
                     <p>6. 'Tis collected out of the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that the <hi>Tempter</hi> or <hi>lier-in-wait</hi> had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:115975:208"/>
the Woman abſent from her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
near the forbidden Tree, at the hour
when her Appetite to eat made way for his
treacheries.</p>
                     <p>7. But, let us ſee the effect. The ſacred
Text, therefore, ſaies, that <hi>the eyes of them
both were opened and they knew they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi>
But 'tis plain that, not preſently upon
their eating, but after ſome time (ſuppoſe,
when, by concoction, the poiſon of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was digeſted into their bowells,) this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
happened: for, if, immediately as ſoon
as the Woman had eaten, her eyes had
been opened, ſhe would have bluſht and
not dar'd to appear before her Huſband;
or, at leaſt, being ſollicitous and troubled
about the change ſhe felt, ſhe would have
told it him.</p>
                     <p>8. But, how their eyes were opened and
how they knew themſelves to be naked,
appears by the following action, that <hi>they
made themſelves aprons</hi> or girdles, to cover
with them the parts deſtin'd for generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Evident, therefore, 'tis that, by their
eating the Apple, their fleſh roſe and was
mov'd without their conſent. The effect,
therefore, of the Apple was immediately
to provoke <hi>Luſt;</hi> &amp;, through the <hi>intoxicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as it were, of <hi>luxury,</hi> to ſhake off the uſe
or command of <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="391" facs="tcp:115975:208"/>
9. The very deſcription, too, of the
Fruit inſinuates it to have this vertue. For,
Phyſicians ſay that ſweet is <hi>primely</hi> nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
as conſiſting of hot and moiſt conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
to the Animal; and that, whatever
nouriſhes does it, in as much as 'tis <hi>ſweet:
Good,</hi> therefore, <hi>for food</hi> (when 'tis ſpoken
by way of <hi>eminency)</hi> is, what is <hi>very nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi>
but Seed is made of the <hi>ſuperfluity</hi> of
the nouriſhment: <hi>Good,</hi> therefore, <hi>to the
taſt,</hi> or, <hi>for food,</hi> ſhews it was provokative of
<hi>luſt.</hi> The ſplendour, too, of <hi>colour,</hi> ſince it
proceeds out of a good commixtion of
ſubtle and oily parts, is apt to follow the
<hi>ſweetneſſe.</hi>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Punishment of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents:
out of the ſame.</head>
                     <p>1. IT follows in the Hiſtory, <hi>And when
they had heard the voice of the Lord God
walking in Paradiſe, at the cool, after
noon;</hi> The Hebrew ſaies, <hi>when they had
heard the noiſe of him coming into the garden
at the aſpiring of the day,</hi> or day-break: and
the ſenſe is, that God, in the Morning, with
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:115975:209"/>
the cool aire which goes before or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
the Sun, came into the Garden;
namely, to be ador'd by Adam: whence,
when Adam appear'd not, but had <hi>hidden</hi>
himſelf <hi>in the middle of the Trees of Paradiſe,</hi>
that is, among the Trees, which were very
thick, <hi>He call'd</hi> him. And this ſenſe ſeems
the better: for, what could be the end why
God ſhould appear a-walking? beſides,
that the <hi>cool of the day</hi> is better underſtood
the <hi>Morning</hi> then the <hi>Evening;</hi> whence, in
the <hi>Canticles,</hi> 'tis ſaid of the Morning, <hi>'Till
the day aſpire and the shadows be inclin'd:</hi>
for, not that which is done by the day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring,
but what the day brings along with
it, is properly attributed to the Day.</p>
                     <p>2. 'Tis added, how God <hi>examin'd</hi> Adam
and Eve; but He puniſht the Tempter
without an <hi>examen,</hi> as being a profeſs'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
and of a known malice. The firſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
is, that He ſhould <hi>be curſed of all
living Creatures;</hi> for ſo, the primitive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
has it, not <hi>among living Creatures.</hi>
The ſecond the Latine Interpreter puts to
be, <hi>thou shalt go upon thy breaſt:</hi> but the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
word derives from a verb which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<hi>to ſigh,</hi> or, <hi>to burſt out, as it were, the
iſſue out of one in travail;</hi> ſo that, the ſenſe
may be, In ſighing and grief as of one in
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:115975:209"/>
travail, that is, <hi>Thy whole life and all thy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
shall be full of grief and pain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. The third is, <hi>Thou shalt eat Earth,</hi> but
the Hebrew ſaies, <hi>thou shalt deſtroy Duſt all
the daies of thy life;</hi> which ſeems the better;
for Serpents corrupt the Earth with their
breath, but do not eat it, that I ever read.
Nor hinders it, that, in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> we read, <hi>To
the Serpent duſt is his bread:</hi> for, That was
not to be <hi>in the holy Mountain,</hi> which was the
effect of <hi>Malediction:</hi> Better, therefore, 'tis
explicated, <hi>to the Serpent ashes to warm him;</hi>
that is, the Serpent ſhall be no longer an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to Man, but ſhall dwell in the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
(as <hi>'tis</hi> read of ſome domeſticall ones);
whence, 'tis immediately ſubjoyn'd, <hi>They
shall not hurt nor kill in all my holy Mountain.</hi>
In the text of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the ſame word is put
for <hi>duſt</hi> which was in the forming of <hi>Man:</hi>
that the ſenſe may be, <hi>Thy deſign shall not be
againſt Angels, like thy ſelf; but how thou
maiſt undoe ſuch as are made of Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Out of what has been ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Tempter,</hi> it appears, ther's no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of interpreting that the Devil
ſhould have come to the Woman by the
means of a <hi>reall</hi> Serpent, or in the <hi>figure</hi> of
a Serpent; but in a form like that, in which
he came to <hi>our Lord Chriſt:</hi> For, firſt, moſt
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:115975:210"/>
of the things that are ſaid agree not to a
reall Serpent; <hi>viz.</hi> to be <hi>craftier</hi> then any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Creature; to be able to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
frighting the woman; to ſpeak not
of things they <hi>ſaw,</hi> but of Gods.</p>
                     <p>5. Again, his being curſed of all living
Creatures, his being curſt to eat Earth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
not to a reall Serpent: and that one
only thing which agrees, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>go in upon
his breaſt;</hi> ſince 'tis a naturall manner of
<hi>creeping,</hi> was had by Creation. Wherefore,
the opinion of a Serpent or a Serpent's fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
ſeems to have proceeded from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation
of the Hebrew word, or, a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphoricall
uſe of a Serpent for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
                     <p>6. The following <hi>Propheſy,</hi> too, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the Devil, not a Serpent: For a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
is no more an <hi>enemy</hi> to Man then to
the other Animals; but the Devil is to
<hi>Chriſt;</hi> and he <hi>bruiſes the heel</hi> of Chriſt, in
as much as he debauches and maſters the
loweſt rank of Chriſtians, or the wicked;
<hi>Chriſt</hi> too, <hi>breaks his head,</hi> both becauſe <hi>He</hi>
is to <hi>judge the Angels,</hi> as alſo becauſe He
takes away the power the Devil has in the
world.</p>
                     <p>7. There follow, the Evils which ſeize
on the Woman through ſin; that <hi>She should
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:115975:210"/>
have more and harder labours;</hi> that <hi>She should
be under the power of her huſband, and be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
by him.</hi> And, that this violent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
proceeds from ſin, is plain enough;
ſince it riſes from the indiſcretion of both
parties: <hi>Bringing forth,</hi> alſo, with <hi>pain,</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
proceeds from the ſame; for, even
yet, many Women under the <hi>Aequator,</hi>
bring forth with little or no pain: now,
the pain in Travail comes through the
dryneſſe of the members, by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Bone cannot give place, which is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
conjectured to proceed from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperateneſſe
of the Aire and of Meats.</p>
                     <p>8. Laſtly, that her <hi>Conceptions</hi> are <hi>more</hi>
is manifeſt, in reſpect of Abortions and
imperfect Conceptions: but, whether
through the intemperancy of Copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
or the ſhortneſſe of the time of going
with child, which, may be, ſhould have
been longer; and laſtly, whether, becauſe
in the immortall ſtate of Paradiſe there
ſhould not have been requiſite ſo copious
an Iſſue, therefore the Conceptions ſhould
have been fewer, 'tis diſputable.</p>
                     <p>9. Among the <hi>maledictions</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> the
reſt appear plainly to proceed from the
sterility of the Earth; but this, that <hi>he
should eat the herb of the field,</hi> ſeems, from
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:115975:211"/>
the beginning, to have been indulg'd him
as a bleſſing, &amp; here 'tis reputed amongſt
his puniſhments: But, the ſenſe is, that he
ſhould be compell'd to lay up in <hi>Barns</hi> the
<hi>herbs</hi> of the <hi>field</hi> to eat; becauſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
the Earth ſhould yield none.</p>
                     <p>10. Moreover, thoſe words, <hi>'till thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneſt
into the Earth out of which thou art ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
&amp;c.</hi> clearly ſhew that he ſhould have
been immortall; that is, have liv'd a long
time, and afterwards, not be deveſted but
<hi>cloathed-over,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.</p>
                     <p>11. It follows, how he was caſt out of
Paradiſe; and 'tis ſaid, that, Adam being
caſt out, <hi>God plac'd, before the Paradiſe of
Pleaſure, a Cherubim &amp; a flaming and turning
ſword, to keep the way of the Tree of life.</hi> To
underſtand which, we muſt reflect upon
the univerſall cauſe of the Corruption of
all things, eſpecially of Living Creatures.
And, becauſe Animals are cold in death,
'tis plain, that <hi>Cold</hi> is the cauſe of Death;
whence, we ſee, that <hi>Winter</hi> is, as it were,
the old Age of the Year, The years, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
had continu'd in one ſtate of heat
and cold in Paradiſe; and to introduce
Winter, is to make life ſhorter, &amp; to have
brought Death nearer.</p>
                     <p>12, The cauſe, therefore, of the <hi>variety</hi>
                        <pb n="397" facs="tcp:115975:211"/>
of the year is the cauſe of <hi>Death:</hi> and this,
Aſtronomers teach, happens, becauſe the
Earth keeps not ſtill its ſame parts to the
Sun, or in that it conforms not its <hi>Axis</hi> to
the <hi>Axis</hi> of the Ecliptick, but alwaies turns
it from the Poles of the Ecliptick to the
<hi>Poles</hi> of the <hi>Aequator;</hi> &amp; this, Naturaliſts
teach us, happens through that motion, by
which the Flux of the Sea turns the Earth;
and, the Flux of the Sea, from a Wind which
the Sun under the <hi>Aequator</hi> raiſes.</p>
                     <p>13. Let's ſee what the ſacred monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
expreſſe concerning this: Firſt,
therefore, They ſay, that which was to be
done was, <hi>therefore,</hi> done, <hi>leaſt, perhaps, he
should reach out his hand and take of the Tree
of Life, and eat, and live a full age,</hi> or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years: whence, 'tis evident, that the
vertue of the Tree of Life was not wholy
to exempt from Death, but to deferre it
and make to live <hi>in ſeculum,</hi> that is, a long
time; which vertue ther's no doubt is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away by the empairing of the Fruits.</p>
                     <p>14. Then, that which our tranſlation
ſaies <hi>before Paradiſe,</hi> others render <hi>from the
Eaſt to Paradiſe.</hi> If, therefore, (as we have
ſaid) the whole Earth was Paradiſe, and
the motion of the Earth proceeds from
the Sun, the cauſe of the converſion of the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:115975:212"/>
Earth is from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and, to be <hi>from the
Eaſt</hi> is, to be <hi>before</hi> the Earth and <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
Moreover, that which ours renders <hi>a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim
and a flaming and turning ſword,</hi> in the
originall is <hi>a Cherubim &amp; the edge of a ſword
turning it ſelf.</hi> The one Phraſe ſhews that
the force of Death proceeded from a <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim</hi>
by <hi>flames</hi> and <hi>fire;</hi> and the other, by
<hi>turning:</hi> Now, that the Sun's motion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from a <hi>Cherubim</hi> or an Angel, <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicks</hi>
demonſtrate: If, therefore, that
winding of the terreſtriall <hi>Axis</hi> to the Poles
of the <hi>Aequator,</hi> be deriv'd from the Sun;
and, from that, the nature of Death, by the
<hi>variation</hi> of light and heat; is it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
(if a <hi>ſword</hi> may ſignifie a <hi>killing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)</hi>
how a <hi>Cherubim,</hi> with a <hi>flaming</hi> and <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſword,</hi> keeps the <hi>way</hi> to the <hi>Tree of life,</hi>
leaſt <hi>Man</hi> ſhould <hi>live</hi> by it <hi>a full age.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15. And, he that thinks this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of a <hi>ſword</hi> for a <hi>killing power,</hi> too
hard; let him remember the Angel, in <hi>the
threshing floor of Ornam,</hi> holding a drawn
ſword to bring the Plague upon Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.
Let him conſider, alſo, if the name of
Sword be taken materially, how diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
the narration will be: for, the Angel
ſhould have been plac'd, not from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi>
or, <hi>before Paradiſe,</hi> but round about: nor
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:115975:212"/>
would there be any need of a <hi>turning ſword,</hi>
but of a ſharp one; for, the Angel could
have turn'd it, as he pleas'd.</p>
                     <p>16. Laſtly, the <hi>cloathing</hi> of Adam and
his wife with Coats made of <hi>skins,</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
inſinuates that the Cold grew upon
them; the Year, as it were, now inclining
towards <hi>Winter:</hi> whence, it ſeems, 'twas
<hi>Autumn</hi> in that Region where Adam was
created. Yet, 'tis not neceſſary, that God
muſt have given them thoſe Coats of skins
immediately upon the malediction, but
after ſome time; when, having done Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
they had ſacrific'd Beaſts to God:
with whoſe skins God cover'd them, not ſo
much for their <hi>nakcdneſſe</hi> ſake, which was
cover'd with <hi>Aprons,</hi> as for the Colds, and
therefore they were made of <hi>skins</hi> with
which Beaſts are kept warm.</p>

                     <p>1. NOne doubts, nor can, according to
what we have ſaid, but this ſtate of
infelicity and Death is deriv'd to us, the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:115975:213"/>
Poſterity of Adam, from <hi>his Sin:</hi> but, what
evil or corruption we derive, as to the
<hi>Mind,</hi> 'tis to be conſider'd. And, firſt, 'tis
evident, that the Underſtanding of Adam
was moſt happy; which ſo eaſily attain'd
the knowledge of things, that, at firſt
ſight, he could impoſe ſignificant names
upon every one.</p>
                     <p>2. Which is not ſo to be underſtood,
that he perfectly ſaw through all things:
for, from the deceipt of Eve, and both
their <hi>hiding</hi> themſelves from the face of
God, 'tis clear, their diſcourſe was ſhort
and imperfect at that time. Nor, is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
that they loſt their <hi>naturall</hi> force:
wherefore, by <hi>nature,</hi> their underſtanding
was ſo hinderable by <hi>Paſsion,</hi> as to bring
them to ſuch Inconſideration.</p>
                     <p>3. But, we read, too, that they were <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi>
and <hi>blusht not</hi> before their Sin, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards:
whence, we underſtand, there
were before no <hi>inordinate</hi> Motions in them,
ſince, in <hi>luſt,</hi> the moſt vehement kind, they
had none.</p>
                     <p>4. Now, for Man to have <hi>no inordinate</hi>
Motions in him, may happen two waies:
One, that we ſhould aſſert there <hi>were</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>ſuch</hi> Motions, but, as it were, rooted
out by a long uſe and exerciſe of Vertues:
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:115975:213"/>
another way, that we ſhould imagine his
nature ſo temperate and <hi>equally</hi> ballanc'd
between Paſſions; that it ſhould ſubmit
it ſelf intirely to Reaſon, out of its <hi>own</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quability,
and not out of an <hi>acquir'd</hi> domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>5. And, ſince God might have created
Man in the perfection of either of theſe;
if we conſider the circumſtance of the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of nature, we ſhall rather aſſent to
the later deſcription: for the former ſtate
is of one already proceeded from <hi>power</hi> to
<hi>act;</hi> but this later is a certain <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiality,</hi>
or of Man, as to his Soul, exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
in <hi>power: that,</hi> the ſtate of Man grown
good, of evil that he was; <hi>this,</hi> of Man
not yet knowing good and evil, or, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught
by experience: To <hi>that</hi> Man 'tis
now hard to Sin, and <hi>certain</hi> that <hi>he will not
be ſeparated from the love of Chriſt;</hi> to <hi>this,</hi>
'tis eaſie not-to-ſin, but Sin is rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to him then hard, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
his <hi>entrance</hi> to good or evil is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
<hi>That</hi> ſtate is more eſtabliſht in the
Brain through the exerciſe of Reaſon;
<hi>this</hi> more in the Body, through the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of its Temperature; whence, <hi>this</hi> is
more propagable to his Iſſue, though <hi>that</hi>
be ſo, too, in ſome degree.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="402" facs="tcp:115975:214"/>
6. Since, therefore, Philoſophy tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
that even that complexion of nature,
which riſes from acquir'd habits and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
is apt to be deriv'd to the Iſſue; much
more that, which was by Nature planted in
Adam, would have paſs'd into his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
His Children, therefore, had he not
ſin'd, would have attain'd, from their <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi>
a certain equability of Paſſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they would have grown <hi>eaſily</hi> obedient
to Reaſon; or rather, they would have
had no paſſion more vehement then was
juſt fit, ſo that they would have felt no
difficulty in following right Reaſon: from
which diſpoſition he ſeems not to have
<hi>St. Bernard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> been far, of whom 'tis wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſaid, that <hi>Adam, in him, had not ſin'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. Whence, the perverſe motion of the
will in our firſt Parents, was apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
only from <hi>extrinſecall</hi> ſollicitation:
So, we ſee, in the anſwer of Eve, that ſhe
was content with the command; 'till the
Devil, propoſing a ſhew of fallacious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which ſhe could not ſee through, had
<hi>faſtened,</hi> as it were, her mind to the delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
form of the Apple before her; by which
<hi>faſtening,</hi> that naturall equality was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted:
which, too, in like manner, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to Adam, through his amorous <hi>fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe</hi>
                        <pb n="403" facs="tcp:115975:214"/>
to his wife; as may be collected out
of his words, wherein ther's no praiſing of
God the giver, but only a commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the lovelineſſe of the woman. 'Tis
evident, therefore, that the <hi>naturall</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of motion and paſſion were corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in both our Parents; and ſo, in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
an <hi>inequality</hi> was deriv'd to their
iſſue: not one <hi>equall</hi> to Theirs, but one
far greater; it being now corrupted from
the change of ſite to the Heavens, and the
quality of the Aire and Food: and ſo, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably
their Poſterity drew from the
Womb of their Mother an <hi>Origin</hi> or <hi>incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
to ſin.</p>
                     <p>8. Which <hi>negation</hi> of equability, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis in a ſubject to which an equality
is due by its Creation, attains the nature
of a <hi>privation:</hi> and, becauſe the guilt of
Adam is in it, or, becauſe we derive our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin
from him, 'tis, therefore, call'd O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIGINAL,
not formall, SIN: and,
becauſe 'tis impoſſible that Man, infected
with this, can live without ſin, by the
ſtrength of nature &amp; without new <hi>Grace;</hi>
therefore <hi>Nature</hi> is call'd the <hi>Slave of Sin,</hi>
and <hi>given up into ſlavery to the Devil.</hi> But,
whether Originall ſin comprehends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
an <hi>indiſpoſition</hi> of the <hi>ſenſitive</hi> Soul, a
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:115975:215"/>
                        <hi>privation</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> conſequent from it, in
the Iſſue, (becauſe ther's nothing offer'd
out of our text, ſpoken concerning that
matter) I leave to the curious.</p>
                     <p>9. It ſuffices us that, out of what has
been ſaid, it may be underſtood, how <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
Sin</hi> is <hi>ſingular</hi> in every one, how 'tis
<hi>deriv'd</hi> by <hi>Generation,</hi> and how it <hi>proceeds</hi>
from the fault of <hi>another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. Of theſe things that have been ſaid,
I know not whether we have not, in ſome
meaſure, an Example in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel:
Cain</hi> being conceiv'd in Sin, (perhaps, the
very night after eating the forbidden
fruit, before God, by puniſhment, had
provok'd them to Penance); <hi>Abel,</hi> in the
time of Penance: whence, <hi>Cain</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
in the conception, his Mothers envy
againſt God; <hi>Abel</hi> her humility and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
wherefore, what our Interpreter ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<hi>I have poſſeſt a Man by God,</hi> may be
more truly tranſlated, <hi>I have loved a Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God.</hi>

                     <p>1. AFter the Death of his Brother,
<hi>Cain</hi> departed into the barrener
parts (as appears, from his <hi>Curſe):</hi>
And, this was the firſt occaſion of filling
the ſeverall <hi>quarters</hi> of the Earth. And, he
is ſaid to have <hi>ſojourn'd towards the Eaſt from
Eden;</hi> or rather, towards the Weſt, for
the originall letter has it, <hi>he ſat down in a
ſtrange Country before Eden,</hi> that is, he dwelt
in a far Country <hi>before Eden,</hi> that is, to
which the face of <hi>Eden</hi> is turn'd, (Adam
and his Family being ſuppos'd to look <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
him when he went from them), that
is, to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> or, having <hi>Eden Eaſtward.</hi>
Now <hi>Eden</hi> ſeems to be call'd that Country
in which Adam dwelt, in memory of the
Pleaſure he had there.</p>
                     <p>2. And the ſacred Authour proſecutes
the <hi>Generations</hi> of <hi>Cain</hi> to the <hi>ſeventh</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent;
and tels us the <hi>Cities</hi> that were built,
and the <hi>Arts</hi> both for uſe and pleaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
in them. But, how many years each
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:115975:216"/>
generation contain'd, he mentions not:
but, 'tis likely, they were ſhorter then the
generations aſſign'd to <hi>Seth;</hi> whence, in
the time of <hi>Enos</hi> (which extends to about
a thouſand years after the nativity of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch,</hi>
the firſt-born of Cain) the children
of Adam, on Cain's ſide, may have been
<hi>exceedingly</hi> multiply'd, and that hap'ned
which is written, that, in his time, <hi>The invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the name of the Lord was polluted, viz.</hi>
in moſt of the poſterity of Seth and Adam,
through their <hi>Marriages</hi> with the <hi>daughters</hi>
of Cain.</p>
                     <p>3. For, ſince the Sons of Seth, and the
reſt that liv'd with Adam, may ſeem to
have follow'd a Paſtorall life, and to have
liv'd temperately; but the Daughters of
Cain to have been delicate and luxurious:
there appears on the Male's ſide ſtrength
and virility; and, on the Female's, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Moiſture, figurable by heat;
whence, 'tis conſonant, that a vaſt and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt
iſſue was born out of their conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And, out of confidence of their great
forces, men are prone to fall to injuring
and oppreſſing the weak: whence, <hi>Lamech</hi>
call'd it a <hi>conſolation,</hi> to kill all man-kind;
according to the <hi>by-word</hi> that ſaies, <hi>'Tis

2. To theſe is to be added that place, in
the <hi>Second</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> wherein 'tis ſaid, <hi>there
was of old a Heaven and an Earth, of waters
and by waters conſiſting, by the word of God,
by which that world, then, overflow<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

waters, perished:</hi> But, it cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
as if the Earth conſiſted of Water;
which is no where written, but rather the
contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Earth was created
<hi>together</hi> with the Waters: the ſenſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
is, that <hi>Heaven conſiſts of waters,</hi> the
<hi>Earth by waters,</hi> to wit, mingled together
by that mighty fire (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
largely above):<note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Conſiſting,</hi>
therefore, is refer'd to both, though it be
conſtrued with the later.</p>
                     <p>3. It ſaies, then, that the old world was
overflow'd by theſe two waters; whence,
'tis evident, thoſe are diſtinct waters which
are, here, call'd <hi>the Cataracts of heaven,</hi> from
thoſe call'd <hi>the fountains of the great abyſſe.</hi>
Now, we find no more about Heaven, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Fourth</hi> Day, but that, <hi>a vapour aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
from the Earth to water the univerſall
face of the Earth:</hi> and, that the <hi>Earth was
cover'd with a Miſt:</hi> and as much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Sea; <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaking in the perſon
of God, <hi>when I put it on a Cloud for its veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp; wrapt it in darkneſſe as in the cloaths
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:115975:217"/>
of Infancy.</hi> For, theſe ſignifie, that the
Aire was thick, and miſty; there ſweating,
by the Suns force, as it were, a perpetuall
watry humour out of the Earth, whoſe
thinner parts were of neceſſity continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rais'd up into Clouds: which could not
fall, for a time, whilſt the Aire, quite up to
them, was thick and as heavy as they: but,
after, the <hi>Earth</hi> being <hi>dry'd,</hi> the Aire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Earth and the Clouds, became
it ſelf, too, more dry and ſubtile, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall
humidity being ſpent; then, at
length, with a mighty vehemence, the
long-treaſur'd-up waters in the clouds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended;
in ſuch abundance, that the
Fountains which broke out from the
more eminent parts of the Earth were ſo
over-charg'd, they <hi>ſlit their channels</hi> and,
with open Torrents, roul'd into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and they, oreflowing their banks, all
at once into the Sea. Thus, therefore, by
the waters <hi>whereof</hi> the former <hi>Heavens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,</hi>
that is, the midſt between the Earth
and the Stars, and <hi>by which the Earth conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
viz.</hi> which lay hid in its bowels, the
whole Earth was <hi>o'reflow'd</hi> in the time of
<hi>Noe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. And the Hiſtory tells, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
roſe <hi>fifteen Cubits above the tops of the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:115975:218"/>
Mountains:</hi> now, 'tis not incredible that
ſome Men were ſo tall; ſo that this quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of water was altogether neceſſary;
nay, if there had been ſtrong Trees upon
the higheſt Mountains, which could have
reſiſted the water, this proportion of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had been leſſe then needed.</p>
                     <p>5. For, ſince, after the Deluge, <hi>Og</hi> may
ſeem to have been <hi>nine Cubits high;</hi> before
the Deluge, 'tis credible enough, there
were ſome near <hi>fifteen:</hi> Though, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
one's ſelf, there were ever Men of
that vaſtneſs which is attributed to the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clops,</hi>
and certain <hi>Reliques</hi> found in the <hi>New
World,</hi> there needs a great faith; for, theſe
ſtories depend on uncertain memories, or
on conjectures of Men talking, according
to likely-hood, of old Bones.</p>
                     <p>6. But, to return to the abundance of
the waters. The ſeverer Mathematicians,
now adaies, do not believe any Mountain
to be higher, perpendicularly, then one I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian
mile: nor need we believe the
Mountains, before the <hi>Floud,</hi> were ſo high
as they are now the vallies are hollowed
deeper with continuall Rains. If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
fifteen Cubits be abated from the
higheſt Mountains, make account the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
roſe a Mile, perpendicular, about the
Earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="411" facs="tcp:115975:218"/>
7. Whence, 'twill be deduc'd, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
an equall proportion of water out of
the Clouds and out of the bowels of the
Earth concurr'd to the Deluge: for, if a
<hi>Pail</hi> ſet in the open Aire in a very violent
rain, will be fill'd a cubits height in an
hour; in fourty daies and fourty nights,
a continuall and vehement rain from all
parts of the Heavens, would o'reflow the
whole Earth little leſſe then a thouſand
Cubits high: as much, therefore, or more
water was to be ſtrein'd out of the Earth,
that the <hi>Floud</hi> might riſe to a thouſand
Paces high.</p>
                     <p>8. Which to render credible, reflect
upon the artifice of <hi>Husbandmen,</hi> not unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
amongſt us, by which they draw ſome
feets depth of water over their barrener
grounds; with the weight whereof the
<hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the Earth being loaded, is
preſs'd down &amp; conſtipated with the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Earth, &amp; ſo fills thoſe hollowneſſes into
which the Air's entrance caus'd the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
whereupon they are rendred fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
From which experiment, 'tis evident,
that a huge weight of water brought upon
the Earth muſt compreſſe it, ſtrein out
the water which was hid in it, and repreſſe
its ſwelling; and conſequently, conſtipate
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:115975:219"/>
the Earth and force it into a leſſer Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
Since, therefore, the power of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge</hi>
may eaſily be believ'd to have exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it ſelf <hi>three miles</hi> perpendicular within
the Earth, (for the Sea is judg'd ſo deep,
now, in the deepeſt parts): let the Earth
but have contracted it ſelf one ſixth part
of thoſe three miles, and you have water
preſs'd out of its own bowels to cover it
five hundred paces round about. We have,
therefore, a fit proportion of water for ſo
great an effect, if we can contrive whence
ſo much water may have aſcended into the
Clouds.</p>
                     <p>9. But, if the little leſſe then two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years ſpace be reflected on, in which
the Sun rais'd up perpetuall vapours to
the very Sphear of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and perhaps
higher; and kept them there, by reaſon
of the continuall thickneſſe of that Aire
between the Earth and <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> It will be
eaſily credible, that there were Clouds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs'd
together enough to pour down
<hi>fourty daies and nights</hi> violent Rain; which,
we have ſaid, is ſufficient for the effect.</p>

                     <p>2. The cauſes of ſo unequall decreaſe
are two, deduc'd from the <hi>letter:</hi> a Wind
which God rais'd; and a motion of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
proceeding from the Wind. As for the
Wind, 'tis clear, when the Sun began, now,
to ſhine bright, the Clouds being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd,
and there was nothing but water
upon which it might act; there could no
other wind be rais'd, then ſuch as, even
now, we experience in that vaſt Clime of
the <hi>Pacifick</hi> and <hi>Atlantick</hi> Seas: though we
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:115975:220"/>
muſt needs think 'twas far more both ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
and ample, when there were no
Shores at all whence Contrary winds
might blow, and contract its bounds.</p>
                     <p>3. The firſt part, therefore, of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement
was made by this Wind, through
the mediation of the Sun, which turn'd the
Waters into Wind: and the Wind, now
dry'd, dry'd the waters by adheſion, as we
ſee it does <hi>Linnen cloaths,</hi> by carrying away
with it the watry parts.</p>
                     <p>4. And the <hi>Ark</hi> is believed to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
upon the higheſt Mountain in thoſe
parts. The Hebrews ſay, that it ſunk
twelve Cubits into the water; ſtill, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by this account, the water was twelve
Cubits above the neighbouring Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains:
but, <hi>theſe</hi> Cubits by reaſon of the
former contraction of the Sphear of the
waters, were leſſe, in proportion, then <hi>thoſe</hi>
whereof there were fifteen before above
the higheſt Mountains; as alſo, then <hi>thoſe</hi>
which the water had abated, from the top
of the higheſt Mountain to the top of that
upon which the Ark reſted: wherefore, to
theſe Cubits, about ſeventy daies are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd.</p>
                     <p>5. From the diſcovery of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-tops,
to the appearing of the Earths
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:115975:220"/>
                        <hi>ſuperficies,</hi> about fifty five daies more are
counted: both becauſe every day the
Sphear became more contracted, and the
Sun more ardent through the reflection
from the higher parts of the Earth; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
becauſe the motion of the water, now,
concurr'd; whereof the divine Book ſays
nothing but <hi>and the waters return'd from
the Earth, going and coming,</hi> and again, <hi>but
the waters went, and decreaſed.</hi> There can
be no doubt, but this motion of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſince it proceeded from the Wind,
which roſe from the Sun, follow'd, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
Its courſe, that is, was from Eaſt to
Weſt; and conſequently, that the water is
ſaid to have <hi>gone and come,</hi> becauſe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which was mov'd under the <hi>Aequator,</hi>
farther off from the Aequator return'd,
by the force of gravity; becauſe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was lower in thoſe parts out of which
it had been expuls'd by the Wind: And
this, 'till the mountain tops appear'd, was
regular; but, afterwards, by incountring
the mountains and higher parts of the
Earth, this courſe of the water, at leaſt in
thoſe parts, was interrupted.</p>
                     <p>6. Whence, ther's no farther mention
of it; though its effect towards drying up
the water began then to be greateſt: For,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:115975:221"/>
by this flux of the water, the Earth, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
was heap'd up towards the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and there was a more ample Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
dig'd for the waters, eſpecially in that
part which was to remain cover'd with
them. Whence, the <hi>fourth book</hi> of <hi>Eſdras</hi>
witneſſes, that, at the <hi>Creation</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi>
there remain'd only a <hi>ſeventh</hi> part cover'd
with <hi>waters;</hi> but, now, Coſmographers
will have the <hi>Superficies</hi> to be half Sea.</p>
                     <p>7. Moreover, by this agitation, if any
Cave remain'd empty within the Earth,
there was a paſſage opened to it for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Whence it appears, what became of
ſuch a mighty bulk of water: for no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
part of it was conſum'd by the Sun in
Wind, and to condenſe the upper Aire to
that proportion which was convenient for
the nature of things; another part was
ſwallow'd up into the cavities of the Earth;
the reſt, having dig'd it ſelf a vaſt Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,
remain'd in that part of the Earth,
which we, now, call <hi>Sea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. But, I muſt not paſſe over this place,
without adviſing that the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>flux</hi>
and <hi>reflux</hi> of the <hi>Sea</hi> is clearly taught to
proceed from the <hi>Wind,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">B. 3. Leſ. 13.</note> as 'tis
explicated in <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſtraight adding, <hi>and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:115975:221"/>
return'd from the Earth, going and coming,</hi>
immediately after the <hi>bringing the Spirit
upon the Earth.</hi> But, ſome may object, that,
during the fourty daies rain, there was no
ſuch wind; and conſequently, no Flux of
the Sea neither; and, becauſe the Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
motion follows from that, neither can
there have been Daies and Nights.</p>
                     <p>9. 'Tis anſwer'd, Such vaſt Clouds and
Rain could not happen without Tempeſts;
and conſequently, ſince this Rain was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
a regular Wind, too, accompany'd
it; and this, according to the courſe of
the Sun, ſince the greateſt heat is not to
be expected but under the Sun: The
Wind, therefore, was more vehement thoſe
fourty daies, to roul about ſuch a Maſſe
of waters; whence the equality of daies
and nights may have been preſerv'd either
wholly or very near. 'Tis a ſign, too, of
a Wind, that the <hi>Ark</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>carry'd
upon the waters,</hi> and to have reſted upon a
Mountain, whereas 'twas made in a Vally.</p>
                     <p>10. The ſacred Hiſtorian ſeems to add
<hi>two</hi> other cauſes of the decreaſe of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>shutting up</hi> of the <hi>Fountains</hi> of
the <hi>Abyſſe,</hi> and of the <hi>Cataracts</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi>
or the prohibition of Rain from Heaven:
But, this later cauſe is clearly an effect of
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:115975:222"/>
the wind's being calm'd and of the Clouds
being all ſpent, as already fallen down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth: And the former is an effect
of the drying of the Mountains; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Mountains were dry'd, vapours
began to aſcend into their tops, which
flow'd out in little channells and rivulets,
as before the <hi>Deluge:</hi> whence, it appears
that their <hi>reading,</hi> too, who interpret it <hi>the
fountains of the Abyſſe were reveal'd,</hi> comes to
the ſame thing.</p>

that, unleſſe the Sun ſhine otherwhere,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:115975:222"/>
there appears no Rainbow; 'tis clear,
therefore, that there is not enough Rain
in the Clouds, to o'rewhelm the Earth.</p>
                     <p>2. But, ſince, theſe words were ſaid to
<hi>Noe,</hi> who had already liv'd <hi>ſix hundred</hi> years;
if he had beheld the <hi>Rainbow</hi> ſo many
years, and afterwards experienc'd the

muſt ſay, therefore, that, without doubt,
the Rainbow was never us'd to be ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Floud;</hi> nor is it hard to render a
reaſon on't, out of what has been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>3. For, ſince Naturaliſts tell us, a <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi>
is made out of a double or triple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
or refraction of light in every
drop of a light ſhow'ry cloud; whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
this variety of colours: and light,
ſo weak and ſcattered, or, the foreſaid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
cannot reach our Eyes at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
unleſſe the <hi>Aire</hi> be very <hi>clear</hi> and
pure: and, through the humidity of the
Earth joyn'd with heat, a thick Aire inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped
the Earth all that time: 'Twas abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
impoſſible a Rainbow ſhould be
ſeen.</p>
                     <p>4. Beſides, it ſeems, that, for all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
years, a great maſſe of Clouds muſt
needs have ſo cover'd the face of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:115975:223"/>
that the Sun was rather felt then ſeen;
as we find 'tis, for whole weeks, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
together, in Winter in thoſe Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Countries which, yet, are not exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
cold. No wonder, therefore, the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow
had not ſhew'd it ſelf before the <hi>Floud.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. Next, 'tis to be obſerv'd how God
contracted the <hi>Age</hi> of men, and with what
he requited it. Now, 'tis evident, that the
Earth, by means of the <hi>Deluge,</hi> became far
colder and dryer: That 'twas colder, after
ſuch a Maſſe of waters, ſo long, not only
covering and compreſſing it, but penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into its very bowells, any one will
believe.</p>
                     <p>6. But, that water ſhould dry, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
hardlyer relliſh: but, if we conſider,
that <hi>ſodden</hi> things are rendred dry, through
the extraction of their naturall moiſture,
when they are too much boil'd: if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
that <hi>Trees</hi> are thrown by <hi>Timber-men</hi>
into water, leaſt their native moiſture
ſhould exuberate into rottenneſſe and
worms; and after a convenient time they
are taken out again dryer then at firſt: if
we obſerve that <hi>Diſtillers,</hi> to extract the
moiſture of Herbs, beſprinkle the plants
they are about with water or ſome other
proportionate liquour: if laſtly, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:115975:223"/>
that <hi>Gold-ſmiths,</hi> to ſeparate the
Silver, mixt, in a little quantity, with other
metalls, mix more Silver withall: 'Twill
be evident, that, when the Earth redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with well-digeſted moiſture, there was
no better way of drying it, then, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
another moiſture, to render that was
in it more ſeparable, and preſſe out both
together; as Nature it ſelf operates in rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe.</p>
                     <p>7. Suppoſing, therefore, the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
both colder and dryer, the Plants
and Animals muſt of neceſſity have drawn
a more malignant juyce &amp; food out of it.
For, ſince <hi>Vegetation</hi> conſiſts in heat &amp; moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture;
<hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Old Age</hi> muſt be in their
oppoſites, and out of them, be deriv'd to
living Creatures: wherefore, ſince, after
the <hi>Deluge,</hi> men ſometimes liv'd 150 &amp; 200
years, the long life of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before
the <hi>Floud,</hi> mention'd in the Scriptures, is
not incredible. Hence 'tis that Animals
were now aſſign'd to man for <hi>food:</hi> and, 'tis
not ſaid, that <hi>he shall rule over them,</hi> as at
the beginning; but the <hi>terrour of him shall
be upon</hi> the other Animals: For, at firſt,
they ſerv'd him as <hi>Inſtruments;</hi> but now
they were to become fierce and wild,
whence man would contrive to kill them,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:115975:224"/>
and they, conſequently, like perverſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
fly and be affraid of him, as their
chaſtizer.</p>
                     <p>8. And, theſe indeed God gave to man;
but another thing far greater. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Earth was become dryer, the
Aire too round about man was made pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
and thinner; and, both by his Food
and by the Aire, his Body was rendred, as,
not ſo vaſt and durable, ſo, more ſubtile-ſpirited
and more apt to be ſubjected to
his Soul, and fitter for the operations <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
to it.</p>
                     <p>9. Men, therefore, grew ſharper wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and more addicted to <hi>Sciences</hi> and <hi>Arts;</hi>
and, by conſequence, computing <hi>all</hi>
things, the <hi>World</hi> became <hi>better</hi> and <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter:</hi>
ſince, there would, neceſſarily, be
many more men, by reaſon of the little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of their Bodies, and ſuch frequent
changes, through the ſhortneſſe of their
lives; and yet, nay much the rather, more
forward and riper for the eternall life of

how the benediction, given
to <hi>Noe</hi> and his Sons, <hi>to encreaſe and fill the

and were very unwilling to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
which is collected out of thoſe
words, that, in the originall text, ſay <hi>the
Earth was one lip and the ſame words:</hi> for,
that a <hi>lip</hi> ſignifies the <hi>words</hi> of men, is
found, by the ſenſe, every where; as, when
they are call'd <hi>Deceitfull lips, Our lips are

but, where 'tis taken for a <hi>Language,</hi>
I know not.</p>
                     <p>2. But, becauſe the ſenſe of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
terms muſt be different, <hi>and the ſame
words;</hi> this Phraſe will ſignifie that they
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:115975:225"/>
deſired and ſought how to remain united,
as 'tis ſaid more manifeſtly below. Whence,
'tis no light ſuſpicion, that this mind in
them proceeded from the inſtigation of
ſome One that affected a <hi>Tyranny</hi> over
Mankind; which ſome Hiſtorians, alſo,
witneſſe.</p>
                     <p>4. Proceeding, therefore, in this
thought, they ſat down in the fields about
<hi>Babylon;</hi> and there, either mutually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
by one another, or elſe by ſome one,
as I ſaid, they deliberated from the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
&amp; commodiouſneſſe of <hi>Bricks</hi> and
<hi>Pitch,</hi> to build themſelves a <hi>City</hi> and a <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi>
for two reaſons, To get themſelves a

over the</hi> Earth; for, ſo the Hebrew reading
has it, <hi>leaſt perhaps,</hi> or rather, <hi>leaſt at any

                     </p>
                     <p>5. They imagin'd, therefore, that, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of the <hi>Tower,</hi> which would have
no fellow, all men would willingly ſtay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thoſe places. Of the <hi>Tower</hi> 'tis ſaid
in the Hebrew, <hi>whoſe head in Heaven,</hi> that
is, where the Birds fly, or even the Clouds;
intimating, that they deſign'd to continue
on this edifice even to the Clouds, which
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:115975:225"/>
Naturaliſts ſay, ſometimes, are not rais'd
more then 340 paces above the Earth:
which height is not ſo vaſt and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
that it might not fall into the
thoughts of men, and even be perfected,
too; according to what God ſaid, that
<hi>They would not deſiſt, till they should have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht
them in deed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. But God turn'd their own very
counſells upon their own heads: for the
fond pains, and perhaps, (which ſome Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
inſinuate) becauſe the Tower, when
it had been brought to a very great
height, was thrown down by the winds
and lightnings, (as it uſes to happen to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
high Fabricks) made them weary
of the work and its Authour, ſo that they
would no longer obey him, nor even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
together: but ſeverall Companies,
as they could agree among themſelves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted

                     </p>
                     <p>6. And, <hi>this</hi> explication is clear, nor in
any ſort violent to the <hi>letter;</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the nature of things: whereas, <hi>that</hi>
which the moſt follow contains ſo vaſt a
Miracle (and whereof we have no other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
unleſſe, perhaps, in <hi>the effuſion of the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:115975:226"/>
Holy Ghoſt);</hi> that it may ſeem violent to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
it out of words, in their ordinary
ſenſe, ſignifying another thing. For, <hi>to be
of one lip,</hi> &amp; <hi>lips to be confounded</hi> or Tongues,
agrees with common ſenſe to ſignifie, the
one, <hi>conſent,</hi> the other, <hi>diſſention:</hi> but to
transferre theſe to multitude of <hi>languages</hi>
is leſſe naturall: which yet, if otherwiſe
there were a ſufficient <hi>Authority,</hi> to ſhew
the effect done, is no waies to be rejected;
but, if the whole ſtory draws its originall
from this only Text, it will have no bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
nor ſolidity.</p>
                     <p>7. But hence, perhaps, ſome may
ground their belief, that 'Tis not eaſie to
imagine whence <hi>Languages</hi> ſhould have
been <hi>divided</hi> amongſt mankind, and have
grown into ſo many kinds. To which we
reply, that, whoever ſhall but obſerve what
is uſuall in his own City or Countrey,
will eaſily diſcern how ſo great a variety
of Dialects has grown into the world. For,
'tis evident, the perfection of a Language
conſiſts among the Better-bred; and the
<hi>rude People</hi> corrupt the leſſe uſuall words,
thoſe that ſpeak <hi>faſt</hi> cut them ſhort, the
<hi>Countrey folks</hi> likewiſe make a ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
of their own. Adde to theſe,
that divers Cities and Provinces have
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:115975:226"/>
form'd Dialects of their own; which yet,
ther's no doubt, are contain'd all under
one Idiome.</p>
                     <p>8. Conſider, then, the minglings of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
languages; a Country ſometimes
being ſubdu'd by a Nation of a different
Idiome; ſometimes, by the frequent Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
of ſingle perſons, the words of one
Idiome being deriv'd to another.</p>
                     <p>9. Laſtly, let's reflect on the originall
<hi>root</hi> of <hi>diverſity:</hi> Which conſiſts in this,
That, words are compos'd of <hi>Vowels</hi> and
<hi>Conſonants;</hi> and the differences of <hi>Vowels</hi>
riſe from a wider or a more form'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
opening both of the Mouth and
Throat; but, that of <hi>Conſonants</hi> proceeds
from an interception of the Breath go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out through the divers organs of the
Teeth, Lips, Tongue; from its alliſion to
them and the Palate of the mouth; with
ſome help of the Noſtrills and the ſhutting
up of the Throat.</p>
                     <p>10. Now, 'tis evident, theſe members
and inſtruments of <hi>Voice</hi> are compos'd of
the <hi>Elements;</hi> and conſequently, from
their temperament, are more diſpos'd to
one motion then to another; and, which
follows, that, from the <hi>Site</hi> of the Regions
where men live, they are more inclin'd to
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:115975:227"/>
ſome <hi>Vowels</hi> or <hi>Conſonants</hi> then to others:
whence it comes to paſſe, that, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
farther pains, <hi>Vowels</hi> and <hi>Conſonants</hi> are
chang'd by little and little, and ther's ſuch
a diverſity made, that they can no longer
underſtand one another.</p>
                     <p>11. And, that the difference of <hi>Idioms</hi>
grew after this manner, from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;
it may be hence conjectur'd,
becauſe the <hi>Chaldaick, Syriack, Arabick</hi>
Tongues diſcover a manifeſt derivation
from and affinity with the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> And,
that the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> too, of old ſprung
from it, ſeems hence conjecturable, that In
all the <hi>Peregrinations</hi> of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> or
even the commerces of the <hi>Kings</hi> with <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
ther's no where any mention that
They did not underſtand one another:
moreover, the Aegyptian names comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morated
in Scripture, as <hi>Moyſes, Pharao,
Nechao, Putiphar &amp;c.</hi> are Hebrew names,
too. Farther, 'tis plain, that the very name
<hi>Babel</hi> is Hebrew; which, yet, remain'd to
the City from which the Family of <hi>Heber</hi>
is believ'd to have departed, and to have
gone and reſided far enough off; if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was of that Family.</p>
                     <p>12. To conclude, it ſeems naturall to
the Originall Tongue to be very ſhort,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:115975:227"/>
                        <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Monoſyllables</hi> only, as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the <hi>primitive</hi> words: and the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
words, of neceſſity, are of a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
number, ſince, we ſcarce find more
then ſeven firſt-Conſonants; for the reſt
are varied either in a greater or leſſe <hi>aſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or by the <hi>compoſition</hi> of more toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
whence, 'twould be no hard thing
to find the number of all the <hi>primitive</hi>
words: wherefore, 'tis clear, there cannot
be many originall Idioms, whoſe primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
words ſhould be <hi>Monoſyllables.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13. Some will object, the Hebrew is an
Originall, and yet not all its <hi>primitive</hi>
words are Monoſyllables: v. gr. <hi>Adam, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,
Shamaim,</hi> (which name God impos'd
upon Heaven) <hi>Abel, &amp;c.</hi> and finally, <hi>Babel</hi>
it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>14. 'Tis anſwer'd, <hi>Adam, Abel,</hi> and <hi>Eva</hi>
are monoſyllables; for, in <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
the Article is joyn'd to the name: For,
ſince God impos'd the name upon <hi>Adam,</hi>
'tis impoſſible he ſhould have call'd him
<hi>Adam</hi> from the name of the <hi>Earth:</hi> for,
ſince <hi>Adama</hi> ſignifies primarily a ſpeciall
nature of Earth, which is <hi>red,</hi> and the name
is transferr'd thence to the whole Earth;
moreover, that ſort of Earth took the
name of its <hi>Colour,</hi> and the colours name
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:115975:228"/>
is from the primitive <hi>dam</hi> which ſignifies
<hi>bloud;</hi> 'tis not credible that God gave ſuch
a derivative name to Man. <hi>Adam,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
is, as it were, <hi>ha-dam,</hi> that is, <hi>the like,
viz.</hi> to God. In like manner the name of
<hi>Abel</hi> is <hi>Bel,</hi> that is, <hi>confuſion;</hi> as alſo <hi>Babel</hi>
ſignifies not <hi>confuſion,</hi> but <hi>in confuſion.</hi> The
name of <hi>Heaven</hi> is a derivative from the
primitive <hi>mai,</hi> which is a monoſyllable.
But, the <hi>Diſſyllables</hi> which conſtitute the
Subſtance of that Language as 'tis <hi>amongſt
us,</hi> are compounded, though they ſeem to
us primitives.</p>
                     <p>15 Thus, therefore, the ſecond time,
was the world, by <hi>diviſion,</hi> repleniſht with
<hi>men:</hi> God turning our <hi>Evils</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Good</hi> to us; and His Providence ſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
our <hi>ills,</hi> and changing our <hi>goods</hi>
into <hi>better,</hi> according to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<hi>We know that, to thoſe that love God, all
things cooperate for good, to thoſe who, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his purpoſe, are called Saints.</hi>
