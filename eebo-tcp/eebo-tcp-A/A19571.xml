            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And to perfourme the same, he made a sacrifice &amp; oblation of his owne body vpon the crosse, whiche was a full redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, satisfaction, &amp; propitiation for the sinnes of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wholle world.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9792:9"/>
Christes legacie and testament, that he is mad partaker of the bloude of Christe, whyche was shed for vs.
And this ment saynte Paule, when he saith:<q>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> Is not the cuppe of blessyng which we blesse, a communion of the bloude of Christe? Is not the breade, whiche we breake, a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the body of Christe?</q>
So that no man can contemne or lyghtly esteme this holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, excepte he contemne also Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud, and passe not whether he haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny felowshyp wyth hym or no.

               <p>And whan she seeth nothyng but damnation for her offences,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> by iustice and accusation of the lawe, and this damnation is euer before her eies, than in this great distresse the soule beyng pressed with heuynesse &amp; sorowe, seketh for some comfort, and desireth some remedy for her mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and sorowful estate. And this feelynge of her damnable condicion, and gredy desyre of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshyng, is the spirituall hunger of the soule.</p>
               <p>And who soeuer hath this godly hunger, is blessed of God, and shal haue meate and drynke ynough, as Christ hym self said:<q> Blessed be they that hunger and thirst for rightousnes, for they shalbe fylled ful.<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note>

<q>
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 1.</note> For as almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God feedeth them that be hungry, so doth he sende awaie empty all that be not hungry.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But this hunger and thyrst is not easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued of the carnall man. For when he hereth the holy ghoste speake of meate and drynk, his mynde is by and by in the kytchen and buttery, and he thynketh vpon his dyshes and pottes, his mouthe and his bealy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9792:12"/>But the scripture in sundry places vseth spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall wordes, wherby to drawe our grosse myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des from the phantasyeng of our teeth and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and from this carnall and fleshely imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For the Apostles and disciples of Christe, when they were yet carnall, knew not what was ment by this kynde of hunger and meate, and therfore when they desired hym to eate,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe their myndes from carnall meate, he said vnto theim:<q> I haue other meate to eate, whiche you knowe not.</q>
And why knewe they it not? Forsothe because their myndes were grosse as yet, and had not receyued the fulnesse of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. And therfore our sauiour Christ, myndyng to drawe them from this grossenes, tolde theim of an other kynd of meate, then they phantasied (as it were) rebukyng them, for that they percei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued not, that there was any other kynde of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinkyng, besides that eatyng and drin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kyng, whiche is with the mouth and the throte.</p>
               <p>Likewyse whan he sayd to the woman of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria:<q> Who so euer shall drynke of that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Iho. 4.</note> that I shall geue hym, shall neuer be thirsty agayn.</q>
They that heard hym speake those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, might well perceyue, that he went about to make them wel acquaynted with an other kynd of drinkynge, than is the drynkynge with the mouth and throte. For there is no suche kynd of drynke, that with ones drynkyng, can quenche the thirst of a mans body for euer. Wherfore, in saiyng: He shall neuer be thirsty agayn. he dyd
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9792:12"/>
drawe theyr myndes from drynkynge with the mouth, vnto an other kind of drinkyng wherof they knew not, and vnto an other kynd of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, wherwith as yet thei wer not acquainted.</p>
               <p>Also when our sauiour Christe saide:<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note>
                  <q>He that commeth to me, shal nat hunger: and, He that be leueth on me, shall neuer bee thyrstye.</q>
he gaue them a plaine watche worde, that there was an other kynd of meat and drinke, then that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he fedde them at the other syde of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and an other kynde of hungryng and thyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stynge, then was the hungrynge and thirstyng of the body. By these wordes therfore he droue the people to vnderstand an other kynde of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng and drinkyng, of hungring and thyrstyng then that, whiche belongeth onely for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of temporal lyfe.</p>
               <p>Nowe then as the thyng that comforteth the body, is called Meate and drynke, of a lyke sor the scripture calleth the same thynge that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth the soule, Meate and drynke.</p>

               <p>The meate, drynke, foode and refreshynge of the soule, is our sauiour Christe, as he sayd him selfe:<q>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 11.</note> Come vnto me all you that trauayle and bee laden, and I will refreshe you. And, Yf any man be drye (saieth he) let hym come to me and drynke.<note place="margin">Iohn. 7.</note> He that beleueth in me, flouddes of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               </p>
               <p>For as meate and drynke do comfort the hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gry body, so doth the death of Christes body, &amp; the sheddyng of his bloud comforte the soule, when she is after her sort hungry. What thyng is it that comforteth &amp; norisheth the body? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth meate and drynke. By what meanes than shall we call the body and bloud of our sauiour Christe (whiche doo comforte and nouryshe the hungrye soule) but by the names of meate and drynke?
And this similitude caused our sauiour to say:<q>
                     <note place="margin">Iho. 6.</note> My fleshe is very meate, and my bloud is very drynke.</q>
For there is no kynde of meate that is comfortable to the soule, but onely the death of Christes blessed body: nor no kynde of drynke, that can quenche her thyrst, but only the bloudsheddyng of our sauiour Christe, whiche was shed for her offences.</p>
               <p>For as there is a carnall generation, and a carnal feedyng &amp; nourishement, so is there also a spiritual generation, and a spiritual feadyng.</p>
               <p>And as euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by carnal generation of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, is carnally begotten and born vnto this mortall lyfe, so is euery good christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spiritually borne by Christ vnto eternall life.</p>

               <p>And although our carnall generation &amp; oure carnall nourishement, be knowen to all men by dayly experience, and by oure common senses, yet this our spirituall generation and our spiri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuall nutrition, be so obscure and hyd vnto vs, that we can not attayn to the true and perfecte knowledge and feelyng of theym, but onely by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9792:14"/>
faith, whyche muste bee grounded vpon Gods moste holy worde and sacramentes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AND</hi> for this consideration our Sauioure Christe hath not onely sette forth these thynges moste playnly in his holy woorde, that we maie heare them with our eares, but he hath also or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned one visible sacrament of spiritual rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in water, and an other visible sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of spiritual norishment in bread and wine to the intente, that as muche as is possible for man, we may se Christ with our eies, smell him at our nose, taste hym with our mouthes, grope hym with our handes, and perceue him with all our senses. For as the word of god preched, put<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth Christ into our eares, so likewyse these ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of water, bread and wine, ioyned to gods word, do after a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal maner, put Christ in to our eies, mouthes, handes and al our senses.</p>
               <p>And for this cause Christ ordeyned baptisme in water, that as surely as we se, fele and touch water with our bodies, and be washed with wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, so assuredly ought we to beleue, whan we be baptised, that Christ is veryly present with vs, and that by hym we bee newly borne agayn spiritually, and washed from our synnes, and grafted in the stocke of Christes own body, and be apparailed, clothed, and harnessed with hym, in suche wyse, that as the dyuel hath no power agaynst Christe, so hath he none against vs, so long as we remayne grafted in that stocke, and be clothed with that apparel and harnesed with
<pb facs="tcp:9792:15"/>
that armour. So that the washyng in water of baptisme, is as it wer shewyng of Christ before our eyes, and a sensible touchyng, feelyng and gropyng of hym, to the confirmation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde faithe, whiche we haue in hym.</p>
               <p>And in lyke maner Christ ordeined the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his body and bloud in bread and wine, to preach vnto vs, that as our bodies be fedde, nourished, and preserued with meate and drink, so (as touchynge our spirituall lyfe towardes God) we be fed, nourished and preserued by the body and bloud of our sauiour Christ, and also that he is such a preseruation vnto vs, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the deuils of hell, nor eternall deth, nor syn, can be able to preuaile against vs, so long as by true and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant faith, we be fed and nouryshed with that meate and drynke. And for this cause Christ ordeyned this sacrament in bread &amp; wine (whiche we eate and drynke, and be chiefe nutri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes of our body) to the intent, that as sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we see the breade and wine with our eies, smell theim with our noses, touche theym with our handes, and tast them with our mouths, so assuredly ought we to beleue, that Christ is our spirituall lyfe and sustinance of our soules, like as the sayd bread and wyne is the foode and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinaunce of our bodies. And no lesse ought we to doubt, that our soules bee fedde and lyue by Christe, then that our bodies be fed and lyue by meate and drinke. Thus oure sauiour Christe, knowing vs to be in this world (as it were) but

               <p>And in this sorowful heauines, holy scripture teacheth theim, that our heauenly father can by no meanes be pleased with theim againe, but by the sacrifice and deathe of his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sonne, whereby God hathe made a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall amitee and peace with vs, doth pardon the sinnes of them that beleue in him, maketh theim his chyldren, &amp; giueth them to his first begotten son Christe, to be incorporate into him, to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by him, and to be made heires of heuen with him. And in the receauing of the holy supper of our Lorde, wee bee putte in remembraunce of

               <p>Wherefore in this sacrament (yf it be rightly receaued with a true faithe) we bee assured that our sinnes bee forgiuen, and the leage of peace and the testament of God is confirmed betwene hym and vs, so that who so euer by a true faithe doth eate Christes flesh, and drinke his bludde, hath euerlastinge lyfe by hym.

And althoughe there be the colour of bread &amp; wyne, the sauour, the smell, the bygnes, the fashion, and all other (as they call them) accidentes, or qualities and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9792:19"/>
qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tities of bread and wyne, yet (say they) there is no very bread nor wyne, but they bee turned into the fleshe &amp; bloud of Christ. And this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion they call Transubstantion, that is to say, turnyng of one substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into another substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And although all the accidentes, bothe of the bread and wyne, remayne styl, yet (say they) the same accidentes, be in no maner of thyng, but hang alone in the ayre, without any thyng to stay them vpon. For in the body and bloud of Christ (say they) these accidentes can not be, nor yet in the ayre, for the body and bloud of Christ and the ayre, be neither of that bignes, fashion, smell, nor colour, that they bread and wyne be.

And so there remaineth whitnes, but nothing is white: there remayneth colours, but nothing is colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therwith: there remaineth roundnes, but no thyng is round: and there is bygnes, and yet no thyng is bygge: there is swetenes, without any swete thyng: softnes, without any soft thyng: breakyng, without any thyng broken: diuision, without any thyng deuided: and so other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; quantities, witout any thyng to receyue them.

furth by schole authors, whose studye was euer to defende and set abrode to the worlde all suche matters, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> byshop of Rome had once decreed. And the deuil by his minister Antichrist, had so daseled the eyes of a great multitude of christen people in these latter dayes, that they sought not for their fayth, at the cleare light of Gods worde, but at the Romishe Antichrist, beleuyng whatsoeuer he prescribed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea though it were against all reason, all senses, and Gods most holy worde also. For els he could not haue been very Antichrist in dede, except he had been so repugnaunt vnto Christe, whose doctrine is cleane contrary to this doctrine of Antichrist. For Christ teacheth, that we receiue very bread and wyne in the most blessed supper of the Lord as sacramentes to admonishe vs, that as we be fedde with bread &amp; wyne bodely, so wee be fedde with the body and bloud of our sauiour Christ spiritually. As in our baptisme we receiue very water, to signifye vnto vs, that as water is an element to washe the body outwardly, so be our soules washed by the holy ghost inwardly.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is of the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Christ in this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>The seconde principall thyng, wherein the Papistes varry from the truth of Gods worde, is this. They say, that the very natural fleshe and bloud of Christe, whiche suffered for vs vpon the crosse, and sitteth at the right hand of the father in heauen, is also really, substancial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, corporally, and naturally, in or vnder the accidentes of the sacramental bread and wyne,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:9792:20"/>
which they cal, the fourmes of bread and wyne. And yet here they varry not a lytle among them selues. For some say, that the very natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ is there, but not naturally, nor sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly. And other saye, that it is there naturally and sensibly, and of the same bygnes &amp; fashion that it is in heauen, and as the same was borne of the blessed virgyn Mary, and that it is there broken and torne in peeces with our teethe. And this appeareth partly by the schole authors, and partly by the confession of Beringarius,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De consecra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ti. Distin.</hi> 2. <hi>Ego Berin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius.</hi>
                  </note> whiche Nicholaus the second constrayned him to make, whiche was this. That of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the Lordes table the sayd Beringa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius should promise to holde that fayth, whiche the sayd Pope Nicholas and his counsail held, whiche was, that not onely the sacramentes of bread and wyne, but also the very fleshe and bloud of oure Lorde Iesu Christ, are sensibly handeled of the priest in the altare, broken and torne with the teethe of the faythfull people.
But the true catholike fayth, grounded vpon Gods moste infallible woorde, teacheth vs, that our sauiour Christ (as concernyng his mannes nature and bodely presence) is gone vp vnto heauen, &amp; sitteth at the right hand of his father, and there shall he tarry vntyl the worldes ende, at what tyme he shal come agayn, to iudge both the quicke and the dead, as he sayth him selfe in many scriptures.<q>
                     <note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> I forsake the worlde (sayth he) and go to my Father. And in another place
<pb facs="tcp:9792:21"/>
he sayth:<note place="margin">Mat. 26</note> You shal haue euer poore men among you, but me you shall not euer haue. And again he sayth:<note place="margin">Mat. 24</note> Many hereafter shall come and laye: Loke here is Christe, or looke there he is, but beloue them not. And sainct Peter sayth in the Actes,<note place="margin">Act. 3.</note> that heauen must receiue Christe, vntyll the tyme that all thynges shall be restored.</q>And saint Paule writyng to the Colossians,<note place="margin">Colos. 3</note> agreeth hereto, saiyng:
<q> Seke for thinges that be aboue, where Christ is sittyng at the right hand of the father.</q>
And sainct Paule speakyng of the very sacrament,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11</note> sayth:<q> As often as you shall eate this bread, and drynke this cuppe, shewe furth the Lordes death vntyll he come.</q>
Tyll he come sayth S. Paule, signifiyng, that he is not there corporally present. For what speeche were this or who vseth of him that is already present, to say, Untyl he come? For Untyl I come, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he is not yet present. This is the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fayth, whiche we learne from our youth in our common Crede, and whiche Christ taught, the Apostles folowed, and the martyres confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with theyr bloud.</p>
               <p>And although Christ in his humayne nature substantially, really, corporally, naturally and sensibly, be present with his father in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet sacramentally and spiritually he is here present in water bread and wyne, as in signes and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, but he is in deede spiritually in the faythfull christian people, whiche accordyng to Christes ordinaunce be baptised, or receyue the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9792:21"/>
holye communion, or vnfainedly beleue in him. Thus haue you hard the seconde pryncipal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, wherin the Papistes vary from the truthe of Goddes worde, and from the catholike faith.</p>
               <p>Nowe the thyrde thynge, wherin they varye, is this.</p>
               <p>The Papistes saye,<note place="margin">The thyrd is that euil men eate &amp; drinke the very bodye and bloode of Christ.</note> that euell and vngodlye men receaue in this sacramente the very bodye and bloud of Christe, and eate and drynke the selfe same thinge, that the good and godly men doo. But the truthe of Gods woorde is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that al those that be godly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres of Christe, as they corporally eate the bread and drinke the wyne, so spiritually they eate and drinke Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes very fleshe and bloude. And as for the wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked membres of the dyuell, they eate the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental bread, and drinke the sacramental wyne, but they doo not spiritually eate Christs fleshe nor drinke his blode, but they eate and drinke theyr owne damnation.</p>
               <p>The fourthe thynge, wherein the Popyshe preestes dissente frome the manifest woorde of God, is this. They saie, that they offre Christe euery day for remission of sinne, and distribute by their Masses, the merites of Christes passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the prophetes, apostels and euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes doo saye, that Christe him selfe in his owne person made a sacrifice for our sinnes vppon the Crosse, by whose woundes all our diseases were healed, and our sinnes pardoned, and so dyd neuer no preest, man, nor creature but he, nor he

And whan he sayd (<hi>bo-</hi>) yet the breade was ther styll. But when hee hadde fynyshed the whole sentence, <hi>Thys is my body.</hi> than (saye they) the breade was gone, and there remained no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce but Christes bodye, as thoughe the breade coulde not remaine, whan it is made a sacramente.

Wherfore they must nedes be vnderstand of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very bread, that Christ toke bread, brake bread, gaue bread to his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundyng them to take bread, and eate bread. But the same is more plaine and euident of the wyne, that it remayneth, and is dronken at the Lordes supper, aswell by the wordes that go before, as by the woordes that folowe after the consecracion.
For before the wordes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secracion, Christe tooke the cuppe of wyne, and gaue it vnto his disciples,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. Mat. 14,</note> and sayd:<q> Drynk you all <hi>of this.</hi> And after the wordes of consecracion foloweth, They dranke all <hi>of yt.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe I aske all the Papistes, what thyng it was that Christ commaunded his disciples to drynke, whan he sayd, Drynke you all of this? The bloud of Christ was not yet there, by their owne confession, for it was spoken before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secracion: Therfore it could be nothyng els but wyne that he commaunded them to drynke.</p>
               <p>Then I aske the Papistes ones againe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the disciples dranke wyne or not? If they say, yea, then let them recant their errour, that there was no wyne remainyng after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. If they say nay, then they condempne the
<pb facs="tcp:9792:24"/>
Apostles of disobedience to Christes commaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement, whiche dranke not wyne as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded them. Or rather they reproue Christ as a Iuggler, which commaunded his Apostles to drynke wyne, and whan they came to the dryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng therof, he him selfe had conuayed it away.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, before Christ deliuered the cuppe of wyne to his disciples, he sayd vnto them: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide</hi> this among you.<note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Here would I aske the Papistes another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, what thyng it was that Christ commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his disciples to deuide among them? I am sure they wyll not saye, it was the cuppe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they bee disposed to make menne laugh at them. Nor I thynke they wyll not say, it was the bloud of Christ, aswell because the woordes were spoken before the consecration, as because the bloud of Christ is not deuided, but spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally geuen whole in the sacrament. Than could it be vnderstande of nothyng elles but of wyne, whiche they should deuide among them, and drynke all together.</p>
               <p>Also when the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion was ended, Christ sayd vnto his Apostles.
<q>Uerely I say vnto you, that I wyll drynke no more hencefurth of <hi>this fruite of the vyne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 26. Mar. 14.</note> vntyl y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day, that I shal drynke it newe with you, in my fathers kyngdome.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By these wordes it is cleare, that it was very wyne that the Apostles dra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke at that godly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For the bloud of Christ is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruite of the vyne, nor the accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of wyne, nor none other
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9792:24"/>
thing is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit of the vine, but very wyne only.</p>
               <p>Howe could Christ haue expressed more plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, that bread &amp; wyne remayne, than by takyng the breade in his handes, and breakyng it him selfe, and geuyng it vnto his disciples, comaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng them to eate it? And by takyng the cuppe of wyne in his handes, and deliueryng it vnto them, commaundyng them to deuide it among them, &amp; to drynke it, &amp; callyng it the fruit of the vyne? These wordes of Christ be so playn, that if an Angel of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would tel vs the contrary, he ought not to be beleued. And than much lesse may we beleue the subtyl liyng of the Papistes.</p>
               <p>If Christ would haue had vs to beleue (as a necessary article of our fayth) that there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth neither bread nor wyne, would he haue spoken after this sorte, vsyng all suche termes and circumstaunces as should make vs beleue, that styl there remayneth bread &amp; wyne? What maner of teacher make thei of Christ, that say, he ment one thyng, when his wordes be cleane con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary? What christian heart can paciently suffre this contumely of Christ?</p>
               <p>But what crafty teachers be these Papistes, who deuise phantasies of their owne heades, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to Christes teachyng, and than sette the same abrode to christen people, to bee moste assuredly beleued as Goddes owne moste holy worde? Sainct Paule did not so, but folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed herein the maner of Christes speakyng, in callyng of bread, bread, and wyne, wyne, and
<pb facs="tcp:9792:25"/>
neuer alteryng Christes woordes herein.
<q>The <hi>bread</hi> whiche wee breake (sayth he) is it not the communion of Christes body?<note place="margin">1. Co. 10</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe I aske agayn of the Papists, whether he spake this of the bread consecrated or not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated? Thei can not say that he spake it of the bread vnconsecrated, for that is not the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Christes body by their owne doctrine. And if S. Paule spake it of bread consecrated, than they must needes confesse, that after conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracion suche bread remayneth, as is broken bread, whiche can bee none other than very true material bread.
And straight wayes after sainct Paule sayth in the same place,<q>
                     <note place="margin">1. Co. 10</note> that wee be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of one bread and one cuppe.</q>
And in the next chapiter, speakyng more fully of the same matter, four tymes he nameth the bread and the cuppe, neuer makyng mention of any transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, or remainyng of accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes without any substaunce, whiche thynges he would haue made some mencion of, if it had been a necessary article of our fayth, to beleue that there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no bread nor wyne. Thus it is euident and plaine, by the wordes of scripture, that after co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secracion remayneth bread and wyne, and that the Papisticall doctrine of transubstantiation, is directly contrary to Gods worde.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9792:25"/>
worde, they be of great moment to confirme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truthe. Naturall reason abhorreth <hi>vacuum,</hi> that is to saie, that there shoulde be any empty place, wherin no substance shoulde be. But yf ther remain no bread nor wine, the place where they wer before, and where theyr accidentes be, is fylled with no substance, but remaineth <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi> cleane contrary to the order of nature.</p>
               <p>We se also that the wyne, though it be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, yet wyll it tourne to vyneger, and the breadde wyll mowle, whyche than be nothynge elles but sowre wyne and mowled bread, which could not waxe sowre nor mowly, if there were no breade nor wyne there at all.</p>
               <p>And if the sacramentes were nowe brent (as in the olde church they bourned all that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vneaten) lette the Papistes telle what is brente. They must needes saie, that it is eyther bread, or the body of Christe. But breade (saye they) is none there. Than muste they needes bourne the body of Christ, and be called Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourners (as heretofore they haue burned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his membres) except they wil say, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentes bourne alone without any substaunce, contrary to all the course of nature.</p>
               <p>The sacramentall breade and wyne also wyll nourishe, whiche nourishement naturally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of the substance of the meates and dryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and not of the accidentes.</p>
               <p>The wyne also wyll poyson, (as dyuers by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Rome haue had experiences, bothe in

poysonyng of other, and beyng poysoned them selues) whiche poysonyng they can not ascribe to the moste holsome bloud of our sauior Christ, but onely to the poysoned wyne.</p>
               <p>And most of all, it is against the nature of ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cidentes, to be in nothing. For the definition of accidentes, is to be in some substance, so that if they be, they must nedes be in some thyng. And yf they be in nothynge, than they bee not.</p>
               <p>And a thousand thynges mo, of lyke foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse doo the Papistes affirme by their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, contrary to all nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

               <p>Our faithe teacheth vs to beleeue thynges that we see not, but it doth not byd vs, that wee shall not beleue that we see dayly with our eies, and heare with our eares, and grope with our handes. For although our senses can not reache so farre as our faithe doothe, yet so farre as the compas of our senses doeth vsually reache, our faith is not contrary to the same, but rather our senses doo confirme our faith. Or els what auai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led it to S.

               <p>And what a wyde doore is here opened to Ua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lentinianus, Marcion, and other heretikes, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che sayde that Christe was not crucified, but that Symon Cyreneus was crucifyed for him, although to the syghte of the people, it seemed that Christe was crucified?

For if we ones admyt this doctrine, that no credite is to be geuen to our senses, we open a large field, &amp; geue a great occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto an innu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>merable rablement of most heinous heresies.</p>
               <p>And if there be no trust to be geuen to our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb facs="tcp:9792:27"/>
in this matter of the sacramente, why than do the Papistes so stoutely affirme, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentes remayn after the consecration? whiche can not be iudged but by the senses. For the scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pture speaketh no woorde of the accidentes of breade and wyne, but of the breade and wyne them selues. And it is againste the nature and diffinition of accidentes, to bee alone withoute any substance. Wherefore if we may not truste our senses in this matter of the sacrament, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if the substance of the bread and wyne be gone, why may we not then say, that the accidentes be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gon also? And if we must nedes beleue our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng the accidents of bread &amp; wine, why may we not do the lyke of the substance, &amp; that rather than of the accidentes? Forasmuche as after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secration the scripture saith in no place, that there is no substance of bread nor of wyne, but calleth them still by suche names as signifie the substances, and not the accidentes?</p>
               <p>And fynally, if our senses be dayly deceiued in this matter, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the sensible sacrament no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng els, but an elusion of our senses. And so we make muche for their purpose, that said that Christ was a crafty iuggler, that made thinges to appere to mens sightes, that in dede were no suche thynges, but formes onely, figures, and apparances of them.</p>
               <p>But to conclude in fewe wordes this processe of our senses, let al the Papistes lay their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des togither, and thei shal neuer be able to shew

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:9792:32"/>
For as the person of Christe consisteth of two natures, that is to say, of his manhod, and of his Godhead, (And therfore bothe those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures remayne in Christ,) euen so (sayth saynt-Augustin) the sacrament co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth of two natue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res, of the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of bread and wine, and of the body &amp; bloud of Christ, &amp; therfore both these na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures must nedes remayne in the sacrament.</p>
               <p>For the more playne vnderstandyng herof, it is to bee noted, that there were certayne herety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, as Simon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Menander, Marcion, Ualen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinus, Basilides, Cerdon, Manes, Eutiches, Manicheus, Apollinaris, and dyuers other of lyke sortes, whyche sayd, that Christ was very God, but not a very manne, althoughe in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge, drynkynge, sleapyng, and all other ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of man, to mens iudgementes he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered lyke vnto a man.</p>
               <p>Other there were, as Artemon, Theodorus, Sabellius, Paulus Samasathenus, Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Photinus, Nestorius, and many other of the same sectes, whyche sayd, that he was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry naturall man, but not very God, although in geuyng the blynd their syghte, the dumbe theyr speeche, the deafe their hearynge, in healyng so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deynly with his worde al diseases, in raysyng to life them that were dead, and in al other workes of God, he shewed himselfe as he had been God.</p>
               <p>Yet other there were which seyng the scripture so playne in those two matters, confessed that he was both God &amp; man, but not both at one tyme.
<pb facs="tcp:9792:33"/>
For before his incarnation (sayde they) he was God onely, and not man, and after his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ceased fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Godhead, &amp; became a man onely, and not God, vntyl his resurrection or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension, and then (saye they) he left his manhod, and was only God agayn, as he was before his incarnation. So that whan he was ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he was not God, and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was God, he was not man</p>
               <p>But against these vain heresies, the Catholike faith, by the expresse word of God, holdeth and beleueth, that Christ after his incarnation lefte not his diuine nature, but remained styll God, as he was before, beyng togyther at one tyme, (as he is styl) both perfect God and perfect ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>And for a playne declaracion hereof, the olde auncient authors geue two examples, one is of man, whiche is made of two partes, of a soule and of a body, and eche of these two partes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in man at one tyme. So that whan the soule, by the almyghty power of God, is put in to the body, neither the body nor soule perisheth thereby, but therof is made a perfect man, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng a perfect soule and a perfect body, remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng in hym bothe at one tyme. The other exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, whiche the olde authors brynge in for this purpose, is of the holy supper of our Lord, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che consisteth (say they) of two partes, of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament or visible element of bread &amp; wyne, and of the body and bloud of Christ. And as in them that duely receiue the sacrament, the very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of bread and wyne cease not to be there, but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9792:33"/>
remayne there styll, and be eaten corporally, as the body and bloud of Christ be eaten spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: so likewyse doth the diuine nature of Christ remayne styl with his humanitee.</p>
               <p>Let nowe the Papistes auaunt them selues of their Transubstantiation, that there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no bread nor wyne in the ministration of the sacrament, if they wyll defende the wicked heresies before rehersed, that Christ is not God and man both together. But to proue that this was the mynde of the olde authors, besyde the saiyng of sainct Augustyne here recited, I shall also reherse diuers other.</p>
               <p>Sainct Ihon Chrysostome wryteth against the pestilent errour of Apollinaris,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chrysosto. ad Cesarium monachum.</hi>
                  </note> whiche affir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med that the Godhead and manhead in Christ, were so myxed and confounded together, that they bothe made but one nature. Against who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sainct Ihon Chrysostome writeth thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whan thou speakest of God, thou must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder a thyng, that in nature is syngle, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out composition, without conuersion, that is inuisible, immortall, incircumscriptible, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible, with suche lyke. And whan thou speakest of manne, thou meanest a nature that is weake, subiecte to hunger, thyrste, wepyng, feare, sweatyng, and suche lyke passions, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che can not bee in the diuine nature. And whan thou speakest of Christ, thou ioynest two natures together in one person, who is bothe passible and impassible: Passible as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
<pb facs="tcp:9792:34"/>
his fleshe, and impassible in his deitee.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And after he concludeth, saiyng:
<q>Wherfore Christe is bothe God and man. God by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passible nature, and man because he suffred. He himeslfe beyng one person, one sonne, one Lord, hath the dominion and power of two natures ioyned together, whiche be not of one substance, but eche of theim hath his properties distincte from the other. And therefore remayneth there two natures, distincte, and not confounded. For as before the consecration of the bread, we call it bread, but <hi>whan Goddes grace hath sanctified it by the priest, it is deliuered from the name of bread, and is exalted to the name of the body of the Lorde, although the nature of the bread remayne stil in it,</hi> and it is not called two bodyes, but one body of Gods sonne: so likewyse here, the diuine nature resteth in the body of Christ, and these two make one sonne, and one person.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These wordes of sainct Chrysostome, declare and that not in obscure termes, but in playne wordes, that after the consecracion, the nature of bread remayneth styll, although it haue an hygher name, and bee called the body of Christ: to signifie vnto the godly eaters of that bread, that they spiritually eat the supernatural bread of the body of Christe, who spiritually is there present, and dwelleth in them, and they in him, although corporally he sytteth in heauen at the right hand of his father.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>The other example is of the sacrament of the body &amp; bloud of Christ, which (saith he) is a god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet <hi>the substaunce or nature of breade and wine, do not cease to be there styll.</hi>

               <p>Note well these wordes againste all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes of our time, that Gelasius (which was by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shop of Rome more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d years passed) writeth of this sacrament, that the breade and wyne cease not to be there styll, as Christ ceased not to be god after his incarnation, but remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned styll perfect god, as he was before.</p>
               <p>Theodoretus also affirmeth the same,<note place="margin">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And in his seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dialogue he saith more plainly.
<q>For (saith he) as <hi>the breade and wine after the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>secration lose not their propre nature, but kepe their former substance, forme, and figure,</hi> whiche they had before, euen so the body of Christ, after his ascention, was chaunged into the godlye sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce.</q>

                     <p>Math. 26 Mar. 14. Luc. 22. The an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swere.</p>
                  </note> that all the worlde can not answere therto, is this: Our sauiour Christ, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng the bread, brake it, and gaue it to his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, saiyng: <hi>This is my body.</hi> Nowe (say they) assone as Christ had spoken these woordes, the bread was straight way altered and chaunged, and the substaunce thereof was conuerted into the substaunce of his precious body.</p>
               <p>But what christian eares can paciently heare this doctryne, that Christe is euery day made a newe, and made of another substaunce, than he was made of in his mothers wombe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For where as at his incarnation, he was made of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and substaunce of his blessed mother, nowe (by these Papistes opinion) he is made euery
<pb facs="tcp:9792:37"/>
day of the nature and substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bread &amp; wyne, whiche (as they say) be turned into the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his body and bloud. O what a meruailous Methamorphosis, and abhominable heresye is this? to say, that Christ is dayly made a newe, &amp; of a newe matter? wherof it foloweth necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they make vs euery day a newe Christ, and not the same that was borne of the virgyn Mary, nor that was crucifyed vpon the crosse, as it shall be plainly proued by these argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes folowyng.</p>
               <p>Fyrst thus. If Christes body that was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed was not made of bread, but the body that was eaten in the supper was made of bread (as the Papistes say) than Christes body that was eaten, was not thesame that was crucified.</p>
               <p>And againe: If Christes body that was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, was not made of bread, and Christes body that was crucified was thesame that was eaten at his last supper, than Christes body that was eaten was not made of bread.</p>
               <p>And moreouer: If Christes body that was eaten at the last supper was the same that was crucifyed, and Christes body that was eaten at the supper was made of bread (as the Papistes fayne,) than Christes body that was crucifyed, was made of bread.</p>
               <p>And in lyke maner it foloweth: If the body of Christ in the sacrament, bee made of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bread and wyne, and thesame body was conceiued in the virgyns wombe, than the body
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9792:37"/>
of Christ in the virgyns wombe, was made of bread and wyne.</p>
               <p>Or els turne the argument thus. The body of Christ in the virgyns wombe was not made of bread &amp; wyne, but this body of Christ in the sacrament is made of bread and wyne, than this body of Christ is not the same that was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the virgyns wombe.</p>
               <p>Another argument. Christ that was borne in the virgyns wombe, as concernyng his body, was made of none other substance, but of the substance of his blessed mother, but Christ in the sacrament is made of another substance, than he is another Christ.</p>
               <p>And so the Antichrist of Rome, the chiefe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all Idolatry, would bryng fayfthul chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten people, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true worshippyng of Christ, that was made and borne of the blessed virgyn Mary, through the operacion of the holy ghost, and suffered for vs vpon the crosse, to worship another Christ made of bread &amp; wyne, through the consecracion of a Popishe priest.</p>
               <p>And thus the Popishe priestes make them selues the makers of God. For (say they) the priest by the woordes of consecracion maketh that thyng whiche is eaten and dronken in the Lordes supper, and that (say they) is Christ him selfe both God and man, and so they take vpon them to make both God and man.</p>
               <p>But let all true worshippers worship one god, one Christ, ones corporally made, of one only
<pb facs="tcp:9792:38"/>
corporall substance, that is to say, of the blessed virgyn Mary, that ones dyed, and rose ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, ones ascended into heauen, and there sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and shall sit at the right had of his father euermore, although spiritually he be eueryday amongest vs, &amp; whosoeuer come together in his name, he is in the myddes among them. And he is the spiritual pasture and foode of our soules, as meate and drynke is of our bodies, whiche he signifieth vnto vs by the institution of his most holy supper in bread and wyne, declaryng that as the bread and wyne corporally comforte and feede our bodyes, so doth he with his fleshe and bloud spiritually comfort and feede our soules.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere more directly.</note>And nowe may be easyly answered the Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes argument, whereof they do so muche boast. For bragge they neuer so muche of the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of bread and wyne into the body and bloud of Christ, yet that conuersion is spirituall, and putteth not awaye the corporall presence of the material bread and wyne. But for asmuche as the same is a moste holy sacrament of our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual norishement, (whiche we haue by the body and bloud of our sauiour Christ) there must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des remayne the sensible element, that is to say, bread and wyne, without the whiche there can be no sacrament.</p>
               <p>As in our spiritual regeneration there can be no sacrament of baptisme, if there be no water. For as Baptisme is no perfect sacrament of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual regeneration, without there be aswell the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9792:38"/>
element of water, as the holy ghoste, spiritually regenerating the person that is baptised (which is signified by the saide water) euen so the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our Lorde can bee no perfecte sacramente of spirituall foode, except there be as well bread and wine, as the body and bloode of our sauiour Christ, spiritually feeding vs, which by the said breade and wine is signified.</p>
               <p>And howe so euer the body and bloode of our sauiour Christ be ther prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, thei may as wel be present ther with the substance of bread &amp; wyne, as with the accidentes of the same, as the schole authors do confesse them selues, and it shall bee well proued yf the aduersaryes will denye it.

author, lefte out those woordes whiche would open plainly all the whole matter.
For next the wordes, which be here before of them recited, do folowe these wordes.<q> As in the person of Christ, the humanitee was seen, and the diuinitee was hyd, euen so dyd the diuinitee, ineffably putte it selfe into the visible sacrament. </q>Whiche wordes of Cyprian do manyfestly shewe, that the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth styll remayne with the diuinitee:
and that sacramentally the diuinitee is poured into the bread and wyne, the same bread &amp; wyne styll remainyng: like as thesame diuinitee by vnitee of person was in the humanitee of Christ, the same humanitee stil remainyng with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> diuinite.</p>
               <p>And yet the bread is chaunged, not in shape, nor substance, but in nature (as Cyprian truely sayth) not meanyng that the naturall substance of bread is cleane gone, but that by Gods word, there is added therto another higher propertie, nature and condition, farre passyng the nature and condicion of common bread, that is to saye, that the bread doth shewe vnto vs, (as the same Cyprian sayth) that wee bee partakers of the spirite of God, and moste purely ioyned vnto Christ, and spiritually feade with his fleshe and bloud, so that nowe the sayd misticall bread is both a corporall foode for the body, and a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual foode for the soule.</p>

                  </note>Another authoritee they haue of sainct Ihon Chrysostome, whiche thei boast also to be inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.
Chrysostome (say they) writeth thus in a certaine homely <q>
                     <hi>De Eucharistia. Doest thou see bread? Doest thou see wyne? Do they auoyde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, as other meates do? God forbyd, thynke not so.</hi> For as waxe (if it be put into the fyre) it is made lyke the fyer, no substance remayneth, nothyng is lefte: so here also thynke thou, that <hi>the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be consumed by the substance of the body.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>At these wordes of Chrysostome the Papistes do triumph, as though they had won the fielde. Lo (say they) doeth not Chrysostomus the great clarke say most plainly, that we se neither bread nor wyne? but that (as waxe in the fyer) they be consumed to nothyng, so that no substance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth? But if they had rehersed no more,<note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swere.</note> but the very next sentence that foloweth in Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome (which craftily and maliciously thei leaue out) the meanyng of sainct Iohn Chrysostome would easily haue appeared, and yet wyll make them blushe, if they bee not vtterly past shame. For after the foresayd woordes of Chrysostome, immediatly folowe these wordes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:9792:41"/>
                  <q>Wherfore (sayth he) whan ye comme to these mysteries, <hi>do not thynke, that you receiue by a man, the body of God,</hi> but that with tongues, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue fyer by the Angels Seraphyn.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And straight after it foloweth thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thynke that the bloud of saluacion floweth out of the pure and godly syde of Christ, and so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng to it, receiue it with pure lippes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brother, I pray you &amp; beseche you, let vs not be from the churche, nor let vs not be occupyed there with vaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, but let vs stand fearefull &amp; tremblyng, castyng doune our eyes, liftyng vp our myndes, mournyng priuely with out speache, and reioysyng in our heartes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These wordes of Chrysostome do folowe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, after the other woordes, whiche the Papistes before rehersed. Therfore if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes wil gather of the wordes by them recited, that there is neither bread nor wyne in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, I may aswell gather of the woordes that folowe, that there is neither priest nor Christes body.</p>
               <p>For as in the former sentence, Chrysostome sayth, that we may not thinke, that we see bread &amp; wyne: so in the second sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he sayth, that we may not thynke, that wee receyue the body of Christ of the priestes handes. Wherfore if vpon the second sentence (as the Papistes them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues wyll say) it can not be truely gathered, that in the holy Communion there is not the body of
<pb facs="tcp:9792:42"/>
Christ ministered by the priest: then must they confesse also, that it can not bee well and truely gathered vpon the fyrst sentence, that there is no bread nor wyne.</p>
               <p>But there be al these thynges together in the holy Communion, Christe himselfe spiritually eaten and drunken, and norishyng the right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuers, the bread &amp; wyne as a sacrament decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng the same, and the priest as a minister ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Wherfore S. Ihon Chrysostome ment not absolutely, to denye that there is bread &amp; wyne, or to denye vtterly the priest and the body of Christ to be there, but he vseth a speache, whiche is no pure Negatiue,<note place="margin">Negatiues by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</note> but a Negatiue by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.</p>
               <p>Whiche fashion of speeche, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly vsed, not onely in the scripture, and among all good authors, but also in all maner of languages. For when two thynges bee compared together, in the extollyng of the more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or abasyng of the more vyle, is many tymes vsed a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue by comparishon, whiche neuerthelesse is no pure Negatiue, but onely in the respecte of the more excellent, or the more base.</p>
               <p>As by example. When the people reiectyng the prophete Samuel,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 8.</note> desyred to haue a kyng, almightie God sayd to Samuel: <q>They haue not reiected thee, but me.</q>
Not meanyng by this negatiue absolutely, that they had not reiected Samuel (in whose place they desired to haue a kyng) but by that one negatiue by comparison
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9792:42"/>
he vnderstode two affirmatiues, that is to saye, that they had reiected Samuell, and not hym alone, but also y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had chiefely reiected God.</p>
               <p>And whan the prophet Dauid said in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son "of Christe,<note place="margin">Psal. 21.</note> I am a worme, and not a man. by this negatiue, he denyed not vtterlye, that Christe was a man, but (the more vehementlye to expresse the great humyliation of Christe) he said, that he was not abased onely to the nature of man, but was broughte so lowe, that he might rather be called a worme, than a man.</p>
               <p>This maner of speeche was familiar and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall to S. Paule,<note place="margin">Rom. 7,</note> as whan he sayde:<q> It is not I that doe it, but it is the synne that dwelleth in me.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> And in an other place he saithe: Christe sent me not to baptise, but to preache the gospel. And agayn he saith:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> My speche and preachyng, was not in wordes of mans persuasion, but in manyfest declaration of the spirite and power. And he saith also:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> Neyther he that grafteth, nor he that watereth, is any thynge, but God that gyueth the increase. And he saieth moreouer: It is not I that lyue,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. Gal. 6.</note> but Christ lyueth within me. And, God forbydde, that I shoulde reioyce in any thyng, but in the Crosse of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su Christe.<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.</note> And further, We doo not wrastle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste fleshe and bloudde, but agaynst the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of darkenesse.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In all these sentences, and many other lyke, although they bee negatiues, neuerthelesse S. Paule mente not, clerely to denye, that he dyd
<pb facs="tcp:9792:43"/>
that euyl wherof he spake, or vtterly to say, that he was not sent to baptise (who in dede did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise at certayn tymes,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> and was sent to do al thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges that pertained to saluation) or that in his office of settynge foorthe Goddes word, he vsed no witty persuasions, (whiche in deede he vsed moste discreetely) or that the grafter and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer bee nothyng, (whych be Goddes creatures, made to his similitude, &amp; without whose worke there shuld be no increase) or to say, that he was not alyue (who both lyued,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> and ranne from cun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey to countrey, to set foorth Goddes glory) or clerely to affirme, that he gloried and reioyced in no other thyng,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.</note> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Christes crosse (who re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ioyced with all men that were in ioye, and soro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed with all that were in sorowe) or to deny vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, that we wrastle agaynst fleshe and bloud: (whych ceasse not dayly to wrastle and warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst our enemies, the worlde, the fleshe and the dyuel.) In all these sentences S. Paule (as I sayde) ment not clerely to deny these thyngs, which vndoubtedly were all trewe, but he ment that in comparison of other greatter thynges, these smaller were not muche to be estemed, but that the greater thynges, were the chief thyngs to be consydered. As that syn committed by his infirmitie, was rather to be imputed to original syn, or corruption of nature, which lay lurkyng within hym, than to his owne will and consent. And that although he was sente to baptyse, yet he was chiefely sent to preache Goddes worde.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9792:43"/>
And that althoughe he vsed wyse and discreete persuasions therin, yet the successe therof came principally of the power of God, and of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng of the holy spirite. And that althoughe the grafter and waterer of the gardeyn be some thynges, and doo not a lyttell in theyr offyces, yet it is God chiefely, that geueth the increace. And that although he lyued in this worlde, yet his chiefe lyfe, concernyng God, was by Christ, whome he had lyuyng within hym. And that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he gloried in many other thynges, ye in his owne infirmitees,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. &amp;. 12.</note> yet his greattest ioy, was in the redemption by the crosse of Christe. And that althoughe oure spiryte dayly fyghteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste our fleshe,<note place="margin">Gal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note> yet our chiefe and principall fyght, is agaynst our gostely enemies, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till and puisant wicked spirites and diuels.</p>
               <p>The same maner of speeche vsed also S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his fyrste epistle,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> saiyng,<q> That the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayle of women, shoulde not be outwardly with broyded heare, and settynge on of golde, nor in puttynge on of gorgious apparayle, but that the inwarde man of the harte, shoulde be with out corruption.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In whyche maner of speche, he intended not vtterly to forbid al browderyng of hear, al gold and costly apparell to al women, (For euery one muste bee apparailed accordyng to their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, state and degree) but he ment hereby clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to condempne all pryde and excesse in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayle, and to moue all women that they should
<pb facs="tcp:9792:44"/>
study to deck their soules inwardly with al ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, &amp; not to be curious, outwardly to deck and adorne their bodies with sumptuous apparell.</p>
               <p>And our sauiour Christe hymselfe was full of "suche maner of speeches.<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> Gather not vnto you (saieth he) treasure vpon earthe. wyllynge vs therby, rather to set our myndes vpon heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treasure, whyche euer endureth, than vpon earthly treasure, whiche by many sundry occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions perysheth, and is taken awaye frome vs. And yet wordly treasure muste nedes bee had, and possessed of some men, as the person, tyme, and occasion dooth serue.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 10</note>Likewyse he said:<q> Whan you be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore kynges and princes, thynke not what and howe you shal answer.</q>
Not willyng vs by this negatiue, that we shuld negligently and vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly answere, we care not what, but that wee shoulde depende of our heauenly father, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stynge that by his holy spirite, he wyll suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entely instructe vs of answere, rather than to truste of any aunswere to bee deuised by oure owne wytte and study.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 10</note>And in the same manner he spake, whan he sayde:<q> It is not you that speake, but it is the spirite of God that speaketh within you.</q>
For the spirite of god is he that principally putteth god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wordes into our mouthes, and yet neuer the lesse we do speake accordyng to his mouyng.</p>
               <p>And to be short, in al these sentences folowing that is to saie:<q>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 23</note> Call no man your father vpon

               </p>
               <p>In all these negatiues, oure sauiour Christe spake not precisely &amp; vtterly to deny al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forsayd things, but in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison of them to prefer other thinges, as to preferre our father and lord in he<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen, aboue any worldly father, lord or master in earth, and his feare aboue the feare of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and his word and gospell aboue al worldly peace. Also to preferre spirituall and inward ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noryng of God in pure hart &amp; mynd, aboue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, corporal &amp; outward honor, and that Christe preferred his fathers glorye aboue his owne.</p>
               <p>Now forasmuch as I haue declared at length, the nature and kynd of these negatiue speches, (whyche bee no pure negatiues, but by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison) it is easy hereby, to make answere to S. Iohn Chrysostome, who vsed this phrase of speche moste of any author. For his meanynge in his foresayde homily, was not that in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Lords supper is neyther bread nor wyne, neither priest, nor the body of Christe (which the Papistes themselues must nedes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fesse) but his ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was, to draw our myndes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to heauen, that we shuld not consider so muche the bread, wine, priest, and body of Christ
<pb facs="tcp:9792:45"/>
we shuld consyder his diuinitee and holy spirite gyuen vnto vs to our eternall saluation.</p>
               <p>And therfore in the same place he vseth so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes these words, <hi>Thinke, and thinke not.</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyng vs by those wordes, that we shulde not fixe our thoughtes &amp; myndes vpon the bread, wine, priest, nor Christes body:
but to lyft vp our har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes higher vnto his spirite and diuinite, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whiche his body auaileth nothynge, as he saith hym selfe:<q>
                     <note place="margin">Iho. 6.</note> It is the spirite that gyueth lyfe, the fleshe auayleth nothyng.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And as the same Chrysostom in many places moueth vs, not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the water in baptisme, but rather to haue respect to the holy ghost, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceued in baptisme, and represented by the water: euen so doth he in this homily of the holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, moue vs to lift vp our mynds fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al visible &amp; corporal things, to thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs inuisible &amp; spiritual.</p>
               <p>In so muche that although Christe was but ones crucified, yet would Chrysostome haue vs to thynke, that we see hym dayly whypped and scourged before our eies, and his body ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gyng vpon the Crosse, and the speare thruste into his side, and the most holy bloud to flowe out of his syde into our mouthes. After whiche maner S. Paule wrote to the Galathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> that Christ was painted and crucified before their eies.</p>
               <p>

                     <note place="margin">Chrysosto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mus</note>Therfore saith Chrysostom in the same homily a litle before the place rehersed: What dost thou O man? dyddest not thou promise to the prieste whiche sayd: Lift vp your myndes and hartes.

               <p>Thus farre haue I rehersed the woordes of Saynt Ambrose, yf the sayd boke bee his (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they that bee of greatest learnyng and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement doo not thynke) by which woordes the Papistes would proue, that in the supper of the Lorde after the woordes of Consecration (as they bee commonly called) there remaineth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bread nor wyne, bycause that S. Ambrose saieth in this place, that the nature of the bread and wyne is chaunged.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</note>But to satisfie their myndes, let vs grant for their pleasure, that the forsaid boke was Saint Ambrose owne worke, yet the same boke maketh nothynge for their purpose, but quite agaynste them. For he saieth not, that the substaunce of bread and wyne is gone, but he sayth, that theyr nature is chaunged, that is to saye, that in the holy communion we oughte not to receaue the bread and wyne, as other common meates and drynkes, but as thynges cleane chaunged into a hygher estate, nature, and condition, to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as holy meates and drynkes, wherby we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue spirituall feedyng, and supernaturall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishement
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9792:47"/>
from heauen, of the very true body and bloud of our sauior Christ, through the om<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nipotent power of God, and the wonderfull wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kyng of the holy ghost. Whiche so well agreeth with the substance of bread and wyne styl remai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge, that if they were gone awaye, and not there, this our spirituall feedyng, coulde not be taught vnto vs by theim.</p>
               <p>And therfore in the most part of the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, whiche S. Ambrose allegeth for the wonderful alteration of natures, the substaunces dyd styll remayne, after the nature and proprieties were chaunged. As whan the water of Iordane (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his nature) stoode styll lyke a wall, or flowed against the streame towardes the head &amp; spryng, yet the substaunce of the water remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the same that it was before. Lykewyse the stone, that aboue his nature and kynde flowed water, was the selfe same stone that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And the fludde of Marath, that chaunged his nature of bytternesse, chaunged for all that no part of his substance. No more did that yron, whiche contrary to his nature, swam vpon the water, lose thereby any parte of the substaunce thereof. Therfore as in these alteracions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the substaunces neuerthelesse remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the same, that they were before the alteraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: euen so doeth the substaunce of bread and wyne remayne in the Lordes supper, and be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally receiued and digested into the body, not withstandyng the sacramental mutacion of the
<pb facs="tcp:9792:48"/>
same into the body and bloud of Christ. Which sacramentall mutation declareth the superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall spirituall and inexplicable eatynge and drynkynge, feedyng and digestyng of the same body and bloudde of Christe, in all theim, that godly and accordyng to theyr duetie, do receiue the sayd sacramentall bread and wyne.</p>
               <p>And that Saynt Ambrose thus ment, that the substance of breade and wyne remayne styll af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the consecration, it is moste clere by three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examples of the same mater, folowynge in the same chapiter. One is of theym that bee regenerated, in whome after theyr regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dooeth styll remayne theyr former naturall substaunce. An other is of the Incarnation of our Sauiour Christe, in the whyche peryshed no substaunce, but remayned as well the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of his godhead, as the substance whiche he tooke of the blessed vyrgin Mary. The third exaumple is of the water in baptisme, where the water styll remayneth water, although the holy ghost come vpon the water, or rather vpon him that is baptised therein.</p>

Yet in the same booke, &amp; in the same chapiter, he telleth in what maner and forme the same is done, by the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Christ: not by takyng away the substance

of the bread, but addyng to the bread, the grace of Christs body, &amp; so calling it the body of Christ</p>
               <p>And hereof he bryngeth .iiii. examples. The first of the regeneration of a man: the second is of the standyng of the water of the red sea: the third is of the bytter water of Marath: and the fourthe is of the yron that swamme aboue the water. In euery of the whyche exaumples, the former substance remayned stylle, not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng alteration of the natures. And he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the whole matter in these fewe woordes.
<q>If there be so muche strength in the woordes of the Lorde Iesu, that thynges had theyr begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge, whiche neuer were before, howe muche more be they able to worke, that those thynges, that were before, should remayn, &amp; also be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into other thynges?</q>

                  <hi>FYRST,</hi> if the Papistes be demanded, what thyng it is, that is broken, what is eaten, what is dronken, and what is chawed with the teeth, lyppes, and mouth in this sacrament, they haue nothyng to answere, but the accidences. For (as they say) bread and wyne bee not the visible ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this sacrament, but onely their acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. And so they be forced to saye, that acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes be broken, eaten, dronken, chawen, and swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed without any substance at all: whyche is not onely agaynst all reason, but also agaynste the doctrine of all auncient authors.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, these Transubstantiatours do say (contrary to al learnyng) that the accidentes of bread and wine do hang alone in the ayre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any substance, wherin they may bee staied. And what can be sayd more foolyshely?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that the substance of Christes body is there really, corporally and naturally present without any accidentes of the same. And so the Papistes make accidentes to be without substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, and substances to bee without accidentes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthely, they say, that the place where the bread and wyne bee, hath no substaunce there to fyll that place, and so must they nedes graunte
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9792:49"/>
                  <hi>vacuum,</hi> whiche nature vtterly abhorreth.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, thei ar not ashamed to say, that substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> is made of accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the breade mouleth, or is turned into worms, or wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wyne sowreth.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, that substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is norished without sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> by accidentes onely, if it chance any catte, mouse, dogge, or any other thyng, to eate the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall bread, or drink the sacramental wine</p>
               <p>These inconueniences and absurditees do fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe of the fond Papistical transubstantintion, with a numbre of other errors as euyll or worse than these, whervnto they bee neuer able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, as many of them haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed themselfs.</p>
               <p>And it is a wonder to see, how in many of the forsaid thynges, they vary among them selues.</p>
               <p>Where as the other doctrine of the scripture, and of the old catholike churche (but not of the lately corrupted Romyshe church) is playn and easy, as well to be vnderstanded, as to answere to all the foresayd questions, without any absur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditee or inconuenience folowyng therof: so that euery answere shall agree with Goddes worde, with the olde Churche, and also with all reason and true Philosophie.</p>
               <p>For as touchyng the fyrst poynt, what is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, what is eaten, what dronken, and what cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wed in this sacrament, it is easy to answere, The bread and wyne, as S. Paule saith: The bread whiche we breake.</p>
               <p>And as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng the second &amp; third pointes; neither is the substance of bread &amp; wine without
<pb facs="tcp:9792:50"/>
their proper accidentes, nor their accidentes hang alone in the ayre without any substaunce, but accordyng to all learnyng, the substance of the bread and wyne reserue their owne acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and the accidentes do rest in their owne sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stances.</p>
               <p>And also as concernyng the fourth poynt, there is no place lefte voyde after Consecracion (as the Papistes dreame) but bread and wyne fulfyll their places, as they did before.</p>
               <p>And as touchyng the fift point (whereof the wormes or moulyng is engendred, and whereof the vyneger commeth) the answere is easye to make (accordyng to all learnyng and experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) that they come, (accordyng to the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) of the substaunce of the bread and wyne to long kept, and not of the accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes alone, as the Papistes do fondly phantasy.</p>
               <p>And likewise the substances of bread &amp; wyne, do feede and norishe the body of them, that eate the same, and not the only accidentes.</p>
               <p>In these answeres is no absurditie nor incon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenience, nothyng spoken, either contrarye to holy scripture, or to natural reason, Philosophy or experience, or against any olde auncient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or the primatiue or catholike churche, but onely against the malignant and Papisticall church of Rome. Where as on the other syde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cursed synagoge of Antichrist, hath defined and determined in this matter, many thynges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christes wordes, contrary to the olde

catholike church, and the holy martyrs and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toures of the same, and contrary to all naturall reason, learnynge and phylosophy.</p>
               <p>And the final end of all this Antichrists doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is none other, but by subtelty and crafte, to bringe christian people from the true honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe of Christ, vnto the greatest ydolatry, that euer was in this worlde deuised: as by goddes grace shalbe plainly sette forth hereafter.</p>

               <p>They say, that in the sacrament, the corporall membres of Christe be not distaunt in place, one from another, but that wheresoeuer the head is, there be the feete, and wheresoeuer the armes be, there be the legges, so that in euery parte of the bread &amp; wyne, is altogither, whole head, whole feete, whole fleshe, whole bloud, whole hearte, whole lunges, whole brest, whole backe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither whole, confused, and mixte withoute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction or diuersitie.

For the satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our synnes, is not the deuocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor offeryng of the priest, but the only hoost and satisfaction for all the sinnes of the world, is the death of Christ, &amp; the oblacion of his body vpon the crosse, that is to say, the oblacion that Christ him selfe offered ones vpon the crosse, and neuer but ones, nor neuer none but he. And therfore that oblation whiche the priestes make dayly in their papistical Masses, can not be a satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for other mens synnes by the priestes deuocion, but it is a mere elusion and subtyll craft of the deuil, wherby Antichrist hath many yeres blyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and deceiued the worlde.</p>
               <p>They say, that Christe is corporally in many places at one tyme, affirmyng that his body is corporally and really present, in as many places as there be hoostes consecrated: We say, that as the sonne corporally is euer in heauen, and no where els, and yet by his operation and vertue, the Sonne is here in yearth (by whose influence
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9792:53"/>
and vertue, all thynges in the worlde be corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally regenerated, encreased and growe to their perfecte state.) so lykewise oure sauiour Christe bodely and corporally is in heauen, sittyng at the right hande of his father, although spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he hath promised to be present with vs vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yearth vnto the worldes ende. And whansoeuer two or thre be gathered together in his name, he is there in the myddes among them, by whose supernal grace all godly menne bee first by him spiritually regenerated, and after encreace and growe to their spiritual perfection in God, spiri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tually by fayth eatyng his fleshe and drinkyng his bloud, although the same corporally bee in heauen, farre distant from our sight.</p>

<q>We muste beleue and confesse, that the sonne of god (as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning his diuinite) is inuisible, without a body, immortal, and incircumscriptible, but <hi>as concernyng his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitee,</hi> we ought to beleue and confesse, that he

               </p>
               <p>Of these wordes of S.

For the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a very body, is to be in one place, and to occupie one place, and not to be euery where, or in many places at one tyme. And though the body of Christ, after his resurrection and ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, was made immortal, yet the nature therof was not chaunged, for than (as saint Augustyn sayth) it were no very body. And further sainct Augustyne sheweth, bothe the maner &amp; fourme, howe Christ is here present with vs in yearth, &amp; howe he is absent, saiyng, that he is present by his diuine nature and Maiestie, by this proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and by his grace, but by his humaine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and very body, he is absent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this worlde, and present in heauen.</p>

                  <q>If the worde and the fleshe were bothe of one nature, seyng that the word is euery where, why is not <hi>the fleshe</hi> than euery where? For <hi>whan yt was in earthe, than verily it was not in heauen: and nowe whan it is in heauen, it is not surely in yearth.</hi> And it is <hi>so sure, that it is not in earth,</hi> that as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng it, we looke for hym to come from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whom as concernyng his eternall woorde, we beleue to bee with vs in earthe: Therfore by your doctrine (saith Uigilius vnto Eutyches, who defended, that the diuinitee and humanite in Christe was but one nature) either the word is conteyned in a place with his fleshe, or els the fleshe is euery where with the worde. For <hi>one na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture can not receaue in it selfe two diuers and contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry thinges.</hi> But these two thinges be dyuers and farre vnlyke, that is to say, to be conteyned in a place, and to be euery where. Therfore in as mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che as the word is euery where, and the fleshe is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9792:60"/>
not euery where, it appeareth playnly, that one Christ hym self hath in hym two natures, &amp; that by his diuine nature, he is euery where, and <hi>by his humain nature, he is conteined in a place,</hi> that he is created, &amp; hath no beginnyng, that he is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to death, &amp; can not die. Wherof one he hath by the nature of his worde (wherby he is God) &amp; the other he hath by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nature of his fleshe, wher by the same God is man also. Therfore one son of God, the self same was made the sonne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and he hath a begynnynge by the nature of his fleshe, and no begynnynge by the nature of his Godheade. He is created by the nature of his fleshe, and not created by the nature of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. <hi>He is comprehended in a place, by the nature of his fleshe,</hi> and not comprehended in a place by the nature of his Godhead. He is inferiour to angels in the nature of his fleshe, and is equall to his father in the nature of his Godhead. He dyed by the nature of his fleshe, and died not by the nature of his Godhead. This is the faithe and catholyke confession, whyche the Apostles taught, the martyrs dyd corroborate, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people kepe vnto this daie.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All these be the saiynges of Uigilius, who (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to al the other authors before rehersed, and to the faith and catholike confession of the apostles, martyrs, and all faithfull people vnto his tyme) saith, that as concernyng Christes hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitee, whan he was here on erthe, he was not in heauen: and nowe whan he is in heauen, he
<pb facs="tcp:9792:61"/>
he is not in earthe. For one nature can not bee both conteyned in a place in heauen, and be also here in earthe at one tyme. And for asmuche as Christe is here with vs in earth, and also is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in a place in heauen, he proueth thereby, that Christ hath two natures in hym, the nature of a man (wherby he is gon from vs, and ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into heauen) and the nature of his godhed, wherby he is here with vs in erth. So that it is not one nature y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is here with vs, &amp; that is gone from vs: that is ascended into heauen, and ther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined, &amp; that is permane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t here with vs in erth</p>
               <p>Wherfore the Papistes (whiche nowe of late yeares haue made a newe faythe) that Christes naturall bodye is really and naturally present bothe with vs here in earthe, and sytteth at the ryght hande of his father in heauen, do erre in two very horrible heresies.</p>
               <p>The one, that thei confound his two natures, his godhead, &amp; his manhod, attributynge vnto his humanitee, that thyng, which appertaineth only to his diuinitee, that is to say, to be in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and erth, and in many places at one tyme.</p>
               <p>The other is, that they deuide and separate his humain nature, or his body, makyng of one body of Christ. ii. bodyes, and ii. natures, one whiche is in heauen, visible and palpable, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing al membres and proportions of a most per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect natural man, &amp; an other which they say is in erth here with vs, in euery bread and wyne that is consecrated, hauing no distinction, forme nor

And seyng that this hath been the true confession of the catholike fayth euer sithens Christes ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, it is nowe to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, what moued the Papistes to make a newe and contrary fayth, &amp; what scriptures they haue for their purpose. What moued them I knowe not, but their own iniquitie, or the nature and condicion of the sea of Rome, whiche is of all other most contrary to Christ, and therfore most worthy to be called the sea of Antichrist.

               <p>Christ toke bread (say they) blessed, and brake it, and gaue it to his disciples, saiyng: This is my body. These woordes they euer styll repeate and beate vpon, that Christe sayd, This is my body. And this saiyng they make their shote an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, to proue therby, aswell the real and nataral presence of Christes body in the sacrament, as their imagined Transubstantiation. For these woordes of Christ (say they) be most playne and
<pb facs="tcp:9792:62"/>
most true. Than forasmuch as he sayd, This is my body. it must nedes be true, that that thyng whiche the priest holdeth in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body. And if it be Christes body, than can it not be bread, whereof they gather by their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonyng, that there is Christes body really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and no bread.</p>

but that bread is Christes body, and that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body is bread. whiche all christian eares do abhorre to heare. Wherfore in these words must nedes be sought out an other sense and menyng, then the wordes of them selues do beare.</p>

By all these forsaid authors, and pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, with manny mo, it is playnely proued, that whan our Sauiour Christe gaue breadde vnto his Disciples: sayinge: Take, and eate, this is my body, And lykewise when he gaue them the
<pb facs="tcp:9792:64"/>
cuppe, sayinge: Diuide this amonge you, and drynke you all of this, for this is my bludde: he called than the very materiall bread his bodye, and the very wyne his bloudde.</p>
               <p>That bread (I say) that is one of the creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res here in earth amonge vs, and that groweth out of the earth, and is made of many graynes of corne, beaten into flower, and mixed with wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, and so baken &amp; made into bread, of such sort as other our bred is, that hath neither sence nor reason, &amp; finally that fedeth and nourisheth our bodies, suche bread Christe called his bodye, whan he sayd, This is my body. And such wine as is made of grapes pressed togyther, and ther of is made drynke, whiche norisheth the body, suche wyne he called his bloud.</p>
               <p>This is the true doctrine, confirmed as well by holy scripture, as by all auncient authors of Christes churche, bothe Grekes and Latines, that is to say, that when our Sauiour Christe gaue bread and wyne to his disciples, and spake these woordes, This is my bodye, This is my bloude. it was very bread and wyne whiche he called his body and bloud.</p>
               <p>Now let the Papistes shewe some authoritee for their opinion, eyther of scripture, or of some auncient author. And let theim not constrayne all men to folowe their fonde deuises, onely by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they sai, It is so, without any other grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or authoritee, but their owne bare wordes. For in suche wyse credite is to bee geuen to Goddes
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:9792:64"/>
worde onely, and not to the worde of any man.</p>
               <p>As many of theym as I haue redde (the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Wynchester only excepted) doo say, that Christe called not the bread his body, nor wyne his bloud, whan he said, This is my body, This is my bloude, and yet in expounding these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, thei vary amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them selfes: which is a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that thei be vncertain of their owne doctrine.</p>
               <p>For some of them saye, that by this pronoune demonstratiue (this) Christ vnderstode not the bread nor wyne, but his body and bloud.</p>
               <p>And other som say, that by the pronoune (this) he ment nether the bread nor wyne, nor his body nor bloud, but that he ment a particular thyng vncertayne, whiche they cal <hi>Indiuiduum vagum,</hi> or <hi>Indiuiduum in genere,</hi> I trow some Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall quiditee, they can not tell what.</p>
               <p>But let all these Papistes together shew any one authoritee, either of scripture, or of auncient author, either Greke or Latin, that saith as thei say, that Christ called not breade and wyne his body and bloud, but <hi>Indiuiduum vagum,</hi> and for my part I shall geue theim place, and confesse that they say trewe.</p>
               <p>And if they can shewe nothynge for theym of antiquitee, but onely their owne bare wordes, than it is reason that thei geue place to the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, confirmed by so many authoritees, both of scripture and of auncient writers, which is, that Christ called very material bread his body, and very wyne made of grapes, his bloud.</p>

When Christ had spoken these woordes, with many mo of the eatyng of his fleshe and drinkyng of his bloud, both the Iewes &amp; mani also of his disciples wer offended with his wordes, and sayd:
<q>This is an hard saiyng. For howe can he geue vs his fleshe to be eaten?</q>Christ perceiuing their murmuring heartes (because they knewe none other eatyng of his fleshe, but by chawyng and swalowyng) to declare that they should not eate his body after that sorte, nor that he ment of any suche carnall eatyng, he sayd thus vnto theim. 
<q>What if you see the sonne of man ascende vp where he was be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore? It is the spirite that geueth life, the fleshe auayleth nothyng. The wordes whiche I spake vnto you, be spirit and life.</q>

                  </gap>o thei should not eate him, for he would take his body away from them, and ascend with it into heuen.
And there by fayth, &amp; not with teeth, they should

spiritually eate him sittyng at the right hand of his father. <q>And therfore (sayth he) The wordes whiche I do speake, be spirite and life.</q>
that is to say, are not to be vnderstand, that we shall eate Christ with our teethe grossely and carnally, but that we shall spiritually &amp; gostly with our fayth eate him, beyng carnally absent from vs in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
And in suche wyse, as Abraham and other holy fathers did eate him, many yeres before he was incarnated and borne.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10</note> As S. Paule sayth,<q> that they did eate the same spiritual meate that wee do, and dranke the same spirituall drynke, that is to saye, Christe.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:9792:69"/>Of these places of sainct Chrysostome, sainct Hierom and sainct Ambrose, it is cleare, that in the sacramentall bread and wyne, is not really and corporally the very natural substance of the flesh and bloud of Christ, but that the bread and wyne be similitudes,<note place="margin">Signes &amp; figures haue the names of the thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges which thei signifie.</note> mysteries and representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, significations, sacramentes, figures and signes of his body and bloud: and therefore be called, and haue the name of his very fleshe and bloud.</p>
               <p>And yet S. Augustyne sheweth this matter more clearely and fully,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>August. ad Bonifatium Episto.</hi> 23.</note> than any of the rest, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in an Epistle which he wrote <hi>ad Bonifatiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> where he sayth, <q>that a day or two before good fryday, we vse in common speeche to say thus, To morowe or this day .ii. dayes, Christ suffered his passion. where in very dede he neuer suffered his passion but ones, and that was many yeres passed. Lykewise vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Easter day we say, This day Christ rose fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death. where in very deede it is many hundred yeres sithens he rose fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death Why than do not menne reproue vs as lyers, when we speake in this sort? But because we cal these dayes so, by a similitude of those dayes, wherein these thynges were done in deede. And so it is called that day, whiche is not that day in dede, but by the course of the yere is a like day. And suche thinges be sayd to bee done that day, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> solemne celebracion of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which thinges in dede were not done that day, but lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before. Was Christ offereed any more but ones?
<pb facs="tcp:9792:70"/>
And he offered him selfe, &amp; yet in a sacrament or representacion, not onely euery solemne feast of Easter, but euery day he is offered to the people, so that he doth not lye, that saith, he is euery day offered. For if sacramentes had not some simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or likenes of those thynges, whereof they be sacramentes, they could in no wyse bee sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. And for their similitude and lykenes, commonly they haue the name of the thynges, whereof they bee sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. Therfore as <hi>after a certayne maner of speeche, the sacrament of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body, is Christes body: the sacrament of Christes bloud, is Christes bloud</hi>: so lykewise the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of fayth, is fayth. And to beleue is nothyng els, but to haue fayth: And therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we answere for yong children in their baptisme, that thei be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, whiche haue not yet the mynd to beleue, we answere that they haue fayth, because they haue the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of fayth. And we say also that they turne vnto God, because of the sacrament of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion vnto God, for that answer partaineth to the celebracion of the sacrament. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse speaketh the Apostle of Baptisme, saiyng: that by Baptisme wee bee buryed with him into death: <hi>he sayth not, that wee signifie burial, but he sayth plainly, that we be buried.</hi> So that the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of so great a thing, is not called but by the name of the thyng it selfe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hytherto I haue rehersed the answere of S. Augustine vnto Boniface a learned Byshoppe, who asked of him, howe the parentes &amp; frendes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9792:70"/>
coulde answere for a yong babe in baptisme, and saye in his person, that he beleueth and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto God, when the childe can neither doo nor thinke any suche thinge.</p>
               <p>Whervnto the answere of S. Augustine is this that for as muche as baptisme is the sacramente of the profession of our faith, and of our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vnto God, it becometh vs so to answere for yong children comming thervnto, as to that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament appertaineth, although the children in deede haue no knowledge of suche thinges.</p>
               <p>And yet in our said answeres we ought not to be reprehended as vain men or liers, forasmuche as in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon speche we vse daily to cal sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and figures by the names of the things that be signified by them, although thei be not the same thing in dede. As euery Good fryday (as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it returneth from yere to yere) we cal it the dai of Christes passion: and euery Easter daye, we call the day of his resurrection: and euery day in the yeare, we saye that Christe is offered: and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his body, we call it his body: and the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his blud, we cal it his blud: and our baptism S. Paul calleth our burial with Christ And yet in very deede Christe neuer suffered but ones, neuer arose but ones, neuer was offered but ones, nor in very dede in baptisme we be not buried, nor the sacrament of Christs body is not his bodye, nor the sacrament of his bloud is not his bloud. But so they be called, bycause they be figures, sacraments, and representacions of the thinges theym selfe whiche they signifye, and
<pb facs="tcp:9792:71"/>
whereof they beare the name.</p>
               <p>Thus doth S. Augustine most plainly open this matter in his epistle to Bonifacius.</p>

but in significacion, as that bludde is the soule: vii. kyne be vii. yeares: vii. eares be vii. yeares: the stone was Christe.

               <p>Here the Papistes shewe their old accustomed nature and condition, whiche is (euen in a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest matter) rather to lye without shame, than to geue place vnto the truthe, &amp; confesse their owne errour.

               <p>And furthermore in his boke which he wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst heresies, he specially condemneth Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius by name. And also all his .iii. bookes of his dialoges before rehersed, he wrote chiefly agaist. Nestorius, and was neuer herein noted of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour this thousande yere, but hath euer been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:9792:75"/>
and taken for an holy byshop, a great ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, and a graue author, vntyl now at this present tyme, when the Papistes haue nothyng to answere vnto hym, they begyn in excusyng of them selues, to defame hym.</p>
               <p>Thus muche haue I spoken for Theodore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, which I praie the be not wery to rede (good reder) but often and with delectation, delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and good aduertisement to rede. For it con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teyneth playnly and brefely the true instruction of a christian man, concernyng the matter, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in this boke we treate vpon.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Fiue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges to bee noted in Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retus.</note> that our sauiour Christe in his last sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when he gaue breade and wyne to his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, (sayeuge: This is my bodye, This is my bloud) it was bread which he called his body, &amp; wyne myxed in the cuppe, whyche he called his bloud: so that he changed the names of the bread and wine (which were the misteries, sacraments, signes, figures &amp; tokens of Christes fleshe and bloude) &amp; called them by the names of the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which they dyd represent and signifie, that is to say, the breade he called by the name of his very fleshe, &amp; the wyne by the name of his blud.</p>
               <p>Second, that although the names of breade and wyne were changed after sanctification, yet neuerthelesse the thyngs them selues remayned the selfe same, that they were before the sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that is to say, the same breade and wyne in nature, substance, forme and fashion.</p>
               <p>The thyrde, seynge that the substance of the
<pb facs="tcp:9792:76"/>
bread and wyne be not chaunged, why bee then their names changed? and the bread called Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes flesh, and the wyne his bloud? Theodore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus sheweth, that the cause therof was this, that we shuld not haue so muche respect to the breade and wyne (whiche we see with our eies, and tast with our mouthes) as we shuld haue to Christe hym selfe, in whom we beleue with our hertes, &amp; fele and tast him by our faith, &amp; with whose flesh and bloud (by his grace) we beleue that we bee spiritually fedde and nouryshed.</p>
               <p>These thynges we ought to remembre and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolue in our myndes, and to lyfte vp our hartes from the bread and wine vnto Christ that sytteth aboue. And bicause we shuld so do, therfore after the consecration, they be no more called bread &amp; wyne, but the body and bloud of Christe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth. It is in these sacraments of bread and wyne, as it is in the very bodye of Christe. For as the body of Christe before his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and after, is al one in nature, substance, big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, forme and fashion, and yet it is not called as an other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon body, but with addition, for the dignitee of his exaltation, it is called a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, a godly, an immortal, and the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: so lykewyse the breade and wyne, before the consecration and after, is all one in nature, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, bygnesse, forme, and fashion, and yet it is not called as other common bread, but for the dignitee, whervnto it is taken, it is called with addition, Heauenly breade, the breade of lyfe,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9792:76"/>
and the bread of thankes gyuyng.</p>
               <p>The fift, that no man ought to be so arrogant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and presumptuous to affirme for a certayn truth in religion any thynge, whiche is not spoken of in holy scripture. And this is spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the great and vtter condemnation of the Papistes, which make and vnmake newe articles of oure faithe from tyme to tyme, at their pleasure, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny scripture at all, yea quite and cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to scripture. And yet wyll they haue all men bounde to beleue what so euer they inuent, vpon peryll of damnation and euerlastyng fyre.</p>
               <p>And they woulde constrayne with fyre and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotte all men to consent (contrary to the many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest woordes of God) to these their erroures in this matter of the holy sacramente of Christes body and bloude.</p>
               <p>Fyrst that there remaineth no bread nor wyne after the consecration, but that Christes fleshe and bloud is made of them.</p>
               <p>Seconde, that Christes body is really, corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, substancially, sensibly and naturally in the bread and wyne.</p>
               <p>Thyrdely, that wycked persones doo eate and drynke Christes very body and bloude.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that priestes offer Christ euery day, make of him a new sacrifice propiciatory for syn.</p>
               <p>Thus for shortnes of tyme, do I make an end of Theodoretus, with other olde auncient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which do moste clerely affirme, that to eate Christes body, and to drynke his bloude, be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue

               <p>And when Christe sayde,<q> This cup is a newe testament in my bloude. </q>here in one sentence bee two figures.

               <p>The fyrst is, that the breade in the sacramente is called the Lordes body: and the peeces of the broken bread be called the peeces and fragmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the Lordes body. whyche can not bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande, but fyguratiuely.</p>
               <p>The seconde is, that the bread oughte not to be reserued and hanged vp, as the Papistes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where doo vse.</p>
               <p>The third is, that the priests ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the sacrament alone (as the Papistes com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monly do, makyng a sale therof vnto the people) but they ought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with the people.</p>
               <p>And here it is diligently to bee noted, that we ought not vnreuerently and vnaduisedly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche vnto the meate of the Lordes table, as we doo to other common meates and drynkes, but with great feare and dreade: least we shulde come to that holy table vnworthely, wherein is not onely represented, but also spirytually ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto vs very <hi>CHRISTE</hi> hym selfe.

               </p>
               <p>Thus doth the Papistes (the aduersaries of Gods woorde and of his trueth) allege the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritee of Hilarius (either peruersely and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely, as it seemeth, vntruely cityng him, and wrastyng his wordes to their purpose) or els not truely vnderstandyng him.</p>
               <p>For although he sayth that Christe is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb facs="tcp:9792:85"/>

And neuerthelesse in so saiyng, he ment not of the natural and corporal presence of the substance of Christes body &amp; of ours (for as oure bodyes bee not after that sorte within his body, so is not his body after that sorte within our bodyes) but he ment that Christe in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnacion receyued of vs a mortall nature, and vnited the same vnto his diuinitee, and so be we naturally in him.</p>
               <p>And the sacramentes of Baptisme and of his holy supper (if we rightly vse the same) do moste assuredly certifye vs, that wee bee partakers of his godly nature, hauyng geuen vnto vs by him, immortalitee and life euerlastyng, &amp; so is Christ naturally in vs. And so bee wee one with Christ, and Christ with vs, not onely in wylle &amp; mynde, but also in very naturall properties.</p>
               <p>And so concludeth Hilarius against Arrius, that Christe is one with his father, not in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and wylle onely, but also in very nature.</p>
               <p>And as the vnion betwene Christe and vs in baptisme is spiritual, and requyreth no real and corporall presence, so lykewise oure vnion with Christ in his holy supper is spiritual, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requyreth no real and corporall presence.</p>
               <p>And therfore Hilarius speaking there of both the sacramentes, maketh no difference betwene our vnion with Christ in baptisme, &amp; our vnion with him in his holy supper. And sayth further, that as Christ is in vs, so be wee in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whiche

the Papistes can not vnderstand corporally and really, except they wyll say, that all our bodyes be corporally within Christes body. Thus is Hilarius answered vnto, both plainly &amp; shortly.</p>

<q>We denye not (sayth Cyril against the heretike) but we be spiritually ioyned to Christ, by fayth and syncere charitee: but that we shuld haue no maner of coniunction in our fleshe with Christ, that we vtterly deny, and thynke it vtter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly discrepant from Goddes holy scriptures.

slenderly, but substantially and perfectely, wyth all hys mighte and power: so that <hi>CHRIST</hi> was not onely a mortall manne, to suffre for vs, but also hee was immortall God, able to redeeme vs.</p>

<q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the consecration saith he (as they allege) it is bread, but after the woordes of consecration it is the body of Chryste.</q>

               <p>For answere herevnto, yt muste be fyrste kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen what Consecration is.</p>
               <p>Consecration is the separation of anye thing from a prophane and wordely vse,<note place="margin">Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on.</note> vnto a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and godly vse.</p>
               <p>And therfore whan vsual and common water is taken frome other vses, and put to the vse of baptisme in the name of the father and of the sonne, and of the holy ghost, than it may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called Consecrated water, that is to saye, water put to an holy vse.</p>
               <p>Euen so whan co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bread &amp; wine be taken &amp; seuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other bread and wyne, to the vse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, that portion of bread and wyne, although it be of the same substance that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whych it is seuered, yet it is nowe called consecrated or holy bread, and holy wyne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9792:88"/>Not that the bread and wine haue or can haue any holynes in them, but that they be vsed to an holy worke, and represent holy &amp; godly thinges. And therfore S. Dionyse calleth the breade,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De eccl Hie rar. cap.</hi> 3.</note> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breade, and the cuppe an holy cuppe, as soone as they bee sette vppon the aultate to the vse of the holy communion.</p>
               <p>But specially they maye be called holye and consecrated, when they be separated to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vse of Christes owne wordes, whiche he spake for that purpose,<note place="margin">Math. 26 Mat. 14. Luc. 22.</note> saying of the breade: This is my body, And of the wyne: This is my bloude.</p>
               <p>So that commonly the authors, before those wordes be spoken, do take the breade and wyne but as other common bread and wine, but after those woordes be pronounced ouer theym, than they take theym for consecrated and holy breade and wyne.</p>
               <p>Not that the bread and wine can be partakers of any holynes or godlynesse, or can be the body and bloode of Christ, but that they represent the very bodye and bloude of Christe, and the holy foode and nourishement, which we haue by him, And so thei be called by the names of the body &amp; bloud of Christ, as the signe, token and figure is called by the name of the very thinge, whiche it sheweth and signifieth.</p>
               <p>And therefore as S. Ambrose in the wordes before cited by the aduersaries, saith, that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the consecration, it is bread, and after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </p>
               <p>By whiche woordes of S.

               <p>And as the bread is a corporal meat,<note place="margin">

               <p>Thus farre they reherse of Chrysostomes wordes. Whiche woordes although they sound muche for their purpose, yet if they be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred with other places of the same author, it shall well appeare, that he mente nothyng lesse, than that Christes bodye should be corporally and naturally prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the bread and wyne, but that in suche sorte he is in heauen only, and in our myndes by fayth we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend vp into heauen, to eat him there, although sacramentally as in a signe and figure, he be in the bread and wyne (and so is he also in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Baptisme) &amp; in theim that rightly receiue the bread &amp; wyne, he is in a much more perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> than corporally (whiche should auayle them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng)

               </p>
               <p>These be the wordes whyche the Papistes do cite out of Theophilus vpon the gospel of saint Marke. But by this one place it appeereth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, either howe negligente the Papistes bee in serchyng out and examynyng the saiynges of the authors, which they allege for their purpose, or els howe false and deceytfull they be, whyche willyngly and wittyngly haue made in this one place, and as it were with one breath, two loude and shamefull lyes.</p>
               <p>The first is, that bycause they wolde geue the more authorite to the woordes by them alleged, they (like fals Potycaties that sell <hi>quid pro quo</hi>) falsifie the authors name, fatherynge suche say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enges vpon Theophilus Alexandrinus, an olde and auncient author, whiche were in dede none of his wordes, but wer the wordes of Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactus, who was many yeres after Theophilus Alexandrinus. But suche hathe euer been the Papisticall subtiltees, to set forth their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, dreames, and lyes, vnder the name of antiquitee and auncient Authors</p>
               <p>The second lye or falshod is, that thei falsifie the authors wordes and meanyng, subuertynge the truth of his doctrine. For where Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactus (accordynge to the catholike doctrine of auncient authors) sayth, that almightie God (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng to our infirmitee) reserueth the kynde of bread &amp; wyne, and yet tourneth them into the <hi>vertue</hi> of Christes fleshe and bloud: They saye
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9792:91"/>
that he reserueth the formes and apparances of bread &amp; wyne, and turneth them into the Uerite of his fleshe and bloud. so tornyng and alteryng kyndes into fourmes and apparances, and <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> into Ueritee, that of the vertue of the fleshe and bloud, thei make the veritee of his flesh and bloud. And thus haue they falsified as well the name as the wordes of Theophilactus, turnyng veritee into playne and flatte falsitee.</p>
               <p>But to sette foorth playnely the meanyng of Theophylactus in this matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As hot and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng yron is yron styll, and yet hath the force of fyer, and as the fleshe of Christ styl remainynge fleshe, geueth lyfe, as the flesshe of hym that is God: so the sacramentall bread &amp; wyne remayne styll in their propre kyndes, and yet to them that worthyly eate and drynke them, they be tourned not into the corporall presence, but into the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Christes fleshe and bloud.</p>
               <p>And although Theophylactus spake of the eatyng of the very body of Christ, and the drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng of his very bloud, (and not only of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of them) and of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion of the bread and wyne into the body and bloud of Christ, yet he meaneth not of a grosse, carnal, corporall, and sensible conuersion of the breade and wyne, nor of a lyke eatyng and drynkynge of his fleshe and bloud (for so not only our stomakes wold yerne and oure heartes abhorre to eate his fleshe and to drynke his bloude, but also suche eatyng and drynkynge could nothyng profit and auayle vs)

For he is but a yonge newe author in the respect of those which we haue brought in for our party And in diuers pointes he varieth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the most an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient authors (if he meane as thei expound him) as when he saith, that the bread and wine be not figures, which all the old authors call figures, and that the bread and wyne consume not, nor be auoyded downewarde, which Origen and S. Augustine affirme, or that they be not called the examples of Christes body after the consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whiche shall manyfestely appere false by the Liturgy ascribed vnto S.

               <p>And moreouer, the sayde Damascene was one of the byshoppe of Romes chiefe proctoures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Emperours, and as it were his ryght
<pb facs="tcp:9792:93"/>
hande, to set abroade all ydolatrye by his owne handewrytynge. And therefore yf he loste his hande (as they saye he dyd) he lost it by Goddes moste righteous iudgemente, what soeuer they faine and fable of the miraculous restitution of the same. And yet what so euer the sayd Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene writeth in other mattiers, surely in this place wiche the aduersaries doo alledge, he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth spiritually and godly, although the Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes either of ignorance mystake hym, or els wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngly wraste him and writhe hym to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, cleane contrary to his meanynge.</p>
               <p>The sum of Damascene his doctrine in this matter is this. That as Christ beyng both God &amp; man hath in him two natures, so hath he twoo natiuitees, one eternal, &amp; thother temporall. And so lykewise we (beyng as it were double men, or hauyng euery one of vs two men in vs, the new man &amp; the old man, the spirituall man &amp; the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man) haue a double natiuitee: One of oure first carnall father Adam (by whom as by anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inheritance cometh vnto vs malediction and euerlastyng damnation) &amp; the other of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Adam, that is to saye, of Christ, by whom we be made heires of celestiall benediction, and euerlastyng glory and immortalitee.</p>
               <p>And bycause this Adam is spirituall, therefore our generation by hym muste be spirituall, &amp; our feedyng muste bee lykewise spirituall. And our spirituall generation by hym is playnly set forth in baptisme, and our spirituall meate and foode
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9792:93"/>
is set foorth in the holy Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion &amp; supper of the Lorde. And because our sightes bee so feble that we cannot see the spiritual water wherwith we be washed in baptisme, nor the spiritual meat wherwith we be fedde at the Lordes table, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to healpe oure infirmities, and to make vs the better to see the same with a pure fayth, our sauiour Christ hath set furth the same, as it were before our eyes, by sensible signes and tokens, whiche we be daily vsed and accustomed vnto.</p>
               <p>And because the common custome of men is to washe in water, therfore our spiritual regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in Christe, or spirituall washyng in his blud, is declared vnto vs in baptisme by water. Lykewise oure spiritual norishement &amp; feadyng in Christ, is sette before oure eyes by bread and wyne, because they be meates and drynkes whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che chiefly and vsually we be fedde withal, that as they feade the body, so doth Christe with his fleshe and bloud spiritually feade the soule.</p>
               <p>And therefore the bread and wyne bee called examples of Christes fleshe and bloud, and also they be called his very fleshe and blode, to signi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fie vnto vs, that as they feade vs carnally, so do they admonishe vs that Christe with his fleshe and bloud doth feade vs spiritually, and moste truely vnto euerlastyng life.</p>
               <p>And as almyghty God by his moste myghty worde and his hollye spirite and infinite power brought forth all creatures in the begynnyng, and euer sithens hath preserued theym, euen
<pb facs="tcp:9792:94"/>
so by the same worde and power he woorketh in vs from time to tyme this meruailous spiritual generation &amp; wonderfull spirituall norishment &amp; feedyng, which is wrought onely by God, and is comprehended and receiued of vs by fayth.</p>
               <p>And as bread and drynke by natural norishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be chaunged into a mannes body, and yet the body is not chaunged, but the same that it was before: so although the bread and wyne be sacramentally chaunged into Christes body, yet his body is the same and in the same place that it was before, that is to say, in heauen, without any alteracion of the same.</p>
               <p>And the bread and wyne bee not so chaunged into the fleshe and bloud of Christ, that they bee made one nature, but they remayne styll distinct in nature, so that the bread in it selfe is not his fleshe, &amp; the wyne his bloud, but vnto them that worthely eate and drinke the bread and wyne, to them the bread and wyne be his flesh and bloud, that is to say, by thynges naturall and whiche they be accustomed vnto, they bee exalted vnto thynges aboue nature. For y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sacramental bread and wyne be not base and naked figures, but so pithy and effectuous, that whosoeuer worthely eateth them, eateth spiritually Christes fleshe and bloud, and hath by them euerlastyng life.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, whosoeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the Lordes table, must come with all humilitee, feare, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and puritie of life, as to receiue not onely bread and wyne, but also our sauior Christ, both
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9792:94"/>
God and man, with al his benefites, to the relief and suste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tacion both of their bodies and soules.</p>
               <p>This is briefly the summe and true meanyng of Damascene, concernyng this matter.</p>
               <p>Wherfore they that gather of hym, either the natural presence of Christes body in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of bread and wyne, or the adoration of the outward and visible sacrament, or that after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secracion there remayneth no bread nor wyne nor other substaunce but onely the substaunce of the body and bloude of Christe: eyther they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not Damascen, or els of wilful froward<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes they wyll not vnderstande hym: whyche ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seemeth to bee true, by suche collections as they haue vniustly gathered &amp; noted out of him.</p>
               <p>For although he say, that Christe is the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall meate, yet as in baptisme the holy ghost is not in the water, but in hym that is vnfaynedly baptised: so Damascene ment not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ is in the bread, but in hym y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worthily eateth the bred.</p>
               <p>And though he say that the bread is Christes body, and the wyne his bloud, yet he mente not that the bread considered in it selfe, or the wyne in it selfe, beyng not receyued, is his fleshe and bloud: but to suche as by vnfayned faith woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely receyue the breade and wyne, to suche the breade and wyne, are called by Damascene the body and bloude of Christe, bycause that suche persons, through the workyng of the holy gost, be so knytte and vnited spirituallye to Christes fleshe and bloude, and to his diuinitee also, that
<pb facs="tcp:9792:95"/>
they bee fedde with them vnto euerlastyng life.</p>
               <p>Furthermore Damascene sayeth not that the sacrament should be worshipped and adored, as the Papistes terme it (whiche is playne ydola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye) but we must worship Christ God and man. And yet we may not worship him in bread and wyne, but sittyng in heauen with his father, and beyng spiritually within our selues.</p>
               <p>Nor he sayeth not, that there remayneth no bread nor wyne, nor none other substaunce, but onely the substaunce of the body and bloud of Christe: but he sayeth playnely, that as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng coale is not wodde onely, but fyre &amp; wodde ioyned together. so the bread of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion is not bread onely, but bread ioyned to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitee. But those that say, that there is none other substance but the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the body and bloud of Christe, doo not onely denye that there is bread and wyne, but by force they must denye also, that there is either Christes diuinitee or his soule. For if the fleshe and bloud, the soule and diuinitee of Christe bee foure substances, and in the sacrament be but two of them, that is to say, his fleshe and bloud, than where be his soule and diuinitee?
And thus these men diuide Iesus, separatyng his diuinitee from his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitee. Of whom sainct Ihon sayeth,<q>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 4.</note> Whoso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>euer diuideth Iesus, is not of God, but he is Antichrist.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And moreouer these men do so separate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body from his membres in the sacrament,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:9792:95"/>
that they leaue hym no mans body at all. For as Damascene saith,<note place="margin">In librode duabus in Christo v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </note> that the distinction of membres pertayne so muche to the nature of a mannes body, that where there is no suche distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there is no perfecte mans body.</p>
               <p>But by these Papistes doctrine, there is no suche distinction of membres in the sacramente, for eyther there is no head, fete, handes, armes, legges, mouthe, eyes, and nose at all: or elles all is heade, all feete, all handes, all armes, all legges, all mouthe, all eyes, and all nose. And so they make of Christes body, no mannes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye at all.</p>
               <p>Thus beynge confuted the Papistes errours as well concernyng Transubstantiation, as the reall, corporall and natural presence of Christ in the sacrament, whiche were two principall poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes purposed in the begynnyng of this woorke.

               <p>This taught our sauiour Christe as well his disciples as the Iewes at Capernaum, that the eatyng of his fleshe and drynkyng of his bloude was not lyke to the eatyng of Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na.

               <p>In these woordes Athanasius declareth the cause why Christ made mention of his ascention into heauen, whan hee spake of the eatinge and drinking of his fleshe and blud.

               </p>
               <p>And moreouer S. Augustine,<note place="margin">

<q>Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of the one said, that as many as were christened, and receaued the sacrament of Christs body and bludde, shuld be saued, howe so euer thei liued or beleued, bicause that Christe saide: This is the breade that came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that whosoeuer shal eate thereof, shall not dye. I am the bread of life, which came from heauen, whosoeuer shall eate of this breade shall lyue for euer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Therfore (said these heretiques) all such men must needes be deliuered from eternall deathe,
<pb facs="tcp:9792:100"/>
and at length to be brought to eternall life. The other <hi>said, that heretiques and scismatiques myghte eate the sacrament of Chrystes bodye, but not his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye body, bicause they be no membres of his bodye.</hi> And therfore they promised not euerlasting life, to all that receaued Christes baptisme, and the sacrament of his body, but all suche as professed a true fayth, althoughe they lyued neuer so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlye. For suche (sayde they) doo eate the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of Christe, not only in a sacrament, but also in deede, bicause they bee membres of Christes body.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But Saint Augustine aunsweringe to bothe these heresyes, saith:<q> That neither heretiques, nor such as professe a true fayth in their mouths &amp; in their lyuyng shew the contrary, haue either a true faith (which worketh by charity and doth none euel) or are to be counted among the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of Christ. For they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be both membres of Christ and membres of the diuell. Therefore (saith he) <hi>it maye not be saide that any of theim eate the bodye of Christe.</hi> For when Christe saythe, he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my bludde, dwelleth in me and I in him. he sheweth what it is (not sacramentally, but <hi>in deede) to eate his bodye and drynke his bludde: whiche is, when a man dwelleth in Christe, that Christ dwelleth in him.</hi> For Christe spake those wordes, as if he should say: <hi>He that dwelleth not in me, and in whom I dwell not lette him not saye or thinke, that he eateth my body or drinketh my bloode.</hi>
                  </q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:9792:100"/>These be the plaine wordes of S. Augustine, that suche as liue vngodly, although they may seme to eate Christes body (because they eat the sacrament of his body) yet in deede they neither bee membres of his body, nor do eate his body.</p>
               <p>Also vpon the gospel of sainct Ihon he sayth,<q>

                        <hi>In Iohan. tractatu.</hi> 26.</note> that he that doth not eate his fleshe and drynke his bloud, hath not in him euerlastyng life. And he that eateth his fleshe, and drynketh his bloud hath euerlastyng life. But it is not so in those meates, whiche we take to sustayne our bodyes. For although without them we can not liue, yet it is not necessarye, that whosoeuer receyueth them, shall liue, for they may dye for age, sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or other chaunces.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But in this meat and drynke of the body and bloud of our Lord, it is otherwise. For both thei that eate and drynke them not, haue not euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng life: And <hi>contrary wyse, whosoeuer eate and drynke them, haue euerlastyng life.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Note and ponder well these wordes of sainct Augustyne, that the bread and wyne and other meates and drynkes (whiche norishe the body) a man may eate &amp; neuerthelesse dye: but the very body and bloud of Christ no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eateth, but that hath euerlastyng life. So that wicked men can not eate nor drynke them, for then they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des haue by them euerlastyng life.</p>
               <p>And in thesame place sainct Augustyne sayth further. <q>The sacrament of the vnite of Christes body and bloud, is taken in the Lordes table of
<pb facs="tcp:9792:101"/>
some men to life, &amp; of some men to death: but <hi>the thyng it selfe</hi> (wherof it is a sacrament) <hi>is taken of all men to life, and of no man to death.</hi> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer he sayth. This is to eate that meate and drynke that drynke, to dwell in Christ, &amp; to haue Christ dwellyng in him. And for that cause, <hi>he that dwelleth in him. And for that cause, he that dwelleth not in Christe, and in whom Christe dwelleth not, without doubt he eateth not spiritually his fleshe nor drynketh his bloud,</hi> although carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and visibly with his teethe, he byte the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his body and bloud.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus wryteth sainct Augustyne in the xxvi. Homelie of sainct Ihon. And in the next homelie folowyng,<note place="margin">

And he de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clared the maner of his gift &amp; distribution, howe he would geue his fleshe to eate, saiyng: He that eateth my fleshe &amp; drynketh my bloud, dwelleth in me and I in him. <hi>This therefore is a token or knowlege, that a man hath eaten and dronken, that is to say, if he dwell in Christe, and haue Christe dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng in him.</hi> If he cleaue so to Christe, that he is not seuered from him.

               </p>
               <p>By all these sentences of S.

               <p>If they saye no, than haue I my purpose, that euel men although they receaue the sacramente of Christes body, yet receiue they not his verye body. Yf they saye yea, Then I wolde aske them further, Whether they haue Christs spirit with in them or no?</p>
               <p>If they say nay, then do they separate Christs body from his spirite, and his humanitye frome his diuinite, and be condemned by the scripture as very Antichristes that diuide Christe.</p>
               <p>And yf they say yea, that a wicked man hathe Christes spirit in him, then the scripture also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus on euery side the scripture condemneth the aduersaries of goddes worde.</p>
               <p>And this wickednes of the Papistes is to bee wondred at, that thei affirme Christs flesh, blud, soule, holy spirite, and his deite to be a man, that is subiect to sin, and a limme of the diuell. They be wonderfull iuglers and coniurers, that with certayne woordes can make god and the dyuell to dwel togither in one man, and make him both the temple of god, and the temple of the diuell.

Thus is confuted this third intollerable errour and heresye of the Papistes, That they which be the lymmes of the diuell, do eate the very bodye of Christ, and drinke his bludde, manifestly and directly contrary to the wordes of Christ himself, who saith: <q>Who so euer eateth my flesh and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth my bludde, hath euerlasting life.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:9792:103"/>But S. Paule in that place speaketh of the eatinge of the breade and drinkinge of the wine, and not of the corporall eating of Christes flesh &amp; blud, as it is manifest to euery man that wyll read the text. For these be the words of S. Paul:
<q>Let a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> examine himselfe, and so <hi>eat of the bread and drynk of the cuppe,</hi> for he that eateth and drin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth vnworthely, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation, not discerninge the Lordes bodye.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In these wordes S. Paules mynde is, that for asmuche as the breade and wyne in the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des supper, do represent vnto vs the very bodye and blud of our sauiour Christe, by his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and ordinance, therfore although he sit in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at his fathers right hand, yet shuld we come to this mysticall bread &amp; wine with faithe, reuerence, purite and feare, as we wold do, if we should come to see and receaue Christe himselfe sensibly present. For vnto the faithfull Christ is at his owne holy table present, with his mightye spirite and grace, and is of them more frutefully receaued, than if corporally they shulde receaue him bodely present. And therefore they that shal worthely come to this goddes bord, muste after due triall of themselues, considre first, who ordai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned this table, also what meate and drinke they shall haue that come therto, and how thei ought to behaue themselues therat.

<pb facs="tcp:9792:104"/>
They that come therto, muste occupy their myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in considering howe his bodye was broken for them, and his blud shed for their redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. and so ought they to approache to this heauenly table with all humblenes of hart, and godlynes of minde, as to the table wherin Christe himselfe is gyuen. And they that come otherwise to thys holy table, thei come vnworthely, and do not eat &amp; drinke Christes flesh &amp; blud, but eat and drink their owne damnacion: bicause thei do not duely considre Christes very fleshe and blud, which be offered ther spiritually to be eaten and drunken, but dispising Christs most holy supper, do come therto as it were to other meates and drinkes, without regard of the lordes body, which is the spirituall meat of that table.</p>

For the intent of sainct Augustyne there, is to proue that good thinges auaile not to suche persons, as do euil vse them, and that many thynges whiche of them selues be good, and be good to some, yet to other some they bee not good. As that light is good for whole eyes, and hurteth soore eyes: that meate whiche is good for some, is euil for other some: One medicine healeth some, and maketh other sicke. One harnes doth arme one, and combreth another: one coate is mete for one, &amp; to straight for another. And after other examples, at the last S.

Howe muche lesse than could he thynke or allowe, that we should wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp the sacramentall bread and wyne, or any outwarde or visible sacrament? whiche bee sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, figures and representacions of Christes

very fleshe and bloudde.</p>
               <p>And saynt Augustin was afrayde, lest in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppyng of Christes very body, we shoulde of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende, and therfore he byddeth vs, whan we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp Christe, that we shoulde not tarry and fixe our myndes vpon his fleshe (whyche of it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayleth nothyng) but that we shuld lyfte vp but our myndes from the fleshe to the spirite, whiche giueth lyfe: and yet the Papistes be not afrayde by crafty meanes to induce vs, to worship those thynges, whyche be signes and sacramentes of Christes bodye.</p>
               <p>But what wyl not the shamelesse Papistes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for theyr purpose, whan they be not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to maynteyne the adoration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by these wordes of saynt Augustins? wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in he Speaketh not one word of the adoration of the sacrament, but onely of Christe hym selfe.</p>
               <p>And although he saie, that Christe gaue his fleshe to be eaten of vs, yet he ment not, that his fleshe is here corporally presente, and corporally eaten, but onely spiritually. As his wordes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare playnly, whyche folowe in the same place, where saynt Augustine as it were in the persone of Christe, speaketh these wordes.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is the spirite that geueth lyfe, but <hi>the fleshe profiteth nothynge. The wordes whiche I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto you, be spirite and lyfe. That whiche I haue spoken, vnderstande you spiritually. You shall not eate this body, which you se,</hi> and drynke that blud whyche they shall shedde, that shall crucifie me.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:9792:108"/>
I haue commended vnto you a sacramente, <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande it spiritually,</hi> and it shall geue you lyfe. And although it must bee visibly minystred, yet it muste be inuisibly vnderstande.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These wordes of sayncte Augustine with the other before recited, do expresse his mynd playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, that Christe is not otherwyse to bee eaten than spiritually, (whyche spirituall eatynge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth no corporall presence) and that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to teache heere any adoration, eyther of the visible sacramentes, or of any thyng that is corporally in them. For in dede there is nothyng really and corporally in the bread to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, although the Papistes say, that Christe is in euery consecrated breade</p>
               <p>But our Sauiour Christe hym selfe hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs warnyng before hande, that suche false christians and false teachers shoulde come, and hath bydde vs to beware of them,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> sayeng: <q>

<q>Although the high priestes of the olde lawe offered many tymes (at the least e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery yere ones) yet Christe offereth not him selfe many tymes,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.

               </p>
               <p>And furthermore S. Paule sayth, <q>That the

sacrifices of the olde lawe, although they were contynually offered from yere to yere, yet could they not take away synne, nor make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perfect. For if they coulde ones haue quieted mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> by takyng away sinne, they shuld haue ceassed and no more haue ben offred. But Christ with ones offeryng, hath made perfect for euer, theym that be sanctified: puttyng their synnes cleane out of goddes remembrance. And where remission of sinnes is, there is no more offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge for synne.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And yet further he sayth, concernynge the old testament, that it was <q>disanulled and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> bycause of the feblenesse and vnprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse therof, for it brought nothyng to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is able perfectly to saue theim that come to God by hym, for as muche as he lyueth euer to make intercession for vs. For it was meete for vs to haue suche an high priest, that is holy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, without spotee, separated from synners, and exalted vp aboue heauen: who needeth not daily to offer vp sacrifice (as Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s priestes did) fyrst for his owne synnes, and than for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For that he dyd ones, whan he offered vp hym selfe.</q>
Here in his Epistle to the Hebrues,
<pb facs="tcp:9792:111"/>
S. Paule hath plainly and fully described vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, the difference betwene the priesthode and sacrifices of the olde testamente, and the moste high and worthy priesthode of Christe, his most perfect and necessary sacrifice, and the benefitte that commeth to vs thereby.</p>
               <p>For Christ offred not the blud of calues, shepe and goates (as the priestes of the old lawe vsed to doo) but he offered his owne bloud vpon the Crosse. And he went not into an holy place made by mans hande (as Aaron dyd) but he ascended vp into heauen, where his eternall father dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and before hym he maketh continuall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for the synnes of the whole worlde, pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sentynge his owne body, whyche was torne for vs, and his precious bloud, whyche of his most gracious and liberall charitee, he shedde for vs vpon the Crosse.</p>
               <p>And that sacrifice was of suche force, that it was no nede to renewe it euery yere, as the bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops dyd of the olde testament, (whose sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

distinction and diuersitee of sacrifices.</p>
               <p>One kynd of sacrifice ther is, whiche is called a Propiciatorie or mercyfull sacrifice, that is to saie, suche a sacrifice as pacifieth Gods wrathe and indignation, and obteyneth mercye and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes for all our synnes, and is the raunsome for our redemption from euerlastyng damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>And although in the old testament there were certain sacrifices called by that name yet in very dede there is but one such sacrifice,<note place="margin">The sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christe.</note> whereby our sinnes be pardoned, &amp; gods mercy &amp; fauour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined (which is the deth of the son of God oure Lord Iesu Christ) nor neuer was any other sacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice propiciatorie at any tyme, nor neuer shalbe.</p>
               <p>This is the honoure and glorie of this oure high priest, wherin he admitteth neither partner nor successour. For by his one oblation he satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his father for all mens synnes, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led mankynd vnto his grace and fauoure. And who soeuer depriue hym of this honour, and go about to take it to them selues, they be very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristes, &amp; most arrogant blasphemers against God, and against his sonne Iesus Christ, whom he hath sente.</p>
               <p>An other kynde of sacrifice there is, whyche dothe not reconcile vs to God, but is made of them that be reconciled by Christe, to testifie our dueties vnto god, and to shew our selues thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto hym. And therfore they be called Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of laude, praise and thankes geuyng.</p>

He was so perfect a priest, that by one oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he purged an infinite heape of synnes, leauyng an easy and a redy remedy for all synners, that his one sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice shulde suffise for many yeeres, vnto all men that woulde not shewe them selues vnworthye.

that vntyl his commyng agayn, shuld truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in his gospell.

               <p>Thus the scripture teacheth, that yf Christe hadde made any oblation for synne more than ones, he shoulde haue dyed more thanne ones: for as muche as there is none oblation and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifyce for synne, but onely his deathe.

neither regardyng the godly decree of the most famous &amp; holy counsail of Nice (which appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in what order priestes should be placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue Deacons at the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion,<note place="margin">

               <p>Therefore when the olde fathers called the Masse or supper of the Lorde a Sacrifice, they ment that it was a sacrifice of laudes &amp; thankes geuyng (and so aswel the people as the priest do sacrifice) or els that it was a remembraunce of the very true sacrifice propitiatorye of Christe: but they ment in no wyse that it is a very true sacrifice for sinne, and applicable by the priest to the quicke and dead.</p>
               <p>For the priest may well minister Christes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and sacramentes, to all men both good and bad, but he can applye the benefite of Christes passion to no man (beyng of age and discrecion) but onely to suche as by their owne fayth do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye the same vnto them selues.
